REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY, (a) Composition and Terms of Reference.1. On the 14th March, 1980, the Prime Minister appointed a-Committee of the Economic Advisory Council with the following: terms of reference : To consider the obstacles which stand in the way of the education and supply of biologists for work in this country and overseas, and to submit recommendations for the removal of such obstacles.2.   The Committee is constituted as follows : The Eight Hon. Viscount Chelmsford, G.C.S.I., G.C.M.G.,. G.C.I.E., G.B.E., Chairman.Professor P. L. Engledow, Drapers&apos; Professor of Agriculture, Cambridge University.Mr. W. C. Fletcher, C.B., late Chief Inspector of secondary schools. Sir William B. Hardy, F.E.S.Sir James C. Irvine, C.B.E., F.E.S., Principal and Vice-chancellor, University of St. Andrews.Sir Charles Grant Eobertson, C.V.O., Vice-Chancellor,. Birmingham University.Mr. W. W. Vaughan, M.V.O., Headmaster, Rugby School.Mr.   A.   F.   Hemming,   C.B.E.,^Joint Secretary, Economic \ Joint Secretaries. Advisory Council f       to the. G. H. Creasy, Colonial OfficeCommittee.(b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.8. On the 26th March, 1930, we held a preliminary meeting for the purpose of laying down the procedure to be followed in our inquiry. We decided at the outset to secure as full information as possible on the present and prospective needs for biologists of Government Departments in this country and of the various Governments in the Empire overseas, and to supplement the material so collected with as full information as we could obtain regarding the openings for biologists at the Universities and in industry. On this side of our inquiry we invited evidence from the Board of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Colonial Office, the Medical Research Council, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Scottish Education Depart-ment, the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and other-Departments directly or indirectly interested in the recruitment of biologists for Government service. On the question of the recruit-ment of specialists, we sought the assistance of the Directors of the various Imperial scientific bureaux, e.g., the Imperial Bureau (now Institute) of Entomology, the Imperial Bureau of Mycology (now Imperial Mycological Institute), &amp;c. We also invited evidence from the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and from the&apos; Oxford and Cambridge Universities Appointments Boards.4. At the same time we decided to inform the Dominions Office, the India Office, and the Foreign Office (in respect of the Sudan) of the appointment of our Committee and to invite them to assist our inquiry by obtaining for us any available information regarding the present and prospective openings in the Dominions, in India, and in the Sudan respectively for biologists trained in this-country. In the light of the foregoing inquiries we hoped that we should be enabled to form an approximate estimate of the size of the problem from the point of view of the numbers affected. [22409] 3 2
5. Turning to the question of the facilities for the training of biologists, we decided to obtain as full evidence as possible regarding the existing arrangements both in the secondary schools and at the universities. For the secondary schools we relied in the main on evidence furnished to us by the Board of Education, the Scottish Education Department, the Science Masters&apos; Association and a number of school science teachers. As regards the universities, we invited the several examination boards concerned with the first or second schools examination to furnish us with particulars of the number of candidates offering biological subjects, together with an indication of how far those candidates are distributed amongst the various biological subjects offered. At the same time we invited an expression of opinion by those authorities on the obstacles, if any, that stand in the way of the education of biologists in this country. In the course of our inquiry we also received valuable evidence from a number of witnesses with wide experience of the teaching of biology at the universities.6. Among the written material placed at our disposal at the outset of the inquiry were the Beport of the Committee on the Colonial Agricultural Service (Cmd. 3049), the Beport of the Committee on the Colonial Veterinary Service (Cmd. 8261), and the Beport of the Committee on the System of Appointment in the Colonial Office and the Colonial Services (Cmd. 3554). We have also had an opportunity of studying the Beport of the Imperial Agricultural Besearch Conference, 1927.7. On various aspects of our inquiry we received oral evidence on behalf of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Besearch, the Medical Besearch Council, the Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), from individual teachers in biology at the universities and in the schools, and from Directors of scientific Besearch Institutes and Bureaux.8. In June 1930 the Colonial Office Conference took place, and, as the question of unifying the Colonial Services and, in particular, the organisation of a unified Agricultural Service were to be discussed by the Conference, we submitted on the 14th June an Interim Beport (Council paper E.A.C. (C.) 49), in which we gave the reasons why, in our view, it would be hard to over-emphasise the importance of a unified Colonial Agricultural Service from the point of view of recruiting biologists for service in the Colonies. The Economic Advisory Council at their meeting held on the 19th June, 1930 (E.A.C./5th Meeting, Conclusion 5), approved this Beport and invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to communicate it to the Colonial Office Conference, so that in their consideration of the proposals for a Colonial Agri-cultural Service they might be fully aware of the importance of the subject from the point of view of recruiting biologists for service in their several territories. A summary of the proceedings of that Conference has since been presented to Parliament (Cmd. 3628) and we welcome the progress that has been made in the direction of unification.9. We held fourteen meetings for the purpose of taking oral evidence. A full list is given in Appendix I (o) to this Beport of the witnesses who gave oral evidence before us. In addition, we were furnished with memoranda on particular points by a large number of educational and other authorities. Particulars regarding these are given in Appendix I (b).10. We desire to place on record our indebtedness to all who have assisted us in our inquiry, whether by giving oral evidence before us or by furnishing memoranda.(o) Arrangement of Report.11. In preparing our Report we have thought it convenient at the outset to indicate its scope by defining the classes of biologists covered by our terms of reference (Section II). In Section III we discuss the dimensions of the problem. In this Section we draw attention to the obstacles which, in our view, at present stand in
the way of the education and supply of biologists in this country and make certain suggestions, the adoption of which would, we believe, go some way towards the removal of such obstacles.12. The remaining Sections of the Eeport deal with the position of biology in the educational system of this country. In Section IV we discuss the position of biology in the secondary schools, and, in Section V, at the universities. In Section VI we describe the existing facilities for post-graduate training in pure and applied biology at universities and at research stations. In Section VII we discuss the various classes of biologists covered by our terms of reference and the steps which have, been taken to foster their supply. In Section VIII we state our recommendations and these, with our principal conclusions, are summarised in Section IX.13. We have attached to our Beport Appendices dealing with various aspects of our inquiry in greater detail than we thought desirable to include in the body of our Eeport. In Appendix II we have collected a number of notes on statistical questions to which reference is made in the text of our Eeport. In Appendix III we give particulars regarding the facilities for the teaching of biology at Oxford and Cambridge, at London University, at the English Provincial Universities, at the University of Wales, and at the Scottish Universities. Of these memoranda, three were prepared by members of our Committee, that on Cambridge by Sir William Hardy, that on the English Provincial Universities by Sir Charles Grant Eobertson, and that on the Scottish Universities by Sir James Irvine. For the memorandum on Oxford we are indebted to Mr. G. E. de Beer, for that on London University to Professor D. M. S. Watson, F.E.S., and for that on the University of Wales to the authorities of that University.II.-THE MAIN DIVISIONS OF BIOLOGY.14. Before attempting to describe the obstacles that stand in the way of the education and supply of biologists, we think it convenient in the following paragraphs to outline the main divisions into which biology falls, and to indicate which of those divisions are included in our terms of reference.15. Speaking very generally a biologist may be defined as a person skilled in the science of life. This definition covers both pure and applied biologists and those who concern themselves with the normal and those who concern themselves with the abnormal. The principal divisions in which biology is usually classified are more historical than scientific. Indeed, the only broad distinction that can be made between the various categories is that between animals and plants. Subject to this reservation, biology may roughly be divided under the following headings: (-a) Zoology and botany, as the general sciences of animals and plants.(b) Animal and plant physiology, as the special -sciences of normal function.(c) Animal and plant pathology, as the special sciences of abnormal function.16. The advance of knowledge has led naturally to the growth of specialisation, sub-groups in each of the foregoing main categories now receiving the whole time attention of research workers. Among such sub-divisions there may be cited bacteriology, mycology, parasitology, protozoology, cytology (the structure of the cell), and embryology. Bacteriology may. be defined as the science of certain simple but highly specialised plants, but in practice it usually means little more than the intensive study of the action of those plants as the agents of disease or putrefaction. On the other hand, mycology, the study of  fungi,  is  wider than its  title,  since,   until  recently,   the
Iimycologist was not only a student of fungi, but was almost the only student of plant diseases. In addition, there are such border-line sciences as biochemistry and biophysics. The former, which, till some thirty years ago, was known as physiological chemistry, deals with the chemistry of living matter. At its highest it is a branch of physiology and looks narrowly into chemical change occurring within living matter. At its lowest, it is a subordinate branch of organic chemistry. Biophysics, the physics of living matter, has hardly attained recognition as a separate branch of science. It is at present to be found in the physiological&apos; laboratory.17. Turning to applied biology, the main divisions are human and veterinarj&apos; medicine, a great part of agriculture, some part of forestry, the storage of food, fishery research, economic entomology, and some parts of various industrial activities such as brewing, with industrial applications of fermentation in, e.g., the production of acetone and of certain alcohols.18. We are not as a Committee concerned with the require-ments of human medicine except in so far as it involves a drain on the number of potential biologists of every class and is a potent factor in determining the form given to biological education in secondary schools. Of the other branches of applied biology, agriculture requires the services of fully trained biologists who, have a broad knowledge of the science of animals and plants. Fishery research calls for fully trained biologists. Forestry also requires the assistance of various classes of fully trained biologists, e.g., economic entomologists, mycologists, &amp;c. We are convinced that in the future development of forestry the biological sciences will play a responsible part, though we recognise that, according to the evidence we have received, forestry officers themselves do not require any extensive biological training, their main duties being concerned with such technical matters as forest survey, methods of transport, &amp;c. Entomological research requires fully trained biologists, but for entomological field control partly trained biologists are adequate. This is also true to a large extent of workers in taxonomic entomology. The storage and transport of food needs the services of fully trained biologists for research, and it may be confidently anticipated that, with the progressive introduction of scientific methods, there will be more openings than at present in this field for the services of men with some training in general biology. At present, only very limited biological knowledge is required in other industrial applications of biology.19. We have not included natural history in the foregoing outline, though rightly defined it is a recognisably distinct branch of biology with problems of its own, such as migration,, protective colouration, and the effect of soil upon population. Many of these problems are as important as those in other branches of biology. In the past natural history has, however, been the special province of the amateur, attracted by the oppor-tunities for field observation, but, with a better appreciation of the complexity of the problems involved, natural history, as defined above, is likely to become as much a specialist branch as any other in biology.&apos;20. It will be seen from the foregoing that it is almost impossible to give a simple answer to the questions what is a biologist or what kind of biologists are required? It is apparent that there are many kinds of biologists differing both in the quality and in the quantity of the science of life in which they are required to be skilled. Broadly, however, it may be said that for teaching, agriculture, fisheries, the food industry both on the research side and in management, and for all forms of specialised research, biologists with an all-round training are required, and by all-round training we mean one founded upon a broad scientific education of a university Honours standard. These form, in effect, the general pool of biologists, and it is with them that we are principally concerned in this Beport.
III. THE DIMENSIONS  OF  THE  PROBLEM   AND  THE NEED  FOR  CERTAINTY.21. It was of the first importance that we should ascertain, as far as possible, and at the earliest possible moment, how large or how small the problem was with which we were confronted. If, for instance, the demand for various classes of biologists were relatively small, or if the supply of suitable candidates were substantially adequate, our task would in the main be confined to the consideration of possible improvements in the methods by which biology is taught in schools and universities, and at centres of post-graduate study. If, however, we were to find that there was a large and growing demand for certain classes of biological workers, the position would be materially altered, as it would then be necessary for us to consider what methods should be adopted to increase the supply of qualified candidates.22. It was for this reason that we invited (see paragraph 8) those Departments of State whose work is in any way connected with biology to furnish us with particulars regarding the present number of biological posts on their respective establishments, the probable number of vacancies (on account of normal wastage or increase in the number of posts) during the next few years, the salaries offered, the methods of recruitment in force, and the number and quality of the candidates now offering themselves for such posts. We also received evidence from representatives of industry and of universities and schools.23. We have tabulated the particulars that we have received, and they are to be found in Appendix II (Notes 1 and 2). It is unnecessary for the purpose of our inquiry to analyse them or endeavour to state the demand for biologists in precise arithmetical terms indeed, the Departments themselves, through their witnesses, deprecated such an attempt being made. But their evidence, along with that received from the Departments as to the. supply forthcoming to meet this demand, satisfied us that there is at the present moment a demand for biologists for Govern-ment employment beyond the supply of men adequately qualified who are coming forward. And when we add to this the coincident demands of industry and of teaching we find that there is a shortage of qualified biologists. Moreover, we cannot ignore the fact that Governments are developing their biological services; industry is coming to appreciate more fully the possibilities of advance on the biological side; universities and schools pari passu will be requiring a larger number of teachers to produce the biologists who are to satisfy this demand on the part of Governments and industry.24. The demand then exists and is increasing, but there is an additional reason why we should not attempt to state the problem in terms of quantity only because it is in large measure one of quality. Many witnesses laid emphasis on the special qualities required of those whom it was desired to enlist, whether for posts in which personal qualities were the main desideratum, or where the peculiar nature of the posts demanded high and specialised qualifications. And the evidence was clear on this side of the problem that the supply was not equal to the demand; even where the supply of candidates was sufficient in quantity, the verdict of the witnesses was that it was deficient in quality.25. The position as regards the production of teachers is rather different in the grant-aided schools from what it is in the non-grant-aided schools. In the former a larger percentage of students are definitely preparing themselves for educational work in later life, but in the latter most of the boys who take biology beyond an elementary stage do so with a view to entering the medical profession. It was indeed to meet this demand that these schools first introduced biology into their curriculum. From the outset, therefore, the requirements of medicine have constituted a serious drain on the pool of biologists. On the whole the evidence in regard to the production of teachers was depressing.
A few men will always deliberately choose teaching as a profession, but in general, after the Government, the universities, and: industry have taken their toll of the biologists, the margin left for teaching in the schools is small- a fact which must react unfavourably on the future qualitative output of biologists.26. It is now our business to consider the obstacles standing in the way of obtaining biologists for work in this country and overseas, and to formulate our proposals for the removal of such obstacles. Broading speaking, these obstacles may be looked at from two points of view : (1) deficiencies in the Appeal  men do not offer themselves; (2) deficiencies in intellectual equip-ment men who offer themselves are deficient in intellectual quality or equipment.(a) The Appeal of a Biological Career.27. At the present time there is a demand for biological workers in Government services, both at home and abroad, in industry, and in teaching, and yet, despite this demand, and despite the fact that in every other profession calling for a certain high standard of educational attainment there appears to be a congested list of appli-cants clamouring to be admitted, in this particular field of employ-ment there seems to be a very general ignorance of the opportunities of employment which exist, and men are not coming forward. Why?&apos;(i) The Home Services.28. It appears from the evidence that, even for the supply of home needs, no machinery exists for placing before potential candidates, their parents, and the schools any comprehensive state-ment of the various classes of biological posts under the Government likely to be vacant at any given date, of the assured salaries offered, or of the prospects of advancement. This is also true in regard to appointments open to chemists and physicists, but, in the case of these professions, the public generally are familiar with the financial advantages offered. As regards agricultural research, the English and Scottish Departments of Agriculture co-operate-with the Development Commission in a joint scheme for the provision of post-graduate scholarships, but with this exception there appears to be a complete lack of any plan for common action, Departments taking such steps as in their judgment are appropriate or convenient to acquaint the university authorities and the public with their probable requirements. We believe that this lack of co-ordination among the Departments employing biologists in this country very seriously affects the supply of biologists.(ii) The Dominions and India.29. Erom the information obtained at our request (see para-graph 4) by the Dominions Office and the India Office, it appears-that the Dominion Governments and the Government of India hope in the main to be able in the future to obtain the biologists they require from candidates trained in the Dominions and in India. At the present time, they still recruit a certain number of biologists, from this country, and to this extent they draw on the pool of biologists but apparently will do so less and less in future.(iii) The Colonial Empire.30. Turning to the recruitment of biologists for service in the-Colonial Empire, we find the situation beset with special difficulties. Various classes of biological workers are recruited from time to-time on behalf of the Colonies, Protectorates, and Mandated Terri-tories. Appointments are made whenever vacancies occur or local circumstances point to the desirability of some special investiga-tion, although in recent years the introduction of the scholarship-
systems (paragraphs 84, 93, and 98) has made it possible to con-concentrate the bulk of the normal appointments to the biological services in the Colonies within the summer months. The requirements of the Colonial Governments are notified to the Colonial Office, and the personnel are recruited through a special Appointments Department, which within the last year has taken over the functions formerly discharged by the Private Secretary (Appointments) of that Office. The Colonial Empire is by far the largest employer of biologists under the Crown, and large additions to biological staffs have been made in recent years. The officers appointed belong, however, to the particular Govern-ment for service in whose territory they are recruited, and are paid, not on a uniform scale, but at whatever rate is in force in the particular territory to which they are assigned. Naturally no one Colonial Government is able to state even approximately its probable requirements for officers of this class for a period of years ahead. On the other hand, the absence of any assurance as to the number of vacancies in any given year, and the lack of uniformity in the terms of service offered, act as powerful deterrents to young men contemplating biology as a career; to the training of biologists at the universities; and also to the diversion at an early stage of young men of scientific aptitude from other and over-crowded branches of physical or natural science. We were greatly impressed by the evidence tendered by the Colonial Office repre-sentatives, in regard to the difficulties which the present system places in the way of recruiting the highest class of biological workers. We accept the view put forward that those difficulties would be largely reduced if the biologists employed in the Colonial Empire formed part of unified services. If such services existed, it would be possible for the Secretary of State for the Colonies to give some assurance to the public and to the universities and schools of at least the minimum requirements of the Colonies for biologists. Tutors and directors of studies at the universities would then be in a position to advise undergraduates studying biological subjects (or even other branches of science) that if they obtained a sufficiently high class or an adequate training they would have a definite chance of obtaining one of a given number of posts.31. We contrast this state of things with the system which prevails in the Home and Indian Civil Services. In the case of these services, parents, boys, schools and universities all know that each year a considerable number of appointments will be made; that at a date approximately constant from year to year selection will be made ; and plans are laid accordingly, even from the earliest years, for boys to offer themselves for these careers.32. We are confident that, if this same certainty could be introduced into the domain of Colonial appointments, the supply of fit candidates would greatly increase. We are fully aware that this result could not be obtained by a stroke of the pen, either to-day or to-morrow; much will have to be done in the direction of building up a permanent system on which parents and candidates can rely. The services will have to be unified; some arrangement will have to be made whereby the recruiting policy of the Service taken as a whole will be made more stable from year to year. We do not suggest the substitution by the Colonial Office of examination for selection, but we do think it important that the principles on which selection is made should be simple and easily understood. If selection were so organised, it would be easier for the Colonial Office to guarantee at least a minimum number of vacancies per annum and to concentrate the selection of candidates for the greater number of such vacancies at a recognised date in each year. But all these things have been recommended by a series of Committees and Commissions. They are in principle agreed, and we understand that the Colonial Office is gradually working out concrete schemes.88. We are convinced therefore that the first obstacle to be overcome is uncertainty uncertainty regarding the date and principles of selection and regarding conditions of service, pay, and pensions. The second main obstacle is to be found in the financially unattractive character of the careers held out to the biologist in the[22409] &apos;  a
JOColonial Service. It may be said of scientists generally, mat there are many who look to the work to be done as the main incentive to -adopt a career in science, and show a remarkable indifference to worldly rewards. All honour to them! But it is a reasonable -demand on the part of the majority that, when they are considering a life career, they should see an attractive pecuniary recompense during the period of their working life, and the prospect of an adequate pension on retirement. It would go far to emphasise the attractiveness of the career offered to biologists if the conditions of service and scales of pay were uniform throughout the various Colonies and Dependencies and if it were understood that promotion to high administrative posts, even to that of Governor, was not -debarred to them. As matters stand, we have it on high authority that boys of high promise and distinction are advised not to take up biological careers.34. If these two main obstacles uncertainty as to the career offered by biology and lack of attractiveness in conditions of service in the various parts of the Colonial Empire were overcome, we believe that everything would fall into its place. The process will be one of normal and natural development, by which the supply will gradually in quantity and quality approximate to the demand ; and this has its important aspect, for it is, in our opinion, essential not to stimulate a supply beyond the requirements of the situation. Nothing would tend more to give a set-back to the supply than the over-production of a large body of suitable candidates for whom appointments could not be found. We have reason to believe that, as the result of the importance of chemistry during the war and of the development of the chemical industries in the years immediately following, the public were led to think that there was an almost unlimited demand for chemists with the result that for a time some such over-production as we deprecate took place.35. There remains a further obstacle, applying more particularly to recruitment for service overseas, to which&apos; we must allude because many witnesses have laid stress upon it, though here we can suggest no solution. We refer to the small families which are a marked feature of this age, and the consequent disinclination of parents to encourage their sons to seek their fortunes overseas. It has been said that the Empire has been built up by its younger sons; now there are, figuratively speaking, no younger sons.36. Finally, public opinion has itself been responsible, in part, for the slow recognition of biology. The public will follow -everything which appears to have &quot;money&quot; in it. They see money and careers for their sons in the application of chemistry and physics to industry, hence the rush of students to these branches of science. Since public attention has been drawn recently to careers in and through biology, there has been an awakened interest in the possibility of a career in this direction. Apart then from what we hope will result from the more general recognition of biology in the school curriculum to which we refer later (paragraph 61), we believe that public opinion, once interested, will stimulate the -supply.^7. In general, what we have to overcome is an attitude of mind. Once it is accepted that there are careers in biology, the public will turn their attention to the opportunities offered for their hoys, and parents will see to it that the schools provide the instruction; once the schools give the proper position to biology in &quot;the curriculum, boys will begin to become interested, and the attractions of careers offered by biology will be weighed against those offered by the classics, languages, history, and chemistry and physics. Though we cannot hope to increase the number of first-class brains by introducing biology as a subject of study, yet it may be that here and there a boy of first-class powers, but unused, may have his interest awakened for the first time and be stimulated by this new subject to put his powers to this fresh use; or that the classic, the historian, the chemist or physicist may experience from
biology a pull which he had hitherto failed to receive from his special subject. The world is made up of all sorts and biology is fortunate in being able to provide careers for great diversities of aptitude and attainment.(b) Deficiencies in Intellectual Equipment.38. We have said above that our evidence indicates that the supply of candidates, even when it is sufficient in quantity, is lacking in quality. If this only meant that, candidates being few, the good are fewer still, it would be a mere truism, but, as most witnesses put it forward, it means more, viz., that even in proportion to the number of candidates the number of good ones is less than in the case of other professions; in short, that biology tends to get the leavings after other demands are satisfied. Put in this naked form, the statement may be exaggerated, but in so far as it is true the cause is obvious enough; too few boys, especially too few of the ablest, proceed to, or emerge from, the universities with their minds still open to biology.   The reasons again for this are clear.39. Biology, as a subject of study in the schools, has come late into the field.   To quote one of our witnesses : &apos;&apos; The reason for the specific neglect of biology is simple; it is a historical one that, when the struggle for the recognition of sciences in the school curriculum was taking place, biology was not yet ripe, but physics and chemistry were.&quot;40. We believe this account of the late arrival of biology as a possible subject of study in the schools to be substantially correct; and from this fact followed certain consequences, which we shall now enumerate : (i) First, the curricula of the schools were arranged with no place left for the study of biology.(ii) As a consequence, there was no demand for biology masters, nor any equipment furnished for biological instruction.(iii) A place for science in the time-table was allotted tochemistry and physics and, if such an expression may be permitted, these sciences &apos;&apos; dug themselves in.&apos;&apos;(iv) Lastly, there was no field of employment for the biologistsufficient to stimulate a study which had not yet come to be regarded as an indispensable cultural element in the scheme of education.41. As a consequence, it would be broadly true to say that in. the universities : (i) Science scholarships, while open to all scientific subjects, have, in the main, been awarded on chemistry and physics, because the bulk of the candidates from the schools offered themselves for examination in these subjects.hi) The pressure of the keen competition has led to a progres-sive rise in the standard of the papers set to the candidates in chemistry and physics.(iii) After he has obtained his scholarship the scholar has, as a general rule, continued his studies leading to a degree in those subjects in which he has already won distinction at school and in the scholarship examination.42. The factors indicated in the preceding paragraphs (para-graphs 40 and 41) acting concurrently have resulted in excessive specialisation on the part of the schools in the preparation in chemistry and physics of their candidates for science scholarships. This has helped to crowd biology out as a subject for examination. We deal with this difficult problem later in our Report (para-graphs 51 to 58).[22409]
IY__THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS ANDTHE PROBLEM OF THE SUPPLY OF TEACHERS.(a) The Teaohing of Biology in the Schools.(i) England and Wales.43. The evidence with regard to the schools bears out the conclusions we have adumbrated above (see Appendix II, Note 3).k According to information furnished to us by the Board of Educa-tion, of the grant-aided boys&apos; secondary schools in 1927-28 only about one in ten included biological teaching in the curriculum. In the non-grant-aided secondary schools there has been, we believe, a marked increase in the biological teaching during the last five years, but we doubt whether biology can be said to be established as a cultural subject in more than a fraction of the schools.44. The Beport of the Imperial Agricultural Besearch Conference, 1927, paragraph 68, stresses the inadequacy of biological teaching in the schools in the following words: &quot;&apos; For some years past the strong tendency among science students towards reading chemistry, physics and mathematics, with no biological subjects, has occasioned grave concern in the biological schools of the universities. The root of the difficulty lies in school education. In comparison with chemistry and physics, biology is difficult to teach at school. .... Competent masters are few; and &apos; cramming&apos; for university entrance scholarships offers greater difficulty in biology than in the physical sciences.   In every level and typeof school education the facts are apparent.....   One andall testify in their curricula to the inadequate provision for biological teaching.&quot;45. We note also that in a Beport issued by the Board of Education in 1925, and reprinted in 1927, there is a passage to the following effect: &quot; The Beport of the Prime Minister&apos;s Committee on Science, 1918, emphasised the need for science teachers with a wider outlook; it also urged the desirability of some elemen-tary teaching of biology as a part of the normal curriculumin boys&apos; schools.....   Very little has been done to giveeffect to the recommendations of the 1918 Committee.....This is partly due to the specialised character of the Degree Courses pursued by the teachers at the universities.&quot;There follows a description of the courses, and then the Beport goes on : &apos;&apos; This being the general character of the Degree Courses few teachers are found who have interested themselves in sciences other than physics and chemistry which they learntat school and studied at the universities.....   It wouldprobably assist matters if boys were more generally encouraged to take botany or biology at the Advanced Course stage; but the difficulty is to find teachers of biology for boys&apos; schools. In this matter we are in a vicious circle.&quot;46. The evidence which we have received tends to confirm the opinions expressed in these reviews, but there are hopeful signs that an improvement in the situation is already taking place. We have been told by the Board of Education that there has been an increase in the number of men teachers of science seeking admis-sion to the Board of Education&apos;s short courses on biology; that the* These statistics refer mainly to the number of students taking the School Certificate examination. The numbers of such students does not form a real criterion either of the amount of biology taught in the schools or of its quality, since many schools, especially the non-grant-aided ones, do not offer for this examination all the subjects that find a place in their curriculum. From the point of view of our inquiry these figures should therefore be used with reserve.
increase in the number of boys already definitely thinking of biology as a career (see Appendix II, Note 4) affords a still more striking illustration; and that there is abundant reason to believe that headmasters are now alive to the situation, as is evidenced by the fact that in many schools special laboratories for biology are being provided.47. It has been represented to us that prospective biologists are at a disadvantage owing to the small number of scholarships awarded to the subject, and that an allocation of scholarships to biology at the universities would prove an incentive to the study of biology at school. We would not, in any case, look with favour on scholarships earmarked to a special branch of science, but the suggestion rests on ignorance of the facts, for we gather from the evidence that scholarships as a rule are offered in science subjects generally, and that biologists have their chance in competition with chemists and physicists. The marked numerical predominance of candidates in chemistry and physics naturally results in a majority of the scholarships being awarded to those branches of science, but this does not of itself involve any injustice to biology, and, indeed, it would appear from the evidence that biologists, in proportion to the number of biologist candidates, do not fare badly. But even in regard to these we have no evidence to show what percentage will go to the pool of biologists and what to medicine.48. But this raises the general question of scholarship examina-tions and awards at Oxford and Cambridge. Our evidence (see Appendix II, Note 5) on this point has been so full and emphatic that we feel bound to go into the question in some detail.49. These scholarships are awarded, not by the universities, but by the Colleges. They do not now cover the whole ground but they occupy a dominating position if only because competition for them existed long before other scholarships or even the bodies that now award them came into existence. The ideals suggested by them had laid hold of the older schools and fixed the general character of Vlth Form work. At first the newer universities awarded such scholarships as they had on different lines, but, as they and the schools most closely connected with them developed, there has been a steady approximation to the Oxford and Cambridge ideals. When the Higher Certificate Examination was set up on which many scholarships are now&apos; awarded, part of the purpose of the Board of Education in its suggestions to the examining bodies was on the one hand to counteract what was regarded as the excessive specialisations-tion of Oxford and Cambridge and on the other to help the younger schools towards specialisation, but of a more moderate kind. These objects were not realised. At Oxford and Cambridge it was found impossible directly to approach the Colleges. In the younger schools the Higher Certificate Examination succeeded at first in establishing a moderate degree of specialisation, but this led later to over-specialisation because the pull of the College scholarship system was so strong and because it was found impracticable to have two divergent aims in the same school. There has therefore been a steady pressure towards increasing specialisation in the Higher Certificate Examination. Thus all schools and all universities have been drawn into the one net. If the net is to be broken, it is with the Colleges that negotiation is required and it is just with the Colleges that negotiation is most difficult, if only because they are so numerous, and each of them is an independent authority responsible to no one. The newer universities have examining boards with which negotiation is easy; Oxford and Cambridge also have an examining board, but this cannot speak or act for the Colleges and has no concern with the award of College scholarships. Accordingly, in the immediately ensuing paragraphs, we deal explicitly with scholarships awarded by the Oxford and Cambridge Colleges.50. In an earlier paragraph we pointed out that the late arrival of biology as a subject of instruction led to the establishment of a monopoly of place in the curriculum for chemistry and physics. Scholarships in science thus became, in fact, scholarships for chemistry and/or physics.   The very large development of instruc-
tion in these subjects in grant-aided schools, which themselves, owing to the Education Act of 1902, had greatly increased in number, led to a great accession of candidates for scholarships in chemistry and/or physics. The competition became very severe, the standard of attainment among the candidates was enhanced, and the standard of difficulty of the examination papers rose.51. This standard of attainment could be reached only by specialisation, that is, by concentration on the subjects of chemistry and physics, and it has been seriously impressed upon us that this specialisation has resulted in undue or excessive concentration on these subjects to the subordination or exclusion of other subjects of equal educational value, which has been greatly prejudicial to the educational interests of the young science student. We should equally deprecate this specialisation if biology were added as a subject.52. The argument, as it has been placed before us by witnesses, may be stated as follows : The general allegation that the present system leads to an excessive degree of specialisation in the schools may be divided into two heads : (1) Among boys taking science as their special line of study there is too great concentration on &quot; science &quot; to the neglect of other subjects. Our witnesses view with anxiety the prospect of a growing race of illiterate scientists unable to express themselves adequately or intelligently in their own language, and ignorant alike of history and of the forces other than the chemical and physical which make the world in which they live.&apos;*2) Inside &quot; science &quot; itself there is an excessive concentration on certain subjects and this concentration creates an increasingly false interpretation of science as a whole, which becomes identified with two branches, viz., physics and chemistry.There are two further criticisms, viz., (1) that in physics and chemistry the questions set are frequently unsuitable for school work, as regards either subject-matter or degree of difficulty; and (2) that there is a tendency to treat zoology and botany as separate subjects rather than as component parts of the science of life, as defined in paragraph 15 antea.58. The problem set out above arises from the concurrence of two facts, one universal, the other peculiar to this country.(a) The immense development of knowledge makes &quot; specialisations-tion &quot; inevitable; for anyone who is to reach a high level of competence in any direction.(t)) In England alone, of all countries, the curriculum of schools is largely controlled by the scholarship system, but for which many boys would not be able to proceed to the university at all.54. The Colleges, therefore, at Oxford and Cambridge, which award these scholarships have control. But it is not direct control ; if it were if the Colleges were directly responsible for curriculum and time-table they would, no doubt, consider the matter broadly and discourage a one-sided education. But the control is indirect, through an external examination only, and schools are almost bound to take whatever seems the best course towards winning these prizes.55. Again, the scholarship examinations appear to be directed, as is only natural, to discovering those boys who give promise of doing well in the same field of subjects in the subsequent university examinations. In recent years it is true that most Colleges have added to the special subject papers others of a more general character, but unfortunately we find a widespread disbelief that good work in these papers carries any weight with the examiners, and, while the stronger schools may, and in some cases do, see to it that the general education of scholarship candidates is carried on, in others there is still far too much concentration on a narrow field.
56. We have now to consider the reactions or the system n the teaching of biology. The root fact, as we have seen, is that for generations the competition, chus held in a narrow field, has, broadly, had two results : (1) In the schools, boys are allowed to restrict their work accordingly.(2) The standard reached by the better boys becomes unduly high within their chosen field, while more modest work in a wider field is undervalued.57. Any new subject has to establish itself in the face of this tradition; it will not be regarded as of scholarship level unless the standard attained in it is comparable with that of established subjects, i.e., has a comparable relation to the final university standard. This puts the candidate who offers biology in a difficulty. If he is to do his ultimate work properly, i.e., become a competent biologist, he must have at least a grounding in physics and a sound knowledge of chemistry; if to these he is obliged to add a consider-able acquaintance with biology, he clearly cannot approach the exist-ing scholarship standard in physics and chemistry, especially&apos; if biology means two subjects, zoology and botany; conversely, unless be unduly neglects the physical sciences he cannot reach in his own special biological subjects a standard closely comparable with that reached by the physicists and chemists in theirs.58. It seems to follow that a scholarship examination on which biologists are to be selected must, if its influence is to be healthy, pay due attention to physics and chemistry as well as to biology, but with&apos; full recognition that the standard in every branch must be definitely lower than that now attained in physics and chemistry scholarships. We should add that there is a general agreement on the part of witnesses competent to express an opinion that the present standard of scholarship examinations in biology is sufficiently high, and they view with apprehension a possible rise in the standard (consequent on premature specialisations-tion) comparable with that which has taken place in the case of chemistry and physics.59. An interesting fact emerged during our inquiry, which throws light on the effect of the undue specialisation which we have described above, and adds point to our criticism. It is generally agreed that a competent knowledge of one modern language (French or German, the latter in particular) is, quite apart from its cultural value, an essential element in the equipment of the adequately trained scientist. It was pointed out, for example, that during the university stage teachers sometimes find it necessary to translate to their pupils passages in German or French periodicals and text-books which the pupils ought to be able to read in the originals for themselves.60. We have good reason for thinking that teachers of science in the schools and in the universities desire to see the removal of this serious deficiency in the training of the young scientist. The remedy that we suggest is simple and would, we believe, be effective. If, in the award of science scholarships or the entrance test for the Faculties of Science, it was agreed that a competent knowledge of one modern language (German by preference) was essential, and that proficiency in it would be a serious element alike in the award of the scholarship and in the conditions of entry for the Faculty, the curriculum and time-table in the schools would automatically adapt themselves to provide the required proficiency. Similarly, at the universities, proficiency in at least one modern language should, we suggest, be placed on the same basis in the first or second preliminary year of the university course as proficiency in the principal branches of physical or natural science. That such proficiency can be acquired without injury (rather indeed with positive benefit) to the purely scientific work, is proved by the experience of some of the Scottish Universities and most, if not all, of the English Provincial Universities where a knowledge of at least one modern language has for some years been required toy  the Faculties of Science.    We  urge,  therefore, that the
authorities in the schools and the universities should be pressed to co-operate in securing a solution of this difficulty, on the lines suggested above.61. So far we have considered the teaching of biology mainly from the point of view of the scholarship system, but (while it is true that the curriculum of the schools is influenced by that system) the ordinary school-boy requires consideration equally with the scholarship candidate. We hold strongly that no boy should leave school without having been introduced to biology, and that, therefore, the time-table should be so adjusted that biology, as a cultural subject, should find a place in the curriculum of every secondary school.62. Before passing on to consider the position at the universities there is one matter to which we must make reference. It has been represented to us that the medical first M.B. examination, which is now in the case of some universities to be taken at school, has exercised a prejudicial effect on the general instruction in biology given to boys other than those destined for a medical career. While this view has obtained support from some witnesses, others have held that, provided the schedules of these examinations are handled properly, they serve as a useful introduction to biology, giving an admirable frame-work of zoology and botany and ensuring that neither was entirely neglected. We find, however, that there is great variation in the range and form of the schedules laid down for this examination by the various universities, and this lack of uniformity is, we fully recognise, a source of great embarrassment to the schools.68. It is impossible, in considering biological studies in schools, to ignore the pursuit of Natural History and the existence of School Natural History Societies. &quot; Natural History &quot; in this sense ranges in meaning and value from the unsystematic collection of birds&apos; eggs and butterflies to a most valuable training in the observation of nature. We attach great importance to it, for we regard this pursuit, however humble, in character and method, as an indispensable adjunct to systematised instruction in biology. But we attach importance to its voluntary character. We should deprecate any attempt to make it part of a regimented course of school instruction and it certainly should not be a subject of examination. We feel sure that the association of a master in a voluntary capacity greatly enhances the value of a school Natural History Society, and these Societies should be encouraged, especially in our urban schools. The cult of the hedgerow and the village pond through such Societies should serve as a most valuable introduction to the field work of the trained biologist. We need not add that advanced &apos;&apos; Natural History&apos;&apos; of the type referred to in paragraph 19 is quite unsuitable for schools, since it requires a high degree of specialisation and involves a difficult technique.(ii) Scotland.64. The great majority of secondary schools in Scotland are in receipt of grant aid and, in consequence, are engaged in preparing pupils for the Leaving Certificate of the Scottish Education Department. This certificate is accepted under certain conditions by the Scottish Universities Entrance Board and may be regarded as the normal passport of entry to the Scottish Universities. On the evidence we are satisfied that the Scottish Education Department takes a generous view as to the subjects which may be presented for the Leaving Certificate and regards sympathetically the inclusion of biology in the school curriculum. The regulations of the Department, in fact, interpose no obstacle to the study of biology or to the recognition of the subject in the Leaving Certificate.65. Few schools are provided with teaching facilities for bio-logical study, and this is reflected in the small number of candidates in such subjects presented for the Leaving Certificate or other qualification admitting to the universities. The cost of providing the accommodation and equipment required for biology is less than
in the case of chemistry and physics, but considerable expenditure would be necessary to provide the corresponding teachers. As matters stand, financial considerations frequently force schools to adopt either chemistry and physics or &apos;&apos; Natural Science &apos;&apos; (which sometimes is the combination of botany and geography). There can be little change in the situation unless the schools find it possible to include some biological teaching, not as an option to chemistry and physics, but as a cultural study complementary to these subjects and in no sense competitive with them.66. We have examined the degree curricula of the Scottish Universities and find that science graduates fall into two classes : (o) those who have specialised in chemistry, physics, and mathematics and have studied a biological subject up to the pass standard, (b) those who have specialised in biology and have studied physics and chemistry to the pass standard. For this reason the difficulty experienced in England in finding teachers qualified to teach more than a limited number of sciences ought not to exist to the same, extent in Scotland.67. We recognise that in Scotland, as in England, the difficulty which must always confront schools in attempting to provide instruction in biology in addition to courses in physics and chemistry is to find the necessary place in the time-table. In so far as they succeed in doing so, they tend to counteract the dangers of excessive specialisation in any one group of scientific studies to which we have referred when dealing with the teaching of biology in England (paragraphs 50 to 58).(b) The Problem of the Supply of Teachers.68. The problem of the supply of teachers for the schools gives grave cause for anxiety, for it is obvious that, unless there are those who are competent to teach biology in the schools, it is impossible to create the pool of biologists out of which the biological services are to be maintained. In paragraph 25, we have stated that after the Government, industry, and the universities have taken their toll of the biologists, there is left only a small margin to teach in the schools. In paragraph 61 we lay emphasis on our view that the introduction of biology into the curriculum of the schools as a general cultural subject is essential, and that in this matter the ordinary boy requires consideration equally with the scholarship candidate. From this it follows, in our opinion, that what is wanted in the schools is not only science teachers who have taken honours in biology at the university as their principal subject, to whom will fall the task of dealing with the specialised instruction in biology, but others who, in addition to any other subject that they are specially qualified to teach, are competent to introduce students, other than biological specialists, to biology as a cultural subject. In paragraph 71 we make a recommendation that a candidate for an Honours science degree at a university should by the regulations of the university be compelled to show some knowledge of a biological subject. If the universities were to adopt this sugges-tion, we believe that it would go far to supply the type of science teacher which is required.Y. THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSITIES.(a) England and Wales.69. The universities present us with a completely different problem. It is no longer a question of lack of facilities, lack of teachers, or the difficulty of finding a place for biology in the curriculum. No one has suggested that the biological sciences cannot be studied; that there are no eminent Professors and teachers in biology at hand to impart instruction; or that the statutes and regulations do not admit of the student in biology following his bent. Details regarding the facilities for the teaching of biology  at  Oxford  and  Cambridge,  at  London  University,[22409] d
In thf English Provincial Um;&apos;ersities, in the University of Wales, and in the Scottish Universities are given in Appendix III. We deal with the subject of post-graduate work later in our Eeport (Section VI).70. The difficulty at the university lies in a tendency, to which we have alluded above, on the part of the student to follow along the groove of the sciences in which he has already attained distinc-tion at school or in the scholarship examination. We have already indicated the predominance of chemistry and physics in the school curriculum; the student wins his scholarship in those subjects; and at the universities (and we take the University of Cambridge for this purpose as our example) he can, owing to the introduction of mathematics into the Part I Tripos, proceed to take an Honours degree in physics, chemistry, and mathematics without touching any biology* (see also Appendix II, Note 6).71. It is impossible to blame the student who wishes to get his first-class, and we can understand the attitude of the tutor who is reluctant to advise his pupil to take up a fresh subject. We are, however, concerned to point out that there is a very real obstacle in this practice to the study of the biological sciences and, if we may continue to use our Cambridge example, Wc would urge that students working for Part I of the Natural Sciences Tripos should be compelled to show some knowledge of a biological subject, and we would suggest a corresponding amendment of the regula-tions at other universities where the same situation prevails. We are confident that such action on the part of the universities would have far-reaching consequences and would act as a most potent stimulus to the study of biology.72. In considering the position of the schools in relation to the requirements of the universities, we have already expressed the view (paragraphs 59, 60), that over-specialisation is mainly responsible for the inadequate acquaintance with modern languages of many of the boys entering the universities with the intention of taking an Honours degree course in science. We are, therefore, faced not with a problem peculiar to biology, but with one of general interest to the teachers of all branches of science both in the schools and at the universities. Its solution can only be found through joint action to ensure that science students, both at school and at the universities, should be required to show a knowledge sufficient to enable them without difficulty at least to understand technical papers on their special subject written in German and Prench.78. Such insistence on a knowledge of modern languages would have a double advantage. It would afford to the science student opportunities for a much wider study of his special subject than is possible so long as he can only consult works written in his own language. It would also go far to remove the dangers of premature and excessive specialisation on science by substantially increasing the cultural element in school education.(b) Scotland.74. The situation in Scotland presents many similarities with that in England and Wales in that the number of students reading for degrees in biological subjects is relatively small and has remained largely stationary during a period when the numbers attending the universities have greatly increased. Although the factors which contribute to this result in England are doubtless operative also  in   Scotland,   their  effect  is  less  pronounced.    To  take* See the article on &quot; Biology in Education and Human Life &quot; by Professor A. V. Hill, F.K.S., published in the supplement to Nature on the 3rd January, 1931, and in particular the following passage :-&quot;It is possible in the University of Cambridge to obtain an honours degree in science by taking the Natural Sciences Tripos and studying only physics, chemistry and mathematics. It would be equally possible to take three biological subjects, hut those would necessitate at least a certain knowledge of chemistry and physics. No man or woman, I feel, should be able to go out of this place with the hall-mark of a scientist who has not taken, her&apos;) or at school, some course in general biology.&quot;
an example, the influence of scholarship examinations of the type to which reference is made in paragraph 49 can be largely discounted as the traditional bursary competition of the Scottish Universities is essentially designed to test the standing of candidates in four or five basic subjects, awards for exceptional achievement or promise in a single subject being relatively few in number. The. danger of extreme specialisation in a single subject at the school stage is therefore in large measure avoided.75. Although biological subjects are recognised in the bursary competitions of the Scottish Universities, the number of students who select these subjects rarely exceeds six per cent, of the total. This selection depends on whether biology has been studied as a school subject, and it has an important effect in determining the subsequent course of study leading to a degree. In the Scottish Universities, as elsewhere, students usually continue the studies which they have commenced at school.76. The facilities provided by the Scottish Universities for the study of biology are good and the curricula for the degree of B.Sc. are framed on principles which commend themselves to us. Selecting a typical case, candidates must take four sciences on the Pass standard and, of these, chemistry and physics are compulsory. The regulations are framed in such a manner that the student of physics, chemistry, and mathematics must include one biological subject (alternatively in some cases geology or geography) and no student of biology can escape chemistry and physics.77. On completion of the general scientific course outlined in the preceding paragraph, two cognate sciences already studied are continued for a third year, at the conclusion of which the student presents himself for the ordinary degree. Candidates reading for Honours devote a fourth year to the specialised study of one of the subjects already selected, but before entering on the final year they must have completed a two years&apos; course in literary and &quot;scientific&quot; German. It has not been found necessary to make separate regulations for the study of French as practically without exception all science students have acquired a knowledge of this language before entering the university. These regulations fulfil many of the conditions which, on the evidence, are desirable in the training of biologists.78. The opportunities for further study at the disposal of students of the Scottish Universities are valuable. Graduates are fortunately placed in having access to the Research Scholarships of the Carnegie Trust; but an examination of the records shows that, although the research scheme of the Trust is generously conceived and includes biology on an equal footing with other sciences, the awards in biological subjects are few in number.79. In general, the conclusion that we draw from the evidence is that in Scotland few research scholarships are awarded to biolo-gists because there are few honours graduates in biology forth-coming from the universities that there are few graduates because there are few entrant students who take biology, and that there are few entrants because only a limited number of schools provide biology.YI. POST-GRADUATE  TRAINING IN BIOLOGY.(a) Training in Pure Science.80. In considering the question of post-graduate training in biology it is important to distinguish between the facilities available for students desiring to undertake pure research and those who desire to devote themselves to applied research. Departments requiring the services of biologists are naturally mainly preoccupied with the provision of adequate facilities for the post-graduate training for applied research, as it is this that forms the life work of the bulk of their biological staffs. The provision of facilities for post-graduate training in pure research is, however, at least as important. [22409] d 3
Ultimately, indeed, scientific progress depends on the studies of research workers whose interest is the advancement for its own sake of knowledge in their special field rather than the application of such knowledge to some immediate practical end. Pure science is the mother of applied science, and it is those who have had experience in systematic research work that are most likely to be able to bridge gaps in scientific knowledge.81. Through the various Departments responsible for the application of the physical and biological sciences to the life of the community, Government makes its contribution to the advancement of science. To the universities, to the Eoyal Society and to other learned associations of scientific men is rightly left the task they have so long fulfilled of ensuring that the growth of knowledge by disinterested work is not delayed or diverted from its course by the immediate calls of practical need. It is, however, open to Government to assist in such advancement of knowledge by pro-viding means for the training of men desiring to work in this field, and these facilities have been greatly increased in recent years. Biological subjects are included within the scheme administered by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research whereby maintenance grants are awarded to promising graduates to enable them to undertake a preliminary training in research (Appendix II, Note 7). At a later stage, the Senior Student-ships of the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners are available for those who justify further support. In addition, other awards, such as the Commonwealth Pund Fellowships, enable proved research workers to enlarge their experience. Graduates of the Scottish Universities are from this point of view in a specially favourable position owing to the generous; provision by the Carnegie Trust of research, scholarships and fellowships in all scientific subjects, including biology. From the evidence we have received it appears, however, that the number of applications for research awards received from graduates in biology is relatively small and that the number of applicants has remained almost stationary during a period when the corresponding demand by chemists and physicists has greatly increased, although it appears that a higher standard is demanded from such applicants than from biologists.82. It is probable that in biology, as in other branches of science, most of the students of the highest attainments who desire to take up pure research secure immediately after graduation appointments either in the universities or in research institutes. For the rest, we are satisfied that the existing provision for post-graduate training in biology, except in veterinary science, is ample and fails only in the numbers of recruits attracted to higher study and research.(b) Training in Applied Sciences.(i) The Agricultural Services.83. As regards agriculture, the present facilities for post-graduate training in biology are of recent growth, as it is only since the war, and more particularly during the last five years, that adequate funds have been available to enable post-graduates to undertake advanced training. These funds have, for the most part, been allocated to post-graduate scholarships, to which we refer in a later Section (Section VII).(a) The Scope of the Demand.84.   There are three main types of training sought by persons already possessing university degrees, namely :  (i) Immediate post-graduate training.(ii) Later training.(iii) Highly specialised training.Immediate post-graduate training following a degree course is designed to meet the needs of the holders of Government post-graduate scholarships.   The courses of post-graduate training of
this type vary according to the academic qualifications of the candidates by whom they are taken and the type of work which they propose ultimately to take up. Thus, for those who have taken a degree or diploma in agriculture and are in training for appointments as agricultural officers, the main requirement is an increase of scientific knowledge together with a thorough grounding in methods of field experimentation, with the requisite study of statistics. Those who have taken an Honours course in pure science and who propose ultimately to become agricultural officers either at home or abroad already possess a good foundation of pure science. The courses for such graduates are therefore mainly concerned with the application of science to agriculture and the practices of agriculture, though they require also to include field experimentation and statistics. Finally, there are those who, having taken an Honours degree in pure science, desire to become specialists in some branch of agricultural science. In their case the courses include a general training in agricultural practice and in the application of science to agriculture, together with advanced instruction in both the pure and the applied sides of their particular science. Thus, those specialising in entomology require facilities for specialised study of that subject. Similar facilities are required for those specialising in mycology, soil science, animal nutrition, animal physiology and genetics.85. Later post-graduate training is required by men who, having taken a university degree, have already spent some years in an agricultural service either in this country or abroad. At the present time many of those requiring such courses entered the agricultural service before the introduction of the existing facilities for post-graduate training. The course that they seek is, therefore, in effect, a &quot;refresher&quot; course. In addition, courses of a few weeks or a few months are often sought. These are of great value to a man already competent in research, who may profit very much from a short stay in a specialist laboratory. They are, however, of little or no value to persons not already possessed of a good grounding in science, the presence of whom at laboratories and institutions is often only a source of embarrassment.86. The requirements for highly specialised training are of a quite different character. Such training is sought by men who have been engaged for some years in some branch of agricultural science, such as entomology or mycology, and who desire to study the most modern methods in a particular aspect of it. For such men formal courses are not required, the essential need being accommodation in the laboratory of some distinguished worker in their field.(b) Existing Facilities.87. The existing facilities for post-graduate training in agriculture are provided almost solely by institutions financed for teaching and research by the Departments of Agriculture in this country and in Scotland. In most cases these institutions were originally designed only for research, but, with the concurrence of the Development Commission and of the Departments of Agriculture, their scope has, in many cases, gradually been enlarged to embrace post-graduate training. In this work these institutions have received ungrudging assistance from the schools of pure science in universities in advanced courses and in other ways.88. Immediate post-graduate training is provided at various centres, including the universities and research stations. Facilities for later training of the &apos;&apos; refresher &apos;&apos; course type are covered by the provisions for immediate post-graduate training. In some cases, however, persons taking such later training do not actually become members of the university to which they are attached. Supplementary post-graduate training in tropical agriculture is given to scholars and others at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad. This institution, being situated in the tropics, offers special advantages for the training of students in tropical agriculture and is rightly regarded as the centre for post-graduate training in this field for the Colonial Agricultural Service.
89. Highly specialised training is given in over forty institu-tions in this country. These are concerned with the application of one or more branches of science to agriculture. In some, teaching and research are united, in others research alone is pursued.90. It will be seen from the foregoing that there.exists in the United Kingdom a wide range of facilities for different kinds of post-graduate training in biology. Taken together, these facilities serve the requirements of this country and of the British territories overseas (see Appendix II, Note 8). The greater part of the income of the institutions where these facilities are provided comes from public funds, either from the Development Commission, through the Departments of Agriculture, or direct from the Empire Marketing Board.(c) Additional Facilities Required.91. From the evidence that we have received, we are satisfied that in the main the existing facilities for post-graduate training in agriculture, both on the scientific and on the practical side, are adequate and that no substantial changes will be required to meet the needs of the next decade. There are, however, a number of directions in which further development would be highly advantageous, e.g., the provision of adequate facilities for advanced formal teaching in soil science as apart from research. As we have explained, the existing agricultural institutions were not originally intended for post-graduate training, and, as the number of those under training increases, additional buildings and equipment are required and also some small additions to the scientific staff. These developments require a considerable expenditure, mainly for capital equipment, which could only be looked for over a long period of years. It may, however, be anticipated that, in the long run, economies will be secured by the centralisation of post-graduate training in the institutions best equipped for the purpose.92. The developments referred to in the preceding paragraph will require the closest attention in order to ensure that the development of post-graduate training does not interfere with the conduct of research, the main object for which the institutes were founded. For this reason, we welcome the announcement of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint an Agricultural Research Council, which we are hopeful will be able to secure an orderly development of both sides of the work of the institutes.(ii) Other Biological Services.93. The arrangements for post-graduate training in veterinary science in this country which cannot be regarded as satisfactory are discussed in a later Section of our Beport (paragraph 107). So far as regards the Colonial Service, a development in the right direction was made last year with the institution of a scholarship system. These scholarships are tenable for either one or two years in the case of students already possessing a veterinary qualification. Such students are attached while holding their scholarships to research institutes, e.g., the Institute of Animal Pathology, Cambridge, or the Animal Breeding Research Depart-ment, Edinburgh. Scholarships awarded to candidates who do not possess a veterinary qualification are tenable for a period of three or four years to enable the holders to qualify for the diploma of the Boyal College of Veterinary Surgeons at one or other of the Veterinary Colleges.94. Post-graduate training in forestry is highly centralised. Such training is sought almost exclusively by candidates who have received appointments to the forestry service in some part of the Empire. The course lasts for one year and is held at the Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford.
YII. METHODS OF OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF BIOLOGIST.95. We propose now to review the adequacy of the steps which have been taken to secure a supply of various classes of biologist. From our general review of the main divisions of biology (para-graphs 15-18) it will be seen that biological openings under Government range from administration, through many grades, to high specialisation. Broadly speaking, however, they may all be regarded as openings in applied biology. They all require, though in varying degrees, knowledge of the pure sciences, knowledge of the application of those sciences to some special field, e.g., agi-culture, animal health, &amp;c, and knowledge of the practices and economic circumstances of that field. The largest class in direct Government employment either in this country or overseas is what, for convenience, may be called the administrative class of biologist. In this term we include all members of the agricultural, forestry, and veterinary services other than specialists. In agriculture, and to a less extent in the forestry and veterinary services, two further categories may be distinguished, namely, the field specialist officer and the research station specialist officer. In addition there are a limited number of openings for biologists with specialist qualifications in fisheries research, food preservation-tion research, &amp;c. The museums also offer a special and restricted field for the employment of biologists. Finally, there are the openings for biologists in industry.(a) The Agricultural Services.(i) Agricultural Officers.96. In their Report (Stationery Office Publication 24-109 of 1928) the Imperial Agricultural Research Conference, 1927, defined (pages 20-21) the requirements for agricultural officers as follows : &apos;.&apos; Sound practical knowledge, a practical outlook, and administrative ability, constitute the first requirement. The acceptation of practical knowledge and outlook must not be narrow. An acquaintance with practice of a special or local form without an appreciation of the fundamentals of practice falls below the desired standard. Practice varies so widely between country and country, as, for instance, England with its plough and Nigeria with its hand implements, that only an understanding of fundamentals can give the agricultural officer that adaptability which success demands. National aspects, territorial policy and the economics of raising crops and stock are inseparable from his work. Knowledge and understanding in these things must, therefore, be counted an important requirement. Finally, scientific training is indispensable. It must be of such an order as will enable indeed impel the agricultural officer to regard the practices of his territory from a scientific point of view, to apply as fully as is practicable the established results of agricultural science, and to co-operate with his technical colleagues. Broadly, then, the standard is that of a University degree in agriculture suitably supplemented by post-graduate training.&quot;In thus defining this type of appointment the Conference naturally had colonial agriculture primarily in mind, but substantially the same qualities and qualifications are required for candidates seeking analogous appointments in this country, c.g., as county agricultural organisers, &amp;c.97. In order to meet the needs of Government, there are in existence a number of schemes by which scholarships are granted to university graduates who desire to enter the agricultural services either in this country or in the Colonial Empire overseas. Of these, the oldest is that started in 1911, wherein the Departments of Agriculture in this country and Scotland, with the help of funds
placed at their disposal by the Development Commission, were enabled to offer scholarships for research in the agricultural sciences. Of recent years the number of such scholarships granted has averaged about ten per annum. These scholarships were supplemented by two further schemes, started respectively in 1922 and 1924. Of these, the scheme started in 1924 consisted of a grant of general agricultural scholarships aiming at the training of candidates for posts as county agricultural organisers, lecturers in agriculture, &amp;c. In recent years the number of such scholarships granted has averaged about five per annum. Under the scheme started in 1922, scholarships were awarded to the sons and daughters of rural workers at school-leaving age. The value of the scholarships of this class varies, but is frequently sufficient to provide for a full degree course at a university followed by a post-graduate year. In recent years the number of such scholarships granted has averaged about twelve per annum.98. In 1920 the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation established a number of post-graduate studentships which aimed at giving advanced training, either in agriculture or in the agricultural sciences, to those likely to seek employment in cotton-growing countries. In recent years the number of such scholarships granted has averaged about eight per annum. In 1925, the Colonial Office instituted a scheme for the grant of agricultural scholarships for the training of men destined to become agricultural or specialist officers in the Colonial Agricultural Service. The latter must have an honours degree in pure science, and the former either an honours degree in pure science or an approved degree or diploma in agriculture. In recent years the number of such scholarships granted has averaged about twenty per annum. These scholarships are usually tenable for two years, of which one is normally required to be spent at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad.99. No guarantee of employment is given to the winners of the scholarships referred to in the preceding paragraphs, but, in fact, scholars who have pursued their post-graduate course satisfactorily have always found employment either in this country or overseas.(ii) Field Specialist Officers.100. In discussing the qualifications required for specialist appointments, the Imperial Agricultural Research Conference drew a distinction between the field specialist officer and the research station specialist officer (see their Report, page 20, paragraph 48); and the importance of this distinction has been clearly emphasised by the evidence that we have received. We accept as our own the following statement in the Report of the Conference (page 20) of the requirements for field specialists : &apos;&apos; A sound training in the pure sciences is essential for a specialist officer. While it would be unwise to specify suitable combinations of the sciences, it appears essential to insist on the importance of at least one biological subject. Even in this, rigidity must be avoided. Thus, a man who had read Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics at the University should not necessarily be debarred. It should be ensured, however, that in his post-graduate training prominence be given to the one or more biological subjects appropriate to the field of investigation he sought to enter. Broadly, then, a training in the pure sciences of University honours standard is the first requirement for the specialist officer. Only in very exceptional circumstances should this requirement be set aside.&quot; A knowledge of agriculture is also a requirement. It is a vital requirement. Perfunctory attendance at lectures and practical instruction in such measure as to ensure success in an examination is insufficient. For the specialist officer agri-cultural knowledge must be sufficient and of such a kind as to enable him to appreciate clearly the role of science in agricul-ture. It must generate in him an enthusiasm for &apos; practice with  science.&apos;    Thus,   for  instance,  the properly  equipped
mycologist should be able so to order his work as to render the territory for which he is responsible the best mycological service. He should be, not only the specialist investigator, but also the trusted mycological adviser of his Director of Agriculture/&apos;101. Officers of this class are recruited at the same time and in the same way as agricultural officers, and receive Colonial Office agricultural scholarships for post-graduate study. In addition, agricultural officers who have shown exceptional ability in the discharge of their duties are from time to time transferred to this class.(iii) Research Station Specialist Officers.102. In every branch of biological science certain researches inevitably become narrowed to a high specialisation. The problem, agricultural, veterinary, or whatever it may be, is thus merged into one or more of the pure sciences, and in this way the agricultural or veterinary specialist finds himself called upon to advance know-ledge in a pure science in order to meet his needs. For the very highly specialised scientists who alone can conduct research of this class, different qualities are required from those called for in the agricultural officer or in the field specialist officer. They have less need of the all-round qualifications required by agricultural officers, but, on the other hand, they must have far higher scientific attain-ments.103. In regard to this type of appointment, the Imperial Agricultural Besearch Conference observed (Beport, page 20, paragraph 48) : &apos;&apos; To couple refined science with sound appreciation of practice is not easy. The ideal standard which has been depicted must not be observed with such rigidity as to exclude altogether the very highly specialised scientist. Particularly in the new central research stations there will be increasing need for men of this type. That rare gift the flair for research must, if evident, be set at a high value.&quot;104. Posts of this class are only to be filled by men who have given proof of their capacity for research, and, though men of the highest ability will always be scarce, it may be assumed that, provided the general pool of biologists is itself adequate, there will be sufficient of them to fill the highest posts in the research laboratories in this country and overseas.(b) The Forestry Services.105. The great majority of openings in forestry for university candidates are in the various forestry services of the Empire. As a rule the Dominions select and train their own personnel, but South Africa recruits science graduates from her own universities and sends them to Great Britain for training in forestry. Australia and Canada send to the Imperial Forestry Institute, for special or advanced training, students who have already received their general training in their own Schools of Forestry. At the present time, the Colonial Office offers normally from ten to fifteen posts a year. The candidates for these posts are recruited from persons already possessing a university degree in forestry and, on selection, are in most eases sent to the Imperial Forestry Institute as probationers for one year. The Forestry Commission usually offers two or three posts each year. The candidates, who are required to possess a university degree in forestry, are also sent to the Imperial Forestry Institute for one year&apos;s further training. In addition, since 1927 there have been on the average four vacancies per annum in the Burma Forestry Service. In this case, the candidates are selected at the school-leaving age, and are required to graduate at the Oxford School of Forestry.[22409] b
106. We have not thought it necessary to deal in detail with the question of recruitment for the Forestry Services, as this question is, we are informed, under consideration by a Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Chairmanship of Sir James Irvine, one of our members.(o) The Yeteirinary Services.107. From the point of view of recruitment veterinary science makes a dual demand. On the one hand, there is the demand, -still substantial though apparently diminishing, for qualified veterinary surgeons for private practice in this country. On the other, veterinary science requires men in adequate numbers and of adequate quality for service at home and in the Colonial Empire. In order to deal adequately with recruitment and training, we have felt it necessary carefully to examine the general condition of veterinary science at home and in those Colonies the veterinary staffs of which are recruited from this country. We summarise our general conclu-flions on this subject as follows : (i) At no time in the past has adequate provision been made inthis country for teaching or research. Compared with the assistance given to other forms of applied science, British Governments have done very little to assist the develop-ment of veterinary&apos; science. In almost all other com-parable countries State aid has been afforded on a fat-more liberal scale than in Great Britain.(ii) For this and other reasons the advance of knowledge inveterinary science in this country compares unfavourably with that in the pure sciences and other applied sciences.(iii) At home and in the Colonies the industry of animal produc-tion has been, and remains, severely handicapped by deficiency of veterinary knowledge.(iv) Further, the neglect of research has done much to divertfrom veterinary science the able biologist by whom alone fundamental advances in veterinary knowledge can be made.(v) Hitherto, in teaching and, to a very large extent, in theorganisation of Government services almost the only provision made has been for one type of man, namely, the general veterinary officer.(vi) We recognise that in some eases it might be almost impos-sible to avoid laying a dual responsibility for routine practice and for research upon the general veterinary officer owing to the small size of the veterinary staffs. In other cases, however, this duality of duties has been due to the acceptance of the view that a general training in veterinary science is normally a sufficient foundation for research. This is not true in the case of medical research or research in other forms of applied science, and we believe it is equally untrue in the case of veterinary research.(vii) The status of veterinary science, both in the scientific world and in the public service, has in the past been low. More^ over, in comparison with other professions, emoluments have not been attractive when regard is paid to the fact that the training of the veterinary surgeon, without any later specialisation, occupies a period of four years, which is, shortly, to be increased to five.(viii) Very few recruits have come to veterinary science from theHonours science schools of the universities. One reason for this is that the neglect of veterinary science has deterred men of real ability from taking up this branch of science. Another is that such men are deterred from entering veterinary science on financial, if not other, grounds, by being required to undergo three years&apos; veterinary training after three or four years of an Honours degree course in science at a university.
(ix) For some years the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland have awarded post-graduate veterinary scholarships, but the flow of candidates has been poor.(x) As a natural result of these circumstances, particularly thosereferred to in (ii), (v), and (vi) above, the provision for post-graduate training in veterinary science cannot be compared with that existing for agricultural and other applied sciences.(xi) Professional training, he., normal courses for training inthe general field (for private practice and Government service), has been inadequately provided for and has lacked the vitalising associations that come from contact with pure science schools and with research.108. It would fall outside our province to make proposals for the general improvement of veterinary science in this country, but in respect of recruitment and training we feel bound to submit the following observations and suggestions : -(a) Veterinary instruction  should be closely  associated withresearch and with pure science as is instruction in other applied sciences.(b) There should be adequate provision for research.(c) It should be recognised alike in research institutes and inGovernment service that, as in other sciences, research should evolve by appropriate specialisation; and, further, that a general veterinary training is not the sole equip-ment for veterinary research.(d) While from among men of general training there mayoccasionally emerge a gifted research worker, veterinary science should look increasingly to Honours graduates in pure science for its research leaders.(e) To attract men from the pure sciences efforts should be madeto reduce the time required to be spent after graduation in gaining a general veterinary knowledge. In suggesting a reduction in this period we recognise the high import-ance of competent practical knowledge in the research worker.(/) Post-graduate scholarships are an important factor. The Departments of Agriculture in this country and in Scot-land have recently increased the emoluments of their scholarships and the Colonial Office has now instituted scholarships. It is of great advantage that these should be open both to science graduates and to men possessing a veterinary qualification.(g) Definite arrangements for post-graduate training in the specialised branches of veterinary science are urgently needed. It is probable that the most economical and generally most effective course would be to concentrate this at a single centre. It is not sufficient to attach a post-graduate student to a research centre. It is essential that he should work under the personal supervision of experienced teachers and undergo appropriate advanced instruction, in the form either of specially arranged courses or of those in university science schools.109. We believe that action on the foregoing lines would go far to secure a general improvement of the status of veterinary surgeons and of the scientific standard of veterinary science in this country. Animal production would benefit from advances in veterinary know-ledge and able recruits would be attracted.(d) Fisheries Research, Food Preservation Research, &amp;c.110. For fisheries and food preservation research, biologists with an all-round training are required. The demand is not great and the standard is high. That is to say, the best men who can be tempted by the salaries which are available are chosen. &apos;They are usually those who have graduated with first-class Honours in science and have had fairly good experience in research. The number required is not great; for fisheries, say two a year; for food research, up to the present, the same number.[22409] b 2
(e) Museum Services.111. From the evidence which we received from the witnesses who appeared before us on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), we are satisfied that the recruitment of museum personnel presents a special problem in itself. It is clearly of great advantage that taxonomists should possess a sound grounding in science. To many biologists museum work is, however, unattractive compared with the openings to be found in other branches of biological study at home and overseas. On the other hand, taxonomic work calls for other qualities than those that can be acquired by formal training in biology. In the past, there have been many leading systematists who possessed little or no biological training. Though workers of this type are likely to be less numerous in the future, it remains true that taxonomic work of the highest class is only likely to be done by men, whether qualified or not, to whom the subject offers special attractions. For this reason we think that, while museum authorities are well advised to recruit their staff as far as possible from persons possessing sound scientific training, there is much to be said for the policy adopted from time to time in the past of appointing to museum staffs systematic workers of proved ability, irrespective of their technical qualifications.112. Since 1918 the British Museum (Natural History) has, however, recruited less than two biologists per annum. Numerically, therefore, the requirements of museums for biologists are so slight as to have little or no effect on the general pool of biologists with which we are principally concerned in this Report.(f) Research in Industry.113. We have already expressed our view (paragraph 18) that, for the present and for some time to come, very highly specialised knowledge is required by only a few of the biologists who are likely to find employment in industry. Highly qualified specialists alone are capable of discovering new uses for biology in industry, but, once such discoveries have been made, their practical application is within the power of any competent biologist. For this reason, we think that the pool of biologists will probably be able to meet any calls that it is likely to receive on this account from industry.VIII. -RECOMMENDATIONS.114. The general policy that we recommend will, we believe, commend itself to all who have at heart the advancement of biology in this country. Its application will, however, call for the active goodwill and co-operation of the secondary schools, of the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and of the Faculties of Science at the various universities. It is idle to hope that the merits of the policy we advocate will of itself provide a driving force sufficiently strong to reconcile the points of view of the various interests affected. We feel, therefore, that, unless some definite action is taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, our recommendations may share the fate of those of previous commis-sions and committees; but this is not the only reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should intervene in this question. They are by far the largest employer of biologists in this country, and as such they are deeply interested in ensuring that the supply forthcoming is adequate. It is therefore highly desirable that they should be a party to the negotiations that will be required to give effect to our recommendations.115. No one Minister is, however, responsible for all the matters dealt with in our Report. Questions relating to the grant-aided secondary schools fall within the province of the President of the Board of Education so far as concerns England and Wales, and the Secretary of State for Scotland so far as concerns Scotland. No Minister has any direct official relations with the great secondary schools that receive no grants from public funds, or with the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge.    The
IX. SUMMARY   OF   CONCLUSIONS   AND RECOMMENDATIONS.(a) CONCLUSIONS.118. We submit for the consideration of the Economic Advisory Council the following summary of our principal conclusions : The Dimensions! of the Problem.(i) There is a substantial and growing demand from Government Departments for biologists for service in this/ country and in the Colonies, and there is a small but probably growing demand for biologists from concerns engaged in agricultural production overseas and in industry in this country.(ii) It is not possible to state this demand In precise arithmetical terms, but the supply of candidates for biological posts is not equal to the present demand, and even in those branches where the supply is sufficient in quantity it is deficient in quality. (Paragraphs 21 to 24.)(iii) The obstacles standing in the way of obtaining biologists may be looked at from two points of view(a) Deficiencies in the appeal men do not offer themselves.(b) Deficiencies in  intellectual   equipment men who  offerthemselves are deficient in intellectual quality or equip-ment.   (Paragraph 26.)universities, though for financial purposes in communication with the Treasury through the University Grants Committee, are not officially in contact with any Minister for the purpose of discussing such questions as those dealt with in our Beport.116. The Departments responsible for the application of research to agriculture, medicine, and industry are clearly deeply interested in securing an adequate supply of biologists to meet the needs of their special fields. Here again a number of Ministers are concerned. The Secretary of State for the Colonies is responsible for the supply of biologists of all kinds for the Colonies. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, responsi-bility in the case of agriculture is divided between the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland. For medical research, the Medical Besearch Council, for which the Lord President of the Council is responsible, is the body mainly concerned, though the question is naturally also of interest to the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland as head of the Department of Health for Scotland. For industrial research the Department concerned is the Department of Scientific and Industrial Besearch, for which the Lord President of the Council is also responsible. The Secretary of State for India is also concerned in this matter in so far as biologists are recruited or trained in this country for service in India.117. It is probable that this wide diffusion of responsibility is one of the main causes why so little effect has been given to the recommendations of previous inquiries. We feel convinced that if a real advance is to be secured it is essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should charge one of their members with the duty of bringing this Beport to the notice of all concerned with a view to securing agreement on a common plan of action. It was, we understand, upon the recommendation of the President of the Board of Education that our Committee was appointed, and we accordingly suggest that the Economic Advisory Council should recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the first instance, to invite the President of the Board of Education, in consultation with those of his Ministerial colleagues who are immediately concerned, to prepare for their consideration concrete plans for the initiation and conduct of the negotiations required to give effect to our Beport.
The Appeal of a Biological Career.(iv) The first main obstacle which has to be surmounted is the uncertainty in the matter of a career for biologists in the public service. This applies particularly to the reoruitment of biologists for service in the Colonial Empire. The absence of any assurance as to the number of vacancies in any given year and the lack of uniformity in the terms of service offered act as powerful deterrents to young men contemplating biology as a career (paragraph 30). If there existed for biologists the same certainty as for candidates for the Home and Indian Civil Services certainty that a considerable number of appointments would be made each year and at a date approximately constant from year to year we are satisfied that the supply of fit candidates would greatly increase. The present diffi-culties would be largely reduced if the biologists employed in the Colonial Empire formed part of unified services and the recruiting policy of the Service taken as a whole were made more stable from year to year.   (Paragraphs 30 to 32.)(y) The second main obstacle is to be found in the financially unattractive character of the careers held out to the biologists in the Colonial Service. The attractiveness of the careers offered to biologists would be greatly increased if the conditions of service and scales of pay were uniform throughout the various Colonies and Dependencies, and if it were understood that promotion to high administrative posts1 was not debarred to them.   (Paragraph 33.)(vi) If these two main obstacles were overcome, everything, so far as recruitment is concerned, would fall into its place. It would become generally known that there was a definite career open to those who had an adequate biological training, boys would lay them-selves out to prepare for it, and, as a consequence, the schools and universities would adapt their curricula to the new developments. (Paragraph 33.)Deficiencies in Intellectual Equipment.(vii) The third obstacle to the supply of biologists is due to the late arrival of biology in the field as a subject for study in the schools. The curricula of the schools were arranged with no place left in them for the study of biology, such place in the time table as was given to science being allotted to chemistry and physics. Further, until recently, the field of employment for the biologist has not been sufficient to stimulate a study which has not yet come to be regarded as an indispensable cultural element in the scheme of education in this country. As a result too few boys, especially too few of the ablest, have proceeded to, or emerged from, the universities with their minds still open to biology. Biology has, in short, tended to get the leavings: after the demands of other professions or of other branches of science have been satisfied.(viii) An adequate standard of intellectual equipment will not be obtained until biology is definitely recognised in the schools as a cultural subject apart from its value for medicine and for the professional biological services. Biology should be brought to the notice of every boy and none should leave school without some knowledge of it.   (Paragraphs 38 to 30.)Excessive Specialisation.(ix) The very large development in recent years of instruction in chemistry and physics has led to a great accession of candidates for scholarships at the universities in chemistry and physics. This has led to competition becoming very severe. The standards of attain-ment among the candidates have been greatly enhanced and the standard of difficulty of these examinations has also risen. This, in turn, has led to an excessive concentration on the subject of chemistry and physios at schools by boys seeking scholarships in those subjeots, particularly at Oxford and Cambridge. (Para-graphs 33 to 65.)
(x) As a result of this specialisation, it has been extremely difBoult for a new subject, such as biology, to establish itself in the school curricula. Further, it has tended to result in boys&apos; attain-ments in biology not being regarded as of scholarship value unless they reach a standard comparable with that prevailing in chemistry and physics. This places the biological candidate in a special difficulty, as, if he is to do his ultimate work properly, he must, on the one hand, have at least a grounding in physics and a sound know-ledge of chemistry, while, on the other hand, he clearly cannot approach the existing scholarship standard in either of these subjects, especially if biology means two subjects, namely, zoology and botany. (Paragraphs 56 to 57.)(xi) The remedies for this over-specialisation rest partly with the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge and partly with the Faculties of Science at these and other universities.  They are as follows :-(a) The  position would be greatly eased if the scholarshipexaminations for biologists were so framed by the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge that, while paying due attention to physics and chemistry as well as to biology, they recognised fully that the standard in every branch must be definitely lower than that now attained in physics and chemistry scholarships. The general cultural value of the education at school of the young scientist, whether chemist, physicist, or biologist, would be greatly enhanced if the school curriculum provided for his being adequately taught at least one modern language (preferably German). This would be secured if proficiency in one modern language was definitely regarded as a serious element in the award of scholarships by the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge.   (Paragraphs 58 to 60.)(b) The Faculties of Science at the universities also have it intheir power to discourage excessive specialisation in the schools on particular branches of science. For instance, students working for Part I, Natural Science Tripos, at Cambridge, might be compelled to show some knowledge of a biological subect and some proficiency in modern languages. The amendment in this sense of the regula-tions governing the Tripos would be of great benefit to science students generally and to biologists in particular. The advantages of modifications on these lines should be brought to the attention of the Faculties of Science at Oxford and Cambridge, London University, and the Provincial Universities.*   (Paragraphs 69 to 73.)Post-Graduate Training in Biology.(xii) In biology, as in other branches of science, most of the students of the highest attainments who desire to take up pure research secure, immediately after graduation, appointments either in the universities or in research institutes. For those who desire to take up applied biology the existing provision for post-graduate training is ample, except in regard to veterinary science, and fails only in the numbers of recruits attracted to higher study and research.   (Paragraphs 80 to 93.)The Problem of the Supply of Teachers.(xiii) The problem of the supply of teachers for the schools gives grave cause for anxiety, for unless there are those who are competent to teach biology in the schools it is impossible to create the pool out of which the biological services are to be maintained. In existing conditions, after Government, industry and the universities haye taken their toll, there is left only a small margin to teach in the schools.   (Paragraph 68.)* The special difficulties referred to above in regard to scholarship examinations do not apply with equal force to the English Provincial Universities or to the Scottish Universities. Similarly, as regards the Scottish Universities, the suggested modifications in the Honours science course do not apply, as the regulations are framed in such a manner that the student of physics, chemistry, and mathematics must include at least one biological subject and no student of biology can escape chemistry and physics. (Para-graphs 74 to 79.)
(xiv) The introduction of biology into the schools as a general cultural subject is essential in that the interests of the ordinary boy require consideration as much as the scholarship candidate. There is wanted in the schools not only the science teacher who has taken Honours in biology at the university as his principal subject, but also the science teacher who is able to introduce students, other than biological specialists, to biology as a cultural subject. The suggestions we have made that the regulations, governing Honours science degrees at the universities should be modified so as to compel candidates to show some knowledge of a biological subject will go far to supply the type of science teacher that is urgently required in the schools.   (Paragraph 68.)Steps Required to give Effect to Policy Recommended.(xv) If effect is to be given to the conclusions indicated in the previous paragraphs, negotiations will be required between the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, with the Faculties of Science at the various universities, and with the Headmasters and science teachers in the secondary schools. It is unlikely that the merits of the policy indicated above will of itself provide a driving force sufficiently strong to reconcile the points of view of the various interests affected. It is essential that His Majeuty&apos;s Government should be a party to these negotiations if they are to be carried to a successful issue.   (Paragraphs 114-117.)(b) RECOMMENDATION.119. We recommend that, as no one Minister is responsible for all the matters dealt with in our Report, and as it was on the recommendation of the President of the Board of Education that we were appointed, the Economic Advisory Council should recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the first instance, to invite the President of the Board of Education, in consultation with those of his Ministerial colleagues who are immediately concerned, to prepare for their consideration concrete plans for the initiation and conduct of the negotiations required to give effect to our Report.(Signed)      CHELMSFOED, Chairman.

APPENDIX II.Statistical Notes.Note 1.Number of Biological Appointments Anticipated.No evidence has been submitted as to the number of biologists required annually to fill teaching and research posts in universities in this country. Xhe importance of the demand in this direction can be judged from the figures given below showing the nature of the appointments taken up by men who have recently graduated.For school teaching evidence has been received from a firm of scholastic agents, which during last year received applications from men and women to fill 2,000 school masterships and 1,600 mistress-ships. Of the posts for men, 35 were posts requiring qualified biologists, and in another 85 knowledge of biology was a useful z-ecommendation. In 39 of the posts for mistresses botany was required as a special subject and in a large number of others as a subsidiary.In England and Wales there are at present 282 posts in the various agricultural services, with an average of 8 vacancies per annum. These 282 posts include 36 entomologists, 30 mycologists, 28 geneticists, 33 bio-chemists, 25 bacteriologists, and 23 botanists.In Scotland there are said to be 37 research and administrative posts, excluding all university appointments.From the majority of the Dominions reports were received showing tha&apos; they expected to rely in future mainly on their own universities for training candidates for their biological appointments. The Government of New Zealand reported that they would probably require 9 biologists during the next 3 years, such posts being available to candidates from this country.From the Government of India a detailed report was received showing the. number of posts anticipated to fall vacant or to be created during the next 10 years, which were as follows : botany, including economic botany and plant physiology 16, zoology and veterinary science 10, entomology 6, bacteriology and proto-zoology 6, general biology 5, bio-chemistry 3 and mycology 3, making a total of 49 in all, or an average of 5 per annum.The average number of appointments filled in forestry during recent years has been 14 annually in the Colonial Forestry Service, 4.in the Burma Forestry Service and two or three in the service of the Forestry Com-missioners in England. All these must be graduates in the subject of forestry : the candidates for the Burma service being chosen at the age of 18 and sent through the Oxford School of Forestry. It is unlikely that there will be in future any considerable demand from the Dominions for forestry officers, while the position with regard to India is said to be uncertain.Excluding the Medical Service, there are in the Colonial Service approxi-mately 800 appointments for which biologists are required, and of these 340 have been created since 1921. The Colonial Agricultural Service employs 443 officers, of whom 319 are agricultural officers and 124 specialists; of the: latter 59 are botanists and mycologists, 30 are entomologists, and 35 agricultural and soil chemists. The Veterinary Service comprises 136 officers, of whom 18 are specialists, while there are 178 officers in the Forestry Service, including 6 specialists. In addition, biologists are required in connexion with tsetse research, fisheries investigations, &amp;c, while there-are a few appointments in museums.The Colonial Agricultural, Veterinary, and Forestry Services are likely to-take in normal circumstances about 60 men per annum, of whom not more than one-third will be required to be specialists.Account must also be taken of certain non-Governmental research stations, &amp;c, in the Colonies, such as the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad, the Rubber Besearch Institute in Malaya, and the-Rubber, Tea, and Coconut Research Stations in Ceylon. There are approxi-mately 40 highly trained specialists employed at these Stations, the large-majority of whom are biologists.Reports were also received from the Governments of Southern Rhodesia and the Sudan. The former Government now employs 4 biologists from&apos; this country, of whom 3 are entomologists, and anticipates requiring perhaps a further 6 during a few years. The Government of the Sudan now employs 11 entomologists, 2 mycologists and one biologist, but anticipates no-vacancies during the next 5 years.Two further sources of demand for biologists have been reported to the Committee, the veterinary profession and the Natural History Museum. The number of veterinary surgeons at work in this country was given as about 2,350 in practice, 153 employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, 152 employed, by the Army, 76 employed by local authorities, and 48 employed in teaching and research, and 461 were said to be employed in the Dominions, India, and the Colonies. This figure includes private veterinary practitioners overseas in addition to those in the employment of Colonial Governments. The annual requirements are estimated at 15 to 20 for overseas, 6 to 7 for local authority service, 5 for research work, 3 to 4 for the Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s service, 2 for Army service, in addition to those required to supply the wastage of the ordinary profession.The Natural History Museum has, since the war, taken 10 zoologists, 6 botanists and 5 entomologists.[22409]
Note 2.Appointments Obtained by Graduates in Biology.Detailed evidence has been received from Cambridge showing the work subsequently undertaken by men obtaining biological degrees during recent years (1920-28). During this period 35 degrees with 1st class honours had been awarded (14 in botany, 10 in zoology and 9 in bio-chemistry), 33 second-class degrees (18 botany, 11 zoology and 4 in bio-chemistry) and 15 third-class degrees (12 in botany, 3 in zoology). These figures refer to men only.Of the graduates with first-class honours, 17 have undertaken University work, 7 are employed by research Institutions, other than Universities in this country, 6 are in the Colonial Service, 2 in industry and one in teaching. Of the second-class men, 11 are in the Colonial Service, 6 in Universities, 7 in other research work at home. 4 in teaching and 5 in other professions. Of the third-class men, 6 are in the Colonial Service, 4 in teaching, 4 in University and research work.The corresponding figures for Oxford are only available for zoologists. There have been 23 graduates with first and second-class honours in this subject during the past 10 years. Of these, 11 hold academic posts, 3 other research posts, 2 are teaching and 2 are in the Colonial Service. Graduates of the Imperial College of Science during the past 5 years have obtained appointments as follows : University work in this country 24, research work in this country 22, research work overseas 19, Colonial Agricultural Service 13, service of the Cotton Corporation 8.Another return shows that 25 of the Staff have left the Rothamsted station to take up other appointments since 1927. Of these, nine have gone to industrial appointments, 10 to University appointments (of which four were overseas), and 6 to governmental posts (of which two were overseas).Finally, figures have been given showing that of specialists in animal nutrition an average of 6 per annum have been placed during the last few years.Note 3.Numbers talcing Biology at Secondary Schools.School certificate and matriculation have been taken during recent years by some 16,000 botanical candidates annually.It appears that about 95 per cent, of these were girls. The number of candidates taking Natural History has been rising rapidly and was 774 in 1927; the number of candidates taking zoology has been round about 100 for some years.The School Certificate returns for 1929 show 550 boys taking botany, 228 taking biology, 25 taking zoology and 120 taking agricultural science. The percentage of passes is given at 70 to 80 per cent.The figures for Wales show 52 boys passing biology in 1929, 22 passing botany and 21 passing agricultural science. Nearly 700 girls passed in these subjects.At Higher Certificate Standard the number of boys and girls taking biological subjects is found to be very considerably reduced. The Board of Education return for 1929 shows 502 candidates in botany, of whom 372 passed, 206 candidates in zoology, of whom 160 passed and 89 in biology, of whom 74 passed. These figures include both boys and girls. The figures for the sexes can be separated for the Higher Certificate Examination of the northern Universities, from which it appears that, in botany, only 9 per cent, of the candidates are boys, in zoology 31 per cent., in biology 85 per cent. (E.A.C. (E.S.B.) 12). It appears that, in botany and zoology, about 25 to 30 per cent, of the boys taking the subject were taking it as a subsidiary subject.The total of Scottish Leaving Certificates given in biological subjects in 1930 was 275, of which 244 were in botany; 31 of the botany candidates were boys, and none of the zoology or physiology candidates.In Wales in 1929, 8 boys and 54 girls (of which latter 40 were taking botany) entered for Higher Certificate; 5 boys and 41 girls passed (E.A.C. (E.S.B.) 25).For the Oxford and Cambridge Higher Certificate Examinations in 1929 40 boys submitted zoology as a principal subject, 34 botany and 30 biology (E.A.C. (E.S.B.) 26), of these, 32, 27 and 24 respectively passed, 6 with distinction. The number of girls taking this examination was only 21 altogether, all of whom passed.Note 4.Intended Careers of Boys taking Biology at School.In addition to the evidence submitted from the non-grant-aided secondary Schools, a special inquiry by the Board of Education was made into the intended careers of 324 boys, being the boys taking biology at the majority of Schools where the subject was taught up to the 6th Form standard. It appeared that 112 of these boys were intending to take medicine as a
career, 65 to become biological specialists, 55 to teach, 2 to become veterinary surgeons, 90 were still uncertain. From the nature of the information, it is clear that no great weight should be put upon statements by boys as to their future careers, except that these figures serve as an indication of the extent of the demands made by the medical profession upon boys taking biology at School, in this case about a third of the total.Note 5.Biological Scholarships to the Vnioersities.At Cambridge during the last 10 years there have been 2,115 candidates for science scholarships, of whom 352 have offered biology. The number of scholarships awarded was 371, of which 83 were for biology. The number of biological scholarships during the last 3 years was 9, 13 and 18 respectively.At Oxford the number of candidates for biological scholarships during -those 3 years was 8, 10 and 17 respectively, and scholarships awarded were 5, 4 and 3.Evidence has been received showing the number of biological entrance scholarships awarded during recent years at the following universities : London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Bristol, Reading, North Wales and Armstrong College, Newcastle. The number of awards of Entrance Scholarships in biological subjects have been 11, 15, 15, -22 and 16 respectively in the past 5 years (1926 to 1930 inclusive). These, with two scholarships where the date of award is not given, make -81 Entrance Scholarships in Biology out of a total of 460 Science Scholar-ships awarded during the same period. The majority of the Science Scholarships were taken by Physics and Chemistry; the returns appeared in general to exclude Scholarships in Medicine and Engineering. Of this total of 460 Science Scholarships, about 110 were awarded on the results of the Higher Certificate Examination, the remainder on the results of special examinations. For these Universities there appears to be some evidence that, on balance, more students take Degree Examinations in Biology than would appear from these figures (t.e., that students obtaining scholarships in other subjects sometimes take biology as their degree course).Note 6.Number of Students reading Biology at Oxford and Cambridge.At Cambridge a large number of students read biological sciences up to the standard of Tripos, Part I, and then abandon them. In the Spring of 1930 it was stated that there were 100 students reading botany, Part I, and only 6 reading Part II. A more thorough survey of the position is ,given by comparing figures of the number of candidates for Part I in 1928 with the number for Part II in 1929, which are as follows : Physi-     Bio-Botany. Zoology, ology. Chemistry. Candidates in Part I in 1928 ...      58 43 28Candidates for Part II in 1929       6 9 2 2Figures have also been submitted showing the number of students taking -courses in Zoology for Tripos, Part I. The average number during the jpast 5 years have been as follows : 1926-27.        1927-28. 1928-29. 1929-30. 1930-31.162 172 185 222 225** Michaelmas Term only.It must be concluded from this Table that many more students attend courses than take the Part I examination. The Table shows a rapid rise in the number of students attending courses on this subject.At Oxford in 1929 the Agricultural finals were taken by 59 candidates, of whom one was a woman, the Physiological finals by 45 men, the forestry iinals by 44 men, the zoology finals by 5 men, the botany finals by one man and 5 women.During the past 5 years the number of students taking the subject of Zoology (i.e., the number at all stages of the course) has been 14 in 1927, 16 in 1928, 23 in 1929, 25 in 30, 29 in 1930-31.The School of Forestry at Oxford appears to be closely linked with recruitment, in that applicants for most official posts must be graduates in forestry. The number of students taking the course of training (2 or 8 years) has risen rapidly from 30 in 1926 to 70 in 1930.Note 7.Grants to Biological Students by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research has at present :17 grant-aided research workers in various Universities working on biological subjects. The number has fallen fairly steadily from 41 in 1924. This maximum in 1924 is said to have been due to a large number of men -discharged from the services at the end of the War taking advantage of the Departments scholarships for post-graduate work.
Note 8.Post-graduate Scholarships and Courses in Biology.Through the Colonial Agricultural Scholarship Scheme about 20 candidates are recruited annually for the Colonial Agricultural Service.&apos; One hundred and fourteen scholarships have been awarded since 1925, and. the number of applicants has averaged 86 over the last three years.A similar Colonial Veterinary Scholarship Scheme was instituted in 1930, when 9 scholarships were awarded, the number of candidates being 35. It is hoped that an average of 10 scholarships will be awarded annually under this scheme.The Ministry of Agriculture runs three separate scholarship schemes. Research Scholarships, General Scholarships, and Special Scholarships for the sons and daughters of rural workers. For the Research Scholarships, there have been, during recent years, some 20 to 30 applicants annually and the annual awards have averaged 6 or 7. The Scottish Board of Agriculture has, in addition, been awarding about three Research Scholarships annually. For the other two schemes (the General Agricultural Scholarships and Special Scholarships for sons and daughters of rural workers) the annual awards have averaged recently 5 and 12 respectively.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine runs two courses annually. The figures of full students for 1930 show 41 men and 6 women, as against 61 men and 4 women in 1929.The Imperial College has at present 25 post-graduate research workers in entomology, of whom 7 are women, and 6 in zoology, of whom one is a woman.About 8 Studentships are awarded annually by the Empire Cotton-Growing Corporation.APPENDIX III.Facilities for the Teaching of Biology at the Unieersitits.(a) Oxford.The teaching of biology is under the Faculty of Biological Sciences, and; consists, of instruction by lecture, demonstration, practical work,, and seminar, in the Departments of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, Botany, Biochemistry, Physiology, Forestry, Rural Economy, and Geology.The courses of instruction are on two levels, viz. : (1) Preliminary, and (2) Final Honours.No student may pursue a Final Honour course until he has passed the First Public Examination, which, in the case of science, includes : (1) mathematics; (2) mechanics and physics; (3) chemistry; (4) biology (zoology and botany); (5) physics and chemistry. To pass this examination a student must satisfy the examiners in two subjects of the above list, and in Holy Scripture or a book substituted for the same. A student who intends to study a biological Final Honours course must, therefore, obtain a sound elementary knowledge of zoology and botany, and of another subject or subjects which in 99 per cent, of cases is physics and chemistry. In addition, the First Public Examination includes examinations in agriculture,, and in forestry, for students of those subjects, which differ from the others-in not being Honour Schools.Lectures last 1 hour and are followed by practical work lasting usually 2  hours. The preliminary courses in zoology and botany consist of 3 lectures and 3 practical periods per week for 24- weeks. The Final Honour courses in zoology or botany consist of 8 lectures and 6 practical periods per week on the average for 4S weeks.The preliminary examination (First Public Examination) in zoology and botany includes 2 theoretical and 2 practical papers, and a viva voce examination, and is conducted by 2 examiners in each subject, i.e., 4 in all. The schedule includes the general outlines of the anatomy, physiology, classification, evolution, reproduction, behaviour and genetics, of animals and plants. It will be noted that these subjects cover the whole of biology, and the standard required is reasonably high, though not as high as that of the First Part of the Cambridge Tripos. There are in the current academical year 63 persons studying zoology and botany in the preliminary courses. The Final Examinations of the Honours School of Natural Science in zoology, or in botany, include not less than 4 theoretical papers and not less than 4 practical papers, and a viva voce examination, conducted by 2 examiners (in each subject). The standard required is high, and is believed to be higher than in any other institution. There are in the current academical year 29 students studying zoology in the Final Honours course. When making comparisons with other institutions, it is to be noted that the Final Honour School of Zoology at Oxford corresponds to Part II of the Cambridge Tripos.
The instruction, given in the Science Departments of the University is -supposed to be supplemented by private tuition given by the College Tutors. There are, however, at the moment, no Fellows of Colleges who are tutors in zoology. Students reading for the Final Honours course in zoology obtain tuition from the Demonstrators of the Department (1 hour of individual tuition per week by private arrangement); but most of the students engaged in the preliminary course in zoology have to forgo private tuition.It is clear that under the existing conditions at Oxford, a student who passes the Final Examination in zoology will have a less extensive knowledge of the other scientific subjects than, say, a student who takes the Cambridge Tripos. In common with other Oxford Honour Schools, the aim is to give the student a very thorough and deep knowledge of a subject, and such a training in methods as will enable him to embark successfully on original research.Attention may be drawn to the following evidence as to the manner in which this aim has been reached :  Over 80 per cent, of the students who have taken the Final Examination in zoology since the War have obtained a 1st or a 2nd Class.Over 60 per cent, of the students who have taken the Final Examination in zoology since the War are known to have obtained salaried posts.These salaried posts range from : a Professorship in Zoology; a Professorship in Anthropology; University Lecturerships and Demonstrator-ships; College Fellowships; Public School masterships; Training College teachers&apos; posts; Research workers&apos; posts in zoology, marine biology, entomology, cancer-research and tissue-culture; Museum curatorships; and the post of Game-Warden. The Department, therefore, feels justified in claiming that its teaching renders its students fit for posts in all possible branches of biology. The quality of students who have been through the -Oxford Honours School seems to be so much appreciated outside Oxford, that inquiries are continually being received from Heads of Departments and Institutions elsewhere, who wish to fill posts in biology, as to whether the Department can supply them.Students who take a 2nd Class are in no way handicapped in obtaining posts.Numerous - original contributions to zoological knowledge have already been made by students who have passed through the Department since the War, and their published works include many books and over 50 monographs and papers.A scheme is in the air for considering the desirability of broadening the basis of the general scientific training before a student embarks on the Final Honours course. The object of the scheme can be stated briefly as follows: to consider the advisability of having an intermediate step in the curriculum -on a broader basis and on a higher level than the existing preliminary -examination, without reducing the high-standard of the Finals course.(Initialled)      G. R. de B.(b) Cambridge.Instruction in science is by lecture, demonstration and practical work. The lecture occupies one hour and the related practical work two hours. The &quot; course &quot; normally includes three lectures a week for three terms.Four Faculties are concerned with biology, namely :  Faculty of Biology A :  takes Anatomy, Botany, Geology and Zoology.(Anatomy is here considered as a tripos subject, the more limited medical or surgery anatomy is under the Medical Board.)Faculty of Biology B : takes Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology and Psychology.The Faculty of Medicine.The Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry.Faculties of Biology A and B cover the work for the Natural Sciences Tripos and for the Ordinary Degree. Courses of lectures in practical work for the Natural Sciences Tripos are distinguished as :  I. &quot; Elementary.&quot;II. &quot; Intermediate &quot;;   these  relate   to part I of the  tripos and are intended respectively for the first and second years. III. Advanced courses of very special type for part II of the tripos.The regulations for the Ordinary Degree are designed to give a general training. The candidate is required to pass in six subjects, which have to be selected from a list divided into &quot;principal&quot; subjects and &quot;subsidiary&quot; subjects. Principal and subsidiary subjects fall into two groups. Group (1) -covering what may roughly be called the humanities, the Bible, Church history, languages, history, law, music, art, &amp;c. Group (2) covers science and in group (2) there are. the biological subjects, botany, zoology and physiology.In the examinations for the Ordinary Degree English essays are a prominent feature and &quot; account should be taken of the use of careful, exact, and grammatical language. . . .&quot; The principal subjects are taught -as a rule through lectures for part I of the science tripos.   For the subsidiary
subjects there are special courses with &quot; snappy &quot; titles, such as &quot; Every-day Seience,&quot; &quot; Fresh-water Life and Fishing,&quot; &quot; The Sun, the Stars and the Universe.&quot;There is, in addition, a two-term course in elementary biology, the first term (Michaelmas Term) is conducted by the staff of the Zoological Laboratory, and the second term (Lent Term) by that of the Botany School. In the May Term there is a &quot; Repetition Class.&quot; The course in elementary biology is governed in part by the schedule for the first M.B. examination. That schedule, however, is remarkably wide. It literally covers the whole of biology, the only restriction, a necessary one, being a specification of types of animals and plants. I am surprised, looking at the schedule, that anyone-can feel hampered by it.The biological examinations for the Ordinary Degree are also limited by schedules which are of the same general character as that for the first c- M.B. biology.    There are no schedules for the Tripos examination savemathematics.Before leaving teaching I should note that the Colleges supplement University teaching by what is known as &quot; College Supervision.&quot; &quot; Supervisors &quot; are appointed to conduct small classes at which informal instruction by question and answer or written essay is given, and to which men go once a week in each subject. For example, a student taking botany, zoology and chemistry might attend as many as&quot; three informal classes a week.The subjects of examination in the Natural Sciences Tripos are in Part I: chemistry, physics, mineralogy, geology, botany, zoology and comparative anatomy,* physiology, anatomy, mathematics; in Part II the same, but omitting mathematics and adding biochemistry and pathology.In each part there is an essay paper on the &quot; fundamental principles, history or philosophy of the Natural Sciences.&quot; In my experience the essay paper had real effect in deciding the position of borderline cases.In each subject the examination consists of written answers, practical work and, during practical work, an important amount of &quot; viva.&quot;Tart I, where candidates are numbered by the hundred, has the feature of an ordinary examination. In part II, where candidates are few, everything is pitched at a high level, and the examiners look not so much for mass of knowledge as for intellectual distinction.In each subject there are internal and external examiners and all questions are submitted for approval to all the examiners sitting as a board.The examiners receive no direction as to the number of subjects a candidate shall take. A candidate can take as few or many as he likes and in any combination. The standard of the examination is loosely defined by tradition.Candidates for Part I usually take three or four subjects. Scholars used to take four but not always. Four-subject men are not rare. In 1930 they were 16 per cent, of the candidates, half of whom (8 per cent.) took a biological subject. Of the first class 50 per cent, took four subjects, so that the best men have a really wide education still.In Part I :-Biologists usually take zoology, physiology, chemistry, zoology, botany, chemistry, zoology, botany, geology, zoology, botany, physiology, botany, physiology, chemistry.Medical Students usually take anatomy, physiology and one of chemistry or zoology.Physics is rarely taken by a biologist because of the mathematics.Sometimes   it  appears   as  a   &quot; fourth  subject &quot;   and   only   thedescriptive and experimental parts attended to. Mathematics, I am sorry to say, is practically never taken.It is important to note that physiology in Part I includes biochemistry and that the staffs of the Physiological and Biochemical Laboratories combine to teach &quot;physiology.&quot;&quot;What might be called confirmed biologists, who actively dislike chemistry and physics, prefer to take three biological subjects. Good tutors discourage this practice because it means ill-educated biologists.Entomology. From the nature of the evidence given to the Committee I am obliged to classify Entomologists amongst those having a limited biologicaL training. This definition is, however, not accepted in Cambridge, where an endeavour is consciously made to give the entomologist a broad education in science.   I find Cambridge zoologists apt to think that the slow progress in.* That is how the list stands in the Ordinances, but it is understood that in practice the division now is between zoology and anatomy with comparative anatomy, the human being accepted merely as one of the various, kinds of animals.
field work made by entomologists is partly due to their lack of general scientific training.   Whether there is any justice in this I am not able to say.There is a first examination common to the Degree courses in agriculture and forestry and a first-year course of lectures for it. Botany is one of the subjects and it is taught by a member of the staff of the Department of Agriculture.The work for the second year in agriculture includes &quot; agricultural botany,&quot; &quot;agricultural zoology and physiology.&quot; These courses are conducted by the staff of the Department of Agriculture.The second-year work in forestry includes a course in forest botany and the third-year work includes a course of forest zoology. These are conducted by the staff of the School of Forestry.The Departments of Agriculture and Forestry, therefore, are self-contained so far as biology is concerned.(Initialled)      W. B. H.(c) London University.The University of London, so far as it is a teaching institution, consists of a congeries of colleges and schools differing very greatly from one another in their aims and in the size and general character of their various depart-ments. These range from the Department of Physiology at University College, within which nearly fifty men conduct researches, to many in the Polytechnics with a single &quot; recognised teacher.&quot;All these institutions, whatever their rank, prepare students for the same examinations, each of which has, in consequence, to be conducted in strict accordance with a published schedule, which may become a detailed syllabus. This syllabus is drawn up by the Board of Studies in the subject with which it deals, and hence represents a minimum requirement within the powers even of the weaker departments.The teaching of the more powerful departments always extends far beyond the syllabus and their students are therefore handicapped in the examination for bachelor degrees.The examinations are of an ordinary character, but it is a university regulation, which is strictly adhered to, that a candidate must pass in both written and practical work. In most subjects they must translate short passages of French and German, gaining marks by so doing. This device, intended to insure that all graduates shall have a working knowledge of these languages, has failed to secure its end.The University grants two different kinds of Bachelor of Science degrees, the General degree in three equal subjects, and the special degree in one principal and one subsidiary subject.The first year&apos;s work, ending with an Intermediate examination is the same for both types. All students study four subjects chosen from the following list, their choice being only limited by the stipulation that one at least must be chosen from the three placed first: mathematics, applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, botany, zoology, general principles of biology, military studies, geography and general physiology.In practice nearly all biology students take chemistry, physics, botany and zoology, a course equivalent to that for the 1st M.B., but perhaps of a slightly higher standard.Students may sit for the final B.Sc. examination at the end of their third session, and usually do so, but an increasing minority of those who enter for a special degree postpone their examination for a further session.The University session is composed of three terms, each about eleven weeks in length.The General B.Sc. final examination is in three subjects chosen from a -list of fifteen, of which those which have been chosen by biologists are-pure mathematics, applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, psychology, botany, zoology, physiology, anthropology, geography and&apos; human anatomy and morphology. Common combinations are : botany, chemistry, zoology; zoology, physiology, chemistry; botany, geology, zoology; mathematics, botany, geography.The General Degree is unfortunately taken chiefly by weak students, who lose caste with their fellows by doing so. The courses are always crowded, filling the students&apos; time far too completely, but the standard attained is respectable, not differing greatly from that of Part I of the Science Tripos at Cambridge.It is possible, and the practice appears to be growing, for a student who-has taken a General B.Sc. to spend an additional year in study and then enter for a special degree in one subject.The Special B.Sc. can be taken two years after the Intermediate examination.The principal subject may be any one of twenty-one, of which those of biological interest are : anthropology (general), biochemistry, botany, embryology and cytology, geology, human anatomy and morphology, physiology, statistics and zoology.One of these subjects is studied intensively, the student spending on it rather more than two-thirds of his time for six terms. In each week he will attend from four to six lectures and spend three and a half days in the laboratory. .The subsidiary subject is chosen by the student from a list of twenty-one, and must be related in some way to the principal subject. Common combinations are :  Principal subject, zoology, subsidiary, physiology, botany,[22409] O
chemistry, geology; principal, botany, subsidiary, chemistry, zoology, geology, physics; principal, physiology, subsidiary, human anatomy (2nd M.B.), chemistry, biochemistry.Biochemistry is usually taken by men who have already a special degree in chemistry.The standard of the subsidiary subject is that of the ordinary degree, that of the principal subject is equivalent to Part II of the Science Tripos at -Cambridge.Instruction in all these subjects is given by lectures, laboratory work and &apos;&quot; seminars,&quot; each school undertaking the bulk of the work for every subject with which it is concerned. But all the larger schools provide &apos;&apos; inter-collegiate &quot; courses dealing with special branches of a science. These, which often include much laboratory work, may be attended by any member of the University.In addition, large numbers of short courses of advanced lectures are given by men of distinction on the subject of their own researches.It is thus possible for a biology student in London to receive a wide general training or to carry the study of a single science to a further point. If he chooses one of the larger colleges he will have access to a library -containing a respectable representation of the periodical literature of his science and thus learn the use of books, but in the smaller places his reading will be largely restricted to text-books.The Imperial College of Science, although part of the London University, -differs from all the other Schools in the plan of its teaching and in having its own independent examinations for bachelor degrees. In it subjects are studied in &quot;tandem,&quot; the studenfs whole energies being devoted to one subject at a time.The biology courses begin with four terms&apos; work at six subjects, zoology, botany, geology, physics, chemistry and mathematics, and then pass on to a specialisation on zoology and botany, leading to a special degree in hiology, botany or zoology.The college is, unfortunately, without a department of Physiology, so that students of zoology cannot receive the invaluable training in experimental method which that subject provides.The College is of great importance to the University because it conducts an &quot; inter-collegiate course &quot; of entomology, which is attended by most of the zoology students in London. In addition, it holds a much more extensive course, the practical work of which is done not only in South Kensington, but also in the field laboratory near Slough. This course is intended for men who have already a special degree in zoology and is designed to train them for posts as economic entomologists.The botanical department at the Imperial College is the largest and best rquipped in London and is the only one which devotes much attention to such things of economic importance- as mycology and plant pathology.Research.The larger schools of the University are prepared to receive post-graduate students and to train them in methods of research. Many departments can -offer to such students the advice of distinguished men and the use of ample collections of apparatus and materials. But their situation within a great town makes it impossible for them to provide facilities in such important subjects as oceanography and fisheries research, agricultural helminthology and all those things which depend on daily access to the sea or countryside.This lack is in part made up by the association with the University of certain research institutions, which give training to post-graduate biologists, either as research students or as Assistants.Of these one of the most important is the Agricultural Besearch institute at Rothamsted. There all branches of biology which bear on agriculture are being studied, either fundamentally, as is the case with the physics of the soil, and the variations of number of protista which live in it; or with a direct relation to.some immediate agricultural problem. The departments of statistics, protozoology, mycology and entomology, amongst others, can afford a training in research on lines differing from those available elsewhere.The John Innes Horticultural Station at Merton has for long been the centre of the British work- on mendelian heredity, and still continues its experiments.   It has trained many men in the technique of genetics of plants.The London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, which is part of the University, possesses an active department of Helminthology, whose -agricultural branch has investigators in many parts of the country, and has .a farm laboratory in Hertfordshire.The Department of Entomology is devoted chiefly to physiological work and thus admirably supplements that at the Imperial College.&apos;The Francis Galton Laboratory of National Eugenics is the property of the University, but is controlled by University College; it includes a biometrio laboratory and provides both Undergraduate and post-graduate instruction in -Statistical theory and methods with especial reference to Biological problems.The Lister Institute of Preventative Medicine and the National Institute for Medical Research receive what are, in effect, research students in physiology, biochemistry, protozoology, bacteriology, &amp;c. Their work on -such subjects, although it is devoted to problems of Human disease, is of interest to all biologists and has led to the development of methods of investigation which are of wider applicability than the titles of the Institutions would suggest.Apart from the somewhat specialised Medical schools, the University of London possesses no places where the technique of investigation of micro-organisms can be studied by under-graduates.
Agriculture.The Agricultural facility of the University is represented entirely by the Wye Agricultural College.The course of study leading to the degree of B.Se. (Agriculture) extends over three years. Of these, the first is devoted to an intermediate course similar to that for the B.Se. in chemistry, physics, botany and zoology,, including elementary anatomy and physiology of farm animals.The final course, occupying two sessions, includes agriculture (with geology applied to agriculture), biochemistry in relation to agriculture, agricultural botany and agricultural engineering.Horticultxire.The University also grants a degree in horticulture after a three-year course.The Intermediate examination is in six subjects. The final course includes : practice of horticulture, entomology, principles of horticulture and book-keeping.It is probable that the courses of Agriculture and Horticulture are too diffuse and rest on too small a basis of knowledge of the fundamental sciences to give an adequate training to biologists who may wish to proceed to research.Veterinary Science.The University of London offers a degree in Veterinary Science, which is not a registerable qualification and differs a good deal in its scope from the Diploma of the Royal College of Veterinary Science, which confers a licence to practice.   The degree is thus practically a dead letter.The only institution teaching Veterinary Medicine is the Royal College in Camden Town. This is so hampered by its obsolete, insecure and inadequate, buildings and by its extremely small income, that it can do little to provide veterinary surgeons with a wide foundation of the fundamental sciences.The University possesses the Brown Animal Sanatory Institution, which, includes an Animals&apos; Hospital and a laboratory, under the control of a Superintendent, in which much valuable research in pathology has been carried out.London can thus provide instruction in almost all branches of biology at any stage, from that of the Intermediate year to the fully-established research worker.The effect of the University regulations is to ensure that all its students shall receive some grounding. in a wide range of sciences and devote two sessions to obtaining an insight into the ideas and methods of a fundamental science before they pass on to consider its application to practical economic problems.Only in the case of the special degrees in Agriculture, Horticulture and Veterinary Science is this conception departed from, and these subjects in practice do not produce many men who develop into research workers.(Initialled)      D. M. S. W.(d) The English Provincial Universities.I. Each of the eight Provincial Universities (Durham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol and Reading) which form the United Constituency has, apart from the Faculties or Departments of &quot; Applied &quot; Sciences (engineering in all its branches, metallurgy, &amp;c), strong and well-equipped Faculties or Departments of pure science (physical and natural). In each of the eight Botany and Zoology are respectively represented by one or more Professors, with the requisite complement of staff and laboratories both for undergraduate, post-graduate and advanced or research work; and these biological departments are in close touch with South Kensington, Kew and the leading research or specialist stations either in Great Britain or the Continent. Instruction is given by lectures, demonstrations and laboratory work; and, where required, by &quot; seminars and field work. In seven of the Universities there are Faculties of Medicine which form and control the &quot; recognised &quot; Medical Schools, and in which, besides the clinical sciences and training for the medical profession, physiology, bacteriology and bio-chemistry are strongly represented. None of these three &quot; allied &quot; branches of biological science are regarded as exclusively medical, nor is the staffing, equipment, teaching or work (particu-larly advanced work) provided in these departments considered to be exclusively medical. Non-medical candidates, both for the Bachelor&apos;s Degree and the higher Degrees in these subjects, can and do obtain the University Degree in science (B.Sc, M.Sc, Ph.D., D.Sc, &amp;c).In four of the eight universities there are, also, well-staffed and equipped Faculties or Departments of Agriculture (with corresponding Degrees and Diplomas), which are closely connected with the Departments and courses given in the Faculty of Science, and provide, by their special organisation, staffs and laboratories, training in &quot;applied biology&quot; (.e,g., agriculture proper, horticulture, &amp;c).II. This brief summary supports the conclusion that in the provincial universities the provision of teaching and training both for undergraduate and post-graduate work in Biology is adequate; and that, if additional students are forthcoming, the staff and equipment to train them are already in[22409] . g 2
4-i-existence. The evidence available points to the welcome fact that in the last five years there has been a slow but steady rise in the number of male undergraduates working at Biology.III. Owing to the advance in secondary education, particularly in the last ten years, &quot;matriculation&quot; as the ordinary condition of entry to a University course has been largely superseded by the Higher School Certifi-cate. The majority who now enter the Faculties of Science in the Provincial Universities have obtained the H.S.C. in the group of subjects which the respective Faculties of Science require. These undergraduates are, thereby, exempted from the University Intermediate course and examination (one year) and are able to enter at once for the Degree Course proper. No Bachelor&apos;s Degree in Science is granted except after a full three years&apos; course in the University. Candidates who have only obtained a &quot; matriculation &quot; certificate (or its equivalent) take the University Intermediate for their first year, passing to the Degree course proper in their second year. The only difference between these two categories of students is in the character of the work done in the minimum period for the first Degree.IV. The organisation of Honours work is (omitting details) bi&apos;oadly based on the principle that a minimum course of three years is required for the B.Sc. with Honours, and the successful candidates for this degree are graded in three classes. No fourth-class Honours in Science are given, and (in fact, owing to weeding out of weak students) third-class Honours under-graduates are distinctly discouraged. The possessor of a Higher School Certificate in. the requisite subjects is normally permitted to enter at once on an Honours course. Other candidates would only enter in their Honours work in their second year, and, if subsequently classed, would have spent a minimum of four years in the University.A candidate for an ordinary (Pass) B.Sc. will qualify for it (according to varying regulations in the different universities of the group) either in one principal (with one or two &quot; subsidiary &quot; but allied subjects) or in two principal and allied subjects. The object of the H.S.C. of the University intermediate (which may be taken as its equivalent) is to secure that, before -entering on the Degree work in the University, the student has had a broad preliminary training in the basic sciences, eg., mathematics, physics and chemistry. An ordinary B.Sc. can, therefore, be obtained in &quot; biology &quot; by combining (pass) botany, zoology and chemistry (or physics) according to the particular regulations as to principal and subsidiary subjects, it being assumed that a biological subject will be the principal subject (or one of the two principal subjects) required by University regulations.V. The Honours courses are (again omitting details) broadly based on the principle, observed at Oxford, of a single subject course, 5.3., botany, zoology, biochemistry, physiology, &amp;c. This does not mean, of course, that a student in such a single subject ,Honours School works exclusively in the Department of his subject. In all the single pure biological subjects (eg., botany or zoology, &amp;c.) chemistry and physics have their assigned part, particularly in the first two years of the Honours course.&quot;VI. Latterly, in several of the Universities of &quot; the Provincial Group &quot; there has been a marked tendency to provide Honours courses and degrees also in two and even three- subjects, grouped as a single Honours course : e.g., combining botany and zoology, or either of these, with chemistry or physics. The reason, for this development is, broadly, the new context given to, and the new interpretation of, &quot; biologj&apos; &quot; as a branch of science distinct from chemistry and physics, and the desirability of training the would-be &quot;biologist&quot; up to a high standard, both in botany and zoology, but not such a specialised standard as is implied in a single-subject course.VII.&apos; This brief summary of the curriculum indicates not only that the Provincial Universities are anxious to provide adequately for biology as an important branch of science in University studies, but that they are prepared to adapt themselves to the changes that have taken place and are rapidly proceeding in the position assigned to biology, the new interpretation of its needs and scope, and the different courses of training required by different types of biological graduates.VIII. In all the eight Provincial Universities the best students in science are encouraged to (and normally do) pass from the Honours B.Sc. to the higher degrees of M.Sc. and the Ph.D. The Master&apos;s Degree involves, by regulations, at least 12 months&apos; whole-time advanced work (with a thesis); in practice, it generally involves eighteen months&apos; work owing to the standard of examination. The minimum for the Ph.D. under a general inter-University convention is two years&apos; whole-time study and work of a 41 research &quot; character on an approved and defined subject. The percentage of Baohelors in Science who proceed at least to the M.Sc. has steadily gone up since 1920, as has, also, the number of those qualifying for the Ph.D. The provision of facilities by professorial supervision and laboratory equip-ment for this post-graduate advanced or research work is regarded as only second in importance to the provision for the training of undergraduates up to the Bachelors&apos; Degree.IX. &quot; Biology &quot; is, also, provided for medical students working for the First M.B. In the provincial centres this is essential. A considerable number of would-be medical students prefer to take the First M.B. at the university, -either because the provision of teaching and laboratories is better, or because in their school &quot; biology &quot; is not adequately taught or not taught at all. &quot; Biology &quot; as a pre-medical subject is regarded by the universities as belonging to Science (and not to Medioine); and while the courses in it enable the student to qualify for entry to the Faculty of Medicine, they are not designed exclusively for that examination, and &quot; pre-medicals &quot; work
999 hi a(Initialled)      C. G. R.-along with other science students and not as a segregated group. Not infrequently, the &quot; pre-medical &quot; is thereby diverted either away from medicine altogether or to the B.Sc. degree before entering on his medioal course proper. This is worth mentioning because it brings out an important point. The attraction and potentialities of &quot; biology &quot; may, for a lad with scientific aptitudes, only become operative after entry to university life and studies, either from lack of previous opportunities or inadequate appreciation of what &quot; biology &quot; offers to those who pursue it.X. Scholarships in science held at this group of Universities fall, roughly, into four categories : scholarships awarded from purely University funds; scholarships awarded by special trusts, within the several areas, in conjunction with the Universities or on their nomination; State scholarships; and scholarships awarded either by the scholar&apos;s school or by the Local Authorities, independently of the Universities and generally tenable along with the purely university scholarships. The State scholarships are awarded on the results of the H.S.C. examination; and there is a general tendency (already complete in two or three Universities) in all the other categories to ^abandon special ad hoc examinations for scholarships and appoint on the results of the H.S.C. examinations and thus work on a common standard both of curriculum, examination papers, and marks. The Joint Matriculation Board of the Northern Universities (Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds -and Birmingham), which is now the largest school-examining body in England, was a creation of the Universities concerned and, though not directly con-trolled by the Universities, is able (by the co-operation of the University representatives with those of the schools) to influence the teaching of science preparatory to entry to the University.Broadly, the result of this acceptance of the H.S.C. for scholarship purposes is, other things being equal, for the ablest candidates of both sexes to enter for and select (if offered) the scholarships of the highest monetary -value, irrespective of the area in which the candidate^ school may be placed.XI. While it is probably true that the ablest boys in the schools of all types within the &quot;provinces&quot; served &quot;by the provincial universities&quot; are reserved and trained for the college scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge, this is not so marked in science as in other subjects, because many of the best science scholars contemplate a university course in applied science, in which these universities can offer at least as good a training as, and often hetter opportunities, than Oxford and Cambridge, for employment after graduation in engineering, metallurgy, &amp;c, and this applies, also, to physics -and chemistry.In biology the provincial universities suffer from two disadvantages : the total number of science scholarships available (see Appendix II, Note 5) is, -compared both with the number of candidates, and with what is offered, particularly by Cambridge, regrettably small; the competition of those who have, at school, specialised in physics and chemistry is formidable; and while it is true that a &quot; science scholar &quot; who has won his scholarship by proficiency in physics and/or chemistry is under no obligation to make physics or chemistry his university course, it is no less true that, as things at present are in the schools, the ablest boys on the pure science side have specialised in chemistry and physics, and enter the University biassed by previous training and outlook towards those two subjects.XII. If the provincial universities, because of their recent origin, suffer from a comparative lack of entrance scholarships (as compared with Oxford :and Cambridge), it is, also, true that their resources in post-graduate Scholarships, Fellowships, &amp;c, are, for the same reason, insufficient. This will, no doubt, right itself in time. Endowments can only be slowly accumulated; and the income of the universities so far has been mainly -required for the staffing and equipment of expanding departments in all the -Faculties, the main function of which is teaching and preparing for the various Bachelor&apos;s degrees. The margin of income for the endowment of research and post-graduate work has been and remains of necessity relatively small. On the other hand, the provincial Bachelor in science of real ability cannot, in nine cases out of ten, afford to add a couple of years to a university -course of three or four years, without financial assistance. Unquestionably, promising recruits to the higher work in science are lost yearly for this reason. The industrial applications of biology have not yet been worked out. Hence, apart from agriculture, and the opportunities that it offers, and from the limited number of scholarships or endowed junior research posts in the Besearch Institution and Stations, in receipt of Government Grants, the joung graduate in biology at the provincial universities is at present under a distinct handicap. An increase in the number of post-graduate scholarships available for young graduates in biology whose scientific aptitude had been previously tested would be very advantageous.XIII. In the Report (paragraph 68) the need for a larger number of teachers of biology, adequately trained, is emphasized. The Provincial Universities which are in close touch with, and are largely recruited from, &quot;hundreds of grant-aided and efficient secondary schools, are in a position, if the undergraduates are forthcoming, to contribute their full quota to this service. The outline of the curriculum and courses for biological students given above indicates that the ordinary B.Sc. Degree (in biology) and the Honours degrees (either in a single-subject or a two-or-three-subject course) can provide young graduates competent to take their part in the general -science work of a school (including biology), and, if they hold the M.Sc. or Th.D., to teach in biology (as in physics or chemistry) up to a high standard, Hf such be required.
(e) The University of Wales.The University of Wales comprises four University Colleges and a. School of Medicine.In three of the four University Colleges, namely, Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff, there are Departments of Pure Botany and of Pure Zoology, each with its Professor and appropriate staff and equipment, providing courses of study of Intermediate, Subsidiary, Final and Honours grades, as well as facilities for post-graduate research. At Swansea there is a Department of Biology, in which the Head of the Department is a Botanist and in which botany is carried to Honours and post-graduate stages, zoology being taken&apos; to Intermediate and Subsidiary levels.The degree courses of the University of Wales are arranged as three-year post-Matriculation schemes of study for Pass degree and four-year schemes for Honours. Candidates preparing for Honours in&apos;botany or zoology cover the Final work during the third year and, in addition, may do further work preliminary to their fourth year, which is devoted entirely to Honours. Students having passed the Higher School Certificate Examination with credit in either botany or zoology are allowed the corresponding exemption from the Intermediate examination in that subject. Students who are thus-exempted from their Intermediate subjects are generally considered for Honours; if they desire to be considered Pass students only and complete the general courses for the Pass degree at the end of their second year, they are required to pursue a third year of study, approved, for each case, by the University.&apos; The subject which is most generally encouraged to be taken to a subsidiary-standard in support of a biological degree is chemistry. Other subjects are,, however, permitted by regulation, c.g., geology, geography, agriculture, physics and mathematics, but combination with either of the two latter is-unusual beyond the Intermediate stage. Botany or zoology may also be included in schemes leading to an Arts degree.Honours Degree courses in the University of Wales are in general upon specialist lines, the whole of the fourth year being devoted to a single Honours subject. Although there is at present no General Honours scheme in which a group of subjects may be taken throughout the i^period of study, there is a growing tendency for arrangements to be made having the effect of breaking down the separateness between departments of study. In the first place, there are certain combined Honours courses between agriculture and the appropriate pure&apos; sciences, and, secondly, there is a growing tendency foi-departments to take advantage of related courses in other departments, for example, biological students in one of the Colleges are recommended to-attend a few lectures on stratigraphy in the Geological Department. The Honours work is largely carried out by essay writing, and the examinations include written and practical work and, in some cases, a thesis embodying the results of original investigation. There is a difference of procedure in this latter matter, some Depatments preferring, as a matter of principle, to include, and others to exclude, such a thesis.Each College has, for all practical purposes, control of its own curricula at all stages for initial degrees and of the examinations at the Intermediate and Subsidiary levels; a common examiner is brought in at the Final and Honours stages, but each College works to its own schemes and an important function of the external examiner is to standardise the results.Facilities are available at all the Colleges for the carrying out of post-graduate work and candidates are regularly trained in methods of research and guided in the preparation of theses&apos;leading to the degrees of M.Sc. and Ph.D. The M.Sc. involves a minimum of one year&apos;s research following an Honours degree (two years following a Pass degree), and an M.Sc. degree or the equivalent thereof is recognised as a condition precedent to embarking upon a two years&apos; course as the minimum required for the degree of Ph.D.The Medical School of the University of Wales is situated at Cardiff. Botany and zoology are included in the first year&apos;s work for the degree in Medicine, and may be pursued at any one of the four University Colleges, at which also the student may proceed to a degree in Pure Science or in Arts; the more strictly Medical work is concentrated at the Medical School, where there are the appropriate departments. Anatomy and physiology may be taken at the University College at Cardiff as component parts of a degree scheme in pure science as well as of one in medicine. Medical students of the University of Wales must all take a degree in Science or Arts in con-junction with their medical degrees.Agricultural departments exist at Aberystwyth and Bangor, in which provision is made for the teaching of agricultural aspects of biological subjects, as well as for advisory and research activities. There is also an Advisory and Research Department at Cardiff&apos;, but no teaching is done by the department. Comprehensive courses are given at both Aberystwyth and Bangor leading to the Pass and Honours degrees of B.Sc, in rural science, and there is provision for post-graduate work. Some degree of differentiation is made in the work of the two centres. At Aberystwyth is the Plant Breeding Station, recognised as one of the Research Institutes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Imperial Bureau of Plant Genetics (Herbage Plants) under the Empire Marketing Board. At Bangor there is a Department of Forestry, and special attention is paid to soil chemistry.
In addition to Honours in Agriculture, Honours schemes are arranged in &quot;the pure subjects of botany and zoology, supported by agricultural botany, agricultural chemistry, agricultural zoology, and agriculture. Among these are schemes admirably adapted for the training of candidates for colonial posts as Mycologists, Entomologists, Helminthologists and Geneticists. The courses are so arranged that students trained in these subjects have a very thorough grounding in the pure sciences concerned. Cardiff also is well equipped to prepare men for colonial posts, both zoological and botanical, and Swansea for those of a botanical character.The teaching in rural science at Aberystwyth and Bangor is suitable also for preparing graduates for many other careers, including practical farming, Lecturing and organising under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Posts at Research Stations, Teaching in Secondary and Farm Schools, Advisers under County Councils, Land Agents, Positions on staffs of whole-sale or agricultural firms dealing with agricultural products.During the last few years there has been a rapid change in the outlook of educationists in relation to biology as a school subject. It is now very generally replacing pure botany in girls&apos; schools and there is evidence of its gradual introduction into boys&apos; schools. The Colleges of the University of &quot;Wales provide courses which are well ada]3ted to the end of producing fully qualified teachers of biology.Scholarships are available from several sources : (a) the Local Education Authorities; (b) State Scholarships, for which biological candidates compete with candidates in other subjects; (c) some Scholarships given by the Colleges from the income derived from endowments. There are no scholarships given by the Colleges specially for the study of zoology or botany. The maintenance grants for students-in-training given by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research are most valuable in relation to post-graduate work in the Departments of Pure Zoology and Pure Botany, as also on the applied side are the scholarships awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.The facilities already existing at the &quot;Welsh Colleges are well suited for the training of candidates for biological posts abx-oad as well as at home. The main reason that there is not a larger number of candidates for these posts at the present time is the comparative absence of biology as a subject in the boys&apos; schools. Most of the better boys on the science side come to College with some cxpertness in chemistry and physics, and it is natural for them to follow this initial bias in their degree courses. The tendency towards the pro vision of &quot; combined Honours &quot; schemes should, if it continues to develop, help those boys&apos; schools where it is desired to introduce biology into the curriculum.Apart from courses leading to degrees, the Colleges provide certain Diploma courses in biology, largely for the purpose of helping in the present difficult position of transition through which the subject is passing as an item in the school curriculum. Aberystwyth provides also a Diploma in Social Hygiene which is intended, generally speaking, for candidates of graduate standing. The course for the Diploma is provided by the co-operation of the departments of Zoology, Botany, Geography and Anthropology and Education and is arranged to occupy full-time study for -one session.  &apos;University Registry, University of Wales.(f) The Scottish Universities.The four Scottish Universities are independent bodies and each prescribes its own curricula of study. All Ordinances promoted by one University are submitted to the sister Universities before ratification, and as the regulations governing graduation in Science show considerable uniformity, it is possible to discuss the position in the Scottish Universities as a whole without reference to each individual University.Before dealing With the B.Sc. degree it may be mentioned that Biology can generally be included in the course leading to the Arts degree, either in the form of the individual subjects botany and zoology, or a combination of both (termed biology), or jointly in association with geology (termed natural science). In each case the course extends for a minimum of three terms of -about ten weeks each, and the work is divided between lectures (75), laboratoiw instruction (150 hours as a minimum) and field work.A course of the nature described above is not designed in any way to produce biologists and is intended merely to broaden the outlook of the student whose interests reside mainly in linguistic or philosophical subjects. Nevertheless, a certain number of Arts students who in this way make their first acquaintance with biology find their life interest in the subject and afterwards devote themselves to it. Such cases are rare, but they do exist and in this way good intellectual material is occasionally recruited.Naturally, the bulk of biology teaching in Scotland is found in the Faculties of Science and of Medicine, and it is sufficient to deal only with the regulations for the B.Sc. degree as, so far as the Faculty of Medicine is concerned, the conditions do not differ materially from those existing in other Universities.Preliminary Examination.All entrant candidates must be certified by the Scottish Universities Entrance Board as having passed accepted examinations in four subjects. These include (a) English, (6) a mathematical subject, (c) a classical or
modern language, (d) an additional language or a scientific subject. It isr therefore, possible to include biology (&quot; Natural Science &quot;) in the preliminary examination, although the regulations of the Entrance Board include the reasonable condition that in such a &quot;case an adequate knowledge of physics must also be certified.Courses of Study for the B.Sc. Degree.The degree of B.Sc. is conferred on two standards, Pass and Honours. In the typical course now described all candidates for Honours must complete the curriculum for the Pass Degree before proceeding to read for Honours.Pass Degree. The course, which extends over three years, is divided into (a) The First Science Examination, which includes the study of four sciences, and (ft) The Second Science Examination, in which two cognate-subjects are studied more intensively for an additional year.The following is a typical arrangement of the subjects involved : Group A. Group B.Chemistry. Botany.Physics. Zoology.Mathematics. Physiology.Applied Mathematics. Geology.Geography.All candidates must table  chemistry and physics, and must include at least one subject from Group B. In two of the Universities this choice is-restricted to one of botany or zoology.Each full course extends for three Terms and involves from 75 to 100 lectures, together with laboratory work, tutorial meetings, museum demonstrations and field work. Two years are devoted to this first part of the-curriculum.Second Science Examination. Preparation for this examination occupies the third year of the studenfs course. Two related subjects already studied up to the standard of the First Examination are studied more intensively for three Terms and, in the case of biological subjects, typical combinations-are : 1. Any two of botany, zoology, geology, chemistry, mathematics.2. Physiology, with one of chemistry, physics, zoology, botany, anatomy.,b. Anatomy, with zoologj&apos;.This completes the course for the Pass Degree of B.Sc.Honours Science Examination. Specialisation in one subject, which has-been studied up to the standard of the Second Science Examination, is con-tinued for the fourth year. As a rule, the biological subjects are divided into specialised sections and students are allowed a reasonable choice of such sub-divisions. By regulation, students must devote themselves exclusively to their Honours subject and are allowed to take another subject only when it is a necessary adjunct to the subject professed for Honours.In certain of the Universities all candidates, before coEamencing Honours, study, must have completed a course consisting of (a) literary German, (b) &quot; Scientific &quot; German, and either the degree tests or class examinations include questions set in both French and German.(Initialled)      J.
