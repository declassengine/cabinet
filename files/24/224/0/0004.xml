S DOCtJMiag 13 THS PROPfcBTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJ5 TY&apos;3 GOY^MBHT.0     A     B     I     g T.national Health Insurance and c/idows&apos; and Old Af-je Pensions.Prolongation of Insuranoe. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.It is necessary to obtain at a very early date a deoision whether an act should Tie passed to extend the Health Insurance and Contributory i-ensions rights of persons who, by reason of continuous and prolonged unemployment over a period of at least two-and-a-half years, would otherwise oease to be insured on the 31st of December next.of 193Q, and, on that occasion, the matter was considered in conjunction with the related question of the provision to be made for persons who had exhausted their insurance rights under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.     As no decision had been reached on this major question it was deoided in December 1930, in order not to prejudice the general question of principle,  to make tempox-ary emergency provision to deal with the health and pensions part of the problem, and a short ,3111 was hurriedly passed through Parliament by general consent to preserve until the 31st December, 1931, the insurance rights (both Health and Contributory Pensions) of those insured persons, estimated to be between 60,000 and 100,000 in number, who would otherwise have had those rights brought summarily to an end on the 31st jjeoember, 1930.The above Act (the Prolongation of Insuranoe Aot, 1930), expires on the 31st Deoember, 1931, and, being a 4R3T.269 (31).A similar deoision had to be taken in the autumn
I imoney Aot, cannot be continued under the  irpiring laws Act. It is now, therefore, necessary to decide whethei&quot; similar provision shall be made to continue insurance until the end of 1932, both for those persons affected by the 1930 Act who have not subsequently returned to employment and for a further small number whose insurance would be due to oease at the end of the present year, or at 30th June, 1932.The numbers affected are now estimated   at about 60,000 to 70,000 in all and the cost to the ^chequer of paying the neoessary contributions to support the Health Insurance of these persons, and to provide the related State Grant towards the cost of benefits (as was done in the 1930 Act) would be about  110,000 for the twelve months. It would not be neoessary to pay any contributions to the Pensions Account in resx^ect of these persons, but this account would have to bear the liability for pensions.The May Committee recommended that no further provision should be made for prolongation after this year, thus saving the cost involved to the ^chequer.The matter was considered by the liational -Government at the end of August and the view then taken was that it would be advisable to renew the .ict for a further year.     Eo announcement has, however, been made of this decision, the latest statement; on the subject in reply to a Question in the House of Commons on the 6th October, 1931, having been that the matter was still under consideration. In these circumstances the present Government ^HHHRBHflp consider the whole mat oar afresh, especially in view of the decision which has been reached to bring persons entitled to transitional benefit raider the Unemployment Insurance Schema within the purview of the public assistance authorities for assessment of needs though not for payment cf what may be awarded to them.
The question of prolongation has &quot;been ooneiderod by the Approved Societies Consultative Council on which 3oo;i cclna of all types are represented.     As regards prolongation for Health Insuranoo, the general view of the Council (with the sole exception of the Trade Unions)   is that they do not make any demand for extension of insurance beyond the permanent provision made by the Act of 1928, but they would raise no objection to extension, provided that the cost were met by the Exchequer as was done last year.     persons continued under prolongation are only entitled to one half the ordinary rates of Sickness and Disablement Benefit (7/6d and 3/9d a week respectively) plus Medical and Maternity Benefit.     The Friendly Societies,- in particular, are very insistent on the maintenance of a self-supporting insuranoe soheme, without any extra assistanoe from the -Exchequer, and it is pointed out that the rates of benefit are so low that recourse to the publio assistance authorities is ordinarily necessary in any oase.     Under Seat ion 105 of the National Health Insuranoe Aot, 1924, a looal authority, when granting outdoor relief, is not entitled to take into consideration as part of the income of the household any benefit under the Act whioh does not exoeed 7/6d a week.     The persons now under consideration could) therefore, on proof of need, receive the same amount of assistanoo from the publio assistanoe authorities whether their health insurance were prolonged or not, though in their oase the 7/6d allowed is not based on their contributions.As regards Pensions, there is no strong oase for special legislation in respect of Old Age Pensions, inasmuch as provision already exists for continuing the insuranoe tf persons who, having been insured for ten years, oease employment after reaching the age of 60, and are thereafter available for but unable to secure employment.
C, (This provision also secures to the old age pensionerMedioal Benefit for life under the Health Insurance Scheme).In relation to widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions, if a person1s insuranoe has oome to an end by reason of unemployment and he dies before he has again found work and requdified, there will be no provision for contributory pension for his widow and children.     On the other hand, the number of oases of aotual loss of widows&quot; and orphans1 pensions would bo extremely small, as they would be limited to oases where a person under the age of 60 had been continuously unemployed for at least two-and-a-half years and died during the next following year.It should perhaps   be stated that if it were decided to prolong for pensions purposes only, complicated administrative jorxangements.with the Approved Societies would be necessary, but suoh arrangements are not impossible.The present time of grave national  -emergency iB one in which the cessation of further prolongation of insuranoe would be most likely to be regarded generally aa justifiable.     If further prolongation were now to be grantod, it would be all but impossible to refrain from making similar provision year by year in the future9 and unless the numbor of persons affected fell to so low a figure as to be negligible, the   position would be reached that insuranoe would be continued indefinitely,, however long the period of unemployment may be.     Such a result would be undesirable in itself and would also be inconsistent with the policy steadily pursued in recent years of getting rid of all special state grants for national health insurance and leaving on the Exohequer only the statutory Exchequer contribution of a proportion of the benefits,I have myself formed the opinion that the prolongation should cease both for health benefits and pensions.     To do
otherwise is to let Health Insurance begin to go the way of Unemployment Insurance, just when, as the result of unfortunate experiences we are forced to a painful effort for the restoration of the latter.     This bracing of the system bf Insurance appears to me a very typical example of the tfork we are called upon to doft     We have to draw the line between true insurance and public assistance.     It would be a bad beginning to Smudge it heree     It may be said that this is a small matter, where a minor outlay would av/oid much political criticism^     But it is only small in that it is a beginning.     The principle to be defended is one of the foundations of solvency.     If it be departed from here, that will weaken the front where larger financial Issues are involved.\An early announcement of the intentions of the Government is necessary.     If it should be decided to prolong both Health and Pensions Insurance, the necessary legislation should bo passed through all its stages during the present month.     If Pensions rights only are to be continued, the necessary legislation (with retrospective effect from the 1st January, 1932) might, if it is thought desirable, be postponed until the early spring of next yeari(Intld.)
