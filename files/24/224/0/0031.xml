THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOYERNMENT 9 M Kmm-m.____.______,---------- ty \i (JPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1931. SECRET. Copy No.      9CP. 296 (31).(Also C.D.C. (31) 22.)CABINET.THE INTERNATIONAL AIR SITUATION AND DISARMAMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. THE Disarmament Conference is due to assemble next February, and I find that there are a number of important and intricate questions in the sphere of air disarmament on which an early decision is essential. Several of these raise fundamental issues of policy, which are outside the competence of the inter-departmental committee which has been conducting a preliminary review of the field. Accordingly, I welcome the decision taken by the Cabinet to institute a Committee to deal with Disarmament Policy.2. In the short time which has elapsed since the new Government took office, I have naturally only been able to make a preliminary examination of these issues, but, without in any way wishing to sound an alarmist note, I confess that I am considerably perturbed by the facts of the international air situation as I find them, quite apart from their implications from the point of view of disarmament. Indeed, I feel bound to bring some of the more salient features of the position to the notice of my colleagues without delay, and it is to this end that I circulate the present short memorandum.3. I venture, in the first place, to remind the Cabinet that our position in regard to air power is very similar to that in regard to sea power. With our vast oversea territories widely dispersed over the surface of the globe, we must of necessity be more dependent on air power (as we have already made far fuller use of it in Iraq, Trans-Jordan, at Aden and elsewhere) than any other nation. Moreover, the very geography of the British Empire invests the question of Imperial Air Defence with problems of peculiar difficulty. Take, for example, the position of these islands. London is but 60 miles from the coast 20 minutes&apos; flight only by types of bombing aircraft already in existence. Contrast the relative position of Paris and London, the Empire&apos;s heart, presents a far greater concentration of the nation&apos;s resources, political, financial, industrial and commercial. For instance, roughly one-sixth of the population of the United Kingdom live within the Metropolitan and City Police districts; and London is growing from year to year, whilst generally there is a trend of industry towards the South of England. Less than one-twelfth of the population of France live in Paris which is, moreover, much further inland than London. Moreover, whilst the bulk of French squadrons overseas are just across the Mediterranean in North Africa, our own air forces in Egypt, Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Iraq and India and at Malta, Aden and Singapore would be cut off completely from these islands in time of war, for they could not cross intervening neutral, much less enemy,, territory.4. I will not, in the present memorandum, elaborate further either our dependence on air power or the magnitude of the problems which confront the Air Staff as a result of such special factors as those I have instanced; both are,. I suggest, undeniable and outside the sphere of controversy. Granted these premisses, what is our position to-day in the matter of air defence ? Where do we, who have so much to gain from the air (and so much to lose if we neglect it), stand as an air Power in relation to other nations, and France in particular our nearest neighbour and the possessor of the strongest air force in the world ? What progress has been made with the modest air programme which was decided on in 1923, after exhaustive enquiry by the specially constituted Sub-Committee on National and Imperial Defence, as a first step towards providing the minimum strength requisite to &quot;protect us against air attack by the strongest Air Force [6244]
within striking distance of this country&quot; a programme, I may remind my colleagues, which has since received the endorsement of each successive Govern-ment and each successive Parliament? How does the trend of air expenditure in Great Britain compare with that in foreign countries ? These are among the questions which I have asked on returning, after a decade&apos;s absence, to the Air Ministry, and I find the answers far from satisfactory. Thus (1) Great Britain ranks to-day only fifth of the world&apos;s air Powers in terms of first-line strength;(2) The Trench air forces at present stand to our own in a ratio of nearly three to one in Europe; the world over the ratio is two to one ;*(3) The 1923 programme envisaged the formation of 52 squadrons &quot; in the first instance .... with as little delay as possible,&quot;t and it was intended to complete their formation by 1928. This initial pro-gramme has been retarded time and again, whether as a gesture of disarmament or as a measure of economy, with the result that to-day  three years after the date originally scheduled for completion only four-fifths of it have been achieved. Moreover, of the 42 squadrons now existing, 13, or all but one-third, are non-regular. Two further regular squadrons were due to form in 1932; the financial crisis has entailed their abandonment, a fact which I find has not been previously reported to the Cabinet, and which I therefore now desire to place formally on record.(4) We are to-day allocating to &quot; air &quot; (including civil aviation) a markedly smaller percentage of our national expenditure than France, Italy or the U.S.A. France, in particular, is spending on &quot; air &quot; twice as large a percentage of her National Budget as we are. Our gross air expenditure is, indeed, actually lower in 1931 than it was in 1925 it will be lower still in 1932. In striking contrast, Air Estimates in the U.S.A. and France have been climbing steeply year by year, and have more than doubled since 1925.These few but significant facts and figures, which I have selected at random from the mass of material before me, suffice for my immediate purpose and I will not, at this stage, prolong the tale. I have merely felt that they are sufficiently disquieting to warrant indeed to necessitate my drawing my colleagues&apos; attention to them.I hope, shortly, to be in a position to lay before the Committee on Disarma-ment Policy a fuller appreciation of the problem of air disarmament with concrete recommendations by the Air Staff as to the course of action we should adopt at Geneva. For the moment I confine myself to saying that I fully endorse the conclusions formulated by my predecessor in the late Labour Cabinet, which I may restate, in summarised form, as follows : (1) We are bound to claim at Geneva full theoretical parity with the world&apos;s strongest air power leaving it, of course, as an issue of domestic policy to what extent we translate that claim into concrete reality; (2) The moderation perhaps the excessive moderation of British air policy for years past has placed us in a position of such serious disparity that the only hope of effective air disarmament lies in persuading the French to reduce drastically their present overwhelming air forces.L.Air Ministry, November 26, 1931.* The actual figures of first-line strength are as follows: (a) &quot;Metropolitan,&quot; i.e., British Isles ami France, exclusive of Fleet Air Arm France       .. .. .. .. 1,210Great Britain .. .. .. ..      436(b) The world over France       ..        ... .. .. 1,667Great Britain . . . . .. ..      838For purposes of the Disarmament Conference the figure for Great Britain is reduced from 838 to 7-12 by the exclusion of units in India, which has a separate quota.t I quote from the announcement made by the then Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 20th June, 1923.
