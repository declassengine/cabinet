Pressure is being exerted upon us in the House and else-where to issue instructions to Public Assistance Authorities that certain types of resources at the disposal of applicants for transitional payments should be uniformly  disregarded in determining the question whether they are in need of transitional payments.      In particular the request is made with regard to the pensions of disabled ex-service men.     A statenent on the policy will have to be made on behalf of the Government in Debate this week, by the Minister of Labour.2o     By the Unemployment Insurance (National Economy)  (No.2) Order,  1931, made under the National Economy Act, persons who have exhausted their insurance benefit or have drawn 156 days benefit in a year may apply for transitional payments.      The questions whether they need such payments, and to what extent,  are -    --investigated and decided by the Public Assistance Authorities in accordance with their practice in dealing with the case ofThe decision of the Public Assistance Authority is final.    The Order in Council only came into -operation on the 12th November, and the Public Assistance Authorities have scarecely begun work upon it,  so that the requests are in advance of knowledge of the results of the Order.3.      The principle of public assistance is to examine the individual circumstances of an applicant and to give relief according to need.     Need will vary not only with the personalcircumstances of each applicant, but also with variations in the local standard of living, level of rents,  etc.     Naturally, therefore,  the rates of relief and allowances adopted by Public Assistance Authorities vary considerably throughout the country.unemployed able-bodied persons
*?&apos; o ^It follows that variety&apos;- of treatment from area to ares is to he expected also in regard to transitional payments.4.     In Cap., 250 (1931) of the 2nd October,  in submitting the Order in Council to the Cabinet,  the Minister of labour called attention to the variety of practice inherent in public assistance administration, particularly in the following paragraphs-&quot;The Public Assistance Authority in each area will take into account everything which they would take into account in one of their own cases,  and to such extent as is their present practice. The existing practice of Authorities varies considerably, not only from area to area, but also according to the circumstances and needs of each case.      Any departure from the principle of leaving the assessment of need and the method of making it in the hands of the Local Authority would quickly involve the Minister of Labour in the issue of regulations having far-reaching effects upon the administration of Public Assistance,  and in the creation of a &apos;national scale of maintenance5  and a second Poor Law&quot;. 5.      The scheme was drafted so as to place the final responsibility for determination in the case of transitional payments in the hands of the Public Assistance Authorities,  on the basis of the standard that they would apply to an. application for public Assistance.      It was made clear in GoPo260(3l)  that although the cost of the transitional payments granted by Public Assistance Authorities would fall upon central funds, the Minister of Labour was deliberately refraining in the Order in Council from taking powers to issue uniform instructions with which Authorities would have to comply.      The dangers of exposing the Minister to demands for interference in particular cases and of seeking to combine uniform instructions with the use of the local stnadards and practice of Public Assistance Authorities were set out in G,pc260(51) and CP, 211(31) .So     The present position both in regard to disability pensions andsavings is illustrated by a Question and Answer given by the Ministerof Labour on the 19th November,  a circular to Local Authorities, (L^A.3) ,which was considered and approved by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Home Secretary,   the Secretary of State for Scotland,  and theMinisters of Health and Labour,  and a circular issued by the Minister2.
If Health -under the Labour Government in 1930.      Copies of these arg g faleached.The practice of Local Authorities with regard to disability pensions s not uniform,  any more than it is uniform on other incomings into the ousehold.      In a number of areas it appears to be usual,  in assessing te means of the applicant,  to disregard the first 7s.6d of a pension in he same way as the first 7s.6d of Health Insurance benefit is required Hy Statute to be disregarded.     This does not mean an automatic deduction jfrom any relief that would be granted,  of all pension in excess of 7s.6d. Authorities recognise that while a man may have a disability pension he Iso has a disability need.      Other Authorities &quot;take into account&quot;&apos; the hole of the disability pension, but this does not mean that they ecessarily deduct the whole of it from the relief that would otherwise ie paid.      It is likely that in the result to the disabled man there is ore uniformity than the variation of nominal practice would suggest...   At the same time it cannot be denied that there will be cases of variation of treatment for disabled ex-service men,  as for others,  according to the area in which they live and the standard adopted by the Authority for that area.Since the passing of the Order in Council one or two Public Assistance jhuthorities who have previously disregarded the first 7s.Sd of disability pension have announced their intention of disregarding the first 15s of the pension in the case of applicants for transitional payments, while ^maintaining the lower figure for applicants for public assistance.    Such  ction is illegal under the Order in Council,  and it is probable that as Authorities realise that the introduction of a difference between their practice on transitional payments and on public assistance is illegal, they will modify their proposals.      One example of the proposed illegality is that of the Monmouthshire Public Assistance Committee. 8.     The problem of disability pensions in relation to means arose previously in connection with extended benefit.    The Minister of Labour had power to lay down rules with regard to claims for extended benefit from persons who had exhausted their standard benefit, end- in 1926 heIdecided,  and laid it down in the instructions to Local Employment Committees,   that where the claimant for extended benefit was himself the Recipient of a disability pension,  the whole of that pension should be taken into account as part of the family incomings for the purpose of Welding whether or not he needed ex j-epded benefit.
*) O QA* 0 ty9.      As indicated, earlier the request for uniform instructions ahout disability pensions cannot be treated by itself0    As the Minister of health has no power under the Poor Lav Act to issue statutory instructions to Public Assistance Authorities with regard to the amount of assistance to be given to any applicant for public assistance and the Minister of Labour has no powers to issue such instructions with regard to transitional payments, new legislation will be necessary for the powers to be obtainedc    If legislation dealing only with disability pensions is introduced numerous additional requests will be made, and   it will be very difficult to confine its scope to the original intention.    If a concession is proposed for ex-service disability pensions, there is no reason in equity why it should not be applied to cases of industrial disability covered by Workmen&apos;s Compensation.  If special miles are to be made about incomings into the household from these two sources, it will be very difficult to refuse to make them about other types of resources,  such as ownership of the house where the applicant lives, investments in Co-operative Societies, war savings certificates, lost Office Savings Banks,  etc.  and if grants of public money at the full scale are to be made to persons who have such resources, it is difficult to see what meaning will be left in the principle of the Order, or indeed what economies can be expected from its administration.It must be remembered also that whatever is done for transitional payments must also be done for public assistance.  It is not only that the Order in Council would require this, but it would be clearly unjust, for example,  to treat disabled ex-service men who happen to have been insured contributors and are thus entitled to apply for transitional payments, differently in regard to their needs from non-insured ex-servi.ee men, such as small
9 0flh.) kji \Jshopkeepers or agricultural labourers, who have been forced to apply to Public Assistance Authorities for relief.Moreover, allowances in respect of particular types of income are not the only things that matter.    There is, at least equally important,  the rate or scale of public assistance.    A demand, will quickly arise for uniformity in the rates of   public assistance. If, for example,  ex-service men;s pensions were to be treated uniformly they v/ould probably be all the more indignant when they found that, notwithstanding this,  the amount of transitional payments or public assistance granted varied according to the area in which they lived.10.      There is a further point of some importance.    In their Terms of Reference the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance have to consider what is to be done for unemployed persons who are capable of,  and available for, work but have either exhausted their insurance rights or are not within the insurance scheme.    The scheme of transitional payments was based upon the existing practice of Public Assistance Authorities in dealing with unemployed able-bodied applicants for public assistance and upon their administration, among other reasons as an interim measure which would not disturb the situation while the Royal Commission were reaching a considered judgment.    Any departure from the existing practice would be bound to have consequences for the Royal Commission.11.      To sum up:(1) Variations in local practice are inseparable from a scheme of administration through local Public Assistance Committees.(2) Under the Order in Council neither the Minister of Health nor the Minister of Labour has any power to issue binding-instructions upon Local Authorities.    If such instructions are required new legislation will be necessary.
-      9 n(3) The Minister of Labour has issued circulars with the agreement of the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland on the lines of those previously issued by the Minister of Health for public assistance.(4)  So far as disabled ex-service men are concerned,  there is no reason at all to think that Public Assistance Authorities are unlikely to administer in a sympathetic manner a grant of money which the i^chequer,  and not the rates, will have to pay. Their general practice indicates that while they are clearly bound to ascertain the wdiole of the disability pension and to enter it as incoming into tho household,  in calculating the need of the apolicant they do not regard the whole of the pension as means which must be automatically deducted from the scale of payment they would be otherwise required to give. 12.      In these circumstances we are both of the opinion that the Government should stand by the decision they deliberately took in October, a decision which incidentally was before the electorate.    If we hold our ground about disability pensions there is little reason to doubt but that we can hold out against other requests.      If we give way at all,  even as regards disability pensions, v/e must have legislation, and once weopen the legislative door, we shall not be able to restrict the proposals to this one point;    we shall quickly be facedwith the necessity of trying to improvise at short notice a new public assistance code for the relief of all able-bodied unemployed persons.23rd November, 1931.

Captain Sir WILLIAM BRASS asked the Minister of Labour (1) whether his attention has been called to the administration of the means test for unemployed persons    in certain parts of Lancashire; and whether he will issue an order making it quite clear to the public assistance committees that only the income of      the        assets held shall be taken into account and that the realisation of such assets is not necessary before imemployment benefit can be granted.(2) whether he will consider    issuing special instructions to the public assistance committees who are to assess unemployment benefit urier the means test with the object of impressing upon them that
disability pensions were granted for disabilities, and that the disabled unemployed who  is in greater need as a result of his disablement shall not have his pension taken into account when-assessing the amount of the benefit to be paid, him? 34.     Mr. SOPSR asked the Minister of Labour whether his attention has been drawn to the difficulties encountered by public assistance committees in applying the means test to persons whose savings have not been invested in interest-bearing securities; and will he take steps to see that a ruling is given governing these cases in such a way that thrift is not penalised?Sir H. BETTEETOH:    I have no authority under the Order-in-Council governing transitional payments to give instructions to local authorities as to the manner in which the resources of an applicant for transitional payments should be taken into account,,      I have, however,  in consultation with any right hon.Friends, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland issued to all authorities a circular drawing their attention to certain considerations which may be properly borne in mind in determining the needs of applicants who are in possession of assets such as house property, or invested savings or are in receipt of certain classes of income such as disability pensions.

Questions have been raised by a number of Local Authorities as to the lines upon which they should proceed in determining the needs of applicants for transitional payments who are in possession of assets such as house property or invested savings or in receipt of certain classes of income such as disability pensions. The Minister now wishes to communicate for the general information of Authori-ties the following extract from a letter which he has caused to be sent to Authorities who have raised these questions.2. The Minister has no power to vary the terms of the Order in Council which requires a Committee or Sub-Committee in deter-mining any question referred to them to make such enquiries and otherwise deal with the case as if they were estimating the need of an unemployed ablebodied person who had applied for public assistance.3. The Minister understands that it is one of the essential prin-ciples of the administration of Public Assistance that Authorities should deal with cases according to their individual circumstances, and the Explanatory Memorandum of 17th October, 1931, indicated some considerations which should properly be taken into account in applying these principles to the classes of applicants for transi-tional payments.4. The Minister has no authority under the Order in Council to give instructions as to the manner in which the resources of an applicant represented by the capital value of a house or of invested savings should be taken into account, nor indeed would such in-structions be appropriate to the individual treatment of each case on its merits. In general it would be right to take account of these resources to some extent at least before transitional payments at the expense of the National Exchequer could be authorised. It should be appreciated that the Order in Council requires the applicant to prove that he is in need of assistance by way of tran-transitional payments, and it would be difficult to reconcile with this requirement a practice of recommending transitional payments to
an unemployed person in possession of assets irrespective of the general circumstances of the case. But conditions may exist in which the enforced realisation of assets would be an unreason-able requirement and in those cases it would not be improper for the Public Assistance Committees, while taking full account of the income value of such resources, to recommend the grant of transitional payments for the time being.5. There is no&quot; authority for the statement that Public Assis-tance Committees are obliged to bring into account the whole amount of an ex-service pension or disability pension. In reply to questions on this point the Minister has referred to the state-ment made in a circular enclosed in circular No. 1097 of 28th March, 1930, addressed to Public Assistance Committees in England and Wales : &apos; In assessing the amount of relief to be afforded the general principle is that income and means from every source available to the household must be taken into account subject to the statutory exceptions contained in section 76 of the Poor Law Act, 1927. It should, however, be remembered that where certain classes of income are concerned, such, for example, as disability pensions or blind pensions, the disability in respect of which the pension has been awarded may be such as to call for a greater measure of assistance than would normally be appro-priate.Again, it is proper that the earnings of widows and children should be taken into account when relief is assessed, but it would be reasonable not to deduct the whole amount of such earnings from the relief which would have been afforded had the earnings not existed.&apos; 6. The Minister understands that this is in accordance with the usual practice in Scotland.&quot;T. W. PHILLIPS,Deputy Secretary,Ministry of Labour.(12581-8)   Wt. 17IS3-651G  10,000 11/31  P.

Circular 1069.Boards of Guardians.Ministry of Health,Whitehall, S.W. 1. 3rd January, 1930.ADMINISTRATION OF  OUTDOOR RELIEF.Sm,I am directed by the Minister of Health to state that there are certain points in regard to the administration of the poor law to which he would desire to direct the speciai attention of the Guardians during the winter months which have still to elapse before the transfer of functions under the Local Government Act. The successful oper-ation of the poor law depends in an eminent degree upon the spirit in which the statutes and orders are administered by those locally responsible. Within the ambit of their powers Boards of Guardians have a measure of discretion under those statutes and orders which affords them scope for full and sympathetic consideration of individual -dual needs.Tho particular points which the Minister has in mind are concerned with the administration of outdoor relief. It should be clearly understood that the Minister fully appreciates the soundness of affording institutional relief in appropriate cases, but it has to be admitted that the facilities for affording this form of relief are in many areas insufficient.On general questions of principle, the Minister thinks that he may appropriately on the present occasion direct the attention of Guardians to the Circular of the 18th March. 1910, issued by the Local Government Board on the Recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress, and in particular to the extracts which are appended to this Circular (Appendix No. 1) for convenience of reference.There are, in addition, certain specific points to which the Ministers attention has been drawn in the course of administration and on which he desires to offer observations for the guidance of Boards of Guardians.1. It has been brought to his notice that certain Boards of Guardians have made a practice of excluding, either from the grant of outdoor relief, or even from the grant of any relief at all, certain cate-gories of persons, such for example as single men, able-bodied men as distinct from their families, or persons who have been on relief for long periods. The Minister recognises that the mere bidk of the problem with which the Guardians are confronted may create a tendency to adopt such rough and ready methods of classification. It is true that they may be intended merely for the guidance of4/1/30.   3533.   Wt. 2091/150.   2,500.   4/SO.   Wy. &amp; S., Ltd.   Qp. 2.33-9999
relief committees, and may permit in doubtful cases of reference to the full Board or a revision committee who have power to disregard the general rules.   The fact, however, remains that such rules tend to become too rigid in their application and the Minister desires to point but that a general refusal of outdoor relief to particular classes without regard to individual circumstances is contrary to one of the first principles of poor law administration, which requires that each case must be considered on its merits, and that a general refusal of any form of relief is contrary to the established duty of the Guardians to relieve destitution where they are satisfied that it exists.   Where destitution is found to exist, it rests with the Guardians to decide on the appropriate form of relief, but in coming to that decision they should be guided by the needs of the individual household, and not automatically by rule.In particular, the Minister most strongly deprecates the practice adopted in a few unions of ignoring the able-bodied man when assess-ing the grant of relief to his family, with the inevitable result, where no other resources are present, that the man shares, and thereby renders inadequate, the means of subsistence of the household.2. The requirement of test work prescribed by the Relief Regu-lation Order, 1911, has an obvious bearing on the grant of relief to the able-bodied. As the Minister has stated in Parliament, he is at present making enquiry into the conditions under which test work is now being performed, and it may be necessary for him to com-municate further with Boards of Guardians on this subject. In the meantime, however, he desires to define his position in regard to the application of test work in the terms of a reply which he recently gave in the House of Commons.&quot; While I am opposed to the wholesale application of test work to men who are unfortunately in the position of being unable to obtain work, I am of opinion that Boards of Guardians must have some means, other than the offer of the House, for dealing with the limited class whom they know to be undeserving of unconditional relief. In my view test work should, as far as possible, be adapted to the training and educating of men so that they may be fitted to take on a new job when one offers.&quot;3. With regard to children to whom it may be necessary to grant outdoor relief, the Minister would refer the Guardians in particular to the following extracts from the Circular issued by the Local Govern-ment Board on the 16th June, 1910 : &quot; When a child is living with its parent, the latter must naturally be regarded as primarily responsible for its welfare, but if the Guar-guardians give relief to the parent they are bound to see that the relief is properly applied and that the child is not neglected. If the conditions of the house are open to serious objection from a mora or sanitary point of view, the Guardians must take care that by the grant of relief they do not encourage the continuance of the children
in such surroundings. In giving relief, the Guardians should remember that where children are concerned it is especially important that care should be taken to secure that the relief is adequate and of the kind that is most appropriate to the necessities of the case.&quot;*      *      *&quot;mothers&quot; (that is to say widowed mothers) &quot;should not be expected to earn unless satisfactory arrangements can be made for the children,&quot;4. In assessing the amount of relief to be afforded the general principle is that income and means from every source available to the household must be taken into account, subject to the statutory exceptions contained in section 76 of the Poor Law Act, 1927. It should, however, be remembered that where certain classes of income are concerned, such, for example, as disability pensions or blind pensions, the disability in respect of which the pension has been awarded may be such as to call for a greater measure of assistance than would normally be appropriate.Again, it is proper that the earnings of widows and children should be taken into aecoimt when relief is assessed, but it would be reasonable not to deduct the whole amount of such earnings from the relief which would have been afforded had the earnings not existed.5. As the Guardians are aware the question of vagrancy is under consideration by a special committee. The committee is not yet in a position to report, but a letter, of which a copy is enclosed (Appendix No. 2), has been addressed to the Minister by the Chairman on behalf of the Committee. The Minister would strongly commend the points raised in this letter to the special and early consideration of the Guardians concerned.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,The Clerk to the Guardians.
APPENDIX No. 1.Extracts from Circular Letter of 1 Stli March, 1910. The Grant of Relief.The State has imposed upon the Guardians of the Poor the duty of relieving the destitute, and in order to enable them to discharge this duty has em-powered them to expond funds contributed from the Imperial taxes or raised from the local rates ; but the State has also imposed conditions which control and limit this expenditure. The funds in the hands of the Guardians arc raised compulsorily, and not by voluntary contributions, and they are there -fore not in a position to dispense charity at will.Relief from public funds may only be given within the limits prescribed by the law, and the law as it at present stands limits such relief to cases of destitu-tion. The Guardians are entrusted with the task of deciding upon the evidence before them whether a particular person whose case, is under consideration is or is not destitute ; and in determining this question they have to remember that a person may be destitute in respect of the w-ant of some particular neces-sity of life without being destitute in all respects ; as, for instance, a person who is not destitute in the sense that he is entirely devoid of the means of subsistence, may yet be destitute in that ho is unable to provide for himself the particular form of medical attendance or treatment of which he is in urgent need.Moreover, the relief given should be of such a nature that, while it meets the needs of the recipient, it is also in accordance with the interests of the community at large. It is obviously not in accordance with the interests of the community that the amount or description of the relief granted should be such as either to discourage the recipient from striving to regain his inde-pendence, or to induce others who are still independent to relax their efforts to maintain their present position.* *       *General Principles Governing Out-door Belief.* *      *The Commissioners have indicated that in their judgment insufficient inquiry into the circumstances of applicants is the chief cause of the defects on which they lay most stress.   These defects are : (1) the grant of out-door relief which is inadequate, because it does not sufficiently meet the actual necessities of the case ; (2) the giving of indiscriminate or unconditional out-door relief ; and (3) the lack of uniformity in the principles on which out-door relief is administered.It is clear that the first point to be observed in a proper and businesslike administration of relief is that the Guardians should endeavour to acquire a complete knowledge of the circumstances and needs of the applicant, and should inform themselves, by every means in their power, of the resources of the applicant, so that they may be in a position to form a considered judg-ment as to the necessities of the case and the right mode of dealing with it.It is only by such careful inquiry that the Guardians will be enabled to determine whether the case is a suitable one for out-door relief, and, if so, what amount and form of relief should be given.While the question whether out-door relief should be given rather than in-door relief, in other words, whether the persons to whom relief or assistance must be given &quot; can, with most advantage to the community, continue to &quot; live at home,&quot; may present some difficulty in particular cases, it is essential that the grant of out-door relief should be regulated by principles based on a sound public policy.   The practice of giving indiscriminate and unconditional
out-door relief has been generally condemned. As the Commissioners say &quot; no possible justification can be advanced for the granting of out-relief &quot; in such a way as to perpetuate pauperism and the evil conditions which give &apos;&apos;riso to pauperism.&quot; Again, if out-door relief is given indiscriminately it may often be &quot;applied to subsidise dirt, disease, and immorality.&quot; Upon the Guardians devolves the arduous and responsible duty of exercising a wise discrimination in each case which comes before them so as to ensuro that any relief which they may decide to grant shall bo subject to such conditions as will check the supply of future pauperism.&quot;When out-door relief is given it should be carefully adapted to tho needs of tho case and adequate in amount. The Board regret that it is sometimes the practice to get rid of an applicant by giving him a small amount of relief, which on the face of it is insufficient for his support, on the assumption that he has other resources available which have not been declared. The injustice of such a method is evident, for if the applicant is honest the relief given is not onough for his proper support, while if he can successfully conceal his means of subsistence he may get more than he actually needs. &quot; It is the plain duty &quot; of the Guardians to take precautions to ensuro that the relief is adequate, &quot; and that the pauper is sufficiently fed, clothed, and lodged.&quot; The Guardians will, of course, realise that a mere increase of the amount of money granted as relief does not necessarily ensure that these requirements will be fulfilled.There should also be a close and careful supervision of all cases in which out-door relief is granted. It is most important to realise that when relief has once been given the case should not be left without this supervision, as the circumstances of the recipients of relief vary no less than those of other persons, and the variation may result either in relief being continued when there is no need for it, or, on the othor hand, in hardship to the individual from the relief being insufficient or inappropriate. It is for this reason that the Board pro-pose to prohibit the continuous grant of relief for long periods, and thus to abolish what is known as the permanent list of persons who receive continuous out-door relief without a frequent reconsideration of their circumstances.*       *       *These conditions of out-door relief are, it may be noted, in effect endorsed by every member of the Boyal Commission. The authors of the Minority Beport state them as follows : &quot; There must be, in each case dealt with, an accurate ascertainment, first &quot; of the particular needs of the applicant, and, second, of the economic &quot; sanitary and other circumstances of the household. There must be, further, &quot; in each case, an impartial judgment, upon uniform principles, whether, on &quot; the ascertained facts, relief or treatment in the home is necessary and, &quot; desirable, and if so, to what extent. Finally, if the relief is not to become, &quot; in many cases, demoralising to the recipient, and injurious to the community &quot; as a whole, there must be imposed and enforced conditions as to the manner &quot; in which the publicly subsidised household shall be maintained, appropriate &quot; to the needs of each case.&quot;It is of course necessary that in the administration of out-door relief the Orders in force in the union should be observed ; but no Orders or directions of the Central Authority can of themselves ensure a good administration of out-door relief. This must depend on the manner and the spirit in which the Guardians carry out their duties. The Board trust, therefore, that the Guard -ians will earnestly endeavour to make the administration of public relief within their union conform to the principles to which their attention has now been drawn.
APPENDIX No. 2.Depabtmentai Committee on the Relief of the Casual Poor.21st December, 1929.Dear Sm,The Committee appointed by you on the 26th September last, to enquire into the administration of the laws relating to the relief of the casual poor, has held twenty-one meetings, has taken much evidence and visited certain Poor Law and other -Institutions. The Committeo has arranged to receive evidence from a number of other witnesses and is not at present in a position to present an interim report.The Committee, however, has, when examining witnesses, found that there are certain defects in the present administration which are inconsistent with the Regulations contained in the Casual Poor (Relief) Order, and with the spirit and intention of the Order, as explained in the Ministers circular issued on the 31st March, 1925. The Committee think it only right to call your attention to these defects without in any way anticipating particular recom-mendations in their final report.The main defects are : That in certain wards casuals are at present required to sleep without mattresses on concrete floors or on wire beds so constructed that the wire causes acute discomfort; that in contravention of Article 16 of the Order in certain wards two men are accommodated in cells designed for the use of a single occupant; that in certain wards the casuals are left in darkness for periods exceeding ten hours ; that there is frequently lack of decency in serving meals by reason, for instance, of the entire absence of knives and spoons ; that, despite the permission granted in the footnote to the dietary described in the Third Schedule of the Order, there is generally a lack of vegetables other than potatoes in the midday meal, and in certain wards there is a complete lack of variety in the liquid diet supplied, although the provisions of the Schedule above-mentioned allow the Guardians a choice between the supply of tea, cocoa, broth or gruel ; that there is in certain wards neglect to ensure the bathing of all casuals or the provision of a clean shirt and a clean towel for each casual; that there is generally an absence of toilet facilities, e.g., for shaving, boot-cleaning and the washing and repairing of clothes ; that there is very commonly an absence of opportunity for the exer-cise and occupation of casuals on Sunday, and in many wards an entire failure to provide newspapers, journals and books.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,L.
