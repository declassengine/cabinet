3JHIS TJOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS RRITLiHHIO 11AJESTY&apos;SG-OVEPIPaa-T&apos;!.SECRET; C,F. 287(31).Copy Ho.C A B I K.E T.AGRICULTURAL POLICY.PROPObAh FOR A BRITISH ^HEaT vj,UOT.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of;Agriculture and Fisheries.1.I am firmly convinced that, in view of the pressure of public opinion, both in the House and outside, it isessential that an announcement covering at all events ourcereal policy and if possible the question of luxury imports should be made before the House rises for the recess;I propose to deal in this memorandum only with thegoverning principles of a cereal policy.3. The need for action to remedy the depression from which arable farming in Great Britain has auffered since the generalfall of commodity prices began in 1922, has become acute duringthe past two years owing mainly to the catastrophic fall in the price of wheat and other cereals.4.    The result has been not only a serious reduction in the area under the plough, but a general loss of efficiency in the districts concerned due to lack of confidence, exhaustion of capital and inability to secure further credit.     Moreover, apart from an actual total loss of employment, there is now much more partial employment in the industry than formerly.5.    But it is not arable farming alone that has sustained the shock.      The turnover to milk production which seemed to afford &apos;an escape from the severity of world competition in cereal production, has now gone too far and has created a crisis in the marketing of milk in Scotland as well as in England.6,    I recognise, of course, that the restoration of agriculture cannot be effected by any single remedy.      Consideration must be given to the further development of stock farming, of egg
and dressed-poultry production, of fruit growing for canning and jam-malting, and of   pig production for bacon.     Such developments can go far, in association with quality-standardisation and efficient organisation of producers, to revitalise and modernise both production and marketing, but they necessarily take many years to prpduco their full results.7.     We have no alternative, I think, but to turn our attentipn at once to the wheat crop,    which occupies a key position in arable farming in England, and is, for the most part, the chief cash crop in the rotation.     It Is only by ensuring to wheat growers an adequate and stable price thatit will be possible to rectify the disturbed balance of agricultural production and to create the right atmosphere In which tc work out and apply a progressive policy.8C     The most efficient instrument for this purpose is some form of the wheat quota system which has been widely adapted.-- In other countries and offers a means of safeguarding the position of home wheat gronors while permitting flnur-millers and consumers to reap full advantage from imported wheat delivered   tn the United Kingdom, as much of it is at present, at less than its economic cost.9.     The problem of devising a workable plan was investigated by my predocessor in 1930, in cpnsultatipn with the various interests concerned.     A scheme was thendrawn up which was regarded   as administratively practicable and did not involve the imposition gf a Customs duty nn either wheat or flpur or any   contribution from the Exchequer by way of subsidy.2.
*     10..     Subject to certain--modifications, I am satisfied that such a scheme meets the requirements oi the situation,    It-loas the. advantages that it:-(a) avoids uneconomic transport of .vheut from one part of the country to another,(b) encourages prod\iction for quality and ensures reforms in marketing,   ,(c) ensures fair-play between home-millers and flour-importers,(d) preserves the status quo as between port and country millers,(e) provides an effective check against the speculative &quot;cornering&quot; of supplies,(f) leaves tho trade free to manufacture and import special brands and types of flour as at present,(g) docs not interfere with the export or re-export of flour or with the re-export of whe^t.11.     The quota ano. a national marketing organisation (which is an essential feature of the scheme) will together effectively guar-ntee to British wheat growers a pr^ne which would closely approximate to a maximum figure to be specified in the nece ,.sary legisl-t ion.    The precise figure is still under consideration, but I suggest that in order to secure a better balance of farming and to provide increased employ-ment, our aim should be to recover some of the wheat acreage lost in the exceptional conditions of recent years, subject to safeguards against undue expansion.12.     Tho cost of the premium which the quota is designed to secure for the grower must fall on the product and,  in the ultimate analysis, on the consumer of flour and bread,    I desire to put this question of principle quite fairly before my colleagues.    What it amounts to is this A quota of 15 per cent,  and a premium of 15/- per quarter for British wheat should not add more than Q.l2d. to the production cost of the 2 lb loaf, and a quota of 20 per cent,  (which is about the maximum ever likel; to be reached) and a premium of 15/- would not add more than 0,16d. These figures, moreover, put tho cost in tho worst light, for exporting oountries cannot afford to go on producing wheat at present low prices. As world prices rise,  so the burden on the consumer, due to the quota, will fall.    I suggest to my colleagues that,  in present financial circumstances,  it is eminently reasonable that the variable premium on
British wheat should be distributed over the cost of flour and oread.13*   I have discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Scotland and if my colleagues approve of the principle, I desire to have the authority of the Cabinet to announce in the House of Commons that the Government has approved of a wheat quota as a measure of Immediate assistance to arable farming, and will put proposals before Parliament with a view to the scheme being   in operation in time for the harvest of 1S32*     If this authority is given, I will then have the modified scheme discussed in letail with the representative organisations interested. When this stage is completed - and no time must be lost - I will lay the results before the Cabinet in the form of a draft Bill.14,   In view of the relatively greater Importance of barley to arable farmers in Scotland, I feel that in any announcement that I may make I should be authorised to say that It is the intention of the Government to deal with barley as well as wheat, if not concurrently then as soon as a practicable scheme can bo devised and if not by a quota then in some other way.(Intldc)   JoGostry of Agriculture and Fisheriesa
