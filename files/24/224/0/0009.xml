C RE T\ 274 (51)COPY HQ.   CjC A B I N 3 T.FORESTALLING.Mefflorandu-.!i &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.In accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet, we have carefully exanined the available evidence as to the amount of importation at present going on.This evidence consists of daily returns prepared by the Board of Customs and Excise of the imports of non-dutiable wholly or mainly manufactured articles into  -;^reports of London and Harwich during the months of October and November 1930 and 1931.      To these two ports come some 40^ of the total imports of the class mentioned, but vie are endeavouring to obtain particulars from other ports as certain trades are not carried on to any great extent  through London and Harwich,Examination of the figures at present before us shows that the month of October revealed no very marked difference as compared with October 1930.     The opening dgcys of November,however, though the period is too short for final conclusions, do appear to show a marked increase in the value of the goods entering this country.     This increase appears to be pretty general, but we subjoin the particulars of a few typical classifications.

It might easily grow to much more alarming dimensions if not checked, and since the House will be rising in the course of a few   weeks we think it desirable that the Government should ask Parliament at the earliest possible moment to arm it with the necessary powers to deal with abnormal importation as and when it occurs.we suggest that the powers should take the   following form.      The Board of Trade with the consent    of      the /
Treasury should he empowered to impose by Order a duty not within Class 3 manufactured and mainly manufactured articles)  of the Import List, if satisfied that goods ofthat kind are being imported in abnormal quantities.    TheOrder, though taking effect at once, should presumablybe subject to confirmation by resolution of the House ofCommons within,  say,  four weeks if the House is sittingat the time the Order is made,  or within four weeks of itsreassembly if it is not.      The Bill should also contain a provision enabling Orders to be varied or revoked, andit would no doubt be neQeasary to Include machinery provisions dealing with such matters as the basis of valuation.exceeding joo-percent cent, ad valorem on anyany kind of goods fallingwe would also suggest that,  as we are talcingthese powers to deal with a temporary situation, the Act,and all Orders made under it,shouldId expire atthe end of twelve months from thepassage of the Act.(Intd.) N.C.11th November,1931,
