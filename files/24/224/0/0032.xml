REPORT.-INTRODUCTORY.(a) Composition and Terms of Reference.1. At their 6th meeting (E.A.C./6th Meeting, Conclusion 6) held on tjie 10th July, 1930, the Economic Advisory Council, approved the appointment of a Committee with the following terms of reference: &quot; To consider the question of migration from the United Kingdom to oversea parts of the Empire in its economic aspects (a) in the immediate future, and (b) over a longer period, and to advise whether Government action to stimulate such migration is economically or otherwise desirable.&quot;2.   The Committee is constituted as follows :  Viscount Astor (Chairman). Professor A. M. Carr-Saunders. Mr. G. D. H. Cole.Captain L. F. Ellis, C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C. Mr. Christopher Tumor.Mr. A. P. Hemming, C.B.E., Joint Secretary, Economic Advisory CouncilMr. W. J. Garnett, Oversea Settlement DepartmentJoint Secretaries to the Committee.(b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.3. On the 22nd July, 1930, we held a preliminary meeting for the purpose of laying down the procedure to be followed in our inquiry in order to inform ourselves generally of the nature of the problems to be studied. We decided, in the first instance, to obtain from the Departments concerned written evidence regarding the policy hitherto followed in regard to migration. We accordingly invited the Oversea Settlement Department to furnish us with evidence on the general lines which their policy had followed, and the Ministry of Labour to furnish us with evidence on the migration work undertaken by that Department in connection with the relief of unemployment and, in particular, in regard to the methods adopted for recruiting for migration and for the training of migrants. We further invited the Treasury to give us their views on the financial aspects of migration, and the Colonial Office on the possibility of extending white settlement in the Crown Colonies and other British Territories.4. At an early stage of our inquiry we realised the importance of the problem of land settlement in this country, and we obtained evidence on this subject from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who explained their proposals for extending existing facilities for land settlement.5. From the official evidence referred to in paragraph S, we were much impressed by the importance of the migration work undertaken by voluntary associations; and we arranged to obtain oral evidence from the Salvation Army and the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association. On the question of the migration of women and juveniles, we received evidence respectively from the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women and from the Child Emigration Society. Oral evidence was also furnished to us by the British Legion in regard to the training of families, and by the Department of Immigration and Colonisation of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the settlement work undertaken by that Company.
6. Finally, we received oral or written evidence from a number of persons possessing special experience of one or other aspect of migration.7. We held twelve meetings for the purpose of taking oral evidence. A full list of witnesses is given in Appendix I to this Report. In addition, we were furnished with memoranda on particular points by the Oversea Settlement Department, the Home Office, the Scottish Office, and the Empire Marketing Board. We also received from various sources a number of other written communications.8. We desire to place on record our indebtedness to all who have assisted us in our inquiry, whether by giving oral evidence before us or by furnishing memoranda.(c) Arrangement of Report.9. At the time when, in October last, the Imperial Conference met, we were still engaged in the taking of evidence. We were not then in a position to submit any final conclusions, but we prepared, for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, an Interim Beport, dealing with certain aspects of migration, indicating such conclusions as we had been able to reach, some of wThich appeared to us germane to the discussions that were likely to take place at the Imperial Conference. In order to bring together the whole of our conclusions in the compass of a single document, we have incorporated in the Report which we now submit such parts of our Interim Beport as were not specially directed to the discussions at the Imperial Conference.10. The subject we are directed to consider falls broadly into two main divisions, namely, the economic value of migration as a long-range policy and the form which migration policy should take over the period of the next few years.11. In Part I of our Report we first consider the economic aspects of migration, including the position of Great Britain in relation to emigration (Section II (a)), and the position of the Dominions in relation to immigration (Section II (b)). Our conclusions under this head are given in Section II (c). In the following section (Section III) we discuss other aspects of Empire migration. Turning to migration as a short-period policy, we outline in Part II of our Report (Section IV) the methods adopted since 1922 by His M&quot;ajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to encourage migration to the Dominions, and in Section V we give some account of the difficulties which have been experienced in this country in carrying out the migration policy hitherto followed and our suggestions for their removal.12. In Part III we deal in Section VI with the question of Irish immigration into the United Kingdom, the repatriation of British immigrants from the Dominions. In the same Section, we discuss the desirability of providing facilities for travel within the Empire. We refer also here to the possibilities for migration offered by the Colonial Empire. In Part IV, our general conclusions on both heads of our inquiry are summarised, with our recommendations, in Section VII, and these, with our recommenda-tions, are summarised in Section VIII.13. In addition to the list of witnesses (Appendix I) we give as Appendix II a series of statistical notes illustrating the arguments embodied in the earlier part of our Report dealing with the trend of population and the population requirements of this country and of the Dominions, together with figures showing the volume of migration in recent years, the cost of assisted migration, &amp;c. In Appendix III we give calculations submitted by the Oversea Settlement Department regarding the economic value of migration, with our observations thereon. Appendix IV gives the text of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922; and Appendix V a list of State-aided Voluntary Migration Societies. In Appendix VI we give particulars of Land Settlement Schemes arranged under the Empire Settlement Act.
PART I.-MIGRATION AS A LONG-RANGE PROBLEM.II.-THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF MIGRATION, (a) Great Britain and Emigration.(i) Trend of Population.14. There is a two-fold assumption underlying the policy of State-aided migration. Firstly, it is assumed that it is to the interest of this country to promote emigration to the Dominions and, secondly, that it is to the interest of the Dominions to increase their population by receiving immigrants from Great Britain. In considering the economic value of migration our first task- is, therefore, to examine the validity of these assumptions. Migration, it should be observed, implies much more than the mere transference of population from one place to another. It is not the distance of the two places from one another, but their separation by a political frontier that is of importance; It is true that the migrant from the United Kingdom to the Dominions does not pass from one sovereignty to another fas he would if he emigrated from this country to the United States of America), but only from one self-governing portion of the Empire to another. The effect, however, is much the same. He passes from one economic unit, faced with its special problems of population and its particular population requirements, to another economic unit where these problems are, or may be, of quite a different and even conflicting nature. It is, therefore, desirable to consider separately the trend of population in this country and in each of the principal Dominions.15. Since 1871, the population of Great Britain has increased from about 26 millions to about 43 millions, but during that period the average annual gain per cent, has declined from 1-39 to 0-40 (Appendix II, Note 1). Of the three factors (annual gain by births, annual loss by deaths and annual net emigration) that determine the net annual gain or loss of population, emigration has been the least important and has fluctuated from decade to decade. The birth-rate has fallen rapidly during recent years, more rapidly than the death-rate, and though the aggregate population has continued to increase up to the present, this increase is dependent on the peculiar age distribution of our present population resulting from the higher birth-rates of previous years. As regards the future, any forecast must depend on what assumptions are made regarding fertility and mortality rates. Such assumptions must necessarily be speculative in character, and great caution is required in drawing conclusions based upon them. As regards mortality rates, efforts will, no doubt, continue to be made by man to reduce the chances of death and these will be reflected in some further improvement in the mortality rates. Over a long period of time, however, the most important factor affecting these rates is the mortality rate of women of child-bearing age (i.e., women of the ages from 15 to 50). That this is unlikely to be materially reduced can be seen from the fact that in England and Wales in the period 1920-22, the average number of years lived during the 35-year period from the age of 15 to that of 50 by each female child born was as high as 28-61. For these reasons, we are led to conclude that no material improvement should be looked for in the present mortality rates of such a nature as will affect the trend of population.16. When we turn to the fertility rate, we are confronted with a much more difficult problem. The fall in the rate is no doubt due in the main to the spread of contraceptive practices. Though there has been some slackening in the fall during the last year or so,
it is likely to continue because it maybe expected that contraception will extend more widely among the wage-earning classes. While it may be said that contraception is practised for economic reasons, it is only true in the sense that the smaller the family the larger is the income available for purposes other than the support of children. It is not resorted to because real income is&quot; declining, nor is it most employed by those whose real income is lowest. It is the mechanism which leads to the modern ideal of the small family. It would, therefore, be unreasonable to assume that in the absence of any new factor the fall in the fertility rate is likely to be arrested for a considerable period to come. The average age of marriage and the marriage rate have both been very steady for a number of years, and may be expected to continue at about the same level as at present.17. We have prepared tables which are given in Appendix II estimating the future course of the population figures on the following alternative assumptions : (a) That both the fertility-rate and the death-rates in thevarious age-groups remain as in 1928-29. (Notes 2 and 8.)(b) That the fertility-rate continues to fall until 1948 at thesame proportionate rate as in recent years, becoming stationary thereafter, while the death-rates in the various age-groups continue throughout to follow their recent trends.   (Notes 4 and 5.)In both cases, we give separate estimates on the assumptions (1) that there is no emigration, and (2) that emigration continues at the rate of 1928-29.18. It will be apparent from what has been said above that the tables prepared on the first set of assumptions, i.e., stationary fertility and mortality rates, are likely to over-estimate the population in future years. For, wdiereas, if contraceptive practices continue to spread, we must expect a further decline in the fertility rate which will exert a cumulative effect on the population figures, these figures can hardly be very powerfully affected by a further-decline in mortality-rates, for which , as has been pointed out, there is in the higher age-groups comparatively little scope. None the less, it is worth observing that even on these assumptions, the population would begin to decline in the quinquennium 1988-48 if emigration were to continue at the rate of 1928-29, and would approach a stationary condition in the quinquennium 1948-53 if emigration were to cease altogether. It is a fact which is not sufficiently appreciated that already \ve have less than a replace-ment birth-rate. If, for example, all the female children born last year were to survive to the age of 30, there would then be less women aged 30 than there are to-day.19. In the second pair of tables (Notes 4 and 5), we assume that the fertility-rate continues to decline until 1943, and that mortality-rates for each age-group continue to move as they have done in recent years. On these assumptions, the population would begin to decline as early as the quinquennium 1938-38, if emigra-tion were to be maintained at the level of 1928-29, and would decline in the quinquennium 1938-48, if emigration were to cease altogether. The population of working-age would not, however, begin to decline (in the absence of emigration) until the quin-quennium 1948-48, and the decline would not become considerable until the following quinquennium.(ii) The Economic Conditions of Emigration.20. The trend of population in Great Britain is highly relevant both to the feasibility and to the desirability of a long-period emigra-tion policy.   In ordinary circumstances a large and continuous flow
of emigrants can be only expected from countries where the birth-rate is high and where the population is tending to increase more rapidly than the absorptive power of the domestic economic system. This general presumption is confirmed by the modern history of emigration. France is the outstanding example of a country from which emigration has been negligible in the past half-century, and this is clearly largely attributable to the fact that France was the first country in which birth restriction made serious headway, and in which the natural increase of the population began to show a decline apart from migration. Great Britain is now beginning to resemble pre-war France in these respects.21. During the xixth century emigrants were mainly drawn either from those rural areas where the growth of numbers was pressing seriously against the means of subsistence, or from urban areas where a relatively low standard of life prevailed. Until 1912 there were no figures making it possible to distinguish between emigration from Ireland and emigration from Great Britain, but there is no doubt that Ireland contributed a very large quota to the total emigration from the United Kingdom. Moreover, of the emigrants from Great Britain, large numbers were drawn from rural districts, notably, the Highlands of Scotland, where the economic conditions were similar in character to those of Ireland. The great majority of those who left the shores of Great Britain in the last century were leaving conditions such as made the prospect of a hard and limited pioneer life in the New World an attraction rather than a deterrent.22. These conditions on which the supply of emigrants pre-viously depended have undergone a radical change within the last generation. The population of the Scottish Highlands has now been reduced to sparse dimensions. The agricultural population of Great Britain generally has dwindled, and its standard of living has been raised, so that there are no longer large numbers of English people accustomed to rural life who are anxious to find new openings over-seas. The conditions of life in large towns have been greatly, improved, and the position of the worker has been made more secure by the comprehensive system of social services which has been developed during the present century. Great strides, in short, have been made in eliminating the evils of extreme poverty and destitution from the social life of the United Kingdom,- and the general standard of living is considerably higher than it was. These changes necessarily affect, the readiness to emigrate. To many potential emigrants to-day, the Dominions appear to offer as an immediate prospect a life more precarious and with fewer amenities than that which they must leave behind. The higher the standard of life at home and the more extensive the system of social provision, the more difficult and expensive must it be to maintain a substantial flow of emigration.(iii) The Standpoint of the State.28. When we consider the balance of economic advantage to the country from which emigration takes place, similar considera-tions arise. In a country where the birth-rate is high and the population is tending to increase rapidly, emigration may be of immense advantage not only to the emigrants themselves, but to those who remain behind. Indeed, under such conditions, emigration may be an indispensable means of raising or maintaining the standard of life against the pressure of numbers. A country whose birth-rate has fallen below a replacement level is in a very different position. We reserve till later -(paragraphs 28-88) the question of how far emigration, at the present juncture, might be of economic advantage to Great Britain in view of the special circumstances of her post-war unemployment as well as all considerations of a non-economic character (paragraphs 59-82). In general, however, it is clear that the historic function of emigration of protecting the standard of living from the pressure of numbers is being increasingly discharged in Great Britain by the declining tendency of the birth-rate. From the purely economic standpoint, moreover, there is no reason to regret this change.    A country
from which emigration takes place bears the cost of maintaining the emigrants during the unproductive period of their lives, while it is the country to which they migrate which derives the direct benefit of their productive energies. It is thus a costly business for a country to bring up children who later migrate abroad, and under modern conditions this cost is tending to increase. The upbringing of children now entails a considerable charge not only upon the resources of their parents, but, as the result of the development of public education, maternity, and child welfare services, &amp;c, during the last two generations, upon the public funds as well. It may be computed roughly that for every child who attains school-leaving age there has been spent  100 from public funds on education alone, while the total cost of upbringing to the State and to the parents may be put at upwards of  300. If the individual upon whom this expenditure has been incurred migrates at an early age to another country, it is obvious that the community secures little or no direct economic return. From the economic standpoint, therefore, even if a smaller population is desirable, emigration is a wasteful means of securing it.24. Emigration, moreover, is a highly selective process. The population from which the emigrants are drawn is far from being homogeneous. It is differentiated by sex, by age and by inborn and acquired capacity. From the point of view of emigra-tion. these differences may be of relatively little moment for a country with a growing or surplus population, but in countries situated as is Great Britain to-day, they assume a special importance. It is, no doubt, true, whatever the conditions may be as to over- or under-population, that there are at all times persons, the mentally defective, for instance, whose departure would benefit the country by the annual cost of their maintenance multiplied by as many years as they will live. Again, there are persons whose departure would, in any circumstances, be a loss to the country from which they emigrated. The bulk of the population is, however, neither mentally defective nor gifted with genius, but is nevertheless so differentiated by inborn capacity that an assumption of equality is misleading. As regards age and sex, it appears (Appendix II, Notes- 6 and 7) that in 1926 the percentage of males among emigrants from the United Kingdom was 53-7, whereas among the population as a whole it was 47-8. Of the males who emigrated in 1928, about 80 per cent, were boys under 18, and 55 per cent, were between 18 and 30, leaving only about 15 per cent, over 30 years. In the population as a whole, the corresponding percentages for males are S3 per cent, under 18, 21 per cent, between 18 and 30, and 46 per cent., over 30. So far as these figures go, and they are confirmed by all other figures, emigration accentuates the already existing large excess of females in this country, and draws disproportionately upon persons in the prime of life. There are no available figures to show whether the occupational distribution of emigrants differs from that of the total population, but that this is so is highly probable in view of the tendency of the Dominions to restrict facilities for the immigration of males as far as possible to persons willing to take up agricultural employment.25. There remain those differentiating characteristics which are not measurable health, intelligence, enterprise, and so on. We know that the population is highly differentiated in respect of these characteristics. We also know that persons of subnormal health and intelligence are refused admittance by every country. We know, further, that the standards imposed by the Dominions require a physical and intellectual capacity that is probably above the average. Further, and probably far more important, there is the self-selecting aspect of emigration. Whether assisted or unassisted, the emigrant tends in each category of the population to be the least obviously surplus. Thus, emigration takes the men rather than the women, the young rather than the old, the bright and ambitious rather than the. dull and lethargic.26. Emigrants are, therefore, not a random sample of the population. There are more males than females; there is already in this country a large excess of females.   They are largely drawn[5387] o
from persons in the prime of life. They are above the average in physique and health, and more than all they may certainly be assumed to be above the average in just those qualities of enter-prise, leadership and resilience which are needed at home. Thus emigration draws unduly upon those elements in the population of which this country has most need.27. The practical importance of the foregoing considerations must not, of course, be exaggerated. Emigration has never in recent years risen as high as 1 per cent, of the population of working age; and,1 so long as it is limited to these dimensions, the injury done by its selective tendencies to the average quality of the population is not likely to be serious.(iv) Great Britain&apos;s Post-War Economic Difficulties.28. We turn to consider how far these general considerations are overborne by the special circumstances arising from the economic difficulties which Great Britain has experienced since the war. Unemployment has ruled at a high level for a decade, and there attaches to some important and highly localised industries a substantial surplus of labour which those industries are unlikely to reabsorb, and a transference of which to other occupations and other districts is a matter of great difficulty. In these circum-stances it can be argued that despite the rapid fall in the birthrate and the near approach of a stationary population, we have none the less, for the time being at all events, a surplus of population relatively to the absorptive powers of our industrial life. For so long, accordingly, as our abnormal post-war unemployment persists, the claim can he made that emigration is capable of giving the same sort of relief that it gave to Scotland and the Scottish High-lands during the last century, and that this relief will involve incidentally, through a reduction of the sum expended on unemployment pay, a considerable saving to public funds.29. In considering the validity of these arguments, it is necessary to bear in mind some of the considerations which were outlined in the preceding section. Emigration, as has been pointed out, is a highly selective process, and it by no means follows that because there are large numbers of unemployed in Great Britain, the emigration of anyone from Great Britain will serve to diminish the numbers of the unemployed. The industrial system is not so elastic that we can safely assume that the departure of any individual from the position which he holds will necessarily mean that some other individual at present out of work will thereby be enabled to find a job. If emigrants to the Dominions are drawn from occupations where no special surplus of labour exists, but where perhaps, periods of bad trade apart, a tendency to a shortage of labour may prevail, the result may be to aggravate rather than to relieve the unemployment problem.30. The assistance, therefore, that emigration would give to our emergency unemployment problem, turns largely upon the character of the emigration itself, and though calculations have been put before us (which we discuss in Appendix III) estimating the saving to public funds in respect of unemployment pay, &amp;c, which may be set to the credit of emigration, we feel unable to endorse them as generally valid. In this connexion, moreover, it is necessary to remember that the effect of emigration in reducing unemployment may be partly counteracted by increased inimigra-tion, especially from the Irish Free State. We discuss this question later (paragraph 178). On balance, however, we are satisfied that, under such conditions of unemployment as prevail to-day in Great Britain, emigration, regarded as a whole, is of definite economic advantage to the State.31.   The period of time over which the existence of unemploy-ment makes emigration economically advantageous, despite the falling birthrate, is, we may hope, a limited one. The unemployment which is relevant to the problem of emigration accounts statistically for only a small proportion of our total unemployment figures.    The aggregate Live register figure of
unemployment may be divided for the purposes of our argument under three broad heads : (i) Normal unemployment such as must be expected to existunder good trade conditions;(ii) The   unemployment  attributable   to  the   present  worlddepression of trade; and(iii) The unemployment attributable to the continuing post-war difficulties of British industry.Unemployment under the first and second of the above heads cannot be dealt with by means of emigration, and these two categories account between them for by far the greater part of the numbers who are registered to-day as unemployed. The uuem-ployment for which emigration might provide a remedy is that under the third head, which is to be reckoned by hundreds of thousands rather than millions and consists for the most part of a surplus of labour attaching to certain old-established industries, some of them highly-localized, like coal and cotton.32.   This unemployment is mainly attributable to the loss by Great Britain of her former j)redominant position in the world&apos;s markets.    We  cannot  take  an  optimistic view of  the future prospects of our export trade.   On the contrary, there are, in our judgment, serious grounds for fearing that our exporting industries may find it increasingly difficult to maintain even their present position.    The vast  scale  of the  British  export trade in  the nineteenth century was largely attributable to the momentum which Great Britain derived from being first in the field as an industrial country.   For many years we had a virtual monopoly of the business of exchanging manufactured goods for the food-stuffs and raw materials of other lands: the competition of rival manufacturing countries grew up only gradually; and, even after it began to assume formidable dimensions, it was naturally a long time before it did more, in view of the rapidly growing volume of the world&apos;s commerce, than reduce the rate at which our trade increased.. To-day, however, the process of industrialization has spread all over the world; the advantage which we derived from our first start as an industrial country has, in a large measure, worn itself outr in almost every branch of international commerce our industries are exposed to a growing competition, coming sometimes from countries which are richer than ourselves in natural resources and at least as strong in point of technical efficiency,  sometimes from countries which have the competitive advantage of lower labour costs.   Meanwhile, the growth of international commerce is impeded by- an increasingly widespread determination to establish local industries and to sustain them by protective tariffs.   In these circumstances, we  are unable to regard the difficulties of our exporting industries as a merely transient phenomenon.   Though it is only since the war that they have come to a head, they represent the cumulative effect of tendencies which were at work for a long period before and which are likely, we fear, to prove enduring.   For the purposes of this Beport, at all events, we think it wise to proceed on the assumption that, rips and downs of trade apart, our exporting industries may never succeed in recovering-the ground which they have lost.83. But even though it should prove that our export trade, so far from recovering, continues to decline further, it by no means follows that the unemployment which is to-day attributable to our loss of exports will prove equally persistent. The absorption in other occupations of the surplus of labour-attaching to highly localized industries like coal and cotton is peculiarly difficult, but it seems probable that the problem is by no means so intractable as is commonly assumed. Although the aggregate unemployment figures in the years preceding the slump appeared to range only within comparatively narrow limits, radical changes were taking place in the experience-of particular industries. The number of coal-miners unemployed increased from 30,000 in the spring of 1924 to 315,000 in June 1925, and stood at the even higher figure of 325,000 in July 1928,[5387] o 2
but then fell to 138,000 in January 1980. It is to be noted, moreover, that although these variations were largely attributable to fluctuations in the activity of coal-mining, there was a steady reduction throughout the period in the number of persons attached to the industry. The total number of persons between the ages of 16 and 65 attached to coal-mining (i.e., both employed and unemployed) was about 1,225,000 in the summer of 1924. By the summer of 1929 the number had fallen to about 1,075,000, a reduction of 150,000 in five years. Thus we may say that it was not until 1924 that the phenomenon of a large-scale surplus of miners began to emerge. It then represented for a few years the major part of the &quot;hard core&quot; of unemployment. But largely as the result of the absorption of unemployed miners in other occupations, its dimensions were being rapidly reduced up to the outbreak of the world depression. Unfortunately the progress which was made in reducing the number of surplus miners was counterbalanced by an aggravation of the difficulties of other industries, such as cotton. None the less, the substantial diminution which was effected in the number of work-people attached to the coal-mining industry suggests that we should not under-estimate the power of the ordinary forces of economic expansion to absorb surplus labour attaching to particular industries, provided no new depressing factor makes its appearance.34. During the post-war decade the difficulties of industries like coal, iron and steel, shipping, shipbuilding, engineering, cotton and other textiles, have subjected the economic life of Great Britain to a quite abnormal strain, and the part which these industries play in our national economic life is so large that we could hardly have hoped to adapt ourselves quickly and easily to a new industrial equilibrium. None the less, new industries and occupations have developed on an important and steadily-growing scale, and it does not seem unreasonable to hope that when world trade improves Great Britain will gradually succeed in establishing a new industrial equipoise, adjusted to the altered economic circumstances of the post-war age. It is to be hoped, in other words, that unemployment will in due course resume the general character which it had before the war, i.e., that of a phenomenon of fluctuations of business activity rather than of a quasi-permanent surplus of labour. The tendency for the population to approach a stationary level suggests that this should be no extravagant hope.35. Even if, however, we were to reject this view and to assume that Great Britain has entered on a phase of steady economic decline, emigration would provide no satisfactory remedy for such a state of affairs, for under conditions of a stationary or declining population large-scale emigration, drawing as it must tend to do primarily on the young and the adventurous, would exert an effect on the average quality of those left behind which could only be viewed with the most serious misgivings.36. In a later paragraph (paragraph 53) (Section II (b)) we call attention to the economic circumstances which make it likely that Dominion agriculture will move away from the extensive system of farming characteristic of the development of prairie provinces towards more intensive methods of mixed farming, and we point out that there is no very strong presumption that the Dominions have any natural advantage as compared with Great Britain for the development of agriculture of this type. Since we import large quantities of foodstuffs from abroad, including such things as dairy produce, eggs, bacon, &amp;c, which Great Britain is technically and climatically vvell-adapted to produce, it would clearly be possible for us to employ substantial numbers of additional people on the land in Britain, if we are prepared to pay a sufficient price. It would be better, we think, regarded purely as an economic and social proposition, to incur public expenditure for this purpose than for *hat of stimulating a process which must tend to impair the quality
ISof the population which remains at home. In this connection we would like to state our view of the great importance of promoting land settlement at home, if some of the obstacles to emigration set out above are to be overcome. If the Dominions retain their preference for agricultural immigrants, the maintenance of migration on a large scale from Great Britain will only be possible if the steady decline in the rural population at home is arrested and reversed. Land settlement in Great Britain is in the long run an essential condition of extensive migration for land settlement in the Dominions.87. The growing unfamiliarity of the people of Great Britain with rural pursuits and rural life has been in recent years one of the primary obstacles to Empire migration, and there is no other way in which this obstacle can be overcome than by developing our own agriculture and associating increasing numbers of persons with the habits and aptitudes of rural life. It appears to us therefore that the development of small holdings in Great Britain is a necessary corollary to land settlement overseas; not only because smallholders&apos; children would provide the best type for settlement on the land overseas, but also because an active small-holding policy at home would remove the reproach that the Governments efforts were confined to settling men on the land overseas, while nothing was being done to enable them to settle on the land at home. We believe that the psychological effect upon the whole section of the community from which migrants are mainly drawn would be considerable. There can be no doubt that there is still a large unsatisfied demand for land, and it is worthy of note that, during the last, decade and owing to the agricultural depression, some 150,000 agricultural workers have left the land. Many of these would make excellent smallholders, and since a considerable proportion are probably unemployed they would welcome the opportunity of returning to a career on the land. No other country has so small a proportion of its population living on the land, and any well-considered measure that would bring back cultivators to the soil would be to the national advantage. We have indicated in other parts of this Beport that the Dominions are suffering from an acute agricultural depression due in part to over-production, and that, therefore, for several years to come there is little hope of placing men upon the land overseas in any large numbers. But placing men upon small holdings at home is a very different matter; they are at the door of one of the best markets in the world; they will be in a climate and on land admirably suited for intensive mixed production. Properly7 situated and run small holdings have been proved to resist the present agricultural depression far better than larger units on which it is necessary to employ hired labour; but we feel it incumbent to point, out that the success and development of a small holdings movement depends largely upon proper organisation and control in the marketing and handling of all agricultural produce.(v) The Prospects for Emigration.88. The position, therefore, as regards the economic value of emigration to Great Britain, would appear to be as follows : (a) That in view of the progressive decline in our birth-rate, andthe likelihood of a gradual readjustment of our industrial life to post-war conditions, it is hardly likely that large-scale emigration would be economically advantageous to us as a long-period policy.(b) That   in   view   of   our   post-war   economic   difficultiesemigration would be economically advantageous for us as an emergency policy for the next few years, though carrying certain disadvantages as a result of its selective tendencies.
(b) The Dominions and Immigration.(i) Trend of Population.(a) Australia and New Zealand.39. The trend of population in Australia and New Zealand from 1871 to 1928 is in many respects similar to that in Great Britain (Appendix II, Notes 8 and 9). The birth-rates and death-rates havr, both declined and for the same reasons as in this country. In both countries, however, the problem is one of immigration instead of emigration and is of much greater relative importance. As regards the birth-rate, though the decline is no doubt largely attributable to the use of contraceptive methods, the effect has not been so great as in Great Britain, since both Australia and New Zealand still have more than a replacement birth-rate. Upon the basis of the present fertility and mortality rates there is, however, a diminishing rate of natural increase as a result of changes in the age distribution, and increased immigration is required if the jtresent rate of net increase is to be maintained.40. A number of studies have been made on the population capacity of Australia. In Appendix II we give a table (Note 10) showing what the population of Australia would be if the various areas were populated at the same density as areas in the western parts of the United States of America possessing the same rainfall. Calculations of this kind must necessarily be highly speculative, at; rainfall is not the only climatic factor affecting population capacity. For what they are worth, these calculations place the potential population of Australia at approximately 30,000,000 as compared with the present population of about 6,500,000. Similar calcula-tions based upon the whole of the United States would raise the figure to approximately 46,000,000. The same method could, no doubt, be applied to New Zealand, although owing to the greater diversity of climate and topography the results would probably be of little value.41. In the period from 1860 to 1924, the average rate of the growth of the population of Australia amounted to 2J per cent, per annum. The annual rates have varied very strikingly during different periods mainly owing to fluctuations in the number of immigrants: in the period 1901-1905 the departures actually exceeding arrivals by 16,793, and in 1930 by 11,408. In order to maintain an annual rate of increase of, say, 2 per cent, per annum, the natural increase of the population would require to be supplemented by 52,000 immigrants per annum. The corresponding number of immigrants required by New Zealand would on the same basis amount to 13,000. The two Dominions together would there-fore require. 65,000 immigrants annually. In the period 1923 to 1928 approximately three-quarters of the net immigration into both Dominions was from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while a considerable proportion of the remaining quarter came from Southern Ireland. If the proportion from Great Britain and Northern Ireland is maintained, Australia and New Zealand may be expected to absorb annually 40,000 and 10,000 immigrants from Great Britain respectively, and these numbers would gradually increase as the population rose and the rate of natural increase diminished.42. Past history shows how unpredictable is the absorptive capacity of the Dominions from year to year, and the circumstances of the present world depression, with which we deal in paragraphs 47-53 below, render still more speculative any forecasts that may be made. At the moment immigration is practically at a standstill both to,Australia and to New Zealand, and everything points to the pro-bability that the absorptive capacity of these Dominions in the present decade will be substantially lower than the figures indicated above.
(b) Canada.43. There are no reliable vital statistics for Canada prior to 1901, but in respect of the period since that date (Appendix IT, Note 11) the statistics disclose a different situation to that obtaining hi the other Dominions. The birth-rate for Canada as a whole is higher than in this country or in the other Dominions. This figure is, however, misleading, as in the French Province of Quebec the rate is much higher than in the rest of Canada and shows little sign of dropping. This is no doubt due to an unrestricted birth-rate. As regards the remaining provinces in Canada, the trend of the birth-rate is similar to that in Australia and New Zealand. Taken as a whole, however, Canada has far more than a replacement birth-rate.44. It is far more difficult to judge the population requirements of Canada than&apos;those of other Dominions as, owing to the complica-tions introduced by continental migration movements, between 3871 and 1901 the total increment of the population was less than the total natural increase. This means that not only was the whole of the net overseas immigration lost to Canada by continental emigration from Canada into the United States but also part of the natural increase. Since the war, the position has reverted to that obtaining before 1900, the total increment each year having been less than the natural increase.45. The average annual rate of increase for Canada approached 3-5 per cent, for the decade 1901-1911, was 24 per cent for the decade 1911-1921, and since that date has not exceeded 2 per cent. It will be seen, therefore, that the rate of increase in Canada in the last decade has been slightly lower than that of Australia and New Zealand (paragraph 38). The average annual net immigration for the last three decades is not available, but Canada takes a much larger proportion of non-British immigrants than do the other Dominions. As regards immigration from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the.net average annual figure for the decade 1921-30 was approximately 41,000.4fi. Assuming that the Dominions were, to continue to develop over a period of years at the same average rate in the future as in the past, and that immigration from the United Kingdom were to continue to form the same percentage of all immigration, the Dominions might be expected, on the average, to absorb a net immigration from the United Kingdom of 90,000 persons annually Canada and Australia 40,000 each and New Zealand 10,000. This figure would tend to rise as the population of the Dominions grew, and as the natural increase of the Dominions declined. It would also rise if immigrants from the United Kingdom came to form a larger proportion of all immigrants. Non-British immigration into Canada has been so extensive that there is much scope for raising the figure by an increase in the proportion of immigrants from the United Kingdom in the case of this Dominion.(ii) The Agricultural Depression.47. We turn now to consider the effect which the present depression is likely to exert on the capacity of the Dominions to absorb immigrants. At present most forms of economic activity are seriously curtailed throughout the world by an abnormal trade depression. This depression has fallen upon the Dominions with particular severity, and so long as it lasts it is clear that they will afford very little scope for immigrants. This general depression of trade, however, though it may prove exceptionally prolonged by the standard of past depressions, may be expected to lift at the worst within, say, a few years. The crucial question is whether agriculture in the Dominions is likely to spring forward again buoyantly as soon as the general trade conditions improve. When the economic tendencies which are at work to-day are closely studied, it becomes difficult to return an affirmative answer to this question. The central feature of the present world depression is the extreme severity of the slump in prices of staple
agricultural products. In no previous depression has there been so marked a disparity as that which obtains to-day between the prices of primary products on the one hand and of finished goods and services on the other. No communities are as seriously hit to-day as those which depend on selling agricultural produce in world markets. In the ease of wheat, which, as the dominating produce of Canada and an important product of Australia, is particularly relevant to our problem, the fall in price has reached catastrophic proportions. The slump in wheat has given rise to a condition of extreme distress among farmers in the prairie provinces of Canada, and coupled with the low price of wool on the top of an unsound financial situation, has helped to derange even more seriously the economic life of Australia.48. The point which we are concerned to emphasise is that staple agricultural prices have been leaders in the downward move-ment of commodity prices to a degree which is unusual in trade depressions. It is only to be expected that agriculturalists should suffer when trade is general!)&apos; depressed, but on the present occasion the indications are, so far as the commodity side of the depression is concerned, that the slackening of trade and industry has resulted from the agricultural slump and the consequent impoverishment of agricultural communities rather than the other way about. This view is borne out by the fact that the stability of the markets for primary products had been palpably precarious for some time before the actual slump. Indeed, one of the outstanding features of the years preceding the slump was the growth of organisations throughout the world, such as Canadian Wheat Pools, Coffee Valorisation Schemes, and Eubber restriction Schemes, having, amid much diversitjs the common aim of main-taining market prices for primary products against the threat arising from a growing tendency for supply to exceed demand. In the light of subsequent events, it seems not unreasonable to conclude that the agricultural slump was really overdue and was merely delayed by the various artificial measures taken in the hope of averting it.49. The reasonableness of this view, so far as wheat is concerned, is strengthened when we consider the rapid rate at which wheat-growing expanded during the past decade. The following table shows the increase in the area under wheat and the production of wheat for Canada, Australia and the world as a whole :  Wheat Acreage and Production.Year.	Canada.		Australia.		World (including Russia).		Area.	Pro-due tion.	Area.	Pro-duction.	Area.	Pro-duction.1909-13 ... 1925 1020 1927 1928	Millions of Acres. 9-9 20-8 22-9 22&apos;4 24-1	Millions of Quarters. 24-2 48 -4 49-9 58-7 65-4	Millions of Acres. 7-6 10 2 11-7 12 3 14-2	Millions of Quarters. 11-1 140 19-7 14-5 19-5	Millions of Acres. 270 6 280 &quot;4 299 2 309 0 306-5	Millions of Quarters. 463 500 520 527 564Thus the area under wheat in Canada in 1928 was not far short of 2j times what it was from 1909 to 1913, while the production of wheat had risen in an even larger proportion. The rate of increase, moreover, was being steadily maintained up to the occurrence of the world slump. Indeed, the exports of wheat from Canada rose between 1925 - and 1928 by over 50 per cent. In Australia the rate of increase was less rapid, though none the less remarkable. Moreover, in order that the full significance of these figures may be appreciated two other facts must be borne in mind. In the first place, wheat is a commodity for which the demand tends normally to increase at a comparatively slow rate;
for, since bread is the cheapest foodstuff for Western peoples, there is a tendency for people to consume less bread rather than more as their standard of living improves. Secondly, there has been a tendency during the past decade, which is now being sharply accentuated, for European countries to restrict the importation of wheat from overseas in the interests of their own agricultural populations. Thus, the rapid growth in the wheat production of the New World has been accompanied by a restriction of the markets open to it.50. In the light of these facts we regard it as unlikely that the staple forms of agriculture, and wheat-growing in particular, will recover the expansiveness which they displayed in the last decade when the general trade depression passes away. It seems to us more likely that, though there may well be before long a partial recovery from the extremely7 low prices now prevailing, the production of wheat and other staple agricultural products for world markets will remain in a condition of comparative depression for several years to come. This unfavourable hypothesis may of course be upset by7 unforeseeable developments; the substitution, for example, of bread for rice in the dietary of Eastern peoples might entirely transform the whole corn-growing outlook. There is, however, no likelihood that any such development is likely7 to occur in the. near future on a considerable scale. On the other hand, such other complicating factors as it is possible to discern are of a kind unfavourable to corn-growing, e.g., the return of Russia to world markets as a supplier of wheat on an important scale.51. Thus the requirements of the economic situation, so far as it is possible to foresee them, appear to point not to an expansion but to a contraction of wheat growing, a contraction which is likely7 to be accomplished only very slowly and painfully7. Indeed, we doubt if it would be going beyond the mark to suggest that some forms of agriculture, and in particular the supply of wheat for world markets, are likely in the next decade to cut much the same figure of relative distress in the world&apos;s economy7 that has been cut in the past decade by the depressed exporting industries of Great Britain. There seems therefore to be a profound incongruity in regarding the former as a. large potential opening for the surplus labour of&apos;the latter.52. The above considerations have an important bearing on the capacity of the Dominions to absorb immigrants in the near future, for agriculture plays a very large part in the economic life of the Dominions, and their agriculture is in a very large degree concerned with the production of the commodities, notably wheat, which are most severely depressed. Immigration into Canada during the past half-century has been largely associated with the development of new w7heat-growing areas, and both Canada and Australia have in recent yrears shown a preference for workers for agriculture.53. In view of the severe depression of w7heat-growing, it is to-be expected that the Dominions, and Canada in particular, wiil gradually effect a change in the character of their agriculture. Those forms of agriculture which are concerned with dairy produce and animal products generally are not, speaking broadly, especially depressed at the present time, and when general trade conditions improve, there are likely to be opportunities for the development of such forms of agriculture of which Canada and the other Dominions will doubtless take advantage. We may7 thus expect to see a change-over from the extensive wheat-farming which has been characteristic of the development of the prairie provinces to mixed farming of a more intensive type. Along such lines Dominion agriculture will doubtless derive partial compensation for the depression of cereal production which is to be expected.(iii) The Prospects for Immigration.54. From the standpoint of migration, however&apos;, something of a paradox would be involved in basing large expectations on the evolution of Dominion agriculture in the direction of mixed farming.[5387] n
(c) The Economic Disharmony.50. It will be clear from the preceding analysis that we are now confronted with a profound disharmony between the economic needs of Great Britain on the one hand, and the Dominions on the other, in regard to migration. During the next few years, emigration might be of substantial benefit to Great Britain; but over a longer period it may not represent a desirable economic policy for a country which is moving towards a stationary7 population. The Dominions, on the other hand, are unlikely for some years to be in a position to absorb immigrants on a considerable scale, though their capacity to do so w7ill certainly revive later on. Now that it might suit us to send large numbers of our people to the Dominions, it does not suit the Dominions to receive them. When the time comes when the Dominions will again welcome immigrants, it may not be to our economic interest to supply7 the need.57. When to these broad considerations we add the difficulties arising from the growing urbanisation of British life, and the higher standards of living, amenity and security which now prevail, we the common assumption that emigration from Great Britain to, say, Canada, is a desirable economic process, rests on the facts that Great Britain is a small, densely-populated island, and Canada a land of vast empty spaces. But this contrast only affords economic justifica-tion for emigration in so far as the vast empty spaces of Canada are an advantage for production. Now for the production of wheat by the extensive methods traditional in the prairie provinces, the abundance of land in Canada and its virgin character are very real advantages. In most parts of Great Britain the cost of land would be a very formidable obstacle to any attempt to produce wheat here on a similar system. In general for any form of agriculture which uses a large quantity of land to produce a given output the undeveloped countries of the New World have a great advantage over Europe, but for mixed farming on comparatively small acreage this relative advantage is much less. Thus the conversion of Dominion agriculture to mixed farming, though it doubtless repre-eents a desirable line of evolution in the circumstances that have arisen, involves in an important degree the abandonment of the great advantage on which the general presumption of superior opportunities in the New World is based. In respect of other natural conditions, such as water supply7 and temperate climate, which are important for mixed farming, Great Britain has the advantage over the Dominions.55. It is far from clear, therefore, that for some considerable time to come the opportunities for the development of mixed farming in Canada will be superior to those which exist in Great Britain. In the course of years, no doubt, mixed farming may be expected to grow largely in those parts of Canada where the climate and water supply permit, as the result of the development which may be expected in Canada&apos;s general industrial and com-mercial life. For Canada is well equipped with natural resources and technique for industrial production, and when trade conditions improve, her manufacturing activity may be expected to go steadily ahead. But when due account is taken of this factor, it still seems to us unlikely that Canada and the other Dominions will for many years offer opportunities for immigration comparable with those which they offered in the past decade. During the &quot;twenties,&quot; as we have pointed out above, there w7as an abnormally rapid expansion of the characteristic types of Dominion agriculture. During the present decade the process of contraction is likely7 to be substituted for the previous expansion. This change Will necessarily7 tend to retard the growth of the general economic life of the Dominions affected, and it seems to us unlikely therefore that the Dominions will for many years to come be as ready to welcome new immigrants as they were in the post-war decade, unless there is an unexpectedly7 rapid development of mineral resources.
think it unlikely that Empire migration will regain very substantial dimensions during any period for which it is profitable to look ahead. It must be recognised that the conditions of the last decade were in some ways peculiarly favourable to Empire migration. For in this period the severe depression of the exporting industries of Great Britain coincided with a rapid development of the economic life of the Dominions, a conjuncture of circumstances which is not very likely to recur. None the less, despite the favouring conditions, and despite the substantial financial assistance afforded-by the British and Dominion Governments, the figures of migration from Great Britain to the Dominions appear io have remained throughout well below their pre-war level. Any exact comparison is rendered impossible by the fact that the, figures of emigration available until 1923 relate to the United Kingdom and thus include what is now the Irish Free State. The facts, however, that the highest figure of emigration from Great-Britain to Canada in any year since 1.923 was 65,000 in 1929, as against a total figure for the United Kingdom of 190,000 in 1913: that to Australia the corresponding figure, after reaching 44,000 in 1926. fell to 29,000 in 1928 and to 18,000 in 1929, as compared with 57,000 from the United Kingdom in 1913, and that the figures relating to other parts of the Empire show broadly similar results, leave no room for doubt that the volume of Empire migration during the past decade was on a definitely smaller scale than it used to be before the war. The fact that this decline has taken place, notwith-standing the encouragement afforded byT Governmental assistance and the conjuncture of the depression of British industry and the expansion of Dominion agriculture, is a testimony to the superior power exercised by the other influences to which we have called attention.58. Now, accordingly, that depression has, for the time being, overtaken the economic life of the Dominions, and that the fall in the British birth-rate is rapidly7 decreasing the numbers of those who attain working age, the influence of economic forces is likely to be adverse to the development of Empire migration.Ill__OTHER ASPECTS OF MIGRATION.59. So far we have dealt with the subject of Empire migra-tion purely from the economic aspect. We realise, how7ever, that there are other considerations to be taken into account. Migration within the British Commonwealth of Nations must be distinguished from emigration to a foreign country. The latter might be regarded as a purely7 economic question; but migration within the Empire raises considerations of a different character which may have an important bearing on migration policy.60. The sense of unity which animates, and is the main connecting link between, the self-governing parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations is largely dependent on the prepon-derance of British stock in the population of the Dominions, and it is of the utmost importance, if the sentiment is to be maintained and the political character of the British Empire is to remain what it has been, that the fresh accessions to the population of the Dominions which take place in future years should contain a large proportion of persons of British origin.61. The large part which Empire trade takes in the total trade of the United Kingdom is also related to the fact that the population of the Dominions have a natural inclination to purchase British goods and the maintenance and growth of this trade is directly related to the size and character of the populations of the Dominions. We proceed therefore to examine these and other non-economic aspects which must affect the question of migration within the Empire.[5387]
(a) Relative Density of the White Population of the United Kingdom and the Dominions.62. Migration is often advocated as a means of providing for the redistribution of the white population of the Empire. The figures given below show extraordinary differences in the density of population in the different Dominions. In considering this question it is important to bear in mind that for climatic and other reasons a large part of the territories convprised in the Dominions will never be able to support a population of any considerable magnitude. The inclusion of such areas in calculating the relative density of their populations would be highly misleading. In our calculations we have, therefore, made deductions on account of areas unfit for white settlement on any considerable scale.63. The average density of the population of England, Wales and Scotland in 1929 was 410 persons to the square mile, of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 483 to the square mile, and of England and Wales alone, 678 to the square mile.64. The total land area of the Dominion of Canada is approximately 3,504,688 square miles. From this area we have deducted the area of the Yukon and the North-West Territories (1,463,563 square miles), the total population of which in 1929 was only 12,400. Moreover, the climate of considerable areas in the Northern parts of the Prairie Provinces and of Quebec and of Ontario renders those areas unsuitable for permanent white settle-ment. After making these allowances, the total area in Canada available, and suitable, for white settlement may be estimated at 1,354,000 square miles. The estimated population of Canada as at the 1st June, 1929, was 9,796,800, and the average density of population was therefore 7-25 to the square mile.65. The total area of Australia is-2,970,000 square miles. Over two-fifths of the entire Continent is desert or semi-desert country, and although, except in bad droughts, about half of this area is fair pastoral country, its value from the point of view of human settlement is negligible. Of the remainder, 100,000 square miles are suitable for tropical agriculture, 1,009,000 square miles are good pastoral country, and only 616,000 square miles can be regarded as suitable for close white settlement. The total white population of Australia is about 6,500,000. If, therefore, three-fifths of the whole of the area of the Commonwealth (viz. 1,725,000 square miles) is assumed to be habitable, the average density of population of the. Commonwealth is 3-75 persons to the square mile.66. The total area of New Zealand (omitting certain small islands) is approximately 104,015 square miles, but after making deductions on account of mountain ranges and inland waters the area that may be considered habitable or usable is 84,500 square miles. This. area carries a population (excluding Maoris) of 16-8 persons to the square mile.67. The total white population of the Union of South Africa is estimated at 1,767,719 in 1929 and the non-European population at 6,126,848. The area of the Union is 471,917 square miles. The existence of a native population outnumbering the European population by more than three to one renders it impossible to make any calculations of value regarding density of population.68. The average density of population of the United Kingdom and of what may be regarded as the habitable areas in the several Dominions may therefore be summarised as follows i Population per square mile.England and Wales    ......... 678Great Britain and Northern Ireland 483England, Wales and Scotland       V.. 410Canada ............        7-25Australia ...      ...      ...      ...        3-75New Zealand   ...      ...      ...      ...      16-8
(b) Desirability of Redistributing the White Population within theEmpire.69. The great differences in the density of the white popula-tion of the Empire as between this country-and the self-governing Dominions are strikingly shown by the figures given in the preceding paragraphs. At present of the 66,000,000 white popula-tion of the British Commonwealth some 48,000,000 are to be found in the British Isles. In this country there is a strong case for the view that on the grounds of mental and physical development and balance our population is too dense. On the other hand, the small populations in the Dominions are inadequate not only for the purpose of the efficient development of the vast territories and resources under their control, but also as a basis for the political, social and industrial superstructure which has been erected. Small populations cannot produce the diversified types which are requisite for the efficient organisation of modern civilised communities. When it is considered, for example, that Australia has seven Parliaments, each (except in Queensland) of two Houses, and each with its separate executive machine, it is clear that it must be difficult for its small population of 6  million to produce the necessary legislators and civil servants with a high average ability, in addition to performing the task of developing a Continent.(c) Facts and Tendencies of the Racial Composition of the Dominions.(i) Canada.70. The latest information regarding the racial composition of the population of Canada relates to the Census of 1921. In that year 55 per cent, of the population was of British stock and nearly 28 per cent. French. The other European stocks constituted 14-16 per cent, of the population. North-Western Europeans (other than British and French) outnumbered other Europeans by nearly 20 per cent., but the proportion of the latter had been growing rapidly and has probably continued to grow since 1921. Since the beginning of the century the British and French stocks have been forming a progressively smaller portion of the population. Between 1901 and 1911 other European stocks increased relatively four times as rapidly as did the British and constituted in 1921 almost- twice as large a proportion of the population as they did in 1901. There is every possibility that as the result of this year&apos;s Canadian census it will be found that the population of British origin in Canada is now in a minority. Effective arrangements to direct population from this country to the Dominion might well determine the composition of Canada&apos;s future population.71. A further feature of the Canadian situation is the peaceful penetration by the United States which has been in progress since the War. In 1913 United States capital investments in Canada were approximately 650 million dollars, in 1931 they approach 3.V thousand million dollars. British investments in Canada have in the meantime slightly declined, from 2^- thousand million dollars in 1913 to 2 l/5th thousand million dollars in 1929.(ii) Australia.72. According to the 1921 census of the Commonwealth, 97-7 per cent, of the population were either born in Australia or in the British Isles. The racial composition of the Australian population is therefore almost entirety British and the maintenance of the predominant British character of the population is safeguarded by the policy of the Commonwealth Government to restrict immigration from countries other than Great Britain. This fact in itself, however, points to the desirability of a steady flow of migrants from this country to Australia, for the reservation of Australia as a field for British settlement can only be justified if settlement is maintained on a reasonable scale.
(iii) Neiv Zealand.73. The population of New Zealand is also preponderantly British and is likely to remain so. Immigration from foreign countries is discouraged and this fact, as in the case of Australia, implies that such new population as New Zealand can absorb should be. provided from this country.(iv) Union of South Africa.74. The problem in South Africa is of a dual character. There is, on the one hand, the situation arising from the presence of a native population which largely outnumbers the white population. On the other hand, a high proportion of the white population is of non-British stock. It is unnecessary in this Report to do more than call attention to the importance of ensuring that as large a proportion as possible of any addition to the white population of the Union should be of British stock.(d) Importance of Maintaining British Character of the Empire.(i) Mutual Value to the United Kingdom and the Dominions of Empire Trade.75. In Appendix II (Note 16) we give tables showing that trade with the Overseas Empire represents a substantially larger proportion of the total trade of the United Kingdom than it did in 1913. On the other hand, the share, of the United Kingdom in the trade of the Overseas Empire has declined.76. The table in Appendix II (Note 17) shows the value of exports of British jjroduee and manufacture purchased per head of the populations of the Dominions and foreign countries respectively. Even when markets are considered as a whole, it is significant that in 1929 Australia and New Zealand, with a population of under 10 millions together, took twice as large a quantity of United Kingdom exports as did the United States the United Kingdom&apos;s best foreign customer with a population of over 120 millions, and more than any other single customer excepting India.77. The Dominions therefore constitute most valuable markets for United Kingdom trade, and increased population in the Dominions means, other things being equal, improved oversea markets for the products of the United Kingdom.(ii) Empire Security.78. From the point of view of the security of the Dominions, increased population is to them a matter of primary importance. Their sparse populations are not only insufficient to enable them to provide adequately for their own defence, but the very fact that vast areas are inhabited by so few people is in itself a source o! danger. In the case of Canada, proximity to the United States makes this consideration of less importance than in the case of Australia and New Zealand. The position of Australia has already been a matter of concern. By her White Australia policy the Commonwealth has closed her doors to immigrants from the adjacent densely populated Eastern countries, and in practice Australian immigration is confined almost exclusively to persons from the British Isles. It is doubtful whether this policy can be indefinitely maintained unless Australia succeeds in keeping the average rate of increase of population at least up to that which has prevailed during the last half century. The maintenance cf substantial migration from Great Britain to Australia may therefore prove vital in the long run to the avoidance of serious international issues. We. believe, indeed, that the solidarity and internal strength of the British Commonwealth will come to. depend more and more on (lie continued growth of the British elements in the population of the Dominions, and we believe further that the maintenance of tins Empire solidarity is an important factor in maintaining world peace.
(e) Attractions of New World Life to Types unsuited to Industrialised Britain.79. Moreover, there is another point of view to be considered : the point of view of the individual. There are many persons who lack some of the characteristics requisite for success in the conplex and artificial conditions of life in a crowded industrial country. Many of these possess none the less sterling latent qualities which the conditions of life in the New World may call forth. Emigration of such persons may make the difference between a life of failure and frustration and one of honourable usefulness. It is one of the potential advantages of the diversity of conditions existing in the British Commonwealth that it affords the means of securing an appropriate economic environment for the most divergent types of person,.80. There is a general presumption that any- individual who makes up his mind to take the plunge entailed by migration is an individual who feels himself better fitted, and it is therefore likely7 to be better fitted, for life overseas. In this connection, moreover, many of the voluntary societies which concern themselves with furthering migration play a most useful part. As the result of the intimate knowledge which they possess of the persons with whom their work in this country brings them into contact, they are able to pick out those types whose qualities are better adapted for the harder but less sophisticated life of the new world.81. In this way facilities for migration play a useful part in meeting a vital need of human society, which transcends all purely national and Imperial considerations. The sense of frustration which ensues when the only life open to an individual is one that runs against the grain of his nature is perhaps one of the most prolific sources of remediable human misery. To avert this frustration is one of the essential purposes of all social endeavour. It is one of the ideas which underlies and inspires our system of public education; for we seek by means of education to ensure that the powers which an individual has latent in him shall not be denied outlet for lack of early training and development. But when the child has become an adult, we are still faced with the problem of securing a reasonable degree of harmony between his nature and his environment: and one of the main elements in this problem is that infinite variety of character and talent which is one of the chief glories of mankind. It takes, as the phrase goes, all sorts to make a world; and we are glad that it should be so. But the corollary follows that we need a corresponding variety in the environments offered by the world, so that the square pegs of humanity shall not be maimed and thwarted by having to fit in willy-nilly7 to round holes. The march of civilisation and the growing uniformity7 of urban industrial life make it perhaps increasingly7 difficult to supply this variety7 of environment within the limits of the boundaries of a single country. It is the more important, therefore, that we should not neglect the opportunity offered by the diversity of conditions to be found in the British - Commonwealth. We have still need, though in a different sense from Cn.nning&apos;s, to call in the new world to redress the balance of the old.(f) Desirability of Maintaining a Steady Flow of Migration.82. On such grounds as these we think it of great importance that a steady7 flow of British migrants to the Dominions should be maintained. It will be observed that we do not found our case mainly on strictly economic considerations. On the contrary, it seems to us likely, as w7e have argued in Section II, that the future influence of economic forces will be predominantly7 adverse to the development of migration. The likelihood must, therefore, be recognised that migration from the United Kingdom to the Dominions will, in future, be on a substantially smaller scale than it has been in recent years or than on large grounds of Imperial and social policy7 we should like it to be. We turn, therefore, to consider the question of the practical steps which might usefully &apos; be taken with the object of maintaining the steady flow of migration which we think desirable.
PART II. MIGRATION AS A SHORT-PERIODPOLICY.IY. THE METHODS ADOPTED SINCE 1922 BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT TO ENCOURAGE MIGRATION FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM TO THE DOMINIONS.(a) Introductory.83. On the general grounds set out in Part I of this Report, we are satisfied that so long as the present economic depression continues it will not be possible or desirable to incur any considerable expenditure of public funds on migration. We are of opinion, however, that when the depression has passed it will again be desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to grant financial assistance on a substantial scale towards oversea settlement within the Empire. We propose now, therefore, to examine the various methods that have been adopted to this end by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom since the war, and to indicate which are likely to be of most value in the present decade.84. The present policy owes its origin to the Eeport of the Dominions Royal Commission, which was appointed in 1909 to inquire into the development of the natural resources of the Empire and reported in 1917. The Commission was impressed by the resources of the Dominions, and felt that the man-power which was essential to their development should, as far as possible, be drawn from the United Kingdom. The Commission, therefore, urged the need for more effective supervision and direction of migration by co-operation between the Home Government and the Dominions.85. In 1921, a Conference of Prime Ministers of the Empire met to consider the possibilities of State-aided settlement within the Empire, and recommended co-operation between His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and the Dominions, both financially and in all other respects, in a comprehensive policy of Empire land settlement and Empire directed migration. The Conference expressed the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom would secure the powers necessary for carrying out its part in schemes of co-operation, preferably in the form of an Act, which would make it clear that the new policy was intended to be permanent.86. The Empire Settlement Act (see Appendix IV) was passed in 1922 in order to give effect, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were concerned, to the recommendation of the 1921 Conference. This Act declared the intention of His Majesty &apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to pursue a continuous policy in the matter of oversea settlement and their willingness to co-operate financially in schemes calculated to further that object. The assistance given to migration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is mainly governed by this Act, which authorises expenditure on schemes of assisted migration within a statutory limit of  3,000,000 a year provided that at least one-half of the cost of each scheme is derived from some other source than United Kingdom funds, i.e., from one of His Majesty &apos;s Governments in the Dominions or from public or private organisations whether in this country or overseas. As we show  in later paragraphs   (paragraphs and       ),  certainexpenditure outside the scope of the Act has been incurred by the Ministry of Labour.87. The net expenditure (i.e., expenditure after the deduction of sums received in repayment of loans advanced) under tho   Empire   Settlement   Act   up   to   the   31st   March,   1931,
amounts to  6,003,727. The various headings -under which this expenditure was incurred are given in Appendix II (Note 14). The total number of persons assisted to proceed overseas under the Empire Settlement Act up to the 31st March, 1931, was 400,599, and the average expenditure per migrant was, therefore, approxi-mately  15, or slightly less if credit is taken for anticipated recovery of loans. The total expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Labour upon oversea settlement up to the 31st March, 1931, amounted to  786,355 (made up of Training  493,868, Passages  99,954, Miscellaneous  30,468, Canadian Harvesters&apos; Scheme, 1928,  162,070).88. It has sometimes been stated that the Empire Settle-ment Act has failed. To this view we are unable to subscribe. The Act has been instrumental in assisting 400,000 people to settle overseas during the past nine years, and though a considerable proportion of this number would have migrated without Govern-ment assistance, it is beyond dispute that never before have settlers gone overseas under such favourable conditions. Under the provisions of the Act many valuable lessons have been learnt in regard to the highly technical problems of migration involving intricate negotiations between the Government in this country and those in the Dominions. Much experience has also been accumulated through co-operation with the Voluntary Migration Societies, whose work lias been fostered and developed through the facilities afforded under the Act. For the first time the problem of settlement overseas has formed the subject of careful and continuous study, and the experience and information accumulated by- the Oversea Settlement Committee and the Oversea Settlement Department of the Dominions Office during the last decade will prove of first importance on resumption of migration on a large scale.89. Before turning to the consideration of the main forms of State-aided migration it may be convenient to indicate&apos; the main divisions in which migrants may broadly be classified. These are : (i) Those who proceed to the Dominions and settle themselves there without any Government assistance whatever; (ii) those who receive no direct Government assistance other than the facilities afforded by special migrant rates in respect of which the Government makes a contribution (for example, the  10 migrant rate to Canada); and (iii) those who receive Government assistance either directly- or through a voluntary society or both. In the yTear 1929 (the last year before the present depression set in), of the total of 106,900 migrants to other parts of the Empire, 34,687, or 32-45 per cent., were in class (i), 33,833, or 31-70 per cent., were in class (ii), and 38,880, or 35-85 per cent., were in class (iii). If, however, migration to Canada, Australia and New Zealand (the principal Dominions concerned) is considered separately, of the total of 88,685 migrants to those three Dominions in 1929, 16,506, or 18-6 per cent., were in class (i), 33,833. or 38-2 per cent., in class (ii), and 88,296, or 48-2 per cent., in class (iii). If Australia and New Zealand are considered alone, the proportion falling in the three classes is 42-2 per cent., nil and 57-8 per cent., respectively. Over four-fifths, therefore, of the migrants to the three Dominions in 1929 received Govern-ment assistance in one form or another.90. Migrants who piay their own fare without any Govern-ment assistance are free from any Government regulations except as regards compliance with the Immigration Regulations of the Dominion Governments (in the case of Canada the necessity of undergoing a medical examination prior to embarkation, and in the case of all the Dominions, that of satisfying the Immigration Authorities on arrival overseas that the migrant is not suffering from disease or otherwise undesirable).(b) Special Reduced Fares for Migrants.91. Although this form of assistance is for convenience placed first, it is in fact the most recent development in the policy of assisted migration.    It represents an attempt to avoid the[5887] e
hampering Government restrictions which are imposed on the ordinary assisted migrant, and the object is to provide a bridge between this country and the Dominions over which persons desiring to settle overseas may pass with the minimum of Govern-ment interference.92. The only arrangement of the kind at present in existence is the,British migrant .4310 ocean passage rate to Canada, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1929. The difference between the ordinary rate of  18 15s Od. and the special  10 rate is shared equally by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the British North Atlantic Steamship Companies. The special rate is available to any bond fide British migrant from the United Kingdom, i.e., to any person who before sailing signs a declaration of his or her intention to reside permanently in Canada. The Canadian Government makes no financial contribu-tion towards the cost of providing this rate, but has agreed that persons who pay their own fares at the  10 rate shall be regarded as unassisted migrants and shall be subjected to no other restrictions than those imposed on full-fare paying migrants. In normal times this means that the only formality with which  10 Tate migrants have to comply is that of undergoing a medical examination prior to embarkation. Any special restrictions imposed on full-fare migrants are of course applicable to  10 rate migrants, and as an instance of such special restrictions reference may be made to the Contract Labour Order in Council which was brought into operation in Canada in August 1980 prohibiting the admission except on the authority of the Minister of Immigration of any migrant seeking entry under a contract of employment.93. Experience with the working of a special reduced rate for migrants is confined to the Canadian scheme, which had, however, only been in operation for a year before depression overseas led to a severe falling-off in migration and rendered it impossible to draw any definite conclusions regarding the working of the scheme over a period of years. During the year 1929, however, the number of third-class sailings to Canada, less the number of assisted passages, was 43,948 as against 21,820 in 1928, and a considerable part of this increase was no doubt due to the operation of the special reduced rate.94. It has been suggested during the course of our inquiry that it is desirable to consider whether the Canadian  10 rate arrange-ment might not be extended so as to provide for an inclusive ocean and land rate from any point in the United Kingdom to any part of Canada, or by providing a flat fare ranging from say  7 to  11 to selected points in Canada. It has to be remembered that any reduced rate is applicable not only to those migrants who, without that rate, would have been unable to proceed, but also to all those who would, in the absence of such rate, have been able to pay the full fare. The cost per head of the additional migrants secured by the special rate is therefore not the contribution payable by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the cost of providing the rate, but the total Government contribution divided by the additional number of migrants whatever that may be. A reduced rate could therefore only be justified if it resulted in a substantial increase in the number of migrants benefiting by the rate. Bearing in mind this consideration, we think that it would be worth while to explore the possibility of arranging an inclusive ocean and passage rate on the lines suggested above. We feel, however, that any change in this rate should be deferred until conditions are again favourable for migration and until the  10 rate has been in&apos; operation sufficiently long to enable its value to migration to be judged. From the evidence we have received it would appear probable that the full cost of any further reduction in the Canadian ocean rate would have to be borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.95. It has also been suggested to us that when conditions improve an arrangement should be made on the lines of the Canadian  10 rate for a special migrant fare to Australia and New Zealand.   We doubt, however, whether, apart from the fact
that any reduced fare to Australia and New Zealand on such a scale as to be effective would be much more costly than in the case of Canada, the general conditions of migration to those Dominions are such as to render any arrangement on the lines of the Canadian precedent either practicable or desirable. The journey to Canada is a comparatively short one, and the encourage-ment afforded by a special rate is likely to be much more effective in the case of Canada than in the ease of Australia and New Zealand, having regard to the much longer journey and the more serious venture involved in settlement in those Dominions. In the case of these Dominions also, it seems far more probable than in the case of Canada that, when conditions improve, the Govern-ment assisted passage schemes (paragraph 99 below), which was wider in scope than that of Canada, will again be operated and may enable as many migrants to proceed as those Dominions are likely to require, with the additional advantage that half the cost of assistance will be borne by the oversea Government concerned&apos;. It is important that no action, such as suggestions for a flat rate fare to Australia to which the Commonwealth Government did not contribute, should be taken which would jeopardise the revival of the joint assisted passage arrangements (see paragraph 100 below7).96. The characteristic of special reduced fares as a form of State-aid for migration is that it relieves the migrant of all the restrictions specially imposed on the assisted migrant, which often act as definite deterrents to migration, and make it almost impossible for men who do not w7ish to take up work on the land. Such subsidies to the ocean fares of migrants have therefore many advantages in periods favourable for migration on a large scale and when it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to foster migration to the utmost. When, however, the times are unpro-pitious, people are naturally less inclined to migrate, and the possibility of obtaining a reduced fare is much less likely to be the deciding factor whether they go or whether they stay. In such times, therefore, the migrants w7ho would not have left this country if they could not have obtained a cheap fare form a much smaller proportion of the whole. As, however, they enjoy the reduced fare in common with those who really require it to enable them to go, the expenditure per head in such circumstances tends to increase.97. Under the only scheme so far arranged the  10 rate to Canada the contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom only amounts to  4 per head. It is unlikely that the number of persons influenced to migrate by the cheap fare form as small a proportion of the w7hole as 1 in 3, but even if they did, the cost to the Exchequer would only be  12 per head as compared with an average of  10 Is. at present paid in respect of each assisted migrant. The scheme is therefore financially not unattractive, and its advantages are still more apparent when it is borne in mind that under it the contribution to the fare is the only7 expenditure incurred by7 His Majesty7&apos;s Govern-ment, whereas in the case of the assisted migrant training at an average cost in the case of single men trained at Government centres of  60 per head (exclusive of fares) is often afforded, and in a still larger number of cases aftercare involving considerable expenditure is provided.(c) Special Assisted Passage Schemes arranged with His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions.98. Special assisted passage schemes under which the cost of the assistance provided is shared jointly by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-merits in the United Kingdom and in one of the Dominions apply only to particular classes of settlers acceptable to the Dominion Government concerned.99. In the case of Canada, the scheme applied in 1930 to juveniles for farm work, women for domestic service, and families proceeding for settlement under land settlement schemes or nomi-nated (he., guaranteed a home and employment on arrival) for work[5387] b 2
on the land by friends or relatives already settled in Canada. At the moment this scheme is restricted still further to juveniles and families proceeding under land settlement schemes. Children and juveniles under 18 accepted under this scheme travel free; adults are carried at a reduced fare, varying from , 2 to  8, according to their final destination in Canada.100. The Australian assisted passage scheme applies to persons nominated by relatives or friends in Australia, whether for agri-cultural or other employment, and to certain selected classes, e.g., boy farm workers and domestics. The assisted passage rate for adults is .- 16 10s. and for adults with children under 19 years of age  11 for each person, with further reductions in the case of those under 19 years of age; domestics and children under 12 years of age receive free passages. This scheme is temporarily suspended entirely.101. The New Zealand assisted passage scheme applies to nominated persons, boys for farm work, and women for household service. The cost of passages for all assisted persons over 19 years of age is  11, except that girls and single women and widows without children, if under 40 years of age, receive free passages. All persons under 19 also proceed free of cost. This scheme is at present restricted to limited numbers of juveniles and domestics and to the dependents of persons already settled in New Zealand.102. Under an agreement with the Government of Southern Rhodesia, approved settlers (be., single women domestic helps and farm settlers) receive liberal grants towards the cost of the ocean passage.108. Persons leaving this country under assisted passage schemes are required to satisfy the Dominion authorities in this country as to health and character. The standards with which they are required to comply in order to obtain assistance to proceed over-seas are high and vary as between one Dominion and another and in accordance with the need at different times of the Dominions for particular classes of immigrants. This form of State-aid for migra-tion is, therefore, open to the objection that it is highly selective. On the other hand, it is more easy to control than other forms of Government aid for migration. From the financial point of view it has the great advantage that to a far larger extent than is the case in reduced passage schemes (paragraph 92 above) it ensures that the public money spent secures the migration to the Dominions of persons who would otherwise have stayed at home. It does, therefore, make a real contribution towards increasing the flow to the Dominions of new settlers from this country.104. We feel that there are considerable advantages in main-taining as far as possible these joint assisted passage schemes, especially in a period when the opportunities for migration are likely to be restricted. These schemes are, however, open to the objection, as compared with schemes for special reduced fares for migrants (see paragraphs 91 to 98 above), that the Dominion Governments by virtue of their financial participation impose very definite restrictions so as to limit the grant of assisted passages to specified classes of persons. Where, as in the case of Australia and New Zealand, there exists a nomination system with a wide basis the restriction of assistance in other cases to persons intending to take up work on the land is not a matter of great importance. In the case of Canada, however, the scope of specially assisted passage schemes has been limited to juveniles, domestic servants and persons proceeding to work on the land. It may fairly be doubted whether even in recent years the policy of encouraging especially the immigration of persons for work on the land has really been justified by the relative economic opportunities of agriculture and industry in the Dominions. For owing to the growing efficiency of agricultural methods, the large increase in the agricultural output of the Dominions has not been accompanied by a commensurate increase in the rural population. In Canada the broad effect of the preference given to agricultural immigrants has been to secure a sort of probationary period on the land before immigrants to Canada can obtain entry  into  industrial  or commercial  occupations.    Tho
tendency, that is to say, has been increasingly for Canadians to pass from rural to urban pursuits, while their places on the land are filled by new settlers from abroad. From the point of view of existing Canadians this policy has no doubt certain advantages. Urban occupations are probably on the whole better remunerated and more attractive than labour on the land and it is not unnatural that there should be a disposition in the Dominions to reserve the privileges of the former for either the native-born or those who have been in the country for some time.105. This policy, however, necessarily tends to diminish the proportion of immigrants who are drawn from Great Britain. A highly industrialised country like Great Britain, possessing a high standard of life, cannot hope to compete successfully with the peasant countries of Central and Southern Europe in the supply of emigrants for arduous pioneer agricultural work.* Thus the insistence of Canada on a probationary period on the land for new immigrants is tantamount in practice to an insistence that their immigrants must be drawn in the main from racial stocks whose growing predominance fills them on political grounds with some misgiving. It seems to us, therefore, that the Canadian Govern-ment might well consider whether, if they really desire a substantial proportion of British immigrants, it would not be wise for them to waive their objection to the admission of migrants (other than those intending to take up agriculture and domestic employment) when assisted from British funds. The present severe agri-cultural depression, which must, in any case, make immigration of land-workers peculiarly inappropriate for a considerable time to come, would seem to offer a favourable opportunity for such a reconsideration of policy.106.t It has been suggested to us that persons are deterred from settling overseas by the fear that it will be difficult for them to return to this country if they should desire to do so. It is urged that a valuable psychological effect would be created if it were possible to hold out some inducement to the prospective migrant that he would be able at the end of a specified period, sayr two years, to return to this country at a reduced fare if he found that he was not likely- to be successful overseas. The argument runs that, by offering special inducements for migration in the way of reduced fares, the Government incurs a moral responsibility- for providing for the migrants return to this country if for any reason settlement overseas does not appeal to him, and perhaps even some responsibility for his resettlement in this country.107. At first sight the suggestion of a cheap return fare for migrants is not without attraction, though we doubt- whether the fear which it is designed to allay is as widespread or deep-seated as its advocates believe. It is likely that the provision of such facilities would to some extent stimulate migration, although in the long run it is very doubtful whether the net outward movement would be materially increased. For the positive effect which would be exercised on recruiting in this country would be largely offset by the encouragement to return which the existence of any such special facilities would afford. It is well known that the first two or three years of life in a new country are the most difficult ones, as it is in these years that homesickness and the difficulties which a settler in a new country necessarily has to face have to be overcome. If special facilities were provided to enable migrants to return during the initial period, large numbers would probably take advantage of the opportunity even though they might later regret having done so. The comparative difficulty at present of returning during the first few years makes it necessary for the settler to persevere in his attempt to overcome the initial difficulties of his new life. The knowledge that at the first serious difficulty that he met he could return home at the partial expense of the Government might well operate as a positive discouragement to him to face obstacles and would materially increase the number of* Particulars of immigration into Canada from Central and Southern Europe arc given hi Appendix II, Note. 18.\ For Mr. Cole&apos;s note of dissent on this and the following paragraphs to 113 inclusive, see his reservation at end of the Report (page 50). See also Captain Ellis&apos;s reservation on these paragraphs at end of Report.
failures. Even if the concession were not obtainable until say after two years overseas, many settlers might tackle their difficulties half-heartedly in the knowledge that at the end of that period they would be entitled to a cheap return passage. Speaking generally, we feel that the person who will only go overseas if he can be assured that he will be able to return at a cheap rate had far better never go at all, and that any expenditure of public funds incurred in assisting the migration of such persons is money thrown away.108. It would be difficult to confine a cheap return fare scheme, to persons who had been definitely encouraged to proceed overseas by the offer of special Government-assisted passages, and there is little doubt that it would have to be extended, for example, to persons who pay the ,- 10 rate to Canada, since the provision of that special rate also constitutes an inducement to migration. To effect the object which the advocates of a return passage have in view, the return rate would have to be reasonably low; certainly as low as the outward passage in the case of Canada and probably about half the ordinary fare in the case of Australia and New-Zealand. The numbers of assisted migrants who desired to take advantage of the concession either because they were unsuccessful or because they wished to visit the old country (for it would be impossible to distinguish between the two classes) would probably be considerable and there would be the further expense of the return passage for those (and experience shows that this might well be a large proportion) who desired to return overseas when they found that their prospects of finding employment in this country were less favourable than they had expected. This is the more likely to happen in times of depression like the present when migrants would be tempted to return in larger numbers. The/ whole of this expense would fall on His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, for there is no reason to suppose that the Dominion Governments would be willing to entertain any proposal that they should assist migrants to return to this country, or that they would share in the cost of assisting them out a second time. Moreover, a reduced return passage scheme would not provide for the case of the absolute failure who would probably be unable to afford the cost of the return fare even at a reduced rate. For these reasons we believe that a cheap return fare scheme would stimulate the migration of large numbers of persons unsuited to life overseas who would wish to return to this country, and that therefore the cost of such a scheme would be high and its value slight.109. The existence of special facilities for return would, moreover, exert an unsettling effect on the migrant at the very time when he should be thinking of finally establishing himself in his new country. Young men and boys who have gone out as farm-workers have by the end of two or three years acquired some capital and are normally considering the question of taking land of their own. It would be disastrous at this critical stage of their career to offer them any encouragement to dissipate their capital and to break the connection they have established overseas by returning to this country.110. From time to time there must occur occasions when it is desirable that a migrant who is unable to provide the cost of his fare should be enabled to return to this country without having to undergo the procedure of deportation. In the case of Canada, the arrangement under which the Dominion Government can secure the return of a migrant in exceptional eases on payment of a special low rate to the steamship companies and the comparatively small cost of the journey, which enables relatives and friends in tins country in many cases to provide it, render any further facilities unnecessary. As regards Australia and New Zealand, however, return is admittedly a matter of greater difficulty owing to the higher cost of the passage and the fact that deportation is of rare occurrence. For these Dominions we consider that there might be some advantage in the establishment of a small fund to be placed at the disposal of voluntary societies (to which possibly they should be required to make some contribution) so that where deportation was undesirable migrants might in exceptional cases be enabled to return.
111. For the reasons indicated in the preceding paragraphs, we are unable to recommend that any Government expenditure should be incurred for the purpose of providing any general system of return passages to this country for migrants, whether assisted on the outward journey by the Government or not.112. A second proposal that we have considered is that facilities for a visit to this country at a low rate should be provided for a limited number of assisted migrants who had been overseas for three or four years. We do not consider that the objections set out above apply with equal force to arrangements of this description. The number of cheap passages would, however, require to be limited, a certain number being allotted to each of the voluntary organisations concerned for the benefit of specially deserving migrants who had proceeded overseas under their auspices.113. To sum up, the interest of the individual migrant is the paramount consideration to be borne in mind and this should be safeguarded to the fullest possible extent under any schemes of assisted migration. We do not, however, regard the provision of assistance by the Government, whether directly or indirectly, as involving it in any moral or other responsibility for providing for the return of unsuccessful migrants to this country. The actual decision whether or not to proceed overseas is a matter for the individual. In deciding to go overseas he must take into account the fact that it will be difficult for him to return to this country unless his success overseas is such as to enable him to do so at his own expense. At the same time, we attach great importance to facilitating movement between one part of the Empire and another, and we refer to this matter elsewhere in our Report (paragraphs 180 to 188).(d) Co-operation with Voluntary Organisations under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.(i) Schemes arranged with Voluntary Organisations.114. Arrangements have been made by the Oversea Settlement Department with numerous voluntary organisations and local migration committees for providing passage assistance for persons ineligible under the schemes arranged with the Dominion Govern-ments or for supplementing the assistance available, under those schemes, and also for providing assistance towards the expenses of migration other than passages, e.g., outfit, landing money and for the aftercare of settlers (mainly juveniles and single women) after arrival overseas.115. These, include agreements with recognised juvenile migration societies (e.g., the Salvation Army, Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes) for assisting in the outfitting, reception, settlement and aftercare of children and juveniles going to Canada, Australia and New Zealand with assisted passages under the auspices of the societies; with local Migration Committees and voluntary societies for assisting towards the cost of passage, outfit and incidental expenses of suitable migrants; with the Child Emigration Society for the maintenance of children at the Fairbridge Farm School in Western Australia and with Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes in respect of a similar institution in New South Wales.116. All migrants assisted under any of the foregoing schemes are regarded by the Dominion Authorities as assisted migrants and are required to he approved by the Dominion Immigration Authorities in this country as suitable settlers before they can proceed overseas.117. Apart from migrants who proceed overseas at their own expense under special reduced passage rate arrangements and those who proceed under Government-assisted passage schemes, there remains a considerable number who would be unable to proceed without some additional assistance (whether for passages or incidental expenses) or who could only be sent overseas under careful arrangements for the provision of aftercare. Voluntary organisations fill these gaps.   The activities ei tks-se bodies are
3-2numerous and varied, but broadly speaking they fall into the following classes : (a) Providing   assistance   to   migrants   who   are   ineligibleunder Government schemes, or supplementing the assistance available under Government schemes.(b) Providing training facilities in this country or overseas.(c) Receiving, placing and providing aftercare for certain classesof migrants, mainly juveniles and women.(d) Finding vacancies overseas through affiliated organisations.(iii Value, of Voluntary Organisations.118. Many of the foregoing functions are of a kind that it would be difficult for a Government Department effectively to undertake. It is for example obviously easier for, an unofficial body to make enquiries in regard to need in particular cases, as many sources of information are open to them which are not open to a Government Department. Moreover, they are in a position to take decisions on the merits of such cases without being under the necessity as would be a Government Department-of being prepared later to justify in public the grounds on which their decision was based. Again, after-care overseas could not be carried out satisfactorily by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. In the first place the Dominion Governments would be unlikely to consent to such direct administrative action by His Majesty&apos;s Government within their territories. Further the sympathetic relations that after-care requires cannot be provided byr a Government Department. In doing this work, the societies provide a valuable intermediary between the Government and the assisted migrant and thus enable the Government to divest itself of direct responsibility for providing individual migrants with assistance. We are definitely of the opinion that Government Departments should not, as has been the case with Ministry of Labour trainees, become directly-responsible for assisting individual migrants. For this reason the fullest possible use should be made of the services of voluntary bodies, preferably those with branches or with affiliations overseas. Such bodies should, in any case, be specially selected and approved both by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and by the oversea Government concerned. If circumstances should arise that called for the migration of a large number of persons in a relatively short period, as in the case of the Canadian Harvesting Scheme in 1928, we consider that an unofficial body should deal with individual applicants for assisted passages.119. We are in favour of the policy of making every possible use of voluntary organisations engaged in migration, and we con-sider that where a migrant requires assistance bey-ond that available under Government schemes or where being otherwise suitable he yet cannot proceed owing to lack of means, it is desirable that he should be able to secure such assistance whether by grant or loan through one of a number of approved organisations, which should be required to undertake full responsibility for the placing and after-care of persons assisted through their organisations. As soon as the migrant has actually arrived overseas, the principal task of the voluntary organisations is to assist him in making a success-ful start in his new life. It would be unfortunate if this valuable function were impaired, as it would be, if the voluntary organisations came to be regarded by the migrant principally as&apos; debt-collecting agents. On the other hand, we are confident that if the after-care provided by the voluntary organisations is adequate, the migrant himself will be anxious to redeem the advances which have enabled him to make a new life in the New World.(iii) Co-ordination of Voluntary Organisations and Basis of Govern-ment Assistance. 120. There is, at present, considerable overlapping between the various organisations in existence, some of which were in operation long before the Empire Settlement Act was passed, whereas others have been brought into existence in some cases
on the initiative and with the encouragement of the Government  as part of the Governments policy of stimulating migration. For example, a special society for women was set up which absorbed certain women&apos;s emigration societies which had been in existence for many years, and special bodies have been set up by Churches to co-ordinate the work in connection with the oversea settlement of Church members. There are, however, still a number of bodies engaged in the oversea settlement of women and the same is true of other special classes of migrant. This duplication necessarily leads to wasteful expenditure in connection with overhead charges. It would not be practicable to insist that Government assistance for the migration of a particular class of migrant (e.g., women, juveniles, &amp;c.) should only be given through a single voluntary body, for in the case of many of these bodies migration is only one of a number of functions they perform. For example, a special Branch of the Boy Scout Movement to deal with the migration of any boys who are members of the Scout Movement can be justified on the ground that only by such an arrangement is it possible to secure the co-operation of that Movement in the oversea settlement of its members, as only through a separate branch of the kind can relations with the Scout organisations overseas be established and maintained. The same observations apply to other special juvenile migration societies, e.g., the National Association of Boys&apos; Clubs. Further, there is no doubt that the work of providing detailed aftercare such as that required in the case of boys can best be conducted by a number of separate organisations. If the organisation deals with too large a number of boys as would be the case were any attempt made to centralise the migration of boys in one body the personal touch so essential in aftercare is apt to be lost. Similarly, in so far as the Churches deal with oversea settlement they naturally wish to deal with all classes of migrants who are members of their communion.121. We are, however, convinced that it should be possible to reduce the number of bodies8 engaged in this work or, at any rate, to co-ordinate their activities so as to reduce overhead expenses. There are, for example, a number of organisations dealing with public school boys all conducting separate publicity which might well be fused into one without any loss of efficiency. Many of these organisations are dependent, so far as their migration work is concerned, on grants towards their administrative expenses received from the Oversea Settlement Department, which is there-fore in a position to secure greater co-operation by exerting financial, pressure. In our view the best policy would be for that Department to concentrate assistance on those bodies that have shown their efficiency and to withdraw grants from the less efficient organisations. We realise that it would not be possible to secure any working arrangement between such diverse bodies as (say) the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association and the Salvation Army; but if the number of organisations receiving Government aid were reduced it should be easier to secure greater uniformity in policy and method. In considering the position of the voluntary societies it is important to bear in mind that the supply of money from charitable sources for the purpose of migration is diminishing and is likely to continue to do so. The entry of the Government into the field of assisted migration in 1922 encouraged the view on the part of the charitable public on whom these organisations rely for support that it is no longer necessary for them to contribute towards the cost of this work. So long, however, as the 50/50 principle is enforced the work of the voluntary bodies will be definitely limited by the amount of public subscriptions that they can raise.122. For these reasons we consider that the limitation imposed by the 50/50 principle of the Act should be relaxed in connection with the assistance given by the Government to voluntary societies engaged in migration. So far as concerns the actual assistance pro-vided by the societies to the individual migrant for passage, outfit, &amp;c, it is desirable that the Oversea Settlement Department should be free to defray the whole cost within defined limits. Where, however, the oversea settlement work of a voluntary body relieves it*For list of State-aided Migration Societies, see Appendix V. [5387] f
of expenses in connection with other aspects of its work (e.g., the establishment by a body such as Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes of a farm school for children overseas), or where (as in the case of transporta-tion companies) this work is directly profitable to them, the organisation concerned should bear some part of the cost.123. As regards the administrative expenses of voluntary bodies, the 50/50 principle should also, we consider, be relaxed in the calculation of Government contributions, each case being treated oji its merits. In no case, however, do we think that the whole of the administrative expenses should be provided by the Government. In the case of organisations such as the Salvation Army, which have accumulated funds which have been specially subscribed for the purpose of assisting migration, the organisation should be required to bear a substantial portion of its administrative expenses.(iv) Farm Schools Overseas.124. The scheme arranged with the Child Emigration Society for the maintenance of the Fairbridge Farm School at Pinjarra in Western Australia, provides for children of school age to be brought up under Australian conditions and placed out (the boys in farm work and the girls in household work) when they leave school. Contributions towards the cost of the maintenance of children at this school have been made by the Government of the State of Western Australia and by the Commonwealth Government. An institution on somewhat similar lines has recently been started by Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes in New South Wales.125. The majority of the children who go to the Fairbridge School come from Poor Law Schools in this country or are orphans. There is no doubt that Farm Schools of this descrip-tion afford a very suitable means for the settlement overseas of children of tender age belonging to these classes. The cost per head is, however, high, and, if exchange difficulties, are ignored, works out at Pinjarra, exclusive of capital expenditure, at over  250 (i.e.,  60 per annum for about 4 years). Only about one-fifth of this expenditure is borne by the British Exchequer, and a little more than one-fifth by Australian Government funds.126. The high cost of this form of assisting migration (whether provided by Government or by the charitable public) obviously severely restricts the possibility of establishing further institutions of this description. In any event it is questionable whether oversea Governments would regard with favour any considerable increase in their number. Where, however, the concurrence of the Dominion authorities is forthcoming, we consider that voluntary societies should be encouraged and assisted wherever possible to establish additional Farm Schols.(e) Supplementary Schemes outside the Scope of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.127. In addition to the schemes carried out under the Empire Settlement Act, the Ministry of Labour have arranged a number of supplementary schemes in recent years under which a larger propor-tion than 50 per cent, of the cost and in some cases, the whole cost, was defrayed from the Vote of that Department. These schemes included the provision in certain cases of free passages and incidental expenses for trainees; payments towards the cost of the passages to Canada of approximately 8,500 single men for the Canadian harvest of 1928 (including the payment in whole or in part of the return passages of about half of that number); and the grant of assisted passages for single men and families recruited from the depressed areas in this country for work in Canada. Migration from such areas contributes efficiently to the relief of unemployment. It is desirable that on the resumption of migration consideration should be given to special recruiting in those areas.
(f) Training.128. The Empire Settlement Act, 1922, provides for the pay-ment from public funds of contributions not exceeding 50 per cent, of the cost of training schemes established in this country and in the Dominions. In addition, large sums of public money have been expended outside the scope of the Act by the Ministry of Labour or the establishment and maintenance of centres for training single men in farm work with a view to their settlement on the land overseas.(i) Training in the United Kingdom. (a) Single Men.129. Apart from two small schemes, the Oversea Settlement Department has not been able to undertake training in this country for single men owing to their inability under the Act to contribute more than one-half of the expenditure involved. To meet this difficulty, arrangements were made in the autumn of 1925 for the Ministry of Labour to defray the whole cost of an experimental 6 months&apos; course of training at a residential training centre for a limited number of single young men between the ages of 19 and 25 (up to 29 for ex-Service men), who were willing, after such training, to take up work on the land in either Canada or Australia. Applicants for training were required to be registered as unemployed, and to be unskilled, i.e., men who had no opportunity of learning a skilled trade, and must not have received a course of training at public expense, or financial assistance from the Civil Liabilities Department, or the King&apos;s Fund. The men selected for training were in all cases provisionally approved by a representative of the Dominion authority concerned before being admitted to training.130. In November 1927, the age limit was raised to 35, irrespective of whether the applicant had had war service, and in September 1929, industrial workers, whether in employment or not, were admitted to the scheme, agricultural labourers paid under the Agricultural Wages Act alone being excepted.131. The training centres attempted so far as possible to reproduce Dominion conditions and were equipped with implements, waggons and harness of the types used in Canada and Australia, Among the instructors were men who had first-hand knowledge of Canadian and Australian farming. The training given included instruction in tree-felling and land clearing, fencing and rough carpentering, dairying, the handling of horses and ploughing and general farming. While in training, the men received free board and lodging, an allowance of 5s. a week, and a small amount of kit. Free travelling facilities were given to enable them to report to the training centre and to proceed to their homes at the end of their training course. The average cost per trainee (including passage, &amp;c, but without any allowance for capital expenditure on the centres) amounted to about  50.132. The first centre at Barham House, Claydon, near Ipswich, was opened on the 4th November, 1925, and a second training centre at Weeting Hall, Brandon, Suffolk, was opened in February 1926. At the outset, the course was six months, but was soon reduced to four and was still further reduced in 1926, mainly at the instance of representatives of the Canadian and Australian Governments, to 16 weeks at Brandon and 9 weeks at Claydon, with one week&apos;s embarkation leave at the end in addition. In 1928, the length of the normal training course was fixed at 12 weeks.183. In April 1928, steps were taken to stimulate the numbers of men coming forward who were willing to emigrate to take up land work in Canada with the result that applications for training were received in excess of the capacity of Brandon and Claydon, and arrangements were made to improvise two tented training camps on Forestry Commission land in Norfolk. These were opened in May, with accommodation for 200 men at a time in each. Actual farming, as carried out at the established training centres,[5387] f 2
was not possible, but the men were taught milking and ploughing and were given practice in felling timber, grubbing roots, and clearing land. Training under canvas is only possible during the spring and summer, and the centres were closed in the summer of 1928, at the end of the Canadian season.134. In August 1928, it was decided that the existing facilities should be extended so as to afford opportunities in 1929 for training to a substantially larger number of men. As a result of Lord Lovafs visit to Canada, arrangements were concluded with the Canadian Government for placing on the land in Canada during the spring and summer of 1929 up to 6,000 in number of trained men. Four additional centres were established, namely, at High Lodge, West Tofts and Cranwich all in Norfolk and at Carstairs in Scotland. It became clear, however, as the spring of 1929 advanced that the figure of 6,000 was likely to exceed Canada&apos;s requirements, and, on the representation of the Canadian authorities, the short courses of training were suspended and the men already in training were transferred to long courses. In the spring of 1930 the Canadian Government undertook to place 3,000 trainees on the land, but owing to the world depression found it impossible to place more than one-third of this number. As the present economic depression has developed, conditions both in Australia and Canada have rapidly deteriorated and both Dominions have found it necessary to curtail so far as possible the admission of further immigrants. The work of the training centres is, therefore, at the moment at a standstill.135. The main object of the training schemes for single men is to test the physique and character of intending migrants, to eliminate those who would not make good settlers, and to equip those who pass these tests with some rudimentary knowledge of farm work which will be of help to them on arrival in the Dominions. Experience has shown that there are serious difficulties in regard to training. In the first place, the demand in the Dominions for single male farm workers has been subject to such wide fluctuations that there has always been danger that under any scheme for training large numbers of single men it might be impossible to dispose of the output of the training centres as the men completed their period of training. Difficulties of recruiting on this side have also made it impossible to maintain the centres continuously in full operation. The problem is further complicated by the fact that men can only be sent to Canada in the spring and early summer, and in the absence of a demand from Australia during the winter months training has to be suspended.136. As will -be seen from the table given in Appendix II (Note 15), approximately 38,000 applications for training wrere received from the Employment Exchanges. Of these, only 10,000 entered training, and 8,000 sailed to the Dominions. These figures show how rigorous has been the process of selection before and during training. From this point of view, therefore, training is particularly open to objection from the point of view of this country as being a highly selective process.137. We appreciate the value of a course of training both from the point of view of eliminating unsuitable migrants and also from that of the need for building up the morale and physique of would-be migrants. The uncertain factors for which provision has to be made appear to us to make the expenditure of public money on schemes for training single men for settlement overseas of very questionable value, even at times when there are openings in the Dominions for unmarried farm workers, except perhaps in the case of men who are prepared to pay the cost of their own passage and to deposit the necessary amount before entry into training. This is done under rhe scheme for training single men arranged with the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company under the Empire Settlement Act.138. We do not consider therefore that training facilities should be provided for such men as will require Government assistance towards their passages unless there should arise a firm
demand for single male farm workers from overseas which could not be satisfied without the provision of training facilities; for example, if any Dominion Government were prepared to accept large numbers of single men for land work providing they had some previous experience or had undergone a course of training, we think that the provision of training facilities would be justified. That such a contingency will arise within say the next ten years is, we think, unlikely.139. As a contribution towards the relief of unemployment, the training schemes lost much of their attraction when they ceased to be confined to the unemployed and the unskilled on the admission of industrial workers, whether in employment or not. Even on the revival of emigration on a moderate scale, we consider that from the point of view of this country expenditure on training single men who after training would require assisted or free passages would be much easier to justify in so far as it was definitely restricted not only to the unemployed and the unskilled but to . the unemployed of those industries that have a definite surplus of labour. We realise, however, that there would be great practical difficulties in such a policy from the point of view of securing the co-operation of the Dominions.(b) Single Women.140. As in the case of single men, the Oversea Settlement Department have been hampered by the limitations imposed by the Empire Settlement Act in establishing training centres for women. The only centre established under the Act was that at Market Harborough, to the cost of which the Government of the Common-wealth of Australia contributed 50 per cent.141. Where the need for training hostels for women arose, and where the local migration committee or other organisation concerned was unable to contribute so much as 50 per cent, of the cost of the establishment and maintenance of the hostel, the Ministry of Labour undertook to pay, generally, up to 90 per cent, of the capital outlay and 75 per cent, of the running expenses. Under that arrangement, hostels for women were established during 1929 at Lenzie (near Glasgow), Newcastle, Cardiff and London (Portobello Boad). These centres can, together, accommodate 109 women at a time and the course of training takes from eight to twelve weeks.142. Without some previous experience in household work women cannot qualify for the free or assisted passages available under Government schemes. The provision of women&apos;s training centres therefore means a net addition to the number of women proceeding overseas. So soon, therefore, as there arises an active demand for women for household work overseas, any additional facilities which may be necessary for providing training in domestic service should be provided.(c) Juveniles.148. Schemes have been arranged under the Empire Settle-ment Act with voluntary organisations and with local Migration Committees in co-operation with municipal bodies, for providing preliminary training or testing in farm work for boys with a view to their settlement on the land overseas.144. One hostel for boys was also financed by the Ministry of Labour on a similar basis as for women (paragraph 141) at St. Athans, near Cardiff, in 1929. This training centre ran only for some months and was closed in August of that year. The Department also assisted in a similar way a small summer training camp conducted by the Boy Scouts&apos; Association in Oxfordshire,145. At present the majority of boys proceed overseas without any preliminary testing and as aftercare arrangements have to be provided whether or not preliminary testing has been given, the
question arises whether any expenditure on preliminary testing in this country for boys can be justified. It appears, however, that boys who would not otherwise be accepted for assisted passages are enabled, by undergoing a period of preliminary testing, to satisfy the requirements of the Dominion Authorities. The centres also have a recruiting value both by reason of the local interest which they arouse and by the greater&apos; confidence which a period of preliminary testing inspires in parents. Testing also eliminates a proportion of potential failures and assists the boys&apos; assimilation overseas by the increased feeling of confidence which even a rudimentary acquaintance with farming gives. For these reasons therefore we consider that, assuming that there is an appreciable demand for boys overseas which seems certain to be the case in normal times more extensive facilities should be provided for the preliminary testing of boys in this country. At the same time, care must be taken to avoid creating a situation in which the Dominion Governments would regard preliminary testing as an indispensable qualification for the grant of assistance, which would result in the flow of migration being restricted to the output of the testing centres. The supply of juveniles for these centres would be facilitated if it were found possible to introduce an agricultural background to our system of elementary education (see para-graph    below).(d) Families.146. There remains the question of the provision of training for families for settlement on the land overseas, as to which very little has been done in the past, partly7 owing to the cost involved and the difficulty of finding half the expenditure from other than Government funds and partly because there has been no difficulty in filling the demand for families from those who did not require training or could be accepted without it. Valuable work in training families has been done at the War Office Vocational Training Centre now at Chiseldon and formerly7 at Catterick, where soldiers and their families have been provided with training in agriculture during the last six months of their colour service. The only scheme for training families at present in operation is one arranged in conjunction with the British Legion at Wenvoe, near Cardiff, where there are facilities for training twenty-five families at a time. There is no doubt that family migration under suitable arrangements as to placement and aftercare is the most desirable form of migration. It ensures that males and females proceed overseas almost in equal proportion and it further provides for the migration of children in the care of their natural guardians. Moreover, there is never any shortage of applicants for schemes of family migration. In the event, therefore, of it being clear that there existed a demand for families overseas which could not be satisfied without the provision of training facilities we consider that the necessary facilities should be provided at centres financied if necessary wholly from Govern-ment funds, but preferably under the management of voluntary bodies.(ii) Training Overseas.147. Schemes have also been arranged under the Empire Settlement Act with voluntary7 societies for the maintenance of training and reception centres for boys, in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to which boys proceed on arrival and where they undergo a preparatory course in training in farm work before being placed out in employment.148. In Canada, schemes have been arranged in co-operation with certain of the Provincial Governments for maintaining reception and training centres for boy7s, which provide for a con-tribution of 20 dollars by7 His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for each boy passing through the centres. Training in such cases is confined to boys who are found difficult to place in employment.
149. In co-operation with the 1820 Memorial Settlers&apos; Associa-tion of South Africa, two training farms have been established in the Union for providing training for young men with capital who intend to take up farming. Schemes for providing scholarships for boys to undergo courses at Agricultural Colleges overseas have also been arranged in co-operation with various bodies.150. Facilities for training have also been provided in connection with certain land settlement schemes.(g) Land Settlement Schemes.151. The schemes of land settlement which have been arranged under the Empire Settlement Act are set out in detail in Appendix VI. They vary considerably both as regards the type of settler for whom the scheme was designed, the arrangements for settlement and the financial basis of the scheme. Facilities have been provided for settlers with capital of their own as well as for those without capital; schemes have been concluded both for settlers with previous agricultural experience and for those without such qualifications; group settlement under pioneering conditions has been attempted and schemes have provided for settlement on improved farms; some of the schemes have been under direct Government supervision and others under the tegis of unofficial bodies. In some cases facilities for land settlement have been provided for settlers immediately on arrival, in others after a period spent in acquiring experience in farming in the Dominions.152. It is too early as yet to pronounce a final opinion upon the ultimate value of the results obtained from these schemes either as regards the success of the settlers or the extent to which the advances made will be recovered. The schemes arranged for settlers with capital in Australia may, however, be said to have failed. In some cases, such as the scheme in Victoria, this appears to be mainly due to inefficient administration on the part of the State Government. All the schemes have been handicapped to some extent by reason of the fact that it has been impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, though making a substantial contribution towards the cost, to exercise any control over their administration. The only scheme for settlers without capital and without previous experience in Australia (t.e., the Western Australia Group Settlement Scheme) has been only partially successful. The scheme has had to be suspended owing to the cost having proved far greater than was expected, but large numbers of these settlers are still on their holdings. Their indebtedness to the State of Western Australia has recently been fixed at a figure which averages  1,000 per holding.153. The most satisfactory scheme arranged under the Act has been that known as the Canadian 3,000 Families Scheme. This scheme appears from every point of view to embody those features which experience has shown to be necessary for the successful settlement of persons from this country. The British migrant does not, generally&apos; speaking, make a satisfactory settler under pioneer schemes where the settler has first to clear his own land. He is averse from spending the best part of his life in carving a farm out of the wilderness, and settlement on pioneer lines would only commend itself to the British settler under conditions (such as the preliminary clearing and preparation of the land and the erection of buildings, &amp;c), which would make a scheme of this description as costly as settlement on improved farms. The progressive urbanisation of the people in this country tends to produce fewer than formerly of the type possessing the qualifications, necessary for pioneer work overseas. Nor does there appear to be any reason for supposing that settlement of this type on the group or community system would be successful with British settlers, even if no account were taken of the economic and financial difficulties incidental to settlement of this description. It is true that the greater the organisation the less are the risks attaching to settlement, but organisation implies a degree of control that, in general, settlers from Great Britain are less willing to accept than are those from other European countries.   On the whole, the
British settler appears most likely to be successful if he is inter-mingled with the existing farming population and placed upon an improved or partially improved mixed farm, where he can begin farming as soon as he has acquired local experience.154. We have received evidence advocating settlement by public utility corporations and have examined in detail one scheme for the promotion of a chartered company for the purpose of settling large numbers of single men on mixed farms on land to be acquired in Canada. The basis of this scheme is the co-operation of the settlers under the guidance of the company first in clearing and preparing the land for farming and, when the farms have been created, in producing and selling such products as dairy produce, market garden produce, wheat, flax and sugar. The main problem to be faced in connection with any large-scale settlement scheme of this description is that of marketing. No such scheme can succeed unless the large numbers of settlers suddenly added to a community in one group are able to dispose of their produce in quantities which will enable them to make a living and to repay advances. Apart, however, from marketing, the capital cost of such a scheme would be so heavy7 as to make its success doubtful.155. On these grounds we shoidd be opposed to the expendi-ture of public funds on large-scale schemes of group land settlement overseas, whether for mixed farming or for the production of a single main crop, at least until the world difficulties in regard to agriculture discussed in Part I of our Beport (para-graphs 45 to 51) have materially7 improved.156. One objection to a large-scale group settlement scheme is that it is an endeavour to force the pace of economic development, an attempt which in existing circumstances would be doomed to failure. This objection does not hold to nearly the same extent in the case of dispersed settlement (he., schemes for settlement on improved mixed farms, either singly or in small groups, in settled areas) which suits the normal development of the country and does not complicate local market conditions. We consider that when economic conditions again permit of the conclusion of further schemes on the lines of the 3,000 Families Scheme, wdiether under the auspices of Oversea Governments or under responsible unofficial organisations, a reasonable expenditure by His Majesty&apos;? Government in the United Kingdom would be justified. We include within this class schemes such as that arranged with the Canadian Pacific Baihvay7 Company for providing facilities for acquiring farm? for British settlers who have been employed on the land overseas for a sufficient period to enable them to have acquired the necessary local experience and to have saved some private capital. We think, indeed, that the most hopeful aim for any land settlement policy is to be found in the provision of facilities for the acquisition of farms for settlers who have in the first instance gone overseas for placement as farm workers, and have acquired local experience and saved some capital of their own. We feel that some provision of this description is particularly desirable in the case of boys placed on farms overseas where local legislation does not already provide, or makes insufficient provision for, settlers to acquire farms of their own.157. As regards the financing of land settlement schemes, we are in favour of the maintenance of the principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should not contribute more than 50 per cent, of the cost, but we are of opinion that account should be taken in calculating the cost of such schemes of contributions other than cash, e.g., contributions in the form of land provided, supervisory and administrative expenses, in such manner as may be agreed upon between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom and the Dominion Governments or other approved agencies overseas.158. We have already  indicated our view in regard to land settlement in the earlier portion of our Beport when discussing the future of Empire Migration, and it is not necessary here to re-state our argument.    In general, we hold that the present
severe agricultural depression must in any case make land settle-ment schemes in the Dominions on any considerable scale peculiarly inappropriate for a considerable time to come. In so far, however, as openings for land settlement do arise, we are of opinion that dispersed settlement (paragraph ) offers the best chance of success to British migrants, and we consider that advantage should be taken to co-operate in any small and well conceived schemes of this character.(h) Development Schemes.159. The only example of a devolopment scheme arranged under the Empire Settlement Act is the Migration and Settlement Agreement negotiated in 1925 with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia (usually known as the  34,000,000 Agreement). Under this Agreement, the Commonwealth Govern-ment undertakes to raise loans not exceeding in the aggregate  34,000,000 (including the loans of  14,000,000 provided for under the land settlement agreements previously arranged with the States of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia (see Appendix VI) ) for developments which tend directly oi indirectly to increase the opportunities for settlement of persons from the United Kingdom. The methods by which these develop-ments may be carried out include the acquisition, resumption and clearing of land suitable for farms; advances to settlers for the purchase of stock and equipment, &amp;c.; advances to farmers for \he erection of cottages for employees; farm settlement; afforestation-Jon; construction of certain public works, e.g., railways, roads, bridges, irrigation and hydro-electric works, irrigation farms; and similar enterprises tending to assist development in rural areas. The Agreement aimed at the satisfactory settlement in Australia of 450,000 persons from the United Kingdom within 10 years. The contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom takes the form of a payment of  150,000 for every  750,000 of loan money issued by the Commonwealth Government and expended by the State Governments on approved works of development and settlement. For every contribution of  150,000 toward development schemes, the State Government undertakes that 10,000 assisted migrants shall be satisfactorily settled within the State within 10 years; in respect of contributions towards land settlement schemes, the State obligation is to absorb somewhere within the State one family for every farm created.160. Schemes estimated to cost in all  8,730,254 (including expenditure in respect of the loans provided for the land settle-ment schemes in Victoria and Western Australia amounting to  2,322,518) have so far been approved under this Agreement, and the total liability actually incurred by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the 31st December, 1930, was  1,751,056.161. The development works which have been effected by means of the assistance available under the agreement have no doubt increased the potential absorptive capacity of Australia, but it is doubtful whether, except in Western Australia, these works have, in fact, led to any increase in the number of migrants absorbed by Australia since the Agreement came into operation. Whatever may be the merits of development schemes from other points of view, we are satisfied that expenditure of public money thereon by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom is not justified as part of a migration policy, and we are of opinion, therefore, that no further schemes on the lines of the  34,000,000 Agreement should be concluded.162. In this connection we desire to draw attention to the indirect, but possibly great, importance to migration of scientific research in the Dominions. The discovery of new gold fields or of oil in Australia would cause a large inflow of population into the Commonwealth, and for this reason we are in favour of inter-Empire co-operation in scientific endeavours, such as the recent Imperial Geophysical Survey in Western Australia, tho cost of which was shared between British and Australian funds.[5387]
(i) Publicity, &amp;c.163. The part played by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in the actual recruiting of prospective settlers in the Dominions has been comparatively small, the bulk of the publicity for recruiting being undertaken by the oversea Governments, voluntary organisations and the transportation companies. Government publicity for migration has therefore been confined within narrow limits, and has consisted mainly of(a) the issue of publications giving reliable information to prospective settlers regarding conditions and openings overseas;(b) lectures, the object of which is educational rather than propagandist; and (c) to some extent direct propaganda for recruit-ment. Such publicity as has been undertaken has in the main been conducted by the Ministry of Labour through their Employ-ment Branch and the local Employment Exchanges.164. Modest Government publicity of the type discussed above is desirable if only to give the would-be emigrant a reliable picture of his prospects overseas. For this type of publicity the Oversea Settlement Department is well fitted to supply the necessary information, and the Ministry of Labour with its net-work of branches all over the country provides the obvious official channel for its dissemination. We are doubtful, however, whether any more ambitious programme of Government publicity would be justified. The object of publicity for migration should be to educate the public in regard to the Dominions and the possibilities that they offer, and this is probably as well or better done by general publicity in regard to the Empire, such as that undertaken by the Empire Marketing Board, than by publicity specially directed to migration. When circumstances again become favourable for migration, this form of publicity should prove of real value. It might be to the interest of the Oversea Settlement Department to place additional funds at the disposal of the Empire Marketing Board for the purpose of developing this form of publicity. Its object should be purely educational, and it would, no doubt, prove still more effective if more time were devoted in the elementary and secondary schools to instruction in the history and geography of Empire countries and to the economic possibilities offered by the Dominions. Much might also be achieved by changes in our system of elementary education, the urban character of which tends to produce types to which migration makes little or no appeal. From this point of view we should welcome any developments in the direction of providing juveniles &apos;&apos; with elementary teaching in rural occupations, so as to make boys and girls more adaptable to the miscellaneous occupations of a life on a farm, and to induce a keener interest in country life,&quot; on the lines recommended in the Beport (paragraph 28) of the Maclean Committee on Migration and Social Insurance schemes (Cmd. 2608).Y. SUGGESTED CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT MACHINERY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR ASSISTING EMPIRE  MIGRATION.   &apos;(a) Financial Changes.165. At the Prime Ministers Conference of 1921, His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions (with the exception of that of the Union of South Africa) agreed to co-operate financially with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in a policy of State-aided migration and settlement. So far as the United Kingdom was concerned, this policy was embodied in the Empire Settlement Act passed in the following year. That Act (Appendix IV) authorised His Majesty&apos;s Government in this country to formulate and co-operate in carrying out agreed schemes for affording joint assist-ance to suitable persons in the United Kingdom intending to settle in any part of His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions, provided that in no
case should the contribution from the British Exchequer exceed one-half of the total cost of the scheme. The duration of the Act was limited to a period of fifteen years. The policy embodied in that Act will therefore in any case require to be considered not later than 1937. There are, however, in our view, strong grounds for an earlier review. We have already drawn attention to the difficulties which have been created by the condition that 50 per cent, of the cost of any scheme must be provided by other than United Kingdom Government funds. These difficulties have been experienced in many aspects of migration policy. As regards assisted passages, the 50/50 principle has made it difficult, and often impossible, to assist the migration of persons belonging to classes other than those (e.g., single men for work on the land, women for domestic service, &amp;c.) for whose migration the Dominion Governments were themselves willing to make a financial contri-bution. Difficulties of this kind have arisen, for example, in connection with the migration of the dependents of men already in Canada who were not working on the land and persons willing to migrate to that Dominion for other than agricultural work. The 50/50 principle has caused still greater difficulties in the case of the special agreements arranged with voluntary bodies for the provision of additional assistance, after-care, &amp;c. As regards training of single men at Government centres in this country, none of the Dominions were prepared to contribute financially, and if the principle had been maintained, it would have rendered any such training impossible. In fact, however, steps were taken to enable the Ministry of Labour to undertake the whole cost of such training by taking advantage of the annual Appropriation Act (which gives legislative authority for the expenditure proposed in the Departmental Estimates) to over-ride in this matter the express terms of the Empire Settlement Act. This procedure has, we note, been strongly condemned on more than one occasion by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in his Deports to Parliament on the Appropriation Accounts of the Ministry of Labour.166. The 50/50 principle has thus already proved unworkable and over a considerable field has been abandoned in practice. We consider, therefore, that the earliest opportunity should be taken to amend this part of the Act. In making this recommendation we do not depart from our view that every effort should be made to secure as large a contribution as possible from the Dominions towards the cost of migration schemes, but we feel that in the furtherance of the policy of migration His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should be free to defray such a proportion of the expenditure involved as may appear appropriate in any given case. In this connection we draw a sharp distinction between the following classes of expenditure on migration : (a) Expenditure designed to enable persons to migrate from thiscountry for the purpose of taking up fresh occupations in the Dominions ; under this heading we include expenditure on the following services : (i) passage and incidental expenses before departure;(ii) landing money and reasonable placing, reception,and incidental expenses after arrival, after-care, &amp;c.;(iii) training;(iv) administrative   expenses   of   approved   migrationagencies; and(b) Capital expenditure : (i) on land settlement schemes for the assistance ofmigrants after their arrival in the Dominions; and(ii) on development schemes.167. As regards expenditure falling within class (a) above, we recommend that Parliament should be invited to approve amending[5387] c 2
legislation abolishing the existing statutory proportion and authori-;sing His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to enter into migration agreements with His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions and/or Voluntary Associations. In so far as a financial contribution is required from other than United Kingdom funds under any agreement so made, it should be provided that any contribution that the migrant may be able to make should rank as part of that contribution for the purpose of earning grant from United Kingdom funds.168. Turning to capital expenditure, we recommend that Parliament should maintain the present 50 per cent, principle, but :should be asked to authorise account being taken in the calculation of the cost of such schemes of contributions other than cash, e.g., contributions in the form of land provided, supervisory and adminis-trative expenses in such manner as may be agreed upon between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Dominion Governments or other approved agencies overseas and of any contribution made by the migrant. As regards development schemes, we have already expressed the opinion that no expenditure of public funds would be justified as part of a migration policy.(b) Administrative Changes.169. We have already referred to the anomalies created by the arrangement under which all schemes for Empire migration to which the British contribution exceeds 50 per cent, have been carried out by the Ministry of Labour. No question of principle is involved, and in some cases precisely similar schemes have been administered by the Oversea Settlement Department and the Ministry of Labour, the former being responsible for those in which the Government contribution did not exceed 50 per cent, of the total cost, and the latter those in which it did. This division of responsibility has, as we have explained (para-graph ), been solely due to the desire not to amend the Empire Settlement Act. We have, however, recommended that amending legislation should be introduced as soon as possible to enable the Oversea Settlement Department in approved cases to contribute more than one-half of the cost of migration schemes. It follows as a natural corollary that the arrangement by nvhich, in recent years, part of the work of migration has been conducted by the Ministry of Labour should be terminated as soon as possible, and that, as originally intended by Parliament, responsibility for the administration of the migration policy of the Government should be concentrated in a single Department, viz., the Oversea Settle-ment Department of the Dominions Office.170. In many ways the co-operation of the Ministry of Labour in this matter has, however, proved of great advantage. In particular, the Ministry through its Employment Exchanges has provided a very valuable recruiting machine covering a large proportion of the population. With such facilities in existence it would, in any case, have been uneconomic to have established a separate organisation for the provision of the local machinery required to carry out the Governments polic)&apos; of assisted migration. On the resumption of migration activities, we recommend, there-fore, that arrangements should be made for the Ministry of Labour to continue this part of their migration activities, not as part of their own work, but as the agents, and at the cost, of the Oversea Settlement Department.171. Finally, we would urge that the Dominions Office and the Treasury should take concerted action to secure a high degree of flexibility in the administration of the Act in order that full advantage may be taken of the opportunities for migration that may be expected on the return of prosperity in the Dominions.
PART III.VI. MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS.(a) Irish Immigration into the United Kingdom.172. In Appendix II (Note 12) we give figures showing the trend of population for Ireland as a whole from 1821 to 1921, and from that year for the Irish Free State separately. Since the famine the population of the Free State has been declining in spite of an excess of births over deaths owing to the fact that emigration has removed more than the natural increase. The crude birth-rate has been low for a number of years and has shown no marked tendency of late to decline further. The low birth-rate is due almost wholly to few and late marriages. The fertility of married women shows little change, and there is, therefore, little sign of contraception. The age distribution has reached a condition of approximate stability, and, though the material for the necessary calculation is not available, it can hardly be doubted that there is at least a replacement birth-rate and probably more.173. According to the figures of the Irish Free State Depart-ment of Commerce and Industry, the passenger traffic (British and aliens) between Irish Free State ports and the rest of the British Isles showed an outward balance of 15,253 in 1928. This figure takes no account of the movement across the land frontier. Of the 15,253, however, a substantial number, about 3,400,* were emigrants travelling oversea via United Kingdom ports. Thus the net influx into Great Britain and Northern Ireland via Free State ports may be put at nearly 12,000. (The correction to be made on account of the inclusion of aliens is negligible.) There are no statistics which throw light on the extent of the further influx across the land frontier, which includes not only those who after crossing the frontier remain in Northern Ireland, but also those who move on thence to Glasgow and other places in Great Britain. But it probably amounts to a considerable number.174. It follows that m 1928 for every four persons assisted to go oversea from Great Britain and Northern Ireland there was one immigrant from the Irish Free State who settled in Great Britain and it may be that the proportion of Irish immigrants was even higher.175. The magnitude of this immigration from the Irish Free State into Great Britain and Northern Ireland thus materially reduces the benefits to this country of the emigration resulting from the Empire Settlement Act. We realise that any restriction on the free entry into this country of British citizens from the Irish Free State or from any other Dominion would constitute a striking departure from the historic policy of this country and would require careful consideration before it was raised with the Dominion Governments. We feel, however, that this question merits serious consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. We suggest that, in any case, steps should be taken to obtain such powers as may be necessary to secure fuller statistics, with a view to determining the full extent to which Irish immigration is neutralising the effect of the expenditure  incurred  by  the  Oversea  Settlement  Department.* Altogether some 6,095 Free State emigrants left for oversea destinations Tia United Kingdom ports in 1928; but of these 2,714 embarked from Belfast and Londonderry, most of whom, having presumably entered by Northern Ireland via the land frontier, are not included in the 15,253.
(b) Repatriation of Migrants within the Empire,176. The Immigration Laws of all the Dominions make provision for the deportation to the country of origin of immigrants who become a public charge, at the expense of the Steamship Company by which they were carried to the Dominion. In the latest periods available (1929-80 in the case of Canada and 1980 in that of Australia and New Zealand) the number of such deportations was as follows : 177. On account, mainly, of the present economic depression these figures are abnormally high, but those from Canada are always considerable. From that Dominion, persons can be, and are, deported if they become a public charge, even for a short period during winter unemployment, at any time within five years of their arrival in Canada. Even after the expiry of that period, persons are deported on this, and other grounds, if the Dominion authorities are satisfied that they came within any of the classes of &quot;prohibited immigrant&quot; at the time of their arrival.178. It appears to us inequitable that the Canadian Govern-ment should thus send back to this country migrants who have proceeded to Canada with the encouragement and in many cases with the financial assistance of that Government and who, owing to prevailing economic conditions, have become unemployed and for the time being a public charge, especially when the persons concerned may have been in Canada for as long as five years. We are confirmed in this view by the consideration that there is no restriction on the admission of Canadian and other Dominion citizens into the United Kingdom and no power to deport to the Dominions any British subject born in the Dominions who becomes a charge on public funds in the United Kingdom. As we have pointed out above (paragraphs to ), a considerable number of immigrants enter Great Britain every year from the Irish Free State. Many of these subsequently become a charge on public funds; but there is no power to deport or to recover any part of the cost of their maintenance.179. In our view there is no justification for the continuance of the present one-sided arrangements in this matter, operating as they do to the detriment of the interests of this country. We are strongly of the opinion that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should be free to refuse admission to citizens from the Dominions falling within any of the categories of &quot; prohibited immigrants,&quot; viz., persons with criminal records, insane persons, &amp;c. The repatriation of migrants who become a public charge in any part of the Empire is a more difficult question, which we suggest should be carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, with a view to its being discussed with similar questions, at the next meeting of the Imperial Conference.180. Apart from actual migration, we think it desirable to encourage the freest possible movement of persons between different parts of the Empire. When an Englishman or Scotsman goes to a Dominion for purposes of business travel, as a University lecturer or to take up professional work, and when Dominion citizens visit Great Britain and other parts of the Empire, for similar purposes, something very important is done to develop Empire consciousness and understanding. The visitor both learns and teaches, and what he learns he later passes on to others in his native country.   Such intercourse is less easy withinCanadaAustraliaNew Zealand ...2,850 218 1(c) Facilities for Travel within the Empire.
the British Commonwealth by reason of its far-flung character than within a large compact unit, such as, for example, the United States; and it is the more desirable therefore that everything should be clone to make movement between different parts of the Empire as cheap, expeditious, agreeable and extensive as possible.181. We note with interest certain experiments in regard to Empire tours, &amp;c, which on the one hand result in familiarising representative people in this country with conditions in the Dominions, and on the other provide residents in the Dominions with the opportunity of personal contact with persons from the United Kingdom. We may mention particularly the tours to the Dominions and Colonies by parties of public and secondary school-boys organised by the Public Schools Empire Tour Committee; the visit to Canada of a party of public school girls under the direction of the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women; the recent visit of a party of headmasters of public schools to Canada to acquaint themselves with educational facilities in Canada with a view to encouraging suitable boys to finish their education at Canadian Universities and later enter the professions or business in Canada; and the similar tour of a party of headmistresses of public and secondary girls&apos; schools which followed the tour of the headmasters. We understand also that arrangements are being made under private auspices for a large party of elementary school-boys to visit Canada next year simultaneously with the visit of a party of Canadian schoolboys to this country. Other movements have also contributed to this spread throughout the Empire of a knowledge of its different parts, as, for example, the World Jamboree of Boy Scouts held at Birkenhead. Parties of farmers from some of the Dominions have visited this country and visits to the Dominions by parties of British farmers have also been organised.182. In our view any encouragement which can be given by the Governments both of this country and of the Dominions to stimulate the interchange of visits of this description will have a most valuable effect in increasing the knowledge which each part of the Empire has of other parts of the Commonwealth. We feel that in this connection much might with advantage be done in facilitating and removing any obstacles which stand in the way of the interchange of school teachers. Nothing is more likely to contribute to a better appreciation of the Dominions than the presence in all classes of schools in this country of teachers with first-hand knowledge of conditions in one of the Dominions, and similarly&apos; the presence in schools in the Dominions of teachers who have lived for a time in the United Kingdom should have a most valuable effect in spreading in the Dominions information regarding the United Kingdom.183. These are only instances of the kind of intercourse which we desire to see developed. For this purpose it is obviously desirable that the cost of movement between different parts of the Empire should be reduced to as low a level as possible. Cheap travel facilities should form, indeed, an integral part of the idea of cheap communications within the Empire.(d) Settlement in the Colonial Empire.184. We have not considered in great detail the possibilities of settlement in the Colonies, since the presence of native races in most of them limits the field for white settlement. There are no openings for the white unskilled labourer and only to a very limited extent are there openings for white skilled workers. As a general rule, therefore, there is little or no opportunity in these territories for settlers not possessed of considerable capital. For reasons of climate, moreover, few of these territories can be regarded as suitable for permanent settlement by Europeans. Periodical changes to a more temperate climate are desirable and perhaps essential in the interests of the health of the white settler
and his family and this again implies that settlement is only possible for persons with capital. The resources of these terri-tories are extensive, but capital is required for their development, and they must be regarded as offering only very limited openings for settlers from the United Kingdom.YII. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.(a) Principal Conclusions.185. We submit, for the consideration of the Economic Advisory Council, the following summary of our principal conclusions: Part I. MIGRATION AS A LONG-RANGE PROBLEM.The Economic Aspects of Migration.There is a two-fold assumption underlying the policy of State-aided migration. Firstly, it is assumed that it is to the interest of this country to promote emigration to the Dominions, and, secondly, that it is to the interest of the Dominions to increase their population by receiving immigrants from Great Britain.   (Paragraph 14.)Great Britain and Emigration.The position of Great Britain in regard to emigration is&apos; affected by the trend of the population figures. The birth-rate has fallen rapidly during recent years, more rapidly than the death-rate, and, though the aggregate population has continued to increase up to the present, this increase is dependent on the peculiar age distribution of our present population resulting from the higher birth-rates of previous years. If we were to assume that the fertility rate and the death-rates in the various age groups were to remain at the level of 1928-29, the population would approach a stationary condition by about 1950, even if emigration were to cease altogether. It is a fact which is not sufficiently appreciated that already we have less than a replacement birth-rate. If, for example, all the female children born last year were to survive to the age of 30, there would then bs less women aged 30 than there are to-day.   (Paragraphs 15-18.)If, on the other hand, the fertility rate and the death rates in the various age groups continue to decline as they have done in recent years and there is no emigration, the population will begin to decline in the quinquennium 1938-43.   (Paragraph 19.)In ordinary circumstances a large and continuous flow of emigrants can be only expected from countries where the birth-rate is high and where the population is tending to increase more rapidly than the absorptive power of the domestic economic system. Other conditions upon which the supply of emigrants previously depended have also undergone a radical change within the last generation. Great strides have been made in eliminating the evils of extreme poverty and destitution from the social life of the United Kingdom, and the general standard of living is considerably higher than it was. The higher the standard of life at home and the more extensive the system of social provision, the more difficult and expensive must it be to maintain a substantial flow of emigration.   (Paragraphs 20-22.)In general, it is clear that the historic function of emigration of protecting the standard of living from the pressure of numbers is holms incrfiasinsUv discharged in Great Britain by the declining
The Dominions and Immigration.Assuming that the Dominions were to continue to develop over a period of years at the same average rate in the future as in the past,[5387J htendency of the birth-rate.   From the purely economic standpoint there is no reason to regret this change.   (Paragraph 23.)Emigration, moreover, is a selective process which draws unduly upon those elements in the population of which the country has most need, though the practical importance of this point must not be exaggerated.   (Paragraphs 25-26.)Unemployment has ruled at a high level for a decade, and there attaches to some important and highly-localised industries a substantial surplus cf labour which those industries are unlikely to reabsorb, and a transference of which to other occupations and other districts is a matter of great difficulty. In these circumstances we have for the time being, at all events, a surplus of population relatively to the absorptive powers of our industrial life, and under such conditions we are satisfied that emigration, regarded as a whole, is of definite economic advantage to the State.   (Paragraphs 28-30.)The period of time over which the existence of unemployment makes emigration economically advantageous, despite the falling birth-rate, is, we may hope, a limited one. We cannot take an optimistic view cf the future prospects of our export trade. On the contrary, there are, in our judgment, serious grounds for fearing that our exporting industries may find it increasingly difficult to maintain even their present position. But even though it should prove that cur export trade, so far from recovering, continues to decline further, it by no means fellows that the unemployment which is to-day attributable to our loss cf exports will prove equally persistent. During the post-war decade the difficulties of industries like coal, iron and steel, shipping, shipbuilding, engineering, cotton and other textiles, have subjected the economic life of Great Britain to a quite abnormal strain, and the part which these industries play in our national economic life is so large that we could hardly have hoped to adapt ourselves quickly and easily to a new industrial equilibrium. None the less, new industries and occupations have developed on an important and steadily growing scale, and it does not seem unreasonable to hope that, when world trade improves, Great Britain will gradually succeed in establishing a new industrial equipoise, adjusted to the altered economic circumstances cf the post-war age. The tendency for the population tc approach a stationary level suggests that this should be no extravagant hope. (Paragraphs 31 -34.)Even if, however, we were to reject this view and to assume that Great Britain has entered on a phase of steady economic decline, emigration would provide no satisfactory remedy for such a state of affairs, for under conditions of a stationary or declining population large-scale emigration, drawing, as it must tend to do, primarily on the young and the adventurous, would exert an effect on the average quality of those left behind which could only be viewed with the most serious misgivings.   (Paragraph 35.)The position, therefore, as regards the economic value of emigra-tion to Great Britain would appear to be as follows: (a) That in view of the progressive decline in our birth-rate, andthe likelihood of a gradual readjustment of our industrial life to post-war conditions, it is hardly likely that large-scale emigration would be economically advantageous to us as a long-period policy.(b) That in view of our post-war economic difficulties emigrationwould be economically advantageous for us as an emergency policy for the next few years, though carrying certain disadvantages as a result of its selective tendencies. (Paragraph 38.)
and that immigration from the United Kingdom were to continue to form the same percentage of all immigration, the Dominions might be expected, on the average, to absorb a net immigration from the United Kingdom of 90,000 persons annually, Canada and Australia 40,000 each and New Zealand 10,000. This figure would tend to rise as the population of the Dominions grew, and as the natural increase of the Dominions declined.   (Paragraph 46.)The present depression has fallen upon the Dominions with particular severity and, so long as it lasts, it is clear that- they will offer very little scope for immigrants. The crucial question is whether agriculture in the Dominions is likely to spring forward again buoyantly as soon as the general trade conditions improve. The central feature of the present depression is the extreme severity of the slump in prices of staple agricultural products, which has caused a condition of extreme distress among farmers in the prairie provinces of Canada and, coupled with the low price of wool, on the top of an unsound financial situation, has helped to derange even more seriously the economic life of Australia.   (Paragraph 47.)We think it unlikely that the staple forms of agriculture, and wheat growing in particular, will recover the expansiveness which they displayed in the last decade when the general trade depression passes away. It seems to us more likely that, though there may well be before long a partial recovery from the extremely low prices now prevailing, the production of wheat and other staple agricultural products for world markets will remain in a condition of comparative depression for several years to come.   (Paragraph 50.)Thus, the requirements of the economic situation, so far as it is possible to foresee them, appear to point not to an expansion, but to a contraction of wheat growing, a contraction which is likely to be accomplished only very slowly and painfully.   (Paragraph 51.)The above considerations have an important bearing on the capacity of the Dominions to absorb immigrants; in the near future, for agriculture plays a very large part in the economic life of the Dominions, and their agriculture is in a very large degree concerned with the production of the commodities, notably wheat, which are most severely depressed.   (Paragraph 52.)In view of the severe depression in wheat-growing, it is to be expected that the Dominions, and Canada in particular, will gradually effect a change in the character of their agriculture from the extensive wheat-farming which has been characteristic of the development of the prairie provinces to mixed farming of a more intensive type. For farming of certain types, Great Britain offers many advantages as compared with Canada. (Paragraphs 53 and 54.)The present decade is likely to witness a process of contraction in the characteristic types of Dominion agriculture which will necessarily tend to retard the growth of the general economic life of the Dominions affected. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the Dominions will for many years to come be as ready to welcome new immigrants as they were in the post-war decade, unless there is an unexpectedly rapid development of mineral resources. (Para-graph 55.)To sum up, we are now confronted with a profound disharmony between the economic needs of Great Britain on the one hand, and the Dominions on the other, in regard to migration. Now that it might suit us to send large numbers; of our people to the Dominions, it does not suit the Dominions to receive them. When the time comes that the Dominions will again welcome immigrants, it may not be to our economic interest to supply the need. Thus, the influence of economic forces is likely to be adverse to the develop-ment of Empire migration.   (Paragraphs 36 to 58.)
Other Aspects of Migration.Migration within the British Commonwealth of Nations has important aspects other than those of a purely economic character. (Paragraph 59.)The sense of unity which animates, and is the main connecting link between, the self-governing parts of the British Commonwealth is largely dependent on the preponderance of British stock in the population of the Dominions, and it is of the utmost importance, if the sentiment is to be maintained and the political character of the British Empire is to remain what it has been, that the fresh accessions to the population of the Dominions which take place in future years should contain a large proportion of persons of British origin.   (Paragraph 60.)The large part which Empire trade takes in the total trade of the United Kingdom is also related to the fact that the population of the Dominions have a natural inclination to purchase British goods, and the maintenance and growth of this trade is directly related to the size and character of the populations of the Dominions. (Para-graph 61.)The great differences in the density of the white population of the Empire as between this country and the Dominions are striking. In this country there is. a strong case for the view that, on the grounds of mental and physical development and balance, our population is too dense. On the other hand, the small populations of the Dominions are inadequate, not only for the purpose of the efficient development of the vast territories and resources under their control, but also as a basis for the political, social and industrial super-structure which has been created.   (Paragraphs 62-69.)From the point of view of the security of the Dominions increased population is to them a matter of primary importance. The position of Australia has already been a matter of concern, and the main-tenance of substantial immigration to Australia may, in the long run, prove vital to the avoidance of serious international issues. We believe, indeed, that the solidarity and internal strength of the British Commonwealth will come to depend more and more on the continued growth of the British elements in the population of the Dominions, and we believe, further, that the maintenance of the Empire solidarity is an important factor in maintaining world peace. (Paragraph 78.)The point of view of the individual must also be considered. Facilities for emigration play a useful part in meeting a vital need of human sooiety which transcends all national and Imperial considerations.   (Paragraphs 79-81.)Desirability of Maintaining a Steady Floic of Migration.For the reasons indicated above we think it of great importance that a steady flow of British migrants to the Dominions should be maintained, although the likelihood must be recognised that migration from the United Kingdom to the Dominions will in future be on a substantially smaller scale than it has been in recent years, or than on large grounds of Imperial and social policy we should like it to be.   (Paragraph 82.)
Part II. MIGRATION AS A SHORT-PERIOD POLICY.The Methods adopted since 1922 by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to Encourage Migration from the United Kingdom to the Dominions.On the general grounds set out in Part I of this Report and summarised above, we are satisfied that so long as the present economic depression continues it will not be possible or desirable to incur any considerable expenditure of public funds on migration. We are of opinion, however, that when the depression has passed it will again be desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to grant financial assistance on a substantial scale towards oversea settlement within the Empire.   (Paragraph 83.)The following are our main conclusions in regard to the value of the various ways in which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have encouraged migration since the passing of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.Special Reduced Fares for Migrants.The only arrangement for special reduced fares at present in existence is the  10 ocean-passage rate to Canada for bona fide migrants from the United Kingdom, which has been in operation since the 1st January, 1929. The cost of providing this rate is shared equally between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the British North Atlantic Steamship Companies. The Canadian Government makes no financial contribution towards the cost of providing this rate, but has agreed that persons who pay their own fares at the  10 rate shall be regarded as unassisted migrants and shall be subjected to no other restrictions than those imposed on full-fare paying migrants.   (Paragraph 92.)Under this scheme the contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom only amounts to M per head. It is unlikely that the number of persons influenced to migrate by the cheap fare form as small a proportion of the whole as 1 in 3, but even if they did, the cost to the Exchequer would only be  12 per head, as compared with an average of  10 Is., at present paid in respect of each assisted migrant. The scheme is, therefore, financially not unattractive, and its advantages are still more apparent when it is borne in mind that, under it, the contribution to the fare is the only expenditure incurred by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, whereas in the case of the assisted migrant training at an average cost in the case of single men trained at Government centres of  60 per head (exclusive of fares) is often afforded, and in a still larger number of cases after-care involving considerable expenditure is provided.   (Paragraph 97.)We think that it would be worth while to explore the possibility of arranging an inclusive ocean and land rate to selected points in Canada; but that any change should be deferred until conditions are more favourable to migration and until the  10 rate has been in operation sufficiently long to enable its value to be judged. (Para-graph 94.)We doubt whether the general conditions cf migration to Australia and New Zealand are such as to render any arrangement on the lines of the Canadian  10 rate for a special migrant fare either practicable or desirable. It is important that no action such as suggestions for a flat-rate fare to Australia to which the Common-wealth Government did not contribute should be taken which would jeopardise the renewal of the joint assisted passage arrangements. (Paragraph 95.)
58 special Assisted Passage Schemes arranged with His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions.Special assisted passage schemes, under- which the cost of the assistance provided is shared jointly by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and in one of the Dominions, apply only to particular classes of settlers acceptable to the Dominion Government concerned, Schemes of this kind have been arranged with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Southern Rhodesia. (Paragraphs 98-102.)Though this form of State-aid for migration is open to the objec-tion that it is highly selective, it is much more easy to control than other forms of Government aid for migration. From the financial point of view it has the great advantage that, to a far larger extent than is the case in reduced passage schemes, it ensures that the public money spent secures the migration to the Dominions of persons who would otherwise have stayed at home. It does, therefore, make a real contribution towards increasing the flow to the Dominions of new settlers from this country, and we feel that there are considerable advantages in maintaining, as far as possible, these joint assisted passage schemes.   (Paragraphs 103 and 104.)Co-operation   with  Voluntary  Organisations  under  The empire settlement Act.Arrangements have been made by the Oversea Settlement Department with numerous voluntary organisations and local migration committees for providing passage assistance for persons ineligible under the schemes arranged with the Dominion Govern-ments or for supplementing the assistance available under those schemes, and also for providing assistance towards the expenses of migration other than passages, e.g., outfit, landing money and for the after-care of settlers (mainly juveniles and single women) after arrival overseas.   (Paragraph 114.)For the reasons set out in paragraph 117 we are in favour of the policy of making every possible use of voluntary organisations engaged in migration, and we consider that where a migrant requires assistance beyond that available under Government schemes or where being otherwise suitable he yet cannot proceed owing to lack of means, it is desirable that he should be able to secure such assistance, whether by grant or loan, through cne of a number of approved organisations, which should be required to undertake full responsi-bility for the placing and after-care of persons assisted through their organisations.   (Paragraph 119.)There is, at present, considerable overlapping between the various organisations in existence, some of which were in operation long before the Empire Settlement Act was passed, whereas others have been brought into existence in some cases on the initiative and with the encouragement of the Government as part of the Govern-ment&apos;s policy of stimulating migration. We are convinced that it should be possible to reduce the number of bodies engaged in this work or, at any rate, to co-ordinate their activities so as to reduce overhead expenses. The entry of the Government into the field of assisted migration in 1922 encouraged the view on the part of the charitable public on whom these organisations rely for support that it is no longer necessary for them to contribute towards the cost of this work. So long, however, as the 50/50 principle is enforced the work of the voluntary bodies will be definitely limited by the amount of public subscriptions that they can raise. (Paragraphs 120 and 121.)For these reasons we consider that the limitation imposed by the 50/30 principle of the Act should be relaxed in connection with the assistance given by the Government to voluntary societies engaged in migration. So far as concerns the actual assistance provided by the societies to the individual migrant for passage, outfit, &amp;c, it is desirable that the Oversea Settlement Department should be free to defray the whole cost within defined limits.   (Paragraph 122.)BMWBUIBiaBBWBHtJiWaiMllimHmma
As regards the administrative expenses of voluntary bodies, the 50/50 principle should also, we consider, be relaxed in the calcula-tion of Government contributions, each case being treated on its merits. In no case, however, do we think that the whole of the administrative expenses should be provided by the Government. (Paragraph 123.)Only one scheme has so far been arranged for farm schools overseas, namely, that for the Fairbridge Farm School in Western Australia. There is no doubt that Farm Schools of this description afford a very suitable means for the settlement overseas of children of tender age, though the cost per head is high. Where the con-currence of the Dominion authorities is forthcoming, we consider that voluntary societies should be encouraged and assisted wherever possible to establish additional Farm Schools. (Paragraphs 124-126.)Training in the United Kingdom.The Empire Settlement Act, 1922, provides for the payment from public funds of contributions not exceeding 50 per cent, of the cost of training schemes established in this country and in the Dominions. In addition, large sums of public money have been expended outside the scope of the Act by the Ministry of Labour on the establishment and maintenance of centres for training single men in farm work with a view to their settlement on the land overseas. (Para-graph 128.)We appreciate the value of a course of training, both from the point of view of eliminating unsuitable migrants and also from that of the need for building up the morale and physique of would-be migrants, but the uncertain factorsi for which provision has to be made appear to us to make the expenditure of public money on schemes for training single men for settlement overseas of very questionable value, even at times when there are openings in the Dominions for unmarried farm workers, except perhaps in the case of men who are prepared to pay the cost of their own passage and to deposit the necessary amount before entry into training. We do not consider, therefore, that training facilities should be provided for such men as will require Government assistance towards their passages unless there should arise a firm demand for single male farm workers from overseas which could not be satisfied without the provision of training facilities.   (Paragraphs 137 and 138.)The only centre for the training of single women established under the Empire Settlement Act was that at Market Harborough, to the cost of which the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia contributed 50 per cent. Without some previous experience in household work women cannot qualify for the free or assisted passages available under Government Schemes. So soon, therefore, as there arises an active demand for women for household work overseas, any additional facilities which may be necessary for providing training in domestic service should be provided. (Para-graphs 140-142.)Schemes have been arranged under the Empire Settlement Act with voluntary organisations and with local Migration Committees, in co-operation with municipal bodies, for providing preliminary training or testing in farm work for boys with a view to their settlement on the land overseas. Testing also eliminates a proportion of potential failures and assists the boys&apos; assimilation overseas by the increased feeling of confidence which even a rudimentary acquaintance with farming gives. We consider, therefore, that, assuming that there is an appreciable demand for boys overseas which seems certain to be the case in normal times  more extensive facilities should be provided for the preliminary testing of boys in this country. At the same time, care must be taken to avoid creating a situation in which the Dominion Govern-ments would regard preliminary testing as an indispensable qualifioa-tion for the grant of assistance, which would result in the flow of migration being restricted to the output of the testing centres. (Paragraphs 143-145.)
The only scheme for training families at present in operation is one arranged in conjunction with the British Legion at Ytfenvoe, near Cardiff. There is no doubt that family migration under suitable arrangements as to placement and after-care is the most desirable form of migration. It ensures that males and females proceed over-seas in almost equal proportion, and it further provides for the migration of children in the care of their natural guardians. In the event of it being clear that there existed a demand for families overseas which could not be satisfied without the provision of training facilities, we consider that the necessary facilities should be provided at centres financed, if necessary, wholly from Government funds, but preferably under the management of voluntary bodies. (Para-graph 146.)Land Settlement Schemes.A number of schemes of land settlement have been arranged under the Empire Settlement Act, but it is too early as yet to pronounce a final opinion upon the ultimate value of the results obtained. The most satisfactory scheme is that known as the Canadian 3,000 Families Scheme.   (Paragraphs 151-153.)As regards large-scale settlement by public corporations, the main problem to be faced is that of marketing. No such scheme can succeed unless the large numbers of settlers suddenly added to a community in one group are able to dispose of their produce in quantities which will enable them to make a living and to repay advances. Apart, however, from marketing, the capital cost of such a scheme would be so heavy as to make its success doubtful. For these reasons, we should be opposed to the expenditure of public funds on large-scale schemes of group land settlement overseas, whether for mixed farming or for the production of a single main crop, at least until the world difficulties in regard to agriculture discussed in Part I of our Report (paragraphs 45-51) have materially improved.   (Paragraphs 154 and 155.)Dispersed settlement (i.e., schemes for settlement on improved mixed farms, either singly or in small groups, in settled areas) is not open to the same objections as large-scale group settlement, as it does not in the same way seek to force the pace of economic development. We consider, therefore, that when economic con-ditions again permit of the conclusion of further limited schemes, whether under the auspices of Oversea Governments or under responsible unofficial organisations, a reasonable expenditure by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would be justified. We think, indeed, that the most hopeful aim for any land settlement policy is to be found in the provision of facilities for the acquisition of farms for settlers from the United Kingdom who have, in the first instance, found placement as farm workers, and have acquired local experience and have saved some capital of their own. (Para-graph 156.)As regards the financing of land settlement schemes, we are in favour of the maintenance of the principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should not contribute more than 50 per cent, of the cost, but we are of opinion that account should be taken in calculating the cost of such schemes of contributions other than cash, e.g., contributions in the form of land provided, supervisory and administrative expenses, in such manner as may be agreed upon between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Dominion Governments or other approved agencies overseas.   (Paragraph 157.)Development Schemes.The only example of a development scheme arranged under the Empire Settlement Act is the Migration and Settlement Agreement negotiated in 1925 with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Common-wealth of Australia (usually known as the  34,000,000 Agreement). (Paragraph 159.)
The development works which have been effected by means of the assistance available under the agreement have no doubt increased the potential absorptive capacity of Australia, but it is doubtful whether, except in Western Australia, these works have, in fact, led to any increase in the number of migrants absorbed by Australia since the Agreement came into operation. Whatever may be the merits of development schemes from other points of view, we are satisfied that expenditure of public money thereon by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom is not justified as part of a migration policy, and we are of opinion, therefore, that no further schemes on the lines of the  34,000,000 Agreement should be concluded. (Para-graph 161.)In this connection we desire to draw attention to the indirect, but possibly great, importance to migration of scientific research in the Dominions. The discovery of new gold-fields or of oil in Australia would cause a large inflow of population into the Commonwealth, and for this reason we are in favour of inter-Empire co-operation in scientific endeavours, such as the recent Imperial Geophysical Survey in Western Australia, the cost of which was shared between British and Australian funds.   (Paragraph 162.)Publicity.The object of publicity for migration should be to educate the public in regard to the Dominions and the possibilities that they offer, and this is probably as well or better done by general publicity in regard to the Empire, such as that undertaken by the Empire Marketing Board, than&apos;by publicity specially directed to migration. When circumstances again become favourable for migration, this form of publicity should prove of real value. It might be to the interest of the Oversea Settlement Department to place additional funds at the disposal of the Empire Marketing Board for the purpose of developing this form of publicity.   (Paragraph 164.)Part III__MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS.Irish Immigration into the United Kingdom.In 1928, for every four persons assisted to go oversea from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there was one immigrant from the Irish Free State who settled in Great Britain, and it may be that the proportion of Irish immigrants was even higher. The magnitude of this immigration from the Irish Free State into Great Britain and Northern Ireland thus materially reduces the benefits to this country of the emigration resulting from the Empire Settlement Act. (Para-graphs 174 and 175.)Rejmtriation of Migrants within the Empire.The Immigration Laws of all the Dominions make provision for the deportation to the country of origin of immigrants who become a public charge, at the expense of the Steamship Company by which they were carried to the Dominion. There is, however, no restriction on the admission of Canadian and other Dominion citizens into the United Kingdom, and no power to deport to the Dominions any British subject born in the Dominions who becomes a charge on public funds in the United Kingdom.   (Paragraphs 176-178.)In our view there is no justification for the continuance of the present one-sided arrangements in this matter, operating as they do to the detriment of the interests of this country.   (Paragraph 179.)
Facilities for Travel within the Empire.Apart from actual migration, we think it desirable to encourage the freest possible movement of persons between different parts of the Empire. Cheap travel facilities should form, indeed, an integral part of the idea of cheap communications within the Empire. (Paragraphs 180-183.)Settlement in the Colonial Empire.The resources of the Colonies are extensive; but the presence of native races in most of them limits the field for white settlement. As a general rule, therefore, there is little or no opportunity in these territories for settlers not possessed of considerable capital. These territories must therefore be regarded as offering only very limited openings for settlers from the United Kingdom.   (Paragraph 184.)(b) Principal Recommendations.186. We summarise our principal recommendations as follows: Amendment of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.(a) That Parliament should be invited to approve amending legislation abolishing the statutory proportion as between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Dominions and/or Voluntary Associations in respect of expenditure designed to enable persons to migrate from this country for the purpose of taking up fresh occupations in the Dominions, the expenditure included under this heading being (i) passage and incidental expenses before departure;(ii) landing  money  and reasonable placing,  reception,  andincidental expenses after arrival, after-care, &amp;c.;(iii) training;(iv) administrative expenses of approved migration agencies.*(Paragraphs 165-167.)(b) That in the amending legislation recommended in (a) above, the present principle that not more than 50 per cent, of the cost should be defrayed from United Kingdom funds should be maintained in the case of land settlement and development schemes subject to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom being authorised: (i) To take account in the calculation of the cost of such schemesof contributions other than cash, e.g., contributions in the form of land provided, supervisory and administrative expenses, in such manner as may be agreed upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Dominion Governments or other approved settlement agencies overseas.(ii) To provide a larger proportion than 50 per cent, of thecapital expenditure involved in cases where schemes provide for the payment of 50 per cent, of any loss that may ultimately be incurred from sources other than United Kingdom funds.   (Paragraph 168.)* NOTE. We do not suggest that His Majcsty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should normally undertake the whole cost of such services, but that, in the furtherance of the policy of migration, they should be free to undertake such a proportion of the expenses as may appear appropriate in any given case. We regard it as of importance that every effort should be made to secure as great a degree of financial co-operation as is possible from His Majesty&apos;! Government in the Dominions, particularly in regard to those classes of settlers regarded by them as specially suitable.[5387] i
Administrative Changes.(c) That the arrangement by which, in recent years, part of the work of migration has been conducted by the Ministry of Labour should be terminated as soon as possible, and that responsibility for the administration of the migration policy of the Government should be concentrated in a single Department, viz., the Oversea Settlement Department of the Dominions Office; but that, on the resumption of migration activities, the Ministry of Labour should be invited to continue the migration work which they have conducted through their employment exchanges, not as part of their own work, but as the agents, and at the cost, of the Oversea Settlement Department. (Paragraphs 169 and 170.)(d) That the Dominions Office and the Treasury should take concerted action to secure a high degree of flexibility in the adminis-tration of the Act in order that full advantage may be taken of the opportunities for migration that may be expected on the return of prosperity in the Dominions.   (Paragraph 171.)Irish Immigration into the United Kingdom.(e) That steps should be taken to obtain such powers as may be necessary to secure fuller statistics regarding Irish immigration into the United Kingdom with a view to determining to what extent such immigration is neutralising the effects of the expenditure incurred by the Oversea Settlement Department on migration to the Dominions. (Paragraph 175.)Repatriation of Migrants within the Empire.(f) That the whole question of the repatriation of migrants who become a public charge in any part of the Empire should be carefully, considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, with a view to its being discussed, with similar questions, at the next meeting of the Imperial Conference,   (Paragraph 179.)(Signed)      ASTOK, Chairman.A.

* Reservation by Mr. G. D. H. Cole on Paragraphs 106-113.I have signed the Eeport subject to the following reservation : In my view, a most important factor in making emigration to the Dominions unpopular in Great Britain is the fear in the potential migrants mind that return may be very difficult, or even impossible, even if he proves unsuitable for the life of the country to which he removes, or for any other reason fails to establish a satisfactory home overseas. I believe that, in times when the Dominions offer real opportunities for an increased number of settlers, the amount of migration could be increased if those who are encouraged to migrate were assured that they would have a reasonable chance of being able to return to Great Britain. I do not suggest that this opportunity should be afforded until the emigrant has spent long enough overseas fairly to test his suitability for Dominion life, or that it should remain open indefinitely. But I do suggest that at any time, not less than two years and not more than five years after the migrants departure, he should be entitled to a return fare at a specially reduced rate. I recognise that any provision of this sort would have to be carefully drafted, and, subject to special safeguards against abuse; but I attach great importance to removing from the potential emigrants mind the fear of being marooned in a distant country; and I accordingly recommend that a provision for cheap return fares should be included in schemes of assisted migration. It should be further considered whether this condition shotdd apply also to arrangements for cheap fares, such as the  10 rate to Canada.July 11, 1931.t Reservation by Captain L. F. Ellis on Paragraphs 106-113.The extent to which provision of return facilities would increase (a) the number of oversea settlers, and (b) the number of those wdio would return to this country, must, in the absence of experience, be a matter of opinion. I feel that before a decision is taken one way or another, the question should be far more fully examined than it has been by this Committee. In particular, it is, I think, important to ascertain not only the opinion of Authorities and Associations concerned in oversea settlement work, but also the considered views of social and industrial organisations with a large membership of potential migrants.(Initialled)G.

Calculations submitted by the Oversea Settlement Department regarding the Economic Yalue of Migration, with Comments thereon.It is frequently urged that the State has a definite and measurable financial interest in promoting emigration by reason of the saving to public funds in respect of unemployment pay and poor relief which results when British subjects emigrate. The following attempt to compute this saving was made in a Memorandum submitted to us by the Oversea Settlement Department :  &quot; Any attempt to estimate the average saving to national and/or local funds effected by migration depends on a number of factors, which are not precisely ascertainablo, and the result of such an attempt must necessarily be only approximate. The following is an endeavour to arrive at such an estimate :  (a) The. total payments for benefits out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund during the year ended the 31st December, 1928, amounted to  44,260,606.(b) The average weekly number of insured persons to whom such benefits were paid in that year was 954,000. The average number of registered unemployed (insured and uninsured) was, however, 1,246,000. A test examination has shown that the ratio of claimants to dependents under the insurance scheme is 100 : 112, and the total number of unemployed persons with their dependents was, therefore, approximately 2,640,000.(c) The average cost per head of unemployment insurance spread over the whole number of unemployed and their dependents was, therefore,  16-80 per annum.(d) It may be assumed that in respect of each 100 migrants satisfactorily settled overseas, 90 persons in corresponding categories ceased to draw benefit or to have benefit drawn in respect of them, so that the direct relief to national funds in respect of unemployment insurance per head of migrants is  15-12 in the first year.(e) The amount of poor law relief given to unemployed persons (i.e., persons ordinarily engaged in some regular occupation) and their dependents in 1928 -was  7,962,000, and the number of persons assisted was 593,166, an average of  13-4 per head. The average number of unemployed persons (insured and uninsured) registered at Employment Exchanges during 1928, with their dependents, numbered 2,640,000 (see (6) above), and if the expenditure on Poor Law Belief to unemployed, persons and their dependents is spread over the whole of the registered unemployed, the average expenditure per head on poor law relief amounts, to ^3-00. Assuming, as in paragraph (d) above, that for each 100 migrants. 90.&apos;persons in corresponding categories ceased to require poor law relief or to have poor law relief paid in respect of them, the average amount of saving to the rates in respect of poor relief per head of migrants is  2-7 in-the first year.(/) Adding these figures together, wc get a total saving to national and/or local funds of  18-12 in the first year in respect of each migrant, and of  81-5 in respect of each family, consisting of 4$ persons.(g) If this is capitalised over a period of 5 years, we may estimate thai the total saving to national and/or local funds in respect of each migrant from the United Kingdom satisfactorily settled overseas is  90.(h) It has been stated that to provide one man with one year&apos;s. employment involves an expenditure of  360 on relief works.&quot;This calculation involves two main assumptions :  (1) the assumption set out in sub-section (d) that, for each 100 migrants satisfactorily settled overseas, 90 persons cease to draw benefit or to have benefit drawn in respect of them, and(2) the assumption, implied in sub-section (g), that the saving of benefit thus effected continues, on the average, for about five years.The grounds for the former assumption were thus set out in the Memorandum of the Oversea Settlement Department in the paragraph to which reference is made : &quot; It might perhaps be argued that, assuming that the essential condition of satisfactory settlement is fulfilled; it is preferable to concen-trate on the migration of the unemployed rather than on that of the employed. It seems doubtful, however, whether this is the case. In a country so highly industrialised as Great Britain, a very large proportion o  the available work can be performed by those who might find it difficult, if hot impossible, to settle satisfactorily overseas; that is to say, that if A, who is a better man that B, leaves a job in the United Kingdom to settle oversea and his job is taken by B, it does not at all follow that the immediate result is a loss to British industry-it is more than likely that B can do A&apos;s job quite as well us A, while A will make a satisfactory settlement overseas and thereby both increase the absorptive capacity of his new country and create additional employment (over and above the place he has vacated) in the United Kingdom.   It is true that[5387] K 2
labour is not completely fluid, so that the creation of 100 vacancies in this country by the migration of 100 employed persons does not necessarily mean the immediate employment of 100 persons hitherto unemployed. But in the long run (even over a fairly short period) labour is sufficiently fluid to fill all the vacancies in employment created by migration; there is the further consideration that those who have been in constant employ-ment are likely, on the whole, to make a more satisfactory settlement (and, therefore, a settlement more profitable to this country) than those who have been unemployed. When to this is added the fact that employed persons are generally likely to need less assistance to migrate than unemployed, the balance of advantage would appear to be definitely in the direction of concentrating on the migration of the employed rather than the unemployed. In any case, it would appear to be important (quite apart from considerations arising out of public opinion in the Dominions), to avoid any suggestion that it is desired that the unemployed, rather than the employed, should offer themselves as settlers.&quot;We are unable to accept either the picture of the industrial system or the diagnosis of unemployment which is implied in the above paragraph. The assumption that &quot;if A, who is a better man than B, leaves a job in theUnited Kingdom to settle oversea and his job is taken by B.....it ismore than likely that B can do A&apos;s job quite as well as A &quot; is, in our judgment, only very partially true. It is begging a large question to assume that the emigration of A will entail the employment of B. We have to remember that if an employer has to replace efficient labour by less efficient labour, cheap labour by dear labour, or labour which is suitable for his purposes by labour which is less suitable, the result may be, by raising the costs of his production, to diminish the amount of employment which he is -able to give. Underlying the argument which we have quoted there appears to run the assumption that the total amount of employment available in Great Britain is at any time a fixed and definite quantity quite independent of the costs of production or the efficiency of labour. This assumption is so completely at variance with the essential facts of economic life as to destroy the value of the calculations which are based upon it.The vacancy created, for example, by the emigration of a domestic servant is most unlikely to be filled in such a way as to reduce the numbers of the unemployed. On the contrary, the effect may easily be prejudicial to employment. For the inability to obtain a domestic servant may lead to a diminished demand for other things, such as house accommodation, which, in the economists phrase, are demanded &quot; jointly&quot; with domestic servants. And this illustrates a general principle which is of far-reaching application, riot only is labour &quot; not completely &quot; fluid, but it is so far from being fluid that different kinds of labour are often complementary to, rather than competitive with, one another. To an important extent this would appear to be true of the labour of boys and the labour of adults.The second assumption that the saving of public funds effected by emigra-tion may be expected to continue on the average for five years is admittedly entirely arbitrary, and, in view of the unreliability of the former assumption, needs no detailed consideration.As we have indicated in the text of our Report, we are of opinion that such emigration as it is practicable to promote is likely, provided it is not unfavourably selective in character, to be of some economic advantage to this country for a few years to come. We do not think it possible, however, to compute this advantage in quantitative terms. In so far as the emigrants are drawn from depressed occupations and depressed areas, the relief accruing to public funds as the result of the saving of unemployment pay and public assistance would be real and substantial. If we were to suppose the emigrants to be drawn at random from the community, the relief to public funds would be smaller and more difficult to assess. In so far as emigrants are drawn disproportionately. from occupations, age-groups, &amp;c, where there is no pronounced unemployment in this country, the relief that accrues becomes still smaller and more uncertain. Taking account of these considerations, we are unable to say more as regards emigration in general than that there is, in our judgment, a presumption that for some years to come emigration will, on balance, afford some relief to public funds.We think it desirable to add that, when the inference is drawn or implied -that in so far as the State benefits financially when people emigrate, it must be to the interest of the State to pay money to induce people to emigrate, another assumption is involved. This assumption is that the emigration which is assisted would not have taken place but for the assistance. In fact, however, it is probable that of those who have emigrated in recent years, with the assistance in one form or another of the State, a considerable proportion would have emigrated in any case, and to some extent this must necessarily hold good of all schemes to assist emigration. Even if, therefore, it could safely be assumed that emigration relieved public funds to the extent, say, of  10 per individual emigrant, it could not rightly be inferred that it would pay the State to subsidize emigration to the extent of  10 per individual.

The Commonwealth Government undertook to raise, on behalf of the State Government, the necessary loans, and the contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards the cost of the scheme was to be the payment of a sum equivalent to one-third of the interest on the loans for a period of five years.This scheme had to be suspended so far as the recruitment of additional settlers was concerned owing (a) to the heavy cost of the scheme as a whole to the State Government (the total expenditure on the scheme, including railways, drainage and roads, has amounted to about  9,000,000), (6) the uncertainty in regard to the general economic position of the scheme and the eventual financial position of the settlers. As a result of the enquiries of the State authorities all the holdings have been revalued and the average indebtedness of tho settlers as a result of the revaluation fixed at about  1,000.The number of holdings now in existence is 1,578, of which 1,109 are occupied by migrant settlers and their families. This scheme has been declared as an approved undertaking under the Migration and Settlement Agreement with the Commonwealth Government (see paragraph 159 of our Report) and the contribution made by His Majcsty&apos;s Government in tho United Kingdom is that due under the terms of that Agreement.
(ii) New South Wales Land Settlement Scheme.A scheme was arranged in 1923 between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the Government of New South Wales, for the settlement on farms in that State of 6,U00 settlers from the United Kingdom. The scheme was limited to settlers with . 300 capital of their own and the total number of settlers recruited was 107 with  300 capital and 229 with smaller amounts. Of these, only 38 actually took up farms under the scheme. This scheme has also been declared an approved undertaking under the Development and Migration Agreement.(iii) Victoria Land Settlement Scheme.An Agreement was concluded in November 1923, with the concurrence of the Government of Victoria, between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Government which provided for the settle-ment of 2,000 families on the land in Victoria. 741 migrants with a total capital of nearly  300,000, accompanied in nearly every case by their families, proceeded to Victoria under this scheme and 406 were actually allotted farms, although at the end of 1929 only 261 of these were still on their holdings. Complaints have been received from settlers under this scheme and these complaints are in process of investigation by a Royal Commission appointed by the Government of Victoria.The scheme has been scheduled as an approved undertaking under the Development and Migration Agreement.(iv) Canadian 3,000 Families Scheme.An Agreement was made in 1924 between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Dominion of Canada for the settlement of 3,000 families from the United Kingdom on farms in the various provinces of Canada. The farms were provided by the Dominion Government and advances for the purchase of stock and equipment, up to  300 per settler, were made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.Up to the 1st July, 1930, 3,346 families, comprising 18,074 souls, had proceeded to Canada under this scheme. Of this number, 2,500 families are still on their farms. It is estimated that the total advances made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in respect of this scheme will amount approximately to  650,000.(v) New Brunswick Land Settlement Scheme.A scheme was arranged in 1928 between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Governments of the Dominion of Canada and the Province of New Brunswick for the settlement of 500 families on farms in that Province. The Provincial Government provides the farms, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom advances up to  300 per settler for stock and equipment, and the scheme is administered by the Dominion Government.Up to the 1st July, 1930, 294 families had arrived in New Brunswickunder this scheme and further families are being settled at the rate of about 100 a year.(vi) Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Hudson&apos;s Bay Company LandSettlement Scheme.A Scheme was arranged with the Canadian Pacific Railway and Hudson&apos;s Bay Company in 1929 for the settlement of 200 British families (100 on lands owned by each Company). The Companies provide the farms, on which they undertake to spend 1,200 dollars for improvements and for the erection of suitable buildings. The British Government advances up to 1,000 dollars per settler for the purchase of stock and equipment and for initial expenses. The full 200 families have been settled under this scheme, but for the winter of 1929 and again for that of 1930 it has been found necessary to provide special additional advances for subsistence which have been shared equally by the Government and the Companies.(vii) Canada Boys&apos; Land Settlement Scheme.An Agreement was made in 1927 between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Dominion of Canada (in co-operation with the Provincial Governments) under which the parties agreed to spend  1,000,000 during a period of ten years in making loans to assist young men between 21 and 25 years of age to purchase or lease and equip farms of their own. The scheme was intended to provide opportunities of becoming independent farmers for boys going to Canada as farm learners under schemes arranged or approved by the two Governments. Difficulties in connection with securing the co-operation of the various Provincial Governments have delayed settlement under this scheme.(viii) Clandonald Settlement.An Agreement was entered into with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Scottish Immigrant Aid Society in 1925, under which 120 families have been settled on farms in the Vermilion District of Northern
Alberta, on land purchased by the Society from the Company at a cost of lOOjOOO dollars. &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in: the. United Kingdom have advanced  300 per settler (100,000 dollars in all) for stock and equipment and have shared with the Company and the Society in advances for the erection of cottages. Both the Company&apos;s advances (including the purchase price of the land) and that of His Majesty&apos;s Government are secured by a joint mortgage on the property.(ix) Canadian Pacific Railway: Land Settlement Scheme.An Agreement was concluded with the Canadian Pacific Bailway in 1929 for the settlement, during a period of five years, of 1,000 families, selected from amongst families who had gone to Canada in the first instance as farm workers. Farms are purchased on easy terms from private vendors through the agency of the Company, and an advance not exceeding 1,000 dollars ia provided jointly by the Company and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the purchase of stock and equipment.(x) Southern Rhodesia.An Agreement was concluded in 1925 with the Government of Southern Rhodesia for assisting suitable persons with not less than  500 capital to settle on the land in Southern Rhodesia. A loan not exceeding  600 per settler was provided jointly by the two Governments for permanent improve-ments, and provision was made for a year&apos;s training free of charge to the settler.Of the 281 settlers who arrived in the Colony under this scheme prior to the 31st July, 1929, 155 still remained on their holdings on that date.(xi) Cottage Schemes.Agreements have been made with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and with the White Star Line, in co-operation with the Canadian National Railways, for the erection in rural districts in Canada of cottages (costing approximately 1,000 dollars each) for occupation by British families whilst engaged in farm work for wages. It is hoped that, after occupying a cottage for a year or two, a family will acquire a farm of its own or find an opening elsewhere, thus making the cottages available for further families.

INDIAN ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.INTRODUCTORY  NOTE.The Indian Round Table Conference was inaugurated by His Majesty the King-Emperor at a public session in the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords on 12th November, 1930.After the opening ceremony the Conference devoted five days in plenary session to a debate &quot; on the question whether the future constitution of India should be on a federal or unitary basis.&quot; This general debate ranged over a wide field, but its most striking feature was declarations from delegates from the Indian States opening the way to the consideration of a new federal constitution for India, embracing both British India and Indian States.On the conclusion of the general debate the Conference decided to set up a &quot; Federal Relations Committee to consider the structure of a federal system of government in India as regards relations between Indian States and British India, and relations between Provinces of British India and the Centre, including the question of responsibility at the Centre, and to recommend the main principles to be applied.&quot;It was, however, found more convenient to work through a Committee of the Whole Conference, instead of through this Com-mittee, and the Committee of the Whole set up nine sub-Committees to consider the following questions :- Subject or terms of Reference. ^he^vol1. The   Component   elements   of   the     7 Federation.2. The type of Federal Legislature and the     7 number of Chambers of which it should consist. 3. The powers of the Federal Legislature.     7 4. The number of members composing the   12 Federal Legislature, and if the Legis-lature is of more than one Chamber, of each Chamber and their distribu-tion among the federating units. 5.

9Qffo o USub-Committee No. 1.   (Federal Structure.)Interim Report presented at the JVIeeting of the Committee of the Whole Conference held on 16th December, 1930.Introductory.1. The sub-Gommittee* was appointed to consider and report upon the following four of the Heads of discussion which were framed for the Federal Relations Committee : No. 1. The component elements of the Federation.No. 2. -The type of Federal Legislature and the number of Chambers of which it should consist.No. 3. The powers of the Federal Legislature.No. 6. The constitution, character, powers and responsi-bilities of the Federal Executive.The sub-Committee thought that it would be for the convenience -of the Conference to present an Interim Report dealing, in the first instance, with Nos. 1, 2 and 3 above. In view of the large issues raised by No. 6, which cannot be separated from those connected with the relation of the Federal Executive to the Crown (No. 12 of the Heads of discussion), it appeared to the sub-Committee that this Head, on the discussion of which they are proposing immediately to enter, should form the subject of a separate report.2. The sub-Committee are in a position to report that a most encouraging degree of agreement on the matters comprised in Nos. 1, 2 and 3 has been secured. They recognise that any measure of federation involves for the States sacrifices in a sphere to which they have always attached the greatest importance for practical reasons as well as on grounds of existing treaties and sentiment. Thej&apos; recognise, on the other hand, the natural hesitation-tion of the representatives of British India to accept any form of constitutional change which might be thought to endanger the unity of British India or those positive advantages which are derived from a uniform body of law and administrative practice. All parties of the sub-Committee1 were unanimous in preferring the welfare of India as a whole to the individual claims of the interests they represent and in the conviction that only in the larger unity can the diversity of interests and policies be completely harmonised. The sub-Committee are not dismayed by the criticism which may perhaps be made upon their conclusions, that the links between some parts of the Federation and others are but slender. A new State is not born full grown; it must contain within itself the capacity for growth. The attainment of full maturity must depend upon the efforts and devotion of the statesmen of India herself from whatever territory they may come.* The composition of the sub-Committee is given on page 13.
The sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions are as follows :  Conclusions. I. Component elements of Federation. 3. The component elements of the Federation should be on the one hand(a) the federating Provinces of British India, and on the other hand,(b) such Indian States or groups of States as may enter the Federation. Provision should be made for the subsequent entry from time to time of such further States or groups of States as agree to enter the Federation.The important question of the position of the Crown will require further examination when the relation of the Federal Executive to the Crown is discussed. 4. So far as British India is concerned, the federating organism will be neither the Government of British India as it exists at present, nor autonomous Provinces released from the central tie. The process of Federation will involve the creation of a new State which will derive its powers(a) in part from the powers which the States will agree to concede to the Crown, to be placed at the disposal of the new Federation; and(5) in part from the transfer to it of such of the powers of the Central Indian Government (and also it may be of the Provincial Governments) as may be agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Federation.II. Type of Federal Legislature and the number of Chambers of tohich it shoidd consist.5. The Federal Legislature should consist of two Chambers, each containing representatives of both British India and the States (the proportion which the representatives of British India and of the States should bear to each other will be a matter for subse-quent consideration under Heads not yet referred to the sub-Committee).6. The method whereby the representatives of British India are to be chosen was not referred to this sub-Committee, but Their Plighnesses made it clear that in their opinion the method by which the States&apos; representatives should be chosen will be a matter for the States themselves. If and so long as there are any reserved subjects it will be necessary for the Crown to be represented in both Chambers.7. Differences between the two Chambers might be determined either at a joint session or by other means, by vote, whether by a bare majority or otherwise being a question for discussion at a later stage.
III. Powers of the Federal Legislature.8. A list of subjects provisionally recommended as Federal subjects is appended. This list is framed on the assumption that the Federal Legislature will be clothed with power to legislate upon all the subjects included in it. The inclusion of certain subjects, e.g., Defence and&apos; External Affairs, was not specifically considered, since these subjects in particular, though not exclusively, raise the question of the relations between the Executive in India and the Crown a matter not within the sub-Committee^ terms of reference. It is of the essence of a Federal constitution that the enactments of the Federal Legislature acting within its legal scope should have full force and effect throughout all units comprised in the Federation.9. Provision should be made by some constitutional procedure for additions from time to time to the list of Federal subjects.10. In relation to Federal subjects a distinction is to be drawn between policy and legislation on the one hand and administration on the other. In some Federal systems there is a complete separa-tion between Federal and State agency in the administrative as well as the legislative sphere, but in others the administration is entrusted, subject to certain Federal rights of inspection, etc., to the State authorities. The choice is a matter of convenience rather than of principle, depending Upon conditions existing at the time of federation and the practical advantage or disadvantage of dis-disturbing the status quo. For a variety of reasons there are cases in which States may desire to retain, in those matters in which they agree that the control of policy shall be federal, most of the administrative powers which they exercise at present, but in so far as they continue to exercise those powers, they will do so in conformity with a policy jointly determined and with regulations jointly formulated. Provided that the conditions for a harmonious evolution are established, it is an advantage that there should be a minimum of disturbance in the practical arrangements which already operate.11. The precise delimitation of the functions of the Federal and State Governments respectively in these spheres will be a matter for settlement in respect of each subject by negotiation.12. The sub-Committee are strongly of opinion that there should be only a single Legislature to deal with Federal subjects proper and with any subjects which cannot at present be either federalised or completely provincialised. Such a Legislature will no doubt contain representatives of units of the Federation which will not be concerned with some of the subjects with which it deals. But the partial acceptance of this anomaly is preferable to the diffi-culties and complications involved in any expedient for completely avoiding it, such as the creation of a separate British Indian Legislature with a separate Executive. How to deal with this anomaly will have to be considered at a later stage.St. James&apos;s Palace, London. 12th December, 1930.

W O1. Introductory. The sub-Committee consisted of the following members : British Delegations : The Lord Chancellor (Chairman). Mr. Lees Smith, M.P. The Earl Peel.The Right Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., M.P. The Marquess of Reading. The Marquess of Lothian.Indian States Delegation : H.H. The Maharaja of Bikaner. H.H. The Nawab of Bhopal.Nawab Sir Muhammad Akbar Hydari, Hyderabad. Sir Mirza M. Ismail, Mysore.Colonel Haksar, Special Organisation, Chamber of Princes.British India Delegation : The Right Hon. Srinivasa Sastri, Madras.Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, Madras.Diwan Bahadur Ramaswami Mudaliyar, Madras.Mr. Jayakar, Bombay.Mr. M. A. Jinnah, Bombay.Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, United Provinces.Mr. T. F. Gavin Jones, United Provinces.Sir Muhammad Shafi, Punjab.Sardar Sahib Ujjal Singh, Punjab.Sir Saved Sultan Ahmed, Bihar and Orissa.In addition, Sir B. N. Mitra attended most of the meetings of the sub-Committee and gave it the benefit of his advice and assistance.
2. It must be clearly understood that although, agreement has been reached by a majority of the sub-Committee on many important matters, such agreement is only provisional, and every member followed the example of Lord Reading, who said that the under-standing had been from the outset that it would be open to all members, when they came to consider the complete proposals for the Federal constitution, to modify or change any provisional assent they might have hitherto given.  Every member of the sub-Committee reserves to himself the right of modifying his opinion before the final picture is completed. This is the attitude of British and Indian members alike.  Over and above that, upon the basic assumption set out in paragraph 8, Lord Peel and Sir Samuel Hoare, with the infor-mation at their disposal, and with so many questions still undecided, are unconvinced that the kind of Executive envisaged in this Report can be successfully adapted to the special conditions of an All-India Federation.  They, therefore, desire to see further explored methods for increasing Indian control over the Federal Government that are better suited to All-India needs than those founded upon British precedents.  Apart from this Lord Peel and Sir Samuel Hoare are not satisfied that the safeguards recommended for securing Imperial obligations will prove effective, and, in particular, they fear that the financial proposals outlined in paragraphs 18 to 22 inclusive will disturb the confidence of the commercial classes and impair the stability of Indian credit.   They wish, however, to place on record their appreciation of the progress that has been made in the elucida-tion of a contentious and difficult problem, and their readiness to co-operate with sympathetic and unprejudiced minds in its further investigation.Upon the question of finance, Indian opinion was that even the safeguards set out in the Report went too far, especially those giving special powers to the Governor-General.3. The vexed Hindu-Muslim question was referred to by Sir Muhammad Shafi on behalf of the Muslim Delegation, and he made it clear that as far as he was concerned he could not consent finally to frame any constitution unless the Hindu-Muslim question was settled. To this view Mr. Jinnah gave his adherence, on the ground that no constitution would work unless it embodied provisions which gave a sense of security to the Muslims and other minorities. He further objected to some details of the Report. Other Delegates, again, stated that their final opinion upon details was not yet formed, and that they desired, before they came to a conclusion, to ascertain public opinion upon such details, both in India and in England.4. The Indian States do not desire either to discuss or vote upon questions which concern British India alone, and are of opinion that these questions should be definitely excluded.   Nor do the
Indian States contemplate that any question of paramountcy will come at any time within the purview of the Federal Government.The sub-Committee publish the Report subject to these reservations.5. In their interim Report of 12th December, the sub-Committee indicated their view of the component elements of the Federation,, which is contemplated as the future polity for India, and recom-mended that these elements should be represented in both Chambers of a bicameral Federal Legislature. They also put forward a provisional list (which is reproduced in the Appendices referred to in paragraph 37 of this Report) of the subjects upon which this Legislature should be empowered to pass laws having application throughout all units comprised in the Federation. In a later part of the present Report it will be the duty of the sub-Committee to supplement the provisional recommendations thus made with regard to the competence of the Federal Legislature. There are-some matters which, although the Federal Government and Legis-lature will not at present have jurisdiction in respect of them in the Indian States, will none the less require co-ordination in the areas comprised by the British Indian units of the Federation. These subjects also are indicated in the Appendices referred to in paragraph 37 of this Report. The sub-Committee desire in this, connection to emphasise once more the conviction, to which they gave expression in paragraph 12 of their previous Report, that it is the Federal Legislature itself which should perform this co-ordination -ing function. Their reasons for this view are in part the desire to avoid the inevitable complexities which would arise from setting up a separate authority to deal with subjects not completely federalised, but an even more important reason is that it is, in the sub-Committee^ opinion, essential to the development of the Federal idea that the new constitution should contain within itself facilities for its own development, and that nothing should be done in designing the structure embodying it which would be calculated to hamper the natural evolution of a Greater India.The further Heads which were referred to the sub-Committee and are now under discussion are : (4) The number of members composing each Chamber of the Federal Legislature, and their distribution among the federating units ;(5) The method whereby representatives from British India and from the Indian States are to be chosen ; and(6) The constitution, character, powers and responsibilities of the Federal Executive.These three Heads the Sub-Committee now proceed to discuss.
6. The sub-Committee do not, of course, claim to have evolved in all its details a complete plan for the Federal constitution. They consider that the best service they can render to the Conference is to state certain general principles and record conclusions on certain points with regard to which there appeared to be general or sub-stantial agreement, and then to indicate the lines which further detailed examination on the subject ought, in their view, to follow. Many points have necessarily been left open which will have to be settled later after public opinion both in India and in England has had an opportunity of expressing itself upon them, in order that the completed constitution may be based on the largest measure of public approval in both countries.1THE EXECUTIVE.7. The sub-Committee consider that it will be convenient to deal, in the first instance, with the last of the three Heads, namely :Head (6). The composition, character, powers and responsibility of the Federal Executive ; since, as was more than once pointed out in the course of their deliberations, the view taken upon these matters may materially affect decisions upon the structure of the Legislature, the nature of its functions and the methods adopted for enabling these functions to be performed.8. Responsibility of the Executive. The Report which follows proceeds on the basic assumption that the constitution will recognise the principle that, subject to certain special provisions more particularly specified hereafter, the responsibility for the Federal Government of India will in future rest upon Indians themselves.9. Method of providing for this. In the opinion of the sub-Com-mittee the proper method of giving effect to this principle is, following the precedent of all the Dominion constitutions^ to provide that executive power and authority shall vest in the Crown, or in the Governor-General as representing the Crown, and that there shall be a Council of Ministers appointed by the Governor-General and holding office at his pleasure to aid and advise him. The Governor-General&apos;s Instrument of Instructions will then direct him to appoint as his Ministers those persons who command the confidence of the Legislature, and the Governor-General, in complying with this direction, will, of course, follow the convention firmly established in constitutional practice throughout the British Commonwealth of inviting one Minister to form a Government and requesting him to submit a list of his proposed colleagues* e.g. Ss. 9 to 11 of the British North America Act, 1S67 ; Ss. 8 and 9 of the Union of South Africa Act, 190S ; Ss. 61 and 62 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution, 1900.
10. Definition of Responsibility. The Governor-General, having thus chosen as his Ministers persons who possess the confidence of the Legislature, it follows that they will retain office only so long as they retain that confidence. This is what the sub-Committee understand by the responsibility of Government to Legislature, in the sense in which that expression is used throughout the British Commonwealth. The expression also implies in their view that the ministry are responsible collectively and not as individuals, and that they stand or fall together.11. Safeguards.- It is, however, admitted that this broad state-ment of the principle of responsible government at the Centre, which will be the ultimate achievement of the constitution now to be framed, requires some qualification. There was general agreement in the sub-Corrrrnittee that the assumption by India of all the powers and responsibility which have hitherto rested on Parliament cannot be made at one step and that, during a period of transition (i) The Governor-General shall be responsible for Defence and External Relations (including relations with the Indian States outside the federal sphere) and that(ii) in certain situations, hereafter specified, which may arise outside the sphere of those subjects, the Governor-General must be at liberty to act on his own responsibility, and must be given the powers necessary to implement his decisions.12. Governor-General&apos;s advisers on reserved subjects. It was generally agreed that the presence of a person occupying the position of a Minister would be necessary to express the views of the Governor-General on Defence matters in the Legislature, since these will impinge upon strictly federal matters ; the same is true of External Relations but there was not an equal measure of agreement with regard to the appointment of a person to represent the Viceroy in this latter subject. It is clear, however, that the Governor-General must be at liberty to select as his representatives in the reserved sphere any persons whom he may himself choose as best fitted for the purpose, and that on appointment they would, if holding Ministerial portfolios, acquire the right like other Ministers of audience in either Chamber of the Legislature. The suggestion was pressed that any persons so appointed should be regarded as ordinary members of the Council of Ministers, notwithstanding that they would be responsible to the Governor-General and not to the Legislature, and that they should be regarded as liable to dismissal (though they would remain eligible for re-appointment by the Governor-General) with the rest of their colleagues. It is difficult, however, to see how this position could be reconciled with the principle of the collective responsibility of Ministers, and the sub-Committee find themselves unable to come to any definite
conclusions on the matter, though they are 01 opinion that it merits much more careful examination than they have, in the time at their disposal, been able to give to it.13. Position of the Governor-General in relation to his Cabinet.  With this subject is to some degree involved the question of whether the Governor-General should himself preside over the meetings of his Ministers. In the view of the sub-Committee no hard and fast rule can be laid down. It is clear that, especially in the transition period, occasions may often arise in which his presence would be desirable, and indeed, in certain contingencies, necessary. In these circum-stances, it appears to the sub-Committee that the better course would be to provide in his Instructions that he shall preside when he thinks it desirable to do so, leaving the matter to his own discretion and good sense. It is, however, essential that the Governor-General shall be kept at all times fully informed of the state of public affairs and have the right to call for any papers or information which are at his Ministers&apos; disposal.14. Governor-General&apos;s powers in relation to reserved subjects. It follows from the fact that the Governor-General will be himself responsible for the aclministration of the reserved subjects described above, that he should not be dependent for the supply required for them upon the assent of the Legislature, and that the annual supply for their service should be treated, along with other matters to be presently specified, in a manner analogous to the Consolidated Fund Charges in the United Kingdom.   The budget allotment would be settled upon a contract basis for a term of years.  It would further be necessary to empower the Governor-General in the last resort to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the funds required for the reserved subj ects are forthcoming, and also to secure emergency supply for these subjects in excess of the contract budget (e.g., in connection with a sudden outbreak of hostilities on the Frontier). It follows that he should be empowered to secure the enactment of such legislative measures as may be essential for the discharge of his responsibility for these subjects.15. The sub-Committee anticipate that in the event of its becoming necessary to use these powers the Governor-General would not ordinarily do so without considting his Ministers, even though the responsibility for any action taken wall be his and not theirs.16. Governor-General&apos;s special powers. With regard to subjects in the administration of which the Governor-General would normally act on the advice of his Ministers, it was generally agreed that arrangements must be made whereby in the last resort the peace and tranquillity of any part of the country must be secured, serious prejudice to the interests of any section of the population must be avoided, and members of the Public Services must be secured in any
rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. It was further agreed that for these purposes the Governor-General must be empowered to act in responsibility to Parliament and to implement his decisions if occasion so demands by requiring appropriation of revenue to be made, or by legislative enactment.17. Use of the Governor-General&apos;s special powers. Stress was laid in some quarters of the sub-Committee on the necessity of so defining the use of these powers that they should not be brought into play, in derogation of the responsibility of Ministers, for the purpose of day-to-day administration. It is obvious that the Governor-General would consider his relations with his Ministers and the Legislature before making use of these powers. He will have every inducement to stay his hand as long as possible and to be slow to use his own powers in such a way as to enable his Ministers to cast upon him a responsibility which is properly theirs.18. Finance. Special provisions. In the sphere of Finance, the sub-Committee regard it as a fundamental condition of the success of the new constitution that no room should be left for doubts as to the ability of India to maintain her financial stability and credit, both at home and abroad. It would therefore be necessary to reserve to the Governor-General in regard to budgetary arrangements and borrowing such essential powers as would enable him to intervene if methods were being pursued which would, in his opinion, seriously prejudice the credit of India in the money markets of the world. The sub-Committee recommend, with a view to ensuring confidence in the management of Indian credit and currency, that efforts should be made to establish on sure foundations and free from any political influence, as early as may be found possible, a Reserve Bank, which will be entrusted with the management of the currency and exchange. With the same object again, provision should be made requiring the Governor-General&apos;s previous sanction to the introduction of a Bill to amend the Paper Currency or Coinage Acts on the lines of Section 67 of the Government of India Act. They are further agreed that the service of loans, with adequate provision for redemption, by Sinking Funds or otherwise, and the salaries and pensions of persons appointed on guarantees given by the Secretary of State, should be secured, along with the supply required for the Reseryed Departments, as Consolidated Fund Charges.19. With these limitations the sub-Committee do not contemplate any differentiation between the position of the Finance Minister and that of any other Minister responsible to the Legislature, arid In regard to taxation, fiscal&quot;&quot;policy arid expenditure oh objects other than those under the Governor-GeneraTs control, he would be responsible only to the Legislature. In this connection the sub-Committee take note of the proposal that a Statutory Railway Authority should be established, and are of opinion that this should be done, if after expert examination this course seems desirable.
20. The sub-Committee recognise that it may be difficult in existing conditions to set up a Reserve Bank of sufficient strength and equipped with the necessary gold and sterling reserves immediately, and that, therefore, until this has been done some special provisions will be found necessary to secure to the Governor-General adequate control over monetary policy and currency.21. Governor-General&apos;s ordinary powers. The sub-Committee assume that in addition to the special powers indicated above the Governor-General will continue to have, as at present, the right of refusing his assent to legislative measures, and of returning a Bill for reconsideration, and, subject to any Instructions issued to the Governor-General, that the existing powers of reservation and disallowance will remain.22. Bills affecting religion and Commercial discrimination. The question whether Bills relating to such matters as the religion or religious rites and usages of any class of the community should require the Governor-General&apos;s previous sanction to introduction will require consideration, as will also the question of discrimination between different sections of the community in matters of trade and commerce. There was general agreement that in these matters the principle of equality of treatment ought to be established, and various methods were suggested for the purpose. The sub-Committee content themselves, however, with saying that it is one which should be further examined and discussed in consultation with the various interests concerned.23. Breakdown of Constitution. In the event of a situation unhappily arising in which persistent and concerted action has succeeded in making the constitution unworkable, adequate powers will have to be vested in the Governor-General for the purpose of enabling the King&apos;s Government to be carried on.THE LEGISLATURE.STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION.24. Such being their views as to the character and responsibility of the Executive, the sub-Committee are now in a position to consider in relation to these views (4) the number of members composing each Chamber of the Federal Legislature ; and their distribution among the federating units : and(5) the method whereby the representatives from British India and from the Indian States are to be chosen.25. General Principles. The general aim of Federal constitutions has been to provide one legislative chamber which represents primarily all the federating units as such, often on a basis of equal
representation for each unit, and a lower chamber which represents, primarily, the population of the whole federal area : and in applying this plan, constitution-makers have commonly provided that the representatives of the federating units in the distinctively federal chamber shall be chosen by the Governments or Legislatures of those units, while the representatives of the population of the federal area shall be returned by some more popular form of election : it has commonly been provided further that the distinctively federal chamber should be the smaller of the two. But India&apos;s own practical needs and conditions must be the governing factors, and no con-stitution, however theoretically perfect, and however closely modelled upon precedents adopted elsewhere, is likely to survive the tests of experience unless it conforms to the needs and genius of the country which adopts it, and unless it is capable of adaptation and modification as the character of these needs is proved in the working. To meet these needs the federal organisation must be conceived not as a rivalry of conflicting elements, but as a partnership for the devising and efficient application by common consent of policies required in the common interest. For such a partnership the stability of the Federal Government is of the first importance.26. The Upper Chamber. The discussion which took place in the sub-Committee on Heads 4 and 5 proceeded without any prior decision upon the all-important question of the relations between, and the respective powers of, the two chambers ; and it may well be that some of the opinions now provisionally expressed will require revision. But proceeding simply on the basis that there will be two Chambers, the Upper smaller in size than the Lower, and without any decision as to the relations of one to the other, the balance of opinion was to the effect that the Upper Chamber-which might be described as the Senate of the Federal Legislature should be a small body, of from 100 to 150 members, whose qualifications should be such as will ensure that it is a body of weight, experience and character. It was thought that this object might be secured by prescribing for the candidature of the British India members qualifications similar to those now in force for the Council of State : and the sub-Committee have no doubt that the Rulers of the Indian States, in selecting their representatives, will ensure that they are persons of similar standing.Method of election to Upper Chamber. The sub-Committee are almost unanimously of opinion that the British Indian members of the Senate should be elected by the provincial legislatures, by the single transferable vote.27. Life of the Upper Chamber. -The Senate itself should not be subject to dissolution like the Lower House, but a fixed proportion of its members would retire and be replaced (or re-elected as the case may be) at regular periods.
28. Distribution of Seats in Upper Chamber. As regards the distribution of seats in the Senate between the States and British India respectively, the sub-Committee have to report a difference of view. The States representatives on the sub-Committee pressed strongly for equality of distribution as between the States and British India. The British Indian representatives, on the other hand, were disposed to claim, on such grounds as area and population, a preponderance of seats for British India; but though opinions differed as to the precise degree of &quot; weightage &quot; to be conceded to the States, the sub-Committee are unanimous that some &quot; weightage &quot; must be given, and that a distribution of seats as between the States and British India on a strict population ratio would neither be defensible in theory nor desirable in practice. The sub-Committee trust that if the Conference fails to reach unanimity on this point, a satisfactory solution may yet be found as the result of discussion and accommodation hereafter.29. Distribution of Seats in Upper Chamber between Provinces.  Granted a solution of this question, it has still to be considered how the seats available to the States and British India respectively are to be distributed amongst the individual units of each class. So far as the States are concerned, this must clearly be a matter for agreement by their Rulers in consultation between themselves and, if necessary, with the Viceroy. Difficult problems of grouping are involved, but these matters are outside the scope of the Conference. As regards the Provinces, precedents of other Federal constitutions could no doubt be cited in favour of complete equality as between Province and Province, and there was some opinion in the sub-Committee in favour of this plan. But while the opportunity should no doubt be taken for departing from the traditional apportionment as between Province and Province which has survived in the Chambers of the existing Indian Legislature, the sub-Committee are doubtful whether an arrangement which gave, for instance, to Assam with its 1\ millions of inhabitants, and Bengal with its 46J millions, an equal voice in the counsels of the Nation, would commend itself to general public opinion. On the whole the sub-Committee would be disposed to regard a distribution as between Province and Province on a population ratio as the most convenient and satisfactory arrangement.30. The Lower Chamber Size. The trend of opinion as to the size of the Lower Chamber was that it should consist of approximately 300 members, thus providing roughly one representative for each million of the inhabitants of India. On the other hand the view was strongly expressed that the requirements of efficiency would not be met if the Chamber were to exceed 200 as a maximum. The sub-Committee as a whole recognise the force of these considera-tions, and also of the desire for a Chamber of sufficient size to afford a reasonable approach to adequate representation of the population.
9*0  *5j Kj iCBut since no real approach to this latter ideal could be secured without enlarging the Legislature to an undue extent, the sub-Committee think that having regard to the great importance which must be attached to efficiency of working, 250 should be adopted as the number of seats to be provided in the Lower Chamber.31. Distribution of Seats in the Lower Chamber. -In the Lower Chamber the Indian States Delegation do not claim, as they do in the Senate, equality of representation with British India, but here also they claim some greater representation than they would obtain on a strict population ratio. The British Indian representatives on the sub-Committee were not, however, disposed to contemplate a distribution as between themselves and the States in this Chamber on any other basis than that of population. On this basis approx-imately 76 per cent, of the seats would be assigned to British India and 24 per cent, to the States. But while the latter view must be recorded as that of the majority of the sub-Committee, a substantial minority would regard so great a disparity between the two classes of units as inconsistent with and inimical to the ideal which the Conference has set before itself, and the minority wish strongly to urge upon their colleagues the desirability of subordinating theory to expediency in the interests of goodwill. No Conference can hope to bear fruit unless its members approach their task in a spirit of accommodation, and accommodation in this matter is, they are confident, not beyond the reach of Indian statesmanship.The question of the respective powers of the two Chambers, which has been touched upon in para. 26 has also an obvious bearing on the matter.32. Method of election to Lower Chamber. Here again the sub-Committee regret that they are unable to record a unanimous view. The British Indian representatives almost without exception favour direct election by constituencies arranged on a plan generally similar to that of the &quot; general constituencies &quot; for the existing Legislative Assembly. They maintain that this method of election has not proved in practice inconvenient or unworkable, that such incon-venience as it has hitherto presented will be diminished with the increase which they contemplate in the number of seats available and the consequent decrease in the size of constituencies, that ten years&apos; experience has firmly established it in popular favour, and that resort to any method of indirect election would not be accepted by Indian public opinion. Other members of the sub-Committee are unable to contemplate as a fitting repository of power and responsi-bility a Chamber whose members would have so exiguous a link between themselves and the population of the areas they would purport to represent as would be provided by any system of direct election. Assuming for the sake of argument tb at as many as 200 seats were available for British Indian representatives, they note that the
average size of a constituency would be some 4,000 square.re miles, and that if due allowance is made for the comparatively small areas of the urban constituencies, the general average would be even higher. They note that the Franchise sub-Committee have refrained from making any recommendation on the franchise for the Federal Legislature : consequently they cannot bring themselves to regard as popular representation according to the accepted canons of parliamentary government a system which provides for the &quot; election&quot; of members by an average number of some 5,000 electors scattered over an average area of some 4,000 square miles, and this difficulty would not be removed by an increase in the average number of electors by a lowering of the franchise ; for an increase in the number of the voters in such vast constituencies would merely increase the difficulties of establishing contact between the candidate and the voter. But apart from these practical difficulties, some members of the sub-Committee feel strongly that, in the geographical conditions of India, any system of direct election would seriously prejudice the success of the Federal ideal. In their view it is of the utmost importance that the tie between the Centre and the units should be as closely knit as possible ; and that it should be a tie of natural affinity of outlook and interest and capable of counteracting the centrifugal tendencies which, but for such a counterpoise, will be liable to develop in the Provinces from the increased autonomy now in prospect. In the opinion of those who hold this view the only satisfactory basis for representation in either Chamber of the Federal Legislature is election by the Legislatures of the Provinces. This need not involve the mere reproduction of the Lower Chamber on a smaller scale, if, as is suggested in this Report, special qualifications are prescribed for membership of the Senate. But if this plan is not adopted, and the view prevails that the members of the Assembly should be chosen to represent the populations of the units rather than their Govern-ments or Legislatures, those members of the sub-Committee who are opposed to direct election desire to point out that it is not a necessary consequence of a decision in this sense that the populations of the areas should elect their representatives directly. Various devices are know/n to constitution-makers as alternatives to direct election, and they would strongly urge that every possible alternative should be explored before a final decision is taken.33. Life of the Lower Chamber. The sub-Committee are of opinion that the term of the Lower Chamber should be five years, unless sooner dissolved by the Governor-General.34. Representation of special interests and of the Crown in Federal Legislature. Two further points remain to be mentioned in regard to the composition of the Federal Legislature. Opinion was unanimous in the sub-Committee that, subject to any report of the Minorities sub-Committee, provision should be made for the repre-sentation, possibly in both Chambers, and certainly in the Lower
H 25Chamber, of certain special interests, namely, the Depressed Classes, Indian Christians, Europeans, Anglo-Indians, Landlords, Commerce (European and Indian) and Labour. Secondly, in their interim Report, the sub-Committee expressed the view that so long as there are any reserved subjects the Crown should be represented in both Chambers. While the sub-Committee unanimously maintain that recommendation, further discussion has disclosed a difference of view as to the functions of the Crown nominees, and as to their numbers. Some members of the sub-Committee consider that their attendance should be solely for the purpose of explaining the Governor-General&apos;s policy on his behalf, and that they should not exercise the right to vote in divisions. Others are of opinion that these persons should be full members of the Legislature. Some members of the sub-Committee consider again that the only nominees of the Crown should be the principal advisers of the Governor-General in the administration of the reserved subjects, while others think that the Governor-General should be empowered to nominate a specified number of persons, not exceeding, say, 10, to each Chamber.35. Means of securing stability for the Executive. The relation of the two Chambers to one another has been touched on above, but a particular aspect of the relation of the Chambers to the Executive was a subject of discussion in the sub-Committee and should be mentioned here. For the purpose of securing greater stability to the Executive the suggestion was made, and found a large measure of support, that Ministers should not be compelled to resign save in the event of a vote of no confidence passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of the two Chambers sitting together. Ministers against whom less than two-thirds of the votes have been cast on a motion of no confidence would not, however, for that reason alone continue to enjoy to any greater extent than before the confidence of the Legislature who would be still able in other ways to make effective their want of confidence. But the sub-Committee are of opinion that some means should be devised whereby, in the interests of stability, an adverse vote should not on every occasion necessarily involve the resignation of the Ministry, and that the subject should be further explored.36. Position of States&apos; representatives in relation to matters affecting British India only. Since the functions of the Federal Government will extend beyond the range of federal subjects and will embrace those matters which are strictly the concern of British India alone, it has to be decided whether the States&apos; representatives in the Federal Legislature should take any part in the debates and decisions on this latter class of matters with which ex hypothesi they will not be directly concerned. There is much to be said in favour of treating all members of the Federal Legislature as entitled and empowered to contribute their share towards the decision of all matters within
the range of the Legislature^ duties. It would be clearly impossible, so far as the Executive is concerned (which will, like the Legislature, be composed of representatives of both States and British India) to differentiate the functions of Ministers in such a way as to confine the responsibilities of States&apos; representatives to Federal matters ; no workable scheme could be devised with this object which would not cut at the root of the principle of collective responsibility in the Cabinet. For this reason the States desire with the general assent of the sub-Committee that their representatives in the Legislature should play their part equally with their British Indian colleagues in expressing the decision of the Legislature on any question which involves the existence of the Ministry, even if the matter which has given rise to the question of confidence is one which primarily affects British India only. At the same time Their Highnesses would prefer that the States&apos; representatives should take no part in the decision of matters which, being outside the range of federal subjects, have no direct interest to the States. It would, no doubt, be possible so to arrange business in the Legislature that Bills or Budget demands of this character should be dealt with either exclusively or in the Committee stage by a Committee (analogous to the Scottish Committee of the House of Commons) consisting of the British Indian representatives alone. Some mem-bers of the sub-Committee think, however, that it would be unfor-unfortunate to initiate such a system of differentiation, and that, whatever conventions might be observed, it would be undesirable in terms to deprive the Legislature of the contribution which any of its members might be able to make on any matter within the Legislature^ purview ; and they think that it would be found in practice difficult, if not impossible, to classify a given matter as being one in which the States have no interest or concern, direct or indirect. The sub-Committee recommend, however, that the matter be further explored.37. Competence of the Federal Legislature. With reference to paragraph 5 of this Report, the reports of two sub-Committees are appended to this Report in which recommendations have been made as to the classification as federal, central or provincial, of all the subjects which are at present within the competence of the Indian Legislature. The sub-Committee endorse generally these recommendations, though they recognise that the further expert examination which the matter will undoubtedly require may show the necessity of some modification and adjustment. It will be observed that, apart from the specific recommendations made with regard to the treatment of the several items in the list, there is a general recommendation that legislative co-ordination required in respect of certain provincial subjects, or aspects of provincial subjects, should no longer be secured by the process of submitting Provincial Bills on these subjects for the previous sanction of the Governor-General, but firstly by scheduling certain existing Acts
onew 27(and the same process would, of course, be applied to certain Acts of the Federal Legislature in the future) as being incapable of amendment in their application to a Province by the Provincial Legislature without the previous sanction of the Governor-General and, secondly, by granting concurrent powers of legislation to the Federal Legislature on certain aspects of specified provincial subjects. It would be necessary to include a provision that any Provincial Act relating to these subjects which is repugnant to a Federal Act is, to the extent of the repugnancy, to be void.38. Residual powers. The sub-Committee draw attention to the fact that, however carefully the lists of Federal, Central and Provincial subjects are drawn up, there is bound to be a residue of subjects not included in any of them. Whether these residuary powers of legis-lation are to rest with the Federal Government or with the Provinces is a matter on which the sub-Committee have come to no conclusion. Its great importance is, however, manifest, and it will need most careful consideration at a later stage.39. Control by the Federal Government over Provincial Governments.  This topic leads naturally to the question of the powers of control to be exercised by the Federal Executive over the Provincial Executive and their nature and extent. It goes without saying that within the range of Federal subjects, the Federal Executive must have authority to ensure that Federal Acts are duly executed in the Provinces ; it also goes without saying that within States&apos; territory there can be no question of the exercise of any such authority, direct or indirect, outside the strict range of Federal subjects. But it seems equally evident that in matters affecting more than one Province of British India, even where they relate to subjects classified as Provincial, there must be some authority capable of resolving disputes and of co-ordinating policy when uniformity of policy is in the interests of India as a whole, and the sub-Committee consider that the constitution should recognise this authority as vesting in the Federal Government and should make suitable provision for its exercise.Signed on behalf of the sub-Committee, SANKEY,Chairman.St. James&apos;s Palace,London. 13th January, 1931.
CLASSIFICATION OF CENTRAL AND PROVINCIAL SUBJECTS.Rbpout of Joint Committee of sub-Committees Nos. I and II.The Joint C&apos;ommittee* of the Federal Structure sub-Committee and the Provincial Constitutional sub-Committee was apppointcd to consider in detail the lists of subjects circulated as R.T.C. (P.

No. I.Civil Law and Criminal Law and Procedure. Eeport of the Legal sub-Committee of sub-Committee No. I.The Legal sub-Committee have considered the possibility of giving Provincial legislatures a plenary power of legislation over the whole field of civil and criminal law and giving the Central legislature power to legislate on those matters only which are necessarily the concern of the Central authority. They find, however, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to specify or even to indicate in general terms all the matters which should be reserved for the Central legislature, and that, therefore, it will be necessary to give the Central legislature a wide power of legislation. The Committee think also that it is necessary in the interest no less of the Provinces than of British India as a whole that the uniformity in civil and criminal law which now exists should be maintained. At the same time they think that the Provincial legislatures should have a wide power of legislation as regards civil and criminal law for provincial purposes. The sub-Committee think that the objects in view can best be secured by giving the Central legislature a plenary power of legislation on all matters of civil and criminal law and giving Provincial legis-Legislatures a concurrent power of legislation except as regards those matters which are necessarily the concern of the Central authority, e.g., laws relating to international obligations, laws for territories not subject to any Provincial legislature and laws affecting any power expressly reserved to the Central authority by any law for the time being in force.To preserve the uniformity which at present exists the present arrangement should be maintained under which certain important Acts cannot be repealed or altered without the previous sanction of the Governor-General. The Acts are specified in rules made under section 80a (3) of the Government of India Act but the list requires certain alterations and additions.On all other matters so far as the legislative power of a Pro-vincial legislature is concurrent with that of the Central legislature it should be capable of being exercised without any previous sanc-tion but it should be declared to be subject to legislation by the Central legislature so that in case of a conflict between Central and Provincial legislation the former would prevail. The sub-Com-mittee think that if this plan were adopted Provincial legislatures would have in the field of civil and criminal law a power of legis-lation which would be sufficient for their needs. To give effect to this plan items 16 and 30 in the Central list should remain a,s they
are, a complementary entry should be made in the Provincial list and provision should be made somewhere in the Act on the lines of section 80a (3) (7i) to secure the uniformity desired.This uniformity should extend to such matters as those covered by the Acts referred to in the rules made under section 80a (3) (h). The list of the Acts contained in the rules will require further examination and must in any case be brought up to date.31st December, 1930.N.B. The sub-Committee consisted of the following mem-bers : Sir Muhammad Shafi, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, Mr. Jayakar, and Mr. Jinnah, with the assist-ance of Sir Edward Charmer and Sir Maurice Gwyer.
$141Sub-Committee No. II (Provincial Constitution).Report presented at Third Meeting of the Committee of the whole conference, held on 16th december, 1930.1. The following report, subject to adjustment to the complete constitution, is submitted by sub-Committee No. II.2. The sub-Committee was appointed to consider two heads of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s list, namely(a) The powers of the provincial legislatures. (6) The constitution, character, powers, and responsibilities of the provincial executives.3. The sub-Committee met on the 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th and 15th December. The proceedings on the first and second days corn-prised a general discussion of the problem. On the succeeding days particular issues were separately considered and examined. The Chairman ruled that the size, lifetime, number of chambers of the provincial legislatures, and the question of the official bloc might also be discussed as germane to the sub-Committee&apos;s Terms of Reference.4. The Abolition of Dyarchy. The sub-Committee is agreed that in the Governor&apos;s provinces the existing system of dyarchy should be abolished and that all provincial subjects, including the portfolio of law and order, should be administered in responsibility to the provincial legislatures.   (See note at end.)5. The Composition of the Provincial Executives. (a) Joint Responsibility. The sub-Committee recommends that there should be unitary executives; and that the individual Ministers composing the executive should be jointly responsible to the legislature.(Raja Narendra Nath awaits the report of the Minorities sub-Committee before agreeing finally to joint responsibility.)(b) The appointment of Ministers. The responsibility for appointing Ministers will rest with the Governor. The sub-Com-mittee is of opinion that in the discharge of that function the Governor should ordinarily summon the member possessing the largest following in the legislature, and invite him to select the Ministers and submit their names for approval. The Ministers should ordinarily be drawn from among the elected members of the provincial legislature. In the event of the appointment of a non-elected non-official, such person should be required by statute to secure election to the legislature (and if the legislature be bicameral, to either chamber) within a prescribed period not exceeding six  months,  but  subject to  this  limit he may be
!nominated by the Governor to be a member of the legislature. The sub-Committee is of opinion that there should be no dis-cretion to permit the appointment of an official to the Cabinet.(The Marquess of Zetland and Sir Robert Hamilton dissent from the last two sentences.) (c) Group or communal representation in the Cabinet. The sub-Committee considers it a matter of practical importance to the success of the new constitutions that important minority interests should be adequately recognised in the formation of the provincial executives. An obligation to endeavour to secure such repre-sentation should be expressed in the Instrument of Instructions to the Governor.(Mr. Ghintamani dissents from the last sentence.)6. Powers of the Governor. (a) In regard to legislature.  (1) The Governor shall have power to dissolve the legislature; he may assent or withhold assent to legislation; he may return a bill for reconsideration by the legislature, or reserve it for the con-sideration of the Governor-General.(2) It shall not be lawful without the previous sanction of the Governor to introduce any legislation(i) affecting the religion or religious rites of any class or community in the Province ;(ii) regulating any subject declared under the constitution to be a federal or central subject;(iii) any measure repealing or affecting any Act of the federal or central legislature or Ordinance made by the Governor-General.(b) Conduct of business. (1) The Governor shall, with the knowledge of his Ministers, be placed in possession of such infor-mation as may be needed by him for the discharge of duties imposed upon him by the constitution.(2) In the opinion of the sub-Committee, the Chief Minister should preside over meetings of the Cabinet; but on any special occasion, the Governor may preside.(c) Relations of the Governor to his Ministers. -(1) The Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor.(2) Sub-section 3 of section 52 of the Government of India Act, which confers a general power on the Governor to refuse to be guided by the advice of his Ministers when he sees sufficient cause to dissent from their opinion shall no longer operate. The Governors power to direct that action should be taken otherwise than in accordance with the advice of the Ministers, shall be restricted to the discharge of the specified duties imposed on him
by the constitution. These duties shall include the protection of minorities and the safeguarding of the safety and tranquillity of the Province.(d) Special and Emergency powers. There shall be vested in the Governor (1) suitable powers in regard to legislation and finance necessary for the discharge of the specified duties imposed upon him by the constitution and (2) suitable emergency powers to carry on the administration in the event of a breakdown of government or the constitution. The powers under (2) shall not remain in operation for more than six months without the approval of Parliament expressed by a resolution of both Houses.The sub-Committee suggests a rider that in their opinion it is desirable that the present rigid convention in Provinces other than the Presidencies of appointing Governors drawn from the Indian Civil Service should be relaxed. (There was some support for the substitution of the word &quot; discontinued &quot; for the word &quot; relaxed.&quot;)(Sir Chimanlal Setalvad, Sir Co-wasji Jehangir and Messrs. Ramachandra Rao, Barooah, Ghintamani, Joshi, Paul and Ambedkar dissent from the sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions on the powers of the Governor.)7. The Composition of the Provincial Legislatures. (a) Their size. The sub-Committee anticipates that, to meet the conditions of the new constitutions and electorates, the provincial legislatures will require to be enlarged on the basis of ascertained needs, regard being had to the numbers and character of the constituencies.(b) Their lifetime. In the opinion of the sub-Committee the normal lifetime of the provincial legislatures should not exceed five years.(c) The official bloc. With the possible exception of a strictly limited proportion of non-officials who may in some Provinces require to be nominated by the Governor to secure the representa-tion of groups unable to return their own members through the polls, the new provincial legislatures should consist wholly of elected members, and the official bloc should disappear.(d) Second Chambers. The existing provincial legislatures are unicameral. The sub-Committee recognises that conditions in some Provinces may make it desirable that the provincial legis-Legislatures should be bicameral ; but the decision to incorporate a second chamber in the new constitution of any Province other than Bengal, the United Provinces and Bihar and Orissa where opinion in favour of a second chamber has already been expressed should not be taken until opinion in the Province definitely favours this course.[The reference to the Provinces of Bengal, the United Pro-vinces and Bihar and Orissa was inserted at the wish of a majority of the sub-Committee.]

The sub-Committee was set up to consider the claims of minorities, other than those incidental to the subjects referred to other Committees, and was composed of the following members : Prime Minister (Chairman).Sir W.

2. The sub-Committee felt that the first task to which it should address itself was to have an authoritative statement of claims put in by the representatives of each community with proposals as to  how  their interests  should be  safeguarded.   Opinion was unanimous that, in order to secure the co-operation of all com-munities, which is essential to the successful working of responsible government in India, it was necessary that the new constitution should contain provisions designed to assure communities that their interests would not be prejudiced;   and that it was particularly desirable that some agreement should be come to between the major communities in order to facilitate the consideration of the whole question.   Although this was very nearly accomplished, it has not yet succeeded, but the negotiations are to be continued both here and in India.3. One of the chief proposals brought before the sub-Committee was the inclusion in the constitution of a declaration of funda-mental rights safeguarding the cultural and religious life of the various communities and securing to every individual, without discrimination as to race, caste, creed or sex, the free exercise of economic, social and civil rights. (Mr. Joshi objected to the omission of reference to the economic rights of the various com-munities. Dr. Ambedkar called attention to the necessity of including in the constitution sanctions for the enforcement of the fundamental rights, including a right of redress when they are. violated.)4. The possibility was expressed that under certain conditions the election of the Legislatures might be from a general register, but no agreement was come to regarding these conditions.Whilst it was generally admitted that a system of joint free electorates was in the abstract the most consistent with democratic principles as generally understood, and would be acceptable to the Depressed Classes after a short transitional period provided the franchise was based on adult suffrage, the opinion was expressed that, in view of the distribution of the communities in India and of their unequal economic, social and political effectiveness, there was a real danger that under such a system the representation secured by minorities would be totally inadequate, and that this system would therefore give no communal security.5. Claims were therefore advanced by various communities that arrangements should be made for communal representation and for fixed proportions of seats. It was also urged that the number of seats reserved for a minority community should in no case be less than its proportion in the population. The methods by which this could be secured were mainly three: (1) nomination, (2) joint electorates with reservation of seats, and (3) separate electorates.
6. Nomination was unanimously deprecated.7. Joint electorates were proposed, with the proviso that a proportion of seats should be reserved to the communities. Thus a more democratic form would be given to the elections, whilst the purpose of the separate electorate system would be secured. Doubts were expressed that, whilst such a system of election might secure the representation of minorities, it provided no guarantee that the representation would be genuine, but that it might, in its working, mean the nomination or, in any event, the election of minority representatives by the majority communities.It was pointed out that this was in fact only a form of community representation and had in practice all the objections to the more direct form of community electorates.8. The discussion made it evident that the demand which remained as the only one which would be generally acceptable was separate electorates. The general objection to this scheme has been subject to much previous discussion in India. It involves what is a very difficult problem for solution, viz., what should be the amount of communal representation in the various Provinces and in the Centre ; that, if the whole, or practically the whole, of the seats in a Legislature are to be assigned to communities, there will be no room for the growth of independent political opinion or of true political parties, and this problem received a serious complication by the demand of the representative of the Depressed Classes that they should be deducted from the Hindu population and be regarded, for electoral purposes, as a separate community.9. It was suggested that, in order to meet the most obvious objection te the earmarking of seats to communities, only a propor-tion should be so assigned- -say 80 per cent, or 90 per cent. and that the rest should be filled by open election. This, however, was not regarded by some of the communities as giving them the guarantees they required.10. The scheme proposed by Maulana Muhammad Ali, a member of the sub-Committee, whose death we deplore, that, as far as possible, no communal candidate should be elected unless he secured at least 40 per cent, of the votes of his own community and at least 5 or 10 per cent., according to arrangement, of the votes of the other community, was also considered. It was, however, pointed out that such a scheme necessarily involved the maintenance of communal registers, and so was open to objections similar to those urged against separate electorates.11. No claim for separate electorates or for the reservation of seats in joint electorates was made on behalf of women who should continue to be eligible for election on the same footing as men.
But, in order to familiarise the public mind with the idea of women taking an active part in political life and to secure their interim representation on the Legislature, it was urged that 5 per cent, of the seats in the first three Councils should be reserved for women and it was suggested that they should be filled by co-option by the elected members voting by proportional representation.12. There was general agreement with the recommendation of sub-Committee No. II (Provincial Constitution) that the representa-tion on the Provincial Executives of important minority communities was a matter of the greatest practical importance for the successful working of the new constitution, and it was also agreed that, on the same grounds, Muhammadans should be represented on the Federal Executive. On behalf of the smaller minorities a claim was put forward for their representation, either individually or collectively, on the Provincial and Federal Executives, or that, if this should be found impossible, in each Cabinet there should be a Minister specially charged with the duty of protecting minority interests.(Dr. Ambedkar and Sardar Ujjal Singh would add the words &quot; and other important minorities &quot; after the word Muhammadans in line 6.)The difficulty of working jointly responsible Executives under such a scheme as this was pointed out.13. As regards the administration, it was agreed that recruitment to both Provincial and Central Services should be entrusted to Public Service Commissions, with instructions to reconcile the claims of the various communities to fair and adequate representation in the Public Services, whilst providing for the maintenance of a proper standard of efficiency.*14. On behalf of the British commercial community it was urged that a commercial treaty should be concluded between Great Britain and India, guaranteeing to the British mercantile community trading rights in India equal to those enjoyed by Indian-born subjects of His Majesty on the basis of reciprocal rights to be guaranteed to Indians in the United Kingdom. It was agreed that the existing rights of the European community in India in regard to criminal trials should be maintained.15. The discussion in the sub-Committee has enabled the Delegates to face the difficulties involved in the schemes put up, and though no general agreement has been reached, its necessity has become more apparent than ever.16. It has also been made clear that the British Government cannot, with any chance of agreement, impose upon the communities an electoral principle which, in some feature or other, would be met
by their opposition. It was therefore plain that, failing an agree-ment, separate electorates with all their drawbacks and difficulties, would have to be retained as the basis of the electoral arrangements under the new constitution. From this the question of proportions would arise. Under these circumstances, the claims of the Depressed Glasses will have to be considered adequately.17. The sub-Committee, therefore, recommend that the Conference should register an opinion that it was desirable that an agreement upon the claims made to it should be reached, and that the negotiations should be continued between the representatives concerned, with a request that the result of their efforts should be reported to those engaged in the next stage of these negotiations.18. The Minorities and Depressed Classes were definite in their assertion that they could not consent to any self-governing constitu-tion for India unless their demands were met in a reasonable manner.Signed on behalf of the sub-Committee,J. RAMSAY MACDONALD.St. James&apos;s Palace, London. 16th January, 1931.* The Committee of the whole Conference at their meeting on 19th January, 1931, substituted the following for paragraph 14 : &quot;At the instance of the British commercial community the principle was generally agreed that there should be no discrimina-tion between the rights of the British mercantile community, firms and ^companies, trading in India and the rights of Indian-born subjects, and that an appropriate convention based on reciprocity should be entered into for the purpose of regulating these rights.It was agreed that the existing rights of the European community in India in regard to criminal trials should be maintained.&quot;
Sub-Committee No. IV.  (Burma.)Report presented at 3rd Meeting of the Committee of the whole Conference, on 16th January, 1931.On December 1st the Committee of the whole Conference set up a sub-Committee with the following terms of reference : &quot; To consider the nature of the conditions which would enable Burma to be separated from British India on equitable . terms, and to recommend the best way of securing this end.&quot;The following Delegates were selected to serve on this sub-Committee, over which I was appointed Chairman : Lord Peel. Mr. Srinivasan.Mr. Root. Captain Raja Sher MuhammadMr. Aung Thin. Khan.Mr. Ba Pe. Mr. Mody.Mr. Ohn G-hine. Mr. Ghuznavi.Mr. de Glanville. Sir B. N. Mitra,Mr. Chintamani. Sir Hubert Carr.Mr. Shiva Rao was subsequently selected to take the place of Mr. Chintamani.The sub-Committee met on the 5th, 8th, and 9th December, 1930, and have authorised me to present this Report. The follow -ing conclusions were reached : (1) The sub-Committee ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a public announcement that the principle of separation is accepted; and that the prospects of constitutional advance towards responsible government held out to Burma as part of British India will not be prejudiced by separation.[Mr. Mody and Mr. Shiva Rao desire it to be recorded that they cannot endorse this recommendation without qualification.](2) The sub-Committee are of opinion that the legitimate interests of Indian and other minorities must be safeguarded. They are not in a position to advise as to the particular form of protection these interests require. They consider that when the details of the constitution of Burma are being discussed, the fullest oppor-tunity should be given to all minorities and to the Government of India to represent their views and to state the nature and extent of the safeguards they consider necessary. The sub-Committee consider that adequate attention should be paid to the question of immigration of Indian Labour and that provision should be made for the regulation of the conditions of both the work and life of the immigrants. The sub-Committee also especially stress the import-ance of there being no discrimination as regards Indians entering Burma.
(3) There must be a financial settlement between India and Burma.The questions are very difficult and technical, and the sub-Com-mittee consider that they should be dealt with in the manner recommended by the Government of India in paragraph 93* of then- Despatch (Cmd. 3700).The sub-Committee also recommend that when the case has been thoroughly explored by the experts of the two Governments, the statements prepared by these experts should be laid before the Standing Finance Committees of the Indian Legislative Assembly and the Burma Legislative Council respectively, and that represen-tatives of these Committees should be associated with the experts in the proceedings of the Arbitral Board.The sub-Committee also endorse the view expressed by the Gov-ernment of India in paragraph 86 of their Despatch t regarding &apos;&apos; the great desirability . . . of adjusting the relations between the two countries in a spirit of reason and mutual accommodation so as to avoid as far as possible the ill effects which might arise from so great a change in long established practice.&quot; They venture to express the hope that all negotiations between the two Govern -ments, whether in relation to the financial adjustment or to other matters, will be approached in this spirit.(4): The sub-Committee recognise that adequate arrangements must be made for the defence of Burma after separation, but they consider that the precise nature of these arrangements must be decided in the light of expert military opinion.(5) The sub-Committee note the fact that arrangements for the taking over of the administration of subjects now classed as Central in the Devolution Rules must be made by the Government of Burma. The sub-Committee recommend that it should be considered whether, subject to the consent of the Government of India and on terms to be arranged, the Government of Burma should con-tinue to make use of certain scientific Services of the Government of India.(6) The sub-Committee express the hope that it may be found possible to conclude a favourable Trade Convention between India and Burma. They believe that a Trade Convention would benefit both countries, and they think it important that separation should cause a minimum disturbance of the close trade connections that exist between the two countries.(Signed)Russell, Chairman.St. James&apos;s Palace,London.9th December, 1930.* Annex.t Cmd. 3700.
ANNEX.Extract feom paragraph 93 op the Despatch op the Government opIndia (Cmd. 3700).&quot;It Is clear that the separation of the finances of the country will raise extremely ctifficult issues, requiring close expert analysis, in the decision of which it will be essential to hold an even balance between what may be conflicting claims. We agree with the local Government that the best method of approaching this difficult problem is to endeavour, by mutual co-operation between the Government of India and the Government of Burma, to draw up an agreed statement of the case for reference to an impartial tribunal. The subjects requiring settlement will be of a technical nature, and will include, besides the normal questions of the adjustment of revenue and expenditure, such matters as the allocation of debt charges and the adjustment of currency arrangements. No con-stitutional commission could deal satisfactorily with these questions, for its functions would be entirely different, as also its probable methods of enquiry. In arriving at a financial settlement the main point to be con-sidered is the need for satisfying public opinion in both countries that each is being fairly treated. Indian public opinion would watch this aspect of the arrangements very jealously, more particularly the allocation oi debt burdens. We believe that a committee of the Privy Council would be the sort of tribunal most likely to satisfy Indian opinion. Their deci-sions could be given on evidence placed before them, assisted by expert witnesses, or possibly assessors, from India and from Burma.&quot;
Sub-Committee No. V.   (North West Frontier Province.)Report presented at the Meeting of the Committee of the whole Conference, held on 16th January, 1931.1. Sub-Committee No. V submits the following report subject to adjustment to the complete constitution.2. The terms of reference to the sub-Committee were to consider &quot; what modifications, if any, are to be made in the general provincial constitution to suit the special circumstances of the North West Frontier Province.&quot;3. The sub-Committee comprised the following members :-  Mr. A. Henderson Sir B. N. Mitra.It held meetings on the 18th and 30th December, 1930, and on the 1st January, 1931.4. The Need for Reform. The sub-Committee is unanimous in attaching urgent importance to the need for reform in the North West Frontier Province. It recommends that the five administered districts should cease to be as they are at present a centrally adminis-tered territory under the direct control of the Government of India, and that they should be given the status of a Governors province, subject to such adjustment of detail as local circumstances require, and the extent of the All-India interests in the province necessitate.5. The Classification of Provincial Subjects. The sub-Committee recommends that, as in other Governors&apos; provinces, there should be a classification of provincial subjects entrusted to the charge of the provincial government. The precise discrimination of subjects between the Centre and the North West Frontier Province will require careful investigation, if necessary, by a specially constituted committee following broadly the lines of the classification in other provinces. Subject to the findings of such a committee the sub-Committee contemplates that the charge of the ordinary civil police(Chairman).Raja Narendra Nath. Mr. H. P. Mody. Sir A. P. Patro. Nawab Sir Abdul QaiyumLord Russell. Lord Reading. Lord Lothian. Lord Zetland. Sir Samuel Hoare. Maulana Muhammad Ali. Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto. Captain Raja SherKhan. Mr. C. E. Wood.

in the five administered districts excluding the frontier constabulary will pass to the provincial government of. these districts, but in view in particular of the close relation of the province with matters of defence and foreign policy the sub-Committee considers it essential that all matters of All-India importance and all matters connected with the control of the tribal tracts, for instance, the frontier constabulary, frontier remissions and allowances, and strategic roads should be excluded from the purview of the provincial govern-ment and classed as central subjects. The broad point is that in making the dividing line between central and provincial subjects, regard would be had to the need for classifying as central certain subjects of All-India importance peculiar to the present administra-tion of the North West Frontier Province, which could not properly be entrusted to the provincial legislature.6. The Executive. The sub-Committee recommends that the Executive should consist of the Governor assisted by the advice of two ministers drawn from the non-official members of the legislature, at least one of whom shall be elected.The Governor should also function as Agent to the Governor-General for the control of the tribal tracts, and the administration of central subjects peculiar to the North West Frontier Province. With these subjects, since they will be not provincial but central subjects, the ministers will have no concern. The sub-Committee considers it essential owing to the close inter-relation between the trans-border tracts and the settled districts and in order that All-India interests may be adequately secured that in addition to possessing all the powers vested in the Governor of a Governors province, the Governor of the North West Frontier Province should be the effective head of the Provincial administration and should preside over the meetings of his own cabinet.Note I. Sir Samuel Hoare holds the view that in accordance with the recommendation of the Chief Commissioner of the North West Frontier Province, and the Despatch of the Government of India, one of the ministers should be an official.Note II. Sir B. N. Mitra suggested the words &quot; acting on the advice of two ministers &quot; in place of the words &quot; assisted by the advice of two ministers &quot; in the first sentence of the paragraph.7. The Legislature.- (i) A unicameral legislative Council. The sub-Committee recommends that there should be set up for the five administered districts a single-chamber legislative Council with power to pass legislation and vote supply in regard to all subjects that may be classed as provincial. In addition the legislature should possess the usual powers of deliberation and of interpellation.
(ii) Its size. The size of the legislature should be suited to the convenience of the constituencies. The sub-Committee contem-plates a legislative Council with a probable total membership, elected and nominated, of not more than 40 members.(iii) Its composition. The sub-Committee considers that the legislature should for the present be composed both of elected and of nominated elements. The nominated members shall not exceed 14 members in a house of 40 ; and of the nominated members not more than six to eight should be officials.(iv) The franchise. The sub-Committee suggests that the franchise in the North West Frontier Province should be examined by the Franchise Committee to be set up to report on the franchise in all provinces.(v) Minority representation. Subject to such recommendations as the Minorities sub-Committee may make, this sub-Committee considers that if Muslims are given weightage in provinces where they are in a minority, the Hindus and Sikhs in the North West Frontier Province should be given weightage in the legislature of that province. Their representation might be three times the figure to which they would be entitled on a population basis.8. The Financial Settlement. The sub-Committee is satisfied from figures placed before it that on subjects which may be expected to be classed as provincial, the province will show a large financial deficit. It follows that the provincial government will require financial assistance from central (or federal) revenues. The Committee suggests that there should be preliminary expert investi-gation into the allocation of expenditure between central and provincial heads to supply the basis from which the financial subvention from central (or federal) revenues may be calculated. The sub-Committee apprehends that if the subvention be open to debate annually in the central (or federal) legislature, the substance of provincial autonomy in the North West Frontier Province may be impaired. It suggests that the difficulty might be met by an agreed convention that each financial assignment should run undisturbed for a period of years.(Signed)      Arthur Henderson,Chairman.St. James&apos;s Palace, London.1st January, 1931.

In our discussion of the franchise principles we have found that they were closely connected with questions which more properly concern the composition of the legislature, the nature of the constituencies, and the qualifications for candidates for election. These points have not been considered in the sub-Committee as they fall outside its terms of reference but we are of opinion that they should be further examined since the efficacy of any franchise system depends as much on these points as on the qualifications for the franchise.Sir P.

4. Extension of the franchise. While it was generally . held that adult suffrage was the goal which should ultimately be attained, it was agreed that the basis of the franchise could forthwith be broadened and that a large increase was desirable.Some difference of opinion existed as to the extent to which this was practicable in present circumstances, and it was realised that the sub-Committee had not the necessary material to determine the precise limits of the advance. The Statutory Commission sug-gested such an increase in the number of electors as would bring that number up to 10 per cent, of the total population. Some of our members thought that an increase to 25 per cent, of the total population was immediately practicable.We recommend that an expert Franchise Commission should be appointed with instructions to provide for the immediate increase of the electorate so as to enfranchise not less than 10 per cent, of the total population and indeed a larger number but not more than 25 per cent, of the total population if that should, on a full investigation, be found practicable and desirable.We recommend that, in addition to providing for this increase, the Commission should consider the introduction of a scheme by which all adults not entitled to a direct vote would be grouped together in primary groups of about 20 or in some other suitable manner, for the election of one representative member from each group, who would be entitled to vote in the Provincial elections either in the same constituencies as the directly qualified voters or in separate constituencies to be formed for them.[Mr. Joshi, Mr. Shiva Rao, Dr. Ambedkar, Mr. Srinivasan, Mr. K. T. Paul, and Mr. Jadhav regard these proposals as quite inadequate and consider that the immediate introduction of adult suffrage is both practicable and desirable.Sir Cowasji Jehangir and Sir P. C. Mitter dissent from these proposals and consider that the basis of the franchise should be broadened, if at all, by another system.]5. Uniformity of qualifications for the franchise. We recom-mend that in any given area the franchise qualifications should be the same for all communities ; but we desire that the Franchise Commission in making their proposals should bear in mind that the ideal system would as nearly as possible give each community a voting strength proportional to its numbers and that the Corn-mission should so contrive their franchise system as to secure this result in so far as it may be practicable.[Sardar Ujjal Singh, Sardar Sampuran Singh, Sir Cowasji Jehangir, and Lieut.-Colonel Gidney dissent from the latter part of this conclusion.]
6. Property qualification. We. consider that there should be a property qualification for the franchise and that in this connec-tion the word &quot; property &quot; should be understood in its widest sense as including not only the ownership of landed property but also the occupation of landed or house property or the receipt of income or wages whether in cash or kind.7. Educational qualification. We are of opinion that the h ranchise Commission should consider the possibility of framing a suitable educational qualification as an additional qualification for the franchise, bearing in rrund the ideal enunciated at the end of paragraph 5.8. Military service qualification. We are agreed that the existing Military Service qualification should be retained and we recom-mend that the Franchise Commission should consider the extension of this qualification so as to include service in the Auxiliary and Territorial Forces.9. Special franchise qualification for women.- We observe that under the existing franchise the number of women voters is in-finitesimal as compared with that of men. No system of franchise can be considered as satisfactory, or as likely to lead to good government where such a great disparity exists between the voting strength of the two sexes. We do not anticipate that the recom-mendations we have already made will reduce this disparity, nor do we think that they provide sufficiently for the enfranchisement of women. We therefore agree that special qualifications should be prescribed for women but we feel that there is not sufficient material before us to justify an attempt to formulate these special qualifications. We therefore recommend that the Franchise Com-mission should devote special attention to this question in the light of all the evidence available including the recommendations of the Statutory Commission and the suggestion made in this sub-Com-mittee that the age limit mentioned in the proposals of the Statutory Commission should be lowered from 25 to 21.[Mr. Joshi, Mr. Shiva Rao, Dr. Ambedkar, and Mr. Srinivasan dissent from the proposals in paragraphs 7, 8, and 9.]10. The franchise for special constituencies. We are of opinion that the franchise qualifications for special constituencies depend essentially on the nature of those constituencies. We are not empowered to consider the latter point nor are we in possession of information as to what special constituencies are contemplated. These questions require examination by a competent body. So far as the franchise aspect has been discussed in this sub-Committee a division of opinion has shown itself as to the desirabihty of permitting a voter qualified in both a general and a special consti-tuency to vote in both.
11. Urban and rural enfranchisement. We are of opinion that the Franchise Commission should endeavour so to adjust the franchise qualifications as to remove in those areas where it may exist any marked disparity in the operation of the franchise qualifications in urban as compared with rural areas.12. The residential requirement. We are of opinion that the residential qualification for the vote required by the electoral rules of certain Provinces should be abolished.13. The future electorate. We consider it inadvisable to lay down any programme of automatic extensions o^: the franchise. We prefer that it should be left to each Provincial Legislature to extend its franchise at its discretion after the lapse of 10 years from the date of the introduction of the new Constitutions.[Mr. Joshi, Mr. Shiva Rao, Dr. Ambedkar, and Mr. Srinivasan consider that a programme of automatic extension of the franchise should be laid down.]14. Franchise for the Central or Federal Legislature. The form of the Central or Federal Legislature has not yet been decided and in these circumstances we do not find it possible to make any suggestions regarding a suitable franchise system.[Mr. Fazl-ul-Huq and Mr. Ghuznavi desire it to be recorded that their assent to this report is contingent on the retention of separate electorates.](Sd.)

2. The sub-Committee met on the 7th, 9th, 12th, and 14th January, 1931, and have authorised me to present this report.3. The discussion in the sub-Committee centred mainly round the question of Indianisation, and every aspect of this question received thorough attention. It was unanimously agreed that in a matter of such importance as Defence, the utmost care was necessary in expressing opinions, and the sub-Committee as a whole was very-anxious not to create the impression that anyone in any way or to any degree wanted to say anything that could even remotely tend to imperil the safety of the country or to weaken the strength of the Army. It was in view of this general feeling that all sections of the sub-Committee emphasized the importance of maintaining the same standard of efficiency in training as prevails now in England. The sub-Committee also recognised that in dealing with the question of Defence it was not possible to overlook that a factor that must govern all considerations of the subject was the responsibility of the Crown through the Committee of Imperial Defence, which body was ultimately responsible for examining all these problems. It was realised that the responsibility of the Committee of Imperial Defence was not something that was special to India, but was common to the Empire as a whole.Subject to the above matters of agreement, the general discussion regarding Indianisation was on the following lines. The majority of the sub-Committee considered it impossible for practical reasons to lay down any definite rate of Indianisation or anything of a precise character that might in any way embarrass those responsible for Defence and fetter the judgment or the discretion of the military authorities. Those that held this view felt that the principle of the Indianisation of officers of the Indian Army could not be looked upon as merely a question regarding the efficiency of a single officer or group of officers, or even of a single unit or group of units. It was a principle that to the majority appeared to affect the Army as a whole. It was in consequence the view of this large section of the sub-Committee that a highly technical question was involved on which the sub-Committee was not qualified to express an opinion. One section of the sub-Committee, however, was in favour of a strong affirmation to the effect that the complete Indianisation of the officers in the Indian Army should take place within a specified period, subject of course to the requirements of efficiency, and further subjectto the provision of suitable candidates for recruitment as officers in India. Those members who were of this opinion held the view that this was not a technical question at all, but involved only practical considerations. The difference in these two views being fundamental, the sub-Committee decided to incorporate these in its. report, and the Chairman further undertook that, when, in pursuance of the resolutions of this sub-Committee, expert committees were appointed, those expert committees would as a matter of course
take into consideration the proceedings of previous Committees and in particular the proceedings of the Military Requirements Committee of. 1921 and the Committee on the. Indianisation of the Indian Army of 1922.4. Subject to the above the sub-Committee arrived at the following definite resolutions: (1) The sub-Committee consider that with the development of the new political structure in India, the Defence of India must to an increasing extent be the concern of the Indian people, and not of the British Government alone.(2) In order to give practical effect to this principle, they recommend (a) That immediate steps be taken to increase substantially the rate of Indianisation in the Indian Army to make it commensurate with the main object in view, having regard to all relevant considerations, such as the maintenance of the requisite standard of efficiency. (Mr. Jinnah dissented and desired a clear indication of the pace of Indianisation.)(6) That in order to give effect to (a), a- training college in India be established at the earliest possible moment, in order to train candidates for commissions in all arms of the Indian defence services. This college would also train prospective officers of the Indian State Forces. Indian cadets should, however, continue to be eligible for admission as at present to Sandhurst, Woolwich,, and Cranwell.(c) That in order to avoid delay the Government of India be instructed to set up a Committee of Experts, both British and Indian (including representatives of Indian States) to work out the details of the establishment of such a college.(3) The Committee also recognise the great importance attached by Indian thought to the reduction of the number of British troops in India to the lowest possible figure and consider that the question should form the subject of early expert investigation.5. A view was expressed that an addition should be made to these resolutions to the effect that the sub-Committee recognised that no action should be taken so as to prejudice in any way the power of the Crown to fulfil military obligations arising out of treaties with particular Indian States. It was ruled, however, and accepted by the sub-Committee that such a specific declaration was unnecessary ; the Chairman giving an undertaking that neither this sub-Committee nor any other Committee could in any way abrogate treaty obligations and engagements that were in operation.
6. In agreeing to the foregoing recommendations the Committee were unanimous in their view that the declaration must not be taken as a mere pious expression of opinion, but that immediately the Conference was concluded, steps should be taken to deal effectively with the recommendations made,7. The advisability of establishing a Military Council including representatives of the Indian States was agreed to.Signed on behalf of the sub-Committee,J. H.

Sub-Committee No. Vm (Services).Report presented at the Meeting of the Committee of the whole Conference, held on 16th January, 1931.The terms of reference to this sub-Committee were as follows :  &quot; The Relation of the Services to the new political structure.&quot;The following Delegates were selected to serve on the sub-Committee .:-r-&apos;.&quot; .Sir William Jowitt (Chairman).Lord Zetland.Major Stanley.Lord Reading.Sir Robert Hamilton.H.H.

Mr. Ghuznavi.Khan Bahadur Hafiz Hidayat Husain.Mr. Zafrullah Khan.Dr. shafa&apos;at &apos;at Ahmad Khan.Mr. Fazl-ul-Huq.Sir Edgar Wood.The sub-Committee met on the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 12th, and 13th of January, 1931, and have authorised me to present this Report.
1. Existing members of the Services. Inasmuch as the Govern-ment of India Act and the rules made thereunder by the Secretary of State in Council guarantee certain rights and safeguards to members of the Services, due provision should be made in the new constitution for the maintenance of those rights and safeguards for all persons who have been appointed before the new constitution comes into force.When the new constitution is drawn up suitable safeguards for the payment of pensions (including family pensions) and provident funds, should be provided.As it is important that those responsible for the working of the new constitution should not at its initiation be embarrassed by the economic waste and administrative difficulties which a change of staff on a large scale would entail, it is desirable to take such steps as are necessary to reassure existing members of the Services with the view that they may serve with loyalty and efficiency for their normal term.To this end the sub-Committee agreed that the right to retire on proportionate pension should be extended, but opinion was divided as to whether the extension should be for an unlimited term or for a definite period of years, not exceeding five years.2. Future recruitment for the All-India Services. We recommend that for the Indian Civil and Indian Police Services recruitment should continue to be carried out on an All-India basis, but the majority of the Committee are of opinion that recruitment for Judicial Offices should no longer be made in the Indian Civil Service. The Indian Forest Service and the Irrigation Branch of the Indian Service of Engineers should be provincialised.(Four members would prefer that the Irrigation Branch should remain an All-India Service.Mr. Shiva Rao and Mr. Tambe desire to record their view that all Services should be provincialised forthwith.Dr. Ambedkar, Mr. Zafrullah Khan, and Sardar Sampuran Singh are averse to further recruitment on an All-India basis for the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police Service, save in respect of the European element in those Services.)3. The recruiting and controlling authority for the future A11-India Services. Since we are recommending that the Indian Forest Service and the Irrigation Branch of the Indian Service of Engineers should no longer be recruited on an All-India basis, we do not think it necessary to offer any special observations with regard to these two Services.On the question whether we should record any recommendation as to the desirability of securing a continuance of the recruitment of a European element in the Indian Civil Service.and the Indian Police Service there was some divergence of opinion.
The majority of the sub-Committee are of opinion that in the case of these two Services it is desirable that some recruitment of Europeans should continue. On the question of the ratio there is a difference of opinion, some holding that for the present recruit-ment should continue on the lines laid down by the Lee Commission, while others would prefer that the matter should be left for decision by the future Government of India.Whatever decision may be reached as to ratio, the majority of the sub-Committee hold that the recruiting and controlling authority in the future should be the Government of India. They would leave to that authority the decision of all questions such as conditions of recruitment, service, emoluments and control. Those who take this view attach importance to complete control over the Services being vested in the Central and Provincial Governments. A minority of the sub-Committee think that the recruiting authority should be the Secretary of State, since they hold that without an ultimate right of appeal to him, and through him to the British Parliament, it will not be possible to secure recruits of the required type for the British element in the Services. Those who take this view consider that adequate control over the members of the Services can be secured to the Indian and Provincial Governments under the Devolution Rules.There is one further observation we have to make under this head. In existing circumstances the Government of India can and does obtain officers from the Provinces to fill certain central appoint-ments. Under the new regime we hope that it will be found possible to conclude arrangements between the Government of India and the Provincial Governments so as to secure the continuance of this practice which has obvious advantages.4. The Indian Medical Service. -Subject to paragraph 1, the sub-Committee are of opinion that in future there should be no civil branch of the Indian Medical Service ; and that no civil appointments either under the Government of India or the Provincial Governments should in future be listed as being reserved for Europeans as such.The Civil Medical Services should be recruited through the Public Service Commissions. In order to provide a war reserve, a clause should be inserted in the contracts of service of a sufficient number of officers that they shall undergo such military training and render such military service as they may be called upon to do. The extra cost involved should be borne as an Armv charge.Further, the Governments and Public Service Commissions in India should bear in mind the requirements of the Army and the British officials in India and take steps to recruit a fair and adequate number of European doctors to their respective Civil Medical Services, and should be prepared to pay such salaries as would bring about this result.
It is suggested that agreement might be reached between the Central Government and the Provincial Governments whereby the latter in selecting their European doctors might grant a preference to those members of the Indian Medical Service who have performed a period of service with the Army. We contemplate that such members would sever their connection with the Indian Medical Service during the term of their employment in the Provincial Medical Service subject only to the acknowledgment of a. claim by the Army authorities in time of emergency. The practical details of any such arrangement would have to be a matter of agreement between the Army authorities and each Provincial Government.(Major Stanley wishes to make it clear that his acceptance of this section is contingent upon the possibility of securing satisfactory agreements under paragraph 4.Lord Zetland and Sir Edgar Wood fear that under the scheme proposed neither the Provincial Governments nor the Indian Medical Service will secure European Medical Officers of the type required, and they would prefer that the present arrangement should continue until Indianisation both in the Indian Army and in the Civil Services has proceeded further.)5. Public Service Commissions. (1) In every Province and in connection with the Central Government a Statutory Public Service Commission shall be appointed by the Governor or Governor-General as the case may be.(2) Recruitment to the Public Services shall be made through such Commissions in such a way as to secure a fair and adequate repre-sentation to the various communities consistently with considerations of efficiency and the possession of the necessary qualifications. This part of the duties of the Public Service Commissions shall be subject in the case of Provincial Commissions to periodical review by the Governor, and in the case of the Central Commission by the Governor-General, both of whom shall be empowered to issue any necessary instructions to secure the desired result.(Raja Narendra Nath and Sardar Sampuran Singh desire to add a proviso that the proportion of appointments to be filled to redress communal, class and caste inequalities should not in any case exceed one-third of the total, appointments to be filled, the remaining two-thirds of the appointments being filled solely on considerations of merit.)The Governor shall, before considering any appeal presented to him against any order of censure,- of withholding an increment or promotion, of reduction to a lower post, of suspension, removal or dismissal, consult the^Commission in regard to the order to be passed thereon.
(3) Members of the Public Service Commissions shall hold office during the pleasure of the Crown and be removable by the Governor, in the case of a Provincial Commission, and by the Governor-General in the case of the Central Commission. They shall, after ceasing to be members of a Commission, be ineligible for a period to be fixed by the Governor or Governor-General as the case may be for further office under the Crown in India, except that persons who have been members of a Provincial Public Service Commission shall he eligible for appointment as members of the Central Commission or of another Provincial Commission, and vice versa.(4) The sub-Committee recognise the special position of the Anglo-Indian community in respect of public employment, and recommend that special consideration should be given to their claims for employment in the Services.(5) There should be a statutory declaration that(a) No person shall be under any disability for admission into any branch of the Public Services of the country merely by reason of community, caste, creed, or race.(b) Membership of any community, caste, creed, or race shall not be a ground for promotion or supersession In any Public Services.In making this recommendation the sub-Committee have par-ticularly in mind the case of the Depressed Classes. They desire that a generous policy be adopted in the matter of the employment of the Depressed Classes in Public Service, and in particular recommend that the recruitment to all Services, including the Police, should be thrown open to them.6. Internal Administration of the Police.  Subject to the recommendation which has already been made by the &quot; Provincial Constitution&quot; sub-Committee, that under the new constitution responsibility for law and order should be vested in the Provincial Governments, the question whether in consequence any special recommendation should be made as to the internal administration of the Police was left to this sub-Committee. We have given consideration to various suggestions made under this head. Some of the sub-Committee think it undesirable to make any recom-mendation which might be held to impinge upon the discretion of the future Provincial Governments. Others, who consider that the control over the Police Forces at present secured to the Inspectors-General by statute should be preserved, advise that the Police Act of 1861 should not be subject to repeal or alteration by the Legislature without the prior consent of the Governor-General, and that the Police Acts of the Governments of Bombay, Bengal, and Madras should be included in the category of Acts which should not be repealed or altered by the Provincial Legislature without the previous sanction of the Governor-General.

As regards the Services under the control of the Governor-General, we do not feel called upon to make any recommendation.Signed on behalf of the sub-Committee.W. A.

Sub-Committee No. IX (Sind).Report presented at the Meeting of the Committee of the whole Conference, held on 16th January, 1931.1. The members of the sub-Committee were : Lord Russell (Chairman).

They consider that the racial and linguistic differences between the inhabitants of Sind and those of the Presidency of Bombay proper, the geographical isolation of Sind from Bombay, the difficulties of communication between the two, and the insistency with which separation has been advocated, provide an impressive case for the division of Sind from the Bombay Presidency and the creation of a separate Provincial Government there.3. They observe that the Government of Bombay have pointed out certain administrative difficulties in the way of the separation of Sind, but they do not believe them to be insuperable.4. They note that no detailed examination of the financial consequences of separation has yet been made. On the figures available to them they are unable to express an opinion on the financial aspects of the question.

The sub-Committee with two dissentients (Dr. Moonje and Raja Narendra Nath) are impressed by the strength of the arguments in favour of separation, and they have come to the conclusion that the principle of separation should be accepted. They therefore recommend that an expert Committee in India should examine carefully the probable revenue and expenditure of a separated Sind and the security of the debt on the Sukkur Barrage, and should also recommend an equitable adjustment of the financial commit-ments for which Sind may properly be considered liable. If the investigation shows that separation would leave the new Province with a deficit, the sub-Committee think that the representatives of Sind should be asked to show satisfactorily how the deficit would be met before the new Province is set up.Signed on behalf of the sub-Committee,RUSSELL.St. James&apos;s Palace,London, 14th January, 1931.
RESOLUTION.Adopted by Conference unarrimously at the final Plenary Session, held on 19th January, 1931.The Conference sitting in Plenary Session has received and noted the Reports of the nine sub-Committees submitted by the Committee of the whole Conference with comments thereon.These Reports, provisional though they are, together with the recorded notes attached to them, afford, in the opinion of the Conference, material of the highest value for use in the framing of a Constitution for India, embodying as they do a substantial measure of agreement on the main ground-plan, and many helpful indications of the points of detail to be further pursued. And the Conference feels that arrangements should be made to pursue without interruption-tion the work upon which it has been engaged, including the provision in the Constitution of adequate safeguards for the Mussahnans, Depressed Classes, Sikhs, and all other important minorities.SPEECH DELIVERED   BY THE PRIME MINISTERat the final Plenary Session of the Conference, held on 19th January, 1931, at St. James&apos;s Palace.Chairman : Your Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have met for the last part of this Conference. You will believe me, I am perfectly certain, when I assure you that never in the whole of my life have I presided over a gathering with more pleasure and more pride than I have presided over this. When I spoke to you at the end of the first part of our proceedings, I assured you that you had come here as our colleagues, that you would have no necessity to persuade us regarding status, because our conception of the Conference, and the conception of my Parliamentary colleagues as well, was that you had come from India to meet us, representing the Legislature of Great Britain, for the purpose of taking counsel together to achieve a common purpose, the self-government of India.I think I was right. I think you will go back to India, whether you are disappointed as to the work or not, and say &quot; We were met by our British colleagues on terms of hospitable equality ; we have put our case before them, and they have listened with a desire to accommodate us ; and they have put their case before us, and we assure you that there is so much in their case, so much experience in the working of institutions, so much in relation to the peculiar conditions of India, that they and we must come to agreements upon it.&quot;
Now, we have gone as far as we can go at this moment. You have to go back to India ; we have to go back to our own public opinion. You have spoken here subject to reconsideration, subject to the reaction which your public opinion will show to your work ; we, Government and Parliamentary representatives alike, have spoken in the same way, and we must also listen to reactions. We must also explain and expound and defend ; we must also make ourselves the champions of our findings, and do our best to bring our people along with &apos;us in our pilgrimage of hope to their conclusion.What have we been doing ? Pledge after pledge has been given to India that the British Raj was there not for perpetual domination. Why did we put facilities for education at your disposal ? Why did we put in your hands the textbooks from which we draw political inspiration, if we meant that the people of India should for ever be silent and negative subordinates to our rule ? Why have our Queens and our Kings given you pledges ? Why have our Viceroys given you pledges ?   Why has our Parliament given you pledges ?Why, when the Morley-Minto Reforms were launched, did those Reforms contain not merely machinery of government but a promise of advance ? Why, when the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms were in due course launched, did they too not only set up a system of government but give you a pledge that something else was to follow ? The Simon Commission itself was appointed, not because there was a Government in office desirous of change ; the Simon Commission was appointed because it was contained as a sacred pledge in the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. And if to-day, if during the last ten weeks, we had met you with a uniform non-possumus, we would have been untrue to the pledges given to India by the Government for which we are responsible. When the Simon Commission was appointed a Commission which let me say, because I must say it, has done a work remarkable, conspicuous, and essential you may agree with it or you may not, but you could not have come to the conclusions with us to which you have come had there been no Simon Commission and had not the Simon Commission opened doors that up to then were closed, and brought ears into action that up to then were deaf. India will never be able to be too grateful or to show too much gratitude for the labours of the men who composed the Simon Commission. When that Commission was appointed, we all agreed the leaders of the three political parties here agreed that when the British Government came to consider the Report, came to give it a legal and constitutional value, at some time or other, and somehow, a consultation would have to take place between the representatives of the British Parliament and the representatives of Indian opinion ; and that is why you are here. I regret profoundly that important sections of Indian political activity are not here too.
I am one of those who, I dare say, are regarded by you (and my colleagues too), as belonging to the Left Wing of politics. That is neither here nor there. But do believe me, Left Wing, Centre or Right, I am one of those who believe that he who stirs enmity between peoples is not going to advance liberty in the world. He who spreads suspicion, he who makes co-operation impossible, is not one of those agents for good that the world in its present distracted frame of mind is so much in need of. If anything has been done by you and us here during the last ten weeks to make the youth of India turn to practical problems, turn to the ways of conquest by calm reason, argue thus: &quot; My case is unanswerable, and I am prepared to put it to the test of reason&quot;- if anything that you and I have been able to do here will produce that result, if we do nothing else, we will have made a great contribution to the progressive political development of the Indian nation.Everyone must honestly admit that situations have arisen, like some of the communal difficulties, which have put obstacles in our way. Now, I want you to take it from me that the attitude of the British Government in such relations is nothing more than an overpowering desire to leave you to settle your own affairs. We are not pro-Hindu., we are not pro anything else. If we are animated by anything, it is by the conception of India herself India a unity, India feeling behind and below and above and beyond her communal differences that mystic bond of unity which the great poets, the great philosophers, and the great religious teachers of India have always felt. Believe me, the British Government has no desire to use your disagreements for any ulterior purpose. Quite the opposite. Our one ambition is that, being in a sense kith and kindred with you, (since history, whether you liked it or whether we liked it, has woven our destinies somehow together), we may use that unity with you in order to pave your way and smooth your path to that much-required internal unity amongst yourselves.In a few moments I will make further reference to the position of minorities, but I take great pride, and I am sure my colleagues do the same, that, as the result of this Conference and the conversations, both private and public, that have taken place at this Conference, the gap between you is much narrower than it was before, and that the very men, who, feeling that they must be loyal to their community, in sorrow were unable to agree, are inspired more by the feeling of agreement than ever. In the conversations and negotiations that are. going to take place they will be moved more by that feeling than ever they have been before.I am convinced, my friends, that you can settle. And I am also convinced of this-that an imposed agreement might make your constitution unworkable.
I would like now to make one or two observations from the point of view, first of all, of one who has had a good deal of experience in political values the value of words and the value of provisions. -I have listened to some of my minority friends making their claims. Do remember this. We sitting here are not a Legislature. We sitting here cannot impose pains and penalties. We sitting here can declare rights and hand over to you the political power to see that those rights are enforced and respected. We can put in the constitution that this disability may not be put upon you, that the next disability may not be put upon you. Believe me, after some experience in those things, ultimately it depends upon the intelligence of your people, it depends upon their organisation, it depends upon their strength of will, it depends upon the success of their leadership as to whether words become deeds and declarations actions.As regards the form of the constitution, all the speakers have said that it has been determined that it is to be a Federation. Your Highnesses, I can add nothing to the tribute that has been paid to you by previous speakers regarding the magnificent part that you have played in making that possible. Before you came the structure of the Indian constitution was in doubt. Many people, as was said this morning, were doubtful as to whether British India alone could bear central authority. You came. You made your declaration. You showed your patriotic interest in Indian affairs and your very wise vision regarding the future, and your words made it possible for us to build up a constitution and to put political weight upon it. That has been a great achievement for which both India and Great Britain are grateful to Your Highnesses. In build-ing up that constitution we have come across some very awkward things. There is a word which, when used in politics and, some of my friends here also know in economics I detest, and that is &quot; safe-guarding.&quot; That is one of my sins, I suppose. Safeguarding I do not like the word. To you especially, it is an ugly word ; it is a word which quite naturally rouses great suspicions in your hearts. It is a word the aspects and the meaning and the connotation and the associations of which are rather forbidding. Let us apply common sense to it. The safeguards that have been suggested here fall under three categories. One category is a group of reserved powers given to somebody Governor, Governor-General, the Crown or somebody else, and that category of safeguards you will find either expressed or implicit in every free constitution from the rising sun to the setting sun. That category includes powers which may be put into operation by somebody authorised, somebody in authority, somebody in a distinguished position, in a powerful position in the State, put into operation by him in the event of a breakdown of the ordinary normal operations of Government. And, my Indian colleagues, you can twist and you can turn, you can turn a blind eye to
this and a blind eye to that, you can draft with care and you can hide up what really is the substance of your draft, but if you were drafting your own constitution, without any outside assistance or consultation, you could not draft a constitution without embodying safeguards of that kind in it.Then there is the second category of safeguards, and there are two sections of that. The first covers guarantees made by the Secretary of State, or made by the British Government or the British Crown, for which we, by virtue of contracts that we have made in your behalf, remain responsible under a new constitution just as under the existing one. The typical instances of that are finance and also the existing Services. Those guarantees, in the interests of India herself, have to be made clear to the world. It is not that we want to interfere ; it is not even that we want the money ; it is that if there were any doubt at all about India shouldering those obliga-tions and responsibilities, the moral status of India would be deteriorated, and, in spite of the materialism of this age, there is far more materialist power resting on moral foundations than many of you wot of. It is to put India in a moral position in the eyes of the rest of the world that that section of reserved subject is required.Then there is another section. There are matters not solely Indian, owing mainly to India&apos;s history, and requiring some time for a change. Do not be afraid of time. I know your patience has been tried ; I know you have waited long ; but, nevertheless, when you are going fastest you have not to be too penurious of time, because that which is built, I do not say unnecessarily slowly, but that which is built calmly and steadily step by step, endures, whilst that which is built in a hurry wastes away and comes to ruin.Then there is the third category of safeguards relating to com-munities. Now I repeat what I have said to you so often regarding that : if you fail to agree to set up your own safeguards, to come to a settlement between yourselves regarding those safeguards, the Government will have to provide in the constitution provisions designed to help you; but do remember the best of all is your own, and we do not propose to lose a grip of you, we do not propose to let you go as though you have said the last word here, because we do not believe you have said the last word.Communities, small and great, must be safeguarded in the Indian constitution in the terms of the constitution, but the content of those terms, the details of those terms, a settlement that satisfies those terms my Indian friends, are you to allow them to pass away from your own hands, and ask anybody outside yourselves to do for you what you declare you are not able to do for yourselves ?There is one great danger inherent in these safeguards which I will mention, because it is of the utmost importance in the working
of the constitution. Ministers responsible must not shield them-selves from taking upon their own shoulders their responsibility when it is unpopular by leaving the Viceroy or the Governor to put into operation his reserved powers.Moreover, we have this problem in front of us too : in executives, in particular, there must be unified responsibility. I am not going to push that observation to any more pointed conclusion, but the great task in forming an Executive is not so much to give it responsibility (which is the peculiar characteristic of legislatures) but it is to secure for the Executive the confidence of the Legislature, together with its own united working in policy.Now, as regards the future, we have before us the Reports of the various sub-Committees, all of them noted, together with your observations upon them. The Government proposes at once to study these very carefully in order to face the problems which they present to it. We have, for instance, sub-Committee No. 1, the sub-Committee presided over with such conspicuous ability by the Lord ChanceUor, who, by that one act of service has won for himself a great place in your hearts. That Report, rough wood, if I may say so, wood of very varying lengths, full of knots, full of difficulties in handling and using, must be planed and fitted into a logical and consistent structure.Sub-Committee No. II has endorsed the principle of fully repre-sentative government in the Governors&apos; Provinces, subject to the retention by the Governors of certain powers which were widely agreed to be necessary at this stage.The Minorities sub-Committee I have already referred to. You have not heard the last of us regarding that. As to the sub-Committee on Burma, its findings have been noted, and the Government will pursue the decisions of that sub-Committee; separating Burma and making the necessary enquiries as to the conditions upon which the separation is to take place.With regard to the North-West Frontier Province, which was the subject of sub-Committee No. V, that sub-Committee has recom-mended the elevation of its status to that of a Governors Province, with a constitution analagous to that of other Governors&apos; Provinces under the new regime, but with the necessary modi-fications and adaptations to suit the peculiar local conditions and requirements, and with the necessary financial adjustments with the Central Government.Sub-Committee No. VI, the Franchise sub-Committee, recom-mended the setting-up of a Committee to work out specified problems, and that Committee will be set up.
Sub-Committee No. VII dealt with Defence. That will be proceeded . with, and if it is possible to put into operation, without the delay that will be required in the building up of the full constitution, some of its parts by administration, we shall get into touch with the Government of India and see how that can be done. I refer to such things, for instance, as the creation of a Military Sandhurst in India.Sub-Committee No. VIII dealt with the Services, and affirmed the necessity of continuing to existing members of the Services under the new constitution the guarantees which the present Act and the Rules framed under it give them, and has explored the position as regards the future.Sub-Committee No. IX dealt with Sind, and adopted with two dissentients the principle that Sind should be formed into a separate Province, but left its feasibility for future decision after enquiry by an expert Committee into the financial problems involved. . That also will be undertaken.I need not go through any more details than that. These pledges I give you, these statements I make, relate to administration and to the setting up merely of the Committees.One or two of you who have had large experience in administration have pressed upon us that under the existing Government of India Act some things of importance could be done by administration, to bring Indian administrative action more into accord with the declarations made here than is the case to-day. We cannot commit ourselves as to whether that is so or not, but we propose, in con-sultation with Indians of administrative experience, to explore that, and as the result of the exploration we shall take action or otherwise.At this point I may turn to the very moving appeal made by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru to me this morning regarding an amnesty. It was a wise and a moving, appeal which, I can assure the Conference, lodges very naturally in my own heart. I should like this Conference to open a new chapter in the relations of India and ourselves. If Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru&apos;s appeal to India, as well as to us is responded to in India, and civil quiet is proclaimed and assured, His Majesty&apos;s Government will certainly not be backward in responding to his plea, which is endorsed by so many of his colleagues here.Now that brings me to the question of what is to be done to complete our labours. We have agreed upon certain features of the constitution, but the successful launching of the constitution depends still upon very careful study of conditions and structure. I think it was Lord Peel who said that we were not so short-sighted and so self-centred as to be under the impression that the only successful constitutional machinery is that under which we work ourselves. As a matter of fact, if you ask my opinion, I can give you some very bad results of. its working! Therefore it is certainly not perfect. We have got the United States type ; we have a type which has
been used in Japan, and which is of very great interest, especially in some of its aspects, if not in all. We have a type such as was used in Germany before the war ; we have got French methods, and so on ; and in order that we may have all the world experience of working Legislatures elected in different ways and composed in different ways, we shall study those. We have, as a matter of fact, studied them, and we hope to get from that study ideas, suggestions, plans, from which the new Indian Constitution can be benefited and made workable. Some conditions that have been attached to the working of the Constitution have been practically agreed upon, they have become of the nature of problems that can quite easily be settled by a chairman&apos;s ruling, or by a government decision, involving no principle and creating no friction. Others still require work, especially the open questions and the notes of dissent made to the Report of Committee No. 1. There is, for instance, the place of the States in the federation ; the provision which must be made that the States in everything which they have not agreed to hand over to the federal authority have direct contact with the Crown. There is the composition of the Legislatures and Executives and some problems regarding practical working. There are the problems of communities and the various details of safeguarding. Now, I think I am right that so much work has been done upon these questions that the time has come for us to begin to try to draft something, because it is only when you begin to draft that you discover what you have overlooked and what you have not properly considered. Now, this work must not be left to the bureaucracy in either country, but must be conducted on the direct responsibility of the politician aided and guided by those admirably equipped servants of the State which both our civil services contain. I hope, for instance, that in the further negotiations and explorations we are going to have the great pleasure of continuing the parliamentary unity which has been maintained with so much good feehng during the last ten weeks in the work of this Conference.There is another important thing. One of the secrets of our success thus far in fact, I am not at all sure it is not the main secret  is the personal contacts that we have been able to establish and to keep going. I have had a good deal of experience of these Conferences. One week of a Conference produces more good than six months of diplomatic correspondence. Let us get down to facts face to face ; let us sit round the table ; let each of us state our claims, state our hopes, state our fears, state our expectations ; let each of us be candid one to another, and, face to face there is an enormously better chance of an understanding and an agreement than under any other circumstances. I wish to continue that condition. There are practical difficulties, as you know. Much work has still to be done in India of an educational and explanatory character.
At this minute, after all the heavy work we have had to undertake without remission during the whole day, and very often far into the night, you will understand me when I say that I am not in a position at this moment to tell you precisely the plan by which those negotiations are going to be continued and those personal contacts to be maintained. I mention that because I know that some of my friends place great store upon those points, and I want to assure you before you go home that I thoroughly agree with you regarding them.I propose to confer with the new Viceroy at once, who is arriving here in a few days, and tell him what has been done my colleagues and myself, and I hope in this that I may include my Parliamentary colleagues as well as my Governmental colleagues and agree to a plan which will satisfy the requirements which I have just stated.At this point I will read to you the declaration which I am authorised to make by my colleagues of the Government.The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that responsibility for the government of India should be placed upon Legislatures, Central and Provincial, with such provisions as may be necessary to guarantee, during a period of transition the observance of certain obligations and to meet other special circumstances, and also with such guarantees as are required by minorities to protect their political liberties and rights.In such statutory safeguards as may be made for meeting the needs of the transitional period, it will be a primary concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see that the reserved powers are so framed and exercised as not to prejudice the advance of India through the new constitution to full responsibility for her own government.. His Majesty&apos;s Government, whilst making this declaration, is aware that some of the conditions which are essential to the working of such a constitution as is contemplated, have not been finally settled, but it believes that as the result of the work done here, they have been brought to a point which encourages the hope that further negotiations, after this declaration, will be successful.His Majesty&apos;s Government has taken note of the fact that the deliberations of the Conference have proceeded on the basis, accepted by all parties, that the Central Government should be a Federation of all-India, embracing both the Indian States and British India in a; bi-cameral legislature. The precise form and structure of the new Federal Government must be determined after further discussion with the Princes and representatives of British India.   The range of
