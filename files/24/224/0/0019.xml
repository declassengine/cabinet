Iris document is tire property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmentecret.. p. 284 (31) *c a :b i net:.Interpretation of International Convention in regard to tine employment of women at night .Reference to Permanent Court of international Justice.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour.a question has arisen as to the interpretation of the International Convention in regard to the employment of women at night in factories said other industrial undertakings which was a-adopted in 1919 by the International Labour Conference under Part 13  of the Treaty of Peace.The Convention in terms prohibits,  subject to  certadn exceptions,  the employment of women in industrial undertakings during the night.      Ho exception is made for women in positions of supervision or management such as  is  contained in another Convention adopted, at the sane time,   i.e. the Convention of the Eight Hours Day.      It has been represented to the Home Office that the application of the Convention to women engaged in such positions is a hardship,  and cases are instanced of women who have been trained as electrical engineers,  and who are prevented from being employed in charge of any electrical station or sub-station where duty at night is entailed.The British Government brought the question before the International Labour Organisation and proposals for the amendment of the Convention in this respect were laid before the International Labour Conference this year.      The proposals obtained a majority of votes in the Conference, but not the full two-thirds which is required for the-adoption of a Convention under the Treaty of Peace.      In the course of the debate/
debate it was  contended by some of the  delegates who opposed the proposals that no amendment of the  Convention was necessary as the terms of the Convention did not apply to women holding responsible positions of supervision or management and not usually employed in manual labour;    and that the Convention was being interpreted in this sense in their own countries. Countries which have adopted this interpretation include Belgium, France,   Germany,  Italy,  India and Roumania.This divergence of opinion in regard to the construction of the Convention is a serious one and may become of some importance from the industrial point of view.      It is undesirable that the position should he left where it is, and as the British efforts to obtain a modification of the wording of the Convention have failed,  some other method of getting the point settled must be sought.Provision is made under Article 425 of the Treaty of Peace &quot;that any question or dispute relating to the interpretation of this Part (that is, Part 13)  of the&apos; present Treaty or of any subsequent Convention concluded by the Members in pursuance of the provisions of this Part of the present Treaty shall be referred for decision to the Permanent Court of International Justice&quot;.      It is proposed that advantage should be taken of this provision,  and that the British Government should take steps  to bring the point before the Court .      The point is a comparatively simple one and should not involve an?/ lengthy proceedings.If this course is approved,  the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government will be instructed to raise the question on the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation as a matter of courtesy and to ask that application may be ma.de by the Governing Body to the Council of the League.H .8 .    ,18th Hovember.  1931.
