SECRET.WAR CABIHEg,.Letter from lit.-Col, Sir John llorton, GriffithsA^M^ ^14th March, 1917.Sir,She position in Roumania up to the time of ny departure became so serious, particularly during tho last wooke of February, that tho King, General Ivorosco and General Presan sought ny a&amp;vico on many occasions in connection with tho complete and absolute chaos which, reigned.Various reports, including a copy of a letter which I deemed it &quot;my duty to give to His Majesty-s Ambassador at&quot; Pctregrad, a copy of which I handed to you on ny arrival, deal with the grave naturo of the position^&quot;At tho time of departure, it was obvious, although not declared, that&quot;tho Local Russian Authorities had virtually made up their minds, rather than make any further offcrt to overcome tho difficulties which faced thorn, to withdraw at tho first excuse to their frontier*    Tho main difficulties arc the total inefficiency and complete breakdown of Government Departments, the colLapso of the Railway Organisation, tho shortage of food and fuel, tho inability of the Roumanians to grapple with the&quot; typhus epidemic which is beginning to spread over tho country, while tho s61diers wore and are dying of starvation and want of clothing, owing to tho entire collapse of Government and Railway Organisation,   This is a grave statement &quot;to make, but it is my duty to a.sk jrou to accept it as correct.&quot;I drow the attention of Sir George Buchanan to tho position, and after an interview with &quot;General Gorku I was requestod to stay and see the Emperor,     Meanwhile, Sir George Buchanan called a Conference of Ambassador s*   The result of &quot;ny interview with tho Emperor, which lasted an hour and a half, was that he Y/ould cordially welcome any suggestions which tho British or French&apos;Governments might make.v/ith a view to dealing with tho position.-   His Majesty admitted that under tho cireum-stanoos it would bo very difficult for Russia herself to take the initiative, but ho appeared to approve of tho enclosed suggestions, and I was authorised by&quot;His Majesty to communicate the results of this interview to tho King and His Majesty1s Government.   Sir Georgo Buchanan was of course cognisant of what took place, and I think I am right in saying ho also considers., from information which has boon submitted to him from other sources as well, that drastic action is necessary from this side..There is no other solution than that of arranging for the control by the Allies of the various Government Departments in the same able way that tho French have assumed control of tho Ministry of Munitions..   Tho Government as a Government has absolutely and entirely proved itself totally inadequate to deal with the position.
TThen meeting Mr. Balfour and Lord Robert Cecil yesterday, I conveyed to them ny views on the present position in Roumania^ and. they both requested, mo to fonmi*&apos; late the points under review as discussod with the  taper or t General Gorku and Siir* George Buchanan, which I now oneloso herewith in duplicate..I hare the honour to be, Sir,Your obodient Servant,(Signed)       J, JJOHMJ (JHI^SHS.
NOTES FOR CONSIDERATION WITH REFERENCE TO ACTION IN ROUMANIA.

1. As the Allied Governments have now to find the necessary finance with which to maintain Roumania&apos;s position as an Ally, it is a reasonable suggestion for the three Great Powers to demand that a financial Controller should be appointed. Under this heading it is suggested that the Financial Controller should deal directly with the Army in connection with the money necessary for its upkeep.

2. Under the present system there is no punishment for traitors, spys or deserters, and any effort, so far, by the Roumanian Commanders to deal with this has been rendered ineffective by the action of one Minister or another of the Government. It is of paramount importance, with a view to dealing with this position, which is  a very serious one, that an Allied Court be at once instituted, composed of Roumanian, Russian, British and French Officers.

3. The whole of Roumania should at once be placed under Military Control.

4. That the majority of the civilian population should be at once evacuated into Russia, owing to the impossibility of feeding them, leaving only sufficient to carry on the essential work of the Country.

5. The new Roumanian Army new in training should also be evacuated to continue their work in convenient places in Russia. This is necessary iron a food point of view, apart from the epidemic of typhus which is now spreading, and will undoubtedly got the upper hand.

6. At least two, if not four, Divisions and the Royal Family to remain in Roumania. The Members of the Cabinet could possibly remain subject to a Controller appointed by the Allies being put into the Department of each.

7. The Railways to be placed immediately under the control of an Engineer appointed by the Allies, with full powers.

8. The procedure suggested is, that France and Great Britain should confer on those main points, and if they approve, the Ambassadors in Po?rograd should at once be cabled to take the necessary action. The Ministers themselves in Roumania would require definite and final instructions in this respect so that they could present an ultimatum to Mr. Bratiano  that while they did not wish to diminish his prestige, yet these reforms were imperative, and if he acquiesced, they would do everything in their power to uphold his position and authority. It would be necessary to point out that unless the Government immediately agreed, the Allies would be compelled to with-hold supplies other than those actually necessary for the Army in the Field.

This briefly outlines the only possible solution of the situation, and unless it is, broadly speaking, dealt with on such lines, there is nothing which will save the whole of Roumania from falling into the hands of the  enemy. The Russian Troops will inevitably be compelled to withdraw to the frontier, owing to the conditions of  starvation, famine and pestilence which now face them.
