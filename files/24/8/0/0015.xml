Uo. 846.This afternoon Count Predrika sent for me,  and I found him naturally much worried and depressed.   He tells me that Emperor, who has been wonderful all through, is in good health and has not in any way lost his nerve.    It is proposed for the present that His Majesty should step here. He sent me &apos;a message to say that he had received my letter and that he was sure I knew of his lasting affection for me. I shall, of course, endeavour t,o render them all, any services possible.
