[This Document is the Property of His Britftjapic Majesty&apos;s Government.] lORET.? a (i&amp; u uIMPERIAL WAR CONFERENCE.Memorandum on the Principal Supplies oe Food and Eeeding-stufes received from the british empire during the war,THE following notes have been compiled to illustrate the magnitude of the share [en by the Dominions overseas in furnishing the United Kingdom with the foodstuffs [ feeding-stuffs essential to its maintenance.   They do not profess to be complete, only to give the main items in the account.Table I shows the imports of wheat during the war, as recorded in the Board of Wheat, ule Returns, distinguishing the principal imports^ from the British Empire. Table I.From August to December 1914 the United Kingdom imported 58 per cent, of itsteat from the Empire (a figure somewhat exceeding the proportion for the whole r, viz., 52 per cent.) ; the recorded proportion fell in 1915 to 38 per cent., and fell tier in 1916 to 31 per cent. The fall in this proportion is in part due to an. actual ing off in the supplies entered as consigned from the Empire, which amounted to r 54,000,000 cwt. in the year 1914, as against 34,000,000 cwt. and 31,000,000 cwt. round numbers in.the two following years, and in part to greatly increased supplies tercd as from the United States, which amounted, again in round numbers, to 0,000 cwt. in 1914, 42,000,000 in 1915, and 65,000,000 in 1916. Unfortunately, doubtful whether the trade accounts correctly distinguish in all cases between aerican and Canadian wheat, and it seems extremely probable that the proportion of adian wheat is actually larger than appears. Otherwise the decrease in imports a the Empire is in part accounted for by the restricted supplies from Australia r 1914, owing, in the first place, to the drought of 1915, and later in great part to lenities of freight.Taking the figures as they stand, the total wheat received during the period of war from the several parts of the British Empire amounts in all to nearly 00,000 tons out of a total of 11,792,000 tons, or nearly 40 per cent., of which uida provided little less than two-thirds.In the course of 1915 the supplies received from India amounted to 698,000 tons, view of the serious rise in the price of wheat in northern India, in sympathy with simultaneous rise in other parts of the world, during the autumn of 1914 the ian Government found it necessary to restrict the export of wheat.   But in view of requirements.of the United Kingdom they arranged a scheme, in conjunction with Committee representing the Imperial Government, which, while safeguarding the  rests of India, resulted in bringing forward large supplies of wheat for the/United iigdom at a time when, owing to the delay in the American harvest, they were the utmost value to British consumers.   The quantity coming forward proved to be ver than had been anticipated, but 573,000 tons were exported from India under the leme during the months of April to July 1915.   After the harvest of 1916, private port was allowed for a time, but on the appointment of the Royal Commission on Wit Supplies, purchase for export was again placed under regulation.For the bountiful crop of 1915-16, the Australian Government arranged a scheme ktate purchase and control with the direct view of assisting the Home Government. &apos;e Commonwealth and the respective State Governments undertook the receiving, dicing, shipping, and marketing of the whole of the wheat crop of the wheat porting States in excess of seed and . feed. requirements. Government agents were [jponsible for receiving the wheat at various centres,&quot;issuing certificates, storing, and guarding it, consigning it to ports and shipping it. Arrangements were made for ft payment to holders of certificates on the basis of 3s. per bushel f.o.b. at principal l&apos;ts of shipment, the difference between the amount thus received and the averageId this and in other tables some minor imports from the Empire are omitted, as particulars are not yet &quot;lable for 1916.[416]B

(Table XIV). Table -Table XV brings together the totals of the preceding tables, and exhibits at a ,nce the principal (but only the principal) imports of foodstuffs from the several parts the Empire. Of the commodities included, some 171,000,000 cwt. have been ported from the Empire since the opening of war, out of a total of 503,000,000 cwt. mi all sources, or over one-third. This total does not include several items of which atively small proportions are drawn from the Dominions, e.g., maize from British utli Africa, Canada, India, and West Africa, and coffee from India, the British West dies, and many other parts of the Empire, nor some items, e.g., arrowroot (mainly .... tin the British West Indies), tapioca (in part from the Straits Settlements), and sago airily from the Straits Settlements), of which the total imports are not very large. I seeds and kernels (of which large quantities are imported from India and West ica) have also been omitted, although they are the basis of our home manufacture margarine and of our supplies of cattle-cake, as they are not directly a food or feeding-jlt, and form the raw material for other manufactures besides those mentioned.Ministry of Food, March 17, 1917.
