SECRET.MINISTKY W^FOOD.COLONEL JONES.Report for Week ending Wednesday, March 21, 1917.PART I. ACTION TAKEN. Orders and Announcements.The following Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations have been issued from the Ministry during the week : (1) The Freshwater Fish Order, 1917, dated March 16, 1917-This Order authorises the sale between the 15th March and the 15th June 1917, of any freshwater&apos; iish, certified by the Fishmongers&apos; Company to be freshwater fish imported from abroad or from Scotland or Ireland.(2) The Sugar (Restriction) Order, 1917, dated March 16, 1917-Article 3 of the Sugar (Confectionery) Order, 1917, restricted the use of sugar in confectionery to 50 per cent, of the 1915 quantity, as taken in prescribed periods. This Order revokes that article, and provides that the use of sugar for manufacturing purposes generally shall be restricted to&apos;40 per cent, of the 1915 quantity, again as taken in prescribed periods. An exception is made in case of jam, marmalade, and condensed milk.(3) The Food (Conditions of Sale) Order, 1917, dated March 21, 1917-This Order declares it to be an offence against the Defence of the Realm Regulations for any trader, in connection with the sale, or proposed sale, of any article of food, to impose, or attempt to impose, a condition involving the purchase of any other article. The immediate result of this Order will be to stop the practice which was adopted by grocers, with the approval of the Sugar Commission, of insisting that other purchases must be made in every case before sugar could be supplied.(4) The Swedes (Prices) Order, 1917, dated March 21, 1917-This Order fixes the maximum price of swedes or Swedish turnips at l\d. a lb. including bags or other packages. Complaint had been made in the House of Commons and elsewhere that swedes were being retailed at t\d. a lb., that is, at Id. a lb. in excess of the price fixed for potatoes.(5) The Malt (Restriction on Shipping) Order, 1917, dated March 21, 1917.-This Order prohibits,&quot; as from the 25th March 1917, the export or shipment of malt between Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. The object of the Order is to minimise haulage.Control of Supplies and Prices. rTea and Coffee Prices. The result of the conferences held with importers, brokers, and buyers of tea was publicly announced on the 16th March 1917. On and after the 1st May tea will be sold to the public at prices ranging from 2s. 2d. upwards, and 40 per cent, of the total imports will be allocated to the trade for the specific purpose of insuring a reasonable supply of low-priced tea. It was also announced that the Food Controller had arranged with the Coffee Trade Associations for an adequate supply of sound coffee, whole or ground, to be sold by retail forthwith at the rate of Is. 6rf. per lb.Potatoes. An appeal by the Food Controller was published on Wednesday, March 21st, emphasizing the shortage of potatoes and asking all those whose means enabled them to command: other varieties of food to abstain from potatoes so as to increase the supply available for those to whom potatoes are a necessary of life.Milk. On Friday, 10th instant, there was a meeting of the Advisory Committee of Wholesale and Retail Dairymen, who represented that farmers would not make contracts for the summer as they were confident that the maximum prices recently announced would be modified. The Committee regarded the position as serious and pressed for an early announcement by the Food ControUer that the prices would not be altered and that the Order fixing them would be enforced. A Press Notice on this subject and on the subject of the maximum prices for next winter has been drafted and sent to the Board of Agriculture and the Scottish Office for concurrence.   It isA  (33)2716-1   Pk 1   50  3/17   e &amp; 8 a
proposed to give an assurance that the maximum prices will be reconsideredf if the season should prove unfavourable and the cost of&apos; production be thereby increased. The announcement on the subject of winter prices will be to the effect that the maximum prices will be higher than those fixed for last winter, unless there is an improvement in the conditions of production.Flour and Wheat-The Food Controller has arranged for two members of the Wheat Commission and a representative from the Ministry of Food to confer with millers and bakers for the purpose of devising a scheme for control]ing the price of bread in relation to the price of wheat through the price of flour.Figures to show the economy effected by the Bread Order so far as relates to the prohibited sale of new bread are not yet available, but there are indications that this has. been real. The public appear to be satisfied with the provisions relating to weight, and the bakers welcome the reduction of night work incidentally involved.The local variation in the price of offals is being carefully investigated with a view to settling some basis on which it will be possible to. fix a price.Sugar. The Food Controller discussed the sugar question in detail with a large number of members at the House of Commons on Wednesday, March 21st. He mentioned the proposed issue of an Order to prevent hoarding, the provisions of which are now before the War Cabinet; and stated his intention of appointing a Committee, including two Members of Parliament, to consider whether there was in fact a leakage of supplies, and, if so, what was the best method of dealing with it. The Food (Conditions of Sale) Order will have an immediate effect in remedying one grievance of the poorer classes.Maximum Prices for Provisions. The first list of prices fixed by the London and Provincial Produce Exchanges comes up for revision at a meeting on Thursday, March, 22nd.Voluntary Rations and Public Catering.The Food Controller stated in the House of Lords on March 15th his willingness to, allow woodrpigeons and sparrows not to count as meat for the purposes of the meat ration, and his agreement with the suggestion that the rabbit might count as half value.; The draft Order for the regulation of meals, which has been approved -in principle by the War Cabinet, is being considered in detail by the Food Controller, who will confer with representatives of the trades affected before its actual issue.Miscellaneous.Imperial Food Supply.-A memorandum on the principal supplies of food and feeding-stuffs received from the British Empire during the war has been, prepared for circulation among the members of the Imperial War Conference.Consumption of Oats by Horses. There has been formed, for the investigation of this matter, an Inter-Departmental Committee, consisting of members of the Ministry of Food, War Office, Board of Trade, and Local Government Board, under the chair-manship of Mr. R. H, Selbie, general manager of the Metropolitan Railway Company. The reference relates, to&apos; (1) The reduction of the number of horses in civil use ;(2) The practicability of purchasing more horses for military use in the UnitedKingdom; and (3) The possibility of rationing horses.Brewing and Malting.Returns for ascertaining stocks of unsold malt in possession of maltsters on March 14th have been received and are undergoing, a process of analysis and compilation.Returns for ascertaining tp. what da,te the shocks of malt already in brewers hands, and amount of malt agreed by maltsters to be delivered to brewers against contracts,, will provide for brewers requirements on the reduced barrelage,, have been asked for and. are now being collected.Returns showing the amount of barley in possession of brewers, and, maltsters on Mja$ch 10th as compared; with, stocks, on February iOth have been collected. A provisional calculation shows a decrease of between 1 per cent, and 2: per cent.   &apos;
The Department is assisting the Malt 01&quot; iring House to deal with difficulties and disputes arising out of : (1) The Brewers (Malt Purchases) Order 1917, dated 3rd February 1917. (2) The Malt (Restrictions) Order 1917, dated 20th February 1917. (3) The allotment of malt under incompleted contracts. (4) Distribution of malt.PART II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION..Imports.Imports of food (Table A) during the last week (ended March 17) have been generally unsatisfactory.In all cases, except mutton, margarine, and barley, they are below the average for the first 11 weeks of 1917. In the case of wheat, oats, beef, bacon, and butter they are very much below this average. The decline of wheat is, naturally, the most serious. There the deficiency is so great that the excess shown in the last report for all the preceding weeks, as compared with 1916, is more than cancelled. The total imports of wheat to date in 1917 are now less, and not greater than those for the corresponding period of 1916.For the first 11 weeks of the present year taken together (up to March 17), as compared with the corresponding period of 1916, mutton and butter show slight increases, while margarine and cheese show considerable increases. All the other articles show decreases, which are most marked in the case of bacon, hams, barley, oats, and rice. In the case of rice the decrease of supplies is, to a great extent, apparent only. During January and February of 1917 the re-exports of rice were on an average nearly 2,000 tons per week below the corresponding average of 1916, thus largely compensating for the deficiency of about 2,500 tons a week in imports, as shown in the table. The prohibition of malting has greatly reduced the demand for barley..Taking all the principal foods shown in the table together, the imports for the first 11 weeks of 1917 are 2,196,756 tons, as against 2,591,203 tons in the corre-sponding period of 1916, a decrease of 394,447 tons, or 15 &quot;2 per cent. The greater part of the deficiency (270,830 tons) is accounted for by barley, oats, and maize.The last week (ended March 17) shows total imports of 147,794 tons as compared with 211,776 tons in the preceding week, and 235,135 in the corresponding week of 1916.   The average for the first 11 weeks of 1917 was 199,705 tons.Stocks/Wheat. The* stocks on March 19 are estimated at 1,273,000 tons as compared with 1,437,000 tons on the corresponding date in 1916, and 1,397,000 tons on March 1, 1917.Barley (apart from maltsters&apos; stocks). The stocks on March 19 are estimated at 161,000 tons as compared with 186,000 tons on March 1. Stocks in maltsters&apos; hands on February 10, 1917, were 338,000 tons and this quantity is not likely to have been substantially reduced.Oats.-The stocks on March 19 are estimated at 682,000 tons, as compared with 919,000 tons on March 1. In all the above cases the estimated stocks include farm stocks.Maize. The stocks on March 19 are estimated at 184,000 tons against 195,000 tons on March 1.Consumption of Meat.Table B gives certain figures illustrating the rate of consumption of meat this year as compared with last year. The supplies entering the Central Market, London, during January and February showed, a very substantial decrease as compared with the corresponding supplies last year. This decrease, however, has not been maintained during March. Taking the two weeks ended March 17 together, the average supplies are slightly higher for this year than for last year (6,207 tons as against 6,136 tons). Data for Manchester, though the figures can only be continued up to March 10, suggest that the fall has been maintained, but returns from Glasgow seem to runA   2716-1 A 2
parallel to the figures for London. Taking the three markets together, the supplies in January were 8&quot;4 per cent, and those in February 18&apos;3 per cent, below the corresponding figures for 1916, but for the first week of March there was an actual increase of 2&apos; 4 per cent.The supplies of fat stock at certain markets in Great Britain for the two weeks ending March 14 (Table C) show practically no change in the numbers of fat cattle, a very slight fall in the case of fat sheep, but a considerable decrease in the number of fat pigs. These returns also suggest that there has been some check in the decrease of consumption as compared with last year.Wholesale Prices.In Table D, the latest wholesale prices as compared with those of the week before, show a considerable fall in the case of bacon, butter, and cheese. This is due to the arrangements made between the Food Controller and the Produce Exchanges for fixing agreed maximum prices. In the case of tea, no comparative prices can be given owing to the absence of sales. Linseed shows a slight fall, as does also linseed cake and cottonseed cake. Most other prices show a fractional rise.As compared with the prices of a month earlier, mutton shows a fairly sub-stantial rise, amounting to as much as 9 per cent, in the case of English and b\ per cent, in the case of Argentine. Rice shows an increase of 7 per cent, and Canadian cheese an increase of 6 per cent., whilst Irish butter, English cheese, oil seeds and cake show small decreases. Wheat and flour, barley, oats, maize, beef and bacon show small percentage increases, amounting to not more than 3 per cent, or so.If the comparison be made with the prices of a year ago, oats, maize and cheese show increases of 50 per cent, to 60 per cent., as do also linseed cake and palm kernel cake.The increase in the case of rice, beef, bacon (average of Irish and Canadian) and butter lies between 40 per cent, and 50 per cent., while in the case of English wheat it amounts to 36 per cent., and in the case of mutton, on an average of English and Argentine, to a little less than 30 per cent.
