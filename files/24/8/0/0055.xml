BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.  205^ny further communication should be dressed not to any individual by name,[10-   .the director general, the food production department, 72, victoria street,london, s w. 7. j should quote the reference number and ate of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address: &quot;Growmore, sovvest, london.&quot; telephone: victoria 8240.The Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 7.21st March, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to submit the Report of the Food Production Department for the week ending Tuesday, 20th March, 1917,The policy of the Department for the moment is to concentrate all efforts on increasing production for the harvest of 1917,     In view of the lateness of the season and the limited amount of labour and mechanical power available, it Is felt that this will be3t be achieved by assisting farmers to make the best possible use of existing arable land,  so as to secure the largest possible output of those crops which are most needed, rather than by diverting labour and machinery to bringing into cultivation fresh land which could not yield such large crops.     Executive in most cases, are using the tractors on existing arable, the cultivation of which is in arrear, in fresh grass land, and are encouraging fertilisers, which can be supplied onCommittoesbreakinguppreference to the increased use of credit through the schemewhich has been arranged wdth the Banks.     As soon as the urgentwork of spring cultivation for this completed, Committees will be urged for the harvest of 1918, and as the and with the stimulus of guaranteed a very large increase in the area of cereal year.year&apos;s harvest has been to make greatly enlarged plans number of tractors increases, prices, there is every hope of arable land during the nextI,     LOCAL ORGANISATION.Amendment of Regulation 2M.   An Order in Council was made on tho loth March, extending the powers conferred by Regulation 2M in three ways,(1)   By giving power to requisition machinery and implements, not in the possession of a dealer or manufacturer, as well as farm produce, animals or stock, which aro required generally for tho purpose of cultivation, (The power to requisition was previously limited for the purpose of cultivating land of pfMch possession had been taken)(2)   By giving power to let land cf which possession has been taken.(3)    By giving power to determine the tenancy of an-r land not being so cultivated as to increase the food supp^, or to authorise the landlord to do so.The two former powers have been delegated to County Executive Committees who have been empo?rered when they have taken possession of land, to let it for a term of two years expiring at the usual period of quitting.     The Board has, however, reserved in its own hands the power to determine tenancies, and County Committees have been informed that the power to determine will be very
sparingly used,  and that the position of the outgoing tenant will &quot;be safeguarded.The Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917, No.3, has been made taking the place of the earlier Ordor of that name, hut incorporating its provisions, except that County Executives are no longer empowered to take possession of common land without tho specific consent of the   Board. - By this   Order the Powers of the amended Regulation 2M are delegated to County Committees except as above stated.     The opportunity has been taken to introduce into the Ordor certain amendments which have been found to be required on minor administrative matters.Work of War Agricultural Committees.General - The Executive Committees in almost all counties are now hard at work and the preliminary surveys having been completed, they aro going through the returns and taking action where necessary, either by issuing directions to negligent farmers to improve thoir cultivation, or, in extreme cases, by taking over their farms and either cultivating them themselves or arranging for their cultivation by neighbouring farmers.     Landlords are being urged to uso thoir influence on their estates in favour of better farming and in several cases the pressure of the Committees has resulted in- notices to quit being given, or in the tenant being induced to give up at once.     In the Eastern Counties vigorous action Is being taken to check the uso of land for luxury crops, such as mustard for seed or colery, and in some counties these crops may only be grown under permits.Speaking generally the Committees are working with real keenness and enthusiasm and the few backward Committees are being dealt with by the Eoard&apos;s Commissioners, and by means of the personal interviews, which Sir Ailwyn Pell owes is having with the Chairmen.Sanction has been given to the appointment of Sub-Commissioners to assist the District Commissioners in the various Counties, and arrangements have been made for the appointment of ton Sub-Commissioners at once, most of whom will begin work immediately.     Further appointments will be made from day to day whore necessary.     One of tho principal duties of tho Sub-Coinmissionera- will be to keop in close touch with the local Sub-Committees in each District and see that they are working effectively.The following are instances of specific action taken in various Counties during the past week.Birmingham - Tho Executive Committee have arranged changes of tenancy of two holdings aggregating 90 acres, and have served notices on 11 occupiers to improve thoir lands.Buckingham - The County Committee have been authorised to take Possession of a holding of 130 acres at St.Leonard;    they arc Ploughing 99 acres of this with a Caterpillar Tractor.

They have also succeeded in bringing about changes of tenancies, repair of cottages,  and assistance by landlord to tenant and by one farmer to another/Somerset - At the request of the Committee the Landlord has boon authorised to determine the tenancy of a neglected farm of 47 acres at Wambrook, subject to the tenant being given an opportunity of stating any claim ho desires to make.Suffolk, East -   Most of the ploughing in this county has been done, and the corn-drills are at work,Suffolk, West - Notices to cultivate according to the Committee&apos;s requirements for the 1917 crop have been given as to 16 holdings aggregating about 1,000 acres, as well as notice with regard to the 1916 crop,Sussex, East ** The Committee have been authorised to take possession j of a holding of 160 acres so as to effect immediately a change of tenancy which&apos; tfcK^lcl not otherwise have taken place till the 11th October,Yorkshire, East Riding - The Committee have issued a number- cf notices to cuToivato in accordance with their requirements. -   They have also arranged in several cases with the owners to effect changes of tenancy.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917,  (No,2.)Particulars have been received as to the&apos; operations in 431 boroughs or urban districts.     63,546 applications for plots have been made, and 47,987 plots have boon provided, comprising an &apos; area of 3,208 acres,Middlesex has provided plots for all but 10   of its 6,323 applicants, the total area provided being 342 acres,Horticultural Section,A Circular has been issued urging the importance of immediate cultivation of all available land to Workhouses and infirmaries through the Local Government Board;    to Asylums through the Board of Control;    to   Reformatories tnrough the Home Office/An appeal lias boon issued through the Press to gardeners to raise under glass seedlings of cabbage&quot;for distribution to small cultivators in their neighbourhood in order to make good tho losses re suit ing f r om tho 1 a to . fr o s t, s .A Memorandum lias also boon addressed to Head Masters of Public Schools urging that each Public School Boy not immediately Preparing for the Army should cultivate not loss than five rods of ground.
II. TECHNICAL AMDADVISOR?Durinr tho week - largo number of inquiries and suggestion.; Pave been received relating to tho fcoding of stock:   the cultivation of crops, especially potatoes;    the uso of manures.:    labour saving - implements: * and the depreciations of birds, rats and insect posts.Three sub-committees of the Technical Committee have met and considered problems connected with (1) tho economical use of feeding stuffs,  (2) the treatment of grass land and the purchase of grass seeds,  (3) crops suited to present conditions,A bulletin has been drafted containing suggestions as to tho production of winter food for stock on grass farms devoted to dairying, and further reports arc in course of preparation.     A Memorandum has also been prepared on the - dipyinc of waste food from military camps  and town households,At the request of the Metropolitan Asylum Board two officers of the Department have inspected four farms under the control of the Board, and have drawn up a full Report on each farm with recommendations for its improvement,III,   LABOUR.Soldier Labour -   The temporary release of skilled ploughmen for agricultural work from all units in this country as well as from France for the Spring Cultivation has placed some 15,000 skilled men at tho disposal of the Department in addition to the 12,500 men of the Home Defence Force and 10,000 of the Agricultural Companies previously allocated to agriculture.     Information received up to the present shows that about 14,400 soldiers, inclusive of men of the Agricultural Companies have been taken up so far by farmers.     Information is lacking, however, at present as to the numbers of men sent out in 12 of the Counties since the 10th inst.It has taken the Committees some little while to get farmers notified of this opportunity of employing labour, hut applications are now coming in steadily in most parts of the country.     There has been some reluctance to take up the men in some counties, mainly due to two causes:    (1) the farmers&apos; IP. .r that by engaging the soldiers they would prejudice the position as regards recruiting of their remaining culled men, and (2) the fact that the men will under present arrangements be withdrawn on April 15th, leaving tho farmer with a goo   deal of the work only partially done,Some counties such as Devon (1091), Essex (761), Pent (1069) have made splendid progress, others, such as Berks. (225) Cambridge (58), Dorset (90), Leicester (136), arc backward.Horses,     The additional supply of labour has led to a further demand for horses in some counties, many farmers having reduced their stocks to correspond with the reduction in the number of their men.     The Director of Remounts has been asked to assist as far as he possibly can in this matter by allowing as many horses in Remount Camps as possible to be sent out on loan, even at long distances from the Camps. &apos;   He has also beenasked to reduce the present charge of 4/- per horse per day to 2/9 per horse per day in cases where horses are kept overniaht by the farmer, who thus has to provide stabling and extra forage.
anitural Rftteouyers and Munition wortta, eta.    - Maa quaotian ofr^TtHrarTaB&quot;bu^ers leaving the land to take up more remunerative *iovment is one of increasing importance.     Managers of Employment hlnres and Munition Factories have been warned that agricultural irers are not to be taken for other employment.     In a recent case Government Contractor engaging farm workers, after representation the Board, the Ministry of Munitions telegraphed to the Contractors fat all agricultural workers were to be at once dismissed.A press notice has been issued jointly by the Department h the Ministry of Munitions pointing out to munition workers who are illed ploughmen that it is desirable they should return to the land L ttle ploughing season, and promising their re-instatement when toughing is finished.is oners of War - In addition to the two batches of prisoners r5rrecTto in fast week&apos;s report, two further batches are expected be out working in a few days at Lewes and Huntingdon.     As regards le release of individual interned aliens, good progress has Icently been made in this matter, and 582 such men are now out on !rnis.Women&apos;s Branch.   jj (JCounty Organising Secretaries have been appointed in all but ur counties.     The Headquarters of 27 County Committees have been orabout to be established in the local Employment Exchanges, lection and Allocation Committees have been set up in 35 counties, is estimated that the number of vacancies for training in England !d Wales at Colleges and other Centres amount to 1,040, in addition ny individual farmers have offered to undertake training.The Girls&apos; Friendly Society has offered the use of their stel for girls out of work and temporarily unfit for work at the st of board only.The demand for women labour in many places is negligible regards whole time work, but there is evidence that gangs of cal women under the control of a leader would be welcomed by many rraers.     It is too soon to gauge the effect of the National Service peal, but in London some 500 applicants have boon interviewed, of om the large majority were unsuitable.MACHINERY SECTION.tor Tractors.   During the week, a further 42 Government-owned actors have been received;   33 Caterpillar tractors have also been livered, making a total of 151 Government owned tractors available, e Department are also controlling 429 privately owned tractors and oughs, of which 56 were mentioned in last weok&apos;s Report.     The total fflbor of owiied and controlled Tractors now available is therefore 580.A further 75 tractors are expected to arrivefrom America QHly, leaving undelivered 361:,of the 515 originally ordered.The Director of Supplies and Transport is lending the partment 100 A.S8C, men experienced in the&quot; driving of Caterpillar actors, 50 of these are receiving special additional instruction Lincoln, and the total number will: be appointed one man to each chine to the tractors at work on the land,     The response to the Peal made to private owners to place their tractors under the con-Ql of the Department may be considered as very satisfactory.     As consequence, no steps to enforce the recent Order authorising the to commandeer tractors are contemplated at present..In addition to the 23 motor engineers mentioned in last ek s Report 253 have been appointed this week.^-T3iMe    Applications for the return of specially classified n have been mada in addition to the 118 mentioned in the last P^t,     30 men have also been ordered to return to civil employment, King a total under this head of 69.     48 men will be recalled from ance subject to the consent of the General Office^ Commanding.
IV.    SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs SectionSulphate of Ammonia.     The scheme for the payment of the Government Grant in respect of the cost of delivery of sulphate of ammonia by rail has now been approved by the Treasury, and a letter has been sent to-the Sulphate of Ammonia Advisory Committee explaining the matter and asking for their concurrence.Superphosphate,.     The purchase has beep concluded of 4,500 tons of superphosphate at Lisbon and a ship has been chartered by the Ministry of Shipping, and instructed to proceed to Lisbon and lead at once.     The port of Hull has been selected for discharge as being a convenient centre from which the superphosphate can be distributed to th? Eastern Counties, which are much in need of this fertiliser.A   provisional offer has been received of a cargo of 3,400 tons of American superphosphate due to arrive in this country, and negotiations are proceeding.Maize.     The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies have approved of the suggestions made by this Department as to the proposed regulation of the price of maize.     The Department will issue each week a press notice stating the price at which maize is sold at ports by the Distributing Agents of the Commission and indicating the additional charges for railway transport to the principal inland centres and the allowances for cost of handling that are considered reasonable. On the basis of this information purchasers should be able to protect themselves a.gainst excessive prices, and the Department will investigate any cases in which escessive prices appear to have been asked.The Royal Commission have also agreed to a suggestion that maize should he reserved for human consumption and for feeding to stock, and have written to the Ministry of Food recommending the immediate issue of an Order prohibiting the use of maize for industrial purposes except by licenoe.Seeds Section.Seed Potatoes.   The position has become more difficult during the woek.     At the beginning offers of Scotch Seed were coming in fairly vrell, and the Committee of buyers which is acting for the Depart-ment was satisfied that they could execute orders up.to 8,800 tons. At the end of the week, however, offers had ceased coming in, and not more than 7 ,,000 tons can now be expected from Scotland.     The reason alleged is that the prices fixed by the Food Controller are being ignored, and that seed is being secured by other purchasers at higher prices than the Department are authorised to offer.The Irish Department have agreed to licence the expert cf 6,500 tons from Ulster, viz.0 5,000 tons for this Department said 1.500 for the Army Canteen Committee.     Mr. Campbell of the ,rrish Department was authorised by the Bfcod Controller to offer  10.0.0 per ton to grov/ers, and dealers were expected to handlei load and supply bags for a charge of 25/&apos;- per ton.&apos;     The Chief Secretary and Mr, Campbell himself anticipated no difficulty in getting all the seed wanted on these terms, and Mr. Campbell proceeded to Belfast as soon as he received authority from the Food Controller to make tho
purchase.     He now reports that the dealers ask for 4o/- Der ton for their services and he is satisfied that as an inducement to the farmers   to sell quickly we must offer  10. 10s. 0 per ton.     He thinks that if this offer is made and held open till April 7th, all the seed required by the Department will be forthdcming, but that:to lie safe it would be desirable to offer farmers  11 per ton.7,000 tons have &quot;been purchased and the Department have still to purchase 4,500 tons for allotment holders.    At laast 6,000 tons will fee purchased if they can be obtained, and if any further ] supplies can be secured from Scotland, part of the Irish seed will be sold to some of the many applicants for seed potatoes who write tt the Department.The Ministry of Pood has been urged to enforce the prices set out in their Orders.     If this were done the difficulties now being experienced by the Department would, to a great extent, . disappear.During the week consignments of seed to thirteen L$ al Authorities have reached their destinations and every effort is being made to expedite the despatch of the seed already purchased. No complaints as to difficulties in securing trucks have reaohed us, and the Railway   Companies, under the instructions of the Railway Executive Committee, are doing their work satisfactorily.     firders for 1,000 tons of seed for twenty-one Local Authorities were placed betv/een the 13th and 20th inst;   the total orders sent out ,i?y the Department now amount to 8,137 tons.Vegetable Seeds.   Enquiries are in progress as te supplies.     On the whole the position and outlook are both satisfactory.     Parsnip seed is scarce because of last yearns weather, and certain kinds of cauliflower, broccoli, onions and leeks, will be scarce because of the sinking of an Italian cargo.     Since the War the sources of supply have been altered and seed is now being imported extensively from California.Seed Trade.     A deputation was received from the leading members of the Seed Trade on the subject of trade price lists.     They assert &apos; that their sales will suffer greatly if they are prohibited from sending lists to their usual customers.     Thoy ask to be allowed to send price lists reduced 50$ in size to customers whose names are on their hooks,I an,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, MAP.,President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
