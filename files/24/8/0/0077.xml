SECRETSHIPPING RESOURCES COMMITTEE.Interim Report. (March 24th, 1917).We were appointed pursuant to the instructions of the War Cabinet of March 2nd, 1917, to the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty to set up a Committee to &quot;examine exhaus-tively and report on the prospective Shipping situation in the event of a continuance of the war during 1917-18&quot;.We are not able to make a complete review of the subject until we have received further information, which is being obtained by the Shipping Controller.     But from the figures already submitted to us, the situation in regard to the immediate future appears so serious that we consider it our duty to recommend that steps should be taken forth-with further to restrict imports, and no matter what diffi--     - &quot;  .V. V - -    ...&quot;culties may be involved, to build up a reserve of wheat. The seriousness of the position is shown by the fact that in the period April to August (inclusive) of this year there will only be available 60% to 70^ of the shipping tonnage required to carry the imports necessary for civilian requirements and for munitions.  ,This estimate is based on the assumption that the full programme for the supply of munitions to Russia is continued, that the entrances of neutral ships into our ports remain at the reduced rate to which they have been diminished by losses and by fear of the German submarine campaign, and that the losses by submarines will continue at the rate prevailing since February 1st.     The First Sea Lord has expressed the opinion that for the next 3 months these losses will tend to increase rather than to diminish. Full allowance has been made for the restriction of imports which has already been put in force.Even if the Russian programme be reduced the situation will not be materially affected.     Any reduction
of shipping sent to Russia would result in a corresponding re-duction of the return cargoes of food supplies from Russia, which would have to be replaced by shipments from other sources.The above estimate (60% to 70%) is necessarily conjee-tural owing to the exceedingly uncertain character of the available data, especially as to the future rate of shipping losses and the degree to which neutral ships may come back into the service of the United Kingdom.     When this is said we are , satisfied that the deficit in carrying power will be consider-able, and we understand that the Shipping Controller has esta-blished a Tonnage Priority Committee, upon which the responsi-ble importing Departments and the Board of Trade ace represented in order to adjust the demands of each Department for carrying power as the occasion demands, and, if necessary to present outstanding points to the War Cabinet for decision.The gravity of the situation is accentuated by the fact that we are at present.living in part on our home supplies of wheat.     The wheat stocks in tne country at the moment amount to about 10 weeks&apos; supply, at the present rate of consumption, and the incoming shipments during the period up to August will not balance the amount consumed, with the result that at the end of July it is estimated that there will not be more than 7 weeks&apos; supply in hand.     Even this amount cannot be relied upon as being available, as the possibility of loss by raiders or submarines of the wheat or part of it in transit to this country has to be taken into account.     Some saving of wheat may be expected as the result of the Food Controller\a Orders, but it will be only secured by drafts upon other cereals - barley, maize, rice, etc.In the opinion of the Pood Controller 6 months&apos; supply of wheat   or other breadstuffs is the lowest reserve that is compatible with safety, in view of possible emergencies. In order to increase our present stocks to 6 months&apos; supply, the import of an additional 2,000,000 tons of wheat or other cereals within the next 6 months is required, involving the
withdrawal from other services of 533.000 tons of shipping. This is not provided for in the estimate of normal require-ments referred to in the second paragraph of this report.*We are informed that, owing to under-estimate of the Canadian and United States harvests,  there is avail-able in those countries an unexpected reserve of wheat, which would be sufficient to supply our deficiency. Difficulty in taking full advantage of this circumstance has been experience by the Wheat Commission owing to the fears of the Treasury that the American Exchange would be seriously affected if further large supplies be drawn from that quarter.     A large stock was bought in Australia under the apprehension that the Canadian and American supplies would be inadequate, and a large part of this stock remains at our disposal in Australia;   but the point of primary importance in this connexion is that the voyage from Australia takes four times as long as the voyage from North America. In view of the shortage of tonnage it would be disastrous to rely upon the Australian supply.We, therefore, recommend :-(l) That steps should be taken immediately to cut downimports other than foodstuffs to the fullestpossible extent. (2) That a Cabinet instruction should be given to theWheat Commission to obtain from the United Statesand from Canada all the wheat that is availablethere, without regard to any considerationsaffecting the American Exchange.We are considering to what extent the tonnage difficulty would be relieved by the abandonment of the Salonika Expedition or any of our other Overseas commitments, but we have not yet before us all the figures necessary to enable us to arrive at a conclusion.     It must be borne in mind, however, that any relief to be obtained by this means would not occur until the evacuation was completed and the
transport and supply ships released;   and could not he effective until some months hence.     This part of the problem has, therefore, no bearing upon the immediate difficulty.(Signed)       EDWARD CARSON.Chairman.Estimated weight of Goods required by United Kingdom fOr purposes of United Kingdom, Prance, &amp;c, 1917.In Thousand Tons.Ministry of Pood (exclusive of special import of Wheat)       ...Civilian requirements reduced by Restrictions of Imports   ... ...War Office and Office of Works       ... ...Ministry of Munitions ..,946    1,113   1,19.39442^2 1,498255&quot; 258 1,507   1,483286 1,413April      May      June      July      August1,0171,428     1,413   1,569     1,475      1,543300 1,413TOTAL :-   4,124     4,288   4,503     4,ll8      4,273The requirement month.
