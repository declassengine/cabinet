MEAT IMPORTS AFTER THE WAR.To the War Cabinet:The late Cabinet, being apprehensive of the effect which the large European shortage of meat after the war might have on the quantities arid cost of our imports of refrigerated meat, appointed last summer a Committee of their number to consider what steps, if any; should be taken to safeguard our supplies.    The Committee, which consisted of Lord Hafccurt, Mr Runciman, Mr Bonar Law, Ilr Balfour, Mr Mcfcehria, Mr McKinnon Wood, and Lord Crawford, held three or four meetings, and came to the conclusion that as regards supplies from sources within the Empire, there need be no anxiety, as the.cooperation of the Colonial Governments could be safely assumed.    They approved certain measures for assisting British firms to extend our sources of supply, but as these would for a few years be of a small and tentative nature, it was thought important to ensure supplies from the River Plate, by entering into a contract with the principal meat Companies established in Argentine and Uruguay, including the American ones, which latter might otherwise be tempted by high prices to carry their meat to other markets.The Committee accordingly instructed Sir Thomas Robinson, who has throughout the war been assisting the Board of Trade in the matter of meat-pur chases, to open negotiations with the British and Foreign Companies trading in the Plate, with a view to their entering into agreaments with H.M. Government, that would ensure for this country for five years or so amplesupplies
supplies of refrigerated meat at a reasonable price.    This has been rather a difficult matter, owing to the uncertainty of conditions for some time after the war, but fair progress has been made, and it is necessary for the Government to decide whether the proposal should proceed.    If this is approved, as I hope will be the case, I suggest that a small Committee of Ministers should be appointed to deal with the outstanding points calling for decision, one of these being the question whether we should treat only on behalf of British consumers, or whether, as France is also exercised over this matter, we should also take into consideration their interests.20th March, 1917.A.H.S.
