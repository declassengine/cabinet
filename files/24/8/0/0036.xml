Off. 236g nclit&apos;&apos;   f1&apos; &quot;OT?T&quot;F&apos;1   Rii-TUASli OF MiLU FOii MILITARY SiiiVIC:., PJTICjj 0? WORMS. Memorandum by Sir. A. Mono. Bt. M.P.frune mnis cor*-The G-aestion of releasing further men from m--Department. espocially class A men has been occu vying my attention;   Up to tho present time no real and definite instructions no :ear to have boon given by either the Cabinet the  :ar Office, or the Man Power Board as to the relative importance of reissuing men for the Irmy and of continuing the efficient work of departments.     In the absence of such instructions it is very difficult either for the Minister responsible or the Department chiefs to decide as to the relative balance of advantage to the Government service by the employment of their man power.I have further to remari that no definite instructions are known to have been given as to the acceptance of any changes in the high standard of accounting and financial procedure ruling in peace time. It is obvious that this renders it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to -re-lease for military duties, men who have been trained in thespecially detailed routine and complications of Governments ----accounts, and to  Provide substitutes unacquainted with the technicalities of the Government service, who underall human probability, will make a number of errors in dealing with this hind of work.    It is impossible for the responsibl Minister to insist that a course of procedure shall befollowed in the release of nun which will render tho account-ing chiefs subject to adverse comment ...nd reproof by either the gTeasury, the Comptroller and Auditor General or the .Public Accounts Committee.I would respectively submit that the Government should decide whether it is more important for the Army to have soldiers or for tho national accounts to be kept with the same metriculous care as it peace time..    In my opinion such a demand is unreasonable and some form of indemnity should be given as long as the best efforts ate made that arc possible In the present crisis.A further point that arises Is the ewtremely low scale of salaries permitted by the Treasury for clerical work In the service.   This renders the task of finding efficient substitutes from outside for temporary work extremely difficult. I would submit that the responsible Minister should be given authority.to engage such substitutes at such salaries as he-,1-vLhis advisers shall consider -reasonable under the circumnt-   -  &quot;In submitting this memorandum I cannot imagine that, this department alone is effected by tho consideration I h-av a set forth and that they do not apoly   to a cohsasdorab. e degree to other departments.&quot;  The lact that no uniform instructions on this guest ion have been issued renders the task oi the Minis-tor anwious to release as many men as possible espeeiallrygnvidions as the argument is used that other do )artments. act on analogous lines.    I b&apos;og to &quot;enclose a minute I wrote for the guidance of ay officers when I assumed office0(intd) A.MrOffice of &quot;Jerks.-&amp;prd robruary, 1917
In view 01 the demands for tho further re33n.se of men from the establishment of this Office for ill Id t dry purposes, I   ish to lay down for the guidance of the honartment the following points.-I consider it of -oaramount importance that all men fit for active service, that is Class A should be released. I consider that other questions must be subordinate to this consideration,    I would however distinguish between men of techinal training engaged in such branches of the works of the Po-)artmont who aro directoddy connected with the Par Office and Munitions work.    These men should not bo released for service until in every instance their names have beer, specially submitted to any sanctioned by me.   as regards men employed on work of an important character in other branches it cannot -.e admitted that some diminution in the effeciency of tho service which map result can be taAon into account as offering sufficient reason for exemption from Class A. service,   it is obvious that the same efficiency cannot be expected from a dooletec; Piaif, supplemented by temporary help, a^ from the highly trained staff usually at tho Command of the iiv- r-rtmcnt, and the Heads of Pivisions cannot be held to the same responsibility fgp delay, bad work, and Iosp of vublic money as would be the case in norami times.A.II.Office of vsarks. hoc .;i:A-or 101QWhitehall Gardens, .3* 7* 22nd parch 1 17.
