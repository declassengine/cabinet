MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.

By Minute of 27th February the War Cabinet confirmed the decision that during the period of State guarantee of agricultural prices rents should not be raised, and the Secretary for Scotland was requested to examine the position in Scotland with special reference to the law relating to Teinds.

The Principal burden upon teind, which is a charge upon land, is the stipend of the parish minister. The stipend, as a rule, is not expressed in terms of money but as "victual" i.e. it consists of so much, in measure, of the various articles of agricultural produce produced, or assumed to be produced, on the land. It is not, however, paid in kind, but in cash, and the cash value of the "victual" is calculated year by year at the average market prices of the year. These average market prices are fixed for each county under an ancient semi-judicial procedure, and the prices so fixed are known as "fiars prices". Accordingly, the stipend rises and fall with the rise or fall from year to year of the "fiars prices" for the county. Speaking generally, the surplus teind, that is, the balance, if any, of the teind after the stipend is paid remains in the hands of the landowner, and the only question, therefore, which it seems necessary to consider in connection with the policy of guaranteed prices and fixed rents is what, if any, effect these may have in relation to the burden of stipend.

Guaranteed minimum prices. The Government scheme as outlined in the draft Bill now under consideration, proposes that where the average market price for the year is less than the minimum price as fixed in the Bill the grower shall be entitled to a sum equal to the difference between
between the two prices for the whole of his produce. Under this scheme market-prices, and therefore "fiars prices", would be unaffected, and that being so, stipend, too, would be unaffected.

Fixed Rents.

The draft Bill contains alternative proposals for dealing with this matter, but these deal only with the case where a landlord is in a position to give notice to terminate the tenancy, that is, where the lease has come to an end. In a country of long leases, such as Scotland is, it is obvious that a provision of this nature would only operate in a limited number of cases i.e. only where leases came to an and during the currency of the statutory provision. Even in these cases an unrestricted right to raise rents would probably not enable the landowner to pass on to the tenant any material portion of the greatly increased burden of stipend for the rise in prices which has caused this increase is due partly to the increase in the cost of production and partly to conditions of scarcity which are presumably temporary.

On the whole, therefore, it seems unnecessary in the Bill under discussion to take any account of this stipend question. A similar conclusion appears to have been reached as regards tithe rent-charge in England, which, it is understood, is a burden analogous to stipend.

Apart, however, from the Bill, there is no doubt that the very large increase since 1914 in the amounts which fall to be paid for stipends, coming as it does along with increases of other burdens on land, is felt as a considerable grievance by land-owners, and the Secretary for Scotland is considering whether the matter might not properly be the subject of inquiry by a Departmental Committee.
