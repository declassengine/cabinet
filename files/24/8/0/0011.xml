SECRET G.T. 211WAR , CABINETCoal : for   Italy.(Bettor from Sir A, Stanley to Sir M, Hankey)Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,In reply to your letter of the 17th .March on the subject of the supply of coal to Italy,  I think /that all I can do is to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the very grave   position which has now been reached.I understand that the Italian Dolegates on the Commission Internationale de Ravitai11 ement estimate the total quantity of Ccal that will be delivered in Italy during the period March 1st - 31st will amount to 385,041 tons, or 48.13 % Of their requirements.     In this connection it must be observed that this figure of 385,041 includes a considerable quantity of the coal supplied by the. Admiralty as an emergency measure, which is now beginning to arrive in Italy,&quot;but which, of course, will not continue.I am further informed that the quantity of coal which it is estimated will arrive in Italy during April next amounts to only 320,000 tons,  or 40^ of their requirements  .      The above quantities include coal from all sources including the parcels of coal brought from the United States of America.There does not appear to be any possible action by the Board of Trade which will relieve the situation, but having regard to the present and prospective shortage, which may lead to most serious results, I think that the War Cabinet should have this matter.under their consideration. /.tYours sincerely,(Signed)    A.K. STANLEY.Board of Trade . March 19th, 1917
