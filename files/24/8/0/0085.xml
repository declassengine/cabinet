FOE WABTHE  JlRCAiiTILE   MRIiti  AND  THE   SAPPING  PROGRAMME.(1)  The British Empire possesses over 16,000.000 gross tons of steamships of 1600 tons and over, but about one-half of this tonnage is either allocated wholly to the special war services of the Army, Navy, the Allies., and the British Dominions, or is abroad engaged in various local trades, ...   .. ,.x including tho coastal trades of the British dominions. Thus the tonnage available for the supply of the United Kingdom with its essential foods and materials, whether for the civilian population or for war purposes, is little more than 8,000,000 tons.    As the shins specially allocated tend to increase rather than to diminish, the whole of the War and marine losses (the latter boing abnormal) fall uPon that part of our shipping devotod to the Services of the United Kingdom, with the result that our imports are continuously diminishing.(2)   For a number of reasons it is exceedingly difficult toestimate in advance what tonnage will actually be availablein the near futuro.   As to our own shins, we do not know what theloss from the enemy attack will be, and tho only safe assumptionis that the recent rate of loss among vessels of 1600 tons andover - 250,000 to 300,000 tons per month - will not diminish.There is also uncertainty as to how many shins it will be  -possible to acquire by purchase.   The rate of output of newmerchant shins in the United Kingdom is limited by the demandsof the Admiralty for warships, and for the whole of 1917 is not- &apos; llikely to be moro than 750,000 tons.   Hew shins purchased abroad jmay
may reach 250,000 tons, (making 1,000,000 tons of new shipping in all)   but these cannot produce any substantial benefit until late in the year.   As to the foreign ships serving United Kingdom norts, the element of uncertainty is even greater.   It is estimated that in tho month of February cargoes brought into the United Kingdom by foreign ships amounted to only 445,000 tons as compared with 878,000 tons in January.   In view of the highly-conjectural nature of the available data it is only possible to say that it is unlikely that the imports into the United Kingdom in 1917 will exceed 33,000,000 tons..  As our imports in 1916 exceeded 43,000,000 tons, it will be seen that the position is very serious.   Even allowing for all wo hopo to do in shipbuilding and purchase from abroad, it annears to be probable that the British shipping available for bringing commodities to the United Kingdom will be decreased by the end of 1917 by fully one-fourth of the amount available at the beginning of the year.   This to some extent explains the expected reduction of imports by about 10,000,000 tons but the difference is also due in.a considerable measure to the heavy reduction in foreign shinning to which reference has already been made,(3)   The uinistry of Shipping has set up a Tonnago PriorityCommittee and requested the various Departments interested in imports to formulate their requirements for carrying power in approaching months.   The result io to show that thore is an enormous demand for tonnage in excess of the available supply. In the following statement the demands of the Departments are contrasted with the tonnage which can probably be carried *-IMPORTS

At the current meetings of the Tonnage Priority  Committee the Departments are being asked to revise their demands in view of these figures, and it is obvious that it will be necessary to make some very serious restrictions and adjustments to equate demand and supply.If the wheat supplies of the ilnited Kingdom are to be increased to give six Months&apos; reserve,, which is considered imoortant by the Pood Controller, the requirements would be increased and the deficit would bear a much worse asoect. .The figures which have been estimated are,, it must be insisted, highly conjectural,, owing to the uncertainty which attachos to any attempt to forecast the rate of loss of either British or neutral shipping,...or tho extent to which the latter iiay be made available.....I i HI
(4)   In this connection it must again be pointed out that roughlyone-half of the shipping of the British Empiro is employed in special services.   These services are approximately:Gross Tons(a)	Army	1,700,000(b)	Navy	2,000,000(c)	Allies	1,800,000(d)	The British Dominions and India	800,000(e)	Ships on United Kingdom register trading abroad	1,000,000(f)	Ships on British Dominions &amp; Colonial registers	trading abroad 750,0008,050,000(5)  The import position of the United Kingdom has bocomo soserious that it certainly appears that tho whole question of the diversion of about 8,000,000 tons of shipping from home supply needs the most careful reconsideration.   As to tho Army and Navy, an investigation by this Ministry of employment is proceeding, and it is hoped may yield somo economies, but larger questions arise.    It may be pointed out that the Eastern and African expeditions employ the following shipping:No. of Ships Gross TonsSalonica 150 660,000Egypt 58 250,000Mesopotamia 100 510,000East Africa 25 125,00QTotal 333 1,545,000These
These ships, if employed in tho services of the United Kingdom, would give ultimately an additional importation in a year of about 6,000,000 tons of cargo.   Is to British ships used by the Allies, in view of the grave shortage of essential articles in Prance and Italy, it is difficult tc see how tonnage can be withdrawn without seriously impairing their fighting efficiency.(6)  As to the item (e) in the table in paragraph (4), apartfrom requisitioned vessels, thero arc 210 United Kingdom rogistered vessels trading permanently in distant waters, (107 passenger vessels and 103 cargo vessels).   Of these 15 are in Australian waters, 31 in Canadian waters, and 164 in Indian and Chinese seas.   The 164 are engaged in Indian coastal trade (e.g. carrying coal from Calcutta to Colombo, supplying Rangoon - which has no railway communication - etc.); and in the Chinese coastal trade.   For the most part they can scarcely be taken away except so far as they can bo replaced by neutrals.   lany of the Chinoae vessels, though under British registry, are owned by Clii*iese.(7)  Of Colonial registered vessels (item (f) in paragraph 4)194  (46 passenger and 148 cargo) are permanently in distant waters, 95 in Australia, 56 in Canada and 43 in or noer India and China, their employment being similar to that indicated in the preceding paragraph.   The Dominions have had an urgent appeal from tho Prime Minister to give vessels (whether on U.K. -or Colonial registry) now in their coastal trades, whether by reducing requirements, substituting land transport, or replacing by neutrals which would refuse employment to United Kingdom. All the Dominions have replied that they are investigating tho possibilities.   It is of the greatest importance that they should release as many ships as possible,   oven at such sacrifice as is being endured by this country.   It must, however, bo borne in mind that the vessels referred to are those left after a good deal of &quot;combing-out&quot; and that some of them are engaged in employment of great importance to the dominions.
7,(8)    It should he observed that in the endeavour to make aslargo a proportion as possible of British shipping serve the United Kingdom in this crisis, ships are being taken out -of their accustomed trades, as whon, for example, cargo liners to Australasia are diverted to the Atlantic.   Steps are being taken in this way in order, by using ships on the shortest possible voyagev to economise tonnage, but these steps are fraught with grave present loss,eand the risk of permanent injury to the national interest.   Shipping lines which have been built up by assiduity and enterprise during long years are being depleted of tonnage, with the result that a great opportunity is presented to the foreign shipowner.   At the same time the calling home of our ships from distant waters reduced not only imports from those Dlaces but our exports to them, which means not only present loss to British traders but the prospect of permanent injury in important markets.ferch 20. 1917
j^MORANDIM PROM THE MINISTRY OF SHIPPING FOB THIS IMPIjRIALCONFERENCE.SiliKYIuJSS RENDERED BY OB TO TUB DOMINIONb aND INDIA SO FAB AS THE PROVISION OP SHIPPING AND TRANSPORTS IS OONOliRKED.1.-0i anTroops.    Since the beginning of the War  53*390 troops ant . 41,105 horses have been conveyed from Canada to England.The first contingent of about 34,00^ men came over in September 1914.Arrangements for: requisitioning the Liners were made by the Canadian GovernmentiThe vessels sailed under escort provided by the Admiralty. In Hay and June 1915 a second contingent was conveyed^Vessels were requisitioned by the Admiralty * and placed at the disposal of the Canadian Government.After this date regular Canadian Liners were used instead of requisitioned Transports.    These Liners carried troops on their homeward voyage for which a fixed rate of freight per head was paid.:    The arrangements were made in Canada.Tho number of troops to be conveyed sometimes however,exceeded the space available on Liners.    The Admiralty thenassisted with requisitioned Transports,    Towards the end of1915, space on the &quot;LAPLAND^!, &quot;3AX0NIA&quot;, &quot;CEDUNA&quot; and &quot;CALIFORNIAwas requisitioned.    During 1916 the following Transports v/ereused:- Total number oftroops carried.&quot;OLYMPIC&quot; 10 trips 55,557&quot;MAURITANIA&quot; 2 trips 5,895 &quot;EMPRESS OFBRITAIN&quot; 7 trips 26,316&quot;CARONIA&quot; 1 trip N   4,261iiSl &apos; 92,029Stores
StoresPrior to February 1915 &quot;Jar Office purchases in Canada were carried by merchant shins.    After that date it was necessary to use requisitioned Transports for the service.To begin with 14 Transports were engaged, but owing to the large increase in stores of all kinds, purchases by the Ministry of Munitions, V/ar Office, Admiralty, and other Depart-ments of His Majesty,r.s Government, particularly munitions, forage and foodstuffs, tthe number of Transports necessary steadily increased.There are now 55 Transports on the Canadian store service, averaging 6 or 7 sailings per week, and the total quantity of stores carried up to the end of 1916 was over 2,000,000 tons.The service has, on the whole, worked well, loading and despatch in Canada being excellent in spite of railway diffi-culties in the winter.During this winter the facilities at St. John and Halifax have proved inadequate and it has been found necessary to divert a portion of tho traffic to Portland, Maine.    During the last month purchases of grainy munitions^ fish, meat and raw material have g^eatlj? increased and it has been found necessary to requisition dpace in Liners running ts Canada *Release of steamers.   The Canadian Government have also co-operated recently in inducing the Canada Steamship Lines to place in the Atlantic trado steamers employed on the Great Lakes, and it is understood that they are also negotiating with the Company with a view to their releasing four mw of their vessels from the West Indian trade.2 - INDIA -     ; Since the beginning of the War the Government of India has provided all the tonnage required for conveying troops,horses
horses and stores from India to the various ports of the world in which Indian troops have he en employed.    Thus the Indian Expeditions to Prancej Egyptj&apos; Mesopotamia and Bast Africa have heon carried out almost entirely by Transports requisitioned by the Government of India without the intervention of His iiajestyfs Government.    To a large extent this practice still obtains, but tho Ministry of Shipping is how keeping in close touch with India as regards Transport arrangements and it has been agreed that India shall not reouisitioh further shipping without consulting that Department.    I/hen fresh requirements arise full particulars will be telegraphed by India together with proposals for meeting them and it will be frequently possible to meet these require-ments by ships near or in Indian waters already under requisition to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Some of the ex-enemy steamers controlled by the Govern-ment of India have carried cargoes or part, cargoes for His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. - mm&amp;k --.. Troops,    Since the beginning of the war 290,000 men and 37,864 horses have been carried outwards from Australia.The Commonwealth Government have from the commencement of hostilities made all arrangements for the conveyance^ Egypt and to the United Kingdom of their Expeditionary Force and reinforcements&apos;.    They have requisitioned raid fitted out their own Transports and generally carried out all the necessary Transport arrangements outv/ards from Australia.Apart from tho services performed by these ships in  , conveying Australian troops and horses, the Australian Transports have proved invaluable in conveying Imperial troops, horses and stores as follows &apos;(1) Many
(1)  Many of these ships have been employed for long periods running between Mediterranean ports.(2)   The great majority of tlio Australian Transports which have come on to U.K. have on their return journey to Australia been used for the conveyance of troops etc. as shown below, the ships being diverted as necessary.(a) From U.K. to Mediterranean ports.(b) From U.K. to India and aesopotamia..(c) From U.K. to South Africa, with troops en route toIndia and Mesopotamia.(d) From U.K. to East Africa.(8)   From West Africa, with Natives to East Africa.The return of invalids and unfits from the U.X. to Australia has also been carried out h? Hospital Ships provided by Australia and by Australian Transports respectively, while the Australian Hospital Ships on their voyage to U.K. have been used for the conveyance of Imperial invalids from Bombay and Egypt. : -Assistance has been rendered to Australia by Eis Majestyfs Government as follows!-Two Hospital Ships have boen fitted out at Southampton, Australian Transports have been watched while in U.E. ports and assistance has been given by Transport Officers in facilitating despatch.Transports used for conveying returning unfits have been fitted out by His Majesty1s Government.4 - NEW ZEALAND -The arrangements made by New Zealand, for the conveyance of their Expeditionary Force and reinforcements, were similar to those made by Australia, though of course the-operations
operations have been on a much smaller scale.    Until recently the New Zealand Transports as a rule proceeded to Egypt only and the ships therefore were seldom available for viImperial Service after disembarking their troops at duoz.    Since these ships have been coming on to the United Kingdom thoy have been used on their return journey much in the same way as the Australian Transports.The arrangements for the return of invalids and unfits from U.K. to New  ealand are identical with those made by Australia, the only difference boing that the Hospital Ships were fittod out in New Zealand instead of in this country.The assistance rendered to New Zealand in this connexion by His i.lajesty&apos;s Government consists in taking their transports in hand immediately on arrival and preparing thorn for their return voyage as quickly as possibles5 - SOUTH AFRICA - .&apos;The Transport arrengomonts for the South Uest African -Expedition were made entirely by the Union Government without the intervention of. Eis Hajesty&apos;s Government.The Transport arrangements for the conveyance of the South African Expeditionary Force and reinforcements to U.K. and for the Union Expedition to German East Africa have been carried out by His Majestyfs Government through tho Naval Commander- in Chief of the Cape.The South African Government have recently given up their only two ex-enemy ships to load wheat from Australia (s.s. &quot;HALiF and &quot;APOLBA&quot;).    Only tho first of these has in fact been so used, and that Government may claim the use of equivalent tonnage for the sleepers which the steamer might have carried from Australia, to South Africa.
3.    SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE METHOD IN iTEIOH THE DOMINIONS AND INDIA CAN ASSIST FURTHER. I.    ?HE REQUISITIONING Off SHIPS,Many difficulties Have arisen in practice in adjusting the relations between Eis Majesty&apos;s Government and those of&quot;the Oversea Governments so far as this question is concerned.    The matter has now been raised in a formal manner by the Government of Canada in a Minute of the Privy Council. Canada, date the 30th January, 1917, of which a copy is attached.    In connection with this Minute the whole position has been reviewed by the Departments of His Majestyfs Government concerned, and the following suggestions have been made with a view to a settlement of the matter from the point of view of the practical exercise of the port of requisitioning by the several Governments concerned.    If those suggestions are found, after discussion, to afford a practical solution M the difficulties, it would seem to be unnecessary to go further either into the legal or constitutional aspects of tho question or into the extent of the Prerogative referred to in the Canadian Minute.The proposals put forward for acceptance are asfollows: -(1)  That the requisitioning authority should bp regarded as vested in and only be exercised on behalf of the Government of that part of the Empire in which tho port of registry of tho Vessel is situated.    (For the purpose mentioned in this and tho succeeding paragraphs port in, tho Colonies not possessing responsible Government are to count as ports in the United Kingdom),
(2) When tho vessel is in the territorial waters of apart of the Empire other than chat in which the port of registry is situated, as a mat tor of-form the requisition will subject to the reservation in Clause 3* bo served through the machinery of the Government of that port of the Empiro in whose waters tho ship may be at the time.(3) Where a vessel registered in the United Kingdom isengaged in the coastal trade of a Dominion, or in trade between two Dominions,-or in other employment which the Dominion Governments have stated to be vitali His Majestyfs Government will consult the Dominion Government before requisitioning.    Conversely, in the case of a vessel registered in a Dominion, that Dominion will in similar circumstances consult His Majesty1s Government or other Dominion Government before requisitioning..   In either case, it is recognised that in the last resort the wishes of the Government in whoso country the vessel is registered will prevail.(Mote.    It would facilitate matters if it could be arranged that tho Dominion Governments would supply in advance a list of tho ships registered in the United Kingdom engaged in their vital trades, and that any change in such ships should&quot; similarly be notified from time to time.    His Majesty!s Government are prepared to furnish similar information to Dominion Governments as regards ships registered in the Dominions conoerned).(4) In viow of the&apos; practical difficulties of ascertainingat v/hat port a vessel happens to be registered at a given moment, and in order to prevent attempts at evading a contemplated requisition, it would be convenient if the port of registry on
a given date, e,g. 1st January 1917, we.ro taken as determining where the requisitioning authority (under the principles stated above) lay for the period of the war and a. reasonable period afterwards (say 12 months).    This would obviate tho diffi-culties referred to without affecting the present law governing the registration of British ships.
II.       THE ELIMINATION OF CARGOES QTHEB THAN ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES AND ./AR SUPPEIES FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM AND HER ALLIES.The policy indicated under thie and the succeeding head has already boon suggested to the Self Governing Dominions and India in a general manner. It has been pointed out to the, that the tonnage situation is a very gravo one owing to the large war losses and the demands of war transport  or the United Kingdom and hor Allies.    These demands, apart from the carriage of food-stuffs, now absorb more than half the remainder of the available British Ocean-going steamers, and the situation is accentuated by the reluctanco of Neutral owners to bring their ships to the United Kingdom.    For th&amp;se reasons His MajestyTs Government consider it important to avoid the allocation to non-essential services of any Ocean-going British steamers which can be possibly utilised to carry war supplies or essential commodities for .the Countries engaged during the liar.    The Dominion Governments have been asked, therefore, to cut down their requirements for shipping and also to free for war purposes any Ocean-going vessels at present employed in the coastal.or other trade of the . respective Dominions.Promises cf co-operation have boen roceived from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and Newfoundland.So far as the question of the elimination of cargo other than essential commodities and war supplies for the United Kingdom and her Allies is concerned, the Ministry of Shipping feel that the policy indicated should be broughtbefore
before the Imperial Conference as an urgent question requiring the early and serious attention of the Governments of the Self Governing Dominions.    In this connection it isvsuggested that attention might he drawn to the recent list of commodities the import of which into the United Kingdom has ijeen forbiddeni    It should also be pointed out that in promising their co-operation; Australia have gone further thaii the other Self Governing Dominions, and have undertaken that the Commonwealth Government will support the wishes of His Majestyfs Government with regard to the cargoes to be carried for the national noeds of the United Kingdom.    It is suggested that tho Dominions and India should be asked to agree formally to the principle that in tho present emergency the primary consideration as to the cargoes to be loaded must bo the needs of the importing allied countries in Europe,Further measures can, however, be taken to reduce the waste of tonnage space, if the Self Governing Dominions would take steps, not only to limit thoir exports to the United Kingdom and her Allies, but also to reduce the importation into their Countries of non-essential commodities whore this would result in a saving of tonnage..    This limita-tion would not apply to exports from the United Kingdom or her Allies in Europe from which freight space will usually bo available,    The elimination of non-essential imports into the Dominions from other sources than those mentioned -might, in appropriate cases, free a large amount of freight space, which could bo divertod to more essential trades. An instance of this policy as regards South Africa may be &apos;given
given.    His Majestyfs Government have recently asked the Union Government to prohibit the importation of Motor Oars, which occupied a large part of the tonnage between the United States and that Dominion, and that Government have undertaken to bring in a Bill to give them the necessary power to do.so.V
III.    TH5 BBDUOTION OF COASTAL SHIPPING.As already stated under II, the Self Governing Dominions and India have boon asked to scrutinize their coastal shipping with a view to releasing ocean-going British steamers engaged therein.for tho use ^f His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and her allies. :   It has be on suggested to them either that requirements could be x*educed,or that ships now engaged could bo replaced by land transport or by neutral vessels, and it has also been pointed out that many neutral owners would prefer to engage their ships in areas free from war risk.The Shipping Controller would be glad if the importanco of this question to H.,:. Government could be emphasisod at the ConferenceiIt might also be pointed out that there are a number of vessels employed in Dominion waters probably suitable for Commissioned service as minelayersseaplane carriers, or armed boarding steamers.    Their actual suita-bility however, cannot bo- judged without inspection.-   . It would bo an assistance if detailed plans could be placed at the disposal of the Ministry of Shipping if it is thought that any of tho ships might be released.    The allocation of some of the (tugs now employee; in South African waters for work in submarine areas in assisting damaged ships would also be much appreciated.
IV.  PRIZE AND DETAINED ENEMY VESSELS.The question of the control of these ships is one which has long heon under tho consideration of the Colonial Office, and it is unnecessary to deal with the matter here, beyond referring to the fact that it is one in which the Controllers Department is indirectly interested, and on which an early decision is desirable
MERSHAHi.SHI EIEMS IN THE UNITED KINiSDCM.Very early in the war practically the whole ship-building facilities of the United Kingdom were required for Naval purposes, hut in October 1915, it was seen that it was necessary to provide that at least a small proportion of these facilities should be engaged on Merchant Shipbuilding.    There was.at that time a very large number of merchant ships in various stages of constructions, and the actual position of these ships was examined with a view to the completion of those which could be finished in the shortest time.   Facilities were then given through a system of certification for these ships to be finished.Month by month the need for more merchant tonnage has made itself felt, and more and more ships have been certified and allowed to be built:, but owing to the increased severity of the submarine menace, and the larger demands for over-sea operations it became evident during the latter part of last year that the supply and maintenance of tonnage had become of -paramount importance.One of the first steps the Shipping Controller took was to appoint a SHIPBUILDING ADVISORY COMMITTEE representative of the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering industries;   This Committee was instructed to prepare designs of Standard ships and to ascertain where they oould be built,For the past three months the Committee has been at work and, in addition to preparing designs plans aid specifications of Standard vessels of four types and consider-ing the question of designs of further types, they have reviewed the vessels already under construction and arranged for the work on certain types of vessels to be deferred for the time.This
This was necessary because of the length of time required to complete them and in order that concentration might be effected on Standard ships, which could be built more quickly and which are more suitable to present needs.106 Standard ships have already been ordered and of these 7$ are in the-fely stages of construction.  As further shipbuilding berths become vacant they will be filled with Standard ships.   It is anticipated that;;generally speaking, a Standard ship will take from five to eight months to complete, but there is -considerable difficulty in obtaining adquate supplies of material and labour to carry out the programme as quickly as is desirable.At the present time there are about 200 merchant ships building in addition to Standard shipsj of about 870*000 tons gross, the construction of which has been certified to enable it to proceed.   Given adequate facilities, the greater part of this tonnage could be completed in the next seven or eight months.22nd Harch 1917.
OVERSEAS SHIP. PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCTION.The only neutral or allied countries capable of dealing with merchant shipbuilding on an extended scale are -.JAPAN . UNITED STATESwith the addition of two or three small yards at Hong Kong and Shanghai.UNITED STATES.   Prior to the VJar, the Shipbuilding resources of the U.3.A. were of a limited character but since tho outbreak, much development has taken place in this direction and a large number of new shipyards have been established and are now in active operation.Realising that the U.S.A. offered the greatest opportunity of speedy construction, representatives, commercial and technical, were appointed in New York and authorized to make.the fullest enquiries.As a rosult it was found that Norwegians had practically secured a mOnO^Jy of the early deliveries, and steps were immediately taken to buy out the I-orwcgian owners of existing early contracts and ships on point of delivery, and systematically to secure all possible berths for deliveries up to the end of 1917 and in suitable cases up to August 1918.JAPAN.    In Japan we found a large building programme in progress and are in close touch with all early deliveries, having secured a number of vessels.In respect of deliveries later than the end of 1917, it was found that the builders wore dependent almostentirely
Included in above are three oilers building in U.S.A. and two second hand oilers purchased by this department for the Admiralty.entirely on steel from either U.K. or U.3.A. and as this cannot he supplied, no reliance can he placed on promised deliveries but where We are assured the steel is in stock or in transit, contracts have been placed.SHANGHAI &amp; Egg KONG.

AO-OPERATION m SHIPBUILDING BETV7EEN THIS UNITED KINO-DOM ADTHE SLLF-GQTONING DOMINIONS AND INDIAMEMCEANDUM by the SHIPPING CONTROLLER &apos; for the information of the Special -7ar Cabinet Meetings with Representatives of *;he Dominions and India.CANADA.    Full information has been obtained with regard to the capacity of the Shipyards in the Dominion of Canada building steel ships.   The Imperial imnitions Board at Ottawa arc in touch with the Yards and orders have already been placed through them as follows:-(1)   The T/estern Dry Dock, Port Arthurj Ontario, one ship 4,000 tons; due July 1917.Coghlans Yard, Vancouver, two ships of 8,800 tons each, due December 1917.The Wallace Shipyard, Vancouver, two ships of 8,800 tons each, due  March 1916.Authority has been given to the Controller^ representative now in America in combination with the Imperial Munitions Board, Ottawa, to arrange a full building programme in other available yards on the Seaboards East and West,On the Great Lakes the Yards are limited to steamers of 1500-4100 deadweight.   This limitation is due to the fact that the dimensions of the ships constructed in the Lake Yards have to bo such as to allow them to pass througi the T/elland Canal en route for the River St. Lawrence.   The  Shipping Controller has fixed dimensions which will provide for boats 3,200-3,500 deadweight on a draft of 20 ft. to 20 ft.10, and the Imperial MunitionsBoard
Board have be on asked in consultation with the Controller^ representative to place orders with all the Canadian lards On the Lakes for boats of these sizes.(2)  Wooden, Steamers.   The Controller^ representative is going fully into the position in Canada in relation to these but tho advice generally received is1 hot favourable.(3)  A numb or of ships are building in tho Dominions for Norwegian owners but the Shipping Controller does not propose negotiations for the purchase of these ships as it is understood that the Canadian Government will be prepared to requisition all this tonnage provided that H.M. Government will take the responsibility for any diplomatic trouble with Norway which may result i   The Colonial Office have been asked to inform the Canadian Government that H.M.Government are quite willing to agr-eo to this and to ask the Canadian Government to take action accordingly.(4) INDIA. Enquiries arc being made with rogard to the possibility of building ships in India.(5) AUSTRALIA, NHT7 ZEALAND. SOUTH AFRICA &amp; NEWFOUNDLAND. There are no shipbuilding facilities in these Dominions which can bo utilised by H.M. Government.
