General situation remains very serious.I have had telegrams from various Generals Commanding Army Groups in support of intention to continue war to victory.   The position howerar in Petrograd and elsewhere with the soldiers is serious^ disturbed.I know Alexeieff is very anxious and there are signs of restlessness among staff Officers here who have been in depu-tation to him with regard to action against Voyeikof etc.,It appears doubtful if Grand Duke Nicholas will he accepted as C-in-C and if this is so we will lose what would, I think have been a strong card in pulling the armies togetherReports from the Baltic Sleet are better and the men are said to have expressed regret at having kille d the Admiralreferred to before.Count Erederiks has, it is said, been arrested atCornel.( Repeated to Ambassador ).
COPY.SECRET. OPERATIONS.From   - General Hanbury-Williams to C.I.G.S.   March 19th 191?856.   I was sent for this morning by the Empress-Mother and we had a long conversation in her train.     Her Majesty went over much old ground regarding history of Impress and Rasputin, &amp;c. but I need not go into this now.The points for immediate discussion was the plans of the Empero who declines to (word apparently omitted) anywhere without Empress.     A telegram has been sent to Russian Government at Petrograd asking for permission for him to join Empress and their children at Tsarskoe Selo, and an ans?/er to this is await ed.     I told Her Majesty that we Chiefs of Allied Military Missions were prepared to do everything possible for the pro-tection of His Majesty, and were prepared to travel with him also and see him at any moment.   1 was asked by Her Majesty to express to my colleagues her most grateful thanks for the syrn-pathy which I told her she had invariably from all of us in the sad and (word apparently omitted) state of affairs which now existed, and she was most grateful for all I told her of what had been done in the way of helping matters on with Army etc.It was not the moment to go into the question as to who isand who is not to blame.   The protection of His Majesty and thetranquillisation of mischievous forces which are now at work inin the (word omitted) and Army of the Russian Empire are theimmediate considerations.     Her Majesty told me that Emperorhad abdicated on the advice of General Husski v/ho was with himat Pskov when the Government deputation came down to see him;that she believes that the other generals were in accord withBusski and felt it very hard that such advice should have tobe given.    General Ivanoff, placed in the most difficultposition, had been most loyal and sympathetic, and she couldnot speak too highly of what he had done.    Of course the factthat the Emperor will not be separated from his wife andchildren is the crux of the situation and the difficulty.    Itold/
told Her Majesty I had already telegraphed to the Government regarding plans for Emperor going to England.    She is alarmed by the question of the sea voyage and would prefer it, I think, if their Majesties went to Denmark.   I assured Her Majesty that not only on account of the special connexion of our Royal Family with her I was anxious to place at her disposal any service that I could render, but that I had the absolute support of every representative of Allied Powers here.As I was leaving the Grand Duke Alexander stopped me and spoke of the very dangerous and serious condition of the country at the present moment, and of German influences acting on the working classes for stoppage of war on the part of Russia.   He suggested it would be useful and indeed of the first importance if representatives of Allied Pov/ers would telegraph to their respective Governments urging that they be put in possession of a memorandum which they could, when necessary, present to Russian Government at j?etrograd, representing that we are now, i.e. all the Allies, engaged in this war against Germans, in fact one great Power, and that we recognise and intend to support the existing Russian Government at Petrograd.    They have declared their intention to continue war against Germans, and as one Power composed of various Allies we mean to win the war.    The Grand Buke suggests this memorandum should be in the hands of every representative of Allied Powers so that when the moment arrives each one could show it simultaneously and publish it. German intrigue and mischief is corrupting the working classes throughout the country, and obviously playing for separate peace on part of Russia.    I urged the importance of the arrival of Grand Duke Nicholas at the earliest possible moment and the Grand Duke agreed with this.   He v/as afriad, however, that there was some difficulty owing to fear that some revolutionaries might delay the train or cause difficulties en route, and that before he made the&apos; journey it had probably been found necessary to make enquiries as to this.    I told him part of n^r conversation withthe Empress and informed him that we military representativesof/
of the lilies were prepared to travel to Tsarskoe Sfelo with the Emperor leaving Embassy Staff Officers to carry or for the moment.   He said that he not only thought this necessary but urged me most strenuously to insist on it even if it were against the wishes of the Emperor.   This is the situation at present, and a decision will be come to as soon as we get an answer from the Government, which is to be communicated to me directly it arrives.   Both I and my colleagues are telegraphing to our respective ambassadors and ministers in the sense of Grand Buke&apos;s suggestions.    I then made a suggestion to him that he should, in conjunction with some of the Grand DukeS   also issue manifesto to the people asking them to support the Government and the workmen to continue working for the war.    He said he thought this a useful measure but only a secondary one to that of declaration by Allied Biplomatie Representatives referred to above.    I have had a meeting of my colleagues since the inter-view referred to above, and without going into private details of my conversation with the Empress-Mother I have communicated to them what passed.     Such action as I have taken will, I trust, be agreed to by the King and approved of by the Government. I should like to add that throughout a most anxious and difficult time my colleagues have most readily fallen in with all my suggestion   and given mei every support.   My sincere thanks are due to them.   As the doyen of Allied Representatives much responsi-bility has fallen on me personally, as I have been called up in all cases alone.       I desire to place on record the excellent (one group undecipherable) rendered by my Staff Officer, i^ajor Maitland Edwards, and also by Lieut. Porters during a critical period. Repeated to Ambassador.
