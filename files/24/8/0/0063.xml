From General Hanbury-Williamsj to C, I. G, s,March 22nd 1917.I,   To-night I had a long conversation with Alexieff, who sent for to speak, as he said, quite unofficially.   He tells me that limpsror i Empress, and I conclude also the children, are now under arrest at irsklj that so-called Government has now had to give way to the rers of anarchy,although as a Government it still existed.   He begs to telegraph at once to request that H.M,Government should make ingest possible representation that absolute safe conduct should be /en to whole Imperial family to ROMANOFF and to England as soon as ssible. He fears for safety of their persons if such action Is not :en at earliest possible moment.iher GEORGE has been arrested and there are Indications that these roup omitted)will continue.   Alexieff says that the Emperor does not ilize his danger yet but since the anarchists are top dogs his position becoming very dangerous.    I therefore hope that all steps possible i be immediately taken.KAHD OF ARMY. Grand Duke Nicholas is shortly expected here,   Sx-3rae parties will do all to prevent his appointment as C.In C. It is ;od that our own and all Allied Governments will press upon the Russ-.i Government to retain the services wf this great soldier.     Not -7 is he honoured and beloved in the Army but he is also popular with 3 people and Alexieff is sure of success with the Army if his appoint-at can be effected, Alexieff has grave fears    ( unless we exert 5*7 influence and use every possible power of Allies   as   well as &quot;selves to get this carried out ) as to what may happenrin Russia regard to the war.   I am communicating (lgp) this to all my col-agues and am asking them to aend similar messages to their own Govern-ats,       i told Alexieff that I hope that the result of the abovemight be successful but that I unfortunately placed no faith in
the Government, whose representatives told me&apos;through Alexieff that they would guarantee safe conduct of Emperor to TSARSKI and to Romanoff and I and my colleagues were thus induced to abandon the idea of accompanying him, but I saw at the same time that those who are.supposed to be governing Russia were the only persons whom we could approach officially.In regard tO Grand Duke Nicholas my French and Belgian colleagues are taking action with their respective Governments but they beg me to excuse them not repeating to their Diplomatic representatives in Petrugrad as they do not hold their tongues.
