C R B t &quot;.T.-222&quot;WAR CABINETM0RA3DUM FROM TEE HINISTRY OR SHIPPING FOR THE IMPERIALCONFERENCE.SERVICES RENIHR5D BY OR TO THE DOMINIONS AND INDIA SO FAR AS THE PROVISION OF SHIPPING AND TRANSPORTS I,S\CONCERNED.CANADATroops.     Scince the &quot;beginning of the War, 253;-390 troops and 41,10^ hoi&apos;S-8 3 have been conveyed from Canada to England.The first contingent of about 34,000 men came over in September 1914.Arrangements for requisitioning the Liners were made by the Canadian Government.The vessels sailed under escort provided by the Admiralty. In May and June 1915 a second contingent was conveyed,Vessels were requisitioned by the   Admiralty, and. placed at the disposal of the Canadian GovernmentiAfter this date regular Canadian Liners were used instead of requisitioned Transports.     These Liners carried troops on their homeward voyage for which a fixed rate of freight per head was paid,     The arrangements were made in Cana.da.The number of troops to be conveyed sometimes however, exceeded the space available on Liners.     The Admiralty then assisted with requisitioned Transports.     Towards the end of 1915,  space on the &quot;LAPLAND&quot;,  &quot;SAXONIA&quot;,  &quot;ORDUNA&quot; and  CALIFORNIA&apos; was requisitioned.     During 1916 the following Transports were used:-Total number of troops carried. &quot;OLYMPIC&quot; 10 trips 557557&quot;MAURITANIA&quot; 2 trips 5,895&quot;EMPRESS OF BRITAIN&quot; 7 trips 26,316&quot;CARONIA&quot; 1 trip 4,26l92,029Stores.     Prior to February I915 ^ar Office purchases in Canada were carried by merchant ships.     After that date it was necessary to use requisitioned Transports for the service.To begin with 14 Transports were engaged, but owing to the large increase in stores of all kinds, purchases by the Ministry of Munitions, War Office, Admiralty, and other Depart-ments of His Majesty1s Government, particularly munltions, forage and foodstuffs, the number of Transports necessary steadily increased.There are now 55 Transports on the Canadian store service, averaging 6 or 7 sailings per week, and the total quantity of stores carried up to the end of 1916 was over 2.000,000 tons,The service has,  on the whole, worked well, loading and despatch in Canada being excellent in spite of railway difficulties in the winter.During this winter the facilities at St. John and Halifax have proved inadequate and it has been found necessary to divert a portion of the traffic to Portland, Maine.      During the last month purchases of grain, munitions, fish, meat and raw materiel have greatly increased and it has been found necessary to requisition space in Liners running to Canada.
-2-Eeleaso of steamers.     The Canadian Govern^nt have also co-operated recently in inducing the Canada Steamship Lines to place in the Atlantic trade steamers employed on the Great lakes and it is understood that they are also negotiating with the Company with a view to their releasing four more of their Tessels from the West Indian trade.2.xJ- IlTpIASince the &quot;beginning of the Jar tho Government of India has -rovided all the tonnage required for conveying troops, horses and stores from India to the various ports of the worl5. in which Indian troops have been employed.     Thus the Indian Expeditions to Prance, Egypt, Mesopotamia and East Africa have been carried out almost entirely by Transports requisitioned by the Government of India without the intervention of His Majesty18 Government*     To a large extent this practice   still obtains, but the Ministry of Shipping is now keeping in close touch with India as regards Transport arrangements and it has been agreed that India shall net requisition further shipping without con-suiting that Department.     &quot;.7hen fresh requirements arise full particulars will be telegraphed by India together n?ith proposals for meeting them and it will be frequently possible to meet these requirements by  hips near or in Indian waters already undo requisition to His l:a;jesty1 s Government.Some of the ex-enemy s to amors controlled, by the Govorn-ment of India have carried cargoes or part cargoes for His lfa3estyTs Government.3- AUSTRALIA   .&apos;  Troops.     Since the beginning of the war 290,000 men&apos; and 37,864 hor3es have been carried outwards from Australia.The Commonwealth Government have from the commencement of hostilities made all arrangements for the conveyance to Egypt and to the United Kingdom of their Expeditionary l?orce and reinforcements.     They have requisitioned and fitted out their own Transports and generally carried out all the necessary Transport arrangements outwards from Australia.Apart from the servio.es pBrformed&apos;by those sh ips in conveying Australian troops and horses, the Australian Transports have proved invaluable in conveying Imperial troops, horses and stores as fallows(1) Hany of these ships have been employed for long-periods running between Mediterranean ports.(2) Tho great majority of the Australian -Transports which have come on to U.E. have on their return journey&quot; to Australia toon used for tho conveyance of troops, etc, as shewn below, -the ships being diverted as necessary.(a) ?rom TJ.h. to Koilitcrranean Ports.(b) Erom 17.II. to- India and   Mesopotamia..(c) 5&apos;rom U.Il. to South Africa with troops en route to India and Mesopotamia.XL) Erom U.h. to -iiast Africa6) Prom lest Africa with lativcs to East Africa.4   ^   The return of invalids and unfits   from the U.J1&quot;. to Australia has also been carried out by Hospital Ships ProvidedAustralia and by Australian Transports respectively&quot;, while the Australian Hospital SMps on their voyage&quot; to U.Z.vhave oeon^usod for the conveyance of Imperial invalids from Bombay ano. Egypt.
Assistance has &quot;been rendered to Australia by His Ha j estyx s Gowrnment as follows:-Tro Hospital Ships hove he en fitted out at Southampton, Australian Transports have &quot;been watched while in U.E. ports and assistance has ho en given by Transport Officers in facilitating despatch.Transports used for convoying retaining unfits have been fitted out by His Majesty1 s Government.4. - m* zii-iAiraThe arrangements made Jjy lew Zealand, for&apos;the conveyance of their Expeditionary Porce and reinforcements, ^rere similar to those made by Australia, though of course the operations have boon on a much smaller scale.     Until recently, the Hew Zealand Transports as a rule proceeded to Egypt only and the Ships therefore were seldom available for Imperial Service after disembarking their troops at Suez.     Since these ships have boon coming on to the United 1&apos;ingdom they have been used on their return journey much In the same way as the Australian Transports.The arrangements for the return of invalids and unfits from TJ.K. to Hew     Zealand are identical with those made by Australia, the only difference being that the Hospital Ships wore fitted out in Hew Zealand instead of in this country.The assistance rendered to How Zealand in this connexion by His Majesty1 a Government consists in talcing their transports in herid immediately on arrival and preparing thorn for their return voyage as quickly as possible.5. r SOUTH APHIOAThe Transport -arrangements for the South west African Expedition wore made entirely by the Union Government without the intervention of His MajestyTs Government.Tho Transport arrangements for the conveyance of the South Afclean Sxpe&amp;itionary Force and reinforcements to U.E. and for the Union Expedition to German Bast Africa have been carried out by His Majesty1^ Government through the $aval Commander in Chief of the Cape.The South. African Government have recently given up their only two ox-cnemy ships to load wheat from Australia (s.s. &quot;HAM!&quot; and &quot;APOLBA&quot;).     Only the first of these has in fact been so used, and that Government may claim tho use of equivalent tonnage for the sleepers.which the steamer mi?ht too carried from Australia &quot;to South Africa.jj i
B. SUGGESTIONS AS-SO TEE KSTKOJ) .IIT MICE THEDOMIHIOIJS AffD IHDIA CAff ASSIST ETOCKESUI. THE IGOJJISITIOHIIIG OF SHIPS.Many difficulties have arisen In practice in adjusting the relations he two on His Majesty1, a Government and those of tho Oversea Governments so far as this question is concerned. The natter has no\; been raised in a formal manner by the Government of Canada in a Minute of the Privy Council, Canada, dated tho 30th January, 19.17-, of which, a copy is attached. In connection with this Llinute the whole position has been reviewed by the Departments of His Majesty1s Government con-corned, and tho following suggestions have been made with a vie&quot;/ to a settlement of- tho matter from tho point .of view of tho practical exercise of&apos;the&quot;power of requisitioning by the several Governments concerned.   If these suggestions are found, after discussion, to afford a practical solution of the diffi-calties, it would seem to be unnecessary to go further either Into&apos; tho legal or constitutional aspects of tho question or into tho extent of the Prerogative referred to in the Canadian Minute.The proposals put forward for acceptance are as follows: -(1)        That tho requisitioning authority should bo regarded as vested in and only be exorcised on &quot;behalf of the Government of that part of tho Empire. In which the port of registry of tho vessel is situated,    (for the purpose mentioned in this and tho succeeding paragraphs ports in&apos;the Colonies not possessing responsible Government arc to count as ports in the United ICingdom).(2)       Tflien the vessel is in the territorial waters of a part of the Empire other than that in which the por^ox registry is situated, as a matter of form the requisition will, subject to the reservation &quot;in Clause 3&quot;, be served chrougn wie machinery of the Government of that part of the Empire ib woose Waters the ship may be at&apos; the time.(3)       YAioro a vessel registered in the United. Kingdom is engaged in the coastal&quot;trade of a Dominion, or in trade botwoon two Dominions, or in. other employment which thC( Dominion&apos; Governments have stated to be vital, His Ma jes:cy s Government will consult the Dominion Government before rocuisitioning.     ConvorSoly, in the case of a /ossol registered in a Dominion, that Dominion will in similar circumstances consult His Majesty1 s Government or other Dominion Government before requisitioning.   In cither case, it is recognised that in tho last resort tho wishes^of;tho Government in whose country the vessel is registered mil prevail,(lloto.   It would facilitate matters if it could be arranged that the Dominion Governments would supply in advance a list of tho shins registered in the Unit Oil Kingdom engaged in their vital trades, and that any change&apos;in such ships should similarly be notified from time to time,     His Majesty1^ Government aro prepared to furnish similar information to Dominion Governments as regards ships registered in the dominions concerned.)
In view of the practical difficulties of ascertain-ing at what port a vessel happens to he registered at a given moment, and in order to prevent attempts at evading a contemplated requisition, it would he convenient if the port of registry/- on a given date, e.g., 1st January, 1917f were taken as determining where the requisitioning authority (under the principles stated above)    lay for the period of the war and a reasonable period afterwards (say 12 months),     This would obviate the difficulties referred, to without effecting the present law governing the registration of British ships.
THE ELIMINATION O? CARGOES OTHER THAN ESSENTIALCOMMODITIES AND WAR SUPPLIES FOR THE UNITEDKING-DOM AND HER ALLIES.The policy indicated under this and the succeeding head has already been suggested to the Self Governing Dominions and India in a general manner.      It has &quot;been pointed out to them that the tonnage situation is a very grave one owing to the large war losses and the demands of war transport for the United Kingdom and her Allies.     These demands, apart from the carriage of food-stuffs, now absorb more than half the remainder of the available British Ocean-going steamers, and the situation is accentuated by the reluctance of Neutral owners to bring their ships to the United Kingdom.     For these reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it important to avoid the allocation to non-essential services of any Ocean-going British steamers which can be possibly utilised to carry war supplies or essential commodities for the Countries engaged during the War.     The Dominion Govern-ments have been ashed, therefore, to cut down their requirements for shipping and also to free for war purposes any Ocean-going vessels at present employed in the coastal or other trade of the respective Dominions.Promises of co-operation have been received from Australia, Canada, South Africa and Newfoundland.So far as the question of the elimination of cargo other than essential commodities and war supplies for the United Kingdom and her Allies is concerned, the Ministry of Shipping feel that the policy indicated should be brought before the Imperial Conference as an urgent question requiring the early and serious.attention of the Governments of the Self Governing Dominions.     In this connection it is suggested that attention might be drawn to the recent list of commodities the import of which into the United Kingdom has been forbidden.     It should also be pointed out that in premising their co-operation, Australia have gone further than the other Self Governing Dominions, and have undertaken that the Commonwealth Government will support the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the cargoes to be carried for the national needs of the United. Kingdom.     It is suggested that the Dominions and India should be asked to agree formally to the principle that in the present emergency the primary consideration as to the cargoes to be loaded must be the needs of the importing allied countries in Europe.Further measures can, however, be taken to reduce the waste of tonnage space,  if the Self Governing Dominions would take steps, not only to limit their exports to the United Kingdom and her Allies, but also to reduce the importation into their Countries of non-essential commodities where this would result in a saving of tonnage.     This limitation would not l;PPly to exports from the United Kingdom or her Allies in Europe from which freight space will usually be available.
The elimination of non-essential imports into the Dominions from other sources than those mentioned might,  in appropiate cases, free a large amount of freight space, which could he diverted to more essential trades...,,... An.-- instance of this policy as regards South Africa may he-&apos;given.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently asked the Union Government to prohibit the importation of Motor Cafe, which occupied a large part of the tonnage between the United States and that Dominion, and that Government heave undertaken to bring in a Bill to give them the necessary power to do so.
Ill.    THE REDUCTION OF COASTAL SHIPPING.As already stated under II, the Self Governing Domin-ions and India have been asked to scrutinize their coastal shipping with a view to releasing ocean-going British steam-era engaged therein for the use of His Majesty&apos;s Government and her allies.   It has been suggested to them either that requirements could be reduced,  or that&apos; 3hipa now engaged could be replaced by. land transport&quot; or by&apos; neutral vessels,  and it has also been pointed out that many neutral owners would prefer to engage their ships in areas free,: from war- risk.The Shipping Controller would be glad if the Importance of this question to H.M. Government could be emphasised at the Conference.It might also be pointed out that there are a number of vessels employed in Dominion Patera probably suitable for Commissioned service as minelayers,  seaplane carriers,  of armed boarding steamers.    Their actual suitability however, cannot be judged without inspection.    It would be an assis-tance if detailed plans could be placed at the&apos; disposal of the Ministry of Shipping if it is thought that any of the ships might be released,   &quot;The allocation of some of the tugs no?/ employed in South African waters for work in submarine areas in assisting damaged ships would also be much appreci-ated.IV.   PRIZE AHD DETAIHED ENEMY VESSELS.The question of the control of these ships i3 one which has long been under the consideration of the Colonial Office, and it is unnecessary to dsai with the matter here, beyond referring to the fact that it is one in which the Controller&apos;3 Department is indirectly interested,  and on which an early decision is desirable.
C 0 P t.P.O. 3189Certified copy of a Report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 30th January 1917.The Conmmittee of the Privy Council have had before then a report, dated 27th November, 1916, from the Minister of Justice, representing that recently upon consideration of the correspon-dence and circumstances with regard to the requisitioning by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Canadian registered ship &quot;C.A. Jacques&quot; he advised the despatch of a cable message to the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the effect that Your Excellency&apos;s Government could not, in his opinion, acquiesce in the exercise as affecting Canadian vessels of the requisition-ing power by independent action of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or otherwise than by or through lour Sxcellency^ Government,Upon more deliberate consideration of the inatter, the Minister has reached the jo lloi/ing conclusions, but he observes that it is not the intention of this submission to question the prerogative or the extent of the prerogative which is for the present purposes assumed to exist, for the taking of ships of British subjects for the defence and protection of the realm, or that the power may be exercised although the place of registry, or the domicile or residence of the owners bgr not within the United Kingdom.   It is the manner of the exercise of the power rather than&apos; the assertion of the power i&amp;self which is in question.The Minister submits that in his ,view the question to be determined is not one of legal power but of constitutional right.     This distinction is well recognised in the Conventions which control the exercise of legislative powers.   Eor example, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the legal power but not the constitutional right to legislate directly in respect of Canadian affairs and in doing so to repeal pro tanto the British North America Acts.     It is submitted that the exercise of His Majesty1s prerogative with respect to Canada must be governed ty the like considerations.   It is the Parliament of Canada alone which constitutionally can determine and prescribe the &quot;burdens to be borne by this Dominion or by any of its citizens for the purpose,of this or any other war.     Similarly when the prerogative of the Crown is to be exercised, the Minister has ho doubt that in respect of all matters which involve a con-tribution by citizens domiciled in this country, this prerogative aust be exercised upon the advice of Your Excellency&apos;s Ministers and not upon the advice of the Government of the United Kingdom.It is assumed that this proposition will not be controverted is its application to the taking for purposes of defence of pro-perty, real or personal, situate within the Dominion;    and al-though ships constitute a species of property of transitory or shifting physical location, their owners nevertheless have Places of domicile and residence, and the property has a place of registry to one of which its locality should be referred; therefore the Minister apprehends that if a ship be registered and the owners be domiciled andreside
-2-reside within Canada, the compulsory displacing of the ownership or control of tho ship in favour cf the Crown for any public purpose should independently of the actual location at the time of the ship itself, he likewise a matter for the consideration and sanction of the Government of Canada through the means with which the Government is constitutionally endowed.The Minister submits, further, that the method of exercising the requisitioning power,.or the procedure by which the requisition is to be made effective, doos not depend upon solution of the legal Question, which may under existing instructions present some difficulty, as to whether Your Excellency is deputed to exercise this particular branch of the prerogative.     Necessary executive powers maybe delegated, or the exercise of the power may be sanctioned by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Governor General by means of his special legislative authority;   wherefore it seems that these powers effecting local inoeresfcs are not incapable of local execution and therefore that the compulsory requisition for the national service of Canadian owned and registered ships, in circumstances which admit of the competent exercise of the power, should bo effected by Your Leney upon the advice of Your Excellency^advisers;   and that independent action for this purpose on the part of His Majesty1s Government conflicts with the constitution-al autonomy of Canada in the present stage of its development.It is needless to observe that any representations which His Majesty&apos;s Government may submit as to the necessity or advisability of talcing over a Canadian ship for the purpose of the war will receive prompt and sympathetic consideration by Your Excellency1 s Ministers.The Committee concur in the foregoing, and on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that Your Excellency may be pleased to communicate v statement of the conclusions of the Minister of Justice as herein set out to the Secretary of State for the Colonies as indicating the views of your Excellency&apos;s Government as to the manner In which the War prerogative of His Majesty to take Canadian prcpert7/ for the purposes of national defence should constitutionally be exercised.All which, is respectfully submitted for approval.( Sd.)   EODOLPHE BOUDREAU.Clerk of the Privy Council.
