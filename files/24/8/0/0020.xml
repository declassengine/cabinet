POTATOES FOR SCOTLAND.It cannot be too strongly urged that the main reason for pressing this matter is that there is practically potato famine in Scotland already because, (1) the 1916 crop in that country has failed in a degree beyond comparison greater than in England or Ireland, and (2) over and above the bad harvest the necessary action of the Food Controller in regard to seed potatoes has practically turned all Scottish potatoes into seed potatoes, to the great benefit of England, but the further prejudice of Scotland. The case is therefore quite special to Scotland.In reply to a reauest for information up to date the following telegrams were received on Saturday and yesterday from the four largest Scottish towns:-Glasgow:Local situation is practically no potatoes for home consump--tion, all Scotch supplies being^reserved for seed purposes.    Our City&apos;s average normal requirements are  ,000 tons per week.    The actual supplies available are confined to a few waggons from England each day or alternate days.EdinburghPresident Local Association informs me that average normal potato requirements are 600 tons weekly.    Present available supplies about 20 tons. Aberdeen:Supply has practically been exhausted for last 10 days. Average normal requirements between 300 and 400 tons per week.    Actual supplies available do not exceed a few tons. Dundee:About 200 tons per week approximate normal requirements. Impossible give available supplies without returns from farmers and dealer in district. - SThe following telegram was deceived this morning from the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, Glasgow:&quot;Potato position in Scotland worse than ever.    We are afraid there is going to be a serious shortage of seed also&quot;.Glasgow Potato Trade Association writing on Saturday say:-&quot;Shortage of eating potatoes is now greater than ever, Oiir remaining Scotch crop is practically all reserved for seed, the bulk or which is going to England.    There is nothing coming, from Ireland from England we get only a few waggons at intervals^&apos;.It is in view of the above facts that the suggestion has been made that the Home Army should, to some extent, share the shortage or the civil population.Scottish Office, 19th March, 1917.
