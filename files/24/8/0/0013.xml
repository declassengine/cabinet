SACHET-- .   WAR   CABINETG.T. 213TRANSPORT WORKERS&apos; BATTALION SCHEME(Letter from Shipping Xontroiler to the SecretaryWar Cabinet..)MINISTRY OP SHIPPING-,St. James 1 s Park., S-.W-.17th March, 1917Pear Colonel Hankoy,I have received.the War Cabinet 96, Minute.6,  suspending the decision of War Cabinet 95, Minute&apos;4 giving, priority to the demands of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion on the men at the disposal of the Secretary of State for War, and I think the matter is so important that I must press for an immediate reconsideration.The whole point of the Transport Workers&apos;&apos; Battalion scheme is that there shall be a sufficient reserve cf men under military discipline to meet any demands which may arise at the ports and the fact that at any particular moment all the men are not actually employei at the ports is no reason why efforts to bring the Battalion up to its full strength should be relaxed.While the men are not employed they are receiving military training and are at the complete disposal cf the War Office for any emergency.The tonnage situation is so serious that every effort must be made to speed up work at the docks and on the rail-ways and this cannot be done effectively until adequate-arrangements are made-for the Transport WorkersT Battalion. You understand that the men are kept at a number of different centres throughout the country and not in one body.I should be glad if you would bring the matter before -the War Cabinet without delay to get Minute 4 of 95 Confirmed.Yours very truly,(Signed)&apos;  J\P. MACLAY.
