The Pood Controller, after consultation with the Agricultural Departments and representatives of the interests concerned, decided to let the existing Price of Milk Order remain in force through the summer.     This means that farmers will be able, during the summer, to get the same excess over their pre-y/ar summer prices as during the past winter they have been getting over their pre-war winter prices,     As the cost of summer feeding cannot have risen in anything like the same proportion as the cost of 7finter feeding, the maintenance of the same sum as an excess in price ftrima facie needs justification.     It appeared evident that the excess allowed for the winter of 1915-16 was in some cases inadequate owing to continued rise in the cost of production, and the continuance of the same margins over pre-war prices was partly intended- to make good deficiencies cf price during the winter.It has been strongly urged that an Immediate announcement is necessary to reassure dairy farmers that the prices fixed for raj Ik next winter will not be unremunerative, and the Food Controller is consulting with Mr, Prothero as to the terms of such an announcement.     To. prevent the risk of depletion cf the milking herds action of this kind is required, but It must be pointed out that any material increase in the &quot;War margin&quot; to the producers will involve a rise in the price of milk to the consumers.Ministry of Pood,17th March 1917.
