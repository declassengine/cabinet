The Directors of the Press Bureau will be greatly obliged if they may be informed whenever a Secretary of State, Under-Seoretary or High Official of a Government Department, gives to any member of the British or Foreign Press an interview for publication.Early information of any such interview will save much time and trouble, and will make it unnecessary to refer to Departments late at night while the report of the interview is being delayed until confirmation is received..(2)     The Directors take this opportunity to mention that while every endeavour is made to censor matter the publication of which would constitute a breach of the Regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act, it would be of great assistance if Government Departments would give to the Press Bureau timely warning of any new subject the public discussion of which is undesirable either in the interests of the Empire or of any of the Allies.     Without such warning there is always a risk that, with the large number of telegraphic messages and newspaper articles passing through the Press Bureau, both day and night, dealt with by many different hands, something may be passed whioh will do harm to the Allied cause, offend the susceptibilities or damage the interests of one or other of our Allies.OFFICIAL PRESS BUREAU. -Whitehall, S.W.18th July 191$..
