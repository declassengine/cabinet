copy.WAR CABINET.OPERATIONS.From:-   General Hanbury Williams. To:-      C.I.G.S.    repeated Ambassador.23.3.17.tf.R.880.Anbassador has repeated his telegram to Foreign Office to me. Matter is now past history but it should be borne in mind that Petrograd and this place are under different conditions. There were grave fears in regard to Emperor&apos;s plans.   Plans have to be made and decisions come to quickly.   As to these we act throughout in conjunction with Alexieff.   My reasons for proposing to accompany Emperor were similar to those represented by Buchanan in regard in regard to Grand Duchess Victoria.   Emperor is near relation to His Majesty;   we have been his guests for over a year and have received much kind-ness from him.   We decided not to go as soon as we heard of Government&apos;s guarantee of safety to Emperor.     As to my pro-posal re Grand Dukes it was only sent to inform you of my action as I continue to do, and I accepted his decision at once.     Speaking personally and privately I consider the condition regarding Emperor&apos;s going to United Kingdom unfair and an insult to him.
