(llote by tho Ministry of Pood)The Report of the Ministry of Hood for the week ending Uodnesday, March 14, contains statistics as to whole-sale&apos;and retain pi ices compared with the previous month and with a year ago.It may be of interest to odd to this information material for reviewing the -general course of retell prices sinoe the outbreak of vxi,     This is afforded by tho attached Table 1 showing the increase of prices at sis-monthly intervale and at the beginning of January, ^obrupry and March, 1917, expressed in every case as c percentage of the normal &quot;orice in July, 1914.It v,ill be seen that on an ever age retell prices at March 1st, 1917, were 92$  hove the prices in July, 1914. The rrtides which have risen most are sugar (171 per cent) frozen mutton (breast) (147 per cent.) chilled or frozen Boef (thin flank) (124 per cent.) fish (122 per cent.) eggs (118 per cent.) and potatoes (110 per cent)     Those which havo risen least are margarine (36 per cent.) tea (50 per cent.) end milk (60..per cent.).   L&amp; is noted below, margarine and tea are among the articles which within the lest month have shown the most repid increase.The rate of increase from month to month h&amp;s naturally varied, but talcing six monthly periods together, has been fairly steady.The average rate of increase per month expressed as a percentage cf the prices at 1914 has been as follows :-July /Dec emb er, 1914 .....,.3.0Jan./June, 1915 .... ,.2.4July/December, 1915 .......2.1Jan./June, 1916 ...........2.6July/Dec ember, 1916 ..2.7January, 1917 ...____........2.0February, 1917-.........  , .3.3The average over the whole period is 2.6,.     Tho actual rate of increase in January is thus below the/iverage, and that in February considerably above the average.     This is the more noticeable because in previous Jebruaries (owing no doubt to seasonal causes) the rate of increase has been below the average.     The increase of 3.3 for February, 1917, compares with 1.5 for February, 1916-This relates to ell the principal foodstuffs taken together.     Particular articles during-&apos;the last two months have, naturally shown rates of increase much above the average, the highest in February being cheese (19^ of July, 1914, prices) frozen mutton (breast) (13.1;:) bacon (12.70J margarine (6.9$ ) tea (6.1$).Much the most marked recent increases in food prices, however, have taken place not in regard to tho principal foods included in the table, but in regard to subsidiary foods such as beans, lentils, peas, oatmeal, rice, sago and tapioca.     This is strikingly shown in the attached
Table II.      During the 30 months from July, 1914, to December, 1916, the prices of these subsidiary foods increased on an average at about the same rate as the principal foods (2.0 as compared with 2.6).     In January they jumped by 10.9$ of the pre-war price (as compared with 2.0 for the principal foods) and in February by 31.4$ (as compared with 3.3$). Since March 1st. they are known in many cases to have&apos; continued to rise rapidly.     This rise is no doubt due partly to-restriction of imports, and partly to increased demand for the subsidiary articles as substitutes for meat, wheat and potatoes.Ministry of Food,.17 th..
