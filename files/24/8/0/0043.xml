In view of Russian troops impending arrival at Khanikin, it is advisable that units of our respective spheres of influence should be defined. I suggest that line of demarcation should run from Bedrah through Mendali and Zizil Robat along Jebal Hamrin Hills to Shoreimeh on Tigris. All above-mentioned places to be exclusive for ourselves, inclusive for Russia.
