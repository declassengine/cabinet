For information of Imperial War Cabinet   March 1917.SEOKET.A  GENERAL   REVIEW  OE  THE NATAL  SITUATION.^i.-^ :--r:&apos;i &quot;Admiralty,Marcfe 24, 1917.
SECRET.REVIEW OF THE NAVAL SITUATION.THE most important factor in the naval situation at present is undoubtedly tho war on shipping which is being carried out by the Central Powers, and it will therefore be dealt with first.On the success or failure of this method of attack will depend the capacity of the Allies to continue the war. It is, therefore, not possible to over-estimate the seriousness of the view which should be taken of this attempt on the part of the Central Powers to defeat us.It is, of course, the case that the war against shipping has been carried out by-German and Austrian submarines ever since the early part of 1915, but it was only towards the end of last year that the position became really grave, and with the declaration of a blockade of the allied coasts on the 1st February last the German submarine campaign assumed a more serious phase.Up to that date sinking ships without warning, at any rate in home waters, had been rather the exception than the rule. That this was not due to any feelings of humanity, but solely to the fear of American intervention, should any regrettable incident occur resulting in the loss of American lives, was clearly evident from the fact that in the Mediterranean, where British and Allied trade was confined to a fixed route, distinct from the usual traffic routes, sinking at sight was the general custom. These British vessels, however, were almost invariably defensively armed.Since the 1st February, sinking by torpedo without warning has become the general practice unless the ship is either a neutral or there is reason to. believe that she is unarmed, in which cases the vessel is sunk by gunfire and bombs. The arming of merchant ships (we have now upwards of 2,000 carrying a gun) is no doubt mainly the cause of the increasing use of the torpedo. In one respect this is advantageous, as a submarine can only carry a limited supply of. torpedoes, but, on the other hand, there is no counter to the torpedo- used by the submarine in the same way as there is to the gun used by the same vessel.The &quot;blockade&quot; has now been in operation for some weeks, and the exjjerience gained of its effect is sufficient to demonstrate the serious nature of the menace.It may fairly be assumed that the initial effort made by the enemy on the decla-ration of the blockade represented the maximum effort possible at the time; but unfortunately we cannot conclude from this that our average losses in tonnage during the past six weeks represent the maximum likely to be experienced.Even if we could rely on the average number of enemy submarines operating during the next six months as not appreciably exceeding that of last month, it must he recognised that, with the advent of longer days and finer weather, the offensive capacity of the submarine will greatly increase.As a matter of fact, we are faced with the certainty of an increase month by month in the number of hostile submarines. During 1916 it is believed that the Germans produced an average of nearly two submarines a week, while during 1917 the average output is expected to increase, unless the general mobilisation in Germany affects the rate of construction.It is evident, therefore, that we must be prepared for the menace assuming a still more acute stage, unless we are able to sink many more enemy submarines than is at present the case.Against this certain increase of activity we may put a growing increase in our anti-submarine resources and the adoption of new methods of combating the menace, together with improved efficiency on the part of the mercantile marine in applying the various means at their disposal for evading and warding off attack. But theintro-duction of new measures and the use of additional resources cannot be relied on to affect the situation during the next two or three months, and in the meantime we must be prepared for greater losses in tonnage than we have yet experienced.The folloAving table shows the total losses of merchant ships from enemy submarines and mines during Februarv, as compared with the average losses for each [433]
month from October 1916 to January 1917. The figures are given separately for British, Allied, and neutral:-Type of Vessel.&apos;	Losses during February 1917.		, Average Losses per Month from October 1916 to January &apos;.&quot; -   1917.

Grand total	249	493,774	. 178	333,614As regards probable -losses in the near future, a not unreasonable estimate is considered to be 500,000 tons (allied and neutral) during March, increasing possibly to 700,000 tons in June. Prom that month onwards some amelioration of the situation may be expected.: In these estimates losses which may be caused by raiders now at sea, or which may in future break out, are not included.The menace from mines laid by submarines has also become more acute since the declaration of the blockade. The Germans possess upwards of eighty submarines fitted for mine-laying, some of which carry as many as thirty-six mines in addition to a gun and torpedo armament. The mines are laid in small groups in carefully-selected positions on routes along which traffic is seen to be passing, and against this form of attack no system of mine-sweeping within our present resources ,can afford effective protection.Steps have, however, been taken to provide merchant ships with a means of defence against this danger, and it is. anticipated that when so fitted they will be largely immune, provided it is found possible to ensure a correct use of the defence. There is, however, little probability of any appreciable number of cargo ships being fitted with, this device before July of this year or even later.The question which has to be decided is the extent to which the shipping losses will affect the capacity of the Allies to continue the war. This subject is being investigated by a Committee presided over by the First Lord of the Admiralty, and involves a close examination of the amount of food, munitions, stores, and raw material which, it is necessary to import into each of the Allied countries. The examination of the figures is not yet completed, but it has become perfectly clear to the Committee that witkout very drastic changes in policy the shipping available is totally insufficient to carry out our requirements. For instance, it is estimated that in the period from April to August (inclusive) of this year there will only be available from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the total shipping tonnage required to carry the food and other imports necessary for civilian requirements and for munitions. This does not take into account the tonnage required for the import of the 2,000,000 tons of wheat which is wanted by the Food Controller to build up a reserve. It is known that the store of wheat is very low (at the end of July it will only be six or seven weeks), and that the reserve of stores and food for our armies abroad is measured by days and not by weeks. It is impossible to over-estimate the gravity of the situation under these conditions. The position is rendered still more critical by the inadequacy of our shipping resources for the supply of &quot;coal to France and Italy up to the amounts required.Having dealt with the submarine question, it may be of interest to state shortly the naval policy in the North Sea.The strategical idea governing the employment of the Grand Fleet at this period of the war is the maintenance of the blockade of Germany and the defence of this country against invasion.Until the German High Sea Fleet is completely defeated, the menace of invasion must always remain. The main portion of the Grand Fleet is still based in the far north, whilst the battle cruiser force is based further south.   This separation of the
two portions of the fleet has manifest - disadvantages, and the distance of the main portion of the Grand Fleet from the locality in which a German invading force might land makes it very- difficult for the Admiralty to guarantee that the operation of disembarking such a force shall be effectively interrupted until a considerable period has elapsed from the time when it is sighted.Unfortunately we have no harbour on the East coast in which it is possible to base the whole of the&apos; Grand Fleet. Efforts have been made for many months now to prepare a harbour for this purpose, but nothing that can be done during the war will ever make it possible for the whole of the Grand Fleet to be accommodated at any port other than the one in the far north.The danger of invasion has therefore to be faced and the necessary steps taken to meet it, should it occur.Some interruption to a landing from our light forces in southern waters avouIcI undoubtedly occur, but it is not possible to guarantee that such interruption would be sufficient to interfere seriously with a landing.It is obvious that if a landing cannot be seriously interrupted, it is quite impossible to prevent spasmodic raiding bombardments on our south-eastern and eastern coasts. Tlie German ports are within 230 miles of our coast, and fast ships leaving at dusk at this time of the year can arrive off our coast at daylight for bombardment purposes wdthout any fear of interruption by superior forces. If we keep weak patrols out there is nothing to prevent them from being annihilated by superior enemy forces; it is impossible to keep strong patrols out owing to the distance of our fleets from the locality, in addition to which our heavy ships would, if utilised for work of this nature in southern waters, run the most serious risks from mines and submarines.The occupation and fortification of Zeebrugge and Ostend by the Germans has greatly added to the difficulties of the Navy. These ports, on which a large number of submarines and destroyers are based, are a constant menace to our cross-channel communications and to our south-eastern coasts. Their fortifications are very strong and they are quite invulnerable to purely naval attack. The canal system of Belgium makes it possible for the destroyers and submarines when not in use to be kept well inland at Bruges, where no form of attack, except air raids, can possibly reach them. Any further advance of the German armies along the North Coast of France would be fatal to our cross-channel communications.From the foregoing it will be seen that in southern waters the Germans are greatly superior in naval force to ourselves, and that the command of the southern part of the North Sea cannot be assured. The matter is very different north of the latitude of the Horn Hcef. FVom this position our mastery of the sea, not only in home waters but all over the world, is assured so far as surface ships are concerned, except for the presence of one or two spasmodic raiders, whose activities are limited.Meanwhile the Grand Fleet covers the blockading force, and the only way in which the German surface vessels can stop the blockade is by engaging and defeating that fleet.
THE; WORK OF THE NAVY.Before entering into details of the operations of our naval forces, it will be advisable to give a general summary of the distribution between the various Allied Powers of the necessary naval operations throughout the world areaWestern European Waters.North Sea. This area is entirely under the control of the British Navy, and no Allied vessels operate therein. The main strength of our Navy is concentrated so as to command these waters.English Channel. The British Navy is primarily responsible for the Channel, where the work consists principally in safeguarding the communications with the continent, protecting shipping from attack, and defence against chance raids from enemy light craft which are always possible so long as tlie enemy can maintain bases on the Belgian coast. In this wrork some assistance is given by light vessels of the Prench Navy, which operate on their own coast.Atlantic Coast of Great Britain to Iceland and Norway. These waters are guarded entirely by the British Navy, the principal operations being the outer blockade of the North Sea, both military and commercial, the protection of commerce against submarines and raiders, and general&apos;offensive against submarines.White Sea. The naval forces employed for the protection of the Russian northern ports are very largely provided by the British Navy, since it is not possible for the llussian Navy to get ships into these waters. It is vital to keep these,&apos;the only European ports of Russia which are free to communication with the outside world, always open to commerce, and considerable trouble has been experienced from enemy submarines and mine-laying.Baltic, The naval operations in the Baltic are in the hands of the Russian Navy, but we have passed in a number of our submarines, which are now permanently attached to the Russian forces. &apos;Bay of Biscay. Any necessary coastal work is carried out by the French Navy, but. all. escort of transports, munition and supply ships from the mouth of the Channel, both outward and homeward bound, and as may be necessary on to Gibraltar, is provided by the British Navy.Gibraltar. The defence of the Straits and the arrangements for the control of commerce are entirely in the hands of the British Navy. The French Morocco Division is based on Gibraltar and operates on the Morocco coast and to the westward of Cape Spartel.Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf. &apos; 1Adriatic. The naval forces for operations in the Adriatic against the Austrian Fleet are primarily provided by the Italian and French Navies, but attached to them is a considerable British Adriatic squadron of cruisers and light warships, and a great number of patrol craft of various kinds.Mgean. The squadrons in tho iEgean Sea are principally British, but consider-able assistance is also given by the French Navy. Their sphered operation extends from Greece, round the coasts of Macedonia and Asia Minor to Syria, and their work includes the duty of protection of the transport and supply ;of the expeditions at Salonica.Egypt. The naval fcr.es on the Egyptian coast are entirely British.General. The naval forces outside the above spheres, with the exception of the British flotiilas based on Malta, are provided by the French Navy. But the vast majority of the small craft used for patrol, auxiliary, and escort purposes throughout the whole Mediterranean are provided by Great Britain. ;      -Peel Sea, Persian Gulf, and Mesopotamia. The naval forces employed in these waters, including those attached to the Mesopotamia expedition, are mainly British. Three French warships operate from Jibuti. &quot; a
Extra-European Waters.North America and West Indies. the british squadron is assisted by a french cruiser squadron.Eastern North Atlantic and South Atlantic-and East Coast of South America.  these british squadrons are assisted by a french squadron of cruisers based on Dakar.Cape of Good Hope.East Coast of Africa.East Indies.Australia.Pacific.these are entirely british squadrons.: China Seas, Indian Ocean, and the Western Pacific. the principal forces in these waters, are provided by the japanese navy, assisted by a squadron from the british and royal australian navies.from the foregoing brief summary it will be seen how largely the burden of the naval side of the war devolves upon the british empire. &quot;when it is considered that in addition to ships for fighting and operations of a military nature, the admiralty also provides and controls all the vessels for the transport, supply, and maintenance of the expeditionary forces in france, salonica, egypt, mesopotamia, and the east coast of africa, for the supply of the various squadrons distributed over the world, and to a large extent for the transportation of munitions and necessary supplies to france, italy, and russia, some idea will be obtained of the immense organisation that is necessary.british naval force in home waters.coming now to a more detailed description of the distribution and employment of the naval forces of the empire, it will be interesting to show first the present strength of pur grand fleet, apart from submarines, auxiliary and subsidiary vessels, as it is composed at the present time and as it is anticipated to be a year hence, and to give similar statistics for the german high sea fleet so far as available: british  grand fleet.1 March 1917.  1 j ..                                .........

As regards destroyers of which 115 are at present attached directly to the Grand Fleet no exact information is available as to the German resources, but it is known that the present position is also secure. Nevertheless the ever-increasing demands for this class of ship for work in connexion with the submarine menace, escort, and patrol duties, &amp;c, only enables the minimum requirements of the Grand Fleet to be met at the expense of other most important services.Although for fighting purposes, apart from anti-submarine work, the position as regards cruisers and destroyers is satisfactory, the fact that the German Navy has a number of efficient rigid airships of large radius of action, whereas as yet we have none, places us at a considerable disadvantage so far as the scouting and look-out units of the Grand Fleet are concerned. One airship can more efficiently do the work of very many cruisers in this respect in suitable weather, and (remain practically immune from attack. Consequently, unless in thick weather or just at daylight, it is very improbable that we shall ever be able to effect a surprise attack on any important section of the High Sea Fleet. . . &apos; -Reference has previously been made to the auxiliary vessels employed with the Grand Fleet, and it is not necessary to enter into anjr exact details regarding these vessels, but they comprise such different types as seaplane carriers, kite balloon ships, fleet sweepers, minelayers, &amp;c, in addition to the ordinary services of dep6t ships, repair ships, colliers, supply and ammunition ships, hospital ships, &amp;c. Many of these types have been evolved during the war. .In addition to the ships of the Grand Fleet there are employed round our coasts, largely on anti-submarine work, a very great number of small craft of all descriptions, as will be seen from the detailed lists given below. List (A) gives the ships employed on protection of shipping against submarines and mines in the vicinity of our coasts, and List (B) those engaged on offensive operations against submarines. It is difficult, however, to lay down a hard and fast line as to whether a vessel is employed, defensively or offensively. For example, an armed patrol trawler, though primarily employed defensively, beumes at once an offensive unit on sighting an enemy submarine.List (A.)

Further particulars of this service are given later.BRITISH NAVAL FORCES AND OPERATIONS ABROAD.Fuller particulars of the British naval forces employed away from home waters-and the duties which they perform are as follows : Mediterranean.: The Commander-in-Chief of the French Fleet is in general command of operations against the Austrian Fleet outside the Adriatic, but the Vice-Admiral commanding the British Eastern Mediterranean Squadron is in charge of all operations in the iEgean Sea, which include the blockade of the Dardanelles, the coasts of Asia Minor, Turkey in Europe, Bulgaria, and Greece.Besides these blockades the work, consists of carrying out operations in co-opera-tion with the Allied Land Forces in Macedonia, in the protection and escort of the transports and shipping passing to and from Salonica, against submarines, and against attacks from the Turkish vessels, from Constantinople, and in minesweeping. There is also a considerable amouut of work in connexion with the administration of islands under the Provisional Government of Salonica, and of the various harbours used as bases and harbours of refuge. In the event of the Austrian Fleet coming out, the British ships would work in co-operation with the French and Italian Navies in bringing them to action.The squadron under the Vice-Admiral&apos;s orders comprises3 battleships,3 cruisers,5 light cruisers,2 large monitors, 10 small monitors,3 miuelavers, 29 destroyers,6 torpedo-boats,4 submarines,8 sloops,6 armed boarding steamers, 2 seaplane carriers,and a large number of minesweepers, armed trawlers, and net drifters.:, . The Senior Naval Officer at Malta controls the forces employed in the escort of transports and patrol of the trade routes in,a zone in the Central Mediterranean south of Sicily, between the Islands of Pantellaria and Crete, and he has at his disposal: C 4* destroyers,I : iff.; 11. sloops,and a large number of armed trawlers.and minesweepers.The Rear-Admiral, British   Adriatic Squadi*on, is under the orders of the Gbmmander-in-Chief of the Italian Fleet at Taranto, for operations against the [433] - D
East Indies.The Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, is responsible for the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, including Mesopotamia, the Red Sea, Egypt, and a portion of the Mediterranean Sea south and east of Crete, but excluding Cyprus and &quot;the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor.The forces under his command are at the present moment disposed as follows :-Indian &quot;Waters or on passage 1 battleship. 1 cruiser. .4 light cruisers.1 armed boarding.steamer. 1 seaplane carrier.Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia 2 light cruisers, 3 gun-boats.2 armed merchant cruisers, R.I.M. lb&apos; river gun-boats.Red Sea 1 light cruiser. 3 gun-boats.4 armed merchant cruisers, R.I.M. 2 armed boarding steamers.Egypt-5 small monitors.2 gun-boats.4 river gun-boats.Mediterranean 11 sloops.1 seaplane carrier. .48 armed trawlers.The work consists in patrolling focal points of the trade routes, escort of troop-ships, blockade of the coasts of Arabia, patrol of the Somaliland coast, Red Sea, and the north coast of Egypt, and patrol of routes in the Mediterranean for protection of shipping against submarines. The operations in the Red Sea and Mesopotamia consist in the protection of the lines of communication of the Expeditionary Force, as well as active operations against the Turkish forces. Four of the river gun-boats are with the advanced troops on the River Tigris, north of Bagdad.Attention has already been called to the fact that the great proportion of the auxiliaries and small craft used in the Mediterranean are provided by this country.\ At Venice,Austrian Fleet, and for the barrage&apos; across the Straits of Otranto intended to prevent the passage of submarines through them.   His squadron includes : 4 light cruisers, 2 monitors r&quot; 3 submarines4&apos;destroyers,and a larg  number of net-drifters and motor-launches.A British Seaplane Station is being established at Otranto.Gibraltar. The ships based on Gibraltar are as follows : 10 torpe,do-bpats, - 5 sloops, &apos;4 armed boarding steamers, 1&apos; submarine,and also a squadron of fast armed yachts.
This is shown by the following summary of such vessels we have serving in the Mediterranean:  .     -:     , ,     :8 yachts. 178 trawlers and drifters, 94 motor-launches. :    TO patrbl-paddlers. &quot; .- 2 motor-boats.163 net-drifters. 4 boom defence.China and the Far Fast.The Commander-in-Chief, China, with headquarters at Singapore, is responsible for the Bay of Bengal, Dutch East Indies, and China Seas, and has at his disposal: 3 cruisers,3 sloops, V Of the lloyal Navy.1 armed merchant cruiser, J     , ,3 destroyers of the lloyal Australian Navy.In addition to these, two cruisers and four destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, under a Bear-Admiral, are stationed in the Malacca Straits. These ships act under the orders of their own Admiral, who carries out operations at the request of the British Commanderdn-Chief.The Commodore at Hong Kong has two destroyers and a torpedo-boat for any minor operations required in the vicinity, but major operations in the China Seas are conducted by the Japanese Navy.The work carried out consists in patrolling the approaches to Ceylon, the Straits of Malacca, and Sunda Strait in view of the presence of an armed raider in the Indian Ocean. Included in this is the boarding and examinatfon of all merchant ships and mails, with the special object of stopping propaganda against the British Raj in India, in addition to seeking for contraband or enemy persons.Australia.There are now only one cruiser and three destroyers in Australian waters; the cruiser &quot;Encounter &quot; being in Western Australia where she is in a position to pursue the raider if she appears in those waters.Gape Station,The squadron consists of :  -1 cruiser.6 light cruisers.2 monitors.2 armed merchant cruisers.3 gunboats.8 armed whalers.The principal work of this squadron consists in the blockade of the coast of German East Africa south of Dar-es-Salaam, and in operations against the German forces in co-operation with the military. The other duties consist in tbe protection of the trade routes converging on the Cape in the South Indian Ocean and South Atlantic, in guarding against German armed raiders visiting the Cameroons or other places on the West Coast of Africa, and in escorting troopships.Siih Cruiser Squadron. .This squadron, under a Rear-Admiral, is based at Sierra Leone, and carries out the work of escorting troopships between the Cape and England, besides operating against German raiders in the South Atlantic and the eastern part of the North Atlantic. It consists of:--2 battleships. 4 cruisers.2 armed merchant cruisers.

It is not generally known how large a number of these interned merchant steamers there are, and the following summary will be of interest:  J * .Brazilian ports           ...         ...         .......	aaa                      a * a                      a * a       4 SArgentine ports	...         ...   18Chilian ports ...	aaa                         aaa                         a a a        32Peruvian ports          .......

The areas to be covered by each ship are enormous, as will be seen below, and the squadrons abroad also consist of all our oldest cruisers, which are naturally not so reliable as steamers for the immense distances involved.Atlantic. - rTwo squadrons are stationed in the North Atlantic the North America and West Indies Squadron,- based on Halifax and Bermuda, and the Ninth Cruiser Squadron, based on Sierra Leone. The former consists of 7 cruisers, 1 light cruiser, and 1 armed merchant cruiser; the latter of 2 pre-Dreadnought battleships, 3 cruisers, 1 light cruiser, and 2 armed merchant cruisers.
In the South Atlantic, 2 light cruisers and 4 armed merchant-cruisers are stationed on the East Coast of South America, 2 old light cruisers on the. West Coast of Africa, while 1 cruiser is employed on escort duties with transports between the Cape of Good Hope and Sierra Leone. ; ; ..Omitting the 2 slow vessels on the West Coast, there is a total force of 25 vessels in the Atlantic. Of this total a certain number is always engaged in convoying troop transports (including vessels carrying labour battalions) from the Cape to the United Kingdom, from Canada to the United Kingdom, and from the United Kingdom to the Cape; in carrying bullion from the Cape and the United Kingdom to Canada; and in refitting in home and colonial dockyards (5 vessels are now in dockyard hands).The French also maintain a squadron in the West Indies based on Fort de France, and one on the West Coast of Africa based on Dakar. The former now consists of four cruisers and one light cruiaer, the latter of two cruisers and one light cruiser, giving a total of eight French vessels. These squadrons work in close com-muuication with .tbe British Admirals in command, of the North America and West Indies and the 9th Cruiser Squadrons.Therefore there are in the Atlantic, Without making any deduction for vessels under repair, a total of thirty-three Allied cruisers available for protection against raiders in the 31,500,000 square miles which that ocean covers.Indian Ocean.At the Cape of Good Hope is stationed a squadron of six light cruisers and two armed merchant cruisers, together with a number of small vessels for blockade duties on the East Coast of Africa. One of the cruisers is always within reach of Simons-town or Durban, the remainder are employed off the coast of German East Africa. The force at the Cape is about to be increased by two Japanese light cruisers, which are at present detained at Colombo on account of the situation in those waters.In the Bed Sea is a force of one light cruiser, four armed Indian marine vessels, and two small armed merchant cruisers. These seven vessels, with two sloops, patrol the 178,000 square miles of sea, and assist in the operations on the Arabian coast.The force in Indian waters consists of one pre-Dread nought battleship, one cruiser, live light cruisers, and some small vessels, under the command of the Com-mander-in-Chief, East Indies, and, in the Bay of Bengal, of two light cruisers, and one armed merchant cruiser under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, China. There are also at present four Japanese light cruisers, of which two are eventually to proceed to the Cape, while the others are based on Singapore.There are, therefore, in the Indian Ocean, omitting Japanese vessels (which are not permanently stationed there) : Cape Squadron ... ... ... ... ...    8 *East Indies    ... ... ... ... ... ...    7China . ... ... ...   .     ... .       ... ...    3Total     ... ... ... ... ...   18Eighteen vessels for 28,350,000 square miles.China Seas.There remain in the China Squadron, in addition to the foregoing, one light cruiser .and several small cratt. The two Japanese light cruisers referred to above are based on Singapore, as well as four Japanese destroyers, which assist in the patrol of the Malacca Straits. Three Australian destroyers are also employed in the Straits.The Japanese have hitherto maintained a squadron in the South China Seas mainly for watching Manila.   They have been requested to station a squadron in the neighbourhood of Hong Kong and another on the coast of Queensland.    These precautions are being taken in case the raider now in eastern waters proceeds to operate against trade in Australian or New Zealand waters.THE NORTHERN BLOCKADE.It will be of interest to give Here some particulars of the methods by which the northern entrance to the North Sea is patrolled and the blockade of German parts from the open ocean rendered effective.[433J E
The attached Table shows briefly in statistical form the work which has been carried out by the Northern Patrol since the introduction of the Reprisals Order in Council of March 1915, wherein it was announced that all goods of enemy ownership, origin, or destination would be stopped by the Allies.-: There are two channels by which goods may enter Germany through the Northern Countries, viz., through the Straits of Dover, and round the North of Scotland.Early in the war a large minefield was laid by Great Britain across the Straits of Dover, thus compelling all vessels proceeding to Holland or Scandinavia through the English Channel to pass through the Downs. By this means it has been possible to intercept and examine every ship without exception which has passed up or down the English Channel on its wav to or from Holland or Scandinavia,As regards the route round the north of Scotland, however, the case is entirely different. The distance from the north of Scotland to Iceland is 450 miles, and from Iceland to Greenland 160 miles. When vessels have passed this line they are able to make the coast of Norway, and thence keep in territorial waters to their destination. From this it will be seen that the problem [set to the Northern Patrol is to watch a line of a maximum length of 610 miles, this length being somewhat reduced in the winter, due to ice.This has imposed an extremely arduous task on the watching squadrons. Vessels are able to choose their own time and place when and where they will attempt to cross this line, and to frustrate them involves a constant and unremitting watch night and day. During the winter months gales are incessant, and follow one another with almost monotonous regularity. During both the winter and summer months enemy submarines are constantly searching for and endeavouring to sink the ships maintain-in g the blockade.Every vessel met is stopped and boarded, frequently in strong gales of wind. Boat work under such circumstances is both difficult and dangerous, while the risks to the ship of being torpedoed by a lurking submarine when stopped to lower or pick up her boat are very great. The skilful services of the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve men have been of the greatest value in this boat work. The strain all this work imposes on the personnel of the officers and men needs no comment. The very large majority of the officers and crews of these ships are men who prior to the war were serving in the Mercantile Marine, and to.whom this work is therefore quite apart from their life training.In addition to maintaining the blockade with a view to intercepting German commerce, the watching squadrons are constantly on the look-out for enemy raiders, which may try to break out into the Atlantic to prey on British commerce. The cruisers have to work many miles from their bases, a long way out of sight of one another, and. are often at sea for periods considerably exceeding a month.How increasingly efficient this blockade has been the accompanying table clearly shows, for whereas at the commencement of the blockade an average of sixtv-four vessels passed through the patrols per month unobserved, this number during the last six months of 1916 has been reduced to an average of ten per month.The presence of the blockading squadron and its admitted efficiency, combined with the pressure that we have been able to exert on neutral shipping lines by the withholding of bunker coal from vessels which do not&apos;comply with our conditions, have made it possible for the Foreign Office to conclude a series of Agreements with several of the neutral lines of steamers trading to and from Scandinavia and Holland, whereby these vessels call voluntarily at Kirk wall. This, in its turn, has assisted the patrols in their work by decreasing the number of vessels which it has been found necessary to send into Kirkwall with armed guards.It may, therefore, be fairly claimed that no blockade in history has ever been so effective from a naval point of view7, or so full of unexpected dangers.

At these stations special machines of high capabilities are always in constant readiness to repel raids aimed at London or other important objectives. It is the function of Naval machines to encounter and drive off the enemy before he reaches the coast, such enemy machines as may succeed in crossing the coast being dealt with by the Military forces until they again re-cross the coast-line.The Straits of Dover and the Belgian Coast.The Navy maintains a large establishment of aircraft, consisting of three Wings of land machines and a number of seaplanes at Dunkirk, in convenient proximity to the enemy force in the district, extending from Nieuport to the Dutch frontier. The primary work of this force is Naval reconnaissance; constant observation is kept on the movements of German ships, submarines, and. other craft in Ostend, Zeebrugge, and the adjacent canals.Attacks are carried out by bombing machines on these places at frequent intervals, with a view to damaging and destroying the enemy&apos;s shipping and works to the greatest extent possible. These operations are actively opposed by the enemy, and in consequence a high percentage of the Dunkirk machines are fighters which accompany the reconnaissance and bombing machines, and maintain a practically continuous fighting patrol at the end of the Western front.Encounters with the enemy are of frequent occurrence, and a considerable number of enemy machines have been destroyed by our forces. It is noteworthy that the position of this important force has a very important bearing on the possibility of large daylight raids by enemy aircraft upon London and the south-east of England. Such attempts can only be made by machines leaving and returning to the Belgian coast, and in making them the enemy aircraft are always exposed to encounters with fighting machines of. the most modern description handled by capable pilots.The work of the seaplanes is in a large measure similar to that of the aeroplanes, but their special function is reconnaissance to seaward over the minefields off the enemy&apos;s coast, and spotting for monitors firing wheii bombardment of the coast is in progress.
Seaplane Carriers in Home Waters. : .There are four seaplane-carrying ships employed in conjunction with the fleet in home waters, and some kite-balloon ships.The most important work under this heading is that with the Grand Meet in the North Sea. For this purpose special large carriers are required fit to accompany the fleet at a high speed whatever the weather conditions. One such ship is now with the fleet, and a second is being built. Other carriers are based on the East Coast and at Dunkirk, and work in conjunction with the forces operating from those ports.Luxenil: Belforl.A Wing is stationed in this area for the purpose of carrying out bombing raids on the enemy territory in conjunction with the French. The principal objectives have been blast furnaces&quot; and other ironworks in the Sarre Valley. A number of raids have been carried out, and there is good reason to believe that a considerable amount of destruction has been brought about. One squadron has recently been withdrawn from this force in order that the personnel may be employed on other more urgent service.Central Mediterranean.A Wing is in progress of formation for patrol work from Malta and the adjacent littoral. The most important function is the maintenance of constant air patrols against submarines at the entrance to the Adriatic. A special station is being prepared at Otranto for this service.Eastern Mediterranean.   The Aegean.A number of small stations have been established on the islands in the iEgean. in proximity to the coasts held by the enemy. Constant watch is kept on the movements of enemy craft in the Dardanelles, and much bombing and reconnaissance work is carried out against the camps, bridges, and lines of communication held by the enemy in Bulgaria^Anti-submarine patrols are an important feature of the work in this, as in other areas. Numerous encounters have occurred with enemy aircraft, and several notable feats have been achieved in this field of operation. Flights have been made to Constantinople, Adrianople, and other objectives far inland. Bridges have been successfully bombed, and during the Dardanelles campaign ships were actually sunk by torpedoes carried over the Peninsula and tired from seaplanes.On Rumania joining the Allies a certain number of machines flew across the enernv territory from the islands of Thasos and Imbros into Rumania to assist the armies operating in that area.Sea,plane Carriers in the Mgean.Dp to the present one seaplane carrier and one dep6t ship have been maintained, the depot ship at Mudros and the fast carrier operating as necessary against the Bulgarian coast or the Turkish forces in the Smyrna district. The latter ship is now being sent to operate temporarily on the Syrian coast.Port Said.A small depdt is maintained at Port Said as a base for the seaplane carriers operating under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, whose head-quarters are now at Port Said. One of these ships, unfortunately recently lost, was a fast carrier and is for the time being replaced, as mentioned above, by the carrier now in the iEgean. The two remaining vessels are captured enemy ships which have been adapted for the purpose.The work carried out in this area is of great importance and of the utmost value to the Army in Egypt. Constant observations are made as to the work in progress on the enemy&apos;s lines of communication extending the whole length of the Syrian coast. All this work is carried out by seaplanes, and numerous flights extending long distances inland have been made to obtain photographs of camps and general information as to the enemy^s dispositions and concentration of forces. Many bomb attacks on camps and bridges have also been carried out.
: The coast helcT by the enemy in the Red Sea has been visited, and reconnaissance flights carried out when required. Bomb attacks have also been/carried out on points of importance on this coast and in the vicinity of Aden.&apos;    ^ ^  v&apos;---      -*Mesopotamia.At the commencement of the operations in Mesopotamia a force of aeroplanes and seaplanes was sent to assist in the operations, but this has now been withdrawn. Kite balloons supplied by the Navy are, however, still operating with the military-force in this area.South-East Africa. ,  /, . tA kite balloon ship and a squadron of seaplanes have been continuously employed on the coast carrying out observation and photographic work, spotting for ships firing, &amp;c, and in a large measure their assistance rendered the destruction of the German cruiser &quot; Kdnigsberg &quot; possible. A force of aeroplanes was supplied afc an early stage of the operations, has done a very large-amount of flying, and has been reported as of very great value by the military authorities. Up to a recent date this force was still working under General Smuts.Training.To maintain the large forces of Naval Air Service units operating in the various theatres of war a considerable training organisation is needed. There are five inland stations in England, and one in France, for this purpose, at which training in all its-branches, including bomb-clropping-and the use, of fighting weapons in the air, is continuously carried out with an Q,Yer-increasing number of pupils. Special training in seaplane work is given to all-pilots, intended to fly seaplanes at Oaishot, a station at the entrance to Southampton Water.Experimental Work. &apos; ;Much experimental work is continuously in progress, and with the constant change and-improvement in all classes of aircraft this is a matter of the utmost importance.General Remarks.Seaplanes. - :The problems involved in the design and construction of seaplanes are much more difficult than in the case of aeroplanes. This is principally due to the necessity for machines alighting on, and rising from, the sea under varying weather conditions and the additional weight involved by the; fitting of float or other buoyancy arrange-ments instead of a wheel chassis suitable for travelling over a smooth aerodrome. Great progress has recently been made and excellent results have been achieved with the latest types. In the near future the value of these craft will be much enhanced by their increased range and seaworthiness.&quot; Attention is being given to the development of special types for use in submarine patrol work.Airships.Small ships were provided early in the war and distributed round the coast for submarine observation purposes. These ships are dependent on the weather, and can only be used under favourable conditions. Much useful work has, however, been carried out, and the experience gained tends to show that, with increased speed and reliability, this class of craft will become of increasing importance in the future. On more than one occasion submarines have actually been attacked and depth charges dropped, principally in the vicinity of Land&apos;s End. A new and larger class, known as the &quot; North Sea type,&quot; is under trial, and promises to be a useful ship, both for anti-submarine work and long-distance reconnaissance on the East Coast.[433] F
Eigid airships are under construction, and it is hoped that several will be ready this summer. These are ships of moderate size; so soon as they are completed, further construction of ships of similar size to the latest Zeppelins will commence. One rigid has already been completed and flown, but this is only intended for instruc-tional purposes.Kite Balloons.In the early stages of the war the whole of the kite-balloon production was in the hands of the Navy, who provided this useful form of observation for military as well as naval purposes. With the increasing importance of kite balloons on the &quot;Western Front, the production of these for military purposes has been taken over by the Royal Flying Corps.Kite balloons are being used by the Navy as an aid to submarine hunting, and experiments are proceeding to ascertain the utility of balloons towed from ships as an adjunct to naval observation. Stations to provide balloons for the latter purpose are under construction at Rosyth, Firth of Forth, and in the Orkneys.THE OVERSEAS EXPEDITIONS AND TRANSPORTATION.Allusion has already been made to the subsidiary work of the navies of the British Empire in connection with the transport, supply, and maintenance of the Expeditionary Forces in France, Salonica, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and East Africa. The transports and other vessels of all kinds have to be provided, fitted, and run by the Admiralty, and in addition all troop transports and vessels with -\aluable cargoes must be escorted by naval vessels through any dangerous areas.Tables are attached which show the great number of merchant steamers which are employed on this work, and are consequently withdrawn from the service of transportation of necessities to this country and our Allies.The first Table shows that forty-nine steamers are employed as commissioned fleet auxiliaries, solelv for the subsidiary naval services in connection with the Overseas Expeditions apart from France.The second Table gives the number of steamers continuously employed in carrying troops and stores to all the Expeditionary Forces. From this it will be seen that 360 ships are used for the traffic with France, ]51 for Salonica and Egypt, 95 for Mesopotamia, and 25 for East Africa, making a total of 631 ships of a tonnage exceeding 2,000,000. The average daily number of passages of cross-channel transports to and from France during the past month has been over thirty each way.Table III gives an analysis of the 341 military transports which are included in the 631 ships mentioned above, showing the exact employment of each.In addition to the foregoing, nineteen colliers of approximately 16.000 tons are carrying cargoes for the Expeditionary Forces in France. They make an average of about forty cargoes per month.At the present time practically every ship coming to this country carries Govern-ment material in greater or less quantity. For instance, the passenger liners from the United States reserve 85 per cent, of their cargo space for Government munitions and foodstuffs. Special arrangements must be made in all cases of valuable cargoes to bring these ships in safely, as is done with regular transport and supply ships, and the work of escort is therefore enormously increased.

(both lost), the former off the Coa^t of New Britain (late New Pomerania), and the latter in Sea of Marmora.Gunboat &quot;Una&quot; (late &quot;Komet&quot; captured from the Germans in New Guinea).In addition to the above the undermentioned Fleet Auxiliaries were equipped and commissioned for service with H.M.A. ships :--H.M.A.S. &quot; Berrima&quot; (armed transport), ,,      &quot; Aorangi &quot; (supply ship),&quot; Upolu&quot; (submarine depdt ship), * -&quot; Grantala Castle&quot; (hospital ship), ,-,      &quot; Sleuth &quot; (patrol vessel), Fleet Oiler &quot; Esturia &quot; (chartered)^and the following vessels which wore built in the United Kingdom for the Commonwealth have been placed at disposal of the Admiralty : H.M.A.S. &quot; Kurumba&quot; (oil supply ship).&quot;.     &quot; Platypus &quot; (submarine depdt ship).In the early days of the war the ships of the Australian Navy wrere employed in the operations entailed by the presence of the German Squadron in the Pacific in the occupati; n of German New Guinea, New Pomerania, Samoa, and islands in the Pacific, in escorting transports conveying New Zealand troops to Samoa, and Australian and New Zealand troops to England during the period that the &quot; Euiden &quot; was operating in the Indian Ocean, and which wras terminated by her destruction by H.A1.A.S. &quot; Sydney,&quot; at the Cocus Islands.Subsequently the.&quot; Australia,&quot; &quot;Melbourne,&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; joined the Grand Fleet, and the &quot;Brisbane,&quot; the fleet in the Mediterranean, the &quot; Melbourne&apos;&apos; and &apos;; Sydney &quot; having been previously employed for some time in North America and the West Indies.The &quot;Pioneer&quot; did good service on the East Coast of Africa in connection with the operations against the &quot; Konigsberg.&quot;The &quot; Encounter,&quot; &quot; Psyche,&quot; &quot; Fautome,&quot; and all destroyers have beeni employed in the Straits of Malacca and Dutch East Indies, but now the &quot; Encounter&quot; and three destroyers have returned to Australian waters, whilst the &quot;Psyche&quot; is on the China Station. The destroyers in the Straits are relieved periodically by those from Australian waters.Submarine A.E. 2, which was the first submarine to enter the Sea of Marmora, passed through the Dardanelles submerged, sinking en route the Turkish torpedo gun-boat &quot; Peik-I-Shevket&quot; off Chanak, and after operating for some days in the Sea of Marmora was unfortunately lost, the whole of her crew being captured and made prisoners.Apart from ships, Australia has maintained the dockyards at Garden Island and Cockatoo Island, Sydney, in which yards during the war BAM.A. ships &quot;Brisbane,&quot; [433] &apos; G
&apos;4 Huon,&quot;:&quot; Torrens,&quot; and[&quot; Swan&quot; have been completed; a large number of Australian transports have been fitted out and some of H.M. Armed Merchant Cruisers have been equipped; whilst the new light cruiser &quot; Adelaide&quot; has been laid down and is now in course of construction.The following naval establishments has also been maintained during the war, from which a number of officers and several hundred trained ratings have been supplied and sent to H.M.A. ships, &amp;c.:-H.M.A.S. &quot; Penguin,&quot; Dep6t and Receiving Ship, Sydney, N.S.W. ;. &quot; Tingira&quot; (seagoing tender &quot; Gavuridah &quot;), Boys&apos; Training Ship,&apos; Sydney, N.S.W.   . &quot;:.   ..,,      &quot;Cerberus&quot;   (seagoing   tender  &quot;Protector&quot;),   I)ep6t, Gunnery and Torpedo Schools, Williamstown, Vic. R.A.N. College (seagoing tender &quot;Franklin&quot;), Cadet Midshipman Training College.Note. The first batch of twenty-two Australian midshipmen are now due to arrive in England for disposal in H.M. and H.M.A. ships of Grand Eleet.An Intelligence Staff and Organisation on foreign and Wireless Telegraph Service throughout the country has been organised, and works in co-operation with Admiralty. &apos;A &quot; heavy bridging tiain,&quot; with a personnel of 400 officers and men, supplied by R.A.N. and R.A.N.R., was constructed and completely equipped in Cockatoo Dock-yard, and was sent to Egypt, and subsequently rendered good service at the landing at Suvla Bay and on the Suez Canal, and is now attached to the Military Expeditionary Eorce in Egypt.New Zealand. -New Zealand bore the cost of the battle cruiser &quot;New Zealand,&quot; which has been in the Grand Fleet throughout the war, and has also provided ratings for manning the &quot; Philomel&quot; and &quot; Pyramus,&quot; while 91 R.N.V.R. officers and over 160 ratings have been sent home for service in the Fleet and Auxiliary Patrol Service.An Expeditionary Force from New Zealand, escorted by H.M. and H.M.A. ships, occupied Samoa.South Africa.The South African Division R.N.V.R. have been employed on various services on the Cape Station, such as forming part of the crews of H.M. ships, as crews of guns mounted on shore, assisting in the Transport work, and in the dockyard at Simons-town. South Africa has also sent to England over 100 men of the South African Division of the R.N.V.R. for service in the fleet. During the operations in South-west Africa, which were conducted entirely by the Union Government, the transport, service in connection with the expedition was also administered by them.Canada.At the outbreak of war. H.M. Canadian ships &quot; Niobe,&quot; &quot;Rainbow,&quot; and the sloops &quot;Shearwater&quot; and &quot;Algerine&quot; were placed at the service of the Admiralty. The &quot; Niobe&quot; has since been transformed into a dep6t ship at Halifax. In addition to the provision of the men required to man these ships, a scheme of recruiting in the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Service for the Overseas Division has been established, and over 500 men have been sent to England for service in the fleet, and there are under-stood to be a considerable number more waiting to be sent; 264 Sub-Lieutenants, R.N.V.R., and 112 mechanic ratings have also been provided for service in the auxiliary patrol service in European waters. The dockyards at Halifax and Esquimalt and the floating dock at Prince Rupert have been of great assistance to the Royal Navy and also Vickers&apos; ]fard at Montreal.A patrol service, consisting of twelve small armed vessels and some motor-launches, has been organised, in conjunction with Newfoundland, for service on the Atlantic coast, and other vessels have been equipped for minesweeping. Thirty-six trawlers and 100 drifters are being built for these services in Canada, the Canadian Government having underiaken the contracts and work of construction.
NAVAL CONTRIBUTIONS   BY THE  DOMINIONS AND INDIA.Contributions towards the cost of maintenance of the Imperial Navy are now being paid by the Government of India, the Union of South Africa, and by the Colony of Newfoundland, viz:-Two submarines, purchased in America and manned by Canadian crews, were commissioned on the Pacific Coast for defence against the German Pacific Squadron, rendered valuable service. ,Ten submarines were built by the Bethlehem Steel Company, United States, in Vickers&apos; Yard at Montreal, work- for the Canadian Government being postponed for the purpose. A large number of motor-launches were constructed in Canada, and an icebreaker, in course of building for the Canadian Government, was surrendered to Russia. Messrs. Vickers (Limited) have also built at Montreal three submarines for &apos; Russia and two for Italy.   Nine others are under construction for Bussia.Arrangements have been made for building merchant ships in Canadian yards.An Intelligence Staff has been organised and works in close co-operation with the Admiralty Intelligence organisation.Newfoundland.A contribution of 1,500 men from the Naval Reserve has been made for service in the Fleet and in the Auxiliary Patrol Service on the*coasts of Great Britain, and in conjunction with Canada a Patrol Service has been established.Allusion has been-made to the great value of the services rendered by the Newfoundland R.N.R. men in the ships of the 10th Cruiser Squadron.India.Arrangements had been made for certain of R.I.M. ships to be transferred to the Royal Navy on the outbreak of war, but the Indian Government has gone beyond these, and the following ships have also been placed at Admiralty disposal: &quot; Dalhousie,&quot;&quot;Dufferin.&quot;&quot; Hsrdinge.&quot;&quot; Laurence.&quot;&quot;Minto.&quot;&quot; Northbrook.&quot;*These have been employed in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean.The Indian Government is responsible for defended ports, and is making arrangements for minesweeping at various ports.Valuable assistance has been rendered to the Transport Service in India, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.General.The question of building merchant-ships in the Dominions and India has been under consideration, but, except&apos; in Australia and Canada, no men-of-wTar have so far been constructed.All the Dominions and India have co-operated in the Transport Service, as is shown in the Memorandum issued from the Ministry of Shipping.With respect to directions in which further naval co-operation could be given, it is advisable that during the continuance of this war naval co-operation should proceed on the lines of the existing arrangements, but great assistance can be rendered in the development of Auxiliary Patrol Services, more especially on the Atlantic Coast of Canada where submarines will probably operate, and to the general establishment of minesweeping services.These latter should be organised and the necessary stores provided. The personnel should be trained and vessels allocated, but the latter need not be devoted entirely to the purpose until the necessity arises.
India,.(a.) In 1862 the Indian Navy which had been maintained, hitherto, by the East India Company was taken over by the Imperial Government, but no charge was.made on India by the Admiralty for Naval services until 1869 when the Government of India agreed to pay 70,000/. per annum, calculated on a basis of numbers employed in Indian service, (i.e. 70/. per man for a total complement of 1,000 men). This arrangement continued until 1887-88 when it was decided to reduce the East Indies Squadron, with the result that the contribution fell to 38,5001. per annum plus a charge of 5 per cent, on the cost of the Sphinx&quot; which ship was specially kept in the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, a long discussion as to the justice of claiming a larger contribution ended in a Foreign Office Conference which decided that India was to pay the whole cos* of the entire number of ships agreed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India to be employed within certain limits of the East Indies Station for Indian purposes.After a long discussion with the India Office, which was referred to the arbitra-tion of Lord Rosebery, it was arranged in 1895 that India should pay a round sum of 100,000/. per annum, plus the cost of the repairs of H.M.S. &quot;Sphinx &quot; in India, for ten years as from 1891 in respect of jthe maintenance of four ships, the Admiralty waiving arrears to the extent of 183,000/.The gentral question relating to this contribution was considered by the Royal Commission on the Administration of the Expenditure of India (18th May, 1900), and the conclusion arrived at was that the contribution of 100,000/. per annum was not excessive, and it was suggested by the Commission that the arrangement should be continued till the 31st March, 1906. &quot;Meanwhile (in 1901) the number of the sub-, sidised ships was reduced from four to three, with the consent of India, but the payment of 100,0U0/1 per annum was not reduced, and that sum is being contributed up to the present time as a temporary arrangement from year to year.In 1907 and 1908 suggestions were made for an increased payment from India, and in March 1913 the Admiralty approached the India Office with a proposal that Indian revenues should contribute on a wider basis towards the cost of the Imperial Navy.(b.) In the year 1888 an agreement was concluded between the Admiralty and the India Office whereby provision was made for manning certain floating defences of Indian ports and harbours during peace and war on payment of a fixed subsidy.Under that arrangement a flotilla of ships was provided by India at the expense of Indian revenues, while all responsibility for the efficient manning, maintenance, and control of the ships remained with the Admiralty.. Navy votes.wrere reimbursed by means of a fixed annual payment from India of 61,600/. A first payment, on account was received in 1891-92. The agreement terminated on the 31st March, 1903, it having been considered that the vessels could be dispensed with without impairing the efficiency of the-defence of the Indian ports.(c.) Commencing with the year 1911-12, India has been repaying&apos;annually (in addition to the fixed contribution of 100,000/.) a portion of the expenses incurred by the Admiralty in the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The amounts received were as follows : 1911-12 ...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 108,5001912-13.................. 64,0001913-14 ...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 59,0001914-15 ...         ...         ...         ...         ...         ... 46,0001915-16.................. 9,000This arrangement terminated in August 1914.  .India.

125 , &apos;. Union of South Africa, -       . &quot; .   : . -; The contribution of 85,000/. paid by the Union of South Africa consists of the contributions which were &quot;payable by Cape Colony and Natal, separately, before the establishment of the Union, viz.: .   Cape Colony : 50,000/. (30,000/. from 1898, increased to 50,000/. in 1902) Natal: .35,000/., since 1903.&apos;   The Admiralty has also received from Natal certain.gifts of coal, or cash in lieu, of coal. .Newfoundland. .This Colony in 1902 agreed to contribute 3,000/. annually for a period of ten years in respect of the maintenance of a branch of the lloyal Naval Reserve in the Colony, on condition that the force should consist of not less than 600 men, the annual payment to be proportionately reduced for each man in cases where numbers were underborne. The Colony also arranged to pay 1,800/. to defray the cost of the &quot;housing in&quot; of H.M.S. &quot; Calypso&quot; as a drill ship for the Reserve.This contribution is still being paid.Australia and New Zealand. .Prior to the year 1888 no contribution was made either by Australia or New Zealand to the Imperial Exchequer on account of services rendered by the Imperial Navy; but expenditure had been incurred and borne by Australia for many years previously on the maintenance of purely, local naval forces required for harbour and coast defence.In the year 1888, however, the Admiralty and the several Colonies concerned concluded an agreement (called the &quot; Australasian Agreement&quot;) which provided for the construction of five fast cruisers and two gunboats for the protection of the floating trade in Australasian waters, to augment the then existing Imperial naval force in those waters. The local, naval forces referred to above were not affected by this agreement.Effect was given to this agreement and other schemes of Imperial defence in the &quot; Imperial Defence Act, 18S8 &quot; (51 &amp; 52 Vic, c. 32), authority being given therein1 for the construction of the vessels in question &quot;under the&apos; following conditions, principally: 1. Vessels to be built at the charge of Imperial funds. 2. The Colonies to pay to the Admiralty:-(a.) Interest at the rate of 5 per cent, on the prime cost of the ships, suchpayment not to exceed 35,030/. annually. (6.) Charges for maintenance of the vessels, such payment not to exceed91,000/. annually.3. The agreement to run for ten years.4 On the termination of the agreement, the vessels to remain the property of the . Admiraltv.Of the total of 126,000/. annually, thus payable to naval funds, 106,000/. was paid: by Australia and 20,000/. by New Zealand;The first payment from the Colonies under this arrangement was received for the vear 1891-92.&quot;In the year 1902 the foregoing agreement was replaced by another agreement which provided for the strengthening of the Imperial squadron in Australasian waters and for the establishment of branches of the Royal Naval Reserve in Australia and New Zealand, involving the following payments to the Admiralty, viz. :-s -. - Not exceeding&apos; &apos; , : Annually.fFrom Australia: 5/12ths of the total annual cost of maintenance ... 200,000 From New Zealand: 1/12th of the total annual cost of maintenance ...    40,000(&quot; Maintenance&quot; including 5 per cent, on the prime cost of the ships comprising the naval force on the station.)[433] 11
This agreement commenced to run in November 1903 for a period of ten years, and the previous agreement terminated.In 1907, and again in 1909, Australia proposed the establishment of a local naval force to be constructed by, and. to be under the control of the Commonwealth, and these proposals were considered by the Colonial Conference held in 19G9.Eventually it was agreed that an Australian fleet unit should be constructed and maintained at Commonwealth expense, and that the Imperial Government, until such time as the Commonwealth could take over the whole cost, should assist the Commonwealth&apos; Government by an annual contribution of 250,000Z. towards the maintenance of the complete fleet unit. Subsequently, Australia agreed to waive the payment of the contribution of 250,0001. from the Admiralty.The fleet unit constructed at the cost of the Commonwealth under this arrange-ment consisted of the following vessels : 1 battle cruiser, 3 light cruisers,6 destroyers, ;2 submarines (E Clas-s).It was further arranged that the annual contribution of 200,0001. from Australia under the agreement of 1903 should be paid to the Imperial Government up to the time when the then existing Australian squadron should be relieved by the new Australian fleet unit, and the final payment was made in 1913-14 accordingly.New Zealand, commencing with the year 1909-10, increased the contribution payable by the Dominion under the agreement of 1902 from 40,000Z. to 1()0,000Z. for a period of ten years, and in March 1909 offered to bear the cost of building and arming a first-class battleship of the latest type, as well as the cost of a second battle-ship if found to be necessary by later events.- The &apos;: New Zealand &quot; (battle-cruiser) was built, accordingly, at the expense of the Dominion, at a total cost (hull and arming) of approximately 1,697,0001.In August 1900, during the discussion at the Imperial Conference, Sir J. Ward, the representative of New Zealand, remarked that on the completion of the fleet unit to be provided by Australia, the naval agreement with Austi-alia and New Zealand would have to be determined, and he proposed that the contribution of 100,000?. from the Dominion should continue.In December 1913, under an Act of the Dominion Legislature, power was taken by the Dominion to incur certain expenditure on New Zealand Naval Defence, and the Admiralty agreed to lend H.M.S. &quot; Philomel&quot; for the purpose of a training ship.Under the Act in question, instead of the fixed sum appropriated by the Dominion Government for naval purposes being handed over to the British Admiralty as hereto-fore, only the balance remaining after the Newr Zealand Government have met the naval expenses for which they themselves will in future provide, will be available for Imperial purposes. The subsidy of 10O,00OZ. was paid for the whole of the year 1913-14, and no further payments have been made.Early in 1914 the New Zealand Minister of Defence, in a letter to the then First Lord, stated that he quite understood that the payment of a variable balance to the Admiralty would present some difficulties from the point of view of naval finance, and he suggested that proposals might be made which would be satisfactory to both parties.It was suggested that the most convenient arrangement, so far as the Admiralty was concerned, would be the payment by the Dominion of a round sum annually w7hich payment should be fixed for a term of years and he subject to revision at the end of each such period. The New Zealand Defence Act does not limit the naval expenditure of the Dominion.Federated Malay States,These -States, in 1913, offered to bear the cost of constructing and arming a first class battleship. A vessel (the &quot; Malaya &quot;) has been completed and is in commission. The estimated total cost is 2,847,000LCanada, - jThe question of establishing a fleet unit for Canada wak discussed at the Colonial Conference of 1909.   The Dominion has purchased the &quot; Niobe&quot; and the &quot; Rainbow &quot;

HABBISON 24/3/1917.from Great Britain, and has acquired by transfer from the Admiralty the Naval Establishments at Halifax and Esquimalt, previously maintained out of Imperial funds.No payment has been made by the Dominion for Naval purposes generally. But a repayment of 7,0001 per annum was made during the years 1894-95 to 1899-1900, on account of the maintenance of a detachment of Royal Marines at Esquimalt.Geylon.During the years 1887-88 to 1890-91 it was arranged that the Government of Ceylon should contribute the sums shown below, in aid of Naval expenditure, viz.:  1887-88    ...        ...        ...        ... ...        ...   5,9501888-89    ...        ...        ...        ...        ...        ...   6,0001889-90    ... ... ... ... ... ...   5,5001890-91    ... ... ... ... ... ...   4,500The contribution in 1890-91 was a final payment.A detailed account of the proceedings at the various conferences at which the subject of Imperial and Colonial Contributions was discussed is contained in the undermentioned Parliamentary papers, viz.: Colonial Conference 1902 (Cd. 1299-1902).Naval Defence of Australia and New Zealand (Cd. 4325-1908).Conference   with   Representatives   of   the   Self-Governing   Dominions  (Cd.4948-1909).
