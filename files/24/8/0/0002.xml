CONFIDENTIAL. Printed for the use of the Imperial War CabinetNo.MEMORANDUM ON THE ASSISTANCE OF THE COLONIES ANDPROTECTORATES IN THE WAR.(a) Introductory.Any attempt to appraise the military or financial effort of the Colonies and Protectorates by bare figures or percentages would be misleading. Due regard must be had to the proportion of Europeans and natives, and still more to the fighting qualities of the coloured race. There are coloured races whom it is hope-less to employ for any strictly military purpose; and in a few of the Colonies due investigation by the military and civil authorities has shown that it is &quot; impossible to raise a unit of any military value/&apos; In such a case all that can be done is to raise &quot; labour battalions &quot; as and when the military authorities require. But the value of such battalions is seriously lessened by &quot;the fact that they cannot be employed in the colder climate of Europe save for a brief period 6f the year. Coloured labour is therefore available only for the subordinate theatres of avar in Mesopotamia and East Africa. The Colonies are freely drawn upon for these theatres, but can unfortunately do little for the Western or the Salonica, fronts.Again, where the population is of mixed race political difficulties in the Colony itself, and the feeling of white troops towards the coloured officer, restrict the apparent supply of fighting men.Similarly, in dealing with the financial effort of the Colonies and Protec-torates it is necessary to bear in mind both the state of their finances prior to the War and the effect of the War and other events on their staple industries. A Colony, so far as it is dependent on sugar or rubber, will have benefited financially by the War; another, possibly in the same part of the world, but dependent on fruit or cotton, will have difficulty in making both ends meet.When due allowance is made for these and other less important difficulties it may confidently be said that the Colonies and Protectorates are, as a whole, making their utmost effort in the common cause.(b) Men. WEST INDIES.The West Indies have a male population of about 1,040,000 in all, of whom some 150,000 are East Indian coolies, of little or no use for military purposes. The proportion of Europeans varies from one per cent, to five per cent., but the Europeans may be dismissed. No record has been kept of the number of Europeans who have returned from the West Indies to join the New Army, but practically every available man has gone, as is shown by the impossibility of finding European officers for the West Indian contingents. From the negro population, in addition to the two battalions of the old regular West India Regiment, there have been raised contingents forming the British West Indies Regiment, which is drawn from all the West Indian Colonies, and amounts at present to about 10,000 men. There are also local defence forces.Jamaica, as the largest West Indian Colony, has now been invited by the Army Council to raise as many ba.ttalions as can be obtained, and the local Govern-ment is preparing a Bill to enforce conscription, if necessary, though it anticipates little difficulty in recruiting most of the available population of military age without recourse to conscription. There is little doubt that the other West Indian Colonies will do the same as soon as transports can be supplied to move their contingents.EASTERN COLONIES.In the Eastern Colonies the question of military value of the population is specially important. The coloured population &quot; is largely of * the Indian coolie class which cannot be employed for fighting purposes, but can only be used m labour battalions. Such corps have been, or are being, raised in Seychelles tor j^ast Africa, and m Mauritius for Mesopotamia, and a large number of skilled&apos; labourers have been sent to Mesopotamia from the Straits Settlements.   Whether-Revise.   War Conference. 7399.      30, 50.
a labour force is to be raised in Ceylon or not depends on the requirements m Mesopotamia, as to which the War Office have not yet received the report or tne General Officer -Commanding. It is, of course, impracticable to use any labour battalions from the Eastern Colonies continuously in Europe, but m Wei-nai-wei a great effort is being made to raise some 50,000 or more Northern Chinese who will be able to stand a European winter. The Chinese available in Hong Kong-come from the south of China, and are not so suitable for European climatic conditions.  In order not to prejudice the more important labour contingent trom Wei-hai-wei through difficulties with the Chinese Government, it was found imperatively necessary to abandon all idea of raising a fighting force from the population of Chinese descent in the Eastern Colonies. Thus the whole 0.1 Wei-hai-wei and Hong Kong and a portion of the Straits Settlements and the Malay States are ruled out of consideration for purposes of fighting units.Europeans have come home from the Eastern Colonies&apos; in large numbers to join the New Army. Ceylon sent a contingent 230 strong in November, 1914, to Egypt, and subsequently, to the Dardanelles, and since then has sent smaller parties &quot;home to enlist. * In Malaya, which has sent home a very large number of Europeans to join the Army, Commissions have now been appointed on the lines of the tribunals at home, to decide between volunteers for service and their employers, and similar action is being taken in Hong Kong.In the far Eastern Colonies the clanger of internal disturbance cannot be neglected. There has been a rising in the Straits Settlements and very serious riots in Ceylon. In spite of this these Colonies have released their standing garrisons by raising local volunteer forces, and have made, or are making, volunteering compulsory for Europeans. Similar action is being taken in Hong Kong.FIJI.Fiji, out of a total white population of about 4,000, has sent contingents to His Majesty&apos;s forces of 141 men, besides which about 280 men have joined the Australian or New Zealand Expeditionary Forces; or have enlisted in this country.OTHER COLONIES OUTSIDE AFRICA.Of the smaller non-African Colonies it may be mentioned that Bermuda, out of a population of 6,700 Europeans, has contributed a company to a British regiment and a force of field and garrison artillery from the coloured population, besides providing a militia regiment for the garrison. The Falkland Islands and St. Helena have raised volunteer regiments for garrison duty.WEST AFRICAN COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES.The observations at the beginning of this memorandum as to the misleading nature of deductions based solely on statistics of population are particularly applicable when the West African Colonies and Protectorates are considered as a recruiting ground either for combatants or non-combatants. These territories are not, on the whole, thickly populated, but, taken together, they amount to a large area with a large number of inhabitants. The latter represent an immense variety of tribes and languages-there are probably quite thirty distinct languages ^spoken in Nigeria alone-and the people range from primitive savages to races, &quot;both pagan and Mohammedan, possessing a considerable amount of civilization&apos; &quot; Fighting races &quot; in the sense of races whose favourite occupation is fighting  do not exist, and it is to be noted that the races who have in the past fought most vigorously against us-for example, the Ashantis-are generally found to have a special dislike to military discipline. In time of peace it was not easv, in spite of all efforts on the part of recruiting officers, to keep our local forces up to establishment.The military effort of the West African Colonies and Protectorates has never-theless been of great value. The British forces which operated in Togoland and the Cameroons were almost entirely natives of West Africa, and the brilliant campaign which ended in the conquest of the Northern Cameroons was carried out by the Nigerian Regiment of the West African Frontier Force.Nigerian troops have been sent to East Africa and have distinguished them-selyes in the bush fighting, for which they are peculiarly suitable DThe numbers sent to East Africa (up to the beginning of March) are about 2,500 combatants
and about 1,000 carriers and other non-combatants. Arrangements have also been made for the despatch of reinforcing drafts at regular intervals, and a large number of carriers (for whom there is an urgent demand) are . now awaiting transport. It should be borne in mind that it is impossible to reduce the garrisons in West Africa below a certain number, as the possibility of local trouble is always present. It may be mentioned that the threatening movements of the Senussi. in French territory near the Northern Nigeria border have for some time past made it necessary to take military precautions in Nigeria, and that the consider-able German force which escaped into Spanish territory, and was subsequently interned in the adjoining island of Fernando Po, has also been a source of anxiety to the Government of that Protectorate.In order that all possible use should be made of British West Africa as a recruiting ground, the War Office have sent out a special officer (Colonel Hay wood), who has had great experience in West African military affairs, to take charge of the recruiting of further forces for service overseas, and the local authorities are giving him every possible assistance. -Whatever may be the results of Colonel Haywood&apos;s mission, there will be undoubtedly great difficulty in providing a sufficient number of suitable officers and non-commissioned officers. All authorities agree in the opinion that the employment of West African soldiers will not give good results unless they are Jed by men whom they know and-trust. The number of officers and non-commis-sioned officers who have had experience with West African troops is limited, and practically all those available are being employed either in West Africa or with the West African contingents in East Africa. The War Office have done their best to meet us in this matter, even to the extent of getting officers released from the Expeditionary Force in France, but the demand is mainly for company com-rnanders and subalterns; and officers who held these posts in West Africa two or three years ago are now in many cases commanding battalions or holding important appointments, and it is not practicable to order them back.To meet this difficulty a large number of civilian officials with West African experience have been given temporary commissions, and the Governor-General of Nigeria is utilizing in this manner as many men as can possibly be spared from the civil Departments, which have also been considerably depleted by the release of officers lent to the War Office, Admiralty, and Munitions Departments for the duration of the War. There are also some non-official volunteers who are being employed in the same manner, but in the West African Colonies practically the only non-official Europeans (besides missionaries) are the employees of commercial firms, whose principals in this country have already cut down their establishments on. the coast to a minimum.It may be added that native marine ratings have been recruited in Nigeria for service in Mesopotamia.The Colonies of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast are compara-tively small in area and sparsely populated, and the natives are for the most part unwarlike. In spite of these disadvantages the conquest of Togoland, so far as the British share in that achievement is concerned, was carried out singlehanded by the Gold Coast; and all three Colonies sent contingents to assist in the opera-tions in the Cameroons (1914-16). Since then the Gold Coast has sent nearly all its standing military force to East Africa to assist in the operations against the Germans, and the Gambia is now sending the whole of the military force that it maintains (one company) to the same theatre.The standing military forces of Sierra Leone, which were adjudged (after experience of them in the Cameroons) unsuitable for employment against German-led troops in East Africa, are being. utilized as a garrison for Sierra Leone and (temporarily) the Gambia; other companies have been lent-to Nigeria. On the other hand, Sierra Leone is now raising large numbers of carriers for service in East Africa; 1,200 have already been despatched, and 2,000 are ready to go; more can be obtained if required.Recruiting is being actively pushed in the Gold Coast; a reinforcement of 400 was sent to East Africa in November last, and a further reinforcement of 500 is on the verge of following them.With regard to the utilization of the European element from these Colonies 11 must be remembered that there is no settled white population at all, and that Mdiat Europeans there are consist chiefly of Government officials (including military officers) and employees of trading and mining firms.   As regards the latter class many have returned to,this country for service with the Army, and others have
been drawn upon to accompany combatant troops and carriers to East Africa, or for service with the local garrisons. The staff of Government officials has been cut down to the irreducible minimum, and as an illustration of what has been done it may be mentioned that of the whole medical staff not less than one third are serving outside West Africa.EAST AFRICAN PROTECTORATES.Turning now to East Africa, it must be borne in mind that the three Protec-torates mainly in question (East Africa Protectorate, Uganda, and Nyasaland) are of very recent date, that, their industries have scarcely emerged from the experi-mental stage, and that, as far as Europeans are concerned, the population is very small.Nevertheless, the East Africa Protectorate was one of the first parts of the Empire to adopt the principle of compulsory service. As far as settlers of military age are concerned more than two-thirds are on military service, while of the European officials some forty per cent, have joined the colours, and this, too, in a tropical climate where frequent leave is essential for purposes -of health and where the staff already is barely adequate for the work thrown upon it.In Uganda and Nyasaland, although the European population is smaller, the same public spirit has been shown, and it may safely be said that every available-European of military age in these Protectorates is on military service.With regard to the native populations it must be borne in mind that, though these are large, the tribes that are warlike and suitable for fighting material are comparatively scarce. The local native forces (other than police) of the three Protectorates consist of the King&apos;s African Rifles. At the outbreak of war this corps consisted of three battalions of about 2.000 men in all: 1st Battalion, King&apos;s African Rifles, partly in Nyasaland and partly in the East Africa Protectorate: 3rd Battalion, King&apos;s African Rifles, in the East Africa Protectorate; 4th Battalion, King&apos;s African Rifles, in Uganda. Since the outbreak of war these three battalions have been raised to thirteen, &apos;and seven additional battalions (making twenty in all) have been authorized. The total strength of the force at present is well over 10,000, and it is being fully employed in the operations against German East Africa.In addition to the King&apos;s African Rifles, some irregular native troops have been raised in the East Africa Protectorate and Uganda for the local operations.Besides these combatant troops, an immense number of carriers have been recruited in the three Protectorates for the local operations, amounting to mam-tens of thousands in all. 53,000 carriers have been recruited in one Province of the East Africa Protectorate alone, while in Uganda 30,000 have been raised for service with the Belgian troops as well.Zanzibar, which was formerly dependent for its garrison on the East Africa Protectorate, has now&apos; raised a defence force of its own, and provides for its own defence.RHODESIA.Rhodesia has taken an active part in the War. She has provided a regiment SiCjh t00k part in the camPaiSn against German South-West Africa; and another Rhodesian contingent, nearly a thousand strong, partly recruited in the Union of South Africa, was sent to East Africa and has been taking part in the operations The Northern Rhodesia Police and Volunteer Forces, and amative Matabele regi-ment, m addition to several thousand carriers, are also now engaged in the opera-tions against German East Africa from the south, under Brigadier-General Northev Moreover, considerable numbers of Rhodesians have come independently to this country and joined British regiments.(c) Money.WEST INDIES AND EASTERN COLONIES.The West Indies have taken on themselves the cost of transport and non-effective charges for their contingents, besides bearing the cost of their own local defence. Nearly every Colony has voted sums towards the tost of the War. Jamaica is giving  60,000 for forty years. Ceylon has voted  1,000,000 in ten yearly instal-ments, and is considering a further large gift.    The Straits Settlements have
given  1,000,000 in five yearly instalments, have promised another  1,000,000 if the finances permit. The Federated Malay States have voted  500,000 as a gift to his Majesty&apos;s Government, and have paid for the first-class battle-cruiser &quot;Malaya,&quot; Hong Kong has raised a local loan of $3,000,000 and is giving the proceeds to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and has recently given another $2,000,000 out of balances and current revenue. Generally speaking, it may be said that the liabilities which the Colonies have undertaken for the purposes of the War have, with a few exceptions, been larger than prudent finance would allow, but His Majesty&apos;s Government have not considered it desirable to check the desire of the local legislatures and inhabitants to bear their full share of the common burden of the War. Local loans have been, or are being, raised in the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements, and Mauritius, and the proceeds lent to His Majesty&apos;s Government, in the case of Straits Settlements at one per cent, less than they are themselves paying.WEST AFRICAN COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES.The expense of the Cameroons campaign has been to a considerable extent borne by Nigeria, whose share amounts to about  320,000. A considerable pro-portion of this total was generously contributed from Native Treasury funds by the loyal rulers of the Mohammedan emirates of the north. Nigeria has offered to pay, after the conclusion - of peace, the charges for interest and sinking fund of one per cent, on a share of the Imperial War Debt amounting to  6,000,000.The cost of the military forces sent by the Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast to the Cameroons campaign was borne by them, and the British opera-tions in Togoland were carried out entirely at the expense of the Gold Coast, The latter Colony has voted a contribution of  200,000 to the general cost of the War, to be paid by instalments, and is paying a substantial contribution to the cost of sending troops to East Africa, Further, with a view to giving all possible assistance to His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Gold Coast has now set aside a/most necessary scheme of railway development and other important public works, and has invested  500,000 the greater part of the saving thus effected in the War Loan. The Government of Sierra Leone has similarly postponed schemes of rail-way and harbour development.EAST AFRICAN PROTECTORATES.As regards the East African Protectorates, Nyasaland, Uganda, and Somali-land are still State-aided, and, in their case, any Government contribution is out of the question. The East Africa Protectorate itself has only recently emerged from the same conditions. In spite of this, the three East African. Protec-torates, with Zanzibar, are bearing the whole cost of their ordinary local forces who are engaged in the German East Africa operations, and are thus largely con-tributing to the cost of that campaign. These contributions on their part are only possible through the cutting down of expenditure upon such necessary works as those connected with sanitation, housing of officials, and generally the develop-merit of the Protectorates, and it is appreciated that they are, in any case, far less well equipped in this respect than  he older established Colonies.Zanzibar has made two money gifts to His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the cost of carrying on the War, the first of  10,000, the second of  20,000.(d) Raw Materials.In considering the assistance rendered by the Colonies not possessing responsible Government, and Protectorates in controlling supplies of raw materials, two considerations are of importance.(1) The Colonies have been instructed, to adopt automatically the prohibi-tions of exportation established in the United Kingdom. Thus, whenever an article is placed on the prohibited list in this country, it is automatically placed on the prohibited list in all the Colonies and Protectorates. This is apart from any special prohibitions which it may be necessary to establish in the Colonies in addition to or in advance of those established in the United Kingdom.(2) The Colonial Governments only grant exemptions from their prohibi-tions on the instructions of the Secretary of State. In giving those instructions the Secretary of State acts in accordance with the advice of the departments responsible for licensing here.   Thus, His Majesty&apos;s Government can control the
exports of goods from the Colonies in exactly the same way, and to exactly &quot;the same extent, as they can exports from the United Kingdom, whether from the point of view of preventing supplies reaching the enemy or from that of securing for this country or the Allies supplies available in the Colonies.The following are the most important cases where special measures have been taken : (a) The Eastern Colonies produce tin, in respect of which the British Empire can control the world&apos;s supply, and rubber, a large proportion of the world&apos;s supply of which comes from British Colonies and. Protectorates. No rubber can be exported from Ceylon or the Straits, and no tin from the Straits, except by permission of the Rubber and Tin Exports Committee in London.(b) There are in various parts of the Empire considerable supplies of oleaginous nuts, which are important not only in the manufacture of margarine but because glycerine can be obtained from them in varying proportions.The exportation of all such nuts and seeds from the Colonies is prohibited to all foreign countries except our Allies, and the exportation of the oils produced from them is prohibited to all foreign countries. Generally speaking, licences are only granted on conditions which ensure that the glycerine equivalent of the oils, etc., is returned to this country.Reference may also be made to whale oil from the Falklands, the most impor-tant whaling ground in the world. This has all been coming to this country, and steps have for the last two years been taken, by relaxing certain of the conditions previously imposed on whaling, to increase the supplies available, and to put them at the disposal of the Ministry of Munitions for war purposes.(c) As regards metals other than tin, wolfram is found in the Malay Peninsula. Its exportation is being allowed only to the United Kingdom, and all wolfram as it arrives here is requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government for munition purposes.(d) Plumbago, used for lining crucibles, is found in Ceylon. No plumbago has been allowed to be exported from Ceylon to foreign countries since the early days of the War, except to Russia for munitions purposes and to approved firms in the United States of America.(e) British control extends not only to the products of the Colonies but to goods produced in foreign countries which are handled in British Colonies in the way of transhipment or re-exportation, and thus fall within the prohibitions of exportation. Thus Chinese antimony is shipped to Hong Kong and re-exported to the United States of America. Arrangements have been made by which no antimony is allowed to be exported from Hong Kong to the United States unless it is to be used in making munitions for the Allies.(/) A very effective control has been exercised over the supply of bunker coal at ports in the Colonies and Protectorates. As in the United Kingdom and the Self -governing Dominions, bunker coal is supplied only to vessels whose owners have agreed to observe certain conditions prescribed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, or which are actually engaged in voyages in the interest of the Allies.
