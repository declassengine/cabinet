SECRET. G.T. 287.WAR CABINET. .OPERATIONS  .Prom:-   C. in C,   France. 25.3.1917.To:-       CI.G.S.Continuation of my O.A.D. 353 of March 24th.I have now heard the result of Gen. Nivelle&apos;s inspection.I am informed by Wilson that, under present condition^,Nivelle is quite satisfied that there are adequate coast defence -   area inin the/question, for which the French are responsible.   If developments render it desirable, Nivelle will send reinforce-ments to this sector.   Probability of any immediate attempt to effect landing such as suggested by Admiralty is not confirmed by ny information and, in my opinion, it is unlikely to be attempted as an isolated operation.   The attempt is possible, if naval conditions admit, in combination with land attack between Lille and&apos;the sea.   A close watch is being kept for indications of any preparations for such an attack.
