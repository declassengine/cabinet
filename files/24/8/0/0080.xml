GOPY.SECRET WAR CABINETS.T.279INTELLIGENCE .?rom:-      Colonel Knox. 22nd March 191?To D.K.I.1027.Following report received from Colonel Blair, who has returned from south-west front.Of the new 21 Divisions several are already on the front, and &quot;by the beginning of April all will he ready to take their places on the front.     They have no artillery and are to he used as an Infantry reserve to the -Army Corps in which they are formed.     It is hoped to provide one Division of artillery to each new Infantry Division, hut owing to shortage of horses and harness it is impossible at present. There is also a shortage of horses for transport.   Every senior commander to whom I spoke was against the formation of these new Divisions, and they all said that their opinions had not been asked.Preparations are being made for   an offensive in the spring, but owing to the lateness and severity of winter it is not considered that an offensive can be made before the end of April,The snow is still deep and ground in places is still frozen to a depth of 3 to 4 feet.   The main offensive will probably be on 7th Army Front.     Following is present strength of armies on south-western front in Infantry and Cavalry -Divisions:-   Special 20 and 3, 11th 15 and 2, 7th 24 and 2,8th 12 and 2.     Total 71 Infantry Divisions and 9.Cavalry Divisions, with possibly 2 more Infantry Divisions in rear. Units are short of strength and grain for horses is short. This is due to the extremely bad working of railways.   Two months ago there was a great shortage of rations for troops owing to the same cause, but railway situation is improving.
(One group undecipherable) neither reinforcements horses nor munitions are coming up.The spirits of officers and men are good, but the continual sitting passive effects them and they would be improved by active operations.News of change of government has been received by all staffs and by officers with acclamation, and I was assured by everyone that it would have best effect on the men.In Cavalry Divisions all regiments, including the Cossack regiment, are being reduced to 4 squadrons,  and the rifle Division is being expanded to a rifle (?) regiment which it is said will eventually have 16 squadrons of 250 men each.A new railway has been constructed between Kamenets Podolsk and Larga on the No to  Sieltsi line and is now working
