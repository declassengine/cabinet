TRANSPORT WORKERS1 BATTALIONS.There is no record of the actual words used by the Board of Trade representative at the Conference at the Local Government Board on Tuesday, March 13th, but the statement attributed to him omits any reference to the conditions which the Board of Trade regard as indis-pensable in the event of further transport workers being released for the Army. 1The views of the Board of Trade are clearIv stated in the attached memorandum, which was handed in at the Conference.     It will be seen that the possibility of releasing men was distinctly stated to be contingent on the supply of substitutes (in the proportion of 3 to 2), and on the taking of steps to bring the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions to the highest possible strength. .   (See paragraph 4 (d) ).Board of Trade,22nd March, 1917.
MMOMOT.Possibility of releasing 20$ of total number of exempted Dock Transport Workers,On the assumption that the War Cabinet imperative-ly demand such release, it could, in my opinionp be effectedin the following way:-1. The Board have already consented provisionally to the release of men under 20, as soon as substitutes are provided, with the possibility of a further release from month to -month of men in the higher age groups up to 25. By definitely deciding on this arrangement; and speeding it up, 5600 men between 18 and 25 might be released in the four monthsy April to July.2. The submarine difficulty in the North Sea has changed the conditions in the East Coast ports during the last few weeks, and there is an admitted surplus, though.it may only be temporary, at Hull and Leith, and I am inclined to think in London also,   it any rate, the London Committee^, influenced by Major Rothschild, are, I believe, prepared to carry out a drastic revision of existing exemptions.   It might therefore be assumed that at:Hull 360 men between 25 and 30 could be released,leith 52 &quot;     n      n     11  &quot;    &quot;     &quot;     nLondon        4522  &quot;     11      &quot;     &quot;   &quot;    &quot;     &quot;     &quot;The number for London being so high, I would suggest that only half be taken? say 2300.CO
It is possible, too, that Aberdeen, Dundee; Newcastle;1 Sunderland, Hartlepool; and Middlesbrough are in a similar position to the other East Coast ports, and might therefore release men between 25 and 30, or a pro-portion, say half.Aberdeen 32 menDundee 61 &quot;   ,Newcastle -259 &quot;   )   Total   ...      759Middlesbrou^i 308 11   )    Half   . . .      379Hartlepool 34 &quot;Sunderland - 42 &quot;Ipswich. 23 &quot;The total of all the above sources is 8692.The number of exemptions outstanding is, in round numbers;43,000.   20io of this number is 8,600.4.   It must be pointed out that:(a) the surplus at London and the East Coast ports generally may only prove to be temporary.(b)-as there is a corresponding congestion at the West Coast ports, some of this surplus at the Eastern side should be diverted to the vfest.(c) the taking away of all men up to 25,&apos; and of half the men between 25 and 30 involves, not merely the loss of these men, but a considerable diminution of the efficiency of the men who remain;- younger lusty men being necessary for the stiffening of the gangs.(d) the difficulty mentioned in paragraph (c) above might be met to a certain extent by substitution and re-enforcement, the Director-General of National Service pre -viding   three men for 3very two taken, by a general pooling of the remaining surplus left after the withdrawal of men for the Army.   The additional requirements of the Y/est Coast ports, and emergency demands  from the East Coast ports might be met by a pooling scheme and the Board have already under consideration such a s&amp;aeme.
Fooling must, however, he regarded as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s substitutes. The Transport Workers4Battalion must also be brought up to the highest possible strength.5. The Board!s position is therefore this:   that they cannot assume the sole responsibility of taking the grave risks involved in the release of so substantial a proportion of the existing supply of dock labourers of military age, and that if the withdrawal of certificates on so large a scale is insisted upon, the utmost must be done to safeguard the position of the dock transport in-dustry, by facilitating a general pooling of dock labour,&apos; provision of substitutes and re-enforcements, and the ut-ilisation of the Transport Workers&apos;Battalion.    No single one of these devices can be relied upon to meet all emer-geheies;   all must be available.I should add that it is contemplated that the propos-ed general t?oo1 should, in certain cases, be available for the temporary supply of men for the canal wharves and rail-way yards in cases where a state of congestion in the ports is due to the holding up of railway waggons, and b&amp;rgesp on traffic systems serving the ports.    An extension of the Boardfs powers to deal with  port labour might there-fore be necessary, unless an arrangement could be made with the War Office.March 10th, 1917.
