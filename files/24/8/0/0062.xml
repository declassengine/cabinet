If3MINISTRY&quot; QF PENSIONS. Report for perlgd from the 17th March to the 25rd March.1.        The Report Stage of the &quot;Civil Services Supplementary Estimates 1916-17, Ministry of Pensions&quot; was taken on the 19th instant, the Debate being initiated by a speech by Mr. Bogge who again attacked the proposal to give gratuities in place of pensions in cases where disablement was not attributable to or aggravated by military service.     Mr. Hogge&apos;s motion for reduction of the &quot;Vote made mainly on these grounds was seconded by Mr, Dickinson.     The Minister followed on with the announcement of certain modifications vwihich had been introduced into the Warrant as a result-of the Debate on the Committee-Stage.The principal of these, in addition to the one noted -in last week1s   Report, are(1)     the provision of an allowance to a man who has to absent himself from his work for out-patient medical treatment,(2)     the removal of the limit of seven years within union disablement might result in the award of a pension, -and(3)     the placing of the loss of both feet in the highest instead of In the second degree of disablement.Various Members thanked for these.,-concessions and spoke in favour of the provisions of the Warrant but Lir, Pemberton Billing and a few others announced that they would support Mr,\Hogge in his proposal that a pension should be granted for non-attributable and non-aggravated disable-ment.     Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen answered specifically all the points raised In the Debate and very definitely tar. Hogge&apos;s contention.       This, however, was again brought upby
by Mr. Pringle who suggested, as a compromise, that some form of appeal should &quot;be entertained by the Minister. Mr. Bonar Law announced towards the close of the Debate that the Government were willing to raise the gratuity on account of non-attributable and non-aggravated dis-ablement from  100 to  150.       Further consideration hal previously been promised to another concession, viz, the elimination of the word &quot;substantial&quot; before the word &quot;aggravated&quot; in the Articles of the Warrant govern-ing pensions to men when disablement takes effect after discharge and pensions to widows, and the Minister has now decided to concede this.Irish Members, who talked somewhat irrelevant-&apos; ly throughout the Debate brought it to a conclusion by citing cases of individual Irishmen who had, in their opinion, received insufficient pensions.      Mr. Hogge&apos;s motion was defeated by 150 to 51, the minority including all the Nationalists in the House, viz., 29, and 6 Labour Members, 5 Labour Members voting with the majority, 2. The provisions of the New Warrant in additionto entailing instructions, now taking shape, to the various branches of the Ministry dealing with the award and issue of pensions require a reconsideration of the operations with regard to supplementary pensions etc., of the Statutory Committee.       A Memorandum on the subject by the. Chairman of the Finance Sub-Committee is annexed as Appendix I to this Report.     It shows that except with regard to dependants the supplementary pen-sions based on pre-war income given hitherto by the Committee will cease, only supplementary allowances (not granted for more that 12 months being still required in exceptional cases of serious hardship and distress.Allowances
Allowances for treatment and training also removedfrom the sphere of the Committee!s activities. 3. The Proceedings of a further Meeting of the &apos;Minister with his Statutory Advisers at which a draft Warrant for the retired pay f)f disabled officers and pensions to the wives and families of deceased officers was discussed, are annexed as Appendix II. 4. The second reading of the Naval and MilitaryWar Pensions Administrative Expenses Bill of which,a copy formed Appendix IV of the Report for the period from the 23rd January to the 15th February, was carried without a division on the 21st instant.     Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen, who opened the debate disarmed some criticism in advance by indicating the amendments which the Government proposed to put down to meet objections which had been brought to their notice.The general principle of Clause I by which the administrative expenses of the Local Committees are to be borne in equal shares by the Exchequer and by Local Rates, was objected to by certain speakers on behalf of Scotland and Ireland, but the objections v/ere not strongly pressed and the principle was sup-ported by Sir Ryland Adkins speaking as a representa-tive of the County Councils1 association of England and Wales.        There were indications that amendments might be moved in Committee with the object of reduc-ing the burden to be borne by local rates if the principle of joint contribution were maintained.   An amendment has to-day, the 23rd instant, been put down by Mr. Watson with the object of throwing the entire expenses on the Exchequer.     On subsection 4 of this clause, some appreciation was expressed by
Labour Members of the proposal to meet the expenses of travelling and to pay for loss of remunerative time, and it was pointed out that in the absence of this provision labour members had been largely precluded from attending Local Committees.Objection was taken by Sir Norval He line and some other representatives of1 Boroughs to the words in Clause 3 /&quot;after consultation with the County Council&quot;, and fear was expressed that the Minister of Pensions would be exclusively guided in granting or withholding a Local Committee for a Borough between 20,00.0 and 50,000 population by the views of the County Council.     It was pointed out, however, on behalf of the Government, that while the position would have been otherwise had it been a matter of inventing an entirely new system of pensions administration, it was only right that the County Council should be consulted since they had already created an   organisation under the Naval and Military War Pensions Act, 1915, which would be disarranged by the setting up of Local Committees under the Clause.Representations were made bp certain speakers In favour of giving the Metropolitan Boroughs a larger share in pension administration, an it was intimated that amendments would be proposed in Committee to Clause 3 to provide with this in view The Minister pointed out that the matter could not properly be dealt with under Clause 3, as this would involve upsetting entirely the existing system of London administration which was on the whole working satisfactorily.&apos; &apos; -       *&apos;      &apos;   : It -
It was made clear on behalf of the Government that there was no intention on the part of the Pensions Minister of coins behind the trus -* tees ^r managing body of a voluntary fund by the provisions of Clause 4.     He would act only on the application of the trustees and there was no idea of getting the use of these funds for purposes for which the State should properly provide.     A Government amendment would be put down to make this clear.   Mr. Eogge suggested that the Pensions Minister should take even larger powers in order to prevent the waste of local voluntary funds, and proposed to bring up the matter in Committee.     The Committee stage of the Bill ic to be taken on Monday, the 26th instant. 5. A report of the Statutory Committee givingdetails of the work done and of reports received &quot;by them in the week is annexed as Appendix III.     A new local committee has been formed at Portadown in County Armagh and favourable reports have been receive! on the working of the Local Committees at Belfast, Birmingham and West Bromwich, though from the last two places and from Smethwiek and Leeds comes the general complaint of men not being willing to accept training owing to the high rates of wages that obtain. At Southampton certain Trades Unions look with dis-favour on men who have received short courses of traih-ing under the Committee&apos;s schemes and at   Smethwick the Labour Party appear to hatfe started a rival organisation to the Y:ar Pensions Coi;tmitteG.     The jreports that have been received from IP,   large firms, principally in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Indus-tries, show that where there has been sympathetic management the employment of partially disabled dis-    . charged soldiers and sailors has been on the*whole fairly successful.
i6. Distinct from the / ,lTrade &apos; Advisory Committees u.freferred to in paragraph 6 of last week&apos;s report, which have been formed to adv-2se in various matters connected with tho employment of disabled soldiers and sailors in the various trades, the Ministry of Labour have decided to set up by way of experiment In certain Districts &quot;Advisory Wages Boards&quot; for giving advice as to the wage which should be paid to a disabled soldier or sailor who has entered, or is about to enter, civil employment.     A list of these Boards is given in Appendix IV to this Report.7. On the 21st instant the Minister of Pensionsand Parliamentary Secretary, the Vice-Chairman of the Statutory Committee and Major Mitchell, adviser to the Minister in matters of training and employment, attended 9 a Meeting of representatives of Local Ear Pensions Comnr ta tees and of Local Education Authorities in Yorkshire whic had been summoned to consider the organisation for the training of disabled soldiers so as best to utilise the resources for this purpose available in the three Ridings&quot; This is part of a general scheme of the Minister to divid the United Kingdom into some 20 Districts for this pur pose. Tlie Meeting was well attended and Mr. Barnes proposed that a representative body should be set up with the duty of controlling the arrangements under which a disabled soldier could be seat from a rural area to betrained, say in Leeds, the fee for such training to be palon a &quot;per capita&quot; basis by the Local Committee of theDistrict in which the man resides.    Leeds in turn mifhtpay tie fee to some agricultural training college or to j a farmer, if only a practical training were to be given,
in respect of a man sent from the City to take up agriculture.A motion was passed to the effect that for this purpose of the care, training and employment of disabled soldiers and sailors, it was desirable that co-operations should exist between the different war Pensions Committees and Education Authorities in the geographical county, the Red Cross Society, Lord Robert&apos;s Memorial Workshops and other bodies, A Committee was appointed to report generally on the available sources of supply for training disabled men in the geographical county end to suggest the manner in which in their opinion the facilities could be best adapted to meet the requirements of the whole county.       This Committee was to consist   of repre-sentatives of the Education authorities in the three Ridings and the County Boroughs of Yorkshire and of the principals of the large Technical Schools. Another Committee was appointed to consider and report generally on the question of co-operation among the War Pensions Committees with regard to the carrying out of their powers and duties. 8. An intimation has been received from the?sfar Office that under the great pressure which is now foreseen on the Hospital accommodation of this Country it is necessary to suspend for the present the operation of the system of retaining discharged sol-diers in Military Hospitals for such periods as they might be in need of curative treatment as inpatients. This decision of the War Office gives additional importance to those paragraphs of the Army CouncilInstruction
Instruction No. 449 (see-Appendix VII to last weekls report) which deal with the steps to be taken to give to discharged soldiers such further treatment as out-patients in military hospitals as may be necessary and this matter is being watched.9. At the sixth Meeting of the Committee onInstitutional Treatment held on the 19th March certain steps to be taken to hasten Claremont (Esher) being made available for advanced tuberculous^ and Highfields (Gold-ers Green) for   neurasthenic patients were decided on and the question of maintenance charges for epileptics at Chalfont St. Giles (Bucks) and Maghull (Nr, Liverpool) was discussed.       The need for an epileptic colony in Wales was considered and also that for a general register cf cases of disabled men of the four classes dealt with by the Committees that were receiving or had received Institutional Treatment but no decision was come to in either matter.10. Table I shows that 8944&apos;pensions includingChildren&apos;s Allowances were granted during the week against 9869 during the previous week and that 555,783 have been awarded from the commencement of the War up to the 21st instant.Table II shows that during the last week 192 grants of supi-lementary pensions and temporary allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 191 in the previous week and that the total up to date Is 2,267c 11. The staff of the Ministry, not including thatof the- Statutory Committee, has been increased by 80 during the week and now consists of 199 men and 2394 women or 2593 In all, the additions being mainly t&amp; the&quot; women clerks in the Awards to Soldiers and. in the Issuebranches

APPENDIX 1 . -MEMORANDUM BY CHAIRMAN OP THE FINANCESUBCOMMITTEE AS TO THE EFFECT OF THENEW ROYAL WARRANT ON THE REGULATIONSOF THE STATUTORY COMMITTEE.The following Memorandum ie an attempt to shew the general effeot on the Regulations of the Statutory Committee of the proposals oontained in the new Royal Warrant.The matter will have to be considered in oloser detail at ft later stage, but for the present, having regard to the fact that the draft Warrant may be amended in certain respeots and pending the approval of the Code of Instructions as to the manner in which oertain Articles of the Warrant are to be administered, it ic desirable to take a more general view.Fir^t of all, as to the main principles involved. The foundation principle of the Statutory Committee1^ action has been the existence of need and the object has been to remove speoial hardship, and in considering the latter an important factor has been the disproportion between present and pre-war income of the beneficiaries.    We have sought to reduce this disproportion thus giving some effect to the principle of equality of pecuniary sacrifice.     In the case of&apos;al^ supplementary pensions and allowances the Act of 1916 stipulated that they were to be given only in exceptional circumstances, where the State pension or allowance appeared to the Committee to be inadequate.     This principle was followed throughout the Regulationo and Instructions,     Its application involved the consideration of the financial circumstances of the household of which the applicant for a pension or allowance formed a part;   of the earnings or earning capacity of all those who contributed or could reasonably be expected to contribute
towards the common fund and of income from all sources.   As far as possible special matters affecting expenditure were:* - &apos;       -v&quot;--\ &quot;    - &apos; &apos; utaken into account, e.g. the number and age of children, permanent ill-health etc.     To a large extent this principle of need has been ignored in the New Warrant.     The raising of the minimum amount of pension by  substantial sums will undoubtedly give a higher pension in many caceo than the Statutory Committee would have considered neceooary from the point of view of peouniary need.     But a more important point io that under the new Warrant the alternative pension, i.e. to the disabled man and to the widow, based, as it Id, upon pre-war earnings gives effect to the principle of equality of pecuniary sacrifice and moreover it can be claimed as a right (subject to a formal reservation ao regards the widow) and not becauoe of need.     To some extent thin changeio reflected in the minimum pension to the disabled man.     Under the old Warrant hie pension was calculated, except in special casec. on the degree of impairment of earning capacity but under the new Warrant the assessment for minimum pension is on the basis of the degree of injury or disablement without direct conoidera-tion as to the extent to which such injury or disablement may affect the man&apos;o capacity for earning, although no doubt this is an indirect factor.     It is true that for the purpose of the alternative pension to a disabled man or to a tfldow the man&apos;s pre-war earningo are taken as      the baoio and therefore to the extent to which ouch earnings are an index of the financial position of the household the factor of pecuniary need is not unreoognised, but no matter how large an income a man might have been receiving in addition to hie actual earnings or what capacity may remain to him for supplementing
his pension, hi3 entitlement to an alternative pension is unaffected thereby.     While under the terms of the Warrant the widow10 pension cannot be claimed as a right but is given as a reward for the man!o service, it is clear that inasmuch as the amount of the pension is based on pre-war circumstances only to the extent to which the husband&apos;s earnrngn determined such circumstances and takeo no account of present financial circumstances or earning capacities, the award of the pension becomes virtually an entitlement thereto If the conditions as to the man&apos;e service obtain and the widow Ic not guilty of unworthy conduct.There are some matters in which it ie the obvious intention of the new Warrant to supersede what has been done by the Statutory Committee;   there are other matt^ro dealt with by the Statutory Committee which the new Warrant does not touchj and lastly there are Regulations of the Statutory Committee which, while not directly covered by the new Warrant, are affected thereby and may have to be reoast.The most important question of principle which the Sub-Committee have to consider i3 their attitude towards the firct category of cases.     Can the ne?; Warrant and Order in Council be held to be the measure cf the State&apos;s obligation to the disabled men and the dependants of thooe who have fallen?    It is certainly the reoult of the most mature and deliberate consideration and purports to bring within its scope all caoeo which can be scheduled as constituting legitimate claims upon the State.     It is the obvious intention of the system of alternative pensions therein provided for to supersede the oystem of supplementary penoions granted under our Regulations.    There is no doubt that the former ic more liberal than the latter, although there may be a few cases-o-
where this is not 30.     Broadly speaking, therefore, it must be held that the new displaces the old as a system, and the new will be administered by the statutory Committee and the Local Committees as agento of the Pensions Minister.It does not follow, however, that all hard cases are thus provided for and our experience goes to 3hew that there will be many individual cases where serious hardbhip will be found to exist notwithstanding the more liberal provisions of the new Warrant.     There will, therefore, clearly remain a province within which the Statutory Committee can and should operate, although the effect of the new Warrant will be to reduce largely the area of the Committeefs action.     so far as the Committee administer voluntary funds and make compassionate grants thereout to meet hard canes no question arises.     But the Committee will no doubt feel that they have a claim to a State grant to enable them to supplement In cases of individual hardship the pensions and allowances on the new bases laid down on the Warrant.It seems clear that, notwithstanding the new Warrant, there will continue to be many cases of serious hardship to which public sentiment will insist that assistance shall be given and the question will be to what extent the State will provide a fund to meet such cases.Ad matters now stand; the Statutory Committee have pro-posed to the Treaoury that the Committee ohould use tho  1.000,000 grant for those and other purposes and that the whole subject of financial provision should be reviewed before Slot December, 1918.It would now be convenient to consider the effect of the new Warrant upon the Regulations of the Committee under the main headings bearing- in mind the general observations contained in the previous paragraphs.
SUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS, Supplementary pensions to Widows.The system of alternative pensions must obviously cancel the Committee*-s regulations.     It is evident that in the majority of the oases the new Warrant is more favourable to the widow than the supplementary pension Regulations.     At the same time the operation of the new -scale may leave a residum of oases where owing to the existence of special oiroumstances of hardship the provision under the new Warrant will be inadequate. If it be admitted that cases of hardship will arise, the remedy, If left to the Statutory Committee, must be by way of a special allowance to meet special oiroumstanoeo;   it would not be fitting that there should be any scheme of supplementation of general application to widpwa.It should be pointed out that the alternative pension in limited to those widows who were married before the war or before the date of the man&apos;o enlistment;    a widow who married after the husband&apos;s enlistment has to be content with a minimum pension but she is not precluded under the Committee *s Regula-tlons from receiving a supplementary pension although it ic suggested in the Instructions (paragraph     ) that &quot;widows who married after or very shortly before the husband&apos;3 enlistment chould not as a rule be regarded as eligible for the supplemen-tary pension, but it ic recognised that there may be 3peoial circumstances in certain cases which would justify a local Committee in recommending a grant&quot;,SUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS TO DEPENDANTS.There is no alternative pension provided for In the case of dependants and even if a mother had fceen wholly dependent upon her son and her dependence was as much aa  2 a week she can only
received 15/- a week;    the increase in the flat rate of State pension will certainly reduce substantially the number of cases which would otherwise have called for consideration under the supplementary pension regulations, but these have not been supe seded in the same sense as those relating to the widow or the disabled man, and there would seem to be good reason for the continuanoo of action,by the Statutory Committee on the supple-mentary lines.(i) Wholly dependent paront -   Under Regulation 1^ the wholly dependent parent can receive by way of State and supple-mentary pension as much as 30/- a week but the limit of pension under the new Warrant is 15/- a week.(ii) Partly dependent parent -   The new Warrant does not distinguish between the wholly dependent and the partly depend-ent parent so that the supplementary pension would be more favourable in the latter case only ..;here the &quot;earning capacity&quot; and other income did not exceed 15/- a week.   Thus if the pre-war dependence was 40/- and earning capacity and other income was computed at 12/6, under the new Warrant the maximum income would be 27/6 whereas the supplementary pension would make income up to 30/-.(iii) Other dependants -   Under Regulation 12 a total pension, State and supplementary, of 20/- a week is possible for &quot;other dependants&quot;.   These dependants include relatives (formerly known as Class A) and unmarried wives (Class B).The maximum pension under the new Warrant is 5/- for Class A and 10/- with children&apos;s allowances for Glass B.POST l^AR D5r3ffD3NC5 Under Article 21 (2) of the new Warrant the parents of a soldier who at the commencement of the war was an apprentice or a student can receive an allowance of not exceeding 16/- a week if wholly or partly incapable of self support from infirmity or age.   In these cases there would have been no dependence and(6)
noroover there is no limit of timo after tho death of the soldierduring frtiick an application may bo made.     In tho case of theAustralian Commonwealth Act tho period fixed was 5 years and tho(statutory Committee thought that 7 yoars would be a reasonable jperiod.It will be observed that tho pensions are limited to the parent or parents of apprentices and students;   other dependants are rightly excluded.     There is no provision for the parents ef other soldiers where thero was no pro-war dependence.   Some pro-vision appears necessary for cases where thero was dependence sub-sequent to onlistmont although the conditions safeguarding the grant of allowances in such cases noed careful consideration.Supplementary pensions to disabled men. Socing that under Regulation 16 the totally disabled man cannot receive a larger pension, State and Supplementary than 50/*-a week, and a partially disabled man 40/- a week less the amount of his earning capacity, the new Warrant, by providing a pension or pension and earning capacity of the full amount of pre-war earnings up to 50/- and 50y0 of tho pro-war oarnings bctwoon 50/- and 100/-is clearly more favourable to tho man.   There may be a residuum of hard cases as amongst widows but such cases arc not added to by the substitution of tho now Warrant for tho supplementary pension Regulations.Supplementary pensions to motherless Children.Under Regulation approved by the Statutory Committee onUth December but not yot sanctioned by the Treasury a supplemen-tary pension may bo given which together vdth the State pensionuay amount in the case of -Children maintained in Institutions 10/- a weekChildren in caro of relative or guardian   lc/- &quot;   &quot;foi1 ono child and 7/6 for each child more than one Tho maximum in the new Warrant is 7/- for the firstchild and 6/- for oach of any others maintained by the same personand the Article does not apply in any cases bolow tho &quot;Substan-- :tially aggravated&quot;.
The new Warrant goes &quot;beyond supplementary ponsions and by allowing pensions in casos where hitherto no State ponsion has &quot;been granted considerably reduces the number of cases Calling for special (temporary) allowances under Regulation 27.     It doos not, however, cover the latter.     There is the group of depend-ants1 oases comprised in 27 fl) which are not provided for, 1*0. oases where a special separation allowance had been paid.The disqualifying circumstances for a special (tempor-ary) allowance under Regulation 27 (2) are tho unworthinoss of the applicant, the unsatisfactory service of the man concerned, or the fact that the death or disablement of the man was not due to ciroumstancos arising from service during the war.The oases must also be thoee which could be considered for a special allowance of a continuing nature although the temporary allowance could only &quot;be awarded in the Sirst instance for 26 weeks or until the coming into force of a new Regulation.The new Warrant apparently does not extend to accidont ccsos or oases of death or disablement whilst on leave or off duty.    The number of oases which will require to be dealt with by the Committee depends largely upon the administration of the Warrants by the Ministry of Pensions.     The tendency in reoont months has beon towards a more liberal interpretation of the Warrants.     Speoial points arising in regard to the various classes are as follows(i) Widows - A widow whose husband died from disease aggravated (not substantially aggravated) by service would be entitled under the new Warrant to a temporary pension of 10/ - a week for a period of the war and for 12 months afterwards.question will be whether in circumstances of distress an allowance should be granted for a further period.Dependants - The new Warrant makes no provision for oases below those of the &quot;substantially aggravated&quot; class
and therefore the Regulation is only partly superseded, viz, in so far as the &quot;substantially aggravated&quot; cases aro oovere,&apos; by Article 21 and 22,(iii) Viwble^men. - Article 2 (2) should bo set against Regulation 27 (2) (a) (iii).     She Regulation provides for an allowance of 20/- a week if separation allowance had been issued to a wife or dependant, together with allowances for children, or 10/- a week if no such separation allowance had &quot;been issued.     The Article provides for a gratuity or temporary allowance but the total must not exceed  100 and exceptional circumstances must prevail if that sum is granted.(iv) Children-- (other than those coming under (i) and (iii) - The limitations in the new Warrant referred to under fii) above apply in the case of these children.MIS CIIiLLANB OU 3 A LI OWAHQE 3 AID  RANTS.Widows.Training grant - Statutory Committee on 14th December, 1916, approved a Regulation provided for a grant of  50 for fees and expenses incidental to training, but this Regulation has not yet received the sanction of the Treasury.Article 14 (3) provides for the payment of fees and an allowance of 12/6 for a period not ordinarily exceeding 13 weeks during training.     Under the Regulations of the Committee the increased earning capacity of the widow resulting- from such training would have operated to reduce the amount of the supplementary pension, but this is not the case under tho new Warrant.     It seems clear that the Committee^ Regulation must to regarded as superseded.gratuity on husband&apos;s death.- The  3 given in certain oases under Regulation 13(e) Part II is made general under Article 14 (1) cf new Warrant, and the Committee^ Regulation is superseded thereby.
Appendix II.&apos;PROCEEDINGS OP CONFERENCE WITH STATUTORY ADVISERS,THURSDAY 22ND MARCH 1917.Present.Mr. Barnes.Dr. MacnamaraMr. Forster.Mr. Hayes Fisher.Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen.Attended.Sir Fredk. Stopford,3ir Matthew Nathan.Mir. Sann-er.Mr. Wynne.In connection with the men&apos;s Warrant Dr. Macaamara &quot;brought up two points.       The first was the question of appeal, and he advocated that very careful consideration should be given to the proposal to alloy/ an appeal to an independent body in cases where it was decided at Chelsea that the disablement was neither attributable to nor aggravated by military servioo.     He did not however press for anything to be done pending experience as to the administration of the New Warrant.       The second point was the elimination of the word &quot;substantially&quot; in Articles 9 and 11 and he was told that this had already been deoided on.The Articles of the draft Warrant for Officers were discussed one by one and the following decisions were come to.Article 1. (1).       A scale was to be drawn up to indicate the degrees of disablement according to the men!s Warrant, which would bo equilavent to the terms   totally destroyed&quot;, &quot;seriously affected&quot;, and &quot;Impaired&quot;, hitherto adopted with regard to Officers and the wording of paragraph of Article 1 (1) was to be modified accordingly.
Article 2.(2).   The question&apos;of retireddisablement was to be discussed before the next Meeting with representatives of the Admiralty and War Office.Article 1.(5),   The question of wounds pensions for Officers raised that of the continuance of disablement pensions for men who had rejoined for service during the present War, and it was agreed that cases in which these pensions had ceased wouAd have to be re-considered if applications were made with regard to them*Tho proposed sub-section was agreed to with regard to Officers.Article 1.(4),     It was agreed that if a disabled Officer was already in receipt of pen-sion or retired pay, he should relinquish the same if granted a higher rate under the New Warrant.Article 1.(5),     It was agreed that tho existing provision for an Officer who had lost the sight of both eyes should stand with tho omission of tho restriction as to the loss of sight occurring within five years after th:,-wound causing itArticle 2.     It was considered that the children1s allowances in &quot;seriously affected&quot; and &quot;Impaired&apos;&apos; cases should depend on. tho percentage proportion that thes.; disablementg bore to total destruction of earning capacity. Children&apos;s allowances, unlike educational allowances-t wore to be granted irrespective of pecuniary used.Articles
Articles 2.(2),2.(3), and 2.(4).    These Articles     * ^ * dealing with children&apos;s allowances were agreed to, Dr. Macnamara concurring in thefe view that nominal wages should mean wagos of less than 10/- per week.-Article 3.     The proposals with regard to alternative retired pay for disabled Officers were agreed to. (The alternative pensions in the case of &quot;seriously affected&quot; and Impaired&quot;&apos; cases will have to be considered in connection with the proportion of &quot;total., disablement&quot; that these terms are taken to represent).--..Article 4.     The proposal with regard to temporary award to disabled officers was agreed to.Article 5.     The proposals as to undergoing treatment were agreed to.Article 6.     The proposed grants to disabled Officers undergoing treatment wereagreed to, except that it was decided that the alternative of a  70 . allowance to a bling man irftierP the constant attention of a second person is necessary, or the giving as now of a- 300 gratuity to a blind man without any addition    j for attendance, to. be put to Sir Arthur &quot;Pearson..Article 7.     The proposed grants to disabled officers undergoing&apos; training   were agreed to..Article -8.  :. The proposed gratuities to . disabled officers, slightly impaired, were agreed to.Article 9,     The proposed gratuities to officers for disablement not attributable to nor aggravated by military service were agreed to, subject to an increase from  200 to  300 of the amount -co be granted in special cases. .

Appendix ill.WAJB. PENSIONS &amp;o., STATUTORY COMMITTEE.REPORT TO !PH3 PENSIONS MINISTER. Por week ending 21st March., 1917.ORGANIZATION BRANCH.A separate Local Committee has been formed at Portadown (County Armagh) and is now in operation.Extraots from reports of Inspectors, As regards disabled soldiers in Rothorham, ninety oaseshave been notified but less than thirty have applied for help..Suitable work has been found in every case,     There has beon onlyone case of training and this has turned out very satisfactory.There have beon many cases of men transferred to Class W. Reserve,their cases have beon taken up with tho Army Authorities.As regards Pensions and Allowances.     The Looal Committoohas no fault to find with the way in which these are now beingissued.Our Inspeotor in Ireland reports regarding Belfast Ltcal Committee that the organization and administrative work are good and that he was much impressed with the manner in which tho staff, voluntary workers, otc, carry on the business.     All cases seom to be thoroughly investigated and the Regulations adhered to as closely as possible.It is hopod to start a Training Institute in the wing of the Orthopaedic Hospital so as to train and find employment for these cases.
Regarding West Bromwioh Local Committee, a oarefnl list of the discharged and disablod men notified to tho Committee is kept.     All men upon discharge immediately find work, for which very good wages are paid,     Ta:- relations between the4employers of labour and the Trade Union Officials are iriendly in the extreme, both combining very generously in the discharged soldiers interests.Notwithstanding their disability the men are well paid no matter in what jjarticular branch of trado they enter, but th3 good wages to be obtained are acting as a serious hindrance to the men accepting offers of training.     The Inspector was assured they prefer unskilled wages to the offer made to them for training in skilled trades,This Committee is reported to be working on very good . lines, there is careful home visiting and verification before relief is  -iven and when given, it is strictly in accordance with the Regulations.In Southanrpton it is reported that the present feoling of certain Trade Unions is not to admit men who have received short training under the Committee&apos;s Schemes and even though fully qualified, to debar thorn from equal benefits with Trade Union men who havo served apprenticeships.Our Inspector reports that Smcthwick local Committee havo a complete register for discharged mon notified to them, irractically every one is absorbed in his old place of employment. 3?he men will not accept offers of training, preferring high rates of wages to bo obtained in tho district.They have an excellently equipped Technical College and the Principal would gladly meet the disabled men in every way possible, but so far there has been no response.   The Labour -tarty here have created an organization for ths xruxposc of
looking after the interests of disabled men.     They hold meeting, at which the public and -disabled men are specially urged to attend.     The Local Committee is giving them a list of all disabled men in response to thoir appear but tho Inspector protests against this action and considers that the treatment of disabled soldiers should be kept exclusively in the hands of the Local Committee, tho reason being that he sees in other places a grave danger of disabled soldiers being used for political purposes.Our Inspector reporting on the Birmingham Local Committee states that there are 29 District Committees and tho work performed by the various Committees naturally varies.    So far as tho Central Officers and the Local Committee are concerned, everything that oan be done, he is satisfied, Is done to keep a very high standard of work and to onsuro that the Regulations aro strictly carried out.In spito of its huge dimensions the work is well in hand and completely controlled from the Central Committee *DISABLEMENTS BRANCH,The Training and Employment Section report as follows:-The Scheme for training submitted by tho Local Committee for Leeds has not boon proceeded with further, as the Local Committee report that men arc easily placed in employment and there arc not sufficient men to justify special courses of training being started.     The Section have concurred with this view..The Scheme submitted by the Welsh Town Planning and Housing Trust Ltd., for training centres at Cardiff and Wroxham have been submitted to the Local Committee for Cardiff and Glamorgan,, and to Wrexham respectively, requesting thoir views
jon the proposals.The Leith Local Committee have been considering proposals for Training and Smployment and have sought the advice of the Section on the question.       They suggest co-operation with other Local Committees in the neighbourhood, in which suggestion the Section have concurred.The first Trade Advisory Committee has met during the week with reference to the Basket-making Industry and the report on the trade will be issued as soon as possible.The Section have received reports from 120 large ipirms, principally in the Engineering and Ship-building Industries, upon their experience in employing partially disabled discharged sailors and soldiers in their works, and offering to employ a further number of men if suitably selected.The collated reports shew that where there has been sympathetic management the employment of discharged sailors and soldiers has been, on the whole, fairly successful.       They have been employed in Engineering Works chiefly as attendants at lathes, drilling, milling, grinding and automatic machines; gatemen, liftmen, timekeepers, assemblers, telephone and lavatory attendants, clerks and checkers..        In a number of cases they propose to take&apos; selected men, train them over a period of time as crane drivers, machine attendants, &amp;c., clerks, storekeepers etc,    / and then employ them.i-Vhere failure in employing these men is reported they state the men are Irregular and very bad timekeepers, unreliable and leave as soon as they have a knowledge of the work in order to improve their positions.
Further reports of this nature will he collected from time to time and collated.PENSIONS BRANCH.Of the individual cases considered during the week there is none which calls for special comment.1.2.FINANCE SUB-COMMITTEEiu *Total advances to Local Committees.2,450.182. 10. 6. 106.    9. 10. 4 00.    8.    4.Other expenditure Temporary Grants Educational   &quot; Salaries &amp; aages Travelling Expenses &amp;c. of Inspectors.     168. 12.
