This Document is the property of Bis Britannic Majesty $ Government.EXPLANATORY  NOTES.1. New Formations. The Viceroy&apos;?, last telegram showed that the 13 new battalions were 2,000 men short of completion. The present telegram shows that they are now 1,750 men short. The.Government of India expect to raise the Labour Corps for France at the rate of 6,000 men per mensem, and have asked for only four officers for employment with the 10 Labour Corps, and these four officers will be despatched at the.end of this month.In addition to the 171,000 new rifles (1914 pattern) with which the War . Office will supply India,/the War Office propose to leave in India the rifles of the 12 Territorial Battalions which are to be sent from India to Egypt. Further 10,000 S.M.L.E. service rifles are being sent to Mesopotamia (probably by the end of March as the rifles have been allotted out of the output of this month) for exchange with older patterns. The rifles so released will be available for units in India.52 .18 pdrs. and 3G 2&apos;75-inch guns are still owing to India. It is hoped that the 18 pdrs. will be despatched by the end of July, but this depends upon the Avastage in France. The 2&apos; 75-inch guns should be available for despatch at the rate of 12 a month, commencing in April.The whole of the - equipment asked for by the Government of India has^ been despatched.42 &quot; Star &quot; lorries were asked for by the Government of India, and these have all been despatched.The two&apos; remaining Garrison Battalions to be sent to India should leave the United Kingdom about 20th March.Approximately 8,000 drafts arc awaiting passage; the figure includes 4,600 due as special reinforcements for the 14 British battalions allotted to the Field Army, amounting to 8 per cent, per mensem for three months&apos; wastage.   Approximately 0,000 should sail about the 20th March.Twenty-three officers have been asked for. Of these live have already sailed and 13 are awaiting embarkation in France.The main difficulty which the War Office finds in meeting quickly the requirements of the Government of India is lack of shipping.2 and 3. Munitions and Supplies.-Until the question .of Indians possible local resources can be comprehensively considered by the Munitions Board in collaboration with manufacturers the Government cannot say definitely what supplies now made for Mesopotamia or India from Imperial sources can be arranged for in India; but every endeavour is being made to increase local production and the resulting modification, possible in home demands will be communicated when known. Some direct demands have been made without the knowledge of the Government of India upon Egypt for articles which India could have supplied, and arrangements are now being made which will prevent this in future.Sir F. W. Black with his assistants from the Ministry of Munitions whp are to help the Government of India to organise the resources of India for% war purposes have now left for India.4. Internal Condition.-The &quot; War Loan &quot; referred to (in. the penulti-malie line of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram) is the Indian War Loan, consisting of (1) a 5 per cent, issue repayable 1929-47 ; (2) 51 per cent, bonds repayable 1920 and 1922. &quot;The loan is without limit of amount.

On the other hand, recruiting for Imperial Service Troops has been&apos; disappointing in Hyderabad in spite of bounties offered by Nizam of Hyderabad, and in Alwar rumour that compulsion would be used led to temporary excitement
amongst the Meos, a local Mohammadan tribe. Other States also are finding it difficult to obtain recruits for their Indian service units. The provisions of the Indian Defence Act have been variously received by Indian Press, some papers giving them a hearty welcome and calling upon Indians to volunteer, other papers emphasising racial discrimination, in the matter of pay, commissions, &amp;c. The various agitations already mentioned continue. Budget proposals and the War Loan have on the whole been well received. The lull in political crime in Bengal has been broken by a small dacoity.Note.
