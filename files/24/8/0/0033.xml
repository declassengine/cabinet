Memorandum.:By tho Summer Time Act, 1916, it was provided as follows:-&quot;1.- (l) During the presoribed period in each.year in which this Act is in force, &quot;the time for general purposes in Great Britain shall be one hour in advance of &quot;Greenwich mean time.^&quot;(2) This Aot shall be in force in ^the year nineteen hundred and sixteen, &quot;and in that year tho presoribed period on^uid. be from two o&apos;olook in the morning* &quot;ftreonwieh mean time on Sunday the twenty-first day of May until two o,olook in the &quot;morning Greenwich mean time on Sunday tho first day of Ootober, and His Majesty &quot;may in any subsequent year by Order in Counoil made during the continuance of the ^present war, doolare this A*t to be in force during that year, and in such case the &quot;prescribed period in that year shall be such period as may be fixed by the Order in &quot;Council.*&quot;(4) This Act shall apply to Ireland in like manner as it applies to Great &quot;Britain, with the substitution, however, of references to Dublin mean time for refer-&quot;onces to Greenwich moan time.&quot;The Timo (Ireland) Act. 1916, repealed the words &quot;in Great Britain&quot; in Section f i) of the above Aot and subseotion (4) of the same Section and provided as follows:-&quot;1.- As from two o&apos;olook in the morning, Dublin mean time on Sunday tho first &quot;day of Ootober nineteen hundred and sixteen the time for general purposes in Ireland &quot;shall be the same as the time for general purposes in Great Britain both during the &quot;periodB when the Summer Tine Aott 1916, is in fortre and at all other times,&quot;The late Home Secretary appointed a Committee (over which the Right Hon. J.W, ison, M,P. presided) to inquire into the&apos;working of the Summer Time Act, 1916, and to nsider whether and on what oonditions Summer Timo should be reintroduoed.   The Oommitte 1 tho 22nd February,1916, presented their Report and thereby recommended as follows:-i. That Summer Time should be renewed in 1917 and in subsequent years, ii. That the period of the operation of Summer Time should be from the second Sunday in April to the, third Sunday in September in each year.iii. That tho change from normal to Summer Timo should be made on the night of Saturday - Sunday and the reversion to normal time on the night of Sunday - Monday.iv. That the variation from normal time should be one hour throughout the whole Dsriod.The Committee dealt speoially with the case of Ireland, where they reported that nion was divided, the very large majority of town dwellers being in favour of *&apos;9r Time while the bulk of agricultural opinion was opposed to it.   The following acts from the Report which refer to this question may be given hero.
&quot;It is not easy to see, at first sight, why so much more inconvenience &quot;should have been experienced by&quot;farmers in Ireland than in the rest of tho &quot;United Kingdom, though it ,was pointed out to us that particularly heavy &quot;dews are experienced in that Country in the early mornings; and some part of &quot;the explanation would also seem to lie in the circumstance which is mention-&quot;od in       number of the replies-, viz:- difficulty in getting labourers to &quot;consent to changes in the working hoursj in particular they seem to have &quot;objected to working after six oTclock in the evening.     So far as we are &quot;aware, this latter difficulty has-&quot; not appeared to any appreciable extent &quot;outside Ireland, and we certainly do not think it should be regarded as &quot;insuperable.........&quot;When the question is considered whether Summer Time is to be applied to &quot;Ireland for the future, it must of course be borne in mind that since October &quot;last the time in Ireland has been permanently advanced&apos;by 25 minutes owing &quot;to thft substitution of Greenwich for Dublin Time by the Time (Ireland) Act, &quot;1916;   so that in the event of Summer Time being applied to Ireland in the ^same way as we have recommended above for the rest of the United Kingdom, &quot;the advanoe would be twenty-five minutes in excess *f what was experienced &quot;last year.      This consideration is very much in the minds of those who are. &quot;not favourably disposed towards the  renewal of Summer Time in Ireland;   in &quot;fact, it would seem to be in many oases the principal ground of opposition.&quot;We think, however, that its significance oan easily be exaggerated.   It &quot;may be noticed, in the first place that, so far as &quot;Summer Time&quot; is concerned &quot;Dublin and the East of Ireland are only a few minutes ahead of the West of &quot;England, Wales and Sootland.    Moreover, thoro would be more ground for appre-&quot;hension if it were proposed to begin Summer Time very early in the Spring, &quot;or to oontinue it late into the Autumn.     In point cf faot, as has been seen, &quot;we have recommended, largely with Ireland.In view, that Summer Time should &quot;end on the third Sunday in September, i.e. at the latest on the 21st September &quot;instead of on the 30th   as was the. case last year; and that it should begin &quot;on the second Sunday in April, i.e. between the 8th and the 14th April in-&quot;elusive, when the days are no shorter than at the beginning of September.&quot;The Committee inoluded two Irish Members, viz:-   Sir J. B. Lonsdale and Sir W, Nugent.^Since the publication of the Report, I have received representations fromIreland both for and against Summer Time, in Ireland may be summarized as follows:-The opinions of the local authoritiesCounties Rural Districts, Urban Districts County BoroughsFavourablev 83160. 3Against17-137 181Neutral1-11 4
A deputation of 43 Members of Parliament representing Irish agricultural constituencies had   an interview with the Chief Secretary for Ireland and my-self and asked that Summer Time should not be applied to Ireland.On the other hand the railway authorities appear to be strongly opposed to any distinction being made between Great Britain and Ireland, the General Manager of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland stating that &quot;the immediate effect will be more or less a complete dislocation of Irish train services whioh are largely built of mail steamer connections.&quot;     The Postmaster General states that from the Post Office point of view any differentiation between English and Irish time would entail a large amount of inconvenience and labour as it would myan a oompleto recasting of the Irish postal servioes every time there was a change in the English clock-time and Irish clock-time.I ma? add that there is considerable doubt, in view of the provision of tho Time  Ireland) Act, 1916, that the time in Ireland 6hall be the same as the time in Great Britain &quot;both during the periods when the Summer Time Act, 1916, is in forco and at all other times&quot;, whether any differentiation can be made without new legislation.I annex a minute by the Chief Seoretary for Ireland.UpoR the whole I think that the balance of argument is in favour of uniform-ity throughout the United Kingdom.The authorities of the Church of England have pointed out that if the ihange is made on the morning of the 8th April (Easter Sudday), considerable inconvenience will be caused to those who hold or attend the early morning services, and suggest that the first or third Sunday in April might be sutstituted. in the other hand, the selection of an earlier Sunday would accentuate the Irish Ejection to any change, and the postponement of Summer Time until a later Sunday would meet with objection from the Board of Agriculture who desire that he change shall be made as early as possible.     I think it will be better to ihere to the date selected by the Committee, which has already been made public.I submit a draft Order in Council for bringing Summer Time into operation fctneen the dates and for the period reoommended by the Committee.0.C.21.3,1917.MINUTE BY THE CHIEF SECRETARY gQR IRELAND.^oretary:I find opinion in Ireland hopelessly divided with regard to the renewed ^cation of Summer Time in this Country under the Act passed last year.The whole practically of the agricultural population, i.e. an overwhelm-
ing majority numerically, desire that Summer Time should not be imposed.     The urban popvlation and the oommercial classes generally wish that it should.The dislocation of transit arrangements by the introduction of a different of one hour between English and Irish time would be disadvantageous.Advisers in whom I have confidence consider that the inconvenienoe to the agriculturists will be overcome in practice,     I. think this is probably a oorreot view.You need to consider, I think, whether there should be a short Bill this year to empower His Majesty in Council to suspend or modify the operation of the Act in case neoessity for such a oourse should appear, or whether some promise tc take steps for avoiding inconvenience shall be taken if neoessity appears,I oan only say further that an Irish Parliament, if such a body were in existente, oould not at present introduce Summer Time here.H.E.D.17.3.1917.DRAFT ORDER IN COUNCIL.AT THE COURT.AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE,the day of 1917.PRESENTThe King1a Most Excellent Majesty in CounoilWHEREAS by the Summer Time Aot, 1916, as amended by the Time (Ireland) Aot, 1916, it is provided that during the presoribod period in each year in which the former Aot iB in foroe, the time for general purposes is to be one hour in advaneoj of Greenwich mean time; and it is further provided that His Majesty may in any year subsequent to the year nineteen hurjred and sixteen by Order in Council made during the ocntinuanoe of tho present war deolare the former Aot to be in force during that year,&apos; and in such case the presoribed period for that year shall be suoh period as may be fixed by Order in Council,NOW therefore His Majesty is pleased by and with the advice of His Privy Counoil to deolare, and it is hereby declared, that the Summer Time Act, 1916, as so amended as aforesaid shall be in force during the year nineteen hundred ani seventeen, and the presoribed period in that year shall be from two o&apos;wlook in the morning Greenwich mean time on Sunday the eighth day of April until two o&apos;clook in the morning Greenwioh mean time on Monday the twenty-fourth day of September.
