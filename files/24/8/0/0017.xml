SECRETNOTE BY.THE SECRETARY. (Paper No, G.T.217.)In circulating this Report of a joint Admiralty and War Office Conference on INVASION, attention is drawn to the fact that the Conference do not appear to have pressed &quot;Lord Pisher to explain fully the grounds on which his apprehensions were based.&quot; as suggested by the War Cabinet.It is for consideration whether the Yfar Cabinet should not themselves hear what Lord Eisher has to say on the matter.(Sgd)   M.P.A.HANKEY.-      - . .2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 20th March 1917.
BE OR E T. WAR CABINET.(See War Cabinet 9? (3) )G.T-217A Conference was held in the Room of the Secretary of State for War at 3.45 p.m. on the 16th March 1917.PRESENT.Secretary of State for War.First Lord of the Admiralty.Eiret Sea Lord of the Admiralty.Chief of the Admiralty War Staff.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Director of Military Operations.Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces.Chief of the General Staff, Home Forces.1.     The Secretary of State for War stated that the Conference was held at the request of the War Cabinet in consequence of a communication on &quot;the subject of the invasion of Great Britain which the Prime Minister had received from Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Fisher.2.     The First Sea Lord stated that in view of Naval develop-ments the Admiralty desired to review the conclusion (ii) of the &quot;Report of a Conference between representatives of the Admiralty War Staff and the General Staff held to consider the possibility of an attack on the United Kingdom, August 9th, 1916&quot; and to. extend the time within which the enemy&apos;e landing operations could be effectively interrupted from the original estimate of from 24 - 28 hours after the hostile transports were sighted from the shore, to from 32 to 36 hours after the hostile transports had been sighted from the shore.3..     The Admiralty representative stated that the enemy still had sufficient shipping to transport 160,000 men to these shores and the CI.C-.S. stated that the enemy would still be able, to find that number of troops for the purpose of invasion, more especially as he is now increasing the number of his divisions in Belgium.4.     The Admiralty representatives further stated that while invasion was possible they did not consider that from a Naval point of view it was probable in view of the grave risks which the enemy must run.The First Sea Lord stated that in his opinion the probability of a beach landing was remote as the risks involved were very great, and the C.I.G.S. added that the feasibility of landing a force of 160,000 men within 36 hours depended upon the enemy being able to use the beaches.5.     The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chiel^ Home Forces, stated that the military aspect of the question was that the defences on the coast were now in a far better condition to meet invasion than they were a year ago, and that in particular the number of machine guns available at home, which was an important factor in the question, was much greater;   on the other hand, the number of mobile troops immediately at thedisposal.
disposal of the Field-Marshal for Home Defence was, as a result of the War Cabinet decision of the 22nd January last, about 6C,000 below his estimated requirements to meet an invasion by 160,000 men, and the quality of a considerable portion of his Divisions was poor.    There was also the question of Ireland to be considered..6.     The Conference after hearing the above expression of opinion decided that the question of the number of troops to be maintained in Great Britain to meet invasion was one of balancing the advantages of strengthening our oversea forces as against the risk, of invasion, and could only be decided by the War&apos; Cabinet after periodical review of the general situation.At the present time there is only one Devision at Home which could be sent abroad.     It is now being prepared and will be ready in about a months&apos; time.      The advisability of its despatch should then be considered by the War Cabinet,(Intld)      E.C.D FJ&quot;. R. J&quot;.
