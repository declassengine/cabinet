,^17 3tlxS E C R E..T. G.T. 239.WAR .GABIHET. OUTPUT OP TANKS(Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions.)With reference to E.M.O&apos;s Memorandum of March 5th. 1917,  on the Output of Tanks,  I have the following remarks to offer -1.     The Tanks first came into action on September 15th. 1916.2.-    As stated in 1,3.0&apos;s Memorandum,  a provisional demand for 1,000 additions! Tanks was received from the War Office on October 14th. 1916.   A provisional order of this nature was needed in order to maintain continuity of manufacture of engines until the new design of Tank was completepy settled.At this period discussions were taking place with the General Staff in France with a view to inccrpcrat-ing a number of improvements in the design cf the Tanks, suggested by the experience gained from their use in action The representatives of the Ministry were informed that the Tank, at the stage in development which it had then reached,  was of little or no value as a fighting unit.3. On November 23rd.. a conference was held betweenrepresentatives of the&apos; Ministry of Munitions,  the YPir Office, neavy Branch (France) and Heavy Branch (England) and,  after lengthy discussions,  the general type if Tank required&apos; was finally decided upen.   Fresh drawings, had to be prepared and were generally completed within six weeks.    From this,  it will be seen that the design for the now Mark PA/ Tank were not&apos; ready till practically the end
-2-and of December, and that,  to securo delivery of these machines &quot;by M&quot;.reh, it would have been necessary that there should be no interruption or delay in the supply of both raw materials and labour.4.     As regards the labour required to carry out thru pro-gramme ; it was considered at the time when the order for the additional 1,000 Tgnke was first given, that it would be necessary for the manufacturers to employ about 3,000 addi-tional hands, of whom 1,000 - 1,400 could be women,     It was further considered that Messrs. Daimler would require the recall of about 200 specially skilled men from the Colours to give the rr?quired output of engines, and the necessity for releasing these men was urged upon the Army Council.     The Ministry also stated that no hope could be held out of meeting the large programme put before them unless they secured the active support of the War Office Authorities in protecting the labouA of firms engaged in manufacturing very urgent, war material,5.       Unfortunately, owing to the pressure put upon the Ministry of Munitions to release as many men as possible from munition works for service in the Army, it has not been possible to supply the labour required in sufficient quantity, It has &quot;only been possible to obtain about 300 out of the 2,000 men which it was estimated would be required and I am informed that in some ^ases skilled men have been recruited for tho Army from firms       engaged in &apos;       work
i?ork connected with the manufacture of Tanks.It is hoped that means have been discovered for obtaining some of the necessary labour, through the employment of military working parties.   The fact needs to be emphasised, however, that the failure to reach the estimates originally given for the output of Tanks is In the main due to lack of the necessary labour,6.     The requirements both for labour and material for the manufacture of Tanks have always enjoyed a very high priority classification.     Until a few weeks ago the highest possible pr&amp;$rity was given, but at a Conference held early in February ;.ith r ep re sent at isms from G.E.Q., it was stated quite definitely that the supply of aeroplanes in the first place and in the second place the manufacture and repair of guns must take precedence of Tanks.    Since that date therefore the demands for the manufacture of Tanks have not been in quite so privileged a position as they were before, although they still rank higher than anything else ex cept aeroplanes and guns and have always been specially marked in the class entitled to P.l. Priority.7,     While dealing with the question of priority, I might add that An the Clyde the supply of some of the larger stampings for Tanks has apparelntly been interfered with by the Admiralty programme for the building of standard ships.     This is a question of relative priority that does not rest with the Ministry of&quot;Munitions.8.       I fully agree with the M.G.O. that it is in the highest/
highest degree important that the estimates supplied to the Commander-in-Chief should he as reliable as possible, and that forecasts of the rate of delivery should err, if they err at all, in the direction of being too conservative, and I regret that the early optimistic estimates were supplied.   At the present moment, the uncertain factors of labour, materials and railway transport render it particularly difficult to make reliable estimates of delivery of complex munitions such as Tanks, in which the various parts are manufactured in a large number of widely separated workshops.    Any delay in the supply of a single part involves a corresponding delay in the output of the c omple t e d mac hine.9. It may be pointed out in conclusion that250 Tanks of Marks I, II, and III, have already been delivered and that the break in the continuity of outputis due entirely to the changes in design ren-dered necessary by the experience gained in the actual use of the Tank as a fighting machine.    It is barely four months since the experience thus gained was rendered available for the purposes of manufacture.I might also add that although the period-ical official estimates supplied to the War Office may haveshown some considerable divergences, the officials of the Ministry responsible for. the supply of Tanks have been in constant communication with G.H.Q. through General Butler, and have kept him fully Informed of the prospects of delivery from tine to time.Christopher Addison. 21.3.17.
