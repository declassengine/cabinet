G RET.,T - 219.WAR CABINET iLIQUOR RESTRICTIONS.Memorandum by Sir George Cave as to Progress.As requested by War Cabinet 77 (Minute 5) I formed a Committee to consider the position created by the proposed restrictions on the output cf beer, such Committee includ-ing five representatives of 11the Trade.&quot; The Committee also considered the restrictions on vanes- and spirits, and received a nurrber of deputations on both subjects.The Committee are satisfied that the restrictions on the output of beer will cause inequality in the supply of beer in different places and considerable pecuniary loss to the Trade.   Breweries will be closed,  debenture holders will exercise their remedies,  and licensed houses will be in danger of losing their licenses.    The goodwill of a closed brewery or licensed house will pass to others,  plant will deteriorate,  and the status quo ante cannot be restored after the- war.    It is.  therefore,  desirable to take some steps for preventing unnecessary confusion and. loss.An attempt was made by the&apos; Committee to induce the beer trade to agree to a system of economical trade management and pooling of profits under Government control.    The licen-sees- of public houses appeared to favour the scheme, but a majority of the brewers were opposed to it.    It therefore became necessary to consider the alternatives,  viz.,  complete State control during the war or State purchase.Immediate State control of 100,000 public and many breweries presents great difficulties.&apos;    It would be impossi-ble without an enormous staff efficiently to control so many concerns at once; and if the control were left to the present traders,   stock-in -trade and profits could not be safeguarded.State purchase requires legislation and cannot there-fore be carried through before the 1st April.    Opinion among brewers is divided upon this question,  the large brewers being generally opposed to purchase while some of the small brew-ers would welcome it.    The Irish licensees are willing to en-tertain a proposal for purchase while those in Great Britain vigorously object to it.    The Committee includes interested persons and cannot well be asked, to pronounce an opinion upon this question.As to spirits,  the distillers have ceased,or will short-ly cease,  to make potable spirits, and the distribution of the available stocks can be controlled by the new Order-.    As to wines,  the position may be affected by International con.-ditions, but with these -the Committee are not concerned. Difficulties for working cut the Order as to wines and spirits have,  it is believed,  been, solved in the course of the dis--cusslons.   -
In the circumstances, the Committee will probably recommend :-(l)    That certain regulations imposing the proposed restrictions shall be made under the Defence of the Realm Acts (these are in course of prepara-ti on).(2)    That the War Cabinet do come to a decision on the question of purchase and make an announcement.(3)   That if the Cabinet decide to purchase,  the terms be referred to three Committees dealing respect-ively with England and Wales,- Scotland and Ireland;A full report will be presented in the course of t- isweek.
