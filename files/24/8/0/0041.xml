[This Bnmiment is the Property of His Britemit Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   March 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.3   ;l 314SvAv - AREPORT OF THE HOME OFFICE COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO ENQUIRE INTO THE POSITION CREATED BY THE APPROVED RESTRICTIONS ON THE OUTPUT OF BEER, SPIRITS, AND WINES.1. THE Committee was constituted as follows : The Home Secretary (Chairman). The Attorney-General for Ireland. Mr. A. Clavell Salter, K.C., M.P.Sir Laurence Guillemard, K.C.B., Chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise.Sir Arthur Tedder, Commissioner of the Board of Customs and Excise.Mr. John Pedder, C.B., Home Office.Mr. John Lamb, C.B., Scottish Office.Mr. U. Wolff, Ministry of Munitions.Sir Willicim Plender.Sir George Younger, Bart., M.P.,1Colonel John Gretton, M.P., -n     -    m  jColonel J. Gaskell,  . representing the Brewing Trade.Mr. F. P. Whitbread, JMr. Allan S. Belsher. Chairman of the Licensed Victuallers&apos; Central Protection Society of London.*Major Astor, M.P., attended on behalf of the Prime Minister, and Sir A. Thring, K.C.B., also attended. Mr. R. R. Scott (Admiralty) acted as Secretary to the Committee.2. The Committee was formed at the request of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 77, Minute 5) to enquire into the position created by restrictions on the output of beer already approved, and to report their proposals for the consideration of the War Cabinet. The Cabinet having decided that on the output of beer being restricted restrictions must also be placed on the release of spirits and wines from bond, this matter also fell to be considered by the Committee.3. Numerous commuuications have been received from bodies representing the licensed trade all over the Kingdom, and deputations from many of them have been received by the Committee or by the Home Secretary.4. The question of Ireland was considered separately from that of Great Britain; and the members of the Committee representing the English trade interests did not lake part in the conferences which were held with representatives of the Irish brewing, distilling, and licensed trades.The Committee now beg to report as follows : 5. The Committee are advised that the proposed restriction on brewing could be carried through without legislation by means of an order of the Food Controller to be made under the Defence of the Realm Regulations (Regulation 2 F). The Order would incorporate the provisions of &quot; The Output of Beer (Restriction) Acts, 1916,&quot; with necessary modifications. The datum year for this purpose should be the financial year 1915-1916, and the reduction should be at the rate of 66f per cent, on the output for that year, or 72 per cent, on the output for the year ended the 30th September, 1914.6. The proposed Order will not improbably have the effect of compelling the closing of a number of licensed houses, which will no longer be able to carry on business at a profit.   It appears to the Committee that it would be unfair to inflict upon licensees* Colonel Addison, a director of Arthur Guinness, Son and Co., Limited, originally joined the Committee, but was withdrawn by his Board when they were informed that the question of State Control might come under consideration.[414] , B
who may close their houses- on this ground the penalty of a permanent loss ot the licence; and accordingly that provision should be made that in such a case the licence shall be treated as suspended only and shall, upon proper notices being given on or before the termination of the war, be revived for the then current year and be in the same position as if it had not been suspended. The Committee are advised that it is doubtful whether this provision can be made by Defence of the Realm Regulation, and that it would be better to deal with it by legislation.7. The corresponding restriction on the release of spirits and wines from bond would take the form of a regulation under the Defence of the Realm Acts empowering the Treasury to make orders restricting such release, and containing certain consequential directions. The datum year for this -purpose should be the calendar year 1916. If the reduction is to correspond exactly with the reduction on beer, it should be at the rate of 57 per cent. ; but that percentage would be an awkward one to apply, and the Committee suggest that a reduction of 50 per cent, would be sufficient.8. The question as to the best mode of securing that the reduced output of spirits and wines shall be equitably distributed among the dealers and retailers has given rise to difficulty, and many communications have been received on the subject. The Committee think that the Treasury should be empowered to make rules for the purpose, and that the administration of such rules and the issuing of the necessary clearance permits should be entrusted to a small Committee to be appointed by the Treasury with an ultimate appeal to the Board of Customs and Excise. Arrangements for th purpose tire being made by the Board.9. It is in considering the financial and other results which would follow from these orders, and in endeavouring to make suggestions for preventing the financial loss and confusion which may ensue, that the real difficulty arises. It is obvious that restrictions of this drastic nature must have the following among other consequences : (1.) The beer available will be less than one-third and little more than one-fourth of the amount available before the war ; and, notwithstanding increased dilution and higher prices, the supply will often be less than the demand. Provision will be made for the Army on the lines of the existing Acts, but inequalities in distribution among the civil population may lead to discontent;(2.) The available spirits will be less than one-half of the previous supply, andsimilar difficulties may arise as to this commodity ; (3.) The breweries and retail houses being adapted for the pre-war supply, andtheir expenditure and liabilities having been incurred on that footing, manyof them will experience financial difficulties.   In the case of breweries, themortgagees or debenturediolders may exercise their remedies; and in thecase of licensed houses, insolvency may follow. (4.) When breweries are closed, the plant will rapidly deteriorate and the goodwillmay pass toother firms.    It will be difficult if not impossible to restorethe status quo after the war. (5.) Questions as to limiting the transport of beer and spirits, and economisingman-power, also arise.10. Obviously these difficulties could be met by State Purchase or (to some extent) by State Control, and both these expedients came under consideration. The represen-tatives of the. Wholesale Trade who were consulted were divided on the subject of State Purchase; and&apos; conflicting opinions are also held in the Retail Trade, licensees in Great Britain being opposed to purchase while licensees in Ireland appear to be generally favourable to it. In these circumstances, as State Purchase would require legislation and time presses, an attempt was made to agree upon a modified scheme of State Control.11. As regards Great Britain, proposals were formulated for a modified system of State Control, under which the Trade could have administered their own affairs with the assistance of a Government Liquor Committee. A copy of these proposals will .be found in Schedule (A) hereto. It is understood that these proposals were approved on the 16th March by the Board of the Licensed Victuallers&apos; Central Protection Society of London; but on the same day they were submitted to a meeting of English and Welsh brewers and were rejected by a large majority. Copies of the resolutions adopted at this meeting are annexed in Schedule (B). As effect could not be given to the proposals in Schedule (A) without the general assent of both branches of the Trade, the Committee did not proceed further with them.
12. As regards Ireland, no special proposals were formulated by the Committee; but at a conference held with a deputation representing the brewing and licensed trades in Ireland, the deputation put forward a memorandum, a copy of which is contained in Schedule (C). It will be seen that, while the Irish brewers prefer to be left to make their own arrangements, the licensees in Ireland are willing to consider proposals for State Purchase. In view of the excessive number of licences existing in Ireland (the total being about 17,000), the Committee think that this offer deserves immediate consideration.13. In the circumstances, there being no immediate prospect of a settlement by reneral agreement, it appears to the Committee that the action described in paragraphs 5 to 8 of this Report should forthwith be taken, and that it is for the Government to consider whether any, and, if so, what, further measures should be adopted.   Two courses appear to be open to the Government, namely: (1) To take possession for the period of the war of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor in the same manner as possession has been taken of the railways and coal-mines, paying such compensation as may be determined, and(2) To formulate and submit to Parliament proposals for State Purchase.14. The Committee hesitate to recommend that immediate possession be taken of the Trade.&quot; In the case of the railways and the coal mines, the Government had to deal with a limited number of large corporations or firms, who could be relied upon to carry on the undertakings to the best advantage, and to account to the Government for the profits. But in the case of the licensed houses it would be necessary to take over thousands of small concerns, many of which have with difficulty been controlled by experienced brewery officials. To manage these concerns, to control the employes, to keep a hold over the stock-in-trade and cash receipts, to deal with the many questions of order which must arise, and to deal fairly with the present traders and their families (many of whom depend on their daily trade for a living), would require the services of a big Department with a large and expert staff such as could not be got together at short notice, and would be a transaction likely to result in loss. The power to take possession should not of course be abandoned, but the Committee do not under present circumstances recommend that it be exercised.15. With regard to State Purchase, it is not desirable that an opinion should be expressed by a Committee containing persons interested in the trade, and it seems better that this question should be decided by the Cabinet, and that in order to put an end to the present uncertainty a public announcement of their decision should be made. If the Cabinet decide on purchase the Committee think that, as the circumstances differ in different parts of the United Kingdom, the terms and conditions should be considered by three Committees, one for England and Wales, one for Scotland, and one for Ireland.16. It has been suggested that provision should be made for the temporary suspension of covenants in leases as to the maintenance of licences, and that in order to prevent undue hardship and to facilitate the concentration of businesses the exercise by mortgagees and debenture-holders of their remedies during the period of restriction should be controlled. This might be effected by an extension of the Courts Emergency Powers Acts.17. Questions have also been raised as to a remission of licence duties and com-pensation levy. The Committee hope that this question will be sympathetically considered.18. The Committee are glad to be informed that the brewers are favourably considering proposals for compensating tied tenants whose houses are temporarily closed.The Committee recommend (1.) That action be taken for restricting the output of beer and the release of wines and spirits from bond as described in paragraphs 5 to 8 of this report.(2.) That the War Cabinet do consider the question of State Purchase of&quot; the liquor trade, and make an announcement on the subject.(3.) That in the event of the War Cabinet deciding on purchase, Committees be appointed to consider the terms of purchase, and to report to the Cabinet.GEO. CAVE, Chairman.March 21, 1917.
Proposals made by the Committee and not accepted. 1. Two bodies will be formed:--(a.) A Liquor Committee (or Liquor Commission) to be appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to consist of (say) five or six members with public or official experience.(6.) A Trade Management Committee to be chosen by the trade, and to contain representatives of all the interests affected; the constitution of this Committee to be subject to the approval of the Liquor Committee.2. It will be the duty of the Trade Management. Committee to frame a scheme or schemes for the manufacture, distribution, and sale of the reduced quantity of beer available, with due regard to financial considerations and to the necessity of economising labour and providing for the requirements of the military forces and munition workers, and with the assistance of local sub-committees to give effect to such scheme or schemes.3. The Trade Management Committee will have no compulsory powers, but it will be necessary, in order to deal with dissentient members of the trade, that it should have some compelling force behind it. Accordingly, any scheme framed by the Trade Manage-ment Committee will be submitted for approval to the Liquor Committee, which will be empowered, for the purpose of giving effect to an approved scheme, to direct the closing of breweries and licensed houses and the suspension of licences. The Liquor Committee will also have power to make orders as to such matters as the suspension of the remedies of mortgagees and debenture-holders, the modification of covenants in leases, the transfer of certificates under the legislation relating to the output of beer, the distribution of the available liquor, and the supply of liquor to the army.4. Unless otherwise agreed, the licence of a house closed under a scheme will not be extinguished, but will be suspended by the Liquor Committee and will revive at the end of the war, and be then held on the same conditions as if the house had not been closed.5. The Liquor Committee, before directing the closing of any licensed house or the withdrawal or suspension of a licence, will require to be satisfied that provision has been made by the trade, by compensation, pooling, or otherwise, for the fair treatment of the holder of the licence.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will be asked to consent to a considerable reduction of the licence duties. The question- of the compensation levy must also be considered.7. The Liquor Committee will be located at the Home Office, and the Home Secretary will respond for it in Parliament. The Trade Management Committeewill be an independent body, and will make its own arrangements.8. The relations of the Liquor Committee to the Central Control Board will have to becarefidly considered in consultation with that Board, and some adjustment may be necessary in order to prevent overlapping. In the meantime, the Home Secretary should be substituted in Regulation I of the Defence of the Realm (Liquor Control) Regulations for the Minister of Munitions.Schedule (B).Resolutions adopted at a Meeting of Brewers : March 15, 1917.1. That this meeting of brewers of England and Wales prefers to meet the difficulties of the new restrictions by voluntary arrangement without Government control, but asks for the assistance of the Government in providing for the restoration of the licences of houses which may.be temporarily closed, and immunity from obligations in respect of loans, mortgages, and debenture trusts; covenants in leases as to main-tenance of licence and schedule of prices, &amp;c.Schedule (A).
Also as an. instruction to the Committee to place before Sir George Cave_2. That the brewing trade would not oppose complete State Control of the industry, provided that during the time of control a guaranteed periodical payment was made to those engaged in it. Such payment to be equal to pre-war profit or to the amount as calculated for the pre-war standard of profits for the purpose of excess profits duty, and that any loss or mutilation of assets or goodwill taking place during the control period be fully compensated for in the event of State purchase-upon a basis now to he agreed upon not taking place at the termination of the control period. Dis-possessed licensees, directors, and other persons sufTering loss of position or remuneration, to be adequately compensated.Schedule (C).Memorandum put forward by the Irish Trade Committee.Case for the lletail Licensed Trade of Ireland.Before proceeding with the actual details of our case on behalf of the Irish Licensed Trade in connection with the proposed restrictions for Spirits and Beer, we are directed to ascertain whether the Government are prepared to entertain a scheme of State Purchase of all the Licensed Houses in Ireland with full compensation. If so we are prepared to deal with it.Secondly: Will consideration be given to that section of the trade who will inevitably be forced out of business as the result of those proposals, even assuming that the relief we ask for is granted in its entirety.We have been asked to submit some scheme by which these proposals can be carried out without dealing a death blow to the Licensed Trade of Ireland, and while we feel that the relief wre ask for is not at all adequate to the loss sustained or com-mensurate with the hardship that would be inflicted, we, in the circumstances of the times, confine ourselves to the following respectful demand: 1. Y/e ask relief in rates, rent, licence duty, wages, and other standing charges; equivalent to the amount of restriction imposed, with a minimum of 50L per annum per house.2. We ask that in carrying out the Prime Ministers proposal to estimate the permits for spirits allowed out of bond on the same basis as those for the brewers, the fact should be taken into consideration that in Ireland the clearances from bond do not indicate the actual consumption. Owing to scarcity of capital and difficulties in obtaining it, the Irish retailers were not able to hold their usual stocks of duty-paid spirits, as supplies were curtailed and the price went up considerably. We reckon that there were in each public house 50 gallons less on hand at the end of 1916 than at the end of 1915. The actual consumption must therefore be represented by the clearances from bond with the addition of 50 gallons per house, and this should be taken as the figure on which the reduction corresponding to that of the brewers should be based ; that it be optional with the retailer to take 1915 or 1916. conceding that if total clearances for Ireland for 1915 are greater than those of 1916, the percentage of reduction must be increased proportionally, In estimating the reduction to be made in the allowance of spirits for Ireland it must always be borne in mind that there is a grave risk of the increase of illicit distillation with all its attendant evils.As the spirits required are already manufactured and stored in bond, no question of food supply arises, and as the amount allowed out will in any case be greatly reduced from that of last year, there can be no possibility of consumers being driven from beer to spirits.3. We have a mandate from the entire licensed trade of Ireland, allied interests, and public bodies against any form whatever of State Control.The Case for Brewers, Distillers, and Wholesale Merchants.1. That, except as to restriction in output, all Irish brewers be left free to continue their businesses at-present; . &quot;*
2. That after the war the restrictions on the manufacture of beer and the clearances of wines and spirits be gradually relaxed as follows: One half of the restriction immediately upon the termination of the war, and the remaining half twelve months afterwards.   And all imports of beer, ale porter, wines, and spirits into Ireland be limited in a similar manner.3. That clause 5 of the present Restriction of Output of Beer Act be amended the year being altered to 31st March, 1917, and that the right to obtain a certificate be given only to those who have discharged their just debts to the firm from whom they apply for a certificate, and who can show reasonable cause for requiring the certificate, these questions to be decided by any authority the Government name.4. That any brewer, maltster, distiller, or wholesale house in the wine and spirit trade who can show at the end of the-period of restriction that the average profits during that period were less than the average profits during the period prescribed as the standard in his district for estimating excess profits, be granted relief to the extent the profits are so shown to be less, and that in a case where excess profits have been paid, are now due, or become due, they be left in abeyance until all restrictions are finally removed, and the whole period of restriction be treated as one, and an average arrived at.That in the calculation of profits, allowance be made for the realisation of stocks of spirits (actually representing a depletion of capital), which present conditions render it impossible to replace.5. That all malt made for the manufacture of beer, the property of Irish traders, be retained for Irish purposes, but be pooled so as to secure every Irish brewery having sufficient malt to meet its requirements to the 31st December, 1917, and that the price be based on that ruling in Dublin immediately before the present restrictions were suggested.6. That the Government announce immediately how they mean to deal with unmalted barley owned in Ireland.PRINTED AT THE FOBEIGN OFFICE BT C. B. HABBISON.-22/3/1917.
