REPORT   op   the   PRESIDENT   op   the   board   of   education.lt on Wednesday last I held a Conference with the Director ofRational Service; the Director of Timber Supplies, and the Board of Agriculture at which we discussed the &quot;best means of making use of the older boys in the Secondary Schools for national Service.     It was agreed that this could best be done by an extension of the Summer Holidays.     Steps are being taken to bring the matter to the notice of the School Authorities.2. I have laid before parliament a Minute modifying the Codeof Regulations for public Elementary Schools so as to enable ministers of Religion to act as Assistant Teachers in these Schools.     Th&amp;s new Regulation will, I hope, render it possible to make use of the services of many of those Ministers who have enrolled under the National Service Scheme and will go some way towards meeting the serious shortage of qualified men teachers.3.        Apart from the normal administrative work, the Department has been engaged in the collection and tabulation of statistics with&apos;regard to the salaries of Elementary School Teachers.4.        I have appointed an office Committee to consider the lines on which Nursery- Schools should be organised and to prepare draft Regulations for their conduct.2ord karch, 1917.
