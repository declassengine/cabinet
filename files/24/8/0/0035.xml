STAJIMENT .;TTII REGARD TO THE BLOCKADEIkPEKIAL CONFERENCE 1917.The use or the term &quot;&quot;blockade&quot; in connection withA blockade consists in cutting off all egress from and ingress into a port or a series of ports.     To blockade the German ports would be useless, even if it wore possible.    But it is not possible.    Pour-fifths of the German coast-line is in the Baltic, and of that sea the enemy&apos;s war-ships have command.     -,/e could, therefore, only blockade, in the strict sense, tho German ports on the North oca, and that by itself would be useless, because German commerce would flow freely through the neutral ports, such as Copenhagen and Rotterdam; apart from the bwedish and Norwegian ports, which could be reached across the Baltic.To cut off German commerce, therefore, it has been necessary in the first place to examine all vessels going to and from German ports, or the ports of neutral countries bordering on Germany, including ocandinavia in that description, and in the second place to sift out from the cargoes of such ships all goods having an enemy origin or destination and also all goods belonging to the enemy, whatever their destination might be.     The last class indeed is very small and unimportant from a blockade point of view, because it is easy in modernour operations against enemy commerce is misleadingcommerce
commerce to arrange that the roods whan tlioy sot on the sea shall no longer he&quot; enemy property, hut shall belong to some neutral.     The important thing, therefore, for blockade purposes, is to seize goods having an enemy origin or enemy destination.For this purpose the first and most important thing is to provide by our navy for the arrest of all vessels going to or from the ports in question     For upwards of v-o years this has been done by the incom-parable skill and endurance of our sailors in the horth Sea.   Hundreds of miles of sea have been watched clay and night, in fine weather and in storm, in clear weather and in&apos; fog-, with the result that whatever else may be said about our sea blockade, this part of it has been &apos; undeniably efficient.    The actual method of procedure, the arrest of &quot;the. ships and their examination in the ports into which they are sent, is described fully in the report of Lord Peel&apos;s Committee, which has.been cir-culated to the Imperial ..ar Cabinet.The work of the havy has indeed been arduous, and it has been one of the functions of the Blockade hinistry and its predecessors to lighten that work as much as possible.     This to.some extent has been accomplished by the conclusion of a number of agreements.with the nrin-cipal shipping lines trading to Scandinavia&apos; and Holland, by which, in return for coal facilities and- other ad-vantage s,: they, have undertaken voluntarily to call at a. British
British port for examination,     These agreements cover now almost all tho principal snips in that trade, and though of course they could never have been concluded end could be doubtfully enforced without the existence of our blockade squadrons in the background, thoy have been found, I believe, to be of considerable service in assisting the work of those squadrons.    The net re-suit.is tnnt something less than 1 per cent of the ships sought to be intercepted, in fact elude our belligerent right of visit a/id search.But when the ship has been brought in, our ciffi-culties are by no means at an end.     People sometimes ask impatiently why it is the blockade cannot be left entirely to the navy, like other blockades.    For in-stance, we have a blockade of the byrian coast which is left entirely to the Allied naval authorities.     The matter is simple enough.    -Any ship found going to or from a byrian port is brought in and condemned as a matter of course by the Prize Court.    But in the Northern blockade this is not so.    Before condemnation can be secured of any part of. the cargo in a ship going to or from bcandinavia or Holland, it is necessary to shew that that particular part had actually an enemy origin or destination.    It may be, for instance, consigned to hotterdam, and it is common knowledge that in time of peace a large proportion of the commerce entering hotter-dam went on to Germany.    How is it to be ascertainedwhether
whether any particular parcel of goods is going to Germany &quot;by Rotterdam, or is going to Holland for genuine Dutch consumers ?The general devices which have been employed for distinguishing between neutral and enemy goods are des-cribed in the statement of the measures adopted to in-tercept the seaborne commerce of Germany, circulated in connection with this memorandum.    Broadly speaking, what happens is this:-The manifests of tne goods are telegraphed to a .body called the Contraband Committee, sitting in London, and they examine them, and decide whether there is a prima facie case,: sufficient to&apos;submit to the Prize Court, about any one. of the items.     They are guided in their decision; b&quot;y the character of the consignee, and in some eases of; the consignor&apos;;&quot;by the answer to the enquiry Whether, the-- consignee has given - any guarantee against--re-export of the goods; or whether, the goodsaare&apos; sub-&quot;jeet:,..by, the. law. of the; neutral&apos; country toawhich they are. ageing, to. a prohibition of export; and they are also guided now ver-y largely by the amount of goods of that kind which have.:&quot;already-gone into the neutral: country in question.    This is the principle of. rationing;iNow it is obvious that all thesemenquiries,&apos; though they-might be dealt with by any set of men, have, nothing specially and.directly to do&apos; with naval matters.;:    They haver, however;, a great hearing; on; the; subjects with which
the Foreign Office usually has to do, namely our re-lations to foreign States.    Take, for instance, thequestion of the character of tne consignees.    A systemof commercial intelligence has heen set up called thewar Trade Intelligence Department.     It is the businessof that Department to collect information, not aboutthe ordinary commercial character of the consignees,but about their belligerent character.    Have they hadprevious trade relations with Germany ?     Is there anyevidence that they are still trading with Germany ?Have they given guarantees against re-export in the pastwhich have been broken ?    These and similar questionshave been investigated about a vast number of neutralfirms, and those&apos;who have come badly out of the ordealhave been entered on a Black list, which means that un-der no circumstances can they be allowed to receivefindinggoods.if we can help it.    Immediately, a firm Itself on the Black List appeals to the Government of its country, and that Government instructs its reprosenta-tive here to make representations to the British Government.    At first, before neutrals realised how essential such a list was, they were inclined to resent its existence, and unless we were prepared to sacrifice neutral sympathy, and even neutral friendship, the matter had to be dealt with by such diplomatic methods as we were capable of.    In America, particularly, this question of the Black List has excited violent protests,culminating
culminating in a great agitation against the Statutory Black List, which, as the Imperial ..ar Cabinet knows, consists of a list of firms with whom, under one of the Trading with the Lnemy Acts, it is an offence for a British oubject to deal.    I remember that at the height of the Black List agitation in America, the American Ambassador solemnly assured Lord Grey and me that the irritation caused by it would not only outlast the war, but would take generations to put right.Or take again the question of guarantees.     In some countries, oweden for instance, it is contrary to the law for a firm to give a guarantee to a foreigner about the firm&apos;s trade without the leave of the bwedish Govern-ment.    Every guarantee, therefore, that is given, has to be negotiated by our kinister in Sweden, involving long discussions on the principles of international law with the Swedish Prime Minister, who unfortunately happens to be an international lawyer of a somewhat contentious type.:.  Or take again the question of rationing.    It is al-most impossible to make rationing watertight, unless you c have the ration of each article rationed agreed with some body or Association in a position to speak in the name of all&apos;those, trading in-the article.    Otherwise we are put in this position:- Say that the ration Is 1,000 tons per month.,; -Three or four ships come along with cargoes in the early days of the month which erne put to-   ... &apos;&quot; -. :.  - -       -     . a. the     &apos;
the full 1000 tons, and they are allowed to proceed, nothing bein; known against their consignees.     Let us suppose that, in point of fact, the consignees send that 1000 tons on to Germany.     Then, towards the end of the month another 1000 tons comes, this time for general neutral consumption.     oince it exceeds the ration, it is arrested and put into the irize Court, and when it gets there all that can be proved is an excessive quantity of goods going into the country, and our judges decline to regard that fact, and that fact alone, as sufficient to secure condemnation, especially if the consignees can shew positively that the goods in ques-tion were genuinely intended for neutral consumption. It is quite true that much can be done to enforce a ration even if it Is not agreed, by simply delaying the ships which carry the goods in excess of the ration, because delay is, from a commercial point of view, so serious that shipowners will avoid it if possible.   But the result is not that that system in itself works satisfactorily, but that it causes so much inconvenience and delay to everybody concerned, that generally speakin the neutral traders combine to form an Association who shall be able to distribute among them goods of the character in question.     It then becomes necessary to conclude an agreement with the Association.     In many cases, indeed, the: agreement will cover a very large number of articles, and you get general trading agree-ments such as exist in Switzerland, in Holland, and in
Denmark and such as is now being negotiated for Sweden, bince agreements of this kind touch the whole prosperity of the neutral country, the Governments take a keen interest in them, and they have usually taken a more or less official form, and though they are negotiated with the traders themselves, they involve international dis-cussion.    It seems, therefore, -inevitable that though it is the Admiralty that provides and directs the block-ading squadrons, some other Office, dealing with inter-national relations, which can only be the Foreign Office, must be called in to conduct the negotiations, which are essentially and unavoidably part of the blockade as it exists and must exist.bo far I have been dealing with the interception of goods going over the seas to and from Germany.    But there is another aspect of the blockade which is con-cerned with the export from the bordering neutrals of their home products to Germany.    bweden, for instance, exports wood pulp, which is thought to be particularly suitable as the basis of the German propellant powder, bhe also exports valuable iron ores both to us and Germany, and a certain amount of agricultural produce. Norway exports sulphur and copper in the form of pyrites, nickel and fish..    Denmark and Holland export large quantities of agricultural produce      All these things are of great importance to Germany from a belligerent point of view, and one of the most difficult problems which we have had to face is how to induce these neu-trals to limit or abandon the export of these, things.In
I     IM 11 iwh hit ..157In my judgment it can only be done by agreements with neutral traders or neutral Governments.    In several cases this is obviously so.     The iron ore, the nickel, the copper, the sulphur, and the wood pulp are products of the neutral countries entirely, and no interference with imports into those countries would in itself pre-vent the export of those articles.     This is really true of agricultural produce also.    I know it is said that the cattle and the pigs of Denmark and Holland are fed on imported foodstuffs, and that when fattened by these imports they are sold into Germany.    It is even-picture squely asserted that a pig is nothing else but so much maize on four legs.    As a matter of fact this is not accurate.    A large part of the foodstuffs necessary for the maintenance of the live stock of Denmark and Holland is grown in those countries them-selves, and can be grown whatever blockade action we were to take.    It is further said that these foodstuffs are grown by imported fertilisers.    But I am advised that if you cut off all the fertilisers, the reduction in the growth of foodstuffs, at any rate for a year or so, would only be a small percentage.    To cut off feedir^pstuSfi and fertilisers from Holland and Denmark would by itself, I am convinced, do no more than to deprive us of all share in the agricultural produce of those countries, and to increase the export of meat, and perhaps even of milk and butter to Germany, though .-^^^;b^ butter
would, gradually diminish as the months went on.Instead, therefore, of pure coercion, we have en-deavoured to deal with the situation by means of ne-gotiations and agreement, and on the whole I think that our attempts have been not unsuccessful.     With Sweden, indeed, we have not been able to do much.     -Je have to some extent limited her export of pulp, if the new Swedish agreement goes through.     In Norway we have succeeded in cutting off, at any rate for a time, all exports to home countries of copper and sulphur.    Vie have enormously diminished the erport of fish, Germany now being only able to receive lb% of the whole catch, and not even that unless it can be shewn that it was not caught by the use of British materials.     aith regard to nickel we have been less successful, but even there we have made agreements which considerably diminish the amount of nickel which would otherwise go to our enemies.As to agricultural produce, the case has been much more difficult. &apos;   During the first two years of the war, Holland persisted in exporting the whole or almost the whole of her agricultural produce to Germany, and it was only by threatening her with the loss, not only of food-stuffs and fertilisers, but of various other commodities which she imports, that we were finally and with much difficulty able to induce the Dutch agriculturists, first to form themselves into an Association, and then to agree witn us to let us have a fair proportion ofthe
the&apos; produce.In Denmark, things have never been quite so bad. The Danes have always made some attempt to keep up their old connection with the British consumer, and they have on the whole met us fairly when we have re-presented to them that we are not getting a large enough share.    I do not say that in either country the situation is now satisfactory, butlcfcosay that, taking a broad view of things, we are getting pretty much of our pre-war share of produce of both countries, and though in Holland the Germans are getting more than they should get of the remainder, they are certainly getting much less than they did a few months ago.It must be remembered that in this matter we ne-gotiate under considerable difficulties.    we have no kind of right in international law to stop foodstuffs, and much less fertilisers, even though their use goes to fatten beasts which are afterwards sold to Germany, The result is that if we seize and put into the Prize Court a cargo of maize going to Holland, upon the ground that the pigs which will feed upon it will be sold to Germany, the Prize Court would certainly re-lease the cargo.    And the case of fertilisers is even more difficult.     we should have to say that the nitrate or whatever it was would be put upon the fields, which would grow grass or corn, which would otherwise be used to feed cattle or pigs, which would provide, eitherdirectly,
directly or indirectly by way of milk and butter, food for our enemies.     I am afraid not the most servile judicial tribunal, if one existed in this country, would listen to such a contention for a moment.    we have therefore, in dealing with these cargoes, to proceed rather extra legally, by way of detention and so on, so as to make traffic in such things inconvenient  and ex-pensive .     when that has been carried to a ce.tain point the people engaged in the traffic are ready to enter into some agreement on the subject, but it is plain that if this procedure be indulged in too freely, we might get into further serious international trouble, not only with the neutrals concerned, but with other neutrals like the united otates, who would have a more or less direct interest in our proceedings.If I have succeeded in making myself clear, it will be agreed that the enforcement of the particular kind of blockade- with which I am dealing, closely affects our international relations with neutral countries.    Nor is this a mere matter of theory.    For amny months it was impossible to enforce anything like a strict blockade of goods going through Sweden, because of the very delicate nature of the relations between her and the Allies.    For the first 18 months or1more of the war, it was a matter of grave doubt whether Sweden would not ultimately join Germany.    Her court, her army, her church, her professors, were all strongly pro-German, with the exception of the Crown Prince and Princess anda
a few others; and her army is hy no means despicable. She has 500,000 troops, which her geographical position would have enabled her to use, so we were told, with disastrous results against our Russian Allies.     V/hen-ever we attempted to tighten up the blockade so far as Sweden was concerned, we were certain to receive an agitated message from Petrograd, begging us to be care-fur .    Moreover, the only western communication between Russia and the rest of the world during the winter months, was through Sweden.     Now, that state of affairs has been to some extent modified by the building of a railway to a Northern port, which, owing to the vagaries of the Gulf Stream, remains ice-free throughout the winter.    But that railway has only just been completed, and all last winter and the winter before Russia depended entirely upon transit across Sweden for her foreign commerce.     It was therefore quite possible, and indeed sometimes occurred, that the Swedes should revenge themselves for some interference with their trade by us, by cutting off all trade between Russia and the western worlds except by VTadivostock.,.; Norway, it is true, has not given us the same trouble.    Her people are far mtfrer.friendly to us, and her position is such geographically, that she depends almost entirely upon the sea.    Her greatest industry is her shippingy and-she cannot obtain coal except from thi s- country.&apos; -&apos;   v   .&quot; -i       ...... -&apos; Denmark,
Denmark&apos;, on the other hand, presents difficulties of a different kind.    She is absolutely incapable of defence against Germany, who could overrun the whole of her territory with an insignificant force.    Her army is negligible, and she has practically no fleet.    Nor could we help her, at least we are so advised, either by our Fleet or by our Army.    The result has been that the Danes have perpetually appealed to us not to press them to cut off too much of their trade with Germany, for fear that Germany should make that an excuse for overrunning their country.    It is doubtful whether Germany ever would have done such a thing so long as she got anything substantial from Denmark, since she no doubt looks to Denmark after the war as a rnaga-zine fronhiWhich she may be able to replenish some por-tion, even if it bo a very small portion, of her exist-ing reserves of food.    But if she did overrun: Denmark, she would secure to herself immediately some millions of cattle and pigs, and I am informed that her possession of the extreme North Coast of Jutland would be a serious naval disadvantage to us.Similar considerations apply to Holland, and in-deed we have been told urgently by the military, and less urgently by the naval authorities, that it is extremely undesirable that Holland should enter the war either for us or against us.    For us, because the con-siderable
considerable stores of food and other materials within her borders would fall into the hands of our enemies, without our being able to defend her, and against us, because she would form an additional supply of men, and would place at the disposal of Germany her sea-coast and the port of Rotterdam, which would be of very great value to our enemies.     hven now, Germany is said to be massing troops on the Dutch border, and some military prophets believe that she intends to occupy Holland. Whether that be so or not, there can be no question that Germany could inflict very serious injuries upon Holland by her air-craft, and this is true of the other neutrals more or less., without the slightest difficulty or danger. This unfortunate position of affairs has made -great difficulties with Holland.     She has in a number of small matters given way to Germany, and shewn herself hostile to us by her acts, though it is believed that the great majority of her population are friendly to us.     The latest exhibition of this tendency has been her insis-ten.ce on an armed British vessel leaving her ports until she had removed her armament.Nor have the diplomatic difficulties of the blockade been confined to the border neutrals.     Indeed the great-est of them have been with the united States.     Over and over again we have had to modify, luckily in unessential particulars, our blockade policy to avoid a serious dispute with the American Government, and more than onceit
it has been well within the bounds of possibility that the Americans would insist on the serious weakening of the blockade, if not its total abandonment, in deference to the indignation excited amo:ag them by our interfere ence with their commerce.I might go on to recount the diplomatic difficul-ties with other neutrals, and even with our Allies, but 1 think I have said enough to shew that it would have been quite impossible to carry out the blockade except in close consultation and cooperation with the Foreign Office, and with due regard to the considerations with which the Foreign Office has specially to deal.Nor has this cooperation in my judgment militatedA&apos;-.

A very close watch is kept on all imports from overseas into the border neutrals.    Statistics drawn from the manifestsA&apos; - ..;: .a;p&apos;f&apos;-      yAPP-Ap ; --&apos; aAa^.    pp;;a .

From these returns it is possible to say with some confidence that no goods corning from overseas go in any quantity to Germany.     It is, of course, impossible to be quite certain that snail parcels of such goods are not from time to time smuggled across the border.    But if they are, they must be taken from quantities which would be, in peace time, consumed in the neutral -country itself.    In other words, rationing is now fairly complete, indeed quite complete, in all the more important articles of commerce.    We have besides, means of watching the trade between the border neutrals and Germany, both by our own agents, and in some cases bythe
the published, statistics of the neutral countries.    All the information combines to the effect that the overseas import into Germany have practically ceased.     Vie can similarly say that the German export trade overseas is dead.I am convinced that this result could not have been attained unless we had preserved friendly relations with the neutral countries in question.    Sweden, in particu-lar, for a long time did obstruct, and might have con-tinued to obstruct, our blockade very effectively, and it has been the task of the Foreign Office - a task which I am bold to say has been well performed - to preserve our friendly relations with all these countries, and with the powerful neutral countries elsewhere, such as America and Spain, in spite of an amount of interference with their commerce which must have been in the highest degree galling to many of their citizens; for practi-cally, we have undertaken to limit and control the whole commerce of the world, and to lay down for neutral countries, almost wherever they are situated, the nature and. extent of the. trade in which they are to be allowed to Indulge.kay I venture to add one observation.    Those of us who have been compelled to do so, have been wearied by reading much in.American publications about British navalism as compared with Prussian militarism.    From many&apos;- points of view the comparison is-absurd    : British r... ,. navalism,
navalism. if so it is to be called, is not a national disease of which the symptoms are arrogance and cruelty. But it is not to be wondered at that neutral countries have been frightened by the greatness of British sea power.    It is surely vital for the future history, and perhaps for the future existence of the British Empire, that we should, even in this great war, teach the na-tions of the world that great as our power is, we do not use it in order to trample on the rights of nations smaller and weaker than ourselves.     //hen I read, exhor-tations in the daily press and elsewhere to the British Government to destroy Home industry of this or that neutral nation or even to starve it into submission with the object of putting still greater pressure on our enemies, I cannot help thinking that if our national policy is ever directed by a spirit of that kind, it will not be long before the nations of the world combine against us, as they have in this war combined against Germany.
