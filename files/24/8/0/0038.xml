[This Document is theJProperty of jjisjjri^^[44498]FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMMISSION FOR RELIEF IN BELGIUM.1. THE Commission for Relief in Belgium has, since April 1915, been financed by a subsidy paid to them monthly by the Belgian Government out of the Anglo-French Loan.   Russia bears, nominally, a third share in this loan.2. From April 1915 to October 1916 the subsidy was 1,000,0001 a month. From November 1916, inclusive, it has been increased to 1,500,000Z. a month.*3. At the time when this increase was approved, at the end of October last, the Commission had applied for authority to increase also the programme of imports into the occupied territories owing to increased destitution, and to meet this increase they had asked for an increase of the subsidy up to 2,000,0001. a month. The increase of the programme was approved, but the subsidy was only increased to l,5OO,000L a month. As anticipated by the Commission, the pressure of the Belgian Government has obliged it to carry out the whole of the increased programme, while the subsidy given to it has been at least 500,000Z. too little. The Commission has, in consequence, only been able to continue its work by making heavy drafts on its working capital.4. In view of this situation, the French Government proposed in December that a relief loan should be raised in the United States. This proposal was strongly supported by the Commission, but, for various reasons, the Treasury considered it necessary to delay action until the end of January. The uncertainty of the Commission^ position following the rupture between the United States and Germany then made it necessary to suspend consideration of the scheme.5. The Commission has now supplied figures showing not only that the increase of the subsidy granted at the end of October was at that time insufficient to meet the increased programme of imports, but alsd^that the subsequent rise in prices has made it impossible now to maintain that programme at less than a monthly expenditure of 2,500,000L The Commission has therefore asked for an increase of the subsidy to this figure. The Belgian Government strongly support this request, but from communications which have passed between the Commission and the French Government, it would appear that the latter object to making themselves responsible for a share, in this increase. The French Government are, of course, bearing the whole burden*of the relief in Northern France, for which they give the Commission a subsidy of 36,000,000 fr. a month, and they also doubtless attribute the present financial difficulties to what they regard as our obstruction of the relief loan project. The Treasury agrees in principle to some increase, but considers the increase asked for too large, and suggests an exchange of views with the French Government. The attitude of that Government being as stated above, any such exchange of views would be lengthy and possibly recriminatory. The Commission states that unless an increase of &quot;approximately the amount asked for is granted soon they must cut down their programme. On the - basis of the present subsidy, they estimate the necessary reduction at 40 per cent.6. The Commission has recently proposed that, as a temporary modus vivendi pending a consideration of the increase of the subsidy, His Majesty&apos;s Government should guaiantee a credit in its favour with the Banque beige pour 1&apos;fitranger in London of I,370,000Z.-the sum required to protect its European commitments for March. The Treasury objects to this idea on two grounds: first, because it would involve entering into direct financial relations with the Commission, whereas all previous relations have been conducted through the Belgian Government; and secondly, because this guarantee would cover the expenses of the Commission in respect* The subsidy is really slightly lessjjthan this, half being paid in francs at Paris at the rate of 25 fr. to the LPrinted for the use of the Cabinet.

of imports, not only into (Belgium, but also into Northern France, for which Hi! Majesty&apos;s Government have not yet assumed any liability. Against this, the Commission point out that the Belgian Government subsidy, even on the present basis, would bring them in 1,500,000Z. in March, that therefore nothing beyond the mere guarantee of His Majesty&apos;s Government is required, and that this guarantee is only required to meet the uncertainty felt by contractors at the present moment as to the Commission^ future.7. Any reduction in the Commission^ programme would be disastrous to the moral of the French and Belgian Governments. There is no reason of policy against entering into direct financial relations with the Commission, but rather the contrary. The only financial reason against it is that, whereas at present all grants to the Commission are made out of the joint loan to the Belgian Government, any direct advance made by us do the Commission would be a departure from the principle that the three Allied Governments should jointly bear the burden of all relief expenditure on Belgian account. It is submitted that the question is one of urgency and of high policy, not altogether to be settled by an appeal to such considerations.j8. On rthe other hand, the United ; States should certainly contribute very largely to the work of the Commission ,from henceforward. With ,this object a telegram has been sent to His Maj.esty!s Ambassador at Washington instructing him to point out that the Commission ought to find at least 500,000Z. a month in the &quot;United States.9. It is submitted that we should-(a.) Inform the -Belgian Government at once that they may increase the subsidy to the Relief Commission to the sum of 2,000,000Z. a month if and when needed. We should then inform the French Government of our action and ask them to bear half of this increase. If they refuse, we must make up our mind to bear it ourselves for the present.(b.) Guarantee a credit in the Commission^ favour with the Banque beige pour IStranger of 1;370,000J.R. 0.
