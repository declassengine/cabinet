FORMATION OF SHIPYARD WORKERS BATTALIONS.

(Letter from Mr. G.A. Steel, Admiralty to Sir Maurice Hankey and Memorandum by Director of Shipyard Labour.)20th. March, 1917.

Dear Hankey,

The First Lord is anxious to bring before the War Cabinet as soon as possible the attached memorandum with regard to the formation of Shipyard Workers&apos; Battalions which has been prepared for him by Mr. Lynden Hacassey, the Director of Shipyard Labour.

The scheme suggested meets with the warm approval of the Board of Admiralty and the Shipping Controller is also of opinion that it is a most valuable proposal. The FirstbLord is convinced that is once the principle were approved, very valuable assistance in the shipyards would be obtained from those men; and although we are not yet in a position to say definitely what numbers of skilled and unskilled ship workers are serving in the ranks of the Home Defence Forces,  the Admiralty are nevertheless satisfied from the success of the Transport  Workers&apos; Battalion that the temporary infusion of even a few hundred men would be invaluable in the shipyards.

Sir Norman Hill, who has had considerable experience of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion and who knows the conditions in the shipbuilding yards and engineering shops, has pressed the suggestion very warmly on the First Lord.

Yours sincerely.

(Sd.) G.A. Steel.

MEMORANDUM BY DIRECTOR OF SHIPYARD LABOUR.

1. The strongest possible case exists for the formation of Shipyard Workers&apos; Battalions on the lines of the  Transport Workers&apos; Battalions which are already formed and are working with great success.

2. There is a serious national shortage of labour - skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled, in the Shipyards and Marine Engineering Shops in the country.  At the same time there are very many shipyard workers serving with the colours especially in the Home Army.

3. It is therefore obviously right that all possible Shipyard Workers now in the ? Home Army should be made available for work in the Shipyards.
4.    The War Cabinet on 22nd January,  1917,  decided that the Field-Marshal Commanding Home Sofences should spare soldiers from homa-defence to assist in labour of national importance in case of emergency.5.    The release of individual soldiers who remain based 021 widely scattered battalions is extremely unsatisfactory. There is the unmost delay in obtaining the.men.    They cannot he efficiently organised from the labour point of view.   As a result little or nothing has resulted from the Cabinet&apos;s decision.6.    The Army Council (see letter of 11th January,  1917 - 19) Releases/72l(DoR.l) to the Secretary of the A,dmiralty object to the formation of Shipyard Workers&apos; Battalions,   stating &quot;that it is very undesirable on all grounds to bring a milit-ary organisation into the various dockyards and Shipyards and that they therefore regret they do not see their way to adopting the suggestion.&quot;7.   It is submitted that the Army Council wholly fail to realise the Shipyard position: apart from the national short-age,  the fluctuating nature of Shipyard work,  especially repair work,  leads to sudden and specially acute local short-ages in particular yards, while from the same cause there may be local surpluses of labour.8.   The remedy is two fold; First, Mobility of Labour by arranging for the transfer of men from yards where they are not wanted to yards where they are at the time being re-quired, ^ej3jjjidl\y,. A Reserve of Labour which is maintained as an organised body,  in some convenient and definite centres and capable of sending out quickly to yards in the neighbour-hood men of che class and to the number required.    &quot;IthOut a reserve there can be no mobility even of the civilian labour already in the yards.9.    Steps are being taken by the Shipyard Labour Department to make mobile,   so as thereby to economise,  labour by or-ganising local and inter-district Transfer Schemes.   By this moans it is hoped to improve the position, but it should be recognised that any attempt at making Shipyard labour mobile under present conditions is beset by almost insuperable difficulties .10.    The chief impediments to free mobility are (a) Employers are not prepared to give up men who are temporarily super-fluous,   since they may want again in the very near future and know that if labour snce leaves a district it will be ex-tremely hard to get&apos; back again;  (b) Before men will go to another district they must have their rate -ef Wage guaran-teed and must be paid a subsistence allowance,   ithi3 tends to create dissension among3t the men in the yard to which they are transferred,  and consequently Employers are chary of taking men under such conditions..11.    If there were a mobile force of Shipyard labour under Military control available for work in any shipyard as and when required, we should provide Employers with a reserve of labour which would enable them to release immediately any workers temporarily superfluous as they would be assured cf obtaining fresh labour immediately as necessity arose:-We should get over all difficulties of rates of pay,  etc.We should provide a valuable stimulus to civilian workers (as has been proved by the operation of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions).    Frequently when strikes have occured the soldiers working in the Shops have stood fast at work.
Their presence has a most steadying effect.We should avoid depletion of the Army, as the force would be primarily a Military Unit; capable of mobilisation in case of need within 12 hours.    It is therefore urged that Shipyard   Workers&apos; Battalions should be embo&amp;ied (on the lines cf the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions formed under Army Council Instructions ITo. 493 of 1915,  etc.).12   Mr. Ronald Williams,., the Director of the Labour Transfer and Supply Section of the Shipyard Labour Department and who was largely responsible for the organisation of.. the. Trans-port vPrker3&apos; Battalions has worked out a Scheme for Ship-yard Workers&apos; Battalions to provide that:-(l)   Men with requisite experience at present serving should &apos; be offered the opportunity of voluntarily enlisting in special Shipyard Battalions which would be station-ed in close proximity to the principal Shipyard centres,  i.e., Tyne, Clyde, Mersey,  etc. 2.   These Battalions would supplement and not supplant existing labour supply.    These Battalions would be primarily Military Units.bA   The question as to Whether or not thes is a deficiencj/- of labour in a District would be decided by a District Committee which might be composed of:-One Representative of the Admiralty; One Representative of the War Office; and One Representative of Labour.(4)    In the event of disputes arising with regard to labour conditions (  it is of course illegal for stop-page of work to take place)  the District Committee would decide as to whether a &quot;Deficiency&apos;&apos; of labour had be cur r-ed.&apos;(5) When engaged on their ordinary Military duties men would receive military rates of pay..   Phen work-ing in a Shipyard,  etc.,  they would receive the stand-ard ra.te3 and allowances of the District.Yshen receiving civilian pay a deduction would be made to cover cost of billeting and separation allowance, etc.(6)   The question of including in these Units Army Reserve Munition Y7orkers released from Colours who are at present in Shipyards should be carefully con-sidered.
