E C - RET..T- 293.WAR CABINET.NOTES ON WORK DONE EOR THE MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS IN INDIA AND THE DOMINIONS, AND.EOR INDIA AND THE DOMINIONS BY THE MINISTRY ON MUNITIONS-.The work done &quot;by the Dominions and India falls under two heads ; (l) Help rendered to the Ministry of Munitions in the form cf Labour, Raw Materials, and. munitions manufact--ured on account of the Ministry;  (2) Completed munitions and other supplies issued, with units or handed over at the direction of the War Office.The Ministry of Munitions has full information only as regards the former,  and,  save when specially noted, no-mention is made of the work done under the second head.It will be noted that the case of Canada is somewhat different to that of the other Dominions,  owing to the ex-istence there of an organisation which is in effect a branch of the Ministry cf Munitions.It is also recognised that much work which is of great service cannot readily be accounted for in a statement such as this.   Of this nature are many examples of indirect co-operation with the Home Government for the purpose of re-lieving congestion in foreign markets, and for the purchase of commodities elsewhere than in Eurppean markets when it is to the advantage of the Home Government that European stocks should not be depleted; above all, for speeding-up and organising the supply of raw material with the view of in-creasing the quality and the quantity of .the output.(Intld).    C.A.Ministry of Munitions, 24th March,  1917.AUSTRALIA.Gun Ammunition.   No shells are now being manufactured for this country in Australia, but a certain number were pro-due ed by the Dominion during the course of 1916.On the formation of the Ministry.of Munitions,  the Australian Government enquired as to the manner in which they could best assist in the manufacture of munitions.    In reply they were asked on ^uly 9th,  1915   to undertake the manufac-ture of 18-pounder shell bodies.In November,  19L5, the Commonwealth Government had let contracts for 20,000 18-pounder H.E. for delivery by 31st December, 1915,  and for 190,000 for deliverv bv March 31st, 1916.
Labour.       Recently,  direct negotiations undertaken by the Ministry of Munitions and the Commonwealth of.Australia, have led to a cpnsiderable number of skilled Australian .workriien having been brought over to this country (almost 1,000), and these have been followed by 1,000 carpenters and 1,000 navvies.Work done by the Munitions Ministry for Australia.Australia is supplied with considerable quantities cf silica and magnesite bricks for her steel-works.The estimated delivery of&apos; these shells in Baroh 1916 was 2,000 by the end of that month, and 10/l2,Q00 per month, thereafter.Owing chiefly to the extreme difficulties of inspec-tion, however, and of controlling design,  at such a great distance; in view also of the Ministry&apos;s belief that the available supply of raw material in Australia could best be utilised in other directions than shell manufacture,  thereby enabling manufacturers in thi3 country to concentrate their resources on war material,  it was decided to drop the shell contract with Australia at the earliest possible moment. There were also other minor reasons for this decision,  and the manufacture of shell definitely ceased on dune 30th, 1915, though delivery of the 19,224 shell ready for shipment at that, time was requested.0omple16 Hunitions.   Australia has assisted by providing approximately 100 guns.Steel and Steel Work.   Australia has undertaken to supply 30 miles of rails permonth for France.A good proportion cf the following supplies have also been received from the Broken Hill Proprietory Company: 10,000 tons of shell nose steel, 1,500 tons of shell steel 20,000 tons of rails and fishplates..  Raw Material.   Australia, supplies the Home Country with Zinc (500,000 tons in 1913).   Copper, Lead, Wolfram (1,025 tons in 1916), Molybdenite (115 tons in 19167,&apos; Clycerine (with Hew Zealand, about 400 to 500 tons), Antimony, and Spelter.With regard to the Lead, in 1913 we were independent of outside 3 0urce3 of supply for a trifle under three-quafiters cf the Empire&apos;s total consumption,  and the bulk, cf these three-quarters was produced by Australia.   In Spelter, too the Home production is being accelerated chiefly by the aid of Australian concentrates,  of which thousands of tons per, annum are to be supplied for a number of years.
Complet e Munit ions.   40 guns have &quot;been provided &quot;by South Africa..Raw Mat erials,    South Africa supplies the Home Country with Antimony,  sbestos, Magnesite,. Copper, Chromium (with New Caledonia, South Africa supplies ^0% of the world&apos;s consumption.)Labour..       In the Autumn of 19151 200   skilled workmen were&apos; provided by South Africa for the Home Country,, and Messrs.. Vickers: have also brought  skilled men from. South Africa for their own firm;-   but Lord Buxt on has since stated that no more can be spared.South Africa also provided a coloured labour battalion 1,000 strong for employment upon dock transport work..    They are now working at Havre.Arrangements have been made for 10,000. aboriginal .. natives to serve behind the array in Prance, acid some of these,.&apos; .. under Colonel Pritchard of the South African Native Affairs .

New Zealand supplies the Home Country with Seheelite (in 1916   252 tons), copper., glycerine, (with Australia, about 400 to  00 t ons per annum), petroleum (139,001 imperial gallons in 1915)Labour.       A few men only have been provided t 0 the Home Country for, munit ions work, no more can be spared.India.Gun Ammunit ion.    In June 1915, the Ministry asked the Government of India t0,undertake the manufacture of 13-pounder 18-pounder and 4.5-inch HJ2. shell.     The necessary organisation was created and the output began in January 1916.
Irl April 1916, the Government of India wef4 informed that supplies of 13-pounder, l8-pounder and.4.5-inch H.E* were no longer urgently required, and athoUgh the average weekly deliveries in July 1916 were ;-13-pdr, . .H.E. 6^,3^0 roubds18-pdr.      &quot; .   523,419 rounds4.5-inch   &quot; 225,771 rounds,owing to. the fact that- Indian supplies were at a. disadvantage as the result of transport difficulties&apos;, the Ministry definitely informed/the India Office on July 25th that no further H.E. shell would, he required-In Septemher all stocks of finished H.E. shell were shipped, and.in due course the remainder were finished and shipped also;Ho shells are now being manufactured for this countryin IndiaExplosives.   A contract has been placed with the Indian Government to supply 50 tons of cordite per month.QS*B2l^JLMunitions . -,   Over g^O&apos;guns of various calibre have &quot;been provided by India, exclusive of those sent from India t 0 Mesopot amia.Troops from India brought  $0,000 rifles to Europe in 1914, and an additional 40,000 old pattern rifles were sent home as being beyond the power tf India to repair.     These have, been used for training purposes.Rifle Components.     India has supplied the Home Country with 24,000 rifle components, made at the rifle factory at  Ishapore,Finance Accurate figures are not yet available, hut  985)000 have been paid in the form of advances for manufacture of munitions in India.The Maharajah-of Scindia gave  6,000 towards the welfare of munition workers,The Maharajah of Nepal gave  6,436 for the purchase of machine guns. .Timber and Steel.     In the important matter of timber supply India has undertaken t0 &apos;endeavour to organise her forestry so as to supply not  only her own requirements hut also those of theatres other than France with sawn timber.India provides all the material required for railway work in Mesopotamia, and the hulk of that for the campaign in East Africa.A contract has been placed with the Tata Iron and Steel works for l5:000 tons of rails and fishplates for Mesopotamia and Egypt .Ra\? Mat erial.Maganese Ore. OIndia is the main sourceof supply in this material. About 400,000 tons is imported into&quot; this country per annum of which India supplies 100,000 tons.
Magnesite. The Magnesite Syndicate lg^.s con-tracted to deliver o5,00.0 ions of Magnesite during the first 6 months of 1917, and, if reqxkir e d, an equal cu an-tity in the second 6 months.Cotton raste.. .

.     .   &apos; . 6-A number of requisitions have, however., be eri received by the Ministry from the India Office for ammunition componerits., principally for various types of fuzes and.cart ridges, but  even these, do not give the whole story, as many requisitions for filled components are believed to be made on the   War Office and allocations made from stock.Small Arm- St ores.-     The Ministry has arranged the supply of stores for the Rifle Factory Inspection Department., comprising standard arid inspection gauges and armouro-es tools. The Ishapore Rifle Factory has also been, assist ed in connection with.the machines obtained from Enfield.     Further supplies of guages and armourers&apos; tools and further machines will probably continue, to be shipped throughout the war.Optical Munitions.     Considerable supplies have been sent to India.Trench Warfare Munitions. Considerable supplies have &quot;been sent i o India.Explosives supplied.Picric acid Picric powder Nit rat e of SodaAcetone and glycerine (in exchangefor cordite)g Gunpowder.- Qther Commodit ies.   40,000 silica bricks jber month to the Tata iron and steel works.183 tons of aluminium in 1916.Canada *S.0me idea of the work done for the Munitions Ministry in this Dominion can be gathered from the fact that the Imperial Munitions Board of Canada, which is the. agency in that, country of this Ministry and directly under the control of the British Government, is now administering the largest  single business ever carried on ia the North American continent with the exception of those of the United States Steel Corporation and of the Standard Oil Company.&quot;Before the war no private manufacturer had ever made a shell in Canada,-   Only in the government arsenal at Quebec had a very small quantity of l8-pounder shells been manufactured.-Now, the Board&apos;s Headquarters&apos; staff in Ottawa consists of about &apos;700 men, and it has more than 4,000 other employees stat ioned throughout Canada. --   It employs about  600 different factories-.   . Orders placed with it amount to  136..232,&amp;$6, and the amount of money now being expended under the direct control&apos;of the Board is more than two- and a half times greater than the expenditure of the Dominion Government &quot;of Canada in a normal year.
The energy with which the problem was faced and solved in Canada may be judged from the fact that in the production of 18 pounder and field-howitzer shell, alone, Canada, with a population of barely 8,000,000, is behind the total output of the United kingdom by only 4 or 5 million rounds, 23,000,000 of those shell having been produced there as against 30,000,000 in the United kingdom.

Complete Munitions. Nearly 200 guns of various calibre have been received from Canada.

Railway Material. Upwards of 300 miles of 80-lb. rails (second-hand track) and 2,500 wagons, have been provided by Canada, and the Dominion is also building 40 locomotives.

Barges and tugs. Fifty barges for Mesopotamia, and a number of tugs For cross-channel barge service have been provided by Canada.

Aircraft. The aeroplane and aeroplane-engine industry has been enormously extended during the war, certain orders for aeroplanes, and large orders for aeroplane engines have been placed with the Imperial Munitions Board.

The Imperial Munitions Board have undertaken to supervise for the Royal Flying Corps the construction of 20 aerodromes required for the 20 reserve squadrons now in process of formation, and also to act generally as purchasing and financial agents for the Royal Flying Corps.

Shipbuilding. It is proposed that a large number of steamers should be constructed through the agency of he Imperial Munitions Board for the British Government.

Finance. The total expenditure on munitions manufactured in Canada up to the 17th February was £429,000,000.

Towards this expenditure the following loans have been raised in Canada:-

From the domestic loan during 1916 . $45,000,000 

By Canadian banks April to July, 1916 $100,000,000

By Canadian banks Nov. to Dec. 1916 £50,000,000

£195,000,000

By Canadian banks equal instalments Jan. to Mar., 1917  50,000,000

$240,000,000

T.N.T.

Metals and Raw Materials. Canada supplies the Home Country with steel, aluminium, zinc, copper, load, (vast extension has occurred in the refining industry of these three metals during the war), nickel, forre silicon (the principal source of supply of this material, of the 45 ? grade and upwards, is Canada).

Machinery. A considerable amount of agricultural machinery has been provided by Canada.
