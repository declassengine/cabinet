SECRETG.T. 275 WAR   CABINET-.KEMORAKDUI-i BY THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER ON THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN SHIPBUILDING, SHIP REPAIRING, MARINE ENGINEERING WORKS, AND PORTS.(l)     I deeply regret to raise the subject again but I feel it my duty to beg the War Cabinet to reconsider the decision as--to labour affecting shipping which is recorded in the--Minutes of War Cabinet 103.(2) I understand that the War Cabinet rules that theschedule of occupations and age limits drawn up by the War Office and Minis try of Munitions is to be adopted. This means that the unskilled and sami-skilled workmen -can be taken away from marine engineering shops, which in the schedule are protected only as to specified skilled occupations..(5) What I feel compelled to -contend, for is that theschedule should be altered by omitting the words&quot;including marine engineering&quot; from Section 6, page 5,  and by altering Section 1 to read as follows:--   .SHIPBUILDING   SHIP REPAIRING AND MARINE ENGINEERING.All classes of workmen,  excluding storekeepers; time-&apos; keepers;   weighing machine attendants;,  watchmen; messengers;    stewards and cooks;    attendants and door-keepers;   motor drivers;- men engaged in maintenance of lighting and yard plant, greasers, cleaners,  sweepers; clerks;    pay clerks;    cashiers;    accountants and general clerical staff of men without a definite technical trade.U) Important as shipyard labour is at this time, theprotection of marine engineering is even more important. The 1918 Admiralty programme of warship construction came as a blow-to cur hopes of constructing over 1,000,000 tons&apos; of merchant ships this year. -   The warship obviously makes a larger call upon marine engineering labour than the mer-ohant ship, .and the Admiralty programme,, therefore, by raising the demand for bcilers and machinery, threw a greater proportion of the total call for ship labour upon the marine engineering side.     The marine engineering shcp is thus for us the neck cf the bottle, and if the War Office is allowed to weaken the effectiveness&apos; of the marine engineers the..protection of shipyard, labour becomes, pro tantq, illusory.      I am sorry tc say that,  even as things are, we shall have the greatest difficulty in completing 750,000. to 800,000 tens of merchant    ships this year,    If the marine engineering shops are raided, this estimate will have to be seriously decreased. -l5) The point has been made by the War Office that, apartfr^-m the marine engineering shops which are part of the establishment of shipbuilding firms. a large part of the marine engineering of the&apos;country is done by engineers who have mixed establishments, in which they build all sorts of30f
engines.     I am informed that this does not truly represent the state of the case.     The greater number of our marine engines are constructed by marine engineers who solely do this kind of work, and the naming of exceptional cases only servos to disguise the true character of the general case. For example, here is a list of marine engineers who do an enormous amount of work:-Dunsmuir &amp; Jackson, Glasgow. John G, Kinsaid   Jk Co,., Greene ok Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Greenock David Rowan &amp; Cc., GlasgowNorth Eastern Marine Engineering Go.,,. Wall send &apos;&quot;     .     &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; &quot;       BunderI andRichard bane, West-garth &amp; Co.., Sunder land&apos;.&quot; &quot;        &quot; &quot;      MiddlesbroughElair &amp; Co.,  StOckton-on-Teea. George Clark, Ltd., Gunderland McCall &amp; Pcrleck, Gunderland John Wilkinson &amp;. Sens, Sunderland McKie &amp; Baxter, Glasgow Res3 &amp; Duncan, Glasgow Wallsend Engineering Co., Wallsend Shields Engineering &amp; Dry Docks Co., N. ShieldsIt is as simple to protect the labour in these oases as to protect shipyards, and if it is not so protected then there is no case for protecting shipyards,  or, indeed, for protecting shipping, or agriculture.     I may add that there is a very considerable shortage of labour in our marine engineering shops.,.I regret to say that in the first twenty days of March the ships entering British ports with cargoes have given ug , a new low record of the most menacing character,   Concurrently, the Ministry of Munitions and the War Office, who are res-ponsible for drawing up the schedule referred to, demand that we should carry enormously more munitions and supplies than last year.     We have been compelled to buy ships abroad at -inflated prices to make good a small part of our losses. If we are prevented from building ships, we shall not be able to make the extra less good by further such purchases this year, at any price, for we have apparently creamed the&apos;world&apos;.&quot;a markets for 1917 .I am sorry,  also, to have to refer to Port Labour. In Appendix A. of the report it is proposed to release 7,000 men for military service.     This matter is vital. We want, if possible, to turn round our ships more Quickly than in peace. .   The Board of Trade, without consulting this Ministry, consented to the suggested release, as I understand it, because the submarine campaign has decreased activity   in East Coast ports.     The steps we are taking, however, to call home ships from far waters will increase the activity in ether ports, and if, therefore, there proves to be any labour released on the East, it ought to go, not into the Army, but to the places where it is so badly wanted to assist in our tardy transport operations.Ministry of Shipping. March 24th, 1917.
