CHE T.X WivH CABINET.(?.T. 273.TENURE OP COi^iJIY I)I?,E0g0R.SHIP3 BY MINISTERS OF THE CRQWH Memorandum by Mr. Phi lip    err.This question has been before Parliament on many occasions in the&apos;last  0 years.     The last occasion on which there was a public debate was the 19th.February, 1903, when Hr.Swift MacHeill moved an amendment against the tenure cf company directorships by Ministers of the Crown.     The principle which he maintained was that ministers of the Crown, when they held directorships, could not liberate themselves from the suspicion that arose &quot;from the conflict of the administration of their departments and their interests as company directors.&quot; He compared the position of ministers with   that of Civil Servants who were not allowed to be company directors.Mr.Be.lfour in reply spoke as follows:    &quot;There are only two possible objections that I am able to see to.a Minister holding a directorship;   one, that it is likely to take up too much of the time which ought tc bD devoted to the public service, and the other that the mere fact that he is a director may bring him, in that capacity, into collision with some public interest which he ought.to safeguard, or, being connected with a company, he may, if that company and its directors become involved in difficulties, through those difficulties bring, I will not say discredit, but may embarrass his position in the Government and the position of the Government as a whole.&quot;     He agreed that no men had the right to join the Government unless he was prepared to give all the time which the duties of his office required. Did that-however mean, that a member of the Government was never to transact any kind of business of his own?     Was a man on. taking public office to abandon all his private responsibilities? If not, why distinguish between public and private, business! Might no private businesses take up as much time as work for public companies, and did not private businesses get into, difficulties as often as public companies?     He thought that the sound plan was to leave the matter to the discretion of the individual minister.     This was a commercial country.     vJas no roan in business to take a part in the Government of the country? Ministries came end went.     You could not expect practical men to enter public liffc if it meant severing all connection with their old method of earning their livelihood.     Further, if the principle were adopted, it would have to be extended to all the members of the Rouse of Commons and the House of Lords.     It would certainly have tc be extended to the front opposition bench who were an alternative ministry.     Mr,Balfour admitted, of course, that no minister ought to hold a directorship in the affairs of eny company with which ho might have to deal administratively. He concluded by again re-affirming his opinion that the right course was to leave the matter to the judgment of the individual ffiininter, and that &quot;it is confidence in the honour and discretion oi the public men who are called to office in this country and not in any hard&apos; and fast illogical rule laid down by this House, that tho credit and honour of public life in this country will for all time depend.&quot;The opposite case was urged by Mr Sydney Buxton and Sir William Harcourt.     Mr..Buxton thought there was great objection to Cabinet Ministers1 names appearing in large type. Prospectuses or advertisements.     Such a minister was either giv&amp;ng time to private interests which he had better spend on-&apos; public business, or was a mere guinea pig.     The distinction
fjtweea the public company and the private business was that in the first the Minister was a trustee for shareholders and in the Mecond only for himself.     In the first case his duty as a trustee for tho shareholders might confliect with his duty as trustee for the public.     There was only one sound rule and that &quot;as that directorships should not be held by members of the government at all.&apos;    If Civil Servants had to give their whole -time, so ought Ministers.     They were also public servants and their, emoluments were high.Sir William Earcourt thought that &quot;men who occupy official positions of great responsibility should devote them-eives exclusively to that work and&apos; to no other&quot;.     Was-the. .olding of ministerial office to be held out;as an inducement o investors?    The appearance of ministerial names on a prospectus either meant the diversion of the Ministers&apos; time, tftm.public to private work, or the giving to the company of a 05ns credit through lending it the name of a man who -ill fact gave it no time.     Further there were cases where ompanies with which Ministers had had no more than a formal connection had got into trouble and mhere the Minister had had to esign without being in any way to blame, but with great discredit to public life..On March 6th. 1905, Mr.Swift Mscneill returned to the harge with a question.     Mr,Balfour1s reply was as follows: The only condition   that ought to regulate a Minister of the rown in regard to company directorship is the common-sense one hat no Minister of the Crown ought to hold any office whioh interferes with the proper discharge of his duties as a Minister f the Crown,&quot;Throughout, the Government refused to publish any list f directorships held by Ministers-.     Encruirers were referred to Dooks of commercial reference, or to Somerset House, where the names could be ascertained on payment of a small fee.When Sir Henry Cainjiell-Bannerman came into office, he allowed the principle which appears to have been laid&apos; down by r.Gladstone and which was afterwards adopted by&apos;the Liberal &quot;a4ty, requiring members of his Ministry to resign their - -iiroctorships.&apos;    Sir Henry stated this principle in reply toquestion on the 20 March, 1906 as follows &apos;:&apos; &apos; &quot;3?he condition mich was laid down on the formation of the Government was that U directorships held by Ministers must be resigned except 1 the case&apos;of honorary directorships, directorships in connection ith&apos;philanthropic undertakings, and directorships in private&apos; ompanies.     Every&quot;member of the Government has either complied ith this understanding or is in process of complying with it.&quot;On the 2nd,of April 1906, in reply to&apos;a question from u\2ottomlcy asking upon what principles a mombcr;:of the&apos; Govern-^&apos; ^ent was precluded from being a director of public company, but as allowed to act as        managing partner of a large private usiness, Sir Henry Campb e 11-Banner mail: replied as: follows: &apos;It has been fbund: in practice that.it is inconvenient for members of the Government to-hold directorchips unless in exceptional circumstances, and no&apos; inconvenience has; arisen from meiobers of the Government being also concerned in the management of private hisinesse3 in which they are interested.&quot;On the 26th.March 1912, Mr.Swift Kacneil asked whether the Government would introduce legislation making1 the practice inaugurated by Sir Henry Campbe 11-%^^rman obligatory on future
Governments.     l!r.A3.quith replied: &quot;I think the rule is a good one, but I do riot see; my way to introduce legislation to make it binding Oh future administrations.&quot;March 24th. 1917.(Iritd.)     P.H. .
