(5)Sir H. RewT s 1. Report.(Meat) or 2.3.4.5. 6.7.b .9.(e) . -Royal Society 1. report.(Wheat)4. 5,6.7.&apos;8.910. 11..Suggests appropriate whole of refriger^^ ^ meat now allowed for to the Armydraw upon home stocks.Stocks in cold storage he appropriated for immediate use by Army.     A contrary nreeosal is made later on.-I. A.Desirable to continue centre ct with River Piste Meat Co^ for purchase of 50,000 tons a month.    That means appro::imetely 20,000 tons of fresh meat are required.by the Allies1 Armies a month.Milking herd is being depleted, and if not stopped milk supply will be affected.Killing home stocks will - owing to lack of foodstuffs resulting in cattle not being- . so fat - mean loss of about 160,000 tors of beef.Voluntary rationing a 19)6 decrease in consumption in ports.   A 10% decrease all round would be a safe assumption.Any scheme for purchasing Rome supplies for Army must be carefully arranged so as not to increase prices in local markets0? stop import of 550,000 tons of maize or use same for bread instead of as feeding stuff for cattle.Highly undesirable to ration bread.Poorer classes eat sometimes 10 lbs to 14 lbs per head per week.Cannot afford any other diet. -Maintain bread supply at highest possible point and leave consumption unrestricted.3,000,000 more tons - of wheat now available in Canada.Omit as far as possible obtaining supplies from distant places (Australia etc.).Pay compensation, if necessary, to Australia for breach of contract. Obtain all other cereals from nearest scarce of supply/Draw heavntly on. home meat supplies for Home iirmy &amp; civilians.Bread supply far&apos; more Important than meat.last stage of fattening cattle - 15 lbs of dry food^ 4 lbs of which imported - 1 lb fat.Real danger to decrease meat supply as will cause increased demand for cereal foods.
13,   llutritive value fruit much &quot;below that of wheat prohibit fruit as much aspracticable.14.   Weekly consumption bread before war550;000 quarters a week . * o the 3,000,000 tons in Canada would from that source alone carry us up to end of august.

Estimates varied between ZQfp &amp; 50$ as to the stocks in England as compared with normal supply in March.3.    Ireland about 34,000 tons available of which 30,000 would be requisitioned by Army.4.     Army had also requisitioned 29,000 tons for canteen committee in G.B.5.
