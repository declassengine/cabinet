HMORjmm ON THE ASSISTANCE RENDERED TO AND BY THE DOMINIONS (EXCLUDING C AIT ADA) AND INDIA, SO FAR AS THE MINISTRY&apos; OFMUNITIONS IS CONCERNED.The following notes indicate generally the assistance rendered to and by the Dominions (excluding Canada except in one or two cases) and India in the production of War Material, 30 far as the Ministry of Munitions is concerned.     It is understood that Representatives of the Imperial Munitions Board are dealing separately with Canada,The memorandum deals separately with the various munitions and raw materials.It will be noted that,apart from Canada, the supply of complete munitions from the Dominions is now relatively insig-nificant, and in fact the Ministry, in addition to obtaining supplies of raw materials and rails, and developing new sources ef supply, has recently encouraged the Dominions to utilise their surplus engineering productive capacity in manufacturing essential non-munition materials for their own needs, with a view to relieving this country for munition work.So far as complete munitions are concerned, changes of design, the many processes and components involved, and shipping difficulties all tend to support the desirability of this course, but at the same time render the supply of raw material to this country of increasing importance.It is, however, believed that in the early days of the War the Dominions rendered considerable assistance to the War Office and sent home to England every possible gun and round &quot;af ammunition, even, in the case of India, at the risk of leaving themselves dangerously short.The information at the Ministry&apos;s disposal is of necessity limited where the supply of complete munitions from this country is concerned, and the War Office should have much fuller infor-mation on the subject.In addition to the particular munitions aet out it should be borne in mind that the Ministry has assisted India in particular through the Priority Committee to&apos;obtain delivery of Stores ordered direct by the India Office, and in addition has given advice as to possible sources of supply of stores required from the trade.As regards Metals it is suggested that the mineral resources of the Dominions should be discussed on broad lines, not only as affecting present War Material requirements, but also as to post-war possibilities, with a view to making the Empire as independent as possible of other nations for metals and refrectory materials.
REQUIREMENTS.A supplementx is added containing detailed state-ments of the requisitions received by the Requirement Department of the Ministry of Munitions from India, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Hew Zealand,  since the Autumn of 1915, with notes on the position of supply so far as this is readily ascertainable.     These demands are classified under the principal munitions and materials^ and a summary is attached in the case of the requisitions from the Indian Government showing the number of these received quarterly.     These statements state the position in detail from the point of view of what the Ministry has been asked to supply to India and ,the Dominions in the viray of munitions and materials, rather than what has actually been supplied by this country.     Here again it should be noted that the list does not claim to be comprehensive, particularly as regards complete munitions, to be supplied from stock.xThis supplement has not been reproduced, but is availablefor inspection at any time in Colonel Dally Jcnes&apos; . room, 2\To. 2 Whitehall Gardens.
SHIPPI2\TG   TOMAGE   REQUIRED ,   FOR   MUUITIOKS.The following statements give some idea of the tonnage estimated to &quot;be required to convey the munitions and raw material due in this country during April, May, June, July and August 1917 from Australia, India, South and. East Africa.        A similar statement is attached for Canada.

? I I A I C 1CANADA.The total expenditure on Munitions manufactured in Canada up to 17th February 1917 was $   428,000,000.Towards this expenditure the following loans have been raised in Canada. From the Domestic Loan during 1916 By Canadian Banks April to July 1917 1        &quot; &quot;     2\Tovember &amp; December$ 4 5&apos;, 000,000   100,000,000 $     50,000,000equal inst alment8 January to March 1917    195,000,000r4   50,000,000$   245,000,000INDIA:Accurate figures are not yet available but  985,000 haa been paid in the form of advances for I manufacture of munitions in India.A gift of  6,000 was received from the (Maharajah of Scindis. towards the welfare of Munition workers. .A gift of  6,436 was also received from the Haharajsh. of Nepal for the purchase of machine Guns.iSlZSALAhP.Total payments  47,000AUSTRALIA.A few contracts have been placed with Australian Producers, but we have had no direct monetary dealings with the Commonwealth Government.
GUNSIndia and the Dominions have not hitherto directly assisted the Ministry Bn the supply of Artillery material.An enquiry was addressed to India in October 191??, enquiring as to tho possibility of the manufacture of l8-pdr guns and&apos;Carriages and 4.5&quot; Howitzer and carriages, but it was stated in reply that all that could be spared was offered to the Imperial Government as soon as manufactured, and that it should be borne in mind that India&apos;s own needs were considerable.Tho Ministry has, however, been asked to supply a considerable amount of artillery material,. both raw and finished, to India and the Dominions, in addition to requests made direct to the War Office and dea.lt with by them.   -It is suggested that   many of these items could have been made locally, thus saving a great deal of labour in placing and carrying out small contracts for special parts, when every source of supply in this country, is.taxed.to the utmost, with large orders to meet the requirements of the Armies in the Field.India, and the Dominions can therefore help in relieving such congestion in the manufacturing resources of this country for artillery material by refraining from demanding any items which can in any way bo dispensed with or procured, elsewhere.     Probably, the latter course would lead to quicker supply.
The Ministry of Munitions are not in a position to give complete information as to the assistance rendered to India and the Dominions in the way of G-un Ammunition, as considerable issues have been made from stock direct by the War Office, particularly to India and &quot;D51 Force, E.G., on February 6th the Commander-in-Chief, India asked the War Office for the following ammunition to be sent with all possible despatch:-s.	H .E.1.8-pdr.            80,000  &apos; 4.5&quot; Hr.          15,000 13-pdr.            10,000	20,000 5,ooo 2,000 tA number of requisitions have however been received by the Ministry from the India Office and the High Commissioners for Canada and Australia for ammunition components, principally for various types of fuzes and cartridges, but even these do not give the whole story, as many requisitions for filledcomponents are believed to be made on the War Office and-allocations made from stock.AMMUNITION AND COMPONENTS.
This latter column is being checked as there is reason to believe that it 13 on the low side.As regards the supply of empty Shell and Components received from the Dominions and India,, the following statement shows a comparison of supplies from:-(l)     Canada (2)      Australia (3)     India (4)     U/S.A&apos;,with the estimated total production from the beginning of tho war to the end of 1916 from all sourcesNo shells are now being manufactured for this country in either India or Australia, but the following notes show what has been done in the ;past as regards shell manufacture from these two countries, the latter figures being based on issues of complete rounds overseas plus stocks of empty and filled shell and components respectively at the end of the year.

SHELL   MANUFACTURE.   .INDIAIn June 1915 the Ministry of Munitions requested the Government of India to undertake the manufacture of 13-pdr, 18-pdr a and 4.5&quot; H.E.shell.     The necessary organisation was created and output commenced in January 1916.In April 1915 the Government of India were informed that supplies of lo-pdr, 18-pdr and 4.5&quot; H.E.shell were no longer urgently required from India and were asked whether shell of these natures, already manufactured hut not despatched, could &quot;be used in India.     The Indian Government were also asked whether   &apos;   1 lo-pdr. &amp; 18 pdr. shrapnel could he supplied in lieu of H.E.A reply was received from India in May last stating that Works had sufficient steel on hand to meet requirements for all three classes of II.E. shell for acme   5 months and asked (1) whether manufacture should continue until stocks exhausted and (2) if further supplies of steel&apos;should he arranged for.   . The H.E. shell already manufactured could not he filled in India.   . It was also stated that all 18-pdr and 15-pdr Shrapnel manufactured in India was required for Mesopotamia and Terri-torial Batteries.The position as regards supplies of 13-pdr, 18-pdr .and 4.5&quot; H.E. shell towards the end of July 1916 in this country was as follows:-! i    lature i -	Stock on July 22nd -	Average .weekly delivery in July	Weekly require-mentlo-pdr H.E,	913,000	65,370	14,17018-pdr-E.E.	16,605,000	585,419	280,0004,5&quot; E.E.	r 3,355,000	225,771	215,750i			It will he noticed that there was a 64 weeks&apos; supply of 13-pdr,,59 weeks&apos; supply of 18-pdr and 15 weeks&apos;  supply of 4.5&quot;, whilst in each case the weekly delivery was. well above the requirement.   Further, in the case of the **.5W deliveries were expected to rise to 28**,000 a week in August.    It therefore became necessary, in order to avoid extravagant expenditure, to reduce supplies of all three natures of shell, and as Indian supplies were at a disadvantage owing to transport difficulties, the Ministry definitely informed the India Office on July 25th that further supplies of 13-pdr, 18-pdr and 4.5&quot; shell from India were not required, but that supplies of steel would be of great assistance to this country.In September India was asked to ship all finished shell of these natures on hand, and to complete and ship all partly finished shell.As regards steel, it was... understood that none could be supplied without grave inconvenience.to India.
The requirements for all natures of ammunition were reviewed &quot;by the War Office and Ministry in the autumn of 1916 as a result of the- experience    gained in the Somme Offensive, with the result that the requirements for 18-pdr and 4.5&quot; ammunition were considerably increased,  and an enquiry was made of India as to Whether manufacture of these natures for this country could be resumed;&apos;  if not, what quantities of steel could be supplied.   , India however replied on January 2nd 1917, ,stating that the whole of the H.E.Shell manufacture organisation hal been dispersed and was now employed in other services,  and that considerable delay ..ould occur in re-establish ing output.   Further that their requirements for Shrapnel were in excess of possible production in India: and that the entire maximum output of Steel Works would be taken up for next seven months Kith demands for rails &amp;c., and that rolling of shell steel could not be resumed before the end of that period v/ith-out interference with the supply of these rails.
SHELL MA5UPAGTUHIC.Australia.On the formation of the Ministry of Munitions,  the Australian Government enquired as to the manner in which they could best assist in the manufacture of Munitions, and in reply were asked on July 9th 1915,  to undertake the manufac-ture of 18-pdr. shell bodies.In November 1915 the Comrfionwealth Government had let contracts for. 20,000 18pdr. H.E. for delivery by .31st December 1915.-. and for 190,000 for delivery by March 31st,  an extension of these contracts to June 30th being subsequently granted.The estimated delivery of these shell in March,  1915 -was 2,000 by the end of that month and 10/12,000 per month thereafter.During.the Spring of 1916   the Ministry, however,re-considered the question of shell production in Australia, ansl in view of the following considerations :-(l) Slow progress of orders in Australia.(2) Ample production from home.(In.this connection&quot;it may be mentioned that in July 1916 there was a stock of 18-pdr. H.E. equivalent to 59 weeks requirements).(3) Reduced cost of production in this country.(4) Home manufacturing capacity in excess of supply of raw material.(5) Shortage of shipping.(6) Increasing demand for large shell in a high-er proportion,  and the difficulties attend-ing beginning of heavy shell manufacture-in Australia.the Colonial Office were definitely informed on September 1st 1916 that the Ministry considered that the available supply of raw material in Australia could best be utilised in other directions than shell manufacture,  thereby enabling manufac-turers in this country to concentrate their resources on V/ar material,  and especially by the shipment of steel,  and vould therefore much prefer to drop the shell contract at the earli-est possible moment.It was then underetood that all 18-pdr. contracts terminated and manufacture ceased on June 30,  1916, but that 19,224 shell were ready for shipment.    The Colonial Office were requested to arrange for shipment of these shell and 2,874 have now been delivered.    The majority of these shell have been inspected in this country, and have all been accepted.
ISSTEELThe following notes show what is being done in India and Australia towards supplying this country with Steel.Although it is realised that the home retirements of both countries are considerable,  the Ministry &quot;attach gre-^t importance to the delivery of the contracts already placed -I nd i a,As regards supplies of steel from India,  as indicat-ed in the statement on Shell production no shell steel is bein-i; supplied to this Country at the present time.    A con-tract, however, has been placed with the Tata -rcn and Steel Works for 15,800 tons of rails and fishplates,  to be used in Mesopotamia and Egypt to be delivered at the rate of 3,500 tons per month, first delivery to be made in February 1917, but it is understood that nothing has been rolled yet.The Ministry believe that the Tata, Company could produce a, further 2,000 tons a month of rails or shell steel if further supplies of silica bricks could be obtained. It is difficult,  if not impossible to give the Company all the bricks they -wish without prejudicing supplies to steel-works in this country,, but it has been arranged to supply the firm with about 40,000 silica bricks per month which from home experience should be sufficient to keep up their present output of steel and afford - a -margin for additional furnaces.V T EEL-IAustralia.As regards -supplies of steel from Australia contracts have been entered into with the Broken Hill Proprietory Company for(l) IOjOOO tons of shell nose steel.(2)    1,500 tons of shell steel.(3) 20,000 tons of Rail and. Fishplates.As regards (l) the whole 10,000 tons has now been completed, of which 4,300 tons have been shipped or arranged for.    The balance of 5,700 tons is awaiting shipment and the Linistry are endeavouring to hasten shipment.  (2) The Shell steel is coming forward very slowly.The 3rd. contract for heavy rails etc. for Egypt,&apos; ;     e3opotamia. and Sa.loni.ca is due to be delivered at the rate 4,000 tons per month,  commencing in February,  1917.    It is understood that about 2,000 tons have been rolled, up to the present.
MAFGAHBSB ORE.INDIA.India, is the main source of supply for manganese are tc this country,  of which about 400,000 tons per annum is imported and roughly one half has been exported in the form of ferro manganese to Italy, France, Swedon and America.MAGFE3ITE.A contract has been concluded with the Magnesite Syndicate whereby the latter engage to deliver 25,000 tons of magnesite during the first 6 months of this yeai&amp; and an equal quantity if required in the second 6 months of the year.This will be a/bout five or six times the quantity previously obtained from the magnesite mines of Salem (near Madras) in any one year.    It is not thought that it will be necessary to ask India to assist us beyond thi s.We have shipped, a certain quantity of silica and magnesite bricks for use in the steelworks of Canada, Australia and India.The quantities have not been as large as the Min-istry would have wished,  or as the Dominions and India demanded, but this has been due to the fact that there has been a pronounced shortage of tho.ee supplies for the steelworks in this country during the whole period of the War.FERRO SILICON.The principal supplier of ferro silicon of the 45^ grade and upwards is,America (Canada).   Previously supplies were mostly obtained from Prance - a cer-tain amount still comes from Scandinavia.
A L U M I It I U M.The Ministry has received no assistance from the Dominions or India.     Investigations are however at present &quot;being nude with regard to deposits of Bauxite in British. Guiana, hut it will probably be a considerable time before this can be developed. A small consignment of Bauxite has recently arrived from the Gold Coast where deposits have been found.In 1916 we supplied 185 tons of Aluminium to India and to the Domenions small quantities for machinery in connection with dairies.At a conference held on the l-*th September 1915 the Aluminium position was reviewed and in view of the production of Aluminium by the British and Canadian Companies being insuffi-oieht. to meet our requirements for munition purposes it was considered desirable to investigate at once the possibility of installing plant in India, in order to produce, say 10,000 tons of Aluminium per annum.     The installation of a plant of this character Is not likely to appeal to private enterprise, as the trade in resent years in India has been captured by German and American Companies who dumped their surplus output in Great Britain and the Colonies.     The scheme would involve consider-able expenditure of capital, and it would, no doubt be carried . through only provided the Government were prepared to undertake the finance.ANTIMONY.The present output within the Empire is insufficient to meet requirements on account of the increased demand.     By en-couraging production in Australia and Canada and investigating the possibility of deposits in New Zealand and South Africa, it night be possible for us to be independent of outside sources of supply.ASBESTOS.Apart from Canada, small quantities, averaging about IjSOO tons a year are quarried in South Africa.   Deposits have &amp;lao been found in South Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus and India but the total amount is very small.0 E BO M I U M.The principal source of supply is Rhodesia, which with ^ew Caledonia, supplies about 90% of the world&apos;s consumption. * branch line is now under construction to develop the Chrome aePosits in Baluchistan.METAL   SUPPLIES   WITHIN   BRITISH   DOMINIONS. (EXCEPT    CANADA)
COPPER.It is suggested that South Africa might he asked to send a full Report on the Mines in German South rest Africa and the possibility of generally increasing the output of copper in South Africa.     An arrangement has already been suggested regarding the copper deposits in the Belgian Congo by which the production could be exchanged for^a supply of Australian sine concentrates to send to Belgium.It is considered that the South African authorities might well be informed that it is intended after the war to establish plants in this country capable of smelting and refining large quantities .of raw material, and should be asked to see that no contracts for such material produced within their jurisdiction should be entered into for a longer period than 2 years at the outside and the shorter the period the better..Australia might be fairly asked to send a certain proportio of raw copper to England to be refined, since they have already been given an advantage in their contracts for Spelter and Zinc concentrates which guarantee them a rdniaurc price.The present copper resources of the Empire are equivalent to about 2/ords of the past normal peace consumption of the U.K. and the Colonies.There are deposits of native copper in the Northern portion of the South Island of Hew Zealand.G R A P KITE,The Ceylon Graphite (Plumbago) is a very valuable grade. Ceylon exports only about.1/5th of its output of the United Kingdom. &apos; Its output is probably more than sufficient to render the Empire independent of foreign sources of supply.I R 01: *The pig iron produced in Great Britain from imported source within the Empire has not exceeded an average of 50,000 tons per annum,-.   It is doubtful whether any iron ore deposits within the Empire could be brought to this country in competition with Spanish-and Swedish ore.LEAD.The total -consumption of pig lead under peace conditions within the Empire in 1913 was-312,000 tons and the production 155,700 tons of which 114,000 tons is produced in Australia. The Upper Burma deposits are in all producing about 1,000 tons a month, these, are of great extent and are awaiting the arrival of plant.-   The Bechuanaland Exploration Company in Rhodesia are smelting small quantities, which they hope to.&apos;increase during the year to 40,000 tons.
M AG I E SITE,There are very valuable deposits in India, and there are so deposits in Australia and S.Africa,.but it is doubtful any of these latter, will compete with supplies from Greece on :oount of freight charges.The South African and Commonwealth Governments might be Ked to give particulars of the South African and  Tew South Wales sources.MAITGAIfESEIndia is the principal supplier, the ore being   of very gh grade.   We have been obtaining during the 5&apos; years ending 13 an average of 190,000 tons a year from India, 170,000 tons om Russia, and 54,000 tons from Brazil.     India produces nearly 0*000 tons a year.    Egypt has large deposits of iron and man-nese ore of great future value.Deposits of high grade ores have recently been discovered the Gold Coast in West Africa and are now being worked.MICA.India, which is the chief source of the world&apos;s supply, rnished this country in the year previous to the war with ,500 cwts out of 34,200 Cwts. imported.      The Indian Govern-nt has arranged for the collection in India of all the best ality of mica that can be used for the purpose of manufacturing gnetos.   The Ministry is in continual correspondence with the lia Office on this subject urging that increased suppliesthe best mica be sent forward.There are also considerable deposits of high quality MicaGerman East Africa.I I 0 K E L.So supplies of any Importance are imported, to this country ^om within the Empire outside Canada.PLATINUM.95$ of the r^orld^ supply comes from Russia, very small entities (610 ounces in 1913) were produced in Hew South Wales.QUICK SILVER.The chief source of the world&apos;s supply is Spain with aller quantities from Italy arid U.S.A..      Cinnibar has been found in Queensland, Hew Zealand and itieh Guiana, cut so far these supplies are not of commercial terest
iioTIN. CDIn the year prior to the war, the Worlds production of Tin was 127,000 tons, 65/i of which was obtained from sources within tlm Empire.     The consumption of tin of Empire production in foreign countries was about 66,000 tons per annum out  of a total consumption of those countries of 111.. 00 tons thot is, foreign countries are dependent on the Empire to the extent of nearly 60 per cent of their t ot al requirement s of t in.WOLFRAM AFP MOLYBBSmBf ORES.:The request the Ministry has to make is that the supply of thes-materials should be increased by every means possible, and that the development of new territory should also be encouraged with e view to making us,  if possible independent of any neutral supplies for our requirements of those materials..,As regards what we have already received from British Possessio the following figures arc given;-India (Burma has supplied over 19rb6 3^00 tons WolframStraits            &quot; &quot;  &quot; &quot; &quot; 840     &quot;         &quot;Australia         &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1025     &quot;         &quot;M\tralia        &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 11T    &quot; MolybdeniteMew Zealand     &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2?2     &quot; SchcelitevVith regard to what the Ministry has done to assist the Dominion ans India,  it must be .remembered that the control of Wolfram and Molybdenite had the effect of establishing a steady price and a sure market for these materials (in the case of Wolfram, double the pre-war price)     Although the expense in connection with the production may have increased to a certain degree, tho increase in price un*-doubtedly much mere than covers any such higher cost and the lu output in Burma has increased enormously as the good price has been an incentive for the development of new territory.     - &apos; *-ZIMC    (SPELTER).Tho chief sources of supply of zinc ores in 1913 were:-Unitcd States of America.....&apos;...... 700,000 tons.Silesia............................  27,000      &quot;andAust ralia...........................  00.000     &quot;The American production has increased enormously during the war and is still increasing.The normal consumption of Spelter in Great Britain before the war was a little more than 200;COO tons per annum of which   ,000 tons were produced in Great Britain.     This,  it  is hoped, to increase to as much again.Tho imports during 1913 were.:-Prom Germany......................... 64.000 t ons&quot;   Belgium......................... 53&apos;. 000   &quot;11    Holland......................... 13&apos;, 000    &quot;&quot;   IMS.A. and Prance about...;..... 5,000 tons e&apos;a-A small quantity each from Australia and Canada.   The Home Production of Spelter is being accelerated chiefly by the aid of Australian Concentrates of which about 100,000 tons per annum ere to be supplied for a number of years.
jss     21Taking the spelter consumption of the British Empire under normal conditions at a little over 200,OCrCVtons the output of the sources at present being worked within the Empire is sufficient t supply this consumption.Important deposits of zinc, lend,  copper, and.similar ore, exists in Upper Burma and will become in the future an important supply of zinc.
SMALLA R M S.ASSISTANCE FROM TEE DOMINIONS AMD .IKDIA.The only direct assistance received lias &quot;been in connection with Rifles by the supply of 10,000 Brackets, Swivel Butt   and 23,000 Screw Keeper Striker, from the Rifle Factory at Ishapore.As regards possible assistance to this country in future, the Machine Gun Section is being continually held up for want of machinery and steel, and it is a question whether it would not be possible for the Dominions and India to help in this direction.It may also be possible for India to supply any further surplus Rifle components which might become available for the purposes of the Rifle Component Pool.) ASSISTANCE RENDERED TO THE DOMINIONS AED INDIA.The Ministry has no information as to the number of complete Machine Guns, Rifles and Small Arms ammunition supplied by the War Office to the Dominions    and India, but they have recently been asked to divert 100,000 American Hifles during March and April for shipment from Vancouver for Hong Kong.The Ministry has, however, arranged supply of stores for the Rifle Factory and Inspection Department, India, comprising Standard and Inspection Gauges and Armourers1 Tools. Assistance has also been given to the Rifle Factory, Ishapore, in-connection with the Machines obtained from Enfield.As regards future supplies, there are at present outstanding considerable orders for Gauges and Armourers&apos; *oois, and further. Machines have recently been arranged for.    It is probable that shipments of these stores will continue throughout the War,
No supplies have been received by the Ministry from India or the Dominions for these stores and the raw products required for their manufacture are not largely of Colonial origin, and, when existing,- may be considered as alternative only to home supply.The Ministry on the other hand has received considerable requests from the Dominions and India for the supply of Optical Munitions of various des-eriptions,  as will be seen from the following summary:-

4 iA statement is attached showing approximately the total production of Explosives during the War, showing separately that attained from Canada, the United Kingdom,,Indiaj U.S.A., Norway and Sweden.Explosives.ihe Indian Government have been supplied from time to time with Picric Acid and Picric Powder and Nitrate of Soda.As regards assistance from the Dominions,  a projected con-tract is under consideration for the production of Picric Acid from Gum, and, if this comes into Operation, the gum in question will come from Australia.It should also be pointed out that, in view of the shortage of Sicilian Sulphur, of which large quantities are required in connection with the production of Explosives, the Governments of India ana the Dominions very promptly fell in with the wishes of the Home Government that they should draw their supplies of this ccmmodity from Japan and the United States, in order to leave such restricted quantities as are available for the use of this country.Propellants.Cordite.The Ministry have a contract with the Indian Government for the supply of 50 tons per month of Cordite, and in return release to them Acetone and Glycerine for this manufacture.Glycerine.In addition to the release to India of about 30 tons per month for the manufacture of Explosives and medicinal and other purposes, about 480 tons per month are released to South Africa for Explosives manufacture and small quantities for medicinal purposes.About 1,000 tons of Glycerine per annum are released in this country for the manufacture of Blasting Explosives for export to British Possessions.Glycerine is drawn from Australia and New Zealand at the rate of about 400 to 500 tons per annum.Cotton Waste.In conjunction with the French Government the export of Indian Cotton Waste has been absorbed in the manufacture of Bleached Waste for Guncotton.     Owing to increasing require-ments of Bleached Waste, the demand has now exceeded the supply of Waste and the Ministry are about to purchase in India for 1917 delivery 100,000 bales of raw Cotton and it is probable that the French Government will also make a purchase of Indian Cotton.     If the buyers are unable to obtain this supply at a reasonable figure, it may be necessary for the Ministry to approach the Indian Government on the subject.EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS.
Salt PetrewIt is anticipated that 25.000 tons of Indian Salt-Petre will he used in this country during the year 1917 for Y7ar and Industrial requirements.Gunpowder.Prom time to time allocations of service Gunpowder are made to India and various other colonies.
^ noMECHANICAL TRANSPORTIt Is not considered that there is any way in which India or the Dominions could help us in the matter of Me c hani c al Ir ans port.There is, indeed, ret.son to believe that motor vehicles have been allocated by tho War Office which were r e quire d by the Br i t i sh Army.AERONAUTICAL SUPPLIES.The Ministry has only recently taken over the manufacture of Aircraft.It does not, however, wish to make any special requests to the Dominions regarding supplies of material for Aeronautical purposes, as the total quantities of material for such purposes coming from the Colonies are understood to be comparatively smell.The main item is the supply of Mahogany from Honduras, of which 3,000,000 superficial feet has been arrpaged by the Admiralty to be received during the next three months.     West African Mahogany is used to a small extent and the quantity may be increased in the immediate future.Very little is obtained from India but it is possible Jkr and P.araie-fibre may be obtained from that country if the present arrangements as regards PI a:: prove insufficient.AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The Ministry has no requirements to make in regard to agricultural machinery, on the Dominions, apart from Canada, from whenoe a considerable amount of great importance can be ait1 is being obtained.MACHINE TOOLS.As regards the supply of Machine Tools by this country to India and Dominion? the number of transactions have not been very numerous.     The Ministry have taken the vie-- that cvln-x to the great shortage of Machine Tools in this country it was&quot;preferable to keep them in this country where they could be employed to fuller advantage and at an earlier date.The Ministry also asked the Australian Government towards the end of 1915 to relieve the congestion of Machine ?ool Manufacturers in the United States as far as possible by or*ly purchasing machinery absolutely necessary for Munition v;ork.

Again, many Corpanies were prevented from increasing their output  owing to Capital restrictions brought about by the war. .These conditions obtained throughout 1916 and are seriously handicapping the production of British Petroleum in favout of the American product.Through the efforts made by one Company in Egypt the production of crude petroleum in that Country for the first ten months of 19l6 was 11-jr million gallons, and there is another Company holding rights on the same Anticline that, wing 10 Capital restrictions, has so far been unable to produce a gallon.Many Companies operating in or having rights in Trinidad are handicapped in exactly the same way and it is safe to -say that Trinidad could produce,  if aided by the Government, some 250-&apos; million gallons of crude &quot;-;r annum.
SIIn spite of all difficulties, Trinidad exported in 1916 34-1 million gallons against 14 million gallons in 191p, &quot;but  it  is to be feared that a large part of this, instead of being shipped to Great    Britain was taken by the United States..      It is reported that. in. 1915&quot; America took nearly 12 million gallons of crude oil from Trinidad.Shipping difficulties no doubt prevent any development of further supplies into this country from the resources of Dominions at the present time, but the question appears to be one calling for consideration as an aftdr the war proposition.
LABOU R.The Attached copies of letters to the War Office from the Ministries of Munitions and Labour show what assistance has been rendered by the Dominions in the way of Labour.
ensH.W.    172932. COPY.MINISTRY op MUNITIONS OF waj 6.  Whitehall Gardens.23id February;  1917.Sir,I am   directed by the Minister of Munitions to refer to the Army Council&quot;s letter of February 15th,  dealing with, the assistance rendered to the Ministry in the form cf labour supply by the Dominions,  and to state that the Minister understands that a detailed memorandum setting out the var-ious sources from which labour has been introduced into this country for munitions work has been forwarded to the Army Council from the Employment Department cf the Ministry of Labour.I am to inform you that since the formation of the Ministry of Munitions the introduction of labour from the Dominions has been left in the hands of the Employment Department.   Recently, however,  direct negotiations have been undertaken by the Ministry of Munitions and the Commonwealth Government of Australia,  as a result of which a consider-able number of skilled Australian workmen have already been brought over to this country.The Minister is not able to state what the number of such men will ultimately be.    It has been indicated to the representative of the Commonwealth Government that there is practically no limit to the demands for skilled labour in this country,  and that the Ministry of Munitions con easily absorb all the men whom the Commonwealth Government can send. It is anticipated that in a short time the number of such men will reach at least 1,000.Owing to the increasing demands made upon the man-power of the country for service in the Army and in labour battalions at the front,  the shortage of unskilled labour and of construction cf labour of various types is being great-ly aggravated; navvies,  carpenters, bricklayers are urgent-ly needed,  and the Ministry recently approached the Cormron-wc-alth Government with a view to getting assistance to meet the demands of those types of labour.    The Ministry is happy to report that the Commonwealth Government have returned&apos;a most sympathetic answer to his request,  and have undertaken to enrol and send to England 1,000 navvies and 1,000 cerpent-ers.   Here again there seems to be practically no limit to the number of men who can be absorbed,  and any--similar assistance from the other Dominions would be Lost welcome.The Minister desires me to point out to the Army Coun-cil that certain inevitable difficulties exist in bringing workmen from the Dominions into this country.    In very many cases it will be found that the wages paid in the Dominions exceed the wages paid for the same type of work in this country.    It is obviously impossible to.place colonial workr men on the same jobs as English workmen and pay them at rates exceeding those paid to the Englishman-    This difficulty has been placed before the representative of the Commonwealth Government, with the result that in this particular case the difficulty has been surmounted.    The men selected by the Commonwealth Government sign a form of enrolment placingtheir

Ministry of LabourLcndon,  S.W.19th February.   1917,Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Labour to tefer to your letter Ho. 121/8979/(A.2.) with reference to assistance rendered by the Dominions in connection with the War.In reply I am to enclose a memorandum as to the Labour supplies obtained from and in co-operation with tho Dcmin-ions and to state that the Minister would regard it as ex-tremely helpful if the present arrangement v/herehy skilled engineers are being supplied from Australia could be contin-ued and extendedcThe Minister is not in a position to know whether it would be practicable for the other Dominions to afford assistance additional to that which they have already given in this direction,  but if this were possible it would be.of very great assistance at the present juncture.I am, etc., (SGD)  C.F.R.THE SECRETARY;WAR OFFICE:.their services directly at the disposal of the representa-tive of the Commonwealth Government in London.    This repre-sentative is in close touch with the Labour Supply Depart-ment and arranges the allocation of the men through the Employment Exchanges in accordance with the priority require-ments of the Ministry of munitions.   The men in all easels receive the local rates of wages for the work on which they are placed; the Commonwealth Government pays a generous subsistence allowance to the dependents of the men who are left behind them in Australia; and finally in order to make up the deficiency in earnings, where the English rates are distenctly lower than the colonial rates,  the Australian Commonwealth compensates the men by the increased subsistence allowance or a special grant in the case of men who have no dependents.   These payments are made in Australia and con-sequently are not paid to the men while they are at work in this country.I am further to say that the Ministry have had under consideration the possibility of drawing upon the resources of coloured labour available in Egypt.  India and South Africa. The question of employbn^ strong labour from South Africa was submitted on one occ&amp;ssion to the Building Trades Feder-ation,   and met with a. very hostile reception.    In view of the certainty of labour trouble en an extensive scale the Minis-ter has had to abandon for the moment the idea of introduc-ing coloured labour into this country; but he desires me to point out that the utilisation of coloured labour on an es-tended scale in France would greatly relieve the labour pos-ition in this country by limiting the demand which the Army are making for men to work in labour battalions at the Front.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,( SGD.) 3TEPHEM0E KMT .
1. Canada..&quot;(a) In the early part of 1915 Mr, Windham and Mr, Barnes M.P.,  proceeded to Canada on behalf of the Board cf Trade, as a British Mission to enquire into the supply cf aima-ment labour in Canada,  and as a result cf their endeavours ever   1,700 skilled men were brought to this country, with the assistance and co-operation of the Dominion Authorities(b)    Prior to this Official Mission the Amalgamated Society of Engineers had independently arranged for a large number of skilled men to be-brought to this country.(o)    Since the mission Messrs. Vickers. Messrs. Beardmore and Messrs. Cammell Laird have also brought skilled men ever for munitions manufacture.2 - S&apos;Uth Africa ula)    In the autumn of 1915 the Employment Department, through the Agency of the Transvail Chamber of Mines, arranged for the introduction of over 200 skilled workmen from South Africa.   Lord Buxton has since stated -chat no more men can be speared.(b)   Messrs. Vickers have also brought skilled man fpcm South Africa for their cwn firm.3. Australia.&quot;Ta&quot;)   Early in 1916 negotiations were entered into with the Australian Government.    It was eventually decided;  as Messrs. Vickers had a complete organisation for the Ses-patch of munitions -workers from Australia to this country, that they should be left to themselves in the matter. Messrs. Vickers have brought over between 500 and    1000 men,  about 400 of whom have entered into contract with this Department to remain for the duration of the war.(b) At the same time, Mr. Hill,  the Secretary of the Boilermaker1s Society offered to bring over a number of skilled men.   After prolonged negotiations this matter fell through for the reason stated under (e).(c) In the Autumn of 1916 the Australian Commonwealth Government decided to send a number of munition workers here to obtain esperience in the English Arsenals priorto taking position in the Government Arsenal in Australia. These were under the direction of Major Barraclough and numbers are still coming over,  the present arrangements working very satisfactorily.   We have heard from Mr. Hill of the Boilermaker5s Society and Messrs. Vickers&apos; Labour Department that this recruiting by the Australian Govern-ment,   owing to the favourable terms offered, has done away with the possibility of men being brought over u .der other conditions iBut it is very desirable that the present arran-re-ment should be encouraged and extended.lLeJL   o a 1 and LMessrs * Vickers1  organisation has brought a few men from this Dominion.

II.- COLOURED LABOUR *In the month cf August, 1916, a coloured labour battalion of 1,000 men was brought over from South Africa for employment upon dock transport work in Prance.They were conveyed direct to Havre where it is under-atood that they are still employed.Arrangements were also included with the South African Government for the introduction of about 10,000 aboriginal natives for service behind the Army in Prance.. Some of them are already there under Colonel Pritchard of the South African Native Affairs Department.It was suggested last year that Maltese should be brought here for labouring work, but it was eventually decided that more satisfactory results would be obtained by sending parties of these labourers to Saloniea where, we learn from the Colonial Office,  they have been doing good work.A few men have come over from Jamaica, British Guiana, Malta, etc. and are employed by Messrs. Vickers.   They have entered into contracts with the Employment Department to remain for the duration   of the war, and we are paying their dependents a separation allowance.India.negotiations to obtain munition workers from India had not proceeded very far before it was found that such importation was impracticable.

The penditure for munitions during the same quarter in this country iounted to about  56,000,000.   munitions expenditure in Canada, .erefore, with less than one-sixth the population of this country : nearly one-third as great as the corresponding expenditure here. It may be Interesting to give a very short account of the growth of is sreat organization.    Before the War, no private manufacturer had ?er made a shell in Canada.    Only in the Government Arsenal at Quebec na very small quantity of 13 par shells been manufactured.    IS :;:tcmb r 1914 General Sir Sam Hughes, the Minister of Militia, irsuaded the Bar Office to give him a contract for 200,000 empty J pounder shells.    In-order to deal with this work, General Hughes )rK3d a body known as the Shell Committee, consisting partly oil mufacturers and partly of members of the Militia Council.   During is succeeding months the orders given in Canada grew rapidly in mint until by the Autumn of 1915 they amounted to something like 250,000,000 ( 51,369,363).By the summer, however, the Ministry of Munitions had become nbtful whether, although a very areat deal of good work had been )ae, the organization of the Shell Committee was sufficiently strong i Carry on its rapidly increasing work, and in July Mr. D. A. Thomas low Lord Ehondda) was sent out to Canada to ascertain the position of lairs and to make any necessary reforms.   Mr. ThonasahormEd e opinion that the Shell Committee was not capable of effectively ministering the very large work it had undertaken but the obstacles ithe way of reform were considerable and when he left towards the end October 1915 no re-constitut-ion of the Committee had taken place, -h Hichens and I took over the work of Ivir. D.A. Thomas and by the inning of December 1915 arrangements had been completed for the SMnation of the entire Shell Committee and for its replacement by Doay Snown as the Imperial Munitions Board, composed of some of the lest haainess men whom, it was possible to find in Canada.   The Shell si--tee had looked to the Minister of Militia and therefore to the nsc-ian Government for its authority, but the Canadian Government ^selves suggested that the Imperial munitions Board should be ;6ctly under the authority, not of the Canadian, but cf the British &apos;&amp;mmient.    The Board was accordingly appointed by Mr. Lloyd George -is an agency of the Ministry of Munitions, directly responsiblefth- All dollars have, in this memorandum, been sonverted into :rliug at the par of exchange viz:- $4.86-8/3).
Mr, J.?/. Fiavelle, the Cliairman of the Board, and Mr.C.B. Gordon, deputy Chairman, are the guiding spirits of the organisation. When they took office they were faced with a task of extreme difficulty..The Shell Committee were employing a very large number of firms throughout Canada, and&quot;in many cases prices were too high. The Board grappled with these difficulties with energy.&apos; They arranged in a few weeks to cut down prices already given by about $4,000,000 ( 321,917) and they reduced the prices for new contracts. They organised on a much larger scale the whole staff,&apos;as will he seen from the fact that in a year the Head Office staff has grown from 50 to 600 or 700.The character of, the work done by the Board is different from that Cone by Messrs J.P.  Morgan   Co.  in America.      Messrs J.F. Morgan &amp; Co. ;.sve. placed orders for complete shells with a small number of large firms.   On the other hand, the Imperial Munitions Board practically carries out In Canada the same functions as the Ministry of Munitions here,    The manufacture of each component part is placed with different firms and It id the business of the Board to see that all nianufacturers are supplied with the raw materials or component parts they need.    The v&apos;ork of the Board may be exemplified by the following extract from a speech recently made by Mr. Flavclle, the Chairman of the Board, in Canada.   Mr. Flavelle said;- &quot;You may be interested In learning of the rMnner in which thip great business is carried on.   Unlike the United Mates, where the large corporations who are given orders for- munitions undertake to furnish a complete article, whether it is a complete empty shell or a complete finished shell, with or without fuse, we In this country place orders with small establishments in every province in the Mniiiiion with the exception of yours, Sir Louis (Sir Louis Levies) where the people are engaged practically exclusively to agricultural pursuits. lie crossed the Channel into Newfoundland and we have almost 4,500   milesfrom the firstfactoryin the East to the last factory on theacificCoast.   We have six hundred odd establishments working for us.   We have between 200 and 250 for which we are directly responsible to supply with rarr product, and these factories, as far apart as 4000 miles, separated by all the physical conditions incident to the weather In this country, ars absolutely dependent upon the good sence, the judgment and the capacity of this Board to supply them with the raw product which will keep them gomng day by day.    he purchase steel and ship it 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 miles to have Itjforged.   We ship it from the forging plants back a-ain five or six hundred miles cr forward two thousand miles to Eachining plants.    We purchase the other component parts of the shells from manufacturers as far South as Florida and as far East as the United Mates or Canada carries you.   We gather these parts and send them to remote points, and every manufacturer from ocean to ocean manufacturing snd assembling shells is dependent upon what we may accomplish in Qslivering these forglngs and components that they may keep up sustained deliveries of finished shells.   -We are in the peculiar position of ceinj cier obligation to deliver these pr o du c t sine c e s sary for War, and which e have undertaken to deliver at a stated time, and yet we have olutely no authority over any one of the plants wherein the work is r;g done, with the exception of the fuse plant which my friend Gordon -o efficiently organised in Montreal.   Failure on the part of the railway o move the components, failure on the part of the steel plants to reduce the product, failure in any one of the various plants to produce no materials required for shipment to the remote point means disappoini-2nt, means delay, means sometimes at the Head Office seven or eight Glared telegrams, many of them so hot that you would think they would &apos;&apos;^&quot;a tho wire while in transit.    The Board have considered they were f us tees for the Imperial Authorities.    Hence in carrying on this dus-wMvAj-.adopted the simple principle in awarding contracts that no patronage 0 favours, no consideration of personal or family, or social, or party.&apos; . church interests would govern.    (Applause)   After the struggle of the -rst few weeks the men who sought contracts and the men who sought that hy should have them came to realise that there was no favour in Election with the work and administration of the Board.    There was enersi.1 acceptance of the. situation and we have. Lad the satisfaction ofTP &quot;i
so     129carrying on our w*rk in accordance with the above principle.-&apos;II. Orders placed in Canada.(1) Shells, Puzes, Explosives, Propellants etc.The amount of the orders placed in Canada for gun ammuni-tion as compared with those placed in the United States is given in the attached Appendix &quot;A&quot;.     In Appendix &quot;B&quot; is given the estimated weekly output for the next few months of various classes of shells in Canada as compared with that in this country and the United States, from which the importance of the Canadian output may be seen.     This Appendix also gives an estimate of the Canadian output of propellants and explosives.      It may be mentioned that certain changes in the programme may perhaps be made, reducing to some extent the larger sizes required from Canada.     But no account of this change has been taken in the figures given which are intended to show the Canadian capacity at this moment.(2) Hai1way Materia1.In December an urgent request was sent to the Board to ascertain whether any rails were available in Canada, as they were badly needed for Prance.     The Board at once took the matter up with the Canadian Government, and the latter generously under-took to tear up a large mileage of 80 lb. rails from existing tracks, possibly up to 1,000 miles and thoug2it they could provide a large amount of light rails.     This very generous offer was accepted to the extent of taking 300 miles of 80 lb, complete. The3e are now bein&amp;- torn up and shipped to Prance.The Imperial Munitions Board offered also to arrange for locomotives and a large number of railway wagons to be built in Canada.     The Ministry gave orders for locomotives but did not give orders for wagons.      Some Canadian car builder3 are building for Prance and Russia but others are idle.(3) Aircraft and Reserye^Squadrons.In April 1916 the policy of developing the manufacture of areoplane3 and aeroplane engines in Canada and the establishment of a Plying School were urged on the Admiralty and War Office Authorities in charge of the   Air Services.      It was pointed ouo that millions of dollars worth of British orders had been placed in the United States, the large profits from which had gone to build up the aircraft industry in that country instead of Canada, a policy which had both political and strategical disadvantages.This matter was also brought before the Air Board immediate * ly after its creation.     Negotiations in regard to it continued for many months but it was found difficult to get all the various authorities into line until December when certain orders for aero planes were placed in Canada.      Shortly afterwards it was decided to carry out a large scheme for establishing 20 Reserve Squadrons in Canada.      It ha3 also now been decided to order a considerable number of aeroplane engines there also.     If this policy had been decided on nine months ago, matters would have been much further advanced.The Imperial Munitions Board have undertaken to supervise for the Royal Plying Corps the construction of the 20 aerodromes required and also to act generally as purchasing and financial agents for the Royal Plying Corps.
J.(4) Shipbuilding.In December last the Admiralty asked the Imperial Munitions Board to advise as to the construction of certain colliers and merchant ships in Canada.      The Board submitted by cable a comprehensive report on the Canadian shipbuilding resources.     No very definite steps have been taken since, except that the Admiralty have arranged with the Canadian Government for the construction of trawlers and drifters in Canada for the purpose of submarine protection.The question of mercantile shipbuilding in Canada for account of the British Government has now been discussed with the Shipping Control Committee,     It has been agreed that, as the 3teamers proposed to be constructed are to be the property cf and to be paid for by the British Government, the Imperial Munitions Board is the proper agency to employ in Canada.      The representative of the Shipping Control Committee in North America, is in touch with the Board on the matter.
41       13III.   Advantages of order ins iu Canada instead of IT. 5-1*.The possibilities for the maniifacture of monitions of all MindS in Canada wore not at all realised at the commencement of the &quot;Tar, cither in this country or in&quot;Canada itself.   If the course of tho V/ar could have been foroGOun, a great many orders Involving many billions sterling, which have been placed in the United States, could have boon placed, in Canada&apos;Instead.   It would have been of advantage to tho whole Umpire if, instead of pouring money Int6 tho United States to develop there tho iron and steel industry, tho aeroplane engine industry, the rifle making industry, and so on, wo had placed tho orders in Canada or indueod the American manufacturers - as would have been cuite easy&quot;- to set up their industries on tho Canadian side of the border.   As it is, it has only boon by degrees that the Canadian resources have boon very largely drawn upon.     first of all, 13-pdr. shell wore placed there; then 4.5&quot; shell; then the manufacture of propollants and explosives; there was coraacncocl later tho manufacture * of fuses; then the manufacture of the larger sizes of shell, 6t;, 8&quot; and 9.2&quot;; lastly, the manufaetxire of aeroplanes and aeroplane engines. It was thought by the Canadians themselves at first that the manu-facture of fuses in Canada would&quot;be impossible and large orders were placed in the United States.   Ultimately, the wiser policy of developing tho fuze manufacture in Canada was instituted with complete success by the Imperial Munitions Board through the means of a National factory.   Large national factories have also recently been created for tho purpose of producing nitrocellulose and cordite. In addition, tho industries of refining zinc, copper and lead have all been largely developed In Canada during the Bar.She Imperial Munitions Beard have always advocated the view that it was very much in the interests of the British and all the Allied Governments that the manufacture of shells and components should, as far as possible, be carried out in Canada, in preference to the United States.   Experience has shown that when the manufacture&apos; of a particular class of shell ishfIrmly established in Canada, prices have been as low, of lower, than&quot;those in the United States, a fact which is partly due, at any rate, to tho millihgness of Canadian manufacturers to name a lower rate of profit.   Apart, however, from the ruestion of price, there have been two other arguments for this opinion.&apos; Tho first lo the evident advantage&apos; of becoming solf-supporting.   If for financial or other reasons, the further export of munitions from neutral countries was suddenly cut off, there would be an interval of many months before the gap could ho filled by starting fresh factories in Allied territory.   On the other hand, if an output sufficient to the requirements of the Allied. Armies wero once * established in Allied territory, it could not he suddenly cut off..The second reason is oven more important.   All munitions pur-chased in the United Statos have to Be paid for in sold or in the proceeds of ,jnorican securities.   Tho amount of tins at tho Allies1&quot;disposal is limited, and has boon heavily drawn upon already,   hhon it is exhausted, purchases from tho United States may be very difficult since America may not lend money on tho sole credit of the allied Governments; except to a limited amount. But certain raw materials must he got from the United States in order to continue munitions nrnuvfacture at home.   If the Bar is protracted, it is therefore essential to husband our limited moans Q  payment so as to continue to buy from the United States the raw material necessary without which we cannot make munitions at all. Every dollar spent in the United States for shells is a deduction from what may be called the purchasing fluid available-x&amp;d the purchase of raw material throughout the period of the Mar.
On the other hand, owinm to advances made &quot;by the CanadianGovernment and the Canadian Banks, more than 50$ of the munitions sirroliec from Canada up to the present have been supplied on credit which will bo extended at any rate till the end of the uhr, But gton tho geld (or its equivalent) which has boon paid for the balance is not a drain on the financial resources&quot;of the allies in the sane way as a payment&quot;to the United Btates.    Tho money goes from Great Britain to Canada, but it passes from one part of Allied territory to the other and is still available for the purposes of the Par since the total resources of Canada just as&quot;much as those of Groat Britain can bo drawn on in tho last resort..   If the money goes to the United Btato3, it passes out of Allied territory altogether and can no longer bo drawn back In the shape of Tvar taxes or Par loans.    It is in fact a final loss to the Allied &quot;purchasing ftuid;1 - a deduction from the limited amount of capital which they have available for necessary prrrchascs from neutrals. In the other caso it is merely transferred from one Ally to the other, and tho total financial resources of the Allies are only diminished by tho amount paid for raw materials which have to be imported from neutral countries wherever the shells are made. This is only a small part of the total cost of the shells.The same argument applies with even greater force to tho purchase of raw materials so far as thoy can be obtained from Canada, or indeed in.tho Allied territory, as an alternative to obtaining them from tho United States or&quot;other noutral countries.     If the war is to continue long, it is of first importance to tho -Allies to devalop within their own territoipy as far as&quot;possible tho supply of raw-materials needed for munitions&quot;*     Thoy must purchase a considerable amoiv t of these from neutrals in any case; but that is all tho stronger reason for not purchasing anything, that can. possibly bo produced by themselves.   This is the only means of spreading out over the period of a long war the limited capital which is available to pay for necessary purchases from neutrals,IV.   Phat Canada can bo ashed to do.The Ministry of Luuiitions have for some time placed through tho Board      Canada all the orders thoy can in preference to the United states and it is probable that speaking broadly Canada1s resources arc now pretty fully utilised.   Bhilo the limits Of her. productive capacity have no doubt not been reached, tho markets for labour and materials are becoming difficult.   - Some of the enterprises now undertaken such as the now nitrocellulose and cordite factories which are now going up and the building of aeroplano endlnos are very late In tho aay, but thoy have now been started.It is probable that much advantage would have resulted from rile development on as large a scale as possible, earlier,, of the shipbuilding resources.of Canada.   This&apos;cuestion had not ^een tackled at all until just recently but the Bhipjiiig Minister has now taken tho matter in hand.Tho question, of protection in Canadian waters against stib-narino attack is an extremely Important one and. one which very vitally concerns the Imperial Munitions Board as the munitions ships arc those which are most likely to be attacked.   It is understood, however, that the matter is now being dealt with oetwoon tho Admiralty and tho Canadian Government direct., .Apart from tho question of men, the most important helw filch Canada can give in&quot; tho War at this moment appears *&apos;;o bo-B10. sPIierc of finance.     This is a erection which will no ^ourc bo raised by the Treasury but as &quot;it condoms closely the imperial Munitions Board it is mentioned here.   Who value ofthe/
the total orders placed with the Shell Committee and the Imperial Munitions Board&quot;amount to about $700,000,000, ( 143,055,616).   Of this, roughly half has now been paid for leaving something- under $350,000,000 ( 71,917,808) to be met ill the future, most of which will fall duo for payment between now and July.   The commitments already met have been provided up to the end of Be comb or roughly as follows-.-   By the Imperial Government - 0192,000,000 ( 39,452.054).   By tho Canadian Government -&quot;$95;000,000 ( 19;520,547) - By the Canadian Bankers 0100,000,000 ( 20,547,945), the latter two figures representing advances to the British Government.   Che Canadian Bankers arc advancing $50,000,000 ( 10,273,972) additional in the first throe months of this year, the Canadian Government .025,000,000 and It is understood that Sir Thomas white, the Binanoo Minister has in mind if possible still further assistance to tho British Government. . Shore Is no reason to suppose that Canada is not in a position to provide such assistance0The population&apos;of the United Kingdom may be taken in round&apos; figures at 45.000,000 - the population of Canada at 8,000,000, The United Kingdom possesses no doubt, or did possess in the way of liquid securities greater realisable wealth per head than that possessed By Canada, and certainly has the advantage of a highly developed money market which facilitates large loan and credit transactions.   It is open to doubt, however, whether the actual wealth per head of this country is greater than the wealth per head in Canadac - But the financial sacrifices made by Canada during the Bar do not Begin to approach those made in this country.   Up to March 31st 1917 tho expenditure of this country to be covered by loans will amount to over  2,040,000,000. Shis figure represents tho money actually reeuirsd in the United Kingdom and does not include loans raised abroadc   It does net also include nearly the whole of the recent &quot;Jar Xoan hut only such amount of it&quot;as will bo recnired up to march 51st 1917. On the other hand, Canada has raised by loans in her Own country since the Beginning of tho Bar only 0200,000,000 ( 41,095,090) and of this amount,it is estimated that some portion, at any rate, has found its way* across tho Border into the hands of tho United States investors.By the end of March 1917 the United Zing&amp;om will have spent of monies raised by internal loan ever  53 per hoad - Canada will iave raised internally (unless By that time she has issued another loan) about  5 per head.,    On a basis of population she-would, if she had raised as mudh proportionately as the United Bingdom, have raised over  500,000.000 instead of  40,000,000,or over twelve times as much.Similarly as regards revenue, the attached appendix &quot;CTT will guvs tho comparison Between the extra revenue raised in this country since the beginning of tho Bar and the extra revenue raised in Canada.    It will he seen that while this country has raised over  471,000,000 Canada has raised about  6,300,000. If she had raised&quot;as much as tho.Unitod Zingdom proportionately to the population, sho would have had to raise about  83,680,000 or over twelve times as much as sho hascIt is not intended to draw from the ahovo figures any invidious comparison between the United Zingdom and Canada. The circumstances of the two countries have &quot;been wholly different and Canada has already done more in the way of granting&apos;credit than anyone before the War would have supposed Possible.   It is to Be remembered that until the Bar Canada had always been a debtor nation and had every year to Borrow many millions sterling from abroad for her expanding needs.   It 1-s
a revolution for her to change iron &quot;being a debtor nation to being a&quot;creditor nation, and the idea that eho can lend largely! even when the money is to he spent within her own borders, is naturally one which finds only a comparatively slow acceptance,   ITever tireless, the figures cuOted afford ground for hoping that should necessity arise, Canada will he able to do even more than all she has hitherto done in the way of providing credit.     It should not be forgotten that there aro positive advantages to her in being a large creditor of the British Government.   fho Banks will have a strong reason for advocating economy throughout the country, and tho money of tho population instead of being spent unproductive!-?, will be represented after the war by a largo capital sum repayable by tho British Government.Canada Is In a state of general prosperity owing to tho huge munitions orders and the very high prices for foodstuffs. In the fiscal &quot;year 1912-1.3 &quot;her Imports exceeded her exports by over $309,000,000 ( 63,493,150). &quot;in 1915-16 her position had so greatly improved&apos;that her&quot;exports actually exceeded her imports by 0285,000,000 ( 58,561,64.3) and her favourable balance of trade during tho year 1916-17 is very much greater. In addition she was able to borrow In 1916 from the United States in ono way or another through Governments, Ilunicinal-itios. Companies, etc. about ^200,000,000 ( 41,095,000).&quot; 2hrj Canbdian Bonk&quot;deposits&apos;have increased since Pov ember 1914 by over $230,000,000 ( 47,260,273),     Speaking of the duty of tho Banks to finance the orders for munitions, tho Chairman of the Canadian Bank of Commereo recently used the&quot;following 7-crds in a speech at tho annual meeting of his bank: -   11 If wo aro to execute the orders for Par supplies which -/ill be offered to us, and which it is our duty to undertake in order to aid in&apos;ensuring victory, wo must bo prepared to do very much more than herotoforen -Phis sentiment, which is general in Canada, Is in strong contrast to the advice recently given by the Pederal deserve Board of the United States and is a measure of the advantage of placing orders, so far as&quot;possible, within the hmpiro instead of in foreign countries.Imperial Munitions Board.6th March, 1917.
