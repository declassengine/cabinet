COPYSECRET.G.T.278 WAR CABINETOPERATIONS *General Hanbury Williams.Ambassador,repeated C.I.G.S. 23.3.17.895.Grand Duke Nicholas (? word omitted) this afternoon. In view of the necessity of acting correctly in support of new Government, we decided not to go to meet him officially, though Alexieff and senior officers of his staff went.     I then arranged to go privately at 5 o&apos;clock when he greeted me most kindly and affectionately.     I had a conversation with him in private result of which is that in my opinion, and as he authorised., me to say as a result of the conversation, it would be well if the British Government telegraphed you their views as to the necessity of supporting new Government in Riissia against the minority of the Government, and the Social -Democratic party, which is now making such difficulties, so that you might represent these views to Russian Government, and publish them if considered desirable.   I understand that member of Government is coming here to see Grand Duke to-morrow, meanwhile he remains in his car.   I am told privately that all stations on the way he had &amp; most enthusiastic reception. Chief of Military Mission dines with him to-night.   Meantime rny Prench colleague has gone to him with a view to communi-cating with his own Government, in the sense of my message to you.From:-To   :-
