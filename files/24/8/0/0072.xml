- 2^WAR   CABINET. *0 0Note by the President, Board of Trade, on shortage of pauer, with a Return of Stocks.sac I) The Royal Cora, lission on Paper has taken a Census b^pzihe stocks of paper held on behalf of the Newspapers in this country, and I attach figures summarising the result, of the Census.    Ihcy do not disclose any accumulation of stocks to the extent which has been suggested in certain quartersnSince these figures have been available. I have met a representative deputation of Newspaper Proprietors, and I think it may be taken that they were unanimously of the opinion that, short of an actual famine in paper, they were opposed to any interference with stocks or with the machinery by which each firm obtains its supplies. It is necessary, however, to face the fact that Uiere may be a great stringency as regards supplies of paper in the near future, and I think that the War Cabinet siiould have a knowledge oi the position,    I have not given any reply to the deputation, and should like to discuss this matter with the War Cabinet before doing so.A.
