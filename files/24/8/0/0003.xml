CONFIDENTIAL. Printed for the use of the Imperial War Cabinet.This memorandum deals with the co-operation of the Dominions with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the economic sphere. The War has shown the immense importance of the economic weapon. It has also thrown a flood of light upon the German economic policy and the ramifications of German influence in trade, both in foreign countries and in the British Empire. To counter this influence all the Dominions have passed Trading with the Enemy legislation, which differs in matters of detail but is based upon the broad principle that there should&apos; be power to prevent, not only commerce with enemy countries, but also trading.by firms within the British Empire which are manifestly under enemy control and trading with firms in Allied and neutral countries which are of enemy nationality and,association.The prevention of enemy exports, especially uncler the guise&quot; of. neutral goods, is a cardinal feature of the blockade policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. All the Self-governing Dominions have adopted the policy enforced in this country of preventing the exportation of enemy goods passing as neutral by requiring the production of British consular certificates of origin in the case of imports from neutral countries adjacent to Germany.It is, however, in respect of the disposal of their staple products that the co-operation of the Self-governing Dominions has proved most valuable in the economic sphere.Throughout the War the Dominions have done their utmost to place at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government their resources in the way of raw materials and to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in all matters relating to the exportation of their products, with the dual object of preventing the enemy receiving supplies of which they are in need and of securing that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Allied Governments receive the supplies of which they stand in need.All the Dominions have established prohibitions of exportation, differing, of course, from those established here, in accordance with the nature of the particular case, but intended to secure the two objects mentioned above, and in the adminis-tration of their prohibitions the Dominion Governments invariably consult His Majesty&apos;s Government in all cases (whether as regards individual shipments or as regards shipments generally of certain classes of commodities) in which His Majesty&apos;s Government may have suggestions to offer from these two points of view. The most important of these products may be grouped under the four heads (a) foodstuffs, (b) mineral products, (c) wool, hides, and skins, (d) materials for the production of glycerine.(1) For a long time large purchases of wheat for the use of this country and the Allies have been niade from Canada and Australia. In the autumn of 1915 the Canadian Government took steps, as a temporary measure, to requisition, on behalf of the Allied Governments, a large amount of grain. The Commonwealth Government created machinery during the season 1915-16 whereby the shipping and marketing of the entire Australian crop were entrusted to a Board of Control representing the Commonwealth and State Governments, working in conjunction with a similar Board in London. Further measures have now been taken, and arrangements have recently been concluded for the purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of 3,500,000 tons of Australian wheat. The possibility of securing for this country the exportable surplus of the 1917 Canadian crop is being discussed with the Canadian Government. Purchases of maize from South Africa have also been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) At a very early stage in the War steps were taken, both in Australia and in New Zealand, to secure for the United Kingdom and the Allies the whole of the available supplies of meat, viz., beef, mutton, and lamb.   The meat was purchasedRevise.   War Conference.-7398.      30, 50.I. Foodstuffs.
by the Board of Trade for the supply of the British and Allied armies in the first place, and the civil population of the United Kingdom as regards the surplus.(3) Large purchases of cheese have been made from time to time m Canada and New Zealand. The Board of Trade recently purchased the whole ot. the cheese available for exportation in Australia and New Zealand, and the possibility of similar action being taken as regards Canadian cheese is at present being dis-cussed with the Canadian Government. The intention, as in the case of meat, is that the needs of the Army should first be supplied, and afterwards those 01 the civil population.(4) His Majesty&apos;s Government have also recently made arrangements tor the purchase of frozen rabbits from Australia.II. Mineral Products.(1) Of the minerals found in the various parts of the British Empire, the most important from the point of view of the production of war material is nickel, a commodity of which Germany stands in particular need. Canada produces almost eighty per cent, of the worl&apos;d&apos;s output of nickel. The nickel ore is smelted into matte in Canada, but the final process of refining has not yet been carried out in Canada, and before the War the matte was sent for treatment either to South Wales, or to the plant of the International Nickel Company at New Jersey. From the very earliest months of the War the Canadian Government took steps to secure the safe disposal of the nickel matte supplied to the International Nickel Com-pany by the appointment of a Government Controller with access to the Company&apos;s books and premises. These arrangements enable the Canadian Government to trace the disposal&apos;of the refined nickel within the United States of America, while; the Company&apos;s sales to Europe are controlled by His Majesty&apos;s Government through their supervision over Messrs. H. R. Merton &amp; Company, who hold the Company&apos;s European agency. The Canadian Government have devoted particular attention to the possibility of Canadian nickel matte being refined in Canada, and refineries are being erected by both the International Nickel Company and the British America Nickel Company.(2) Another important mineral product is asbestos. Canada supplies about eighty to eighty five per cent, of the world&apos;s consumption of asbestos. The Canadian Government have prohibited the exportation of asbestos to all foreign countries, and allow exportation to the United States of America only for firms who have given a, guarantee that the asbestos and its manufactured products will be consumed in the United States or exported only to Allied countries, with the approval of one of His Majesty&apos;s Consuls-General in the United States.(3) Turning to Australia, the most important action taken with regard to mineral products has been that designed to free the Australian base metal industry from German control. The position before the War was that, by means of long-date contracts, the German Metallgesellschaft had obtained control over practically the whole output of Australian zinc, lead, and copper for a considerable period of years. The first action of the Commonwealth Government was to pass legislation determining all such contracts. Moreover, with a view to preventing the possibility of a recurrence to this state of affairs they have taken two important steps : \a) The establishment of a Metal Exchange having the sole right to handle Australian mineral products, membership being confined to persons of British birth domiciled in Australia. \b) The encouragement of a policy of treating Australian ores as far as possible within the Commonwealth. (4) As regards particular metals, it may be said that in general exports of metals from Australia have been confined to the United Kingdom and the Allies. One of the most important metals from the point of view of the manufacture of munitions, etc., is tungsten, which is required for the production of high speed steel.   The Commonwealth Government have taken over the supplies of wolfram at a standard price, with a view to their being sent to this country to be dealt with bv the Ministry of Munitions.   Similar action has been taken bv the New Zealand Government as regards scheelite, and by the Commonwealth Government as regards molybdenite (a substitute for tungsten ores).    It may be mentioned in this^con-nexion that molybdenite is found also in Canada.   Purchases of Canadian molyb-denite have been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Allies, and the
Canadian Government are allowing its exportation only to the United Kingdom and Allied countries.(5) Another important Australian metal is spelter. Although there were large supplies of zinc concentrates in Australia, this country was, before the War, dependent for spelter on foreign (and hminly enemy) countries, since the bulk of the Australian zinc concentrates were treated in Germany and Belgiunn The establishment of a British spelter industry is, therefore, a matter of cardinal importance. Negotiations, which are now practically completed, have been proceeding with the Commonwealth Government, by which (a)&quot;During the War His Majesty&apos;s Government will take 100,000 tons ofAustralian zinc concentrates at the rate of 8,000 tons a month, andmay, by giving notice, take an additional 50,000 tons. (b) After the War His Majesty&apos;s Government will take up to 45,000 tonsof spelter a year, and 100,000 tons of zinc concentrates a year for tenyears.Under these arrangements the bulk of the Australian zinc concentrates will be treated in Australia and the United Kingdom.Negotiations are proceeding with a view to similar arrangements being made in the case of Australian lead. The Ministry of Munitions has made considerable purchases both of lead and of copper in Australia.(6) The mineral resources of the Union of South Africa of use in war (except gold and coal) have hitherto been little developed, but there are large deposits of copper producing ores in the occupied territory of South-West Africa. These are being sent to the United States of America (the only country where they can advantageously be treated), on the condition that the smelted products are returned to this country.The War has shown the importance of the control of coal, whether supplied to ships as bunkers or exported as cargo. All the Self-governing Dominions have adopted the policy in force in the United Kingdom by which bunker coal is supplied to neutral vessels only if their owners have subscribed to stringent conditions laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government, or if they are actually engaged on voyages m the interests of the Allies. The exportation of coal cargoes from the Dominions is allowed only to reliable consignees. Moreover, the Union Government have recently taken steps to ensure that adequate supplies of bunker coal are available for ships using the Cape route, including the entire stoppage of exports of coal cargoes to foreign countries, or, indeed, to British destinations, except in cases of urgent necessity.(8) It may be mentioned, in connexion with the control of mineral products, that the Canadian Government have given attention to the possibility of the two Canadian companies which own the important deposit of iron ore at Belle Island in Newfoundland falling under American control. The situation is being carefully watched.III. Wool, Hides, and Skins.(1) Wool is a commodity of which the enemy stands in particular need, and which is greatly required in the United Kingdom and the Allied countries both for military and for civil purposes. From the earliest months of the War the Dominion Governments took steps to control exports of wool. During 1915 and 1916 exports of cross-bred wool (the type most required for military clothing) from Australia and New Zealand were confined to the United Kingdom and the Allies, and, to a very limited extent, to the United States of America; while exports of merino to the United States of America from Australia and the Union of South Africa were confined to firms approved by the Textile Alliance of New York. Further measures recently became necessary, and arrangements have been made by which His Majesty&apos;s Government have purchased the whole wool clip of Australia, and New Zealand. The Commonwealth Government have also taken possession of all wooled sheepskins, in order to ensure that the needs of His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied before those of other buyers.(2) Arrangements have been made to send to this country from Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand, all surplus hides suitable for military purposes.
* No,IV. Glycerine.(1) The demand for glycerine in the manufacture of explosives is large. It has been possible to obtain small supplies of glycerine from Australia, but more /-important are the materials from the use of which, in the soap and candle-making trades, glycerine is derived. The chief of these obtained from the Self-governing Dominions are tallow and whale oil. Tallow from Australia and New Zealand is allowed to-be exported only to destinations within the British Empire and Allied countries. It has been possible to obtain a certain amount of whale oil from Australia, while the South African production is either sent to the United Kingdom or used locally for the production of glycerine, thus reducing the amount of glycerine which must be supplied, from this country for the explosives required in the South African mines./ (2) Other measures have been taken in the Dominions to increase the local production of glycerine and to reduce the amount of glycerine which must ht obtained from the United Kingdom for industrial purposes. The Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand &apos;have taken steps to restrict to the minimum the use of industrial explosives con-&apos;tainirig a high proportion of glycerines The Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments have also prohibited the importation of foreign soap and allow importation only from Allied countries.It may rbe noted here that the Crown Colonies control the supplies of rubber, tin, plumbago, and, to a great extent, oleaginous nuts, which are a valuable source of glycerine., Details as regards them will be found in the separate memorandum^ on the assistance rendered by the Crown Colonies.Imperial Conference Secretariat, .13th March, 1917.
