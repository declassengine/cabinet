UTILISATION OA MAP-POWERMEMOEAEP-UP! BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY, TEESECRETARY 0F ST.&apos; TE APR PAR, TEE PRESIDSldAIR BOARD, APP THE MINISTER OP MUHITIOAS. We desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to theessential national services for which we are responsible.The requirements of the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Board, and the Ministry of Munitions for men in a state of sound physical health have at various times been laid in de-tail before the TP7ar Cabinet.    There is a lar5e outstanding, de-rnand, amounting in the case of the War Office and Ministry of Munitions to some hundreds of. thousandsfor recruits to eachWe are not concerned in this memorandum to discriminate between the demands of the services in point of urgency,    In this respect the situation may alter with circumstances from time to time.. But we are convinced that the maintenance of each service at proper strength is essential to the successful prosecution of the war -t and we are not&apos;satisfied that-the. reserve of man-power existing in this country is insufficient, if rroperly utilised, to the attainment of this end.Since at the present time the largest and most urgent outstanding demand for fit men is that of the War Office, the tendency is to draw men from work upon construction, ecuip-ment, and repair of ships (including merchant shipping), con-present position inre-era to the recruitment of.men for theservice;struct!on
-2-struction and repair of aircraft, and the manufacture of munitions (including processes ancillary thereto) into the ranks of the Army.The vacancies thus created in / these essential indus-tries have to he dealt with, if output is to.be maintained, by one or more of the following, means :- -*(a) by dilution of labour.(b) by the release of men from the Colours.(c) by the orovision of substitutes for the menwho enter the Army.As to the first means, dilution of labour is limited by the fact that certain processes actually require either a high de0ree of skill or a hi^h standard of physique and ability to withstand extremes of temperature or other trying conditions.As to the second means, the military authorities can-not contemplate any use of the process of release from the Colours which tends to deprive the Army of an effective soldier in return for every recruit who joins the Colours, The process is intended only to apply to cases where a man is definitely of more value to the nation if he is returned to industry than if he remains in the Army.We are thus driven to the conclusion that the pro-vision of effective substitutes is the only means by which:-fa) the Army can be maintained at proper strength; andfb) the industries on whieh the Army must eventuallydepend for the success of military movements and operations can be kept in full working.
-3-The Government have entrusted the duty of providing the fit men required for work in civil industry to the Director-General of Rational Service, whose scheme of voluntary enrolment has now been in operation for several weeks.We therefore ur6e that the. D.G.IT.S. should be asked at the earliest possible moment to sup-ply.the War Cabinet with a detailed statement of the number of men fit to act as effective substitutes now available under his scheme &quot; for Admiralty, aircraft, and munitions work, as compared with the numbers set out in the requirements submitted to him by the several departments.We hope that this statement will enable the War Cabinet to decide :-fa) whether the requirements of fit men for these services are likely to be met within a reason-able period by the system of voluntary enrol-ment now in force; andfb) if this is not so, what further measures should at once be initiated either by the D.G.K.S. or the Government in order to make fit men avail-able in the.numbers which are agreed to be neces-sary to the services covered by this memorandum.fSd) Christopher Addison&quot;   Derby&quot;   Edward.Carson, &quot;   Cowdray*March 22nd 1917,
