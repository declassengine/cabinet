LACK OF CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN ALLIED FORCES.

(Copy of letter from Captain Alfred Stead.(A.D.C. to Admiral Troubridge, to Prime Minister).

March 12. 1917.

Dear Mr. Lloyd George,

I must ask you to forgive my writing those few lines to you, but am anxious that I should place before you some essentially vital facts on the situation at Solonica, where I have been for the last five months as aide-camp to Vice  Admiral Froubridge.

There is an absolute lack of vision in the situation at Salonica; there is not even military imagination and far ? little military direction.  The various national forces find themselves divided into a series of isolated detachments strung put along a line of front, useless for mutual help or united co-operation. There is no co-ordination, there are no allied commander councils, nor has any allied  war Staff been created. Thus to-day the striking force of 180,000 men, many of them excellent troops, has no cohesion nor has its Commander-in-Chief  any plan for which to prepare. The only force with vision and ?eals is the Serbian, now reduced to 30,000 men.  Their vision brought them to Monastir and would have seen us in Veles before Christman 1916 had the French supported them and to-day they are again ready to go forward. The Italians are the most practically equipped and most systematically working force but there are only few of them. General Sarrail is a political general - not a military one - and knows that financial and economical success will please better his political supporters than military progress - a genius or an English commander with imagination might make a workable arrangement with Sarrail, a divisional general, oven a brilliant one from a military sense, can and does do nothing. And so the Salonica force is doomed to inactivity unless attacked; there is not oven organised work on the lines of communication, although these are vital for all advance. The Macedonian front finds us with superiority of men and guns, and being a battlefield of manoeuvres would enable us to draw full advantage from superior quality of infantry - whereas the war of deep entrenchments renders more equal the value of good and bad troops.

I have written more fully to Captain Hall of the Naval Intelligence, should more details be of interest or Admiral Troubridge could supply any information.

I am,

Yours sincerely,

(Signed) ALFRED STEAD.
