1/HS/231,22summary of blockade intelligenceMarch 16 - 22.IgvmjANJIJBaARIHE BIDQKADE.     The sinkings of merchant tonnagewhich were officially reported in the period March 16-22 are much less important than those of the previous week,0 Steamships (500 tons gross &amp; over)British   ...   34,007 tons gross. Neutral   ...   58.470   &quot;        &quot;0 Sailers (100 tons gross &amp; over):-Excluding smacks          British ... 104 tons gross,trawlers.                   Neutral ... 5,384   11        nGrand Total     91,965   &quot;        &quot; (Last Week 140.949)iQNiJAOE. Our import restrictions have &quot;been considerablymodified as the result of the Paris Conference.   To Prance and: to Portugal we have given way on the subject of vines and &quot;brandy; to Prance, Italy, Japan ana Switzerland on that of silks.    In these cases we shall allow import from each of the privileged sources of sfcnoly up to 50$ of the 1913 figures. &apos; The Spanish Government hope to force our hand with regard to oranges; they announce that vessels loaded with lead or mineral will not be allowed to clear from a Spanish port unless they reserve lOf, of their cargo space for fruit.Our difficulties in respect of tonnage have led to a continued depletion of the hunker-coal derots on the Atlantic routes.   Thus the stocks at Punchal were 10,000 tons &amp;n Feb. 1. and have now fallen to 5,000; those at Buenos Aires have fallen since Feb.9. from 10,000 to 4.500.      Vessels calling at St. Vincent
    -are now only allowed coal for the voyage to Las Palmas or Teneriffe.   We are putting strong pressure u^on Dutch and Norwegian shipowners to carry coal for these and other Atlantic depots on outward voyages.Six Danish vessels with produce cargoes have safely accomplished the voyage from Bergen to England; and regular shipments may now be expected.   Fifteen other vessels have left Copenhagen for England; and tM new shipping company formed &quot;by Mr. Andersen for trade with the United Kingdom has now a respectable fleet. We have engaged ourselves to insure half the value of the hulls.As we anticipated last week, the Danish Govsra-ment are most anxious to obtain British coal, knowing that otherwise they must obtain German coal at the price of extravagant concessions.   Already there has been a conference between the Danish and Germaat railway authori-ties to arrange a scheme of coal transport;   it was settled that Denmark should receive immediately 1,500 truck-loads of coal for the use of public institutions, on condition of supplying truefes and engines and allow-ing them to be used to oarry loads &quot;of any description&quot; (possibly German troops and war-material) on the journey southwards.   The Danish authorities are furthermore recruiting labour for the German coal mines; 1,000 hands have already been sent to Germany and 7,000 more are said to be awaiting orders.     They are to receive 10 kroner a day, and also their food which will bedespatch ft daily from Denmark.     On the wh^le English coal will prove the cheaper bargain, and we are taking
steps to supply it.   Some coal-cargoes which were detained in British ports have been released, and every produce boat which reaches the United Kingdom will he allowed to take back coal.ffe are also releasing by degrees, as the produce boats arrive, the detained cargoes of fodder-stuffs and fertilisers.   We expect the Danish Government, in return, to reduce the exports of live and slaughtered cattle to Germany;   the total has already been limited to 7,000 head per week, and we hope for a further reduction.   In the last week of February the exports were 7,064 live cattle and 1,280 carcases.The Germans are receiving large quantities of fish through Denmark from the Swedish and Danish fish-ermen.   2he Danish Government have removed all restrictions upon the export of fish;   and the Germans now supplying Danish fishing vessels with petroleum on condition that no part of the catch is sold to us.   We are not prepared to buy Danish fish on any considerable scale, but we may do something to restrict German pur-chases by undertaking to supply petroleum in larger quantities than Germany can spare.There is no substantial change in the Swedish political situation.   At present the King will not dismiss Mr. Hammarskjold, whom he regards as the last barrier against the influence of the Bngllsh and the Socialists,    he Socialists and the liberals are , clamouring for a real agreement with England, and for a Cabinet which will be guided by the majority in the Riksdag.   If we were not the Allies of Bussia the
crisis would by this time have been settled in our favour.   Perhaps the need for British ooal will in time outweight even the mistrust of Russia, which is the most inveterate prejudice of the Swedish public. Germen coal is arriving in insufficient quantities and must now be fetched from Rotterdam in Swedish bottoms.This ooal shortage is not however an unmixed ad-vantage to the Allies,   it has been made the excuse for suspending the Russian transit traffic;   and it is likely to impair the productive power of the establish-meats which provide us with iron, steel and other mili-tary materials.   We are offering 6oal cargoes to all Swedish vessels which bring approved cargoes to the United Kingdom.   But the insurance difficulty is not yet settled.In view of the frequent Norwegian sailings to this country, it is lamentable that Norway should be tltill receiving insufficient supplies of British coal. Sir M. Bindley blames the intricacies of our coal-control and shipping control;   he thinks that we have too many committees who write too many letters and impede each other.The Norwegian fish-catch is comparatively small this season, and the season will end earlier than usualI We appear to be controlling the market, except in the extreme north.   Up to date we have bought 62% of the spring herrings.     The fishermen complain that they are running short of petroleum through our action in res-trioting imports;   and the Norwegian Government allege that In this respect we have violated the Jfish Agreement
under which we promised the fishermen all necessary supplies, subject to certain guarantees.   Ho doubt the Norwegian Government would welcome an opportunity of repudiating the Fish Agreement, which is a main cause of the strained relations between Germany and * Norway. he negotiations for the requisitioning of Norwegian ships have made progress.   There is some haggling over terms, and the shipowners insist that no requisitioned Norwegian ships shall be put into trade with Norway for fear that the Norwegian Government might be coraoelled by Germany to seize and detain them.   Sfhe shipowners are pr ob&amp;bly right; and if we obtain enough Norwegian tonnage for other trades, it will be a simple matter to use British vessels in our trade with Norway.Sir M. Findlay thinks it is a mistake to Insist thet all vessels bound from Norway to the United  ing-dom should put in at Bergen.   3Jhis port is overrun with German agents who sometimes get hold of the sailing instructions and sometimes stir up disaffection in the crews.,JTCIIDSKUNDS, Ihe Dutch Government are definitely refusingthe hospitality of their ports to armed merchantmen whether British or American,   It is clear that they have been intimidated by Germany.   For the present we are granting no clearance from British ports to my Dutch vessels but those which carry fertilisers andfood-stuffa,   We have also refused convoy to Dutch vessels making the voyage from Holland to this country.
- 6 -Patch shipping is still inactive.   The insurance premiums demanded in the Dutch market are prohibitive; the German insurance companies would never aclaiowledge their liability for ships and cargoes sunh by sub-marines;   and Dutch owners think that, if they insure with British Companies, their ships will at once be specially marked out for destruction.   The question of requisitioning the Dutch ships now detained in British ports will probably be considered at an early date by H.M. Government.Allies was signed at Berne on the  1st inst.The question of purchasing the surplus stock of Swiss cattle is still under discussion.   The Swiss insist of reserving 30,000 head for the purpose of exchanges w;ith Germany under the new German-Swiss Agreement;   but if we males no purchases Germany will get 100,000 head.   M. Cochin, who at present objects to any scheme of purchase, has been invited by HAM. Government to discuss the matter anew.   %anwhile we propose to prevent the Swiss from importing cattle; they are said to be purchasing stock in America.The persistance of the French in blacklisting German-Swiss firms against the terms of the Agreement is causing considerable embarrassment to ourselves and to the Italians.&amp;BCB* 3?he Allied Representatives returned to Athenson the 19th inst.   But they recommend that we should proceed cautiously in relaxing our control over the internal trade of Greece.HTZSftLAKP.The new agreement between Switzerland and the
The British Insurance market has been authorisetl to cover the vessels which the Greek Government has requisitioned with our leave for the purpose of provis-ioning Royalist Greece and Venizelist Greece with grainf The Greek Government is dilatory in making arrangements for the grain supply and there are fears of a serious shortage.KITED rgATEB,       While Mr. Wilson watches the trend of American opinion, his administration seems disposed to antioi-pate his decision.   She State Department are arranging that their war-orders shall be so placed as not to hinder the completion of our American contracts; and they have taken the advice of Sir It. Crawford as to ways and means of hampering the&apos; enemy&apos;s financial operations.   It is significant that, on March 15, Messrs. Speyer of flew Yorfc notified their jfrankfurt house &quot;prefer discontinue   bueiness transactions with Germany&quot;.   They were one of the few American financial houses which continued to do German business on a great scale after the beginning of the present crisis.The State Department hope that for the present we shall add no more American names to the Statutory Black List.     Shere are pro-German agitators who would welcome an opportunity for starting a new campaign against Great J3ritain.H. W. 0. D.AR TRADE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT.23rd March, 1917.
