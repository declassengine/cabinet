/ fSECRETWAR    CABINET.Meat Supplies, (Memorandum by Sir R.H. Rew, Ministry of Food.)The requirements and estimated supplies of meat for the Allied- Armies in the first half of 1917/ ana the quantity of chilled and fresh meat left for.the civilian population are stated by the Board of Trade as follows:-British Army French Army Italian ArmyBritish civilian suppliesRequirement s^ Tons . 210,000 154,000 60,000SuniDlies.T on s . 201,000 149,000 62,000 96.000The deficiency in Army supplies almost exactly corresponds to the quantity of meat lost s.% sea. The War Office anticipate a deficiency during the next six months;&apos; and. there appear to be two alternative proposals for making this good:-(l)    To appropriate the whole of the refrigerated meat, now allowed- for civilian requirements, to the Army.(2)    To draw upon home stocks.- .VIt appears it has also been suggested that for immediate requirements stocks no?/ in cold store should be appropriated for immediate use by the Army,The Food Controller has consulted Sir Thomas Robinson, who stated that the present contract with the River Plate Meat Companies,, for the purchase of 50,000&apos;&quot; tons of meat per month for the Allied Armies, is based, on the. understanding that the Government will allot 20% cf such tannage as is available; for the carriage of meat for the contractors&apos; ordinary trade. The tonnage available has never been sufficient to bring the full contract quantity, and consequently the contractors have seldom had more than about 8,000 tons per month to dispose of. Sir Thomas Robinson urges that to break this understanding may lead to the termination of the contract and the demand for higher prices.     The prices under the present contract are fixed for the duration of the War, and for six months thereafter-The quantities of meat in cold, store on the. 1st March and the 1st February respectively, as ascertained from returns collected by the Ministry of Food were as follxws;-	March 1st	February	Tons	Tons .Beef (Chilled &amp; Frozen)	20,600	22,900Mutton &amp; Lamb		(Chilled &amp; Frozen)	27,200	22,600Bacon	25,800	25,900Hams	10,500	10,100Rabbits	900	800.Poultry &amp; Game	2,800	2,000Other Meat	10,600	13,500Total Meat	98,400	97,800
These stocks appear to he no more than sufficient as a reserve against irregularities in the arrival of shipments which would cause disturbance of the markets.     Any depletion of them, therefore, would be unfortunate,  and the maintenance of the imports and of these stocks   is highly desirable if possible.There are no direct returns of the number of cattle slaughtered each year, but it is estimated that the present annual rate of-slaughter represents about 20^ of the number returned in June.      Of the total number returned one-third represent the milking herd,  and, unless special measures are taken, the milk, supply will be very quickly affected.     The enforced diminution in the supply of com centrated   feeding stuffs will reduce the average weight of animals slaughtered * which is now estimated at 672 lbs. dressed carcase weight. Assuming that the average weight wefe reduced by 10% and the numbers killed were the same, there would be a less of about 160,000 tons of beef.On the other hand,  there is evidence that the adoption of the voluntary ration of moat is already materially affecting the consumption.Supplies entering the Central Market, London in February show a reduction from a weekly average of 7152 tons last year to 5793 tons this year, a decrease of 19$,     records do not appear to be kept at provincial markets with the same oom-pleteness as at London, but the Ministry of Food is arranging for the collection of uUoh statements    as are available. Manchester reports a. reduction of 20 to 25% in sales of meat during the last four weeks as compared with last year,  and Bristol, Leeds, Hull.,- Newcastle,  Glasgow and Edinburgh also report reductions&apos;,  though precise figures cannot be given. Frcm a few markets,   e.g, Aberdeen, Birmingham and lirkenheadr the indications are doubtful.It would be unwise to make any confident estimate of reduced demand, but present indications show that taking the country generally a reduction of 10% is not too sanguine. On this basis the civilian requirements for meat would be reduced by about 240,000 tons per annum.It is suggested that any scheme for purchasing home supplies for the Army requires to be carefully arranged,   so as to avoid undue inflation of prices in.the local markets *As regards supplies of feeding stuffs it may be noted, that the statement of shipping requirements for foodstuffs for,the six months, March to August 1917,  submitted by the Food Controller,  after consultation with the departments con-cerned, to the Tonnage Priority Committee on the 3rd instant, included 550,000 tons of maize intended to replace the loss on milling offals,  due to the operation of the Milling Orders. If this quantity were not imported.,  or were used for bread, the total imported feeding stuffs required would be reduced by about 1,000,000 tons,  as compared with the previous year. The Food Controller is making a demand to the Shipping Resources Committee for the importation of largely increased quantities of breadstuffs to establish a reserve, and this demand may further reduce imports of feeding stuffs.Returns collected by the Ministry of Food showed that the quantitiy of barley left unmalted in the hands of brewers and maltsters, when malting was stopped on the 20th February, was approximately 2,000,000 quarters.     Of this 1,600,000 quarters were actually in the maltsters&apos; and brewers&apos; stores, the remained being either on passage or in port granaries..
The Food Controller at cnce requested the Wheat Commission -to take steps to secure at least 1.000,000 quarters of this &quot;barley to be hold as a reserve of breadstuffs until the middle of June.     The method adopted by the Wheat Commission to secure this object is to offer to buy at such a price as will pre-vent it being offered for feeding stock.     Whether this method will most effectively secure the main object in view of securing a reserve is still under consideration, but in the meantime it is undoubtedly effective in preventing these stocks from use for other than bread-making purposes.Ministry of Food, (I-iiti .11-1)    B.
