TACTICAL VALUE OF TAHKS.       The main value of Tanks -lies in their power of assisting the advance of infantry- in. the attack.     Three types of machines- should he employed, heavy,, medium, and light.     The, heavy type includes machines of. &quot;between
15 and 30 tons in weight; - the medium from 6 or, 7 tons to aweight not exceeding 15 tons;   the light includes types offrom 4 to 6 tons In weight&apos;.    ...The ,latter:.shouldtbe made as lightas possible as the French contemplate transporting them onordinary lorries,The necessity for a medium-weight tank, not exceeding15 tons in&apos;weight, is that, where the permanent &quot;bridges overrivers and- canals ;have; been, destroyed, . it could cross thetemporary bridges constructed in their place.    If however the-weight of a tank is limited, its baseband-consequently itspower of crossing obstacles, are; also limit.ed;-    Therefore: bothheavy and medium&apos;, types.&apos;, are required..  - A. further advantage - ofthe-medium tank-is its convenience.&quot; f-br&apos; transportation.     The&apos;heavy type&apos; cannot be-&apos; carried by ordinary railways wagons,, andinconvenience and delay may be caused by having to-, collect; thespecial wagons required for.: their transportation^FQMS. Off ATTACK-.     There are two forms of attack which, it; isnecessary to consider:-(1)-.   A surprise attack without previous artillery bombardment&apos;... ..--.   v   .(2)   A deliberate attack after thorough artlXlery bombardment,;   ,; - -   -Experience shows the difficulty of concealing preparations for an attack&apos;,&quot;&apos; aiid:&apos;it&apos;is&apos;&apos;therefore improbable that we shall have opportunities for&quot;the  irst. form ofoperations If,, howev-er, we possessed- a very large number of Tanks&apos; and the conditions of the ground favoured concealment, -great results.might be: obtained by their use in such an attack., . . ;&apos;,       - ..In- the conditions: at present prevailing on the-&quot;Western front&quot;,., however,, the main object of tanks must be to assist&apos;,th;e.&apos;. .,infantry
infantry advance in the ordinary form of&quot;attack where the operation^ has he.en :previo&apos;usly&quot;-prepared r%^&apos;&apos;Ar-tillery &apos;lDOJubardVnent * In this&apos; case it should-be the aim of the-tanks to enable the infantry- to press .on &quot;beyond the effective support of their own artillery into the enemy&apos;s&quot; rear lines of-defence,PQICMJ&apos;fiM^0^^&quot;AIP-&apos;IX3PJ;QYliGT^Tg.. -/ The measures for the concentration and deployment of tanks on the front, of attack- are as follows :-.   - . A detraining, point &apos;is--selected-at a sufficient distance,probably from 10. to&quot; 12. kilomatres, from the enemy-Is lines, - From here.. the tanks: will move- to- the-place -of assembly at-a&apos; distance of. .5 -or 6, kilometres from :the detraining-point.&apos; &quot;-Here-a depot of the-necessary stores/and spare parts and a rep-airing section - are .-established.   &quot;Previous to the attack the tanks are moved up ; to-, one or -more- starting .points in the infantry -1-ih&apos;e.&apos; - &quot;-The exact position- of: these points. depends on circumstances; -   I;n case of a surprise- attack,, where the tanks precede the&apos; infantry-,&apos;they must he.ready in position close to the front trenches.and must be moved up by night or under cover of a fog-, great&apos; care being taken to conceal these preparations.     In the normal form, of attack, where infantry protected by artillery precede the tanks,  concealment is just as necessary, but by reason of the fact that such an attack may not; start until some hours&apos;after .dawn, tanks must be prepared to start, very much farther back, even up to 3 kilometres from the front line.     If this is not done there is danger of their discovery during the hours of daylight with the result that surprise is lost for both tanks and infantry.,and the latter is probably subjected to hostile barrage before, the hour of zero. l^l&amp;M^Iiv ACfelQH.&apos;. ..The infantry division is the chief fighting,&apos; unit.     It has a definite zone of action in the attack with definite objectives assigned to it.     The action cf the tanks-must
be co-ordinated with that of the divisions.     The tank units are generally at the disposal Of the Array Commander:    &quot;but the tank unit operating with any division of this Army is. during the attack of this division, under the orders of the divisional commander.Let us suppose the front of attack of one division is 1,600 metres as an average.     Two companies on that front must be specially attached to the two tank units (800 metres per group) operating with that division, in order to assist the tanks in crossing obstacles, trenches,&apos;etc.The tanks will not, under normal circumstances,  come into action until the infantry advance is checked by the enemy1s&apos; strong points which may still be holding out in parts cf the German line, and which have not been subjected to sufficient artillery&apos; bombardment *The :tanks then do the work which the artillery has been unable to accomplish.     They move forward in lines of columns and then deploy on coming into action.     They destroy machine gun emplacements,  cross barbed wire, and thus bring on the infantry after them in the later stages of the attack, and enable them to carry the successive enemy lines of defence,The tank commander must assign some point where the tanks can reform after the attack.QRGAITISATIOH\     Theoretically, an ideal organisation for a tank group &quot;;ould be&apos;, proportionately,  one heavy aiid one light machine to three or four 2:&apos;.ediumJ the light machines for the Commanders of the group and of the batteries of which it is composed.     There are, however, practical difficulties in the way of effecting it as regards the heavy machine,  as the French at present have only the medium and light types.
il 6 UR0U5S 0? DIjTF3R?j;T?--7YP5S 0?  aikcs.     The principles governing the employment of heavy, medium-.and-light machines are as follows;?-In an -attack .where success&apos;--depends &quot;hot on the -element .of surprise-,-or on - sup error-.-moMll.ty&apos;.&apos;but ^solely&apos; on weight&apos;--of numbers and weight : of. metal,&apos;.-, -heavy&quot;or -medium tanks must foe used,-In a surprise attack on a. &quot;strongly&apos; -entrenched- line, where -the- tanks-precede the infantry/.. medium -machines-&apos;-onaccount&apos; of -their greater mobility would be required to overcome the wire and -crush the enemy1s resistance.   &quot;There   are, moreover, other cases -Where-the.lighter types would be.of greater value than&apos; the heavy. For-instance, after a successful attack./when the enemy has been forced-out of - his main positions, a reserve&apos;of medium andiight -tanks (i medium, f light-.) which can be rapidly --brought :up&apos;will be most useful in continuing-the attack.    -In the defensive also light -tanks-which -can be quickly brought up to supportNi^ counter?-at tack would be :extremely eff.ec.tiye.    -In open warfare especially 1 the qppqrt-uniti-es for Light-tanks would b&quot;e &quot;very great-,     $nk -French authorities also intend usingtheir -light -type as an &quot;armoured motor car for commanders to visit the battlefield in order to main-tain supervision ..of the progress of operations-.   The respective employment of the three types depends on the amount of mobility required and-the nature of the co:unttyr.ARKAMET.      In general, half the tanks should be armed with 7&apos;5 m/m. guns and half -with raa.ehin-e-.guns,. The representatives cf the British General Staff, while concurring generally in the principles advocated in the preceding paragraphs by General 3stienne for the tactical employment of tanks, drew attention to the following points:-
Q R 1(l) , The paramount necessity of careful reconnaissanceof. the ground and the effect of such reconnaissance on the. tactical role assigned to tanks in any- particular . operation, .(2) - British experience indicates/that it is better to-allot the tanks to a Corps front,  controlled&apos;by the Corps, than to have a detachment oftanks definitely&apos;-&apos;: : allocated- to a division and the ,plans drawn up by the &apos; divisions independently., as contemplated by General . Sstienne.... (3)   The armament depends on the type of tank and the uses. to which they; are-put.     A proportion.0;f fifty per cent .being.armed with machine guns .only was agreed to.in   -order to suit manufacture, and sufficient experience: -has not: been gained as. yet to warrant a- definite opinion on this, point-.;. - .-&apos;..:. .::   -  Lieutenant Colonel Stern and Sir E.Tcd JEyncourt, -representing, the-lllnistry-. of. Munitions, rai sed the question of the &apos; use of tanks-.as .an. indejiendenti-arm and of restricting their employment to ground-not previously subjected to heavy bombardment. Lieutenant Colonel Stern ..pointed out that light tanks might perform the role- of cavalry.in attacking the enemy&apos;:s gun positions.It was -also pointed, out., by Sir 2,x. df3yhcourt that figures given at the Conference showed that, when first used., 23 out of 49 tanks went forward successfully;    that is 47 per cent. At that time the crews were almost without training-, the tanks had not the various improvements which will be embodied in the Mark IV, and the ground was almost impassable&apos;.     &quot;With the thorough training nor. acquired by the crews and with the improvements which had been effected, he considered there was no reason why a very large. . percentage
percentage should not go forward successfully..     He wished to lay special emphasis on the fact that they may he regarded as a reliable arm;    and the view, which had been mentioned at the Conference, that the infantry regarded them as unreliable and imperfect,  should be combated and discouraged in every way;    the rank and file.-especially should &quot;&quot;be encouraged to have confidence in. the machines.     It should not be overlooked-that to a great extent they can carry their own supplies, ammunition, food, water.e.tc., for, a considerable periodj and are therefore largely independent of supplies coming up from behind, as would be the case with advancing infantry.     A surprise attack with tanks supported by infantry mights therefore be. made with less preparation, and to a greater depth.He added that in considering.the new designs for the future he would propose, to keep in. view the possibility of . thickening the armour, at.nny rate, on the more exposed portions, in order.to resist - attack-by guns more powerful than the present German machine guns.The general opinion of the Military Members o-f the Conference on these points was that the mechanical reliability and speed.of.tanks were not yet sufficiently developed to enable. them, to act   independently, of infantry and- that., it was premature to regard,them as an arm which could,-under present conditions, perform the work of cavalry.     It was recognized that ground.which had been-heavily shelled was often-,impassable by,Tanks., but it was pointed.out that the real role of the Tanks was to support. the infantry advance in its. later stages when preparation by artillery was wanting and when the tanks would in fact be operating over ground-which had.not been heavily bombarded. Careful reconnaissance of the lines.of approach should also minimise the extent to.which they&quot;are required to cross badly -shelled
shelled ground.- The Deputy Chief of the Imperial- General Staff in -summing up,, asked General Istiemie whether he agreed to&apos; thefollowing conclusions-:- :;(.1)- That for the present the role of the. Tanks must he- . regarded, as. that of assisting infantry to win- the- &quot;battle, .... either with&apos;or without artillery, &quot;bombardment * -(2)    That as a general-;? principle Tanks were required, to assi-st infantry at points where&apos; the artillery bombardment had not succeeded in-overoomjng the enemy5s resistance, and that consequently. Tanks, would be chiefly required&apos; to enable the infantry to-&apos;gain their more distant objectives,   ,. (3) &apos; That occasion for,the..use of. Tanks in a surpri scat tack might-arise,- when-large -numbers&quot; were available and the ground was particularly. suitable\for concealment. : (.4)   ;That&quot; all three types of-Tanks had: their uses, &apos; and-that designers&apos; and-manufacturers should continue-to make . and improve&apos;1 all - three.General Sstienne and the other members of the Conference concurred in - these conclusions.,
