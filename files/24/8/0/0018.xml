Report-for week ending 15th March, 1917.THE PRIME MISISTER.The following Report covers the work of the National Service Department (except Recruiting of Volunteers which is the subject of a separate Report), for the week ending 15th March, 1917. Secretariat.(a) STATISTICAL DEPARTMENT. The total number of persons enrolled as National Service Volunteers up to Thursday night is 141,465, of whom. 23,033 have enrolled during the week.   This is slightly higher than the number of the previous week.The reports as to the results of interviews at Nation-al Service Offices are now being received, but they are not sufficiently complete for statistical analysis.(b) CENTRAL INFORMATION BUREAU.       Enquiries are still numer-ous, and relate, in the great majority of cases, to questions affecting the Restricted Occupations Order.     The difficulties which have arisen in connection with this Order have been largely removed by the permission given to Employment Exchange Officials to issue a certificate entitling National Service Volunteers to he employed in Restricted Occupations until such time as they are called up for duty.(c) CLERGY DEPARTMENT. Arrangements for dealing with minis terial offers of service are now xn operation, and a memorandum of instructions is in course of preparation.Up to date, 438 general service enrolments have been received from clergy in the Church of ^nglanjr.
&apos;&quot; 2 &quot;The appeals of the National Free Church Council have been sent out, but the results are not yet known.(d)    PASSPORTS DEPARTMENT.The number of applications for passports examined up to date is 4,171.       During the past week 300 have been considered, and of those a recommendation to issue was made in 220 cases and 80 were refused.(g)    GENERAL.Leaflets for the guidence of employers and of volunteers respectively have been prepared, and are ready for issue.The total inceming mail for the week has been 22, 852 letters of which 11,885 have been for the Women&apos;s Section, and 10^967 for the Men&apos;s Section.     The number of new correspondents has been 13,354.vThe Despatch has included 7,930 letters, 420 telegrams, 28,972 Circulars and 6,898 parcels.THE LABOUR ADVISER1S work has included theFollowing:(a) The arrangements of the Mass Meeting of Insurance Superintendents and Agents held on the 12th March (the result of which has been to enlist their aid as describedin the Report upon enrolment of Volunteers submitted separ-&quot;&quot; &quot; -ately), . \(b) The arrangement of the Meeting of Trade Unionists held on the 14th March.(c) The reception of numerous deputations which raised many objections to the National Service Scheme most of which have been dealt with through the Labour Advisory Com.
!Iill, THEATRICAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS,r       - ....        a: !The Committee of the Enleri^aijame^rts Xruiu^try men.- . tioned in last weekfs Report is engaged in collecting exact information as to the Man Power engaged in this BusinessiIV, SUBSTITUTION,The fresh scheme for Substitution referred to in last week&apos;s Report is still under consideration by this Department and other Departments concerned&quot;.In the meantime Substitution is being carried on as hither-to by the Officers previously engaged in that work.   At present no more men are being taken from Agriculture for the Army but the duty of *Agriculture to the Army is not being lost sight of.      The Agricultural Section has been in consultation with the Boards of Agriculture on the subject.V, AGRICULTURAL SECTION.. *(a)   Military Labour.     There have now been placed on the land in Scotland 858 skilled ploughmen, temporarily released on furlough from military Service, while other soldier labour with general agricultural experience to the number of 299 has also been placed upon the land.The Military Companies for Agricultural purposes which are now being established in Scotland will prove useful for the less skilled operations of the later part of the season.        In the meantime it is proposed to train them to some extent in agricultural work, and to use them also for necessary work on the roads and in the cutting of timber..
(b) TRACTOR DRIVERS.     In the course of the week six additional tractors drivers have been supplied to the Board of Agriculture in Scotland, and a number of motor men who offered for motor-ploughing in England have been sent back to the English Board of Agriculture to man their tractors.(c)   Appeal for Ploughmen.     The result of Mr. Turner&apos;s appeal to the Municipal Corporation and the County Council of Scotland has been that to date 209 ploughmen have been temporarily offered for service by these Corporations, lien have been offered by the following Municipalities:-Edinburgh, Glasgow, St. Andrews, Ayr, Alloa, Troon, Lcith, and by the County Council of Roxburgh and Midlothian; while letters have been received indicating that other Corporations are taking action in the matter.In the letter of the 14th liar oh to this Depart-ment, the Commissioner for Scotland, states: &quot;You may rest assured that no single farm in Scotland need go without its requisite number of ploughmen for this sowing time&quot;.The appeal to Corporations in England and Wales will apparently also lead to good results.     Seven plough-men have already been offered by the Borough of West Ham and arrangements made for their being placed, while com-munications from various other Boroughs - such as -Margate and Blackpool - show that they are likely also to release all men who arc temporarily available for service.
(d)     Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners for England.The vacancies for the Sub-districts referred to in last week&apos;s report have now been filled, and the whole of the Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners have ent-ered-upon.^ v their duties v/hich are being prosecuted vigorously and with satisfactory results..It is hoped that their co-operation with the Board of Agriculture and the County Var Agricultural Com-mittees will effect complete provision of labour for plough-ing and seed time.VI.      General Trades Section.    It is regretted that Sir John Hewett, the Director, has been obliged to resign on the 9th March owing to ill-health,.The work done during the week may be summarised as follows:(a) Classified Lists of Trades.   The list of Trades of Primary Importance and the Restricted Occupations Order continue to lead to much correspondence.(b) Conferences.(.1)   Conferences have been held with other Departments as follows:--With the Food Controller on Economy in Food.i?       &quot;   Priority Department on Priority Scheme.&quot;       &quot;&apos;   Board of Trade on Certificates for exporting Goods under Priority Scheme.&quot;ith the Var Office on Utilisation of Military Vaggons for relief of transport difficulties.rith the Ministry of Munitions on Leaving Certificates. (2)   Vith the National Federation of Fruiterers, Florists and Fishmongers on the organisation of the Trade for Notional Service purposes.
(3)     The Section has attended Conferences 3ield try the Reserved Occupations Committee with representatives of the Plumbing, Leather Goods, and Chemical Trades. (4)     The Section also attended a Conference in the 1?.&apos;ool$n and r:orsted Trades summoned by the Director General.(c) Forms.     The Section has assisted further in the preparation of Forms to be used by Sub-Commissioners, Em-ployment Exchanges, Employers and Volunteers in connection with the Classification and Allocation of Labour and the payment.of allowances to Volunteers.(d) Lieans of Appeal.       The Section has assisted in draw-ing up a scheme for appeals by Volunteers and Employers.(e) Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners.(1)     The Section attended a conference of these Officers and held separate meetings with them.(2)     The Commissioners in general report good progress being made in enlisting the support of local Authorities, in the creation of Local Committees   ad hoc   and in the business of those Committees in the way of personal canvas and house to house distribution of Enrolment cerds and other Literature,(f) The investigations into particular trades mentioned in last week&apos;s report as having been begun, has actively proceeded, and frequent consultations with the Reserved Occupations Committee have been held.(g) The Suggestions Branch continues to receive evidence from various Trades as to the good results in the way of setting free Labour that would be derived from Co-operation between Tradesmen and from some well organised scheme of Part-time Labour.
BUSINESS CONCENTRATION SECTION.During the week the Section has been engaged in various negotiations including the following:--(a) Stock and other Exchanges.(1)     In general these offer part-time service b^t-very few of their men can enrol for whole time.

A Deputation from the Fire Offices1 Committee, representing 55 Offices, was received by the Director General and informed that forms N. S, V, 1, may be filled up for &quot;non-manual work&quot; and that means of Appeal would be set up available for Employers or employed.v:0M NrS SECTION.(a)    ALBERT HALL MEETING.       During the past week the energies of the Women&apos;s Section have been in a groat measure concentration on preparations for the Albert Hall Meeting.      The Meeting has not been arranged with a view to making any general appeal for &apos; omen&apos;s Service, but as a demonstation, and as affording an opportunity for state-ments and explanations as regards the general po-sition of &quot; omen1s Work. - -.
