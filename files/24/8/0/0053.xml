3 E C 3 SJ?g?irp GPPPLY 0? CS5I&amp;AI.S jggHIH BB3 j^IiS., (Memorandum &quot;by tlio President of -tho Board of Agriculture &amp; FisheriesThe d-end of .tho united . ingdom for cereals, &quot;both for hvman and animal food, during tho continuance of tho war is urgent. It will not bo diminished cither in volume or in. urgency air the conclusion of peace     But the claim which this country nr.kos on the -;TOrld&apos;s exportable surplus of c&amp;l-cals may be narrowly limited &quot;by tho competing demands of tho countries now at vrar.     It therefore seems do si ratio to investigate the sour cos of the supply of cereals within tho Empire, in order to take such steps as may be possible to secure to tho United Kingdom quantities adequate to its requirements both during and after the war*Imports of grain may be divided into:-(A) SJhosc cereals which are partly produced in tho United Kingdom, and(3) yiiosc cereals which arc wholly imported.As to (A), cereals partly produced in tho united kingdom, the present position is as follows.     In wheat tho homo production is one-fifth in quantity of the national requirements;    of tho remaining four-fifths, approximately one-half comes from within the Empire.     In barley, tho homo consumption in 1916-^was in round figuros 11 million quarters.     Of this total nearly 6-j millions were grown at homo.     Of the 4P% millions imported, one-third was produced within tho Empire.     In oats, tv/o-thirds of tho national requirements are produced in this country;   of the remaining one-third, approximatoly one- fifth comes from within, tho /Impure.As to (B) ocreals which are wholly imported, maize is the most Important.     v/ith tho exception of imports from Africa, the amount consumed within tho Unitod Kingdom is mainly impoi-ted from foreign countries, chiefly Argentina and the United States of America.     Millet is also imported in small quantities, mainly from India.     Rico is not included in the   -omorandtun.w 0oroa.3i3 -partly produced at home.(i) &apos;mmiT  &quot; . &apos;       &apos;As to wheat, the main sources of supply within the Empire are, (l) Canada, (2) India, (3) Australia.&quot;(1) OAIABA,Canada &quot;already produces nearly one-third, and in 1915 more than one-third, of tho total who at supnly of the &apos;British Smpiro. Tno acreage under wheat in Canada in 1915 was 12,986,000 acres, -and tho yield in round figures was 47 million ouartcrs.     In 1916 tiio wheat acreage was 12,879,000 acres with a yield in round iiguros of 27$ million quarters.     But the now area available for wheat and at present untouched by the ulough is considerable. A conservative estimate places its extent at 14 million acres, iho normal yield of wheat per acre in Canada is slightly over 19 bushels:   that for 1915 was abnormal and approximated to 29 busiiols per acre.     But difficulties of access, transport, and possibly labour, together with the risks to tho crop from black rust, and, in the nor thorn districts, from frost, may ihafcco any large additions to the area of wheat Improbable without some sPoci&amp;i stimulus.
It is suggested that , if not too late, the Canadian Government might, on behalf of the British irovernment , offer a price on the Lakes for all sound, marketable wheat harvested in 1017, which would be sufficiently tempfcing to induce a large addition to the/wheat area.     The cost of production of spring sown wheat  in Canada before the war has been estimated at about 13 dollars per acre.     The figure is much disputed.     But a suggested price would be 55&apos;/- on the Lakes, or prnctically 50/-at&quot;&apos;the door of the farmer,      It  is suggested for considerat ien whether a similar offer mhght    not be made for the year 1918*(2)    INDIA.No increase in the production of wheat  in India can as an immediat e measure be obtained except by one of three methods. l) Extending b*r means of irrigation the area which is at present uncultivated,    2)    By subst.it ut ing wheat for other crops.    3) By substituting other food stuffs for wheat for native consumption e,g. rice, millets, maize and barley.The first method is narrowly limited, the second requires careful considertt ion as the principal crop which would be displaced, is cotton;     the third might possibly release a con-siderable quantity of wheat for export.It  is suggested that  if the Home Government were to guarantee to take a certahn quant it y of Indian wheat  in excess of the amount normally exported,  it would induce cultivators to grow a larger quantity for export.     Indian wheat  is sown in October or November, and. the suggest ion is made in case the crop reports of Canada for the harvest of 1917 which would be available some time before those months should piove unfavourable.(3)   As to AUSTRALIA, no suggestion is made.      The principle suggested for securing a supply of wheat  in Canada has been already adopted to a limit est extent, at  a price of 38/- per quarter for 1916.Three other possible sources of supply may be mentioned, (4) Egypt.  (5) Mesopotamia, and (6) Africa.(4)  .EGYPT.In Egypt four-fifths of the total area cultivated is capable of growing wheat,     But  so long as cotton remains a highly remunerat ive crop, and t he long staple Egyptian cotton remains of special value to Lancashire mills, the area assigned to wheat, (1,553.000 Egyptian acres in 1914-15), is not  likely to be ext ended except under   Government direction.     The yield per acre could,however, be considerably increased by improving the strains of seed, and the use of nitrogenous manures, if availables In view of the considerable demands which Egypt wkll have to make on the world&apos;s export able surplus of wheat harvested in 1-9 1917, two suggestions are made for considerationcda)&apos;  Wheat  is sown in Egypt  in December and harvect ed in the early summer.     Por the December sowing in 1917, it  is suggested, that such&apos;an area as in normal years would make Egypt  self-sufficing might be allocated to wheat, even if the withdrawal of the area from cotton diminished the output of that  crop-?(b)   The production of wheat  in the Sudan has increased
considerably in recent years.   Further extensions of the wheat area and also of the cotton area depend on the completion of irrigation works, and the Irrigation of nsw areas of land. The works have been suspended during the war.    Special atten-tion might be called to the schemes-for irrigating the river -side land in the provinces of Berber, Dongola, Haifa and Khartoum, and especially to the scheme for irrigating- the Gezira plain between the Blue and White Nile&quot;south of Khartoum which was estimated to irrigate 3 million acres at a cost of 3 million pounds.    It is suggested that this and ether schemes should be at once investigated, with the view of ascertain-in g whether an immediate&apos; outlay of money on completion or partial completion might net make the. Sudan self-supporting as to wheat, and possible supplement the wheat supplies of Egypt.   It may be added that the development of the Gezira scheme would also assist in the solution of the problem of Out cotton supplies- of the long staple type. P(5) MESOPOTAMIA.In Mesopotamia,  the completion and opening- of the Hindia barrage in. December 1913 have,  it is.understood, made an area of 600,000 acres^ available for cultivation.   It is difficult to obtain infoimation on the subject.   But it is suggested that,  in view of recent military developments, this possible source of supply might.be worthy of immediate attention.   The soil is said to be extraordinarily fertile, and is undoubtedly suitable for.cereals. - (6) AFRICA. &apos;From the Union of South Africa,  British East -Africa, Uganda and Northern Nigeria,  no exportable surplus cf wheat can be reasonably expected.    It may, however, be suggested that efforts should be ma.de to render them self-supporting.In the Union of South Africa, the production of home-grown wheat has not kept pace with consumption,  and there is a large annual import of wheat and flour.   In the other territories enumerated, local requirements are met.   But it is suggested that in the East African Protectorate, the experi-ments of the Department of Agriculture   in evolving disease-resisting varieties of wheat adapted to local conditions should be pushed forward in order to extend the wheat indus-try.(2) EARLEY.Before the war the principal importing country was Russia, and the countries which were of next importance were India, United States, Turkey,  Rumania,&apos; and Canada.    In 1916, India and Canada supplied a third of the imported barley. The figures in cwts,  are as follows:-Home consumption Ai3.9, 438, 438 cwts.Home Production 23,616,300 cwts. Imports 15;822.138 cwts.39,438,438 cwts.Of the imports 9,028,500 cwts. came from the United States.2,868,100   &quot;       oame from India. &quot; 2,832,600   &quot; came from Canada.14,729,200 cwts.
With the restriction on brewing, the home production of barley might meet the normal consumption-on the reduced war&quot;figures of&apos;last year.   But barley is valuable for human food, though it doos not admit of such close trilling as wheat, and as a feeding stuff it is almost escout la] to tho rearing of pigs. Any increase, therefore, in the supply which could be obtained from cither India or Canada would be of nc^tional importance.(3)    0 a ToAs to oats, Canada has become one of the chiof oat exporting countries of the world. In 1915 tlio yield amountod to&quot;65 million quarters. It is possible that, hero again, and by the same, methods as wore suggested&quot;for wheat, supplies for the United Kingdom might be increased.(B)   Cereals wholly imported.(DM a i z m.As to maize, the chief sourco of supply is at present Argentina and tho United dtatos of America.   But tho immediate prospects of a groat increase of supply&apos; from Africa are good, Dhey depend on&quot;an increased acreage under maize, an increase^ yield por aero, and the local demand for maize in order to develop tho cattlo-raising industry in South Africa.She Union of South Africa possesses a largo area which is so favoured in rospect of soil and climate as to bo oapablo of growing tho finest maiso in tho world.   Tho aroa suitable for maiso cultivation has boon ostimatod at over 13million acres, of which slightly over 3 million acres are now under cultivation for tho crop.*Improvements in methods of cultivation, and especially the omplo2?mont of ploughing machinery would greatly increase the yiold por aero,Tn.o natural tendency of the Union will bo to encourage her cattlo-raising industry.   But thoro is no reason why tho two industries should not flourish together and help ono another,   Moreover the meat trade is still in&apos; its infancy.     In tho interval before its full development,&apos; there is room for a groat oxtension of maizo in tho country.It may bo too &quot;late in manjr districts.   But, where action is still possible, is is suggested that an offor on tho part of the British Government to xaxo a specified quantity of maize at an agreed price would supply tho necessary stimulus to export.,Clio same suggestion applies to Pdiodesia, the East African Protectorate and Nigeria, in all of which maizo iS alroady grown and the area, as woll as tho yield per acre, is capable of extension,(2)   MILLS r.IPor human food, millot is a very nutritious grain,
whether used in the form of groats or of flour mixed with wheat flour in &quot;bread.-    Its value is very close to that  of barley, being a little higher in starch and lower in albuminoids.      It is, as compared with riec, rather higher in albuminoids and oil, and lower in starch.     For \ivcr-&quot;5t ock, its feeding valuo is also little inferion to that of maize, and it is a useful horse-corn, Supplies might be increased in (l) India,  (2) the Sudan,  (3) South Africa.(l)    From India exports of millet  (&quot;jowar&quot;) aro already made to the United Kingdom.     In 1914-15 the quantity imported from India was 12,^00 tons.      It  appears certain that the quantity could be considerably increased, if there was a regular demand.The Provinces in which millet is chiefly produced are Bombay, Madras, Central Provinces and Berar.     The time of sowing and harvesting varies with the locality.      In Madras,, Central Provinces, and Berar, it is chiefly sown in June and July, and harvested in November and   December.    , In Bombay the greater part of the crop is sown in October and November, and harvested in February and March.It is suggest ed t hat if the Home Government off erred to purchase quantities of millet at  an agreed price for the next t^o or three years, a considerable quantity of the grain would be available for export to this country,(2)    In the    Sudan millet  is known as &quot;aurra&quot;,    As bread flour, the African produce  is infer: cr to Indian miller, but  it can be prepared for human food in various ways.     The crop is very varyingc     In 1914 the Sudan Government was an importer to meet the nat ive needs;    in lp 15&apos; it was a laigo exporter.     Two crops a year are &apos;obtainable in some aisuiicts..     Thus in Pongola :&apos;durra&quot; is sown in June and September, and the crops harvested in September and December respectively.     Two crops are also grown in Kassala andTokar, the dates of sowing varying from July to October.It is suggest ed $-hat efforts should be made to increase the production of &quot;durra&quot; in the Sudan, though it  is uncertain whether any large quantity could be obtained for oxport to this country.     But Egypt  in recent years has not been frblc to meet its own requirements&apos;, and, frlom this point of view, an exportable surplus in the Sudan Would be valuable.(3)    South Afirica.     Here a millet, allied to &quot;durra&quot;, ia known as Kaffir corn.     Between five and six thousand tons &quot;/ere imported from South Africa to the United Kingdom in 1915. It is chiefly grown by the natrve population^     Bit an increased supply could Pe obtalnec. in considerable quantities, if an external demand at romuneiative puces were created&apos;.Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. 22nd March, 1917.
