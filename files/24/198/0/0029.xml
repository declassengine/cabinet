[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    28CP. 329 (28).CABINET.PROPOSED EXPERT COMMITTEE ON THE OPERATION OF DOMINION    LEGISLATION AND SUB-CONFERENCE ON  MERCHANT  SHIPPING    LEGISLATION.      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    THE Cabinet approved in February 1927 (Cabinet 9 (27), item 8) the proposalswhich I made (CP. 426 (26)) regarding the preparatory action to.be taken in regardto the recommendations of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the ImperialConference, 1926, as to the setting up of an Expert Committee on the operation ofDominion legislation, and  a Sub-Conference on Merchant  Shipping legislation.  Inaccordance  with the Cabinet  decision,  an  inter-departmental  Committee was constituted  to make a preliminary survey of the ground,  and a telegram was sentto  the Dominions intimating that preliminary material  would be  prepared, andwould be circulated to the Dominions when available.    The task of  the inter-departmental Committee has proved to be one of greatercomplexity than was at first anticipated, and their labours have thus been prolongedconsiderably beyond the time at which it was  hoped that their report would  becompleted.  In the course  of my visit to the Dominions I was questioned by eachPrime Minister on this subject: the matter was raised again by Mr. Mackenzie Kingon his recent visit to London, and I have also received several enquiries  from SouthAfrica.  These enquiries relate both to the date when the Expert Committee and sub-Conference may be expected  to meet, and also to  the circulation of preliminarymaterial.    At  my request the inter-departmental Committee are preparing two  sets  of papers,  the first containing their  recommendations  for  the consideration of theGovernment here, the second containing, in a form suitable for  issue to the Dominions,a summary of the existing state  of  the law on the various topics  with which it isthought the Expert Committee and Sub-Conference will have to deal.    These documents are nearly in their final shape, and it will, I hope, be possiblefor me to circulate  them to my colleagues before the end of November.    I feel,  however, that we ought without further delay to  communicate with theDominions  as to  the most  suitable date for the meeting, of the proposed Committeeand Sub-Conference.    Obviously, this date should be one which would enable the  work of the Committeeand Sub-Conference to be concluded  in time for their  reports  to be considered at thenext Imperial Conference : this involves consideration of the  date at which the nextImperial Conference can be held.    In view of the general election next year it would not,  I think,  be practicable to hold the Imperial Conference before at any rate the early part of 1930.  But I  see no objection to  arranging for  the meeting of the proposed Expert Committee and sub-Conference in the early autumn of next year; their  deliberations might thenbe expected to be concluded in time for a meeting of the Imperial Conference in 1930at whatever time of the year may ultimately prove to be generally acceptable.    I should like,  therefore, to have the authority of the  Cabinet for the despatchof a telegram to  the Dominions in the sense of the&apos;attached draft (Appendix (A)).    The question  of the  place  where the meetings of  the Committee  and Sub-Conference are to be held also requires consideration. It seems to me that there is      [18399]
a good deal to be said in favour of arranging for the meetings to be held elsewherethan in London, for the following reasons : -    (1.) It is desirable on general grounds to emphasize  the  principle that work           connected with an Imperial  Conference may equally well be done in           any of the Dominions as in this country.    (2.) The subject-matter to be considered at the meeting of the Expert Committee           and Sub-Conference, though  it covers a wide field, yet really depends           on a small number of general principles of importance,  and should not,           therefore, call for the presence of a large number of technical experts from           this country.    (3.) Holding the meetings in  a Dominion  such as  Canada, where there would           be a considerable section of public opinion averse from any drastic changes           in existing  constitutional arrangements,  might  serve to  have some           restraining effect on the Canadian delegates and indeed  also on the more           extreme  of the other Dominion delegates.    (4.) If the reports of the Committee and Sub-Conference were in a form difficult           for the Government here to accept, the latter would be in a much better           position  to  refuse to accept  them or  to insist on  modifications  if the           meetings had taken place, not in London, but elsewhere.  Both reports           will be  of  course ad  referendum  and  are  intended  to come up for           consideration at the  next  Imperial  Conference.    On the other  hand it may be urged (and this is a point of very great importance)that the issues at stake are such that the delegates of Great Britain at the Committeeand Sub-Conference must be of the first rank (and include, at least, one legal repre-sentative of high standing),  and that it would be  impracticable to arrange for a delegation of sufficient authority to serve  the occasion to be absent from this countryfor the time (say three months) necessary for  the meetings of the Committee and sub-Conference.  There  is the  further consideration that the  delegates of GreatBritain,  whoever ,they  may  be,  might  be  embarrassed  if  they  did  not havethe fullest opportunity of consulting with the Government as a whole.  As against this, however, it must be remembered that the Expert Committee and Sub-Conferencehave primarily to deal  with the legal, not the political, situation; and the point setout at (4) above must be taken into account on the other side.    If the Cabinet  should  decide that it is  worth while  at any rate  to ascertain whether there would be a feeling in favour of holding the meetings elsewhere thanin London, the best procedure would seem to be, at  the time of the issue of the pro-posed telegram (Appendix (A)), to instruct Sir W. Clark to sound Mr.  mackenzie king  privately on the question whether the Canadian Government would be willingto propose that the meetings should take place at Ottawa.  It would seem properto give the first opportunity to Canada as  the senior Dominion.   I may mention that,in 1920,  the Canadian Government  proposed that a meeting of  the ImperialConference should be held in that year  at  Ottawa.  There was a general feeling against this at the time, partly  on the ground of the inconvenience of holding any meeting of the Imperial Conference that year.  On the other hand, I remember therewas considerable support in the Dominions for  the idea that the constitutional conference (which was at that time contemplated) should be convened in Canada.                                                                   L.  S. A.    Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W.1,               November 1,  1928.
APPENDIX  (A).                         Draft Telegram to Dominions                      (to be sent to the I.F.S.  by despatch);    ...... October, Confidential.  Circular A, No. .......  My telegram 18th February,1927.   Following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister.   Begins :    Proposed  Expert  Committee on the  operation of Dominion Legislation and sub-Conference  on  Merchant Shipping Legislation.    Preparation of material referred to has taken much longer than was anticipatedowing to complexity of subject matter, but we hope that it will be possible to circulatepreliminary documents in about a month&apos;s time.    In view of this, we have been considering possible dates for meeting of Committeeand Sub-Conference, and relation of such dates to that of  next meeting of ImperialConference itself.    As you know,  general  election is due here  next year.   Exact date  is  stilluncertain, but  it now looks as though,  so far as we are concerned, next meeting ofImperial Conference could not very conveniently take place before early part of  1930.    This suggests that from our point of view most appropriate time for  meetingof Expert Committee and Sub-Conference would be the early autumn of  1929.    Such a  date would allow a good margin for preliminary study of documents,and also enable  Reports of  Committee and  Sub-Conference to be  ready  in  timefor consideration by Imperial Conference  at whatever time in  1930 proved  to be generally acceptable.    We should be grateful for your views  on above suggestion as soon as you  havehad opportunity  of considering it.  Ends.
