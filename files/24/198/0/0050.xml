[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;g  Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  July 1928.SECRET.Copy  No.61898-B.(Also Pap&amp;r No. C.O.S. 174.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.POWERS  AND  AUTHORITY  OF  THE   COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF  IN                                   CHINA    BY direction of the Prime Minister we considered at our 73rd Meeting, held onthe 6th July, 1928, the question of the powers and authority of the Commanders-in-Chief in China.  We were informed that the Prime Minister wished to be satisfiedthat the powers and responsibilities of the Naval and Military Commanders-in-Chiefwere defined and correlated sufficiently to ensure the  avoidance of a breakdown incase of imminent danger.                        ....  -    2.   By his standing  instructions,  which are common to all Naval Commanders-in-Chief abroad, the Commander-in-Chief,  China,  can order naval movements  atany time, in  a case where  British life  and property  are at  stake  and requireimmediate naval interference. It must be noted, however, that this is only possiblein the case of river and coastal ports to which His Maiesty&apos;s ships can be despatched.    Special instructions  have also been conveyed to him in the following terms :           &quot; In view of the rapid changes in the situation in China  and the increasing    number of occasions  on which His Majesty&apos;s ships and Merchant Vessels flying    the British flag are being subjected to hostile action on the part of one or other    of the contending forces  in China, His Majesty&apos;s Government have empowered    the Admiralty to authorise you,  at  your discretion,  not only to reply  to fire    directed against  His Majesty&apos;s ships, but to take retaliatory action whenever    fire is directed against any  ship flying  the British Flag.  You therefore have    full  discretion to take such action against the offender with all the forces  at    your disposal, if necessary supplemented by landing parties for the purpose  of    destroying forts or guns guilty of  such action.         (2.)  For this purpose you are  authorised  to  draw  upon the  Shanghai    Defence  Force for any troops you may  require and which the  General  Officer    Commanding, Shanghai Force, is  able to spare  for this purpose.         The  War   Office  are  issuing  instructions  to  the  General   Officer    Commanding accordingly.&quot;             (Admiralty  Telegram No. 812  of 11.5.27.)         &quot; (3.),His Majesty&apos;s Government have further decided that you  should be    authorised to take immediate punitive action in the event of outrages which          (i) endanger the lives of British nationals.   Such action is to be confined              to cases where British lives are actually placed in imminent peril;         (ii) endanger British property, when there is actual deliberate and wanton              destruction of property.        In all cases not covered by (i) and (ii) above, or where the  violation of rights    only is in question, punitive action is to be taken to restore such rights only after    the prior sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been obtained.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.[17928]
         (4.). Iii so  deciding, however, you should in each case that may arise be     guided by the following important considerations :             (i.) In all measures of. retaliation authorised by you, it is to be borne in                mind that the sole object is to prevent the recurrence of the action                giving rise to it by forcing the  Chinese authorities to  assume and                carry out  the responsibility,  which properly belongs to  them, for                affording adequate protection.  Any proposals  of a wider scope or                with any other purpose will still  require particular reference to and                sanction by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;                    (Admiralty Telegram No. 813 of 12.5.27.)        &quot; (ii.) The punishment inflicted should  in no case be  excessive  or  out of                proportion to  the gravity of the offence.         (iii&apos;.) Action should preferably be taken against military objectives, such as                forts, barracks or military headquarters.         (iv.) The selected  objective  should, as far as possible, be situated  in the                immediate vicinity of the site of the act owing to which retaliatory                action is determined upon.          (v.) In no  case should action be taken at a place remote from the scene of                the outrage.         (vi.) Due consideration must, in all cases, be given to the  safety of innocent                civilians, and, so far as possible, the punishment inflicted should fall                on the real offenders.&quot;                    (Admiralty Telegram No. 814 of 12.5.27.)         &quot; (vii.)  Any military^ operations undertaken must be strictly limited, in               character, and of such a nature that they do not necessarily involve               Naval or Military undertakings on an extended scale.&apos;         The extended powers which you are now  authorised to employ emphasise the     importance  of your  maintaining the closest touch with the  British Minister at     Peking and with the Consular  Authorities at the various ports,  and of the     urgent  necessity  for  apprising His  Majesty&apos;s   Government,  through  the     Admiralty,  of any action authorised by you under these extended powers.&quot;             (Admiralty Telegram No. 815 of 12.5.27.)         &quot; Now  that Major-General Duncan has arrived, he will  be responsible on     shore for the protection of British lives and property at Shanghai, and can call     up, for this purpose, such reinforcements of the Shanghai  Defence Force that     may be temporarily retained at  Hong Kong.  His Majesty&apos;s Government con     tinue,  however,  to  regard you.as their principal Military  adviser upon broad     questions of policy  connected with the safety of British lives in  China.  In     placing this responsibility on you, His  Majesty&apos;s Government are assured that     you will continue in the closest co-operation with General Duncan.&quot;             (Admiralty Telegram No. 543 of 28.2.27.)     3.  We  are informed  that,  as a result of  Foreign Office telegram to PekingNo.  568 of  the 5th October,  1927, and  Admiralty  telegram  No.  310  of  the9th November, 1927 (copies of which are attached),  dealing  with the  situation at hankow, Admiral Tyrwhitt inferred that his authority under Admiralty telegrams nos. 812 to 815  had  been extended, and that he had authority to move  troops from shanghai to other parts of China and to replace them from Hong Kong.     4.  After discussing telegram No. 568 with the Foreign Office, however,  theAdmiralty have wired to the  Commander-in-Chief informing him that Admiraltytelegrams Nos. 543 and 812 to 815 set forth the authority and powers  confided tohim by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that Foreign Office telegram No.  568 mustnot be construed as extending  these powers.
    5.  In the circumstances, we are of opinion that the powers and responsibilities of the Naval and Military Commanders-in-Chief in China are defined and correlatedsufficiently to ensure the avoidance of a breakdown in  the case  of imminent danger.The  Commanders-in-Chief  are  acting in the closest  co-operation,  and  are, weunderstand, themselves satisfied with their existing instructions.    Their  instructions,  in our opinion, are adequate for any contingency that islikely to arise.                            (Signed)       H. TRENCHARD.                                           CHARLES  E. MADDEN L4.F.).                                           G. F. MILNE (F.M.).    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,                                    ,           July 25, 1928.                               Enclosure No. 1.      Cypher of Telegram to  Sir M. Lampson, No. 568, of October 5, 1927.    &quot; COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF&apos;S telegram to Admiralty, No. 1499.    We are opposed to formal repudiation of Hankow Agreement (see my telegramNo. 561), and to resumption of control of the concession unless  this latter course isforced .upon us.  In view,  therefore, of Commander-in-Chief&apos;s opinion that untillow-water at any rate any crisis can be best met by despatch of war ship, as it wouldbe inadvisable to land  troops  unless we intended to retake  the concession, and ofGeneral Duncan&apos;s opinion  that not less than a battalion should be sent in case ofemergency (which could not be accommodated on board ship for any length of time),we think it would be better entirely to discard for the present any idea of despatchingmilitary units to Hankow.   Should  emergency arise, involving danger to life,  theCommander-in-Chief already has full authority under  his standing instructions totake such  measures as he  may deem advisable.  This might include,  if necessary and practicable, the detachment from the Shanghai Defence Force as such troops as theCommander-in-Chief may require to supplement his available  force  of marines ifhe considers that this is inadequate to meet an emergency, arising whether before or during low-water  season, but  these  troops would be accommodated on board ship and would be employed in  all respects as marines.    Repeat to Commander-in-Chief  and General Duncan.&quot;                               Enclosure No. 2.Copy of a  Telegram from Admiralty to Commander-in-Chief, China, No. 310,  of                              November 9, 1927.    &quot; YOUR 628.  In view of your personal telegram to First Sea Lord, No. 344, of12th August, as Royal Marines are urgently required at home, transport arrange-ments have already been made for their return  in P. and O.  S.S. &quot; Mantua &quot; sailing from Shanghai 6th December, which cannot be  cancelled without involving consider-able expense, also despatch of stores and winter clothing having been cancelled itis regretted their retention cannot be approved.  The last paragraph of your telegram628 is not understood,  as Foreign Office telegram No. 568 gives you full authorityto detail military forces from Shanghai Defence Force to meet emergencies elsewhere,and General Officer Commanding has authority to replace  such  forces from HongKong (vide Admiralty  telegram No. 285 to you).&quot;
