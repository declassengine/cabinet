JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS                     AND THE FIRST  LORD  OF THE ADMIRALTY.     THE Foreign  Office and Admiralty have, in accordance with Cabinet 46 (23),Conclusion 3, examined the extent to which  the  American Navy co-operated with  theBritish Navy during the  Great War in exercising the rights  of search and  blockade,and have come to the conclusion that  the American Naval Forces  did not act on any occasion in  a  manner  contrary to  the   policy expressed by  the United  StatesGovernment  on Belligerent Rights prior to their entry into the war.     This  opinion  was also expressed  by  the International Law  Committee,  1918,presided over by Lord Cave, who in paragraph 26 stated:          &quot;The question of the &apos; freedom of the seas&apos;  is one of the fourteen points     forming the basis of the proposals of peace with Germany enunciated by President     Wilson,  and, although His Majesty V Government have made reservations upon it,     doubtless the United States Delegates will wish to raise a discussion on it.         It  does not appear that the United  States Government  is  estopped  by its     conduct during the present war from doing so, as, since they became a belligerent,     although they  have materially assisted  the  enforcements of the  Allied blockade     policy, they have done this by means of  municipal action in regard to restricting     exports ; their naval forces  have not taken part in the patrol, and, so far as is     known, they have not made any seizures of neutral or enemy ships and have had     no case in their Prize Courts.&quot;     The opinion expressed  above  is  explained  in  greater  detail in  the  attachedMemoranda  A. 5775/1490/45 of the  3rd December, 1925, and A. 5775/1490/45 of the18th November, 1925.     The extent to which the policy of the United States may be expected to march withthat  of His Majesty&apos;s Government is given in Paper No. B.R.  20  which, together withthe Admiralty Memorandum No. B.R. 14, to  which the former paper refers, is attached here to.     In view of the lack of any  action by  the United States Naval  Forces or PrizeCourts in the late war to support the policy desired by His Maj^ty&apos;s Government, weare of the opinion that the above-mentioned  paper B.R.  20 gives as accurate a view as can be obtained of the attitude which the United States Government is likely, at thepresent time, to adopt at a Conference  on the subject of Belligerent  Rights at Sea.

     [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.CONFIDENTIAL.     (12932) [A 5775/1490/45]                   No. 1.        Memorandum respecting United States Co-operation in the War.    THE extent to which the United States Government,  after their entry into the war, associated themselves with the methods followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in enforcing upon neutrals the observance of the blockade of enemy countries was one of the subjects discussed by the International Law Committee.  This  committee, which  held its first meeting in  January  1918,  was formed on the invitation of Lord  Robert (now Viscount)  Cecil,  and  was composed of  representatives  of  the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Foreign  Office, War Office and  Procurator-GeneraFs Department,  together with Sir J. Macdonell and Sir H. Erie Richards, under  the chairmanship of Viscount Cave.  The terms of reference  were  &quot;to consider what additions  and amendments would be desirable in the interests of Great Britain to the established rules of international law on the subject  of the conduct of hostilities, whether those rules rest on treaty or custom.&quot; At a meeting of the committee held at the Home Office on the 18th December, 1918, regarding the question of the &quot; freedom of the  seas,&quot; it  was pointed out that at the time of entering the war the United States  Government had  made  it plain that,  though they  would not object  to  the continuance of methods against which they had protested when  neutral,  they could not be expected to take any part in applying them.  All that  could be said was that the United  States Government  had  acquiesced in their continued application. Indeed, the very drastic municipal legislation enacted by the  United States Govern- ment to check assistance to the enemy could hardly have been maintained without the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s  Government and the  British navy in  preventing neutrals from driving holes through the blockade where they  w^ere beyond the reach of the municipal legislation of the United  States.  As regards the routine work of the blockade, either in the North Sea or elsewhere, no  assistance was given  by  the United States naval forces; they  appear  to have made, no seizures of neutral ships, and no proceedings were taken in the United States prize courts.   The International Law Committee considered it important that the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the discussions with the United States representatives regarding  the &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; should  be made aware that  the United  States  Govern- ment after entering the  war had abstained  from any  action directly inconsistent with the views they had contended for when neutral.    2.   The general attitude of the United States in this  respect is illustrated by the negotiations in 1918 for a joint agreement of the Associated Governments withthe Netherlands  Oversea Trust.  The United States Government were quite ready to insist on the most stringent conditions to be undertaken by the trust in  the case of goods exported or  facilitated by the United States to Holland, but they could not  in view of the strong  attitude  regarding neutral  rights  and  trade with  otherneutrals, which  they  adopted before  they ceased to be neutral adopt the same provisions as the other Associated Governments in regard to  the control  of imports into  Holland  from  other neutrals  or   from  the   Dutch  colonies.  They  fully appreciated, however,  the great value of the Netherlands Oversea Trust,  whose influence they desired to strengthen as far as possible.   Accordingly, if the other three Associated Governments made with the trust the strictest  possible  agreement to cover goods of any origin, the United  States Government would,  on the resump-tion of general negotiations with the Dutch, adhere to such an agreement,  since theywould then be able to insist, as part of a general arrangement with the Netherlands,on a control by the trust of imports  from other places than America,  and  could thus meet the  difficulties already  mentioned  in connection with their previousattitude in.regard  to the trust and limitations of belligerent rights.    3.   While,  however, the United States Government, as a belligerent, always appear to have borne in mind  the necessity of abstaining from actively participating in blockade measures against which they had protested as a neutral, there are certain features of the blockade with which they  can be said to have associated themselves, and, in certain cases, which they appear  to have enforced to  an  extent at variance with the attitude they adopted before they entered the war.      3355  [18320]                                                   B
     4.  Even before they entered the war, the United States Government may besaid to have acquiesced in an important factor  in the  rationing principle of theblockade.  It was due  to  a suggestion in December 1915 from the United Statesconsul-general in London that a scheme (which was mentioned by Lord Robert Cecilto the United States Ambassador and to Colonel House, who both seemed favour-able) was drawn up providing for the issue of &quot; navicerts,&quot; or letters of assurance,by the British Embassy at Washington,  so that shippers of goods from the UnitedStates would obtain some measure of immunity from interference with their goodson the high seas.  One of the advantages of the  scheme, from the point of view ofHis  Majesty5s Government, was that the  more the United States Governmentacquiesced in American exporters seeking permits for goods which  would not beheld up on the ground of contraband, the more difficult it would become for them tocontest the validity of the  British Order  in Council of  the 11th March,  1915.Moreover, the system of letters of assurance became a very valuable instrument in theapplication of  the rationing principle of  the blockade, a  principle  of which theUnited States took full advantage after entering the war. It will be remembered inthis  connection  that,  in their  protest of the 5th  November,  1915, against theblockade measures of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the United States Government asa neutral raised  strong objection  against any interference with goods  intended tobecome incorporated in the &apos;&apos; common stock &quot; of a country and maintained the rightto sell goods into the general stock of a neutral country and denounced as illegal andunjustifiable any  attempt of a belligerent to interfere with that right on the groundthat it suspected that the previous supply of such goods in the neutral country, whichthe imports renewed or  replaced, had been sold to the enemy.     5.  After their entry into the war, the United States Government  co-operatedmore and more closely in Allied measures for the control of shipments to and from neutral countries bordering on Germany.   They became represented  on variousAllied  organisations  controlling  the  blockade  of the   Central  Powers the contraband Committee, which, inter alia,  directed the seizure or release of vessels and  cargoes intercepted by the naval patrols; the  Allied Blockade Committee,  towhich questions of principle were referred by the Contraband Committee, and whicheventually absorbed the latter body;  the Rationing and  Statistical Sub-Committeeof the Allied Blockade Committee, and the Allied Trade Committees  set up in thecapitals of the northern neutrals.    6.  The co-operation of the United States in the war enabled the conduct of theblockade to be strengthened enormously and increased the  means of bringing pressure to bear on  neutrals.  The Associated Powers were placed in control  of by far thegreater part of the world&apos;s  supplies as a means of  securing a reduction of neutralexports to  the enemy and an increase in the neutral tonnage allocated, to Alliedservice.    7.  It was some time before the measures taken by the United States Govern -ment as a belligerent became effective.  Eventually, however,  they placed  an absoluteembargo  on all  exports  to  Scandinavia  and Holland, and  refused practically all exports to those countries in order to bring pressure on them to conclude satisfactoryagreements as to the export of their own home produce to  the enemy.  In conformitywith this action, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  and  the  French Government  alsostopped temporarily  all shipments to Scandinavia  and  Holland from  the BritishEmpire and Prance, except in the case of commodities in return for which definiteservice was rendered to the Allies.  In connection with the  question of  the generalembargoes  imposed  by  the  Associated Governments,  some  remarks  by Americanwriters are not without interest.   In his &quot; Blockade and Sea Power&quot; (published1924),  Maurice Parmelee, who  was one of the representatives of the United StatesWar Trade Board in London and chairman of the Allied Rationing and StatisticalCommittee, makes the following observations :         &quot;According to these Governments, the general embargo involved merely the    utilisation  of the  sovereign powers of the belligerent States concerned in    prohibiting  the exportation of commodities  from their own countries to the    embargoed country.  It was not  attempted to enforce general embargoes upon    neutral countries exporting to the embargoed country, ^hus it wTas alleged that    the general embargo cannot be regarded as arising directly out of the blockade,    though it was used to  coerce neutral countries  to follow a policy  which would    aid in making the blockade more effective.
         &quot; Whether  or  not the Allied and Associated  Governments were  legally    justified in  imposing general embargoes upon particular neutral countries, it    would be difficult to determine in the present inchoate state of international law.    But that they were distinctly unfriendly and discriminatory acts against the    friendly nations is evident, and as such cannot be too strongly condemned.  As    has  already been  indicated,  their ultimate purpose  was to  strengthen the    blockade, and they were enforced by  the blockading fleets, so  that they may    properly be assimilated with the other blockade measures&quot; (pp.  46-48).    In  a passage referring  to the United States embargo on  the shipment of commodities to  neutrals,  except on  condition  of  obtaining  a licence from thePresident, Fenwick,  in  his &quot;International Law&quot; (published in 1924), writes:          &quot; This system was the subject of many complaints from the neutral States,    which contested the statistics upon which the rationing  was carried  out.   With    the United States a belligerent, however, the protest of neutrals was of no avail,    and the war closed  with the doctrine of &apos; ultimate destination&apos; in its most rigid    form &quot;  (p. 542).    8.  Following on the imposition of general embargoes by the Associated Govern-ments, protracted negotiations ensued  with the northern neutrals for the conclusionof agreements.  As  regards  the  negotiations with the United States Governmentthe neutral  States were anxious as regards the  maintenance of an attitude of strictneutrality and contended that if they agreed to the stoppage  of all exports from theirrespective countries  to  the enemy they would, in effect, be departing from thatneutrality.  The United States  Government, on their part, had  to consider thepossible serious consequences to the Allies of the exercise of excessive  pressure on the neutrals.  They  were also careful to obtain assurances of the joint responsibility ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.  It was only during 1918 that  the United States war trade Board and the Allied Governments were able to conclude agreements with the scandinavian countries  and Holland.   Generally speaking, it may be stated that thesubstance of the agreements  was  to  provide for  the stoppage of  exports  of all important commodities to the enemy and for the allocation to the Allies of a share of neutral tonnage in return  for the allocation to neutrals of  a share of the world&apos;ssupplies.    9.  One of  the features of the rationing system was the creation in northernneutral countries of special consignees or consignment corporations.   This was madeone of the subjects of complaint by  the United States Government when neutral, asit was contended that the intricacy of the  arrangements hampered American com-mercial interests and reduced bond fide  trade with neutral  countries.  After theirentry into the war, however, the United  States  Government eventually came to identify themselves with the system of control exercised by consignment to appropriateassociations in Scandinavian  countries and Holland.    10.  The policy of  the black-list furnishes another illustration of inconsistencyon the part of the United States Government. In their protests of the 26th january and the 26th July, 1916, the  United States Government considered it their duty to protest in the most decided terms against the action of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin including certain  firms in  the United States  in the statutory list compiled and issued in accordance with  &quot; The Trading with  the Enemy  (Extension of Powers)Act, 1915.&quot;  The institution of this prescriptive &quot;black-list&quot;  was designated as having harsh and even disastrous effects upon the trade of the United States and asembodying a policy  of  arbitrary  interference with neutral trade.   Nevertheless,after  their entry into the war,  the United States  Government took measures to identify their black-list policy with that of  the Allies.  In a memorandum enclosedin a despatch, dated the  25th  July,  1917, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington, it was stated :          &quot;The War  Trade Intelligence Department is taking  a line in regard to    enemy firms in South America, and such firms as Messrs.  Amsinck in the United    States which far exceeds anything that we could have expected, and is at almost    complete  variance  with  the  professed anti-black-list  policy  of  the  State    Department.&quot;    Further, an arrangement was ultimately arrived at for assimilating the UnitedStates enemy trading list with the statutory lists published by Great Britain and the      [18320]                                                        B 2
 other Allies.  As, however, the United States procedure did not cover listing merely on grounds of enemy nationality, it became necessary to have evidence produced of enemy trade, propaganda, or other activity, in order to enable the correlation of the lists to be carried out.  Once  the  principle of the assimilation of the published statutory lists was achieved, the United  States War Trade Board suggested the assimilation of the respective confidential black-lists of the Associated Governments, and arrangements were also made  to this end.  The policy of the United States Government in this respect aroused, as  was almost inevitable,  considerable resent- ment in neutral South  American States.     11.   In the matter of censorship, the United States proved anxious to co-operate from the moment of their entry  into the  war,  and came to recognise more and  more the importance of this factor.                                               ..     12.   Representatives of the British cable censorship were  sent to Washington to help the United States Government in their organisation, and the system adopted came eventually  to be practically identical with that employed in London.   An interchange of information between  the two censorships was carried out and copies of telegrams stopped by either censorship were supplied to the other.  Co-operation was also maintained in the delicate matter of trade censorship, against which the United States had made so many protests before the war.     13.   The United   States postal censorship appears  to have  been faulty  in organisation, although  every effort was made by the British liaison officer to give the United States authorities  the  benefit  of the  experience gained by the British censorship.   In a passage in the &quot;Report on Postal Censorship during the Great War,&quot; it is stated, with reference to the United States postal censorship:-   &apos;         &quot; The methods of censorship were drastic in the extreme in regard  to letters     of black-listed correspondents;  the censors  could not be persuaded that it was     necessary to carry out periodical revision of suspended mail.  When  the. time     came for revision,  it was found that this class of detained  mail  was but of all     proportion to that  detained in France and England on similar grounds, and the     American censorship staff were placed on the horns of the dilemma as to whether     they would release  all or nothing.&quot;     14.  The United States customs authorities also had the sole right of search of vessels entering American ports, and the United States Customs Censorship Bureau claimed the right of examination of all  classes of correspondence found on board vessels entering New York, apart from ordinary  mails, and also correspondence written on board or addressed to vessels.  The bureau, therefore, handled  shipping documents,  consignees&apos; mail,   shipping companies&apos;,  correspondence,  passengers&apos; papers, passengers&apos; and crews&apos;  mail and correspondence found  on board vessels by the searcn officers.     15.  It has already been mentioned that no  proceedings  were taken m the United States prize courts.   In  the case  of goods shipped from  or to United States territory, proceedings would presumably  be held under United States Customs laws, and the only cases liable to prize proceedings were those where goods came within United  States jurisdiction for  the purpose of examination.  The question  of the possibility cf obtaining  the consent of the United States Government to undertake prize proceedings in the latter cases was  considered by the Foreign Office in September 1918 in view of the political advantage of the United  States Government becoming more closely identified with blockade measures, but after discussion  with the Admiralty the matter was allowed to drop.     16.  In  considering the extent of  United  States co-operation in exercising pressure upon neutrals, it  must  be remembered also that  the entry of the United States  into the war brought about a marked change in the nature of the blockade. The naval pressure exerted on sea by  the interception,  seizure  or detention of commodities afloat became largely superfluous as a result of the institution of the combined embargoes of  the United States and Great Britain,  by the dependence of neutrals on Allied bunkers and  by the conclusion of  agreements with the northernneutrals, the result being that the great majority of ships came to call voluntarily atAllied ports.  On the 30th January, 1918, indeed, it became possible for the Tenth Cruiser Squadron to be withdrawn  altogether,  and, as stated  in the Naval  Staffmonograph,  &quot;The  Economic   Blockade,  1914-19,&quot;  by  Lieutenant-CommanderW. E.  Arnold-Forster,  R.N.V.R., &quot;The final cutting  edge of the  blockade  was applied by customs officers working  on the quays at Liverpool,  Newcastle, Boston,New York.&quot;                     &quot;                              -
    17.  The question of the extent  to  which  the United States  Governmentacquiesced in the blockade measures is  a complicated one.  It would be difficult topoint to measures taken by the United States Government as a  belligerent against which they had previously protested as being contrary to the principles of inter-national  law.  Their  policy,  however,  was one  of general co-operation  with theAllies, whilst their representation on the Allied blockade organisations may be saidto have implied a tacit acquiescence in Allied blockade policy.   In certain importantfeatures of the blockade, such as the rationing principle and  the black-list  policy,there was  active  participation  by the United States  Government.   It may  be reasonable to contend,  therefore, that  the United States  Government have so farcommitted themselves that they could not now, in equity, take action against one ofthe Allies,  based on the alleged illegality of measures against neutrals for carryingout the blockade of the Central Powers.

(12933)[A 5775/1490/45]                   No.  1.                  limited States Participation in the Blockade.(Summary of replies received to enquiries on this subject addressed to the Admiralty,    the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence,  the Procurator-    General and Sir E. Howard.) Admiralty.     The Admiralty doubt whether the United States naval forces participated in the blockade so far as action by individual United States ships of war vis-a-vis individual merchant ships is concerned.  No evidence of such action has been discovered.     As  regards instructions to the United States naval forces, the Admiralty have transmitted a copy of the orders issued by the United States  Navy Department in June 1917.  There is nothing in these regulations which authorises  the  captain of a United States warship to visit a merchant ship and &quot; detain &quot; i.e., send her into port for further search to be made there.  Under the regulations, if  the ship&apos;s papers furnish a probable cause for capture, the vessel shall be seized in prize, and not merely detained with  a view to further enquiries being made in port.   The  doctrine of continuous voyage is applied to all classes of contraband.     The Admiralty transmit a copy  of a confidential monthly order issued to United States ships as well as to His Majesty&apos;s ships.  This order contained a copy of the order in council of March 1915  and instructions for putting that  order into effect. The Admiralty do not, however, consider it possible to state with certainty whether the United States ships would have carried out the instructions contained in this order or whether they would have acted in accordance with the above-quoted instructions of the United States Navy Department.     The Admiralty letter continues :          &apos;&apos; It may be pertinent to mention that the United States proposed,  originated     and carried out, in co-operation with us, a much more drastic operation against     the passage of neutral goods, say, from Spain and the Argentine to Germany and     Scandinavia, than anything we  attempted  before they came into the war-viz.,    the laying of the greater part of the northern mine barrage right across the North     Sea which  meant that  any vessels attempting to reach  the  Scandinavian    countries would be blown up without the chance of visit, search  or detention.&quot;    It may here be stated that the United States naval instructions referred to by theAdmiralty are, in so far as visit and search of contraband are concerned, based onThe Hague Conventions of 1907.  There  is a strict definition of the articles whichmay be considered as contraband, limited in the main to war material, but includingalso fuel, food-stuffs, clothing, &amp;c, &quot;actually destined for the use  of  the enemyGovernment or  its armed forces.&quot;  It would  almost certainly be maintained by theUnited States Government that it is these instructions  which were binding on theUnited States navy  during the late  war and that the copy of  the  British monthlyorder relating to the execution of the British order in council of March 1915 was distributed to the United  States fleet for  their  information only.Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    The memorandum submitted by this section shows that at the time the UnitedStates entered the war the British Admiralty were mainly concerned with the successof the German submarines and with securing American help against these urgentdangers. There was at the time no thought of seeking American help for the blockadesquadron.  Very few ships had tried to run the blockade during 1916 and none at allsince  the -autumn of  that year.    The question  of  tightening the naval blockadedid not therefore  arise.   In the  course  of  an Admiralty letter to the  British      3356   [18321]
* November 18, Section 1.Commander-in-chief, dated the 6th April, 1917, in regard to the naval assistance tobe anticipated from the United States,  the following passage occurs:           The  blockade will be rendered more effective by the  surveillance  over    neutral vessels in United  States ports which, it is hoped, the United States    Government will shortly organise.   The United States  will also be invited to    co-operate in the Allied measures for the restriction of enemy supplies, such as    black list, bunkering,&quot; &amp;c.    The Admiralty clearly hoped  that the Americans, by taking over the patrol ofthe outer routes, would release cruisers and armed merchant cruisers, which could then be used for convoying and protecting trade.  None of the naval reinforcementssent over by the United States during the war took any share in the naval blockade,which  practically  ceased in  the autumn of the year 1917,  when  the 10th  cruiser squadron was withdrawn.    There can  thus, the memorandum continues, be hb - doubt that  the AmericanGovernment could clear itself of  the specific  charge of enforcing with Americanmen-of-war British orders in council and British contraband lists; but it is  an openquestion whether they could answer the more general charge of assisting in the navalblockade of Germany.    After examining  the situation  created  by the  blockade, the Committee  ofImperial  Defence memorandum points  out that  the naval,  control exercised  overneutral commerce was on such a scale that it could not possibly be attributed  solely tothe iOth Cruiser Squadron;  it was a general surveillance which every squadron, onthe high seas helped to make effective.  If this is granted, it obviously follows thatthe American forces in the North  Sea and  the Atlantic were at least partly respon-sible for the naval blockade  of Germany.   The withdrawal of the 10th Squadronwas,  indeed, not so  much  the end of the  naval  blockade as the transfer  of responsibilities from a particular squadron to the Allied navies.Procurator-General&apos;s Offices.    So far as the actual work of the Procurator-General is Concerned, the interven-tion of the United States of America made no difference at all.  There was no sort ofco-operation with any American department.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington.    In a private letter to me, dated the 20th November, Sir E. Howard, after statingthat the instructions had been given to make full enquiry into the question of UnitedStates naval participation in the  blockade, continues as follows :          &quot; I feel that, even though the United States navy may never have taken any    action of this kind or received definite instructions to take such action, this does    not affect the position that the United States Government entirely approved and,    indeed, urged us on to  redouble the rigours of the blockade after they joined.    They are, therefore, morally responsible for all that was done after they joined    in the war, and cannot  either in logic or  fairness bring claims against us for    having taken measures before  they came into the war which they fully approved    of after they entered it.. This was one of  the arguments I -used in speaking to    the President and Mr. Kellogg on the morning of the 7th, and neither  of them     attempted  to  refute it;    As far as this  is concerned,  therefore, I feel that,    whether or no United States naval units  took  any measure of this kind,  our     position in this respect is a strong one.&quot;    The Embassy&apos;s enquiries are  continuing, but I think it very unlikely that theywill be able to add anything of consequence to the information supplied in this paper and in the Librarv memorandum of  the  18th November.*                                                           R.

                    BELLIGERENT  RIGHTS  AT  SEA,                 MEMORANDUM PREPARED  IN  THE  ADMIRALTY.    The present is not an  opportune time to approach the  U.S.A.; indeed, the ^im^*temper of the Press of that  country might render such an attempt disastrous, forPeonrer-owing to the idea of the Freedom  of the Seas promulgated by Colonel House 9ations-having been twisted by the Big Navy Party for propaganda purposes.    2.  Before any steps towards negotiations are taken, it  is necessary to decide Britishwhether our policy should be one which benefits us as                           po 107&apos;         [a.)  A belligerent, or         (&amp;.)  A neutral, or         (c.)  A country acting for the League of Nations.    (a) and (e) will probably be similar in effect.    In the memorandum by the International Law Committee of December, 1918(Paper No. B.R. 7), it is stated that &quot;the  paramount interest  was the interest  ofthis country as a belligerent, rather than as a neutral.&quot;  In the view of the Admiraltythat statement is still correct.   It is vital to be able to defeat our enemy in war,whilst any interference with our commerce when we are neutral is an inconvenienceonly.    3.  Therefore, our policy should be governed by our needs as a belligerent.    According to our war experience, the successful issue of any great war of thefuture will depend upon the exercise of our full belligerent rights at sea.    The relaxation of the full exercise of our powers could only be considered  inlesser wars where it might prove expedient  to refrain from  exercising them to thefull.                       &apos;    4.  Further, unless we  possess and exercise belligerent rights at sea, it is not Support of possible to act, when the Cabinet so decide, in support of the  Covenant of the Nations.0League of Nations, or to carry out our obligations under the Locarno Treaty.    5.  We claim the following belligerent  rights, by  the  use of which  the great Belligerentwar was won :                                                                dlfmed.                                                      United States Views.  (a.) The right of visit and search.                 Agree.  (b.) The right of  detention: i.e.,  if  for  any    Disagree.sufficient reason it is not practicable to  visitor    Search  must  take  place onto conduct a satisfactory search,  vessels may be  the spot.detained and sent into port in order  that further investigation may be made.  It is contemplated that  vessels would only bedeflected to convenient ports.  (c.) The right of seizure in prize.                  Agree.  (d.) The right to blockade, with the object of    Agree,  but  this  subject  re-striking at the enemy&apos;s. commerce and weakening  quires further consideration  ashis resources ; the blockading ships may  be at  given in  Appendix I.some distance from the blockaded port or coast.  (e.) The right to prevent a neutral from carrying    Agree.  But the United states to an enemy articles calculated to aid him in the  would  probably wish  the listsconduct of the war, i.e.,  Law of  Contraband,  of  contraband to  be  strictlyThe contraband list may vary with the particular  limited.war and be flexible.  (/.) The right to prevent  unneutral service.        Agree,  (g.) The application of the  doctrine of  &quot; con-    Agree  as to (g) (i), not as  totinuous  voyage&quot;  or &quot; transportation &quot;  both  to  (g) (ii).(i) contraband and (ii) blockade.       [17087]                                                       B 2
  (h.) The right to rely on other evidence than is available in the ship&apos;s papers, by interrogatoriesof the personnel, and actual search on the spot ofthe ship.                         .  (i.) The  right to examine ships under  convoy of neutral warships.  (/.) The  right  to  censor mails  in  merchant ships and to seize seditious literature.  (k.)  The  right  to  arm  defensively  british merchant ships. , (Z.) The  right to retaliate against a belligerentwho breaks international law, treaty obligationsor the customary usages of  naval warfare.   United States Views.Disagree.      .....  Now disagree.  Disagree   generally.   have probably  not considered sedi-tious literature.  Agree generally.  Disagree, in all  probability,on  principle in large sense inwhich Great Britain has appliedRetaliation.;              The Declaration of Paris and The Hague Conventions to which we are a party         will bind  us when belligerent, if  the other belligerents  are  also  parties.  The         Declaration  of  London will,  of  course,  not be  binding.  Customary  usages in         naval  warfare, e.g., the securing  of  the safety of the lives of  neutrals  and non-         combatants, will be observed.              In addition to exercising the  above rights, it may be necessary to enter into         arrangements with guilds or organisations in neutral countries as  to  inspecting&quot;         and guaranteeing  goods  which are for use and  consumption  only in  their  own         countries,  to consider the  possibilities of  rationing the domestic  requirements         of some neutrals, to exercise bunker control and establish &quot; Black Lists&quot; and to         introduce the Navicert System.              Note. The Legal Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee on Trading and         Blockade in Time of War considered in their Report (Paper No. B.R. 6) that the         Prize Courts will uphold (a), (6), (c), (e) and (h), which have been italicised above.         The Committee did not deal with (/), (g), (i), (k)  and (Z), but it is felt  that they         would  have believed  that  the Prize  Courts would uphold these rights, with         possibly the exception of the application of the doctrine of &quot; continuous voyage &quot;         or  &quot; transportation &quot;  to  blockade.   The doctrine of &quot; continuous  voyage &quot;  (the         term in this connection covering also &quot; continuous transportation &quot;) was definitely         adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Maritime Rights Order in  Council of    7    the  7th July, 1916, presumably as a permanent policy, and not for the war only.              As regards (j), the Legal Sub-Committee has  since supported the right to         seize seditious literature and  reported  on the question  of censoring Mails (vide         Appendix III to C.I.D. Paper  No. 852-B).              As regards (d) and (g) (ii), i.e., blockade and &quot; continuous transportation,&quot; this         is dealt with in Appendix I.ns.A.          6.   The U.S.A. when at war, or in their instructions for  the United  Statesregarding   Navy  governing Maritime  Warfare, have at one time  or  another claimed  andawe      exercised the above rights (with the support of  their Courts), with the  exceptionr,ghts&apos;     of  (j) and (Z).*   Instances  occurred in the American Civil War  approximating to         the modern  practice of detention, and of (g), i.e., &quot;continuous voyage,&quot; as  regards         both contraband and blockade, and of (h).  U.S.A. Naval  Forces have, however, not         been called upon to exercise belligerent naval rights in an important war since the         American Civil War.  During their wars  they  have shown themselves  always         inclined to press belligerent rights :  in  1812  they  were ruthless in sinking enemy         prizes; in  the Civil War -two years  after  the  American  Government  had         questioned the legality  of commercial  blockades  they carried out against the         South  the biggest commercial blockade that there had ever been, and pressed their         rights to the full  with the  comparatively small  blockading  squadrons  that they          employed.   During the Civil War they extended, by their adoption of the doctrine          of  &quot; continuous voyage &quot; the then existing international practice.   * The Northern Barrage may, however, be regarded as a reprisal l.y the  U.S&apos;.A. against the lawless actsby German Submarines.          &quot;
    Their Prize Manual contemplates additions to their Contraband Lists in war.The tendency of the U.S.A. in peace  is to  seek to limit  the rights of belligerents,but when at war they exercise full rights.   They refused to  abolish privateeringwhen other nations did, entirely because they thought abolition would be to theirdisadvantage.  The practical result is that their attitude may be said to be &quot; HeadsI win, tails you lose.&quot;  It must be  recognised, however, that  in  the U.S.A., as elsewhere, there are always divergent currents of opinion.            .    However, &quot; The United States Instructions for the Navy governing MaritimeWarfare,&quot; June 1917,  do not  authorise  the  following  (which presumably  aretherefore forbidden if the correspondence during the Great War is a criterion):     (&amp;.) The  right of detention.    (g.) (ii.)  The application  of  the  doctrine of &quot; continuous voyage &quot; or &quot; trans-          portation &quot; to blockade (though  it is fully applied to all contraband;.    (h.) The right to rely on extrinsic evidence.    (i.)  The  right to examine ships under convoy of neutral warships (Article 42),          though there is in Article  64 a clause that a neutral private vessel is in          general liable  to  capture if she  is under  neutral  convoy to  avoid          rightful capture.  (This is difficult to understand.)    (j.) The  right to censor mails (Article 87 of the  Instructions states that the          genuine postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents is inviolable).          It should be noted, however, that  Article  24 includes in the American          list  of Contraband &quot; currency,&quot;  &quot; evidences of debt,&quot; and in the corres-          pondence during the war the United States Department  of State were          inclined to agree that mail matter which included stocks, bonds, coupons          and similar securities, might be regarded as of the nature of merchandise :          thus by  implication  admitting the right of  censorship in order to          enable  a  belligerent  to ascertain  the contents of letters  that  might          contain matter thought to be justly capable of seizure, because of  enemy          destination.   If the right of examining the mails of neutral vessels on          the  High Seas is admitted, the principle of inviolability ceases to apply.    (I.)  The right of retaliation.               It  may  be advisable  to  remark that though certain rights  appear          in the  United  States Instructions, it  does not  follow that the U.S.          Government would favour their retention; it is very conceivable that          the  U.S.  Government or  Senate would press for the abolition of  the          doctrine of &quot; continuous voyage &quot; as applied to conditional contraband.    7.  What policy are the U.S.A. likely to adopt if they are approached on  the  Probable linequestion of  belligerent  rights,  their national policy having  been, when neutral,  conversationsthat  there should be  complete  immunity  of  private property  at  sea  except  are opened.contraband ?    There is presumably  no intention  of  our sacrificing the right of capture of enemy property (including merchant ships owned in whole or  in part by an enemy),and therefore,  if America makes the abolition of this right a sine qua non (asmay not unreasonably be anticipated), no agreement is either possible or desirable.    If,  however, while desiring the abolition of the right of capture of  enemy property at sea the U.S.A. entered into negotiations which accepted the continuanceof  this right as outside the terms  of  discussion, all  or some  of  the followingdemands would probably be made :      (a.)  The abolition  of a commercial blockade, i.e.,  a blockade  to  weaken  the           enemy by cutting off  his commerce.     (&amp;.)  The abandonment of the right  of  search and the substitution thereof of           a  neutral visa.      (     (c.)  If not the abolition of the principle of contraband, the adoption of a plan           embracing the abolition of conditional contraband and the drawing up           of a definite  list of  contraband  associated  with a scheme for  the           co-operation of neutrals and belligerents in certification of the contents           of cargoes, so that the risk of capture may  be  borne by  those who           voluntarily assume it.     8.  It is improbable that the U.S.A. would make  an agreement  with us upon  Agreement Belligerent Rights unless wholesale sacrifices on our part were made.              TLEUL.6
    Moreover, not only would agreement have to be. reached with  the Executive,but ratification by the Senate would have to be secured, and in  view of the doublecurrent of  opinion in the States and  the-present excitable state of that Country,ratification is unlikely. &apos;         -                   : . 1     1    As stated below, it would be necessary on our part to consult the Dominionsbefore coming to an  agreement, and the danger must be recognised of  discoveringtwo currents of  opinion amongst them....    A breakdown of such a Conference, due to any of the  causes suggested, wouldbe productive of harm.    If, contrary to  expectation, the  difficulties  anticipated did not prove insur-mountable, the  following further objections  to  an agreement  would  have  to beconsidered: -    (a.) Agreements made in peace never  completely foresee the needs of a future           war, and  at the time of peril they hamper us in action.    (b.) The same is true of our adversaries, and in their  case we can have no           assurance that a paper  agreement will not be cast aside on  one pretext           or another when  the time comes.    (c.) The alleged advantage of immunity of our supplies  from capture is a           fallacy unless  enemy  property  at  sea is exempted.  Such exemption           would cripple us  in a war with any naval Power other than the U.S.A.    (d.) Our bargaining  power would be  much reduced,  vis-a-vis  a  continental           Power.              &quot; It is noticeable that Powers  with large armies have endeavoured           to limit the effect and  force of sea power of which, with good cause,           they stood in awe &quot;  (Memorandum by International Law Committee of           December 1918-Paper  No. B.R. 7).    (e.) If we surrender any of the principles of sea power in peace in fear of           offending  in war a strong neutral Power, we at the same time forgo a           valuable asset in  a war  in which there is little or no chance of offending           that Power.Reflection onour previousattempts toplease TJ.S.A.PeaceAgreementsdo notweather AVnrStorms.TheDominionsmust be consulted.    9.  The result of previous agreements with the U.S.A. does not encourage theidea that further concessions will bring us better treatment  at  their hands than we enjoy at the  present time, in  respect, for instance, to the  Japanese Treaty,Washington Agreement (elevation of guns), and American  debt.   Each concessionwas to have secured American friendship for us, but appears to have created anatmosohere more unfavourable than before to this country.         Agreements regarding belligerent maritime rights made  in  peace haveinvariably failed to stand the test of war, as, for instance, The Hague Agreements,several  of which had to be evaded, and the Declaration of London  which wascancelled by us under the pressure of war conditions.    11.   The  Dominions  are  vitally  interested  in everything that  affects theBritish  Navy  and  anything that limits  its effectiveness.  Their  position  is  as stated by Sir  Littleton  Groom (Australia;  at  the British Empire  DelegationMeeting at Geneva in  September 1924, when he said, &quot; It was impossible for theBritish  Government to make any decision concerning the fleet without involving the whole Empire.&quot;  Great Britain, moreover, cannot make an agreement  withany Power affecting belligerent rights from which the Dominions could stand out,for it is unthinkable that  one part, of  the Empire  should carry out warfareaccording to one set of rules and another part according to a different set of  rules.The Empire as  a whole  must apply  British  Prize  Law.   The  New Zealand division of the Royal Navy will automatically operate with the Royal Navy in theevent of war, and it is to be anticipated  that  Australia will  place  all or some ofher ships at the disposal of the Admiralty in war.    The interest of the Dominions in  belligerent rights at sea was shown at theImperial  Conference in  1911,  when  the Commonwealth of Australia tabled aresolution which   stated  that &quot; It is regretted that the  Dominions were notconsulted prior to  the acceptance  by  the  British Delegation of the terms of theDeclaration of London.&quot;  The absolute need of consulting the Dominions hasbeen  strengthened by the  Resolutions  of  the  Imperial  Conference  of   1923regarding the procedure to be observed in the negotiation, signature and ratifica-tion of  International agreements and  in their  defence  resolutions, reaffirmed  in;
1926, which laid down, as a guiding principle, the desirability of the maintenanceof a minimum  standing  of  naval strength, namely, equality with  the naval strength of any foreign Power.    Since a possibility exists  that there may be a divergence of opinion betweenthe Dominions on the advantages or disadvantages of coming to some  agreementwith the U.S.A., which  might involve a limitation of the belligerent rights of theRoyal Navy, the idea of an agreement needs, if  only for this reason, the most careful consideration, as  it would be a  misfortune to occasion a cleavage of opinion between the various parts of the British Empire.    12.   The Admiralty do not believe that there is at present any likelihood of Objectionsthe American Government and  Senate agreeing to detention,  rationing,  seizure agreement and  censorship  of  mails, retaliation,  or  that any agreement would be possibleabout contraband or blockade, or  the use of evidence not found on  board  theintercepted ship.  The Admiralty believe that the U.S.A. Government and  Senate(if approached) will  press the &quot; Neutral&quot; view and that there is no firm basis foran agreement.  Discussions will  mean that we get on to a slippery slope and thatto secure American concurrence in  one right  we have  to  sacrifice  somethingconsiderable.  The possibilities of agreement  are hypothetical in the extreme  andthe dangers of starting  negotiations considerable;  they are a leap in the dark; an unsatisfactory result is the probable outcome.    13. (a.) Our policy should be governed by our.needs as a belligerent.          Admiralty0    (&amp;.) According to our war experience the successful issue of any great war of yiews onthe future will depend upon the exercise of our full belligerent rights at  sea.       subject.    The exercise of our powers  to a  limited extent could only be considered inlesser wars  where it might prove expedient to  refrain from  exercising them tothe full.    (c.) It  will  be  definitely to our  disadvantage to  consider limitation of  ourbelligerent rights while we possess superiority on the seas.    (d.) It  cannot be foretold when,  if ever, the  U.S.A. will be superior to  us;their present policy is to frighten us into surrendering our  strong sea position fora weaker one by a good bluff on a possibly stronger Navy in the future.    (e.) We have no indication  as  to the limitations which the U.S.A. would propose, and a breakdown of negotiations would do much harm.    (/.) Any agreement reached could not be guaranteed  to stand the test of&quot; Military necessity &quot; and consequently we dare  not reduce our Navy below that required to ensure our seaborne supplies in time  of war.  No peace-time economy,therefore, could be involved.    (g.) An agreement with the U.S.A. alone wTould proclaim us to the world asafraid of her;  any agreement  must  be  international.  The probability  of  theU.S.A. entering a war, in which  we might be  engaged, against us on  account ofour treatment of her as  a neutral, has been much  overrated.  To provide against such an  unlikely contingency we cannot afford  to forgo our rights at sea as  abelligerent vis-a-vis other sea Powers.    \h.) It  is generally assumed that war with the U.S.A. is &quot; unthinkable &quot; ;  butit is claimed that if,  when we  are at war  with another Power, we interfere withthe commerce of the U.S.A., then war with them will be probable.  It  is obvious,therefore, that the best way to keep clear of trouble with the TJ.S.A. is not to goto war with another  Power.    The likelihood of war with another Power depends  largely on how much other powers  fear to go  to  war with us.  If we  give up  belligerent rights  at  sea,neither  Japan nor any Continental Powers will be nearly so afraid of  us as theyare at the present time.    By maintaining our  claim to full belligerent rights  we     (i.)  Reduce our chances of war with either Japan or a Continental Power;   (ii.)  Minimise as far as,possible the chances of trouble with the U.S.A.    (i.)  This is not an opportune time, in any case, to approach the U.S.A.; the ideaof the Freedom of the Seas, promulgated by Colonel House, has been  twisted bythe Big Navy Press in the U.S.A. for propaganda purposes, and the temper of  thepress is such that any attempt  at present to discuss belligerent rights would be disastrous.Admiralty, S.W. 1,      January 14, 1928.

SEVERAL formal  blockades  were  declared  during the Great  War invarious parts of the world, e.g., East Coast of  Africa, Asia Minor, Greece, Salonikaand Tsingtao, and it is impossible to give up the formal type  of blockade as under-stood at the time of the Declaration of Paris and as applied by the U.SA.  in theCivil  War.    2.  The view of Great Britain and, it is understood, of the U.S.A. in the past hasbeen that the area of operations of the blockading forces does not need to be limited tothe close neighbourhood of the blockaded port or coast, and that the true criterionof the legality of a blockade is not the place where the blockading ships are situated,but the capability of the forces wherever stationed to maintain the blockade.   Evenin Nelson&apos;s time his blockade of Toulon when he stationed his ships 100 miles off theport  was recognised as  valid.  Distances such as 100 miles and 800  miles were suggested in conversations at the Hague Conference in 1907, and in connection withthe Declaration of London the United States  representatives  suggested 1,000 milesas the maximum.  Primd facie,  there is thus  a considerable measure of agreementbetween the U.S.A. and this  country that a long distance blockade may be carriedout, and during the war the  United States Secretary of State, on the 30th March,1915,  stated that &quot; the Government  of the United States might be ready to  admit that the old form of close blockade with its cordon of ships in the immediate offingof the blockading  ports is no longer practicable &quot; (copy of  telegram attached as annex 1).  It will be seen, in  so far as this telegram is of value, that America would allow the blockading, squadrons to be practically placed at any distance, but the squadron would let through  all outward traffic from  a neutral country and  allinward traffic  fo a  neutral,  except  contraband;  the blockading squadron  would apparently have full rights  against vessels going direct to  and from  the enemyblockaded coast and have only the right of interception of contraband in the. case ofvessels going to neutral contiguous territory.  This proposition does not allow theidea of &quot; continuous voyage &quot; or &quot; transportation  &quot; in connection with long  distanceblockade; the United States of America also probably intended, and, in  the opinionof the Admiralty, would now demand, that visit and search should be carried out onthe spot in  the case of vessels going to neutral  contiguous territory.    3.  In the opinion  of  the Admiralty,  both the  doctrines of &quot;continuousvoyage &quot; (vessel) and of &quot;continuous transportation &quot;  (goods on  board) should beapplied to  blockade in cases where it has been considered essential to adopt a long distance blockade, where the  blockading ships lie across the lines of approach to neutral as well as enemy territory.  The British Courts  in Lord StowelFs time held that  &quot; continuous  sea  voyage &quot;  but not &quot; contimious transportation &quot;  (includingboth  land and sea) to or from a  port under blockade would  be  the  ground ofcondemnation and confiscation.  If a long distance blockade was formally declaredin the future it is presumably a matter of some doubt whether the Prize Courtswould now accept  either the  doctrine of &quot; continuous sea voyage &quot; or &quot; continuoustransportation.&quot; It is anticipated that they would probably  adopt the doctrine of&quot;continuous  voyage &quot;  and possibly  the doctrine of &quot;continuous transportation.&quot;In  this connection there are  portions in the judgment of Sir  Samuel Evans in thecase of &quot; The Leonora &quot; which are attached in  Annex 2 for convenience of reference.It seems wrong to make the character of the voyage rather than the destination ofthe goods  the test.  Whilst  this  blockade  might be conducted  by  ships mainlyoperating at a distance, it may be, in fact, anticipated that belligerents may employ a number of submarines near the blockaded coast to add  to the effectiveness of theblockade by turning back vessels that have  passed  the outlying ships.  Such a blockade does not deny access  to neutral ports, except in so far as the goods are forthe purposes  of the enemy.                                              ,   .....
     5.  A blockade is very necessary to prevent the enemy sending exports  from the  country  and thus increasing the enemy&apos;s  financial  resources.   It  cuts off  all commerce, whereas, under the Law of Contraband, no outward commerce in neutral ships can be  intercepted.     6.  As regards the U.S.A., it is felt that either the Executive or the Senate (or both) would resolutely oppose the doctrine of &quot; continuous voyage &quot; or &quot;  transporta- tion &quot; in  reference to  Blockade.  American protests during  the war are considered to represent American views rather than one or two of their Prize  Court decisions during the Civil War.  It is also gravely doubted whether, if now approached, the U.S A. authorities would not endeavour to restrict the distance at which blockading ships may be stationed.     7.  As regards Article 16 of the Covenant and the application of the words therein &quot; Prevention  of all financial, commercial  or  personal intercourse between the nationals and the Covenant-breaking  State  and the nationals of any  other State, whether a  Member of the  League or not &quot; the view of the Admiralty hasbeen stated in Admiralty letter M. 02587 of the 24th September, 1927  (Annex 3). This coincides  with the view of the Legal Sub-Committee, namely, that the first paragraph of  Article 16  appears  to  contemplate  measures taken within the jurisdiction of individual States.   If the policy contained in the above-quotedAdmiralty letter  is carried  out, there should be less occasion for possible frictionwith the USA.Admiralty, S.W. 1,    January 14, 1928.                                   ANNEX 1.   Extract from Telegram from Mr. Bryan,  United States Secretary of State,           Washington, to Ambassador Page, London, March 30, 1915.    The Government of United States is, of  course, not oblivious to  the  greatchanges which have occurred in the conditions and means of naval warfare sincethe rules hitherto governing legal blockade were formulated.   It might be  readyto admit that the old form  of  &quot; close&quot;  blockade, with its cordon of ships in theimmediate offing of the blockaded ports, is no longer practicable in face of an enemypossessing the means and opportunity to make an effective defence by  the use of submarines, mines and  aircraft; but it can hardly be maintained that, whateverform of effective blockade may be made use of,  it is impossible to conform  at least to the spirit and principles of the established rules of war.    If the necessities of the case should seem to  render it imperative that  thecordon of blockading vessels be extended across the approaches to any neighbouringport or country, it would seem clear that it would still be easily practicable to complywith the well-recognised and reasonable  prohibition of  international law against theblockading of neutral ports by according  free admission and exit to all lawful trafficwith neutral ports through the blockading cordon.  This traffic would, of course,include all  outward-bound  traffic to the  neutral  country and  all  inward-boundtraffic to the neutral country,  except contraband in transit to the enemy.   Suchprocedure need not  conflict in any respect with the rights of the belligerent main-taining the blockade, since the  right would remain  with the blockading  vessels to visit and search all ships either entering  or leaving the neutral territory which theywere in fact, but not of  right, investing.[17087]
                                   ANNEX 2.         Statement by Sir Samuel Evans, President of the Prize Court.The &quot;-Leonora&quot;  (1918).    The law of blockade has the same fundamental principle as that of contrabandand carries it out to a still greater extent, because it involves the confiscability ofthe vessels  and of goods  of all  descriptions, by  whomsoever^ wned,  laden  onwhatsoever vessels, and whether proceeding to or from blockaded ports, if the vessels are captured in running, or attempting to run, the blockade.  The justification ofthese rules,  so serious to  neutrals, is the acknowledged right of belligerents to bring pressure on  the  enemy  by curtailing or stopping all trade in  all commoditieswhatsoever to or from ports of the enemy, apart altogether from any direct relation of the trade or goods to immediate war uses. In the region of blockade, changes inthe rules have also been established which have involved,  of necessity, substantial increases in the degree to which neutral commerce has suffered.  For a long time itwas deemed necessary to prove a strict blockade of particular ports by war  vessels which were stationary or remained in sufficiently close proximity to the ports.  but now what  is known  as commercial blockades are fully  recognised.  Upon thisquestion the Convention  called the Declaration  of Paris was not very definite.  The&quot; effectif &quot;  character of a blockade,  even  with the added definition, was left in a somewhat general form,  perhaps advisedly.         ******    It is, of course, true that, according to the existing rules of international law,there can be no blockade of neutral ports or coast lines.   The Order in  Council,of  16th  February,  1917, does not purport to  declare  a blockade of the  ports towhich it applies in the strict sense in which that term is used in international law.But the object at  which it is aimed as regards the enemy is similar.  In saying this,I am not suggesting  that  the method adopted by the Order  in  Council has beenaccepted by the nations in  such a way that it already forms part of the establishedlaw.  That some change will evolve upon this subject, in view of the kinds of weapons now used on and under the sea, and in the air, seems certain.  Meantime,can it be said that what the Order in Council prescribes is in any essential principledifferent from a blockade?   It is not on the lines of a blockade,  by whatever nameit may be called ?   It is not a blockade of enemy ports;  but it is a stoppage or quasi-blockade at the enemy&apos;s rriaritime trade through adjacent ports.                                  ANNEX 3.            Copy of a Letter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office.(M. 02587.)(Confidential and Immediate.)Sir,                                                       September 24, 1927.    I am commanded by My Lords  Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaintyou, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that Theyhave noticed in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 17th September, 1927, that M. Paul Boncourhas produced before the Third (Disarmament) Committee of the Assembly on  the16th September the accompanying Resolution^  My Lords desire to invite attentionto clauses (b) (d) and (e) of that Resolution, and to offer the following observations :- -    2.  Clause (b). By the reference to the provision of &quot; armaments,&quot; it is obviousthat the phrase that each Power &quot; can count on collective aid organised by the Leagueof Nations &quot; is intended, inter alia, to refer to Military assistance.     Clauses (d) and (e)  contemplate, inter alia, the defining of military obligations.     3.  My Lords consider that the British Representatives at Geneva should makeit clear that the  Covenant of the  League of Nations imposes no obligation on HisMajesty&apos;s Government  to take military action in any event  except with the con-currence of  their  representative  on the Council.   It will  be remembered that article 10 of  the Covenant has not been given a peremptory interpretation,  but                               *  Not reproduced here.
[17087]rather the opposite, when the matter was discussed by the Assembly in 1924.  Itwas also agreed by the Assembly in 1924 that any recommendations under Article 11have  no binding  force  and impose  no  obligation on  a State without  its ownconcurrence.   Also, under Article 16, each member of the League is free to decide for itself whether  it would or would not participate in military action, and, in anycase,  under  paragraph 2  of  Article  16 of  the Covenant,  the Council  only&quot; recommends.&quot;   If any belligerent Naval measures are taken, a declaration of warby this country will be necessary.    4.  My Lords are aware that the commitments under  Article 16 were stated by the Foreign Office in Secret paper OLD. No. 700-B, in the following form :          &quot; That  the intention of Article- 16 was undoubtedly to oblige members to    sever financial and  economic relations, and to take  in addition military and    naval action if the Council thought it expedient.&quot;         &quot; As regards such  naval and military  measures, the particular measures    recommended  are not an obligation on the State, but the fact that it is at liberty    to form  its own judgment  as to Naval and Military measures which it will    take when action is called for, does not entitle it to sit still and do nothing.    It is bound  to co-operate loyally and effectively in support of Covenant to such    extent as  is  compatible with  its  military  situation and its  geographical    position.&quot;In connection with that statement, and, whilst recognising that the recommendationof the Council must be unanimous and  could not be made without the concurrence of the British Member of the Council, who could only concur with Cabinet approval,My Lords  request that  the British  Representatives at Geneva will maintain theview  as in the past that the British Government  is  not prepared to consider inadvance  the  definition of military assistance which it would be disposed to giveunder Article 16;  and,  further, that they will maintain in particular that thiscountry (a) will not undertake to establish a blockade, and (b) will remain the judge of the type and the extent of the military measures it will take.    5.  My Lords would also emphasise  that Article 16 says nothing about a navalblockade,  and that, in  any  case, it is for the Naval  Staff to  decide whether thesituation permitted the enforcement of a naval blockade.    6.  In connection with this question of blockades, I am to invite attention tothe U.S.A.  attitude regarding  blockade questions  (see, for  example,  Sir EsmeHoward&apos;s  despatches numbered  1512 of the  3rd August,  1927, and  1549 of the12th  August, 1927).   It is quite important that there should  be no  commitment to carry out  a  blockade,  in order  that the issues  commonly  known  in U.S.A.as the  &quot;freedom  of  the  seas,&quot; should not be  unnecessarily  raised  with  thatcountry, and  any tendencies at  Geneva  to regard a  maritime blockade,  whetherpacific  or  otherwise, as one of the measures  to  be  taken under Article  16 orArticle 11 of the Covenant should  be  resisted.   In particular, as regards para-graph 1 of Article 16, it  should be maintained  that the measures of economic pressure indicated therein  do not include any naval  measures  at  sea,  whether ofthe nature of a pacific  blockade or otherwise.  This view can well be supportedby the contention  that the aim of the Covenant is  not to involve countries in war,and this country, if it carried out a pacific blockade, would be involved in disputes,possibly in war, with U.S.A. and nations not adhering to the Covenant.   the probability of trouble with America is too real to be risked.    My Lords request that the  British Representatives at  Geneva be informed ofthese views,  arid  that  the  present  opportunity at Geneva be taken for statingdefinitely the above understandings as to the existing situation under the Covenant,at the same time resisting M. Paul Boncour&apos;s suggested resolution and any formula to imply any military obligation. There is every reason to think that  these views are in accordance with the  views of the Dominions and of various members of theLeague.    Copies of this letter have been sent  to the Committee of Imperial Defence, WarOffice and Air Ministry.                                      I am,  Sir,                                          Your obedient Servant,                                        (Signed)      CHARLES WALKER.
IF CALLED UPON  AS  A BELLIGERENT TO  TAKE ACTION UNDER ARTICLE 16 OF  THE    COVENANT TO CARRY OUT A BLOCKADE AGAINST ANOTHER NATION,  COULD GREAT    BRITAIN CARRY IT OUT?                   Memorandum prepared in the  A dmiralty.    1.  THOSE  who contend that under Article 16 of the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations we are obligated, subject to the approval of the British Member  of theCouncil and the Cabinet, to  carry out a blockade usually appear to assume that theblockade will be applicable to the  blockaded  country as a whole  (they probably donot include that country&apos;s dependencies).  Naval blockades have,  in the past, eitherbeen applicable to ports, parts of the coast, or the whole coast.  Whether a blockadecould be carried out of the blockaded country as a whole is largely a geographicalproblem dependent not only on the length of the coast-line, but on such factors aswhether the coast-line faces two seas, whether  the blockaded country is an island, &amp;c.    2.  It is obvious that this country, even with  assistance, could not blockadeboth coasts of the U.S A., or all the territory of Japan proper at the beginning of awar, or France at the beginning of  a war, and that, therefore, it is a question for theAdmiralty at the, time to decide what Naval  operations are to be taken.  Generallyspeaking, however, a blockade is in many cases quite feasible, and that, too, withoutrelying on the doctrine of  &apos;&apos; continuous voyage &apos;&apos; in connection with blockade.  Forthe assumption in connection with a League war has to be that, even although thematerial went forward to a contiguous country to the Covenant-breaking State, thatcontiguous State would not  give clearance or railway  facilities, &amp;c.  The british navy  could intercept ships and  cargoes  going direct to the Covenant-breakingcountry under the ordinary rules of blockade, which, of course, entitle the Navy alsoto seize vessels whose ostensible destination may be a neutral country when it is foundthat their actual  destination is an  enemy country.     3.   The League should not regard the establishment of a blockade as in any wayautomatic.  It cannot be so, and it is dangerous to Naval  operations  that it shouldbe so.  When this country  is at  war with a Covenant-breaking State  the  Navaioperations should be such as are considered best fitted by the Admiralty to coerce theCovenant-breaking State.  It may be sufficient (in addition to the other Naval action taken) to blockade, one or  two ports or a, small stretch or stretches of  the coast.  Inthis connection the question of mining directed against the enemy&apos;s ships of war hasto be kept in mind  in relation  to its possible concurrent restraint  on merchantshipping.     4.   The blockade could be, conducted at  a distance, and its efficiency reinforced by the activities of submarines nearer the blockaded area.     5.  The interpretation  that  may  be  placed by the  U.S.A.  on  the &quot;Monroe Doctrine,&quot;  in reference to  blockade directed against  Mexican,  Central or South American ports or coast lines is not a matter for the Admiralty.Admiralty, S.W. 1,    January 14, 1928.
 ADMIRALTY REMARKS ON MR.  CRAIGIE&apos;S MEMORANDUM, CP. 258  (27) (vide  PAPER                                   No. B.R. 9).      MR. CRAIGIE  suggested that there  were possibilities of agreement with the U.S.A.  as regards belligerent rights in the matter of       (1.) Detention;  but he later stated in CP. 287 (27) (vide Paper No. B.R. 9) that            one of the principal difficulties to be anticipated related to the diversion            of ships to home ports for visit and search.      (2.) Doctrine of  &quot;continuous voyage&quot; as applied to contraband.      (3.) Jurisdiction of Prize Courts.      (4.) Navicert System.      (5.) Black List, bunker coal, insurance, banking facilities.     He anticipated that &quot; it may not be impossible to agree with  the U.S.A. on a reasonably adequate and flexible list of contraband to form the foundation of any list to be issued on the declaration of war and to be, subject to mutual revision from time to  time &quot; (vide page 10 of CP. 258 (27) ), and that it would not be possible to agree as to the rationing of a neutral bordering upon a belligerent  State, nor to our practice in the late war regarding seizure and censorship of mails,  nor to reprisals, though  he regarded this as  not beyond the bounds of possibility.  His estimate  of blockade put this question in a category of its own,  and this question has already been dealt with in Appendix I.     2.   It will be seen that the possibilities of agreement regarding detention are not optimistic.  In the opinion of the Admiralty, there is very httle chance at present of obtaining American consent to the practice  of detention, which  practice is con- sidered essential in a modern important war.     As regards mails, it may be remarked that the position is understood to be that The Hague Convention will  not be  denounced,  but  in a great war  we should  carry out  the  procedure in the last  war, when  the  Convention was not interpreted as hampering us unduly.  This question of mails is,  however, not entirely  a Naval matter,  as without censorship of mails no financial blockade, for what it is worth, would be possible, and without censorship of mails many of the  activities of our enemies  would not become known to our Intelligence Service.  The censorship of mails is, of course, very important as furnishing information regarding the destina- tion of cargoes.  Taking the Government Services as a whole, could the  censorship of mails  be dispensed with in an important war,  particularly a continental war?     3.   Assuming an agreement was reached with the U.S.A. on the five points mentioned above, the Admiralty would have no  objection, as the proposition is that British practice in these points should be adopted, but, of course, in  connection with the Navicert System this country would have  to be  the judge of  the goods to be certified, not the neutral country, whose aim would be to keep down the list of con- ditional  contraband goods as  low as possible.   No concession can be made in the matter of abandoning the right  of detention or of  &quot; continuous voyage&quot; in relation to-contraband, nor as to the jurisdiction of  our Prize Courts. In practice it is con- templated that when a vessel is detained it  should only be deflected  to a convenient port, and that the right of detention be sparingly exercised in areas distant from the chief zones of interception of shipping.     4.  It is essential that this country should  have full latitude in the  matter of contraband, i.e., as to  the articles to be included  in the Absolute and Conditional Contraband Lists according to the  circumstances  of  each particular war.  The Admiralty cannot agree in advance to any basic list which is to  be regarded asbinding in a future war; liberty to alter the list on or after the outbreak of warmust be  preserved.  Nor can any concession be  made  in the matter of retaliation,and with the experience of the last war it is not seen how we could agree to dispense with the rationing of neutrals  as a last resort.  The importance  of seizure and
censorship  of mails is recognised in a Foreign Office Memorandum (CP. 258 (27),page 12), and the Admiralty is, as stated above, not the only Department interestedin this subject.    5.  The implications in the Memorandum are that concessions will be necessaryin order to obtain agreement with the U.S.A.   The Admiralty  are  opposed tocommencing overtures  from  a  conviction that no agreement  would  be possible without essential existing rights being sacrificed.    6.  On the other hand, if we make a  sincere endeavour in any future war inwhich the U.S.A. is a neutral to avoid, as far as possible, rousing the national feelings of the U.S.A.; by the manner in which we apply  the principles of sea power, the chances,  such as they  are,  of drawing  her  into  the war  will  be lessened.   Thefollowing are examples  of methods by which we might temper our rights :     (a.) Restrict right of visit and search of ships to the vicinity of enemy territory           as  was done in the Boer War.  In that case neutral  ships were immune           except in the vicinity of non-Mediterranean African ports.    (&amp;.) Pre-empt instead of confiscating contraband goods produced in the country           of  export.    (c.) Exercise sparingly the practice of  detention.    7.  The occasions when the full exercise of belligerent rights at sea are essential for coercing an enemy  cannot be prophesied, but if the Admiralty suggestions inconnection with the  so-called  &quot; League &quot; blockade were  adopted, we should seldomfind ourselves  &quot; with our backs against the wall,&quot; compelled to exercise our rights to the utmost; but we can concede no relaxation of these rights or come to a workingunderstanding as to the occasions on which these rights will be exercised,  as it isimpossible to  foresee what  situation may  arise out of any  particular war  in thefuture.    8.  The knowledge that full belligerent rights may be exercised by this countryis one of the  strongest deterrents  to  war  on the part of our possible opponents.Even if the U.S.A. be considered as a possible enemy, certain important facts must bekept  in mind which the Executive of the U.S.A.  would have gravely to considerbefore they even threatened to join in a war against the British Empire if we were at war with a European Power.    The export trade of the  U.S.A.  is divided as follows:          British Empire (less1 Canada, Newfoundland and West Indies) 25 per cent.         European countries-41 per cent.     If the U.S.A. went  to war with the British Empire, we should, using the methodsof economic pressure used during the Great  War, be in a position to cut off her exporttrade  to the European countries, and as  her  export trade to  the Empire would automatically cease, she would immediately be faced with  a loss of 66 per cent.(less the percentage to the country with whom we were at war) of her normal trade,with  no outlet to which it could be directed.   The U.S.A. would also lose the extratrade with the Empire  due to our requirements in war.     This extra trade would  far  exceed any loss due to the  stoppage of the U.S.A.trade with the Power with whom we were at war.     These facts alone would make the U.S.A, inevitably reluctant to go  to war with us, apart from their knowledge of the commercial dislocation that the Great War hasdemonstrated to  be the sad sequel  for an  indefinite number of years.   The U.S.A.would obviously be still  more reluctant to go to war if the war were a &quot; League &quot; warand Members  of the League carried out a boycott of American commerce.     9.  The likelihood of the  U.S.A. entering a war against us on the grounds of theexercise of our  belligerent rights is overrated.  The  pretexts on which she wouldthreaten us with war are presumably considered to be  in connection with :--     (a.) Some item in the Contraband List;     (&amp;.) The application of the doctrine  of &quot; continuous voyage &quot; to blockade:     (c.)  The censorship of mails;   -     (d.) The deviation  of American ships for search;     (e.)  Our exercise of the right of search of vessels in neutral convoy;but are the U.S.A. likely to go to war on these grounds ?
     The right to insert an article in the Contraband List is a  measure that fallsincontestably within recognised belligerent rights.  The right of  detention has been recognised in  British, French and German  Prize Courts and incorporated in theItalian Naval  Code.   The right to search vessels in neutral convoy was claimed by the TJ.S.A. up to 1900 in their Naval Instructions and, in any case, the claim toexercise this right does not necessarily mean that the right itself will be exercisedon the High Seas, but that if we are not allowed to satisfy ourselves as to  the cargoesat the port of departure of the convoy, the right will be exercised.  The legal positionconnected with the censorship of mails would not form a good pretext for the U.S.A.to declare war.  There remains the question of &quot; continuous voyage &quot; in referenceto blockade.  This might form a pretext but, on  the other hand, the U.S.A. mustsurely pay regard to the loss of their own trade if they declare war, as was indicated above.  They must also pay some regard to the fact that they have no claim to takeadvantage of the war to increase their trade with our  enemy through  contiguousneutrals.  Their action prolongs the war. Is it not highly improbable that the U.S.A.would enter a war  to  protect  private commercial interests 1  National calamity orinsult is generally necessary to provoke war.     10.  The Executive  of the U.S.A. are  very unlikely to declare war on us until there has been a national demand for war, and  it is not seen  how this nationaldemand will be quickly aroused, because a small portion of American trade is beinginterfered with at a time when there will be, in all probability, a big war boom in trade with this country as long as the U.S.A. remains neutral.     11.  Mr. Craigie, in Section III  of his Memorandum, refers to the balancingof a legal right to enforce a stringent blockade against  a legal right to guaranteeour food supplies in time of war.  This question will not be discussed in detail, butas regards the guaranteeing of our  food supplies and raw materials in time of war,the following fact should be remembered :      In 1926 the percentage of tonnage of ships entering and clearing British portswith cargo was about 65 per cent. British and.  35  per cent,  foreign.  The transportof practically the whole of our food supplies of all kinds from the Dominions is inBritish ships, as is also a large  amount of  that imported  from the U.S.A.  It isestimated that the  percentage of food-stuffs imported in British ships  is at least80 per cent.  It follows  that our necessary supplies cannot  be carried in  sufficient quantities  in  neutral  ships.  Unless therefore,  our  own  ships, when we are abelligerent, are immune from capture, our supplies are not assured except in so faras protection can be afforded by our Navy.     Immunity to neutral shipping would not alone secure our supplies in war.Admiralty, S.W. 1,    January 14, 1928.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment,Printed for the  Committee of Imperial Defence.  March 1928.SECRET.WB.R. 20.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Belligerent Rights.BELLIGERENT  RIGHTS  AT SEA.NOTE BY THE PROCURATOR-GENERAL.    IN accordance with the  decision of the  Sub-Committee on Belligerent rights at the  second  Meeting, held  on the  6th  February,  1928  (B.R.  2nd  Minutes,Conclusion 2), the annexed  Memorandum has been prepared after consultation withrepresentatives  of  the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, who were designated forthe purpose by the  Sub-Committee. It has been read and approved by the Attorney-General.    The Memorandum deals with the various belligerent rights in the order adoptedby the Admiralty memorandum on the same subject (Paper No. B.R. 14).    It will be seen that the differences which exist  between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the United States  are not so much  with regard to basic principles ofinternational law  as  with  regard to the  application of  those  principles to the changed circumstances of modern naval warfare.   It may, indeed, be almost saidthat the only matter on which an absolute divergence of principle is known to existis with regard to the  right to visit and search ships in convoy, but in any futurenaval war this question, which did not  substantially arise  between 1914 and 1918,might well become of the first  importance.  -    Subject to the  above, and ignoring the possibility that the United States policyis to secure the exemption  of private property  from capture at sea by a completerewriting of international law on the subject,  it would seem not  impossible to secure agreement with  the United States on broad, questions of  general principle;  butagreement on the scope and application  of those principles  seems likely to be moredifficult if only for the  reason  that  it is impossible to foresee  in any given casethe particular state of facts on which the question  of  principle would be invoked.It should also be borne in mind that the &quot; American view &quot; of these questions maybe liable to vary according as  it is based on (1) the American Prize Court  decisions(of which there are none of importance  since the Civil War), (2) the policy of theNavy Department,  and (3) the views  of  the State Department  as to existing inter-national law.  It may be thought  that  the United  States,  when their  naval  staff have had time to think the matter out,  would be unwilling to  obstruct the fullestexercise of belligerent rights by their Navy in time  of  war; but it does not follow that  their interpretation of those rights, and  of the  manner  in which  they canlegitimately be exercised, would be the same at a time when the  United States were themselves neutrals.    It  is thought that the  statement could not  usefully indicate which belligerentrights must be considered essential as opposed to those which, though desirable, arenot vital to British interests.   An expression of opinion on a matter  of this kind would seem to be more appropriately  embodied in a separate statement prepared bythe Admiralty  themselves;  but in some cases  attention  has  been called to  theimportance of a particular point from the legal aspect.(Signed)M.

MEMORANDUM.                  (a) and  (b).  Visit, Search  and &quot; Detention.&quot;     1.  &quot; Visit and  Search &quot;  is  the traditional name for the  process whereby abelligerent ascertains whether  a vessel and/or cargo can be legally captured.  Theright of a belligerent to subject a vessel to visit and search is beyond doubt.  The modeof exercising it is a matter of dispute.     2.  Before 1914 it was the generally accepted rule that  the decision as to captureand the capture should be made at sea.  During the war, however, the practice wasadopted of diverting to  a British port, without any preliminary examination, all vessels proceeding up-channel  or  north of Scotland.   At  that port the vessel was placed in  the custody of the Customs.  The Customs carried out such physical searchas  was considered necessary.   Particulars  as  to the  vessel  and  her cargo weretelegraphed to London for consideration by the Contraband Committee.  The decision whether the vessel and /or any part of her cargo  was to be seized was telegraphed tothe Customs, and it was  only on receipt of  such instructions by the Customs at theport where the vessel lay that  it or its cargo or  part cargo  was seized as Prize.Pending the receipt of instructions from London, the vessel was  described as being&quot; under detention.&quot;     3.  There is no right  of diversion and detention as such.  The diversion of vesselsinto port, and  their detention  there while a belligerent, decides  whether or not to seize them as Prize are justifiable only as being necessarily incident to the exerciseunder modern conditions of the admitted right of visit and search.     4.  During the war, France,  Germany and Italy  all  adopted the practice ofdiverting  vessels into port for, examination there.     5.  The United States asserted during  the period of  their neutrality (a) thatsearch must be made on the high seas, and  (5) that in deciding  whether or not to seize as Prize the belligerent must have regard solely to such evidence as, was revealedby the examination of the ship  and her papers.     6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government contended (a) that  an  effective physical searchon the high seas was impracticable, and (b) that a belligerent was entitled, in deciding whether or  not to seize  as  Prize,  to: have regard to  all the information  in  his possession, however obtained,&apos;  and that accordingly,  in most  cases,  the decision whether a ship  was to  be  seized  as Prize could not be taken  until after  herarrival in port.  The bulk of the diplomatic discussion was concerned with the first point. It is, however, the second which raises the real question of principle.     7.  Neutral vessels were not  sent into  British  ports and, there held primarily for the purpose of facilitating physical search.  They were held in order that  the contraband Committee might, with particulars of the vessel and her cargo before it,examine such information as it  was able to collect from any source with regard to the shipowners, charterers, shippers and receivers of the goods,  &amp;c.  In the case ofvessels bound for neutral ports, visit and search and examination of  papers on, thehigh seas  can, In  the ordinary case, reveal nothing.   The decision whether the vessel,or any part of  her cargo, should be seized must  be based upon extraneous evidence,and must  accordingly be  made by persons on shore and in  a position to collect and examine all relevant information.     8.  To sum up :-     (1.) During the war the right of visit and search was exercised in a novel form.     (2.) There was before  1914 no established practice of  diverting neutral vessels           from their course and holding them in port pending a decision.   It was,           however, adopted by the principal Naval belligerents on both sides.     (3.) It is impossible to control supplies to the enemy through adjacent neutral           countries without extending the right of visit and search so as to include           the right of detaining pending enquiry.     (4.)  The  United States as neutrals denied the validity of this extension, and           their  Naval.Instructions of June 1917 indicate that they adhere to this           attitude.                                  (c.) Seizure.     9.  The right of seizing vessels and their cargoes with a view to claiming theircondemnation  by a competent Court of Prize in  accordance with the  recognisedprinciples of international law  is undisputed.
00 d                                 (d.) Blockade.    10.  The right of blockade is. the right to prevent, by means of warships,, access to or departure from a defined part of the enemy&apos;s coast.  In order to be binding a blockade must be effective, i.e., it must.be maintained by a force, sufficient to renderhazardous such access or departure.   Breach of a blockade of this kind alone is aground for the condemnation of the ship and cargo.    11.  No such blockade was declared and enforced by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or their Allies in the waters of Western Europe during the war;  but severalblockades of this description were declared and enforced in other theatres.    12.  The right of blockade is undisputed, but difficulties arise as to (1)  theapplication  of the  doctrine of continuous voyage to  blockade (this is  dealt withbelow), and  (2) the question whether  the blockading  force may be stationed at  a distance from the blockaded coast.  The United States were disposed to admit thelatter in the diplomatic correspondence during the war.    13.  In considering the question of &quot; blockade,&quot; confusion arises in two ways :     (1.)  The term  was often employed (as,  e.g., in the Armistice conditions) as a          convenient short description of all the measures taken to exert economic          pressure on Germany.    (2.)  The measures announced by the Order in Council of the 11th March, 1915           (the  first  retaliatory Order  in  Council),  were, in  the first instance,          described as a blockade by His Maje,sty&apos;s Government and discussed as          such in the correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the          United  States.  When, however, the. validity  of these measures was          argued in the Prize Court and the Privy Council, they were justified solely          on the ground that they were legitimate acts of retaliation,  and it was          not sought to defend them as a blockade.  To have defended them as such          would have involved the assertion that the doctrine, of  continuous voyage          is applicable to blockade.                               (e.)  Contraband.    14.  Tor the purpose of  applying the  law of contraband,  International Lawdivides goods into three classes :      (1.) Goods exclusively used for warlike purposes (absolute contraband).    (2.) Goods which may  be  used for  either  warlike  or  peaceful purposes          (conditional contraband).    (3.) Goods which are exclusively used for peaceful purposes.    15.  Absolute contraband is liable to condemnation on proof  that  it is goingto the enemy country.    16.  For the condemnation of conditional  contraband proof  is required, notmerely that it is going to the enemy country, but that it is going there to be used formilitary purposes.  This  may be taken to mean for use by the enemy government or its armed forces.    17.  As to  the articles  which  fall within any  one of the  three categoriesmentioned above,  there has never been any general rule.  Belligerents have alwayssought to enlarge the  first  class at the expense of the second, and the second at theexpense of the third, and neutrals have always objected, and it may be assumed that this will be  so in the future.  The Declaration  of London sought to resolvethese differences by defining certain articles as being absolute,  certain others asbeing  conditional contraband (subject in each case to  the right of a belligerent  toextend the list),  and by declaring that certain other articles could not be declared to be contraband at  all.    18.  The Declaration of London lists  were not  adopted  by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  The contraband list was the subject of frequent alterations, and thefinal list of 2-7-17 was of an extraordinarily comprehensive character.    19.  The distinction  between absolute and  conditional  contraband was (at all events  formally)  observed  in  practice.  A  Foreign Office publication  of  13-4-16stating all the articles on the list of contraband seemed to indicate that it was theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to treat the distinction as inoperative.  Theview expressed in that publication was,  however, never put forward in the prize court.       [17366]                                                        B 2
    20.  The observance by the Prize Court of the principle became, however, littlemore than formal, and few instances are known of consignments of any size of goodson the conditional contraband list found to be destined for an enemy country whichescaped condemnation on the ground that there  was no  evidence that they weredestined for the enemy Government or its armed forces.    21.  The United States twice at least indicated their intention of questioningthe validity  of the  contraband  list.    No protest was   in  fact  received.   TheMemorandum of the views of the United States presented at the London Conferenceasserted the right of a belligerent to modify the contraband list.    22.  The differences between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United states as to  the treatment of contraband are not differences of principle.   The objectionstaken were to the applications of the principles and in particular to the rules ofevidence adopted by the Prize Court (as to this point see paragraphs 28 to 39 below).                             (f.)  Un-neutral  Service.    23.  The &quot;right to  prevent un-neutral service,&quot; or rather  the right  to punishby  condemnation neutral vessels which have engaged in  such service,  is  fully recognised in International Law.  During the war the British Prize Courts hadnot to deal with many cases of un-neutral service, and it  is not thought that their decisions went beyond the rules which would be generally  admitted and which wereembodied in Articles  45 and 46 of the Declaration  of London.    Speaking generally,therefore, it is  not  considered that this question is likely  to give rise to difficulties,but points which must be regarded as  still to some extent unsettled are :  (1) Theremoval of persons  belonging to the armed forces of the enemy from a neutral ship,even though  the circumstances are not such as to justify the capture of the  ship(this was allowed by Article 47 of the Declaration of. London);  (2) the removal froma neutral ship  of enemy agents who are not members  of  the armed forces, or theliability of the ship to condemnation by reason of the carriage of such persons;  thisquestion was the subject of controversy with the United States during the war in thecase of the &quot; China,&quot; when  the enemy agents were ultimately released.        (g.)  The Doctrine of Continuous Voyage  or ultimate Destination.(1.) Contraband.    24.  According to - the  doctrine of  continuous voyage (or, as it is sometimescalled, of  ultimate  destination),  the mere fact that goods  which could be shown tohave ultimate enemy  destination  were to be discharged from the carrying  vessel atan intermediate neutral  port  does not exempt them from, seizure.   At the time ofthe London Naval Conference of 1909, the application of the doctrine to contrabandwas still a subject  of dispute.   In the Declaration of London a  compromise wasreached by applying the doctrine to absolute but not to conditional contraband.During the  war the British Prize Courts held that, in relation to contraband, the doctrine had become part of the law of nations at the commencement of the war.    25.  The United States are fully committed to the application of the doctrineto contraband.   This application was first made by their  Prize Courts during theCivil  War and  it is fully recognised in their Naval Instructions of  1917.  although there  is a lack  of definite evidence as to modern Continental opinion, it is thoughtthat it may  reasonably  be  assumed that the application of the doctrine both toabsolute and conditional contraband may now be  regarded as  forming part of established  international law.   But difficulties may,  of course,  arise as to theevidence which is necessary to justify the application of the doctrine to particularshipments;  according to the English decisions during the war it is the intention ofthe person who at the time of seizure is in a position to control the destination whichis really material, but it is not certain that  the United States  or an international tribunal might not  hold  that it is necessary to establish an intention on the part ofthe shippers that the goods should reach the enemy.(2.) Blockade.    26.  This  question  forms the subject of a recent Report of the Legal Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee  on  Trading and Blockade in Time of War(Paper No. L.C. 28),  to which reference may  be made, as it is difficult to deal withthe matter briefly.   As no blockade (in the technical sense)  of Germany was declared
during the war, no case arose in which the British Prize Courts were invited to apply the doctrine of Continuous Voyage  to blockade,  and. it is at present  impossible tosay what view they would take of such an application.  The Continental view may beassumed, at any  rate at present, to be opposed to the application of the doctrineto blockade, and  it is certainly impossible to say that such  application is  generally recognised by international law.    27.  The  position of the United States in this  respect is  somewhat  peculiar.The only cases in which it can be said that the doctrine of  Continuous Voyage hasbeen applied to blockade are certain decisions of  the American Prize Courts in theCivil  War,  and  the United States was  the only country which, at the london conference,  made any attempt to uphold such application.   To this  extent it maybe said that the United States have favoured the claim which the Admiralty desireto make, but it is important to bear in mind (1) that the Civil War decisions referredto are distinctly  obscure,  (2) that the American delegates  did  not insist  on their original position  at the London Naval Conference and it is  not maintained in their1917 Instructions, and (3)  that  during  the  Civil War their Prize Court expresslydeclined to apply the doctrine  to cases where the subsequent transportation wasto be  by land, and  that therefore there are no American authorities which  couldbe cited in favour of an attempt to  apply  the doctrine to the carriage of  goods toa European  port  with the intention that they should be forwarded by  land to someother  European country.                          (h.) Evidence and Procedure.    28.   New Prize Court Rules which had been  under consideration  for some time were issued  after the outbreak of war.   They effected a substantial change  in theprocedure of the  Court.    29.   Under  the old procedure,  there was a preliminary hearing, at which theonly evidence  admissible was that  derived  from an  examination of the  capturedship and of her papers and from Interrogatories (of a standardised and exceedinglyelaborate nature)  administered to the Captain and/or  members of the  crew.    30.  If  upon this evidence at the preliminary hearing the case was clear, con-condemnation or restitution was decreed at once. If,  however, the case was left in doubt&quot;further proof &quot;  was allowed, i.e., either the claimants or the captors  were allowedto produce further evidence in resolution of the doubt.  This opportunity was allowedmore  readily to   claimants than to  captors.  On the production of  such further evidence  there was a second hearing and a final decree.    31.  This was also the United States procedure, and it is believed that  the Oon-continental system was not dissimilar.    32.  The  Rules of 1914 abolished entirely the  preliminary hearing.   Theyassimilated the procedure in Prize, to the modern procedure  in ordinary civil  causes and provided that &apos;&apos; the causes  .... shall be heard  upon the  affidavit as to shippapers, and the ship papers, if any, exhibited thereto either alone or upon such otherevidence as the Judge may direct.&quot;   In  fact, the widest latitude was permitted both to the Crown and  the  claimants in the admission of evidence, and objection wasrarely, if ever, taken to the admissibility or form  of any evidence tendered.    33.  The  practice of  the French, German and Italian  Courts during- the warseems to have been assimilated to that of this country.    34.  The United States objected (1) to the abolition under the new Rules of thepreliminary hearing with its limitation of the evidence admitted,  and (2) to the pro-visions of certain Orders in Council under which in certain circumstances, e.g., wheregoods were consigned &quot; to order,&quot; the onus of proof was on claimants to prove theirgoods innocent of an enemy destination.    35.  The  first objection  was bound up with the American contentions withregard to visit and search mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 8 above.   The maintenanceof their attitude on these matters involves of necessity the proposition  that, even ifa belligerent is possessed  of positive evidence that goods of a contraband nature,though documented for discharge in a neutral port, are, in fact, the property of anddestined for an enemy Government, cannot be seized and/or condemned.    36.  It is to be noted that the United States contention was not that extraneousevidence was never permissible, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not entitledto use it in deciding whether or not to seize, and could only pray it in aid if and whenthe Court, after a preliminary hearing confined to evidence derived from the ship andthe Interrogatories, was left in doubt.
    . 37.   The objection taken to the establishment of presumptions against, claimantsby Orders in Council was one of form rather than substance.  It may be regarded asreasonably certain that the Prize Court would as an ordinary matter of evidence have regarded the onus  as being on the claimants in the circumstances contemplated bythe Orders in Council,  and from the point of view of the Crown they were probablyunnecessary.     38.   Imports of a  particular  kind of goods into a neutral country shown to bemarkedly in  excess of imports in  prerwar years, combined  with the  existence  of an export trade from  that country to an enemy country, were regarded by  the  prize court as creating a presumption of enemy destination against any  particular ship-ment of that class of goods.   The United  States objected to the  validity of thisstatistical argument. Their objection was, in fact, inconsistent with the view  takenby their  own Courts of  similar facts less precisely  proved during the Civil  War.     39.   In  circumstances similar to  those of the late war, the  unfettered use ofextraneous evidence would probably again be vital if  effective pressure is to be put upon the enemy.  The United  States must be regarded  as still denying the legitimacyof the use of such evidence, but the  grounds of their objection are of a purely technicalcharacter and are unlikely to stand the test of practice.      (i.) The  Right to Examine  Ships  under Convoy of Neutral Warships.    40.   British practice has always upheld  this right, but it has been disputed  for more than a century; at the London Naval Conference the only other country which did not in terms reject it was  Germany, and it was abandoned in Articles 61 and 62of the Declaration of London. The United States, at any  rate since 1909, must betaken to be definitely opposed to the claim in question, though their  Naval Instruc-tions recognise, as does Article 62 of the Declaration of London,  that the convoyingState is  under some degree of responsibility  as to satisfying itself of the  innocenceof the shipments convoyed.  In these circumstances  it is not possible to regard theclaim as sanctioned by international law, but in  view of the difficulty, in modern conditions, of the convoying State  satisfying itself of the innocent  destination of theconvoyed cargoes, it is plain that the admission of the right of convoy might seriously prejudice the exercise of belligerent rights at sea.                (j.) Censorship of Mails and Seditious Literature.    41.  Before  1907 no general  rule existed as to the right  Of a belligerent tointerfere with mails.  The trend of opinion, however, was towards treating them asexempt  from all  interference.  There is no  instance  before  1914 of a belligerentclaiming the right to open letters in mails found on the high seas.    42.  In 1907 His Majesty&apos;s Government became party  to a  Convention (hague convention No. XI) which provided inter alia that &quot;the postal correspondence neutrals&apos;or belligerents, whether official or private  in character, which may be found on board a neutral or enemy  ship at sea is  inviolable.&quot;  . None of the belligerentsobserved this Convention in the sense of treating it as precluding them from openingand examining private mails found on the high seas.    43.  Before  March 1916  His Majesty&apos;s  Government did not interfere at  allwith any mails, except  those which.in one form or another came voluntarily into aBritish port.  So  far as  such mails  are concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government were, ofcourse, entitled to exercise such rights as were available to them under their ownmunicipal law.  After March 1916 the mails  of vessels brought from the high seaswithin the jurisdiction by force Were examined.    44.   The only  ground on which the opening and examination of such letterscan be justified is as an exercise of the right  of search for  the purpose1 of deciding whether  the contents are liable to condemnation.  It  follows, therefore, that thereis, strictly speaking, no belligerent  right of censorship as  such.  The fact that abelligerent is entitled to open letters provides him With an opportunity of making and keeping a copy  of the! contents of such letters as he cannot claim to condemn.    45.   All the naval belligerents exercised the  right of  opening mails.   TheUnited  States  conceded the  right of  opening mails for the purpose  of  deciding whether their contents were liable tb condemnation.    46.   In  1916 His MajestyV Government decided that there  were grounds onwhich condemnation could be sought of seditious literature as such.  The matternever came before the Prize  Court, and the legal validity of this contention  is a
Storey&apos;s Gate, S.W. 1,     March 1928.omatter of speculation.   If the contention could not be maintained, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not in the absence of a blockade be justified in interfering at allwith outward bound mails.    47.  The justification in the Prize Court of the seizure of  goods ostensiblydestined for  neutral countries depended to a. very large extent indeed on evidencesupplied by the censorship, and it is not easy to see how any  considerable measureof interference  with traffic through neutral countries could be maintained if the sources  of  supply used during the late war by reason of the practically completesupervision over cables,  wireless messages and  postal  correspondence were notavailable.  This subject  is discussed at length in the Report  of  the Legal  Sub-Committee (Paper No. L.C. 26).           (k.) The Right to Arm Defensively British Merchant Ships.    48.   This is based on a long established practice, and the  questions to which itgives rise relate, in the first instance, rather to the relations between the belligerentsthan to those between the belligerent which armed the merchant ships and neutrals.The neutrals&apos; interest arises over the admission of such vessels to neutral ports onthe footing of merchantmen.  During the war nearly all neutral countries (Holland,however, excepted)  so admitted them, but the question is one which may give rise to difficulties  at any  time,  and the action  of neutrals  is likely  to  depend on thecircumstances as they then exist. (1.) The Right to  Retaliate  against a Belligerent who breaks International Law,         Treaty Obligations or the Customary Usages of Naval Warfare.    49.   It is impossible to deal  with this question summarily.   The right to retaliate for breaches of the  laws of war is generally admitted; the main questionwhich arises is whether measure of retaliation must be confined to action which hurtsthe enemy  alone, or whether such measures are legitimate, even though they may affect the interests of neutrals.   The British Prize Courts have upheld the  viewthat retaliatory action may be justified notwithstanding that it affects the rightsof neutrals, but  it is certainly  not safe to assume  that this view  is a generally accepted doctrine of international law, or would be so regarded by the United States.
