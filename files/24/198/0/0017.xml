MEMORANDUM BY  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I CIRCULATE herewith a  draft of the note which I propose to send to M. Poincare in  accordance with  the arrangement made in Paris onthe  19th  instant  and  a diagram,  showing  how our  proposals  would work out  on the  basis of a German annuity  of J6100 millions.October 24, 1928.    1.  The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of debts and reparations is based as  heretofore on the Balfour  Note, under which(not as a matter of bargaining, but  as  a voluntary act  of renunciation)His Majesty&apos;s Government  undertook  to limit their claims  upon their allies to  such  amount  as,  with the receipts  of Great  Britain fromreparations, would suffice to meet the liabilities they had incurred to theUnited States in respect  of War Debts.    As  was made clear  in  the  Anglo-French and Anglo-Italian Agree-ments, the share of Reparations payable  to the British Dominions  and colonies cannot  be taken in account in the calculation of British receiptsfor this  purpose, as these payments in iio. way benefit  the taxpayer inthe United Kingdom.                       -&apos;                .t    2.  Up to  the present time, the payments of Great Britain to  theUnited  States have  substantially exceeded  the;ireceipts  from  German - [i8346]  -  - -         -  ;W. S.  C.
reparations  and Allied, debts together  and there  is  an  accumulateddeficiency which, amounts with  interest to upwards of  180  millions.During the present financial year for the. first time,  ther receipts  and payments shpujd; approximately balance, and it is essential  that  in  anyne\y .settlement&apos; with Germany  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government should be assured, that: this  balance between the receipts  and payments of GreatBritain should be maintained.   ... His Majesty&apos;s Government conceive that it is the common aim of allth-epfeditoi&apos;.Governments that any new  settlement with Germany must,in. the first place, fully cover the liabilities they have  each  to meet inrespect of W,ar, Debts. Their aggregate liabilities under this head amountto very considerably less than the normal annuity of  125 millions underthe Dawes  Plan, and His  Majesty&apos;s Government therefore see every reason  to,,hope that a settlement &quot;could be reached with Germany whichwould, cover not only these  liabilities.and the comparatively small shareof1.  reparation^ ;j&apos;due Jo  the United  States and to the  other  Powers(including the&apos;British Dominions) which are not indebted  to  America,but would provide a balance available towards the costs of reconstructingthe^devastatedregions. ;.   .....    In this connexion, His.Majesty&apos;s Government are bound to point outthat,  under the terms of the Balfour-Note, they should recover, not  onlytheir  future  payments  to  the  United  States  of  America,  but  the accumulated deficiency of  180 millions referred to above.  His Majesty&apos;sGoyerniiient, would however hot regard  the recovery,  in  full,  of  this deficiency as an essential condition of any new settlement provided  thatthe  other creditor Powers  are  willing  to  agree that the  Allied  debtliabilities should in future be the first charge on the German  annuitiesand that any supplementary payments towards the costs, of reconstructingthe devastated regions should be kept within such  limits as would notendanger the security for the debt payments.    On  this  understanding,, His, Majesty&apos;s Government for their  part would be willing to refer  the question of the total annuities to  be  paidby Germany to&apos; an expert Committee for examination and they would beprepared to accept the  conclusions of. such a Committee even  though it involved  some sacrifice of their fullclaim in  respect of the accumulateddeficiency due. to Great Britain up to date.          ,.               &apos;     It is necessary to observe that, at present, the costs of the  Armies ofOccupation in the rhineland substantially diminish the receipts -availablefor Reparations,  and in ; order  to make the  largest  possible  amount available for Reparations, these costs should be brought to an end  as soon&apos;as possible.  ,     :    . &apos; . &apos;, &apos;           ...   .   .           .     3.  The  question of mobilising the capital Reparation  Debt by the marketing of German bonds appears to  His Majesty&apos;s Government  to be a question of expediency rather than of principle.  Unless  the  German Government  are  prepared to undertake the service of reparation loans

They feel that, on  this matter, the advice of ahExpert Financial Committee might be most valuable, and they would beglad to invite such a Committee to examine the steps ilk&amp;frd^ffa fatipnto prepare the way for a  market operation, without prejudice0 to therights of the Allied Governments  thereafter to decide whether Wqcli an operation is expedient.                                       ;:v : ;   &quot;     4.   Finally His Majesty&apos;s Government, when  concluding the  DebtAgreement of  July 1926,  consented to large diminutions&apos;ofthe  totalFrench  indebtedness  to  Great  Britain  on  the  assumptiom  ^hat  theAgreement would be speedily ratified and that the resulting  payments would be upon the sole credit of France.  &quot;While  they must adhere tothis position  and press for early ratification on this basis in any event,such ratification would, in particular,  be an indispensable part Of&apos;airy newsettlement that may be reached.                                    *
