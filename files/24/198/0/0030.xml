frWTS DOC IMS NT IS THE! PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO V13RKM5NT,L 0IECR3T                     0 A B  I N S T                Copy No.                      LOCAL GOVSgNj^NT BILL               Memorandum by the Minister of Health.        I  attach the latest edition of the Local Government Bill        after  inclusion of various amendments suggested in the        Home Affairs Committee.    1.           At the request of the Committee I. have made a        careful examination of the Bill in order to see what        clauses might be considered as inessential to the main        structure of the oombined scheme of de-rating and local        government reform.    2,           The following appear to be the only clauses&apos; which        oould  so be described.            Part II. Registration.  Clauses 19 - 26 inolusive.            Note:  If these olauses were omitted one new clause              would have to be inserted.   Seven clauses would              thus be saved.            Part III. Town Planning. Claused 35 and 37,  Two clauses.            Part IV, Local Govornment,Clauses 41, 42, 43, 47, 49, 50,            51, 52,  Eight clauses.    3.            This makes a total of seventeen clauses.   In        estimating the time that could be saved if these were        omitted, it must be remembered- that they are not controversial        in character.   I estimate this time at two days as a maximum.    4.         ^  With regard to the Registration clauses, these are,        mutatis mutandis, the same as those comprised in the        Gunston Bill of last session, which passed through the        House  of Commons with the approval of all parties, and only        suffered shipwreck in the Lords in the rush of the last few        days.   Theydeal with the conditions of service of the
9i (fl6 i. !JRegistrars whose position has long &quot;been anomalous and who,in some cases, are rather scandalously underpaid.   The hopes of these officers, long deferred, were .raised to a highpitch last session, only to he grievously disappointed at thelast moment, and if contrary to their expectations no indication  were given now of the Government&apos;s intentionto right their wrongs I am apprehensive of grave dissatia-factlon  among them which oould hardly fail to have aprejudicial effect on their work.          As for the Town Planning and Local Governmentclauses, these are in a rather different category inasmuch as they do not deal with existing grievances or injustices.But there are a good many local administrators who would hedissatisfied if they were omitted without good reason, forthey follow naturally upon our other proposals, even if not essential to them, and they would undoubtedly he useful in facilitating the satisfactory working of our scheme.          I desire to make it clear that although I mustpress for the inclusion of all seventeen clauses at the outset,I do not claim that they should necessarily he kept in theBill, if, in the opening stages,  it becomes clear that theirabandonment would facilitate the  passage  of the Bill, andI should be glad to explain to the Cabinet, if opportunitypermits, how 1 should propose to  deal with the matter inorder to keep open this possibility without injury tothe prestige of the Government,2nd November.  1928N.C.
