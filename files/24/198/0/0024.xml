MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.    1.  IN CP. 206 (28) and CP. 211 (28) I have already called the attention ofmy colleagues to the Industrial Transference  Scheme for moving to employment inother areas part of the population from areas where regular employment is not likelyto be available for them again.    I now circulate     (a.) A report by my Department of the  work that has already been achieved          and the possibilities in the future,  and    (&amp;.) Some notes on criticisms which have  been made of the Scheme,  which may          be useful to my colleagues in their constituencies and elsewhere.    I think it will be agreed that,  having regard to the essential difficulty of thework, great progress has been made, and that, if the present rate of transfer can bemaintained,  an effective step will have been taken to deal with part of the problemof the distressed areas.   Oversea migration will also make a substantial contribu-tion, but the working out of  the programme which  Lord Lovat discussed with the.Canadian Government while on his recent visit to Canada has not yet proceeded far enough for any estimates to be practicable.    2.  I must emphasise again the importance of this policy.   The industrial transference Board, after very careful consideration, and on a conservative estimate,concluded that there were at least 200,000 workers who could not count upon regular employment in their own industry or in their  own area.  These workers  were of allages, and  with their dependents mean probably a population surplus to the require-ments of their locality and industry of about 800,000, a number  about equal to the:whole population of, say,  Manchester or Liverpool.  There  are at present 178,699miners wholly unemployed and 72,381 temporarily stopped,  and the number of thewholly unemployed is not showing any tendency to decrease.   This &quot; surplus popula-tion &quot; includes a large number of workpeople of high  employment value, and theonly sensible  method of dealing with the problem is to help  the employable part ofthe surplus  to  obtain  employment  in  other  areas.    The only  alternative  to&apos;Transference is to continue to maintain the surplus by some form of State relief,while it is slowly driven out by economic pressure. This  alternative is uneconomicaland wrong in itself and politically impossible to sustain.    3.  The Government has adopted the policy of transfer.  The  attached Reportshows the progress that is now being made with the execution of this policy.  Thesurplus  of workers is  at least 200,000.    During the  next six  months  alone theEmployment  Exchanges are aiming at transferring through their own  machinery15,000.  It may be assumed from experience  and on such tests as we are able to apply,that another 15,000 at least will transfer themselves.  There will be  a further contri-bution to reducing the surplus, not yet possible to estimate, from migration overseas.Lastly,  a  decrease of from 10,000-15,000 may be expected from the normal wastageof the industry owing to deaths or the retirement of the older men on pension.    At present, however, not enough is known  by the general public or in the&apos;depressed areas of the progress that is being made, or of the relief which transference      [18406]          &quot;                                              B
is giving to the finances of the worst areas, and as a result the Government is notobtaining the credit due to it.   At the same time;  owing largely to ignorance andmisunderstanding of all we are doing, prejudice is being created, particularly indistricts to which men are being sent.    In consequence, the Government is in danger of  getting the worst of both worlds,and the success of the scheme is being jeopardised.   There is no reason why thisshould be so if the case is stated boldly and convincingly.  For this reason  I have included a note on some of the grosser fallacies in  the objections to  the Scheme.    4.  I  should  be  doing wrong, however, if I  attempted to disguise from  mycolleagues  that the position next year will remain  serious, or that we may have to face criticisms from  opponents and apprehensions  on the part of supporters.    The main point is to realise that:&apos;-       (i.)  While the  position  is serious, apprehensions as to the probable state of            affairs (e.g., the  effect of  the  new Insurance conditions) are greatly            exaggerated.      (ii.)  The seriousness can be  minimised if the Cabinet decide  to push ahead            with schemes that will mitigate it.    (iii.)  If and only if we determine to deal  resolutely with the question  by            transference, by schemes of work  that will further  accelerate trans-            ference,  and by  migration,  it may be  possible in three years  to have            liquidated a situation of a character and seriousness such as has only            faced this country two Or three times in the economic history of the  last            500 years.                                                    (Initialled)      A.  S.-M.    Ministry  of Labour, November 1, 1928.APPENDIX I.        REPORT ON PROGRESS OF THE INDUSTRIAL TRANSFERENCE SCHEME.-1.  Direct Transfetenee.    I.  This  Scheme  is  now  making  steady progress.   The recognition  of itsnecessity  grew last autumn, and the first  organised  and comprehensive effort tomove  labour from the depressed areas began early this year, when the Ministry ofLabour, in co-operation With the Local  Education Authorities, began to move  boysout of Wales and Durham.    It.   From January to the end of  September 1928 over  1,300 boys have  been moved out of these areas into employment in other areas.   The great  majority  have moved away  from home; lodgings have been  found for them and a  friendlysupervision in their districts has been organised.  Only a very  small proportion  have gone home again.    Most of these boys have had short spells at the&apos; local Juvenile UnemploymentCentres; and attendance at these Centres is gradually being recognised as the first step to employment;  60 or 70 vacancies a week are still being obtained  for  boysfrom  the depressed areasj through the Ministry of Labour machinery.    III.  In June a  further experiment was made of  sending young single menfrom  the mining areas to other areas where employment was better, in  the knowledge that  the Exchange would be able to find employment for them, but  without.priorknowledge of a specific vacancy.  The experiment, which was designed to test theabsorptive capacity ,of certain areas, was carefully controlled  and limited in extent.During the 16 weeks Up to the end of September 1,500 men were moved in this  way,and in only about 50 cases was the experiment a failure, due in some instances to an unreasonable attitude on the part of the applicant.     When the Industrial Transference Board report was issued in July and thePrime Ministers appeal was addressed  to all employers, this experiment, which hadtaught; sOrhe  valuable lessons,  was gradually merged in the more  general effortfollowing the appeal.
&apos;  -   IV.   The bulk distribution of the Prime Ministers letter began in the thirdweek of August, and was spread over two or three weeks.  The letter has been  sentto about 166,000 employers.     There appears to have been some impression that the appeal, if it succeeded,would  bring  in  a flood of offers of employment for miners; and others from thedepressed areas.    This was never intended or expected.   Industry  is hot in acondition  in which it can suddenly absorb another 50,000 men,  and the  employmentmarket does not work that way.   Certain newspapers did the  scheme  no good byfinding in it a sentimental appeal to take on additional labour that was not strictlyrequired,  and then by sighing because employers did not respond.     While the  plight of the depressed areas  cannot fail  to touch the feelings ofanyone with  imagination, the transfer scheme rests upon a solid economic basis.Every  week labour from the labour market is engaged in more  or less haphazardfashion by a number of employers all over the country. If in place of this haphazardrecourse to the labour market the employers applied to the  Employment  Exchanges,the Exchanges would be able to exercise a directional control over the source of someof the  labour, and thus,  carefully and  in small  doses  strictly graduated to  theconstitution of the local industries, introduce a number  of workpeople from thedepressed  areas into other employment.     V. After the despatch of the Prime Ministers letter the staff of the Exchangesbegan  a systematic visitation of employers to explain what was intended.    Theresults  are by no means unsatisfactory. By the end of September, six  weeks fromthe beginning of the campaign, over 4,000 vacancies had  been notified by employers for men from the depressed  areas, and 2,400 had  already  been filled, many of theremainder being in process of being filled.    Nor was this a sudden  burst.   The weekly  average of &quot;special&quot;  vacanciesobtained and  filled is rising.   At present, exclusive of boys, the weekly figure of  mentransferred directly through the Employment Exchanges  is about 400.    VI.   Although the transfers are being well distributed over all parts of thecountry, London  and the  South-East  and South-West of England  are  absorbingthe greater part.   In the Midlands the employment situation is rather less  satisfactoryat the  moment, but it is probable that this area will be able to  absorb at least 100a week. In Scotland and the North-East the absorption will be less, and very littlecontribution can be expected for some  time from the North-West and Wales, though of course  in  all  areas there is a steady trickle of labour moving away from thedepressed  areas to other employment.    VII.  The transfers are, of course, not confined to miners.   Indeed at  presentthe proportion  of &quot;skilled  vacancies&quot; offered  for transfer  is  high.&apos;  While  theopportunity is being taken to fill these from men in the depressed areas, they donot help  the  miners&apos;  problem.  In general, for other industries the miner is in competition with unskilled labour of which there is in most areas an adequate supply.     But miners are being  placed, for example,  as groundsmen, kitchen hands,concrete mixers,  in saw-mills,  in gas-works, as motor garage handymen, warehouseand  railway porters, waiters, builders labourers  and in cement works.2. Training Centres.     VIII.  The placing of  miners is greatly helped by the Ministry Of  LabourTraining  Centres, of which  there are now five, at  Wallsend, Birmingham, Dudley,Bristol and Glasgow.  The annual output of these Centres is 3,500, and as the resultof the  special canvassing efforts steadily undertaken, it  is being found possible toplace virtually the whole output into employment  immediately upon  completion oftraining.  Opportunities for extending training and maintaining effective placingsare carefully  studied, and extensions  of the scheme  will  be provided to the efullest extent  within which absorption of  the output can be secured.     Under the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training, there are 31 domestictraining  centres open,  at which  over 3,500 women and  girls are being  trainedannually.  They were given an additional grant this year for. the purpose Of extendingtheir work in the  depressed areas, and 18 of the centres; with an output of about,000 per annum, serve these areas.          &apos; ; \     IX.   In  addition to the  men who move.with the help- of the Ministry of Labour,there has  been,  since the beginning of the year,  a substantial movement of men ohtheir own.  The numbers are increasing and the movement is undoubtedly stimulated by the  transfers made with the help of the Ministry of Labour.  It is not possible to       [18406]                  &quot;                                    B 2
state, what is the total; number of men who have: moved during the present year, from&quot;the depressed,areas,:,but the following  summary of the figures given,,above may be useful.&quot;..............                                       . 5    Boys (including those from  Juvenile Training Centres)  between &apos; &apos;,&apos;        the 1st January, 1928, and the 30th September   ...       ...    1,300     Women  and  girls  (ex-training  centres) the  1st April to  the         30th September       ...      ...       ...       ...       ...    .360             (N.B. The number of centres  now in operation is larger         than it wag in the summer and the number dealt  with  at         present is about 40 a week.)     Other women.-No separate records available.     Mem--         Experimental scheme June-September   ...       ...       ...    1,500         Prime Ministers Appeal, August and September (October, at             rate  of 450 a week)       ...       ...       ...       ...    2,400).&apos;.       Men from depressed areas ex-training centres              Training places at the 30th September      ...       ...    1,200            . .    (More, extensions are  in progress.)                  Placed at rate of 55  a week.     By these various channels men and women and boys and girls from the depressed areas are being transferred through the Ministry of Labour machinery  at the rateof 600-700 per week.  If this rate can be kept up for six months, some  15., 000 willhave been moved by the end of March 1929.  It is, of course, possible that after atime transfer will become more difficult and consequently slower.   It is, however,probable  that at  least  as  many men during that period will move on their own account, so that another 15,000 may be added to the above figure.   As explained above,  it is not possible to  say how many men moved on their Own account from thedepressed areas during the first half of the year,   &quot;           &apos;-&apos;,-/&apos;       &apos;     X. . Section 18 of the Mining Industry Act, under which the coal/owners&quot;haveagreed not to engage any adult labour not previously in the coal industry, is helping to secure absorption of  miners, though in  some areas housing&apos;  difficulties ahdvtheindifference of colliery under-managers  are  preventing a full use of the  agreement.   Overseas.     -   . .. .&apos;- r,                      .          &apos;     XI.  Since the publication of the Transference Board Report the Harvesters&apos;movement to Canada took 8,500 men, mostly from the mining areas, out to&apos;Canada.As far as can be judged at present, 4,000 may be expected to stay, and we may find that a  number of those who have come  back will go out again.   The chances inAustralia of  men  from  the mining areas  are severely limited by the  comparatively small Australian requisitions, but the demand from Canada for single men willingto work in agriculture and with some rudimentary knowledge of the work is said tobe practically unlimited.  The Ministry of Labour have accordingly extended their training centres. In addition to the centres at Claydon and Brandon, another centrewill  be opened in January  in Scotland,  and further extensions are how in progress.At these centres men with no farm experience are given courses of training (usuallyfor 12 weeks), in handling  horses (harnessing, driving, ploughing, drilling, &amp;o.), inmilking and  the care of cows and in  general farm work.   Arrangements have alsobeen made for setting up during the  spring and summer  testing camps  where men will  be tested on rough open-air wOrk  to discover whether they are generally suitablefor work on the land in Canada - these courses will last about four weeks.    - - &apos; -  -     On  the  present programme, 6,000 men can be trained and tested betweenDecember and July under  the Ministry&apos;s scheme.  To secure this number, at least10,000 applications will be required, as careful selection is necessary.  The net effectof the  returning harvesters will certainly be to  retard, for  a  time, at: any rate,  the recruiting of  men  for training.                                     -;  f     Married men will also be trained, and their families maintained during training,to the extent that  openings can be found for them overseas.. 1    Under the aegis of the Oversea Settlement Department, local centres for trainingboj^s for overseas  are being extended, and,  in addition to the centre  in Newcastle,centres in Lancashire, Hull, South Wales,  and  probably in Scotland, are likely tohe started soon.                            i                           ,   &apos;   ,,
    For girls  to be trained for domestic  service- overseas  there  is one centre at market Harborough, and others  are  contemplated in the immediate future inNewcastle,  Scotland, and probably Lancashire.    It is not possible at present to give any estimate of the number of  men  andwomen from the depressed areas who can be sent overseas during next year/becausethe arrangements as to passages and as to placing in employment in Canada are  still under discussion with  the Canadian Government and the shipping and  railwaycompanies.                                                      &apos;    -          appendix II;              NOTES  ON OBJECTIONS  TO THE TRANSFERENCE  POLICY.          :&apos;     The policy of transference, and the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal to employers, havebeen criticized on various grounds :-                      .     (a.)  That it is not a cure for unemployment.     (&amp;.)  That it  is the obligation of the Government to deal with the problem of           the depressed areas,     (c.)  That it is unreasonable to ask employers to take on men whom they do  not           need.     (d.)  That it is  unfair  to the unemployed  in the locality to which  men  are           transferred.     (e.)  That it is inhuman  and delusory to the men transferred.     (/.)  That other remedies (such as  safeguarding, &quot;rationalization,&quot; the provision           of work by the State, the establishment of new industries in the depressed           areas, or the reorganization  of industry and society on a socialist basis)           should be adopted.     The case  for the  policy is argued at length in the report of the  industrial transference Board.  It may be summarized briefly as follows.    Analysis of the persons  unemployed at any given time shows that they fall into three main categories :       (i:)  Those temporarily stopped.     (ii.)  Those who have had a substantial amount of employment in recent years.     (hi.)  A smaller, but substantial, block of persons,  who have done  very  little            work, often for a long period.    The  individuals who make up the first two groups are constantly changing, andthey may all hope to obtain a substantial amount of employment in the near future.It is the third group which constitutes the serious problem.  They  are concentrated in certain industries, especially coal,  and in certain localities, and, if they remainwhere they are,  can never hope to obtain employment again.  Yet they include  largenumbers of men of high employment value.  To  leave them in their villages, where their Industry  is derelict, involves steady demoralization, an  appalling waste ofman-power, and the continuance of a canker, the evil effects of which  spread far beyond the locality.    The contrast between the different groups of &apos;-&apos; the unemployed  &quot; comes out verystrikingly if the  percentage of unemployment  among the  insured population  indifferent  localities is  examined.    The figures  for the  following areas  may  becontrasted :  London 64 per  cent.,  Leicestershire 6-8 per  cent.,  Oxford 3 per cent.,Birmingham 10-9  per  cent., as against Durham County 26-8  per cent.,  BishopAuckland 42-9 per cent., Glamorgan 26-6 per  cent.,  Merthyr Tydfil 75-9 per cent.,Aberdare 38-8 per cent.    So long as  the population remains in the depressed  areas,  the only possibilityof permanent help lies in the revival of the industry or the introduction of  new industries.  But any conceivable revival will  still leave  a large surplus, and  new industries show very little sign of starting in these places.          \?        - -    The  only conclusion is  that  large  numbers of  the  employable persons mustmigrate elsewhere.    It is true that there  is unemployment in varying  degrees elsewhere.   But,whereas in the depressed areas industry is dormant or dead, in the more prosperous
areas it is alive and growing.  The working  of-the,employment market is often-misunderstood.   Every week there are more than  120,000 labour engagements, andat all times there is a ceaseless ebb and flow of employment.  Each man taken on is.adding to a flowing stream, not  driving another out of a space of fixed dimensions.There is no artificial limit  to production or to the capacity of industry to absorbworkpeople and take on new growth like a living organism.   Notwithstanding allthe difficulties of trade, 360,000 additional workpeople have been absorbed into theindustrial structure in four years.    The policy of transfer does not therefore mean that employers are asked to  take on men whom they do not need; this was not the  Prime Minister&apos;s appeal.  Whatthey are asked to do is, in taking  on new men, to take a proportion from the depressed areas.   There is excellent material available, and  the men who have  been removedare, as a rule, doing well and giving every satisfaction to their employers.    The policy does not involve flooding any single locality with large numbers tothe serious prejudice  of the local unemployed.  The number sent to any particulartown  will only be an infinitesimal fraction of the working population.  Thus, in birmingham, where the cry of  injustice  to the local unemployed has been loudlyraised, it was found that over a period during which 156 persons had been placedin employment by the Ministry of Labour under the transference scheme,  there were probably as many as 15,000 labour engagements, in an insured population of 347,950.The miners thus took one engagement out of every 100.    As regards the  alleged inhumanity to the men themselves,  the safeguardsemployed by the Exchanges are  referred to in Appendix I.  In any case, the  menare moving of themselves, and it is better that they should be directed to jobs by theExchanges than left to tramp the streets and roads in a vague search for work.  Andthey, surely, have in equity some claim to share in  the opportunities which industryoffers; their present hopeless situation is in the main the result of great economicmovements over which they have  no control.    No other  practicable  alternative  has been  proposed  which  can  bring  theimmediate  relief required.   &quot;Rationalization&quot; and  the improvement in technical efficiency in the depressed industries almost invariably result, for a time at any rate,in increased unemployment.   Relief works  in the  depressed areas  have  long.exhausted their usefulness;  indeed,  they  are positively harmful in so far as theyencourage men  to remain where they cannot hope  for continued employment.    There is admittedly an obligation on the Government which it is doing its  best to discharge; but it rests equally  on all good citizens, and without their help theGovernment can do little.  The policy does not profess to be &quot; a cure for  unemploy-ment,&quot;  but it  is the only practicable, and it is a  hopeful way, of dealing quicklywith the hard core of unemployment.o
