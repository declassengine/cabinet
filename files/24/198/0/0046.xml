TRADE  OUTLOOK.     ^emorandum by the^Pre3ident of the Board of Trade.     I circulate, for the information of my colleagues,reports which I have received from members of my AdvisoryCouncil, regarding, the trade position and prospects.     As I anticipated, the October trade returns reflect the September improvement in industry, which I reported last month.     It appears that in October the industrial improvementof the previous month was generally maintained.     In coal export trade has improved; and there has  been some seasonal improvement in the home market.     In iron and steel the present position and theImmediate outlook are better than  two months ago.  A fewmore blast furnaces have  been re-started.  Full orders onthe Continent have resulted in re-rollers having to give ahigher price for foreign  steel.  If the Ruhr strike con-tinues, ze shall benefit.  It has  not had much effect  up to the  present.  in the Sheffield special steel trades the marked improvement of September is maintained, Canada  andSouth America proving excellent markets.     In non-ferrous metals the volume of business, though not quite as, good as last month, is still substantial  and satisfactory.     General engineering  shows no  marked change.  the expected seasonal improvement has  not materialised.  the motor trade however is better;, and good orders have been-obtained for locomotives  and for agricultural machinery.
     In the electrical trades the position i3 about the same.     Shipbuilding and marine engineering are rather slacker.Tie accumulation of orders due to the coal strike are beingworked off; and orders now depend on current requirements.     In cotton prospects are better - Large inquiries are reported from India;  and South American trade is active.     Tool remains very depressed, apart from some slightimprovement in merino cloth.  There is no doubt that thestate of the woollen and worsted trades as a whole isdeplorable.     Artificial silk remains satisfactory.     The chemical trade maintains its position; and it isgratifying to note that our fine chemical industry is steadily strengthening its hold on foreign markets.     Boots and shoes and hosiery are doing rather better.Lace under the protection of the duty is satisfactory.     Hardware and Cutlery are rather slack-  There is lessseasonal buying than usual.     Shipping freights are rather better.  Railway trafficreceipts on the other hand are about sfo down on 1927.     Mr. Lindsay&apos;s account of the effect of the Indiancotton and steel duties on British exports is interestingand satisfactory.

9 A 9O &apos;:h itsG03SFIDEMTIAL.COAL.     MR. WARHAM was glad to be able to report that In october the export coal trade, particularly in the north of England,had shown further signs of improvement and that the outlookat the moment was distinctly better.   With the approach of winter, the demand for certain classes of coal for home consumption was also Improving.   Export prices, however, were,unfortunately, still below cost of production, but more tradewas in evidence and most collieries were able to work fulltime, which-was an enormotis Improvement.   Owing tosubsidised foreign competition, it seemed unlikely that thereal exporting districts would be able to improve upon present prices to any appreciable extent.   The British Government*srailway de-rating scheme, which was to come into force on 1stDecember, would, however, certainly help to reduce the lossesat present being incurred on all coal sold for export.   Itwas Northumberland coal that Mr. Warham particularly referredto;  Durham trade had improved, but not to the same extent asthe Northumberland in export business.     Germany was also making substantial reductions of rates onthe State Railways to Hamburg etc., for bunkering purposes.Competition with Poland was still as severe as ever, and quitebeyond the power of this country to cope with.   New recordsfor the export of coal from Danzig and Gdynia were continuing tobe established.   The figure for September was 694,000 tons,or at the rate of more than 8 million tons a year, a very great increase, in fact an unexpected increase.   It had been under-stood that they would not he able to extend at such a rateuntil about 1931 when the port of Gdynia was expected to be finished, but they had already done so.   It was extraordinarythat in spite of all we had been given to understand about their mutual selling arrangements, which had always been held up asbeing very perfect, the competition between the Poles  themselvesseemed to be most acute.   They had recently obtained a norwegian State railway order for 75,000 tons best screenedsteam coal at ll/6d per ton f.o.b. Danzig or Gdynia.   this price  was at least 2/-. a ton less than the price for bestNorthumberland steam coal, with which it was in competition.Therefore, their only competitors were their own people.   It.was said that really they were cutting each other throats forthe trade In Scandinavia.   Naturally the result of all this wasthat the export from this country to Scandinavia was barelyhalf what it had been in 1913.     The output of coal in the United Kingdom for the threeweeks ended October 20th was at the rate of about 4f millionseach week, but probably the reason for that low figure was,partly, the restriction of output in various districts inScotland and the Midlands, so that it was not so bad really asit looked.   The output for the week ended 20th October was90.8 per cent of the March 1925 weekly average basis, ascompared with 87.4 per cent for the week ended September 15th.     The number of persons employed in the Industry for theweek ended October 20th was 79.6 per cent calculated on thesame basis, as compared with 79.4 per cent for the week ended september 15th.   Unemployment for the month of September  was
9 2 9c3 b c5C OHM DEM&apos;IAL.OPAL (OOITTD).21.6 per cent, as compared with 25.5 per cent, in August and 9.3 per cent. in March 1926.  The quantity ox&apos; coal exported from theUnited Kingdom in September was just under 4 million tons as corn-pared with a little over 4i million tons in August,  hut the valuehas dropped by 2d. a ton to 15/4d. as compared with 15/6d. inAugust.  The export to Spain was still falling;  last month weshipped-to Spain at the rate of 1,600,000 tons,  as against 2fmillion tons in 1913, for causes which were very well known to theCouncil.     At the moment tentative discussions were taking place invarious districts in this country with regard to the formation of district associations, and eventually perhaps a  national associationhaving powers ox control over prices and output,- but not a selling-agency.  However, negotiations were not yet sufficiently advanced tobe able to form a definite opinion as to their success or otherwise.    LORD GAIKFORD observed that the demand for blast furu3.ee eo&amp;e,was very much the same as it had been,  and there was no changewhatever in the price.  The demand for foundry coke  was also at themoment dull.  It had been rather difficult for blast furnaces toarrange contracts ahead on account of the differing  views taken bythe blast furnace owner and the coke vendor as to which was to getthe benefit of the relief in transport  rates as  from 1st December. Ithad finally been arranged to contract ahead and,  failing agreement inconnection with the price after 1st December, to  cancel the contractsaltogether.                        IROII AND STEEL.  &apos;    MR. BOND wrote:-    nThe increased activity on the Continent with consequent reducedexports to this market was reflected in the imports  of iron and steel in September which fell from 272,400 tons in August  to 184,500 tonsin September.  Of this decline of 87,900 tons, 38,400 tons were dueto. a drop in the imports of semi-xinished material which declined from 106,400 tons in August to 68,000 tons in September.  Unfortunate-ly,  no such improvement was registered  in exports which? in fact,declined from 369,800 tons in August to 295,100  tons in September.Continental producers have continued active during October,  and itis probable that- the import figures, when they appear,  will be nohigher than the September figures.   Exports,  on the  other hand,  willprobably show an increase since,  as  far as the Tees is concerned,the steel shipments  are the best  for any month since June,  duelargely to an expansion in exports  to India and South Africa.   Thedecline in imports of semi-finished material has  led to greateractivity in the case of British suppliers of this material  whosedelivery prices now  approach those  from Continental  works,  but therise in the price of this material  to the finishing  works has  reactedunfavourably on re-rollers since in most cases the rise in  the priceof finished material is not  sufficient  t-s compensate for the increasem the price of the  semi-finished product.
IRON AND ST SSL (CONTS).    &quot;So far as has been reported up to the present  four additionalfurnaces were blown in during October.  As far as Cleveland isconcerned,  output of pig iron is just about keeping pace withdemand,the  reduced demand for foundry and engineering works beingcounter-balanced by larger demands for the steel works,  and pricesremain firm.   On the North West  Coast the pig iron  output is ratherbetter, and it is anticipated that the stocks, which are fairlyheavy, may  be exhausted within the next few months.  In Scotlandmakers are  complaining of the lack of business due  partly to theslackness of  the iron foundries  and the quiet condition of the steel makers,  although on the other hand there has  been improvementin export demand.  Three of the  four furnaces which have resumedoperations  are,  however, in Scotland.    &quot;With regard to steel, as stated above, there is an increasing demand for  semi-finished steel and the increased price andrelative difficulty of obtaining foreign shipbuilding material isproving the usefulness of the Rebate Scheme  both to the steel makerand to the  shipbuilder,  for it has the result of ensuring to theshipbuilder his  supply of steel  ana of ensuring the steel maker alarger share  of  home orders than formerly.    &quot;On the whole it cannot be claimed that the situation is worse than it has  been for the last few months and? in many respects,  itis decidedly  better.  The most hopeful feature at the moment is thelabour difficulty in Germany,  which has led to the  closing down of the Ruhr iron and steel works.   For some time the workers havebeen pressing for increases in wages, maintaining that the increase which took  place at the beginning  of the year was quite inadequate.The dispute eventually went to arbitration and the  arbitratorawarded the workers about one-third of their demands.  This theworkers accepted, but the employers rejected the award,  and the works were  closed  down on November l3t.   The arbitrator  has declaredhis award binding,  but the employers claim that the award itself was illegal.   It is impossible to  say how long the  dispute maylast.   Apparently the men are not  to receive unemployment pay.which vail  tend  to  shorten the dispute,  but, on the other hand,the employers are credited with,  desiring to dispute the  wholequestion of arbitration and the  validity of arbitration awards.One report  states that the employers seem to be preparing for a stand-still of several weeks1  duration.    &quot;Generally such improvement  as  is noted is entirely  due tothe fa at that the Continental industry is fully occupied and isquoting very  long deliveries.  This  will be accentuated if theGerman lock-out  persists for any length of time,  but  the improve-ment in the British industry is  not due  to any fundamental improve-ment in the relative position.   In  fact  the Continental  works aremaking relatively much greater progress  and are extending their capacity to deal with the increasing demand which at  the moment hasslightly improved the British position.   The relative positionof the British iron, and steel  industry to its competitors is  stilldeclining.&quot;
e...1 *x M     ME. PUGH wroter-     &quot;?IG IRON:  At the commencement of the month thereports from the various districts showed a tendency toimprovement.  Four furnaces have been re-started in theWest of Scotland.   On the North East coast orders forprompt delivery necessitated the drawing from stocks.A peculiar factor about this trade is that although foreigncompetition can be said to be non-existent, yet blast furnace plant is operating far below capacity.     &quot;SEP. 1-FINISHED STEEL;  There is a further improvementin the demand for semi-finished Steel.  Continental manu-facturers of soft steel billets have practically withdrawnfrom the British market, having enough orders to keep themgoing without accepting commitments from this country.&apos;:Jelsh Sheet and Tinplate Bar Manufacturers are doing fairlywell with local orders, as prices are more in tone withContinental quotations.  Many firms have orders to occupythem until the end of the year.     &quot;TINPLATES;  The beginning of the month showed a slightimprovement, but new business is slow in coming in.  Laterreports show that the market is quieter and that demand has fallen off somewhat.  So far the agreement between the 7elshand American manufacturers has had very little effect onorders.  It has been agreed that a three weeks stoppage willtake place during the thirteen%weeks commencing 1st December&apos;,this includes the Christmas holiday.     &quot;GALVANISED SHEETS;   This section of the Industry isvorking satisfactorily, and an increased-volume of businesshas taken place during the month&quot;.     LORD GAINFORD reported that Cleveland pig iron had beenvery dull all the autumn, exports in October had been on a reduced scale, and there had been apathy and slackness inthe foundry and engineering trades.  There would probably beIncreaoed demand for Cleveland foundry iron if the threatenedtrouble in Germany came to a head.  Hematite pir iron stockshad been reduced, and supplies-might be required for delivery to the Continent as a result of the strike, if itmaterialized.  There was a jirospect of two more furnacesbeing put into blast early in next year, which was an encouraging featurq.     In connection with iron and steel, the constructionalworks vere still very busy in the north-eastern districts.The delivery dates promised for Continental steel showed that contracts were extending into next year, there wasIRON AND STEEL (CONTD.)..
                                       *1 If                                        ,1..                                       oC OffFI DE2ITIAL.LgOK AMD STEBL (COMiD),.rather less hand-to-hand selling, and the consequence had beenthat the price was hardening a little.  A recent quotation forforeign sections and joists to a constructional yard nearNewcastle had shown that Continental basic Bessemer steel couldbe bought at 19/66. per ton below the British price for open-hearth steel of average specification.  Of course,  that was avery serious difference, but it did not appear to take intoaccount the inferior quality of the foreign material, nor thenecessity for the home producer to have a stock of foreignmaterial on hand if he was going to produce foreign materialrather than home.                          STEEL.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR thought that October had been better inthe home trade.  Prices were lower, and this in the long runshould bring, more business. &quot;As regards the Overseas markets,it was difficult to do business with Russia without givingextended credit.  In Germany a change had taken place; we wereregaining customers  there for rasor blades-, and they were comingback to us on account of the superiority of our product in bothprice and quality.  France was quite hopeless as a market forSheffield.  In Spain a new tariff was being introduced  on filesand on steel, and it was difficult to get anything accurate as tothe situation there.  Canada was the most satisfactory marketat the present time and we were beating the Americans there.South America was good.  Australia was bad, especially in regardto special steel tools of every kind for engineering purposes *New Zealand was the next best  market after Canada.   If the orderscontinued to come in as they had during the last five weeks, theSheffield trades would do well in November and December,  althoughthe increase in exports in those months would not make up for the bad trade in the summer.     Trade with China was good, partly owing to dealers trying to get merchandise in before the new tariff came into operation.Sir Arthur was afraid people did not appreciate the. importanceof the Mukden district trade.   His own agents had been there forthe last seven weeks,  but no other Englishmen,  although therewere several agents of Continental and American firms.  Therewas a considerable trade to be done in this district in railwaymaterials, motors and heavy goods,  and more attention ought tobe paid to it.  With regard to trade marks in China,  the only wisething to do was to re-register the marks with the nationalist government,  especially as they had reduced the proposed charge and extended the period for re-regis tration until  the 18th April.Trade with Japan was slowly recovering and was  now  better than -at any time since the earthquake.  On the whole the situation was better,  with quite a hopeful trend.                    UOIT-FERROUS MLTALS.     SIR CECIL BULL said that the lead manufacturing industries,which had been very active for a long time,  were  now showing someslowing down both in cables and in general  work.  The copper  andbrass trades were very satisfactory at the  present  time,  they had got good orders for some while ahead. Tin  plates were  stillactive, and Cleveland iron was moderately well  employed,  but probably it was all on old orders,  and they were  wanting  new ones.On the whole the position was better than it had  been threemonths ago, but not quite so  good as one month ago.
ENGINEERING.     SIR ERNEST FETTER said that the trend of the Industry wasnot very satisfactory at the present time, but Btill in thesecond and third quarters of the year more headway had beenmade than in the first quarter.  There was no sign of the seasonal Improvement which was generally expected at this timeof year.  On the export side September was a poor month.The quantity of machinery exported, 40,500 tone, wae the lowest monthly total this year, and compared with 45/200 tonsin August.  The cumulative total for the first nine months ofthis year was, however, still considerably in advance of anyother post-war year.  Exports of engineering and alliedmetal products for the first nine months of this year were,In terms of relative volume, 19.1$ In excess of thecorresponding period of 1925, while the imports were 3.6$ inexcess.     As regards unemployment, the engineering Industry, asa whole, appeared to be just holding its own.  There had beena further Increase of unemployment in the marine engineeringbranch, and that followed the tendency in the shipbuilding industry, where operations had further declined.  this position was fairly clearly  brought out in the indexnumbers of production recently published which showed thatin 1927 our national industrial production represented anIncrease of 7.5$ as compared with 1924.  This Increase hadexpanded to 9.4$ for the March quarter of thie year, but inthe second quarter the index number fell to 103.5$ of the1924 level.     The statistics for 1927 published by the Cuetome wereInteresting as indicating the destination of engineering products.  In 1927 almost exactly one half of the tonnagewent to the British Empire, and one half to foreigncountries,     MR RICHMOND wrote       &quot;in Marine Engineering the tendency indicated lastmonth continues to be accentuated, and the preponderance ofvessels completed over new contracts makes the outlook forthe winter Bomewhat discouraging.  The artificial aocumulation,due to the coal stoppage of-1926, which was responsible forthe high output figures of the last two years, has now been worked off, and the industry is back to a dependence on theordinary run of trade.  The Clyde has been fortunate in securing the contract for the large C.P.S. Liner of 40,000tons, and there have been a few orders placed for theordinary Cargo vessel type, which appears to corroborateSir Alexander Kennedy&apos;s recently expressed belief that theprices of new tonnage are unlikely to oome below thepresent figures,  A sign of the times Is the drastic re-organisation of one of the largest shipbuilding yards and engineering establishments on the river, but the reeult islikely to be that, In view of the considerable surplus       :facilities already existing for both naval and merchantwork, an increased competitive factor will come in to analready overcrowded field.
ENGINEERING (GONTD.) .     &quot;In Sootland 18 vessels were launched in Octoberaggregating 20,459 tone, but the number and tonnage makeOctober the poorest for the year In respect of output.Enquiries continue numerous, a fair number of these beingfrom foreign sources.  On the North East Coast some orderBare being booked, and although the employment figures forthe distriot show a decline in September, the prospectivesituation is slightly better.  New methods In Whaling areresponsible for both orders and enquiries In this district.The most cheerful district seems to be the Mersey, wherethe immediate prospects are encouraging, new work and repairworfc having been booked in sufficient quantity to make theoutlook for the winter very satisfactory.     &quot;The unemployment figures for marine engineeringthroughout the oountry Indicate increasing generalslacknessj in September the percentage being 14.3 asagainBt 13.3 In August and 12.7 in September 1927&quot;.ELECTRICAL TRADES.     SIR PHILIP NASH wrote:-         &quot;As regards business In the electrical industry,there is not much change; If anything, export business hasslowed up, but home business Is no worse.                        COTTON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART stated that he was able to give a fairly good report of the general position in the cotton trade.  South America was exceptionally active, enquiryfrom India was good and a reasonable proportion of orders were getting into the books.  Egypt was showing a fairamount of activity.  The home trade was fairly normal.Australia was somewhat better, but not very aotive.  china was very slack Indeed. -There was considerable uncertainty and fear as to what the new Chinese oustoms duties would beand when they would come into force, and that wasupsetting the market.  While, however, a quick settlementthere would help the trader to know where he stood, therewas a danger in hurrying negotiations with the Oriental,- ifthe beet terms were to be obtained.     The position of the spinners was probably better atthe moment than it had been for a very long time and theimprovement was likely to be maintained.  This was duelargely to the opening up of the Indian market, and as aresult prices were better.
     MR LiiE wrote        &quot;My report, If I oould have made one verbally,would hardly have differed from the one I gave to theCouncil last month,  Business is certainly no worse.  Ishould judge that in the American section it is, if anythingbetter, although there is still a heavy percentage ofmachinery standing.  In the Egyptian section, the demand forthe past month has shown a considerable Improvement overthe earlier months of the year, and I should estimate thatthe orders for last month alike with those taken InSeptember have been suffioient generally to keep allmachinery in this section of the trade fully employed. Asa matter of fact Spinners tell me that they are stillincreasing stocks, but I believe that when the looms getfairly started again this will oease.  The margin of profitis unfortunately very small or non-existent.      &quot;There are no disquieting incidents at presentbetween labour and management.  Values of the raw materialare in the main reasonable, and prospects appear ratherbrighter than they did a few months ago.&quot;                            WOOL.     MR. AYKROYD wrote        &quot;Since tjhe Council meeting in October the position has changed very little indeed,        &quot;in the Merino Section there has been rather morebusiness, which comes through seasonal orders and has undoubtedly been helped by the fall In values which hasbeen going on for the past eight or nine weeks.  The delay in.shipping wool from Australia owing to the strike Islikely to have effect in keeping supplies back for running the combing machinery in this district during december and early January,  It will also influence the quantitiesoffered at the London Sales during these months, so we mustnot look for increased employment at any rate beforeFebruary as there will not be raw material available tobring this about,     &quot;The general conditions of trade are still very unsatisfactory, and there is not much sign of any permanentalteration until our economic basis is nearer to ourContinental competitors.  The only trades which are at allbusy are those making specialities.  Germany has boughtvery little In yarn for some time^ German buyers have beenwaiting for a lower basis of values, but the stoc-fca of yarnsuitable for export to Germany are still too large for usto expect much near business.&quot;COTTON (CONTD.).

MR ADDISON wrote:-       &quot;As regards the artificial silk market, there hasbeen no change of any importance since my report made atthe beginning of last month.  The conditions may be takentherefore as unaltered,&quot;C^MJCCALS.     MR, HILL mentioned that reports in the chemical trade generally showed a certain slackness at this time of theyear.  AB regards coal tar products, it might .be mentioned that pitch was in a bad position.  Intermediates and dyesshowed a Blight improvement, and enquiries, though not quiteas good as in previous years, were satisfactory as comparedwith the earlier months of this year..  In some sections ofthe fine chemical group business was quite good and therewas a growing preference amongst buyers in other parts ofthe world for the products of the British fine chemical industry.GAS INDUSTRY.     SIR 0. MILNE WATSON reported that the markets Inresiduals were depressed at the moment and  -showed no signsof recovery.  Prices were steadily falling and that ofpitch had fallen to a level which had not been seen since thewar.  The difficulty was that both in England and In Germany-pitch was accumulating in very large quantities.  A certainincrease in stocks of pitch was expected at this time ofthe year, because tar was riot being used on the roads, andtherefore the distillers were distilling their tar and soincreasing the quantities of pitch.  The pitch difficulty was really quite serious, and it was not certain whether ornot the bottom of the market had yet been touched.  Crosotewas in a similar position and had&quot; fallen about 25% in price since the beginning of the year.  There the difficulty was being accentuated by the fact that the Americans were now beginning to distil their own tar and produce cresote,where formerly they had been largely dependent upon thiscountry.  If some arrangement wero not come to, theposition would become serious both for the gas industry andthe coke oven industry in this country.  Benzol pricesremained much as they were and there was no movement in thecase of the subsidiary products.  The depression in thetrade in residuals might affect, later on, the pricecharged for gas.
GENERAL  TRADE.     LORD EBBISHAh observed that current indices of tradeactivity suggested that the autumn seasonal expansion oftrade this year had been, generally speaking, only verymoderate In amount, and in some cases very disappointing.  Thereports from the principal industrial districts were more encouraging than for some time past, but did not point to theexistence of any sustained inflow of orders.  No appreciablechange in the situation appeared likely before the close ofthe year.     !7ith regard to particular industries, in the coal trade difficulty had arisen in South Wales owing to failure to clear waggons.  There was no improvement in the past month in the position of the iron and steel *rade and reports from the consuming trades indicated few .poesibilities of anysubstantial increase in iron and steel consumption in theimmediate future.  Only in a very few special departments were there any 3igns of seasonal activity.  An increase wasnoticeable in the demand for iron ore, probably due topurchases for stocking purposes in anticipation of additionalblast furnaces being started later in the year.  In semi-finished steel, conditions had been rather more encouragingof late;  the decline in anthracite competition had had &quot;&quot;a beneficial effect upon this section, with the result that anumber of works reported full order books which would keep them well employed for some time to come.  In non-ferrous metals, tin prices had strengthened recently with the steady increase in consumption.  The lead market continued to bequiet, demand being on the slow side.  The copper marketreported greater activity, prices being the highest since 1925.In the woollen and worsted trades prices of raw wool showed a distinct hardening tendency during the past month.  in cotton a slight improvement in the demand for yarns and clothswas reported, but operations had been largely restricted by thefluctuations in the raw material prices.  The home and exportdemand for yarns had shown a slight improvement, specially incoarse American.  Enquiry for cotton cloth had been fairlygeneral and business was slowly expanding.  The slightimprovement in trade in piece goods in the Near East had been maintained, whilst an increased business had been done with south America.  Home trade demand showed little sign of expansion.  In the boot and shoe trade, whilst reportsindicated rather more business towards the end of the month,there had not been any marked advance; seasonal influenceswere beginning to have effect, but production was still&apos;restricted.  The export market continued to be quiet, though there was no sign of any falling off in trade with the UnitedStates of America, which for some time past had been a goodmarket.  The need for creating stocks for the Christmas trade had been reflected in an increase in activity in the potterytrade, especially in those sections-supplying fancy goods;otherwise there had been little or no change to report.  Inhardware and cutlery the seasonal trade had been by no meansas good this year as in former years since the war.  Thedemand in this country and in the Dominions and India forexpensive types of cutlery and plate had been increasing of late.  Greater activity was reported in the tool branches,with a steady increase in orders.
(U fc* i-General  TRADE (OONTD.).     In engineering and shipbuilding, the past month hadwitnessed a falling-off in the amount of tonnage under construction in shipyards and a further shrinkage of new orders.  Business in most engineering branches continuedspasmodic.  Constructional engineering appeared to be fairlywell supplied with orders, though not sufficient to maintainworks at full pressure.  Locomotive manufacturers hadreceived a number of good orders of late and the agriculturalengineering section remained satisfactory.  In engineering trades as a whole there had been a slight slowing up inactivity.  In the chemical industry conditions had beenquiet during October, though export business had been fairly satisfactory.     MR. MITCHELL stated that from Coventry it was reportedthat the motor trade was in a favourable condition, and therewas an appreciable reduction in unemployment in the town.  InHull there was an improved demand for oil and cakes; thepaint trade was about normal;  shipping and timber business was fairly satisfactory, but there was a fear thatcompetition from the sale of Russian timber would bring abouta fall in prices;  the demand for fruit was good, withslightly higher prices.  A report from Leicester stated thatsome improvement had occurred in the boot and shoeindustry;  manufacturers of hosiery were on the whole betteremployed;  in the woollen trade there was a feeling thata working basis had been reached with regard to merinowools, which reports from Australia tended to confirm;other classes of wool were still in an unsettled state, anda sound basis had not yet been established;  in hosiery,the dyeing and finishing branches, there was a decidedimprovement.   Liverpool reported the termination of theWest African pool which during the past seasons had been responsible for buying and marketing 50% of the cocoa crop.As a result, cocoa prices were approximately 3of* below thoseruling 12 months ago.  The fall in the market would operate against the spending power of the native cocoa farmers, andthis might be reflected in a reduction of imports into thecolony.  The export of palm oil and kernels from Sierra Leoneand Nigeria had been maintained.  A new Ordinance had been introduced in Nigeria under which most of the produce wasto be submitted for inspection by qualified officers, andthat had had a salutary effect.  The month of October had shown no improvement in the condition of the tanning trade.In the provision market there had been a tendency to a ratherlower range of prices.  Letterpress printing, photographicprinting and bookbinding were in a satisfactory condition.  Inhosiery at, Nottingham there was not the briskness in calling for further goods which was usually expected at this time ofthe year, due no doubt to the mildness of the weather, buttrade showed&apos;a slight improvement in the case of the Dominionsparticularly New Zealand and South Africa.  The requirements  &quot;of European markets were rather below the average.  For laceit had been a fairly good season;  the curtain trade wasnot in any sense depressed, but there was an absence ofbuoyancy, and ladies1 and children&apos;s light clothing waspassing through a quiet time.

Following recent weaknesses in new york, home sugar refiners reduced prices a few days ago and home grown beet factories also made varying reductions.  Atmonth end market closed quiet.  Price cutting by refiners,and still more severe cutting by home grown groups, seems toindicate a fight inside the British industry.  It is to beregretted if this is the result of the budget.  It seems likely that the stock of wheat in the United Kingdom willremain low throughout the winter.  It is very unusual forthis country to miss the opportunity of building up stockswhen wheat is plentiful in America, but the recent advancecaused buyers on this side to purchase less than usual.Marketing of Canadian continues in large volume, the quantitie:of new crop being good milling value.  Excellent prospectscontinue so far as Australian is concerned.  Germany is stilloffering wheat all round our coast.  This is difficult tounderstand, unless it is to make an exchange for economic reasons.  Irish bacon is plentiful, and at present prices is good value.

There is not much prospect of price-hardening to any extent until the very large weight ofcocoa 2ias been dispersed for sale -which had been held fromlast year by the combine.  Unless matters improve a littlein prices, it is very likely that the next trouble will arise with the farmers in West Africa, because it has been stated on many occasions that at 40/- they could only justmake a bare living.  A few years ago with prices cutdown, the farmers refused to offer the crops and an extensive crop was not picked or was wasted.

MR. MITCHELL reported that shipments of coal from scotland had improved somewhat, being at rather betterthough still unprofitable prices, but that the home trade had been very disappointing, due to the slacknessin general industry.  The total inland sale, accordingto certain estimates, showed a considerable reduction ascompared with last year.  In both iron works and steelworks less coal was being used.  Under the coalowners&apos;scheme a reduction in output had resulted, as comparedwith March, of about 50,000 to 60,000 tons per week, anda reduction of about 11,000 in the number of men employed.     The imports of pig iron into Scotland from theContinent had practically ceased, although in Septemberover 3,000 tons of pig iron had been imported from India,-probably from a purchase made some time ago.  Notwith-standing this, the output of pig iron was much less than last year.  The import of steel from the Continent hadbeen much less in September than in July or August orprevious months, but unfortunately this had not causedany increased trade for the steel works in Scotland.Great fluctuations had occurred in these imports, andit might be that large stocks were being held.  Theimport of tubes from Germany was continuing on a large scale.  One disquieting feature in the steel trade wasthat Belgium and Luxembourg were competing with usseriously in the sheet trade, which in the past had been fairly well held by this country.  The exports from belgium of galvanised sheets for the first seven months in 1928 as compared with 1927 showed an increase from16,600 tons to 30,700, and a large part of this increasehad gone to India.  it seemed clear that continentalmakers were endeavouring to turn their semi-finished steel into finished, and that our re-rollers might in
9 r.; r;zj kj CJconsequence have to pay higher prices for the semi-finishedmaterial, and have greater competition to face for the finished article.  The re-rollers were not, generally,taking advantage of the rebate scheme.

MR. PHILLIPS stated that the increase in the unemployment  totalon 1st October which he had had to report at the last meeting ofthe Council had continued.  In the week succeeding 1st Octoberthere had been a drop, but in the following three weeks theincrease had been resumed, and on 29th October the number was1,374,000 or nearly 40,000 more than on 1st October.   More than half of this increase had occurred in the North  astern division and this was largely due to increased short time working in yorkshire towards the end of the month.  Although details bytrades would net be available till later in the month,  he thoughtthat the increase had taken place largely in the coal trade.   Onthe other hand, the North Western division had improved sub-stantially during the month.  Wales had remained fairly steadywith a net increase during the month of 4,000 and in  scotland the numbers of unemployed had gone up 6,000.  In the  South ofEngland there was an increase of 15,000 which was a normal seasonaltrend.     Mr. Phillips handed in the following table of insured personsin employment,  which at the end of October showed a decrease  of40,000 as compared with the previous month.   He mentioned  that  theactual figures for the number of persons insured at the beginning
COED?! DENTIAL *9   OSiViPLOYMSNT (OONTD).of July had recently been calculated and were used in the table.This had caused some adjustment to be made in the other figures in the table from Jane onwards.     After taking out from the figures of insured persons lastyear, those outside the age limits of 16 to 64, the number ofinsured persons, aged 16 to 64, in July this year was between75,000 and 100,000 greater than the number in July last year.Comparing the position at the beginning of July this year withthat in July four years ago, the numbers of persons insured was555,000 greater, and, although there was an increase in unernploy-ment in insured trades of 205,000 there was at the same time anincrease in insured persons in employment ox 350,000.  a comparison of the number of insured persons in employment todaywith that at the corresponding date four years ago would show asimilar increase.

9 Z Qo  il/AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. SANDERSON recalled that in his recent reports he had referred to the dry conditions in Australia.  This was a very important and anxious time of the year, because without goodrains now the conditions in the summer were apt to be veryhard on all stocks.  Daring the last few days cables hadbeen coming in reporting fair to good rains in certain districts in the north, and it was quite possible that these might herald the monsoonal rains which were so anxiouslylooked for at this time of the year.     The arrivals of wool in store from 1st July to 30thSeptember amounted to 959,000 bales, of which 162,000 hadbeen sold, an3 3,000 shipped for sale overseas.  Thosefigures had since been increased, and although there hadbeen a check due to the strike of waterside workers., theloading of cargo had been proceeding,  A slight improvementhad occurred in the prices of wool at the auction sales.     With regard to the dairying industry, the weather conditions in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania were favourable and production was increasing.  In South Australiahowever, production showed a slight decline, and in NewSouth Wales and Queensland a slight increase.  Sugar condi-tions were generally good,  and crushing was proceedingsmoothly with satisfactory output of sugar.  The wheatharvest prospects had been improved by rains in October.     The imports into the Commonwealth during July and august were  24 millions, - a decline of  4* millionscompared with the same two months in the previous year,Exports were  16 millions,  which was  1 million below lastyear&apos;s figure.  Bank clearances in Sydney from 1st january to 22nd October amounted to  828! millions, which representedan increase of  11 millions over the corresponding amountlast year, and in Melbourne  611 millions, which was adecrease of  34f- millions.INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY thought that British trade was holding itsown In regard to Indian imports.   He had examined the ironand steel figures in particular,  and had found that beforethe war the British proportion of iron and steel imports into India was about 67l.  Subsequently it fell off, but now the British share of the imports  was up to 64$, which was practically the same figure a3 pre-war,,  Of t,he machineryimports, the British share was now 80% as compared with 90%pre-war.  A surprising change was tcJking place in cottonyarn imports into India as a result of the change in thetariff on imported cotton yarns.   The tariff rate was now so
CONFIDENTIAL.INDIAN TRADE (CONTD.).adjusted  as to give an adequate measure of protection to the coarser Bombay yarns, and the result was thatthe Japanese trade had been severely hit.  In the five months, April to August three years ago, Lancashirewas doing less than half of the total import trade.The cotton yarn imports were then 22 million lbs.weight, and were almost completely shared by Japan,with about 12 million lbs,, and Lancashire, with about10 million lbs.  Now the position was that the totalimports had been reduced to less than 15 million lbs.for the five months April to August of this year, but of this, Lancashire&apos;s share was &amp;k million lbs.,Japan&apos; s share only 2 million lbs., while China had acquired a share of 3i million lbs.  Thus three yearsago the trade was divided between England and Japan,with Japan predominating, and now the trade was divided between England, China and Japan, with Englanddoing more than China and Japan combined.  This was, hethought, a very satisfactory result of the recent changein the tariff in India, and, of course, in regard toiron and steel there had also been a tariff change verymuch in favour of the British manufacturer.     In regard to cotton piece goods there were signsof a continued change in Indian requirements as betweenthe classes of grey, white and coloured goods, and itappeared from that and from the fact that the finercounts of yarns were now required in India that theIndian taste was developing progressively in the direc-tion of finer goods.  This was, of course, all to thebenefit of this country.  In the white goods Lancashirewas holding her own with some difficulty, but still hada predominating share in the trade, while in thecoloured goods Lancashire also held her own.     In Calcutta the working week in the jute mills wouldbe increased to 60 hours per week from the first of Julynext year, and the effect of that would naturally be anincrease in the output and in the demand for raw jute.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE wrote&apos;     &quot;Provisional figures of the foreign trade ofArgentIna for the first  eight months of the current year show that imports amounted In value to $587,230,930(gold), and exporis to $739,, 651,991 (gold), as comparedwith respective totals of $538,178,310 and $718,189,231in the corresponding period of 1927.  The surplus of merchandise exports was thus $152,421,061, against$180,010,921* while imports of gold totalled $99,432,500,against only $6,557;871, there being no exports of the metal in either period.  Practically all the main linesof imports show increases in their total values thisyear, notwithstanding the fact that prices are about per cent, lower than in 1927,  the market for imported goods being increasingly competitive.  British exporters
                 SOUTH AMERICAN trade  (CONTD. ).to Argentina  - and this  applies equally to many of the latin american States - now have to face not only fierce competi-tion  from America, Germany, and other exporting countries,but also the  competition from local factories.  In Argentina,especially, wonderful strides have been made  in the domesticmanufacture of footwear, furniture, textiles,  knitted goods,glassware, paper, and many other  articles of  everyday use.It may be that this extreme competition ia the explanation of the fact that Argentina is one of the countries in whichthe percentage of excess of current wholesale  prices over those of the  last pre-war year is lowest.      &quot;With regard to Argentina&apos;s export trade  during the eight months  under review, advances occurred  in the values ofshipments of  hides, wool, cereals, and linseed, but therewere  small reductions in exports of meat, meat by-products,and In dairy  produce.  The total volume of outward shipmentswas less than in the first eight months of 1927 at 12,238,000tons, against 13,712,000 tons, the shrinkage being duechiefly to smaller shipments of maize.      &quot;Argentine business conditions during the past  monthhave been on  the whole quiet, but the chief consideration inregard to the commercial outlook is the prospect for the approaching crops of fine cereals.  Fortunately, the reportsrecently received in this respect have been optimistic.  Thetotal area sown is estimated to be 5 per cent, greater than last year, and good general rains have been experienced.  Inthe Northern  districts,  the crops ofwheat, linseed, and oatsare progressing well towards the ripening stage, whileelsewhere conditions are excellent.  Given a further rainfallbefore the harvest, there should be very satisfactory yields.Sowing of maize is proceeding satisfactorily,  and the early-sown grain is growing rapidly.  On 6th October last, a strikeoccurred of maritime workers at the Port of Buenos Aires, andthis adversely affected  the commercial situation there.Fortunately,  however, a  settlement was reached on the 29thof the month, and work was resumed.  The new Government took office on 12th October, and, should expectations be fulfilledby the adherence of the new Administration to a policy ofmaintaining the present  stable economic conditions undisturbed,a fresh period of commercial prosperity should be experienced.     &quot;Special interest attaches to the fact that a short-dated Argentine Government loan  of U,3, $12,000,000,  fallingdue in New York in September last, has been paid off toavoid the acceptance of a high rate of interest for itsrenewal.  It&quot;is understood that in connection with thisrepayment shipments of gold were arranged from Buenos  Airesto New York,  The weak tendency of the exchange a month agoalso encouraged other similar  movements of gold,  but  the total was small,  and it is satisfactory to observe  that a recoveryhas latterly  taken place in the exchange value of theArgentina peso to above the gold export point, so that,  withthe heavy crop movements due to commence shortly,  it  is reasonable  to assume that any  further efflux  of gold in thenear future has been obviated.
9 9                 SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.).      &quot;The Argentine Government has approved the new reducedscales of tariffs introduced by the Buenos Aires GreatSouthern Railway and Central Argentine Railway Companies.The new rates came into force at the commencement ofOctober, and It is estimated that they may result In areduction of six and seven million pesos (paper), respectively,in the gross receipts of the Companies for the current year.The Government has also approved the plans for the construc-tion  of the new Lacroze sub-way in Buenos Aires, and work inconnection therewith has been commenced.      &quot;The Argentine Government has promulgated the BudgetLaw corresponding to the 1929 financial year.  The ordinaryexpenditure Is calculated at a total of $704,131,453 (paper),the principal charge on the income of the Republic being thatin respect to the service on the Public Debt, estimated at$216,661,016 (papar) for the coming year.  Ordinary revenueis calculated at $705,000,000 (paper), the whole of this sumbeing derived from indirect taxation.  The largest source ofrevenue is the yield from the import duties, which is calculated at $325,100,000 (paper) for the year.  To meet expenditure for the construction of public works, authority isgiven for the issue of $158,000,000 (paper) of CreditoArgentina Interno Bonds.      &quot;With regard to Chile, the new scheme for the centraliza-tion  of sales of nitrate of soda and for the distribution ofthe fertiliser in the consuming markets Is operating success-fully.  There seems to be a slight improvement in general commercial conditions in the Republic, drafts being met morepunctually.  The volume of imports has Increased,, although there is still a tendency to restrict orders to thesenecessary to cover early requirements; in the Santiagodistrict trade would appear to be enjoying a more prosperousperiod than for some time.  In general, the tone of the markets Is firm, and the outlook is considered favourable.Rain, however, is needed to improve prospects for the crops,the average rainfall since the end of July having been below that  experienced in the corresponding period of previous years.      &quot;The Chilean Government has introduced into congress the estimates of the 1929 ordinary Budget,  placing theordinary revenue at 1,103,291&quot;,500 pesos, plus the estimatedsurplus from the 1.-9-28. accounts of 20,000,000 pesos, thusmaking the total estimate^ revenue.1,123,291,500 pesos.Expenditure in 1929 is estimated at 1,068,352,572 pesos.  Inconnection with the submission ef the estimates, the Ministerof Finance placed the expenditure ef; the extraordinaryBudget for 1929 at 225,000,000 pesos,  and the service charges on the loans which will be raised for this amount are estimated at 16,250,000 pesos.  The Minister added that, asthe estimated surplus on the 1929 ordinary accounts is55,000,000 pesos, there should be available at the end of1929  about 39,000,000 pesos (after deducting the 16,250,000pesos mentioned above) for reduction of taxation and theformation of an emergency fund for the service of theNational Debt.
     &quot;There is no change of importance to report in genereilcommercial conditions in Brazil,  trade in moat lines remain-ing very quiet.  The exchange value of the milreis continuesto be steadily maintained, but the requisite six months&apos;notice of the definite conversion of the currency on the basisof the proposed new parity has yet to be given by theauthorities, and there can be no doubt that the absence ofsuch official intimation must tend to retard a revival ofbusiness confidence.  Credit is not in ample supply; in fact,there appears little prospect of cheap money becoming......available in the early future.     &quot;Advices from the State of Sao Paulo refer to unfavourableclimatic conditions there, which have had the effect ofanimating the Rio de Janeiro coffee market.  The prospect ofthe crop being considerably smaller than had originally been estimated naturally tends to sustain prices.  There are as yet no indications  of an improvement in conditions in the localtextile industries, which continue to be affected by over-production, especially of the poorer grades which are meeting with increased competition from foreign sources.  Theimport markets in Rio de Janeiro are dull, although there hasrecently been some demand for heavy hardware manufactures.     &quot;On 24th October last, the Peruvian Government was successful in floating the second series of Q% ExternalSinking Fund Bonds, of which the first issue was  made inDecember, 1927.  On this occasion, a total of  2,000,000 Q%Sterling Bonds to Bearer, redeemable on 1st October, 1961,was offered in London at the price of 91 per cent., while,simultaneously, $25,000,000 of similar bonds were placed in new York, part, however, of this latter amount being reservedfor sale in Switzerland and Holland,  Both the London and new york issues were readily over-subscribed.  The proceeds ofthe issue are to be applied to the expenditure required tocomplete the retirement of certain outstanding external loans;in repaying certain short-term indebtedness; on the further development of the Harbour of Callao; and for capital expend!-ture for public works construction,     &quot;Conditions in the  market for Peruvian raw cotton havebeen affected by the reports of the  high yield anticipatedfrom the United States crop.  Plans are reported to be well advanced for the formation of a Peruvian Cotton Exchange, andit is understood that the Liverpool Cotton Exchange hasoffered to extend every facility towards its establishment,and will send experts to assist in the formation and operationof the new Institution,  A provisional Board of Directorshas been selected and a General Charter formulated which willbe submitted to the Government for final approval.   TheExchange Is expected to fix the price of Peruvian cottonaccording to the supply and demand in Lima, these prices beingreflected in Liverpool, New York, and other foreign exchanges.The scheme includes the establishment of bonded warehouseswhere supplies of cotton will be concentrated and held atCaliao for shipment abroad.     &quot;In regard to Colombian conditions, the Bogota coffeemarket has been somewhat Hull in tone, but the greater partof the crop from that district has already been sold atSOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD. ).

In Barranquilla,the commercial situation has been very quiet during the past three months, which, however, may be regarded as seasonal.Traders there report better sales to the Interior.  Surveysare being carried out for the construction of a railway fromBarranquilla to Cartagena.     &quot;Weather conditions in Guatemala have been all that could be desired to assist the coffee harvest.  In general,the tons of the latest advices regarding the crop arefavourable, and harvesting should now be In active progress.The commercial situation Is unfortunately affected by thefact that Guatemalan merchants are generally in an over-bought position, the volume of sales during September lasthaving been considerably below normal.  An improving tendencyhas characterised business conditions In Ecuador, although there is still considerable room for further recovery.     &quot;Remarkable headway continues to be made with thedevelopment of the vast natural oil resources existing inVenezuela.  The estimated production of petroleum in 1927amounted to 60,000,000 barrels, as compared with 36,926,000barrels in 1926, while it Is anticipated that the output during 1928 will exceed 100,000,000 barrels, which would place Venezuela second only to the United States of Americaamong the world&apos;s largest oil-producing countries.  prospects for the next coffee crop in the Republic continue favourable,and a satisfactory harvest may be considered assured.  Itis estimated that the yield will be about 1,000,000 to1,200,000 bags, which is an exceptionally high figure.Prospects for the cocoa crop also appear favourable.     &quot;In Nicaragua, the general elections were held on 4thinstant under&quot;the supervision of the United States ElectionBoard, and It Is understood that they  have passed offwithout the disturbances which have unfortunately accompaniedthem in the past,  conditions would therefore now appear tobe definitely favourable for an appreciable trade recovery.The crops in Nicaragua have recently benefited by an aabundant rainfall, and large yields of maize, rice, and sugar are anticipated.  The  -late commencement of the rainyseason, hov^ever, had an adverse affect on conditions in thecoffee plantations, and the harvest of that commodity isnot expected to exceed 200,000 bags, which, however, may beregarded as an average yield.
