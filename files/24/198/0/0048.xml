(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 899-B and 900-B.)      (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of 23dth Meeting, Minute (4).)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration-    (a.) An Annual  Review of  Imperial  Defence by  the  Chiefs of Staff  Sub-          Committee (OLD. Paper No. 900-B).    (&amp;.) Papers prepared for the use of the Chiefs of Staff  Sub-Committee irt          drawing up their Annual Review (OLD. Paper No. 899-B).    SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that the Review took the form of a comparison between policy and obligations on the one hand and defensive  resources on the other.This method had been adopted not in any critical spirit, but because it was thoughtadvisable to bring together  in one paper the various assumptions on which defence preparations were based, and the state of readiness of the various  measures whichhad been approved.  Having reviewed the situation, a list of items  was included inthe Report which, in the view of the Chiefs of Staff, required development gradually,and were therefore shown as of the first category of importance, and also a furtherlist of items which might be defined as falling in the second category Of importance.    ME. CHURCHILL considered the  Report, being a review  by the highestmilitary authorities available on the subject of Imperial Defence, was a document ofconsiderable importance, which had obviously  been prepared with the greatest  care.He did not wish to pass any comment on any of the details contained in this Report,but would confine his remarks to one general observation. He urged that,  havingregard to all the developments in the international sphere with the object of ensuringpeace between  nations, there was every reason to secure a  reduction in  the  total amount of the Service Estimates, and that, unless some such reduction was effected inthe Estimates for next year, there would be a feeling of disappointment among  largeclasses of the people  of this country.  In his view, the total sum for  all  three services  should not  exceed   110,000,000, which only  involved  a  reduction of 4^ million on  the present Estimates.    After the Ministers at  the head of the three Service Departments had entered acaveat regarding the difficulties of any large reduction of their estimates following the notable cuts of recent years     THE PRIME  MINISTER observed that, though, in his view, it was properfor the Chancellor  of the Exchequer to point out the need for a reduction in thetotal Estimates of the Fighting Services, yet a meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence was not the proper occasion for a discussion on this matter. He suggested,therefore, that the Committee should  approve the Report of  the  Chiefs  of  StaffSub-Committee, and that the consideration of the point raised by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should take place at the next  convenient meeting of the Cabinet.

                            CONCLUSIONS. THE COMMITTEE OE IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed  (i.) To approve the Review of Imperial Defence (1928) drawn up by the Chiefs      of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 900-B).(ii.) That  the Report and the  Minute thereon should be circulated to the      Cabinet.*          *          *           *           *          *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,    November 8, 1928.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the  Committee of Imperial Defence.  July  1928.SECRET.Copy  No.  62900-B.(Also Paper No. CCS. 165.)COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.IMPERIAL DEFENCE  POLICY.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 899-B.)A REVIEW OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE, 1928, BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.     AS the basis of our Review of Imperial Defence Policy, 1928, Papers have been prepared by the Foreign Office, Dominions Office, Colonial Office, India Office and Home Office.  In addition, a summary of the decisions affecting our work, taken by the Committee of Imperial Defence since the last Review, has been prepared by the Secretary, and the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial  Defence  have given us an Annual Review on the Defence  of Ports at Home and Abroad.  All  these documents have been circulated separately under C.I.D. Paper No. 899-B.     2.   In presenting our Annual Review of Imperial Defence for the year 1928, we do not propose to rediscuss the general principles set forth in our first Annual Review (C.I.D. Paper No. 701-B) which was recommended by the Committee of  Imperial Defence and  approved by the Cabinet of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in 1926 as a  general statement of Imperial Defence policy.  Neither the Memoranda which have been prepared by the Foreign Office and other Departments in connection with the present Review, nor  developments in the Fighting Services  themselves present any new factor of special importance.     3.   The scheme of the present Annual Review is rather  a comparison  of our policy and obligations with our  defensive  resources; a balance sheet, as it were, setting forth  both sides of the account.   If, in presenting our Report in this form, we find  it necessary to bring  to notice some  aspects of Imperial  Defence  in which our defensive resources fall short of our liabilities, this is done in no critical spirit.  We conceive it our duty to leave the Government under no illusions as to  the extent to which the Fighting Services are or are not  in a position to discharge the responsi- bilities which might devolve upon them in certain eventualities.    4.  Before setting forth in detail  the position of each Service in regard to this matter,  we think it will be convenient to  summarise the main principles governing the problem of Imperial Defence as set forth  at the outset of our first Annual Review.    5.  The  maintenance of sea communications is the first principle of  the system of Imperial Defence, and the major share of this  responsibility still rests with His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain. Apart from this, the chief principle is that,on the one hand, each of the several Dominions is responsible for its internal security . COMMITMENTS.[17766]B
and for protecting its territory and coastal trade against aggression until supportarrives from outsfde, while,  on the other hand,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  inGreat  Britain, in&apos; addition to  its duty  to defend  its own territory,  is mainly responsible  for      The security of the communications between the several parts of the Empire.     The provision of adequate defences in the non-self-governing Colonies and         Protectorates and  in those mandated  territories assigned to Great Britain         which are not in a position to defend themselves.     The protection of our interests in foreign countries generally and of our special         position in Egypt.     6.   On these principles the commitments devolving chiefly upon the armed forcesmaintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government  in Great Britain  are : -     The maintenance of our sea communications.  This commitment is mainly naval         supplemented by military and air forces in narrow  seas.     Assistance in the above by the provision of defences both at fuelling bases and         important points on the routes, and also in the  Colonies and Protectorates,         to  enable these to hold out until  relief arrives.  This is mainly a military         commitment supplemented by air  forces.     The maintenance of an Army and Royal Air Force expeditionary force.     The provision of the air defences  in Great Britain, from which source also has         to  be found the air striking force for any major war abroad.  This is an         air commitment in which the army assists by providing land  anti-aircraft         defences.     The fulfilment; ,so far as our resources and the situation allow of our treaty         commitments under the Locarno Treaty.     The provision and development of Imperial air communications and air ports.     The control of the mandated territories of Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan.     7.  These, briefly, are our  commitments, and since our first review  in 1926, two new factors  have been added :           (i.) The Soviet menace in Afghanistan.         (ii.) The upheaval in China.     The bearing of these on Imperial Defence policy is discussed later in this report.                         II. POLITICAL ASSUMPTIONS.    8.  Several decisions of a political character have been taken in recent years which govern and limit the extent of  our  defensive preparations, and which theCommittee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet ought to have in mind.    9.  First, there  is the principle stated by the Foreign Secretary as  recently asthe 8th February, 1928, in  the House of Commons, &quot;that preparations for a warwith the United States has never  been  and never will be the basis of our  policy inanything.&quot;    In order to remove all possible risk of misunderstanding on the subject, we wishit  to be clearly understood  that, although, in fixing the world  standards  of  navalpower, the numerical strength of  our capital ships  and aircraft carriers  is, underthe provisions of the Washington Treaty, laid down on the basis  of equality with thefleet of the United States, nevertheless, at the present time (as for many years past)we entirely  ignore  that  country  in  our  defensive  plans  and preparations.Should it ever be necessary to take the United States  of America  into  account inour strategical preparations, considerable developments and modifications  would benecessary in  our defensive arrangements, which would require  years to bring into effective  operation.   It  is  essential that  any  signs  of a  possible  change  inthe political  horizon vis-a-vis the United States of America should therefore  bebrought to notice  immediately,  and we suggest that the special  attention  of theForeign Office should be directed towards this possibility and its complications.    10.  A second political factor, which affects more particularly our preparations for the contingency of war  in the Far East, is  the decision of the Cabinet in 1925that &quot;in  existing circumstances aggressive  action against the British  Empire  on
the part of Japan within the next ten years  is not a contingency seriously to beapprehended.&quot;  (200th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence.)    11.  A third political factor,  which in this case affects our preparations for awar on the continent of Europe, is the following formula approved by the Cabineton the 28th July, 1927, as the basis of Army Estimates            &quot; That  it shall  be  assumed, for the  purpose of the Estimates, that the    British Empire will not be engaged in a European war  during the next ten    years,  and that the immediate plans of the Army should be based upon prepared-    ness-fbr an extra-European war.&quot;This decision accords with the following passage in our first Annual Review :          &quot; It follows that, as far as commitments on  the Continent are concerned,    the Services can only take note of them.  No specific provision to meet them is    practicable other  than the adoption of such measures of organisation, training    and equipment as are necessary to  enable  them  to fight on the Continent  if    required.&quot;    12.  In regard to Air Defence, it will be recalled that the Cabinet, at its Meetingheld on  the 3rd  December, 1925, approved  the recommendation &quot;that the  AirMinistry should base their estimates on the assumption that the completion of thescheme of Air expansion for Home Defence, approved by the Cabinet and announced in both Houses of Parliament on the 20th June, 1923, is to be postponed until theyear 1935-36.&quot;  (Cabinet 57 (25).)    13.  The state of our preparedness is also influenced by the opinion expressed to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in&apos;1925, and repeated as recently as the 5th July, 1928 (236th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence), that in present circumstances war with France is inconceivable.&apos;The following remarks of the Secretary  of State for  Foreign Affairs in regard toRussia, made  at the 236th Meeting, are also of importance :-         &quot; The one outstanding uncertainty was Russian policy.  Of late Russia had    been buying equipment and strengthening her army.   On the other hand, he    believed that the  Russian army  was at the  present  time incapable of offensive    operations on a large scale.  Nor did he think that the present rulers of Russia    wished to  precipitate  an  external crisis, but they had continually to face    immense  difficulties  internally, and one could never be certain what measures    a Government in  such a situation might take to divert attention from domestic    and internal affairs.....If, however, he&apos;was asked which was the country    which seemed most likely to- threaten the peace  of the world to-day, his answer    was Russia, which was the greatest danger spot.&quot;    14.  The political  assumptions referred to  above  were  supplemented  and expanded at the 236th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence by the followingresolution, which is to be reviewed annually by the Committee or at shorter intervalsat the request of the  Government of any Dominion or  of any Department of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Great  Britain :          &quot; That it -should be assumed, for the  purpose of framing  the Estimates of    the Fighting Services, that at  any given date there will be no major war for ten    years.&quot;    From a study of the Minutes of the 236th Meeting, and from our own recollectionof  the discussion, we gather that there is  no  intention  to  interpret  the  aboveresolution in any extreme or rigid form, and  that  each Department is entitled toexpress its own view in regard to the interpretation.    In this connection  we note that at the  236th Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence, Sir Austen Chamberlain said that while  &apos;&apos; the Foreign Office hadthe greatest responsibility in advising the Government with regard to  the decisionof what period of peace might be expected, and that no more expert opinion on sucha subject could be obtained anywhere, it would be impossible for the Foreign  Officeto gibe any guarantee in regard to the advice it gave.&quot;    The intention of the  Committee of Imperial Defence in adopting this resolution,we understand, is, so  long as existing international conditions prevail, to postpone       [17766]                                                      B 2
bringing our defensive arrangements (which as this Report shows are as a whole notat a high standard of preparedness) to that pitch of readiness for a major war whichwas aimed at in 1914 and the immediately preceding years.   There is, however, no intention to rule out those developments of Imperial Defence which are essential to security, nor to allow their postponement or retardation to be carried to a point atwhich, in the event of a deterioration in the international situation, it would either be physically impossible to overtake the accumulation of deficiencies within a reason-able time, or at which the mere attempt to do so would arouse suspicion and endangerpeace.  From the Minutes of the Meeting it is  clear to us that the resolution was accepted by others, as well as by  ourselves subject  to some such commentary as above.    It would  be premature to try and estimate  all the reactions on the Service.Estimates of the resolution quoted above.   One result, however,  on the priority ofexpenditure appears  to be that those schemes which,  Avhile essential  to  ImperialDefence, require many years for their completion, will have  to be pursued steadilyand methodically,  while other needs which could, in the event of  a change in theinternational situation, be completed  more rapidly, and without arousing inter-national suspicion, may have to take a lower place in the scale of priority.                             III. NAVAL POLICY.    15.  The  Admiralty&apos;s preparations for carrying  out its  share in  ImperialDefence  are governed generally  by the decisions  of policy referred to above,  aswell as by the Government policy which was formulated  at a Meeting of the Cabineton the 6th May, 1925 (Cabinet 24 (25), Conclusion 3).  Under this Cabinet decisiona one-Power standard of Naval  strength was  adopted, it being stated that &quot; therequirements of a one-Power standard would  be satisfied  if our  Fleet,  whereversituated, is equal to the Fleet of any other nation, wherever situated, provided thatarrangements are made from time to time in different parts of the world, according asthe international situation requires, to enable  the  local forces  to maintain  thesituation against vital and irreparable damage,  pending the arrival of the MainFleet, and to give the Main Fleet on arrival sufficient mobility.&quot;    16.  From the above, therefore, the Admiralty has been given the responsibilityfor maintaining a one-Power standard under the conditions set out in the cabinet decisions.  Since war with the United States is ruled out  (vide paragraph 9), thisprimarily involves making the necessary arrangements that  the Fleet, if sent  to eastern Waters, would, on arrival, have the facilities required for complete mobility.    17.  Strength of the Fleet.-The Naval Building Programme, approved by theCabinet and placed before Parliament in Command Paper 2476 of the 22nd July,1925,  was framed so as to give to the  Admiralty  their minimum requirements incruisers to meet Government policy.   Actually in this programme, as a measure of economy, the Admiralty accepted a new basis in regard to the lives of various classesof ships.  This in itself represented a considerable sacrifice which had to be made toreduce the construction programme and expenditure involved.    They also agreed to do without a number of  Fleet Auxiliary Vessels which are maintained by other naval Powers, such as destroyer depot ships, provision and storecarriers, although these are  necessary for the  full efficiency of the  Fleet and  the welfare of the personnel.   These vessels will have to be constructed if  the  inter-national situation becomes threatening, or extemporised  (by  taking up valuablemerchant ships) in the event of war.    The minimum number of cruisers we require is 70.   At the Geneva Conferencewe accepted that 10 of these should  be over 20 years of age.   This  allowance  for10  cruisers being over the age limit  again  involves a decrease  in Naval  strength,especially during the period up to 1940, during which  our oldest  cruisers will  be those  designed during the war, and for which a life of over 20 years is doubtful.    To provide the  cruiser requirements  an  average  programme  of  3 cruisersannually has to be maintained.  The recent reduction of 3 cruisers in the programmes for 1927 and 1928 means that the standard required Iry the Government policy is notat present being maintained.    As regards destroyers, we are at present building 9 a year.  This rate of building will leave us inferior to Japan in the number of destroyers under  16 years  of agebetween 1934 and 1938.
     18.   Mobility  of  the Fleet. For the mobility of the Fleet, as required byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, a reserve of oil fuel of 7 million tons is necessary.  Atthe present time the reserve stands at less than 4 million tons.   Owing to financialdifficulty  during the last 3 years, including the financial year 1928/29, it has beenpossible to add  only 100,000 tons of oil fuel annually to our reserve stocks insteadof the previous annual amount of 330,000 tons.   This has represented an annualsaving of  600,000 in  addition  to  the amount saved by the  decreased tankagerequired  to be erected.   If, however, the present rate of 100,000 tons annually is continued, the total reserve of oil fuel will in 1937 be only 4f million tons.   Increasedoil fuel reserves have to be prepared for by provision of storage tanks, which taketwo years to build.   It  is,  consequently, not  possible to speed up the  rate ofaccumulation of stocks at short  notice in a period of crisis, and therefore in thecreation of oil  fuel reserves  it is necessary to take a  relatively  long view.  The-extent to  which the arrangements for securing the mobility of the fleet are likely tobe affected by the possible  construction of a pipeline from Baghdad to  Haifa hasnot as yet been worked out in detail.     19.   Reserves  of Stores. Reserves of all  Naval stores  have  been reduceddrastically.   A small  amount is being  added to the reserves  yearly, but  at thepresent moment reserves may be said to be sufficient to meet only peace requirements.The small sums which are at present spent annually are in no way sufficient to meetfull requirements in 10 years&apos; time.  On the other hand, in certain respects it will beuneconomical to spend large sums in this direction.  As an instance of this, the reserves of aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm are at present maintained on a  peacebasis because the replacement of types of aircraft taking place renders unjustifiablethe  provision of full war reserves of  existing types unless the situation actuallydemands  it.  The transport  and distribution of all stores will require  the use ofspecial ships, but in this direction also it is economical and desirable to postpone all expenditure until  the  situation  becomes more threatening than at the  presentmoment.     20.   Singapore.-^-Developments of the Naval Base (as distinct from the defences,which are referred to in Section IV) at Singapore are proceeding on the lines of whatis known  as the &quot; Truncated Scheme &quot; approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Thedeferred  portions of  the whole scheme will have to be proceeded with,  should  theinternational situation become less peaceful than it is at the present time.   Owingto the financial limitations, the &quot;Truncated Scheme&quot; itself will not be completed before 1937.     21.   Summary. To sum up, the Naval position with regard to the maintenanceof the one-Power standard as defined is : (a.) Strength of the Fleet.    Numerically the  required standard will  be attainable in 1938, providedthat the 1925 Building Programme is continued undiminished after 1928, andthat Capital Ship replacement is taken in hand in accordance with agreements,but the numbers are obtained only by retaining Cruisers and  Destroyers  in service beyond the periods for which they can safely be considered as reasonablyefficient.(b.) Mobility of the Fleet.    (i.) War  Reserves  of  Oil  Fuel  for  the  Fleet  are  at  present  farbelow the amount calculated as necessary, and the present rate of accumulationwill not produce the total required within the next 30 years.    (ii.) Preparation  of a. Naval Base for operating in the Far  East is inarrears, and the Singapore Truncated Scheme will not be completed until 1937.    (iii.) Reserves of Stores is an item  which in  certain respects  can-noteconomically be fully prepared long in advance, and, provided that expenditurecan be faced when the situation calls for immediate provision of reserves, thepresent policy is adequate and economical.    (iv.)  The defence  of ports generally,  and especially of those which may beused by the fleet in time of war, is not satisfactory, and to this we will now turnour attention.
     18.  Mobility  of  the Fleet. For the mobility of the Fleet,  as required byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, a reserve of oil fuel of 7 million tons is necessary.   Atthe present time the reserve stands at less than 4 million tons.   Owing to financialdifficulty during the last  3 years, including the financial year 1928/29, it has beenpossible to add only 100,000&apos; tons of oil fuel annually to our  reserve stocks insteadof the previous annual amount of 330,000 tons.  This has represented an  annualsaving of   600,000 in addition  to  the amount  saved by the  decreased tankagerequired to be erected.   If, however, the present rate of 100,000 tons annually is continued,  the total reserve of oil fuel will in 1937 be only 4f million tons.  Increasedoil  fuel reserves have to be prepared for by provision of storage tanks, which taketwo years  to build.   It  is,  consequently, not possible to speed up the rate ofaccumulation of stocks at short  notice in a period of crisis, and therefore in thecreation  of oil fuel reserves  it is necessary to take a  relatively long view.  Theextent to which the arrangements for securing  the mobility of the fleet are likely tobe affected by the possible  construction of  a pipeline from Baghdad  to Haifa hasnot as yet been worked out in detail.     19.  Reserves  of  Stores. Reserves of all Naval stores  have  been reduceddrastically.   A small amount is being  added to the reserves yearly, but  at thepresent moment reserves may be said to be sufficient to meet only peace  requirements.The small sums which are at present spent annually are in no way sufficient to meetfull requirements in 10 years&apos;  time. On the other hand, in certain respects it will beuneconomical to spend  large  sums in this  direction.

Singapore. Developments of the Naval Base (as distinct from the defences,which are referred to in Section IV) at Singapore are proceeding on the lines of whatis known as the &quot; Truncated Scheme &apos;&apos; approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Thedeferred portions of the  whole scheme will have  to be  proceeded with, should theinternational situation become less peaceful than it  is at the present time.   Owingto the financial limitations, the &quot;Truncated Scheme&quot; itself  will not be completed before 1937.     21.  Summary. To  sum up, the Naval position with regard to the maintenanceof the one-Power standard as defined is :      (a.)  Strength of the Fleet.        Numerically the required standard will be attainable in  1938,  provided     that the 1925 Building Programme is continued undiminished after 1928, and     that Capital Ship replacement is taken in  hand in accordance with agreements,     but the numbers are obtained only by retaining  Cruisers and  Destroyers in    service beyond the periods for which they can  safely be considered  as reasonably    efficient.     (b.) Mobility of the Fleet.         (i.) War  Reserves  of  Oil  Fuel for  the  Fleet  are  at   present  far    below  the amount calculated  as necessary,  and the present rate of  accumulation    will not produce the total required within  the next 30 years.         (ii.)  Preparation of a Naval Base for operating in the Far East is in    arrears, and the Singapore Truncated Scheme will not be completed until 1937.         (iii.) Reserves of  Stores is  an  item which  in certain  respects  cannot     economically be fully prepared long in advance,  and, provided that expenditure     can be faced when the situation calls for  immediate provision of reserves, the    present policy is adequate and economical.         (iv.)  The defence of ports generally, and especially of those which may be     used by the fleet in time of war, is not satisfactory, and to this we will now turn    our attention.
                            IV. COAST DEFENCES.     22.   In no sphere of Imperial Defence policy has our state  of preparednessbeen retarded more by the political decisions referred to in section II than in thatof  Coast  Defence.   Shortly after  the war the principles governing coast defence policy, forms of attack and forms of.defence, &amp;c, were reviewed, and these principleshave recently been revised and brought up to date.  The review of principles was followed by a detailed study of their application to the defence of each port, andrecommendations were made for  bringing  the defences up to date.   At the requestof the Governments concerned this comprehensive review was extended  to embracethe  coast defences of the Dominions, and the enquiry is now complete  except forcertain ports at home and in the Mediterranean, in West Africa,  Canada and theWest Indies, in regard to which enquiries are either already in hand or will shortly be commenced.   The net result  is that  paper plans have been drawn  up for the revision of coast  defences,  Economies resulting from these enquiries have alreadybeen realised, but the defects brought to light have not been made good.  In our-present review we have taken into consideration only those methods of coast defence which have hitherto been accepted, and have not taken into account any developments in coast defence warfare which might be  brought  about by greater use  of the air arm, a subject in which sufficient experience  is not yet available to  enable  us toexpress a unanimous opinion.     23.  Defence of Singapore. The position at the present time is that Singaporeis the  only port at which progress is being made in regard to  the coast defences.According to our present policy, the first stage of the Singapore defences, which hasalready been begun and which includes the emplacement, inter alia, of three 15-inch guns, will be completed by March 1933.   Before the second stage is commenced, thefinal nature and extent of the defences is to be reviewed in the light of technicaldevelopments during the intervening period, but the final scheme of defence is to becompleted by 1937.       ,/ -                                 -     24.  The air base at Singapore has been approved and the constructional workon this has progressed favourably. Already an  &quot;L&quot; shaped landing ground suitablefor use by light aircraft, is available.   Barrack accommodation for the care andmaintenance party  will  shortly be completed  and the slipway, jetty and technicalbuildings are in process  of construction.   The work involved  in the provision of a properly prepared aerodrome suitable for all types and of technical accommodation for the care.and maintenance party should  be  completed by  1932/33  and  thecompletion of the air base effected by 1937.  No specific  provision, however, has yetbeen made for air units for the defence.     25.  Defences of other Ports. In the case of all other ports, however, requiredfor the use of the fleet, little or nothing has been done to bring the defences up todate to meet the scale  of attack to which they may be subjected.   The defences ofthe principal home ports have been reviewed and recommendations made, but financial considerations preclude anything  being done at present.  Berehaven is inadequatelydefended for use as a Naval Base.  As regards Atlantic Ports overseas,  owing to thenecessity for economy, the Committee of Imperial Defence have had  to agree (subjectto review annually)  to reductions of the defences of Sierra Leone to a care andmaintenance basis, Bermuda has also been reduced, and our position in the Atlanticis, therefore, weakened,  there  being no  port, with  the  exception of Gibraltar,  atwhich  a regular garrison of any  adequate strength is  maintained.  In a european war this  will increase the difficulties of trade protection.     26.  Defended  ports have been classified A,  B and C  according  to  theirstrategical importance.  From the Naval point of view  it  was desirable that ports in category &quot; C &quot; should be permanently defended, but it was agreed that this was notfinancially practicable, and that the risk entailed by the absence of defences in theearly stages of a war must be accepted.  The  present  financial stringency  makes it-impossible to  make provision in  peace for either armaments  or personnel for thedefence of category &quot; C &quot; ports.  All that can be done is to make out the necessarydefence schemes and to keep ?n view the necessity which will arise  on the outbreakof war.
    27.  In  regard to the  local Naval defences of principal  ports, the  situation,so far as stores are concerned, is satisfactory.    A considerable portion of thesedefences, however, is still in the experimental stage.    28.  In regard to  Air Defences at defended ports abroad (other than Singapore)the present position is that, except at Aden (responsibility for the defence of whichhas been transferred to the Air Ministry) where a,squadron is at present  located,little  has so  far been  done with  regard to  air  defence.  Arrangements  are  beingmade to provide a certain number  of anti-aircraft guns at Hong Kong, and,  in viewof the recent Cabinet  deoi&apos;sion* approving the establishment of an Air Base, it willbe possible for the Air Ministry to locate Air Units there when required.   The air defence requirements for  Malta and Gibraltar are still under consideration, and atpresent no provision has been made.  It may be  observed that since the first annual review of Imperial Defence the Committee  of Imperial Defence has considered itnecessary to allot a higher order of priority to these bases in our programme for the installation of anti-aircraft armament.    29.  There is a large number of defended  ports and bases both at home and overseas  which have no aerodrome in  their vicinity : The provision of  aircraft forair defence at defended ports at home and overseas  is still the subject of examinationbetween the Service Departments,  and policy in this respect is not as yet determined.It is certain, however,  that the provision of air facilities for the operation of  aircraft in the vicinity of these ports is necessary.    30.  In addition  to the above, the defences  of ports in the Dominions  are outof date, t and there also, partly in  consequence of the favourable international situa-tion,  and partly owing to uncertainty  as to whether the existing  methods of coast defence may not be modified in the near future, we understand that no steps arebeing taken to carry out the recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    31.  If the political situation were to show  signs of a possible change it wouldbecome necessary  to   remedy  the  above  position,  the  present  very slow  rate  of progress would  have  to be  expedited  and some of the following1 steps  would  benecessary  according   to  the  nation  or   nations with  which  relations  weredeteriorating:             By His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.(a.) To speed up the completion  of  the defences of Singapore (vide para-       graph 23).(&amp;.) To reorganise the fixed defences of Hong Kong on lines recently accepted       by  the Committee of  Imperial Defence  as not  inconsistent with the       Washington Treaty;  to strengthen the garrison and provide one or more       Air Force  units.(e.) To complete  the defences of other ports East of Suez at a cost of over        1,200,000 (part  of  which,  however,  would  fall   on   the  Indian       Government).(d.) To bring up  to date the coastal, air and anti-aircraft defences of Gibraltar       and Malta,  including  the  requisite  local naval  defences  and  coastal       reconnaissance aircraft. The details have not yet been fully worked out,       but the cost would be considerable.(e.) To bring up to date the coast defences of the home ports in accordance with       plans  already approved or in an advanced  state.   The approximate cost       of the plans for fixed defences already approved is  1,282,800, and a few-       ports still  remain.   Also to  supply the - anti-aircraft  defences for  these       ports,  which are now under consideration.(/.) To bring up  to date the defences of ports in the North and South Atlantic       and in the West Indies, plans for which have not yet been taken in hand.(g.) To provide the necessary aerodromes and to complete  the air and  anti-       aircraft defences at defended ports.(h.) To complete  the provision at defended ports of the necessary air units for       the duty of coastal  reconnaissance.                       * Cabinet 31  (28), Conclusion 5.                 f Vide C.I.D.

On a review of the world situation and in the light of the statement given.to us by the Foreign Office, we do not recommend any change of the present policy in.regard to coast defence.   On our advice Singapore  has already been placed first in.the order of  priority for  expenditure on Imperial  Defence.  In view of the great-cost of the Singapore base, and bearing in mind the importance of not weakeningour mobile forces by locking up too large a proportion of our resources in a sedentaryform of  defence, we see  no  alternative  but to  take some risks in coast defences-elsewhere.  By the preparation of plans of defence for the different ports, somethinghas been done to shorten the time which- would be required to remedy the situationif a change in the international situation should render this necessary.   The post-ponement in carrying these plans into effect, besides achieving economy, will enable us to take advantage of any developments (for example, in  the air)  in coast defencewarfare, on some aspects of which there is at present  a difference of technical opinion.However this difference may be ultimately resolved, there is  no doubt that aerodromefacilities will be required in the vicinity of Defended Ports, and  we regard withmisgiving the present  situation, which only provides such -facilities at one or twoports like Hong  Kong  and  Singapore.   Hence,  while  we  cannot  view withcomplacency a situation in which our coast  defences and garrisons reveal so manydefects, and which might impair the mobility of the  fleet in time of war, we  areunable to recommend a change in policy so long as the Committee of Imperial Defenceadheres to the governing assumptions regarding the international situation referredto above in Section II of this Report.                             V. MILITARY  POLICY.     33.  The policy defined in the 1926 review of Imperial Defence referred to atthe outset of this report was, as it  always has been, purely  defensive, and  the liabilities imposed on the Army for its &quot;enforcement  can be summarised as under :      (a.) To assist in the maintenance of our sea communications by the provision           of garrisons at important points along our sea routes, and especially along           that route which leads from the  United Kingdom to the Pacific via  the           Mediterranean and the Suez Canal.     (b.) To provide for the land defence of  those parts of  the Empire overseas  for           whose defence  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is primarily           responsible.     (c.) To organise in the United Kingdom on a Territorial basis the units required           for coast and anti-aircraft ground defences.     (d.)  From the balance of the troops at Home, both Regular and Territorial, to           organize an Expeditionary Force  as our initial  contribution to meet  our&apos;           commitments in Europe  or elsewhere overseas.     At the time when this Review was written our military commitments could be-stated only in very general terms. The Foreign Office memorandum on which it was based (C.I.D. Paper No. 700-B) indicated that there was little reason to anticipate the  necessity for military intervention anywhere,  unless it were  to liquidate  the somewhat indefinite liability  assumed under the  Treaty  of Locarno.   The mostdefinite conclusion, therefore, which was reached by the Chiefs of Staff  Review was-the  immediate  necessity for  providing, and undertaking the defence of, the newSingapore Naval Base.  As  already mentioned, this was  placed first  in  order ofimportance as an Imperial necessity, and in  the second category  of  importance were included the defence of Hong. Kong as well as of the trade routes  leading from GreatBritain to Singapore.     An examination of the means then existing to  meet the demands of our policyshowed that there were certain grave defects.  The vital  cord in our imperial communications was weak, the garrisons, along it had  been greatly  reduced, coastal
Iarmaments were out of date, and anti-aircraft armament non-existent.  Owing to    the developments in military science, money was urgently needed in order properly    to re-equip and to organize the Regular Army, to fulfil- its correct role in Imperial    Defence of providing garrisons abroad and an Imperial Mobile Reserve at Home.        Subsequent events and the further consideration of certain  defence questions    have reduced the problems facing the Army to more definite terms; it is therefore    necessary to pass on to the Chiefs of Staff Review of 1927 before making any attempt    to equate our assets to our liabilities.        34.   Recent Developments affecting Imperial Defence Policy. In presentinga   their Annual Review for 1927 (OLD. Papers Nos. 811-B and 831-B) the Chiefs of    Staff drew attention to two new factors of major  importance  which  affected  our    Imperial Defence Policy, viz.                   (a.) The increased interest taken by  Soviet Russia  in Afghanistan.                (b.) The upheaval in China.       In addition they asked a specific  question regarding the  situation in Egypt    which, since then, has become somewhat acute.       As regards (a), the special Sub-Committee  which sat  all last summer under the    Presidency of Lord Birkenhead considering the  question of Russian penetration into    Afghanistan, has submitted its report (OLD. Paper No. 158-D), and its approval    by the  Cabinet (OLD. Paper No.  165-D) introduces  a development  of  the first    importance, namely,  the acceptance by the  Government  of a policy to maintain the    integrity of a friendly Afghanistan.       As regards (b),  the despatch to  China of  considerable military forces during    the. first half of 1927 had also affected  our  military policy to such an extent as to    make it necessary to ask for an  estimate of the period for which these abnormal    garrisons were  likely to be required in China.   The Committee of Imperial Defence    ruled that it might be necessary to  retain increased British forces in China, even    until the 31st March, 1929.  Meanwhile, a large reduction of these forces has already    been effected;  the situation, nevertheless, remains indefinite,  and there seems to be-    no doubt that a permanent increase of the British garrisons in China is unavoidable.    It should be noted that the need for reinforcing our troops in China came somewhat.    in the nature of a surprise,  a circumstance  which adds strength to the desirability    of instituting  and maintaining a good  Intelligence Service in the Far  East.       The recent breakdown of the treaty negotiations with Egypt has removed,  for   the time being  at any rate,  such small prospect as there was of our relations with    that country being placed upon a more  solid  f&amp;undation of  friendship.  It is  too    early  to  say whether the situation will  deteriorate  sufficiently  to  increase  the    likelihood of military intervention becoming necessary, but the  happenings of  the   past twelve months and the recent utterances of the Egyptian Prime Minister  are   a reminder as to the necessity for keeping in the Mediterranean a military reserve-    adequate to meet any more acute situation that may arise in Egypt.       Although it may be due to different causes, there is, in addition, to be considered   the possibility  of trouble arising in the Sudan.  Geographically, the  problem  of&quot;   reinforcing the Sudan may be regarded  as the same as that of reinforcing Egypt.       ,35.  Military Commitments in relation to Policy. Bearing in mind that  the-   self-governing Dominions have accepted the responsibility for their own military   defence until such time as reinforcements can reach them from other  parts of  the   Empire, and that India with the help of its British garrison is similarly responsible   for her own defence,  the following  may be summarised as  the more  important.   commitments of the British Army to-day :        (a.)  To provide adequate garrisons and defences for our defended ports  abroad,,             and  in particular those required  for Singapore, Hong Kong, Malta and.             Gibraltar.       (5.)  To provide the British forces necessary for the normal  garrison of India..       (c.) To provide adequate local security for those parts of the Empire overseas             for  whose  defence  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in  Great  Britain   is             primarily responsible  and for our other interests abroad, overseas, and             especially for  Egypt, the  Sudan and  China, for which reinforcements             must be readily available.       id.) From the balance of the troops  at home, both Regular and Territorial, to             organise an Expeditionary Force as  our initial contribution to meet our             commitments in  Europe or elsewhere overseas.         [17766]                                                         C
     (e.) To provide the anti-aircraft defences of Great Britain.     (/.) To provide the necessary defences and garrisons for the defended Ports ih            Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in the Irish Free State, and in            particular those  defences  and  garrisons  required  for  Sheerness,            Portsmouth, Plymouth and the South Irish Coast Defences.     (g.) To provide an adequate force for  the internal  security of Great Britain            and North Ireland.   .     36.  Examination of our Military Forces in relation to their Commitments.  In considering the military forces available to meet these commitments  it must be remembered that, as regards the infantry of  the line, not more than half  of our 126 battalions can serve overseas  at  the  same  time unless  some modification of the Cardwell system is  accepted.  The shifting  of  the strategic centre of gravity east- wards must necessarily involve some redistribution of our reserves.  This must, for both financial and administrative reasons,  be  carried out with the least possible dislocation to the principle of maintaining a balance between the number of  units serving in Great  Britain and those stationed  overseas.     It will be convenient first to consider the strengths of our oversea  garrisons in relation to their  duties by  geographical areas.   The subject is dealt with in  some detail in C.I.D. Paper No. 847-B, of which the following is a partial summary.  For the sake of brevity, garrisions will be discussed in terms of infantry battalions only.     37.   Mediterranean and  Near East. /The Mediterranean and the Near  East, excluding  Aden,  absorb 13  battalions, of which 3 are temporarily stationed in the Far East.  The 6 battalions in Egypt and the 2 battalions in the Sudan may be taken as being tied down to the internal security of those countries and not available for furnishing reinforcements  for other localities.   The present situation in Egypt, the possibility of a Mahdist rising in the  Sudan (remote though it be at the moment), the recent trouble in Nejd, with its threat of danger both to Palestine and to  Iraq, all point to the necessity for maintaining in  the Mediterranean an adequate reserve which is capable  of  being despatched rapidly to any threatened point in this  area. It is calculated that one infantry brigade should suffice for such a contingency, and this cannot, even were the complete garrisons  present, be  made available without entirely denuding either Gibraltar or Malta of its infantry garrison. The addition of 1 battalion to  the normal Malta garrison  would enable the necessary brigade of4 battalions to be found from the  Mediterranean, and yet leave 1 battalion each at that place and at Gibraltar.     Our  Mediterranean and Neap East  requirements,  therefore,  amount to  14battalions. ^   38.   The Far East. At the end of 1926 we had 4 infantry battalions in theFar  East, viz., 1  at Singapore, 2 (of which 1 was Indian) at Hong Kong, and 1 at tientsin.   Events in China  at the beginning of 1927 caused us  to  send outreinforcements amounting  to over a division in strength, and, though  these forces have been materially reduced,  the situation even to-day necessitates the  retention of abnormal forces in that country.  The British garrison at present contains 1 indian and  9 British battalions,  of which 1 is a  Guards battalion.  It has recently  been recommended that this garrison should be further reduced by 1 line and  1 Guardsbattalion.                                                  &apos;     The time must soon come when we shall have.to determine the future minimumstrengths of our garrisons in the Far East, and, in considering this problem, we  must bear in mind that the Government have accepted the policy that, as far as our resources  allow,  we  must  be  strong enough  to deter Japan  from attacking us(C.I.D. Paper 701-B).  We  have therefore before us the  dual problem of  safe-guarding our interests in China and of making our Naval  bases in the  Far  Eastsecure against the (at present unlikely) danger of attack  by  Japan.   With theinitiative in her hands at the outset, Japan might attempt the capture of Hong Kongor Singapore,  or  of both.    It is unnecessary here to  recapitulate the measures necessary for the gun defence of Singapore,  a decision on which has already  beenreached, though we accept the view of the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff thatthe existing infantry garrison of 1 battalion is inadequate and should  be doubled;but recent  investigations have shown that the defence of Hong Kong is by no meansassured, either by her armament or by her existing garrison.   The capture of HongKong would deprive us of a Naval base, the  loss of which might well result in the impossibility of our obtaining a decisive result in  any subsequent operations we might wish to undertake.
     The situation in China still necessitates the retention of forces in that country that should prove sufficient to deter Japan from attacking us.  We cannot, however, rely on internal unrest in China  to provide indefinitely  a  situation which will warrant the continued maintenance of such forces.  The solution to both problems appears to lie in maintaining at Hong Kong, and  possibly at Tientsin, a reserve of infantry which will be adequate to deal with any future emergency comparable to that which  faced  us  in  January  1927,  and will be strong enough to provide a sufficient deterrent to an attack on Hong Kong by such Japanese forces as are likely to be employed against such an objective.     In the opinion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,  in which we concur, therefore, we should maintain at Hong Kong a minimum of  4 battalions, of which 1 would be the existing Indian battalion,  and at  Tientsin we should have 2 British battalions.   This force represents an increase of  3  British battalions over and above the  1926 garrisons of these places, and it should be possible to produce from these increased resources a  brigade of 4 battalions which would be  available  to send to Shanghai or elsewhere in any emergency  that imperils the lives and property of our fellow  nationals in China.  The doubling of the present garrison of Hong Kong which this would entail would provide a material deterrent against attack by Japan.     Our Far Eastern requirements would, on the above premises, amount to 1 Indian and 7 British battalions; of the latter,  2 would be stationed  at  Singapore  and 5 in China.     39.  India. The quota of British troops required for the Army in India totals 5 cavalry regiments, 62 batteries of various types, 45 battalions and 8 armoured car units.   These numbers are  not susceptible  of reduction in view  of  the increased likelihood of war with Russia in Afghanistan.     40.  West Indies. The garrison consists  of 1 battalion  which  is considered sufficient, so long as the situation vis-a-vis America remains the same.     41.   In the above review of our overseas garrisons Aden has not been included, as it has been decided that as a result of the transfer of the responsibility for the defence  of Aden  to the  Air Ministry the  British battalion there quartered  will shortly be withdrawn.   If, however, the recommendations of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff as to the increases necessary in the Mediterranean  and the Far East are  accepted, it will be seen that, ofUour  126 line battalions, 67, or more  than half, will be permanently stationed outside the British Isles.     42.   The  Regidar Expeditionary Force. The  Regular Expeditionary Force, which is the residue of the total regular British Army after deducting the  above foreign garrisons,  amounts  to the equivalent of  approximately 5  divisions.  Even when 10 Guards battalions are added to the 59 line battalions which will, under the proposals of  the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, be available in the British Isles and on the Rhine, it will be seen that the  margin of regular infantry remaining over and above the 60 battalions required for our 5 divisions cannot be regarded as a  safe one, when one takes  into  consideration the possible demands for home defence, internal security, the protection of lines of communication in  the theatre of war,  and perhaps for reinforcement of overseas garrisons.     Apart from a somewhat indefinite liability imposed by the Treaty of Locarno, our  main military problem  appears  to  lie  in the danger of  war against Russia in the defence of the integrity of Afghanistan.    The conditions under which the Expeditionary Force would take the field in such a war have been worked out, and a rate  of  mobilization is under consideration  which  is appreciably slower  than that given in paragraph 19 of the&quot; 1926 Review of  Imperial Defence Policy (C.I.D. Paper 701-B).    The Central Asian problem,  dealing as it  does with the conduct of operations in an undeveloped country, where the opposing sides start at a distance of several hundreds of miles from each other,  admits of the arrival of our Expeditionary Force in the field at a slow rate which would be inadmissible were the enemy nearer to our gates.   This reduction in the rate of mobilization has been imposed on us by financial stringency which limits the numbers of the effectives who will be available on mobilization; our only justification for accepting this disability is that the present European situation does not demand a greater degree of  preparedness,  and that the money thus saved is available for increasing the efficiency of the Army in the directionof further mechanization.      [17766]                                                       c 2
     We must, however,  again emphasize  the fact,  on which the Chief of  theImperial General Staff has already enlarged in paragraphs 7 and 8 of C.I.D. Paper847-B, that even our small Expeditionary Force of 5 divisions and 2 cavalry brigadesis, as it stands, seriously  deficient of reserves,  artillery  and armoured fighting vehicles.     43.  The foregoing review of the distribution of our mobile forces, whilst itadds emphasis to the concluding paragraph of the Review  of Imperial defence policy in 1926 (C.I.D. Paper  701-B), merely states what are,  in our opinion,  theminimum army requirements of this particular aspect of the problem.  In consideringwhere economies could be effected in order to try and meet our more urgent demandselsewhere, we have been struck with the necessity of impressing upon the non-self-governing Colonies the need for bearing  a greater  share of the responsibility  fortheir own local defence.  For instance, the remoteness of the likelihood of war with france or America has  enabled the Committee of Imperial Defence to adopt  therecommendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in favour of reductions inthe personnel detailed to the fixed defences of Sierra Leone and Bermuda;  in  theformer place, a battalion of local infantry is also being disbanded.   This reductionin West Africa has now so reduced the local forces as to make them capable of dealingwith internal trouble only;  but we think the time has arrived  when all  our west african Colonies should combine to consider the problem of defence against external aggression, should we at some future date unhappily go to war with  France.  GreatBritain cannot continue to  undertake the  local  defence  of  every  colony  anddependency throughout  the world,  except at a cost to herself  which  would  beprohibitive.                               VI. AIR POLICY.   &quot;     44. Home and Imperial Air Defences.   (CP. 421 (25).) It was approved inDecember 1925 by the Government that,  in addition  to meeting the  essential  airrequirements of the Navy, Army,  Indian and Overseas commitments, British  airpower must include a  Home Defence air  force of sufficient strength adequately toprotect us against air attack by  the strongest air force within striking  distance of thiscountry, and that, in the first  instance, the Home Defence  Force should consist of52 squadrons.     At present the Home Defence Air Force consists of 31 squadrons, but these  arehy no means in the proper proportion of  day bombers, night  bombers and fighters,nor yet are they correctly located according to  the needs  of wartime operations.Although a certain expansion of parks and depots has been effected as the scheme has advanced as a whole, the ground organisation essential for the completion of  thescheme is very behindhand.     Moreover,  the ground anti-aircraft gun and searchlight organization  is  farfrom complete.  The provision of searchlights is not on a scale sufficient to enablethe necessary training between  ground and air defence systems to be carried out.     Consequently, the  effective strength of the Home Defence Air Force cannot be measured by the proportion of formed squadrons to those which  are still to  be formed.  The Home  Defence Air Force cannot, correctly speaking, be described aseven half completed.     45.  Air Reserves-The problem of providing and maintaining the  necessaryair reserves  in personnel, aircraft and engines, and  indeed  in all kinds  of warmaterial, which are required to meet the wastage of a major war, has been engagingthe anxious attention of the Air Staff for some years past.     The problem is one of replacing wastage from the outbreak of war until training and supply facilities have developed  sufficiently  to replace casualties  to personnel and aircraft; and has been the  subject of concern to other  nations no  less than ourselves for many years.     It is hoped that the Air Staff will be in a position in the course of the next yearto put forward their suggestions for overcoming this difficulty.     At present it will  be sufficient to state here that our reserves are only sufficientto meet normal peace-time requirements and very minor emergencies.     46.  Coastal Reconnaissance and Defence Units. Another commitment not  yetfully met is the provision of air units at our main defended ports and bases at homeand overseas for the duty of coastal reconnaissance.  So far we possess three of these units only.  Two more are to be formed this year.  The total number of such units
which may ultimately be required is still under review, but the minimum requirements will in any case be considerably in excess of the numbers so far authorised.    47.  A ir Defences at Defended Ports A broad. Reference has already been madein  Section IV to the progress made towards the provision  of  air  defences  at singapore and other defended  ports abroad and attention directed to the lack of lying facilities, at or in  the vicinity of many of our defended ports both at homeand abroad.    48.

Approval has been given by the Government for the organisation of the chain of aerodromes throughout the Empire, to provide air portsalong the line of air communications, and so  to enable air  power to co-operate incoast  defence.    Organised routes already exist between Cairo and Basra and between Cairo andthe Cape.  A route also exists  across India, and between Karachi  and the  North-West  Frontier and the North-West Frontier and Calcutta.  Although these routesare not maintained in all cases for regular services, they are open and suitable foruse in case of emergency for the  passage of air units.    The section of the projected air route from Calcutta  to  Singapore has beensurveyed, but the preparation of sites on this section awaits the settlement of certainfinancial questions between the Governments  of India  and Malay  States and theHome  Government.    So far as the Basra-Karachi route  is  concerned, some  difficulty has  been experienced with the Persian  Government, and  no satisfactory  arrangement hasbeen reached for the passage of aircraft along the North side of the Persian Gulf.Surveys have been conducted  along the Arabian coast and the Persian  Gulf  with aview to establishing an alternative route for this section.  Information as  to possiblesites on this coast is not yet complete.    49.  Russia.   (C.I.D. Paper No. 165-D.) It has been approved that we are tomaintain  the  integrity  of a friendly Afghanistan.  The  plans  which  have  beenapproved in principle entail heavy demands upon our Air Defence Force, which is our only air reserve in a major war.    We cannot meet this commitment unless and until the Home and Imperial air defence Force is completed, and until certain requirements for the Royal Air Forcein India (specified in Paper D.I. 32) have been met.    50.  Fleet Air  Arm  and  Army  Co-operation Squadrons.    (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 701-B, paragraph 28.) The policy approved for the Royal Air Force under theseheads to meet the requirements for the Fleet Air Arm and for Army Co-operation issatisfactorily met.  The question of the recent reduction of the Fleet Air Arm reserves of Aircraft to 50 per cent, may, however, require reconsideration.                             VII. OBSERVATIONS.    51.  We concluded our first Annual Review in 1926 by placing on record ourview that the forces available for Imperial Defence were already reduced  to aminimum and were barely capable of dealing with the problems that were liable to arise, either singly or simultaneously.  That our view was in no way exaggerated,even when judged by the criterion of the normal police work of the Empire, is provedby the  strain to which we were put in furnishing, and still more in maintaining, the relatively small forces required  in  China  for the  protection of  our interests.Fortunately, the more  acute phases of that unfinished episode have not coincided with any situation calling for reinforcements such as might at any moment arise inEgypt  or elsewhere in the Middle East.     52.  The  present review shows that for any larger emergency our forces aretotally inadequate.  At the present time we cannot exert our full strength to meet a major  emergency  in the  Far East, nor shall  we be  able to do  so before  1937.Some years must elapse before we could provide adequate opposition to a russian aggression in Afghanistan.  We cannot,  in the early stages  of a war, do much,
except by naval means, to carry out our obligations under the Locarno Treaties.  Inlthe unlikely event of a hostile France, our position would be peculiarly difficult inregard to the defence of-our homelands against air attack, our trade routes throughthe Mediterranean, and, to a lesser extent,  on the route to the Cape, as well as inrespect to the defence of our colonies in West Africa.  As against the United Statesof America we have made no plans or preparations  of any  kind whatsoever.  in short, Imperial Defence is dependent  to a great extent on the maintenance of thegood relations which have been established with foreign Powers since the War.     53.  We have not the smallest desire to go outside our province to criticise thepolitical assumptions  summarised in  Part II as  to  the durability of these  good relations.  We recognise that, without  some such guiding assumptions, the burden of&quot;Imperial Defence,  calculated  solely  on  the  basis  of  an  abstract  strategicalappreciation,  would be well-nigh insupportable, and  that  there would be a  grave-risk of dissipating our resources in an attempt to  achieve the impossible.   We feel bound, however,  to impress  on the Committee of Imperial Defence how great a.responsibility this places on  those charged with  the day-to-day conduct of foreignaffairs to warn the Committee of Imperial Defence of the first hint of a less satisfac-tory  state of affairs,  in order that the necessary adjustments  in  our  defensivearrangements may be considered, the requisite preparations  for which would require a period  of some years to bring into effective operation.     54.  We are in no way  opposed in principle to mutual arrangements between nations for the reduction  and limitation of their  armaments.  In the case of theBritish Empire,  however, with its vast liabilities extending all  over the world,in which prestige is a factor of no small importance, there is an irreducible minimum which cannot be passed without the gravest danger.     55.  Similarly, at a time when our power of bringing pressure to bear on anenemy by means of the Fighting Forces is reduced, we  should view with dismay any international agreement &quot;such as that connoted in the expression  &quot;freedom of these as,&quot; which tended to limit the powers which our forces have exercised in the past.The  aggregate of the standing fighting forces is so  small in relation to our commit-ments that to-day less than ever before can we afford to  make concessions in regard tothe manner in which they have been used in the past to exert pressure on our enemies.    56.  In conclusion, having regard to the political assumptions stated  in para-graphs 8 to 14 above, we recommend that the  following developments in ImperialDefence should be placed first in order of priority, though we do not attempt to give them priority inter se:     (a.)  The naval building  programme to  carry out  the policy of His Majesty&apos;s.          Government, including the  replacement of Cruisers and other classes of          vessels, in order to attain the required, standard  of naval strength.    (&amp;.)  The completion of the &quot;truncated scheme&quot;  approved by His MajestyV       .  . Government for the Naval Base at Singapore, together with the first stage          of the coast defences, including the air defences, according to the  accepted          programme (C.I.D. Paper No. 277-C).    (c.) Steps such as further mechanisation of the Army and increasing,the rate of          mobilisation which may be found necessary for the Defence of India when          the detailed plan now being prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General.          Staff in consultation with the Chief of the Air Staff and the General Staff,          India, is completed,  in accordance  with Conclusion (2) (a) (iv) at the;          232nd  Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    (d.)  The completion of the authorised strength of the Home Defence Air Force,          which  forms our Imperial air reserve (CP. 421 (25)).    (e.) The provision of a Military reserve in the Mediterranean to meet emergencies-          arising in the Near East (vide paragraph 37 above).    (/.) The reduction of the  present garrison in China, and  its maintenance at a          strength which will provide sufficient reinforcements for North China in.          an emergency,  and will,  as far  as  resources allow, deter  Japan from          attacking Hong Kong.    (g.) The improvement of our system of intelligence in the Far East.    (h.)  The provision of aerodromes at defended  ports overseas (vide paragraph 32;          above).    (i.) The development of Imperial air routes (vide paragraph 48 above).
     We draw attention to the following developments of Imperial Defence, which,though important to security, cannot  at  present be  placed in the first  order  of-priority:-                            .     (j.) The increase of range of the coast defences at Hong Kong, as recommended           by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 235th Meeting.     (k.) The provision of aerodromes at defended ports at home (vide paragraph 32           above).     (I.) The re-organisation and completion of coast defences at Gibraltar, Malta,           and Aden.    (m.) The prosecution of the scheme for the anti-aircraft defence of Great Britain,  .           at least in so far as is necessary for  joint training purposes.     (n.) The completion of the coast defences at home.                              (Signed)        H. TEEN CHARD.                                             CHARLES E.

I.-WESTERN  EUROPE  AND  MOROCCO.                                 MOROCCO.   1.  THE  Franco-Spanish conversations regarding  Tangier terminated  in  the signature on the 3rd March, 1928, of an Agreement which provides for      (1) an increase in the penalties for promoting conspiracy and rebellion against           the established order in the three zones;     (2) the transfer to Tangier from  Malaga of the Franco-Spanish Information           Bureau, which will be under the charge of a Spanish Inspector-General;           and                    -     (3) the establishment of a gendarmerie under the command of a Spanish officer           with a strength of 400 men, which will  be reduced when the Tangier           zone has been disarmed, A conference consisting of British, French, Spanish and Italian representatives is now sitting at  Paris to discuss  first the Franco-Spanish Agreement,  and secondly the conditions on which the Italian Government are ready to accede to the Tangier Convention.  The British representatives are insisting on a date being fixed for the reduction in the numbers of the  gendarmerie, since a force of 400 men is too small to deal with a serious attack by tribesmen from the Spanish zone, and too large for ordinary  police work, while the expense  of  maintenance  even of 250 men will embarrass the Tangier financial system.         . -   -  -             II.-CENTRAL EUROPE  AND  THE BALKANS.                                 GERMANY.   2. His  Majesty&apos;s Governments commitments, in so far as Germany is concerned, remain the same to-day as in April 1927.  On the other hand, the situation described under the heading &quot; Germany &quot; on pages 10-12 of  the memorandum on the foreign policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, dated the 26th April,  1927, has  developed to a certain extent since then.   3. There are still Allied, including  British, troops on the  Rhine, though  the numbers of  those  troops have now  been reduced materially under the terms of an agreement concluded in September  1927, on  British initiative, between the three occupying Powers.   The German and French Foreign Ministers  exchanged orations at the end of January  1928  in  regard to  the conditions (relating principally to security and finance)  on which  an  evacuation of  the  Rhineland before the date contemplated by the Treaty of Versailles might be carried out. About the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government intimated in Parliament that they would  welcome any agreement with  that object which might be.concluded between the interested Powers. Belgium has also indicated her views in this connexion,  but nothing  concrete hasoccurred up to date to show that the various declarations which have been made are in process  of execution, such practical steps as are needed to realise the contemplatedcurtailment of the occupation being necessarily deferred until after the French andGerman elections have taken place in May..                             * Paper No. O.O.S. 93.      [17987]                                                         c
   4. There have, since the memorandum of 1927 was written, been certain develop-ments in the working of the Dawes Plan for the  payment of German reparationswhich require a brief explanation.  By the Treaty of Versailles, Germany undertook to make reparation for the loss and damage caused to the Allied Powers as a resultof the war.   In May 1921  the  amount of  that  compensation was fixed  by theReparation Commission at 132 milliards of gold marks.  Some payments on accountwere actually made, but apart from the fact that the  discharge of a debt of suchmagnitude was, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, incapable of realisation,the German economic and financial situation deteriorated to  such an extent duringthe years 1920-23 that a complete default in reparation payments became inevitable.This led to the Franco-Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, and the pledges policy in the rhineland.   The whole position was, however, materially altered by the adoption by the interested Governments, including the German, of the Dawes Plan,  and by its embodiment in the London Agreements of 1924.   5. The Dawes Plan fixed, with  careful regard to Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, the amounts annually due  from Germany  in respect  of reparation, and provided, by means of the functions of the Transfer Committee, a  system of protection  for the German exchange.   It did not, however, fix the number of annuities which germany would have to pay in total discharge of  her reparation liability, the actual annuities specified in the Plan being insufficient to cover year by year the interest at 5 per cent.on less than half the total debt fixed by the Reparation Commission in 1921, whichremains the legal amount due from Germany to the ex-Allies in respect of reparation.   6. The Dawes Plan came into force on the 1st September, 1924, and since that date the sums  for which it provided have duly been paid into the  reparation account.TJp till now, however, only reduced payments have had to be made.  The real strain will begin in September of this year, when the first full payments fall  due.  The problem at once arises as to how these full payments are to be  converted into sterling and dollars  without upsetting the stability  of the German currency.   Moreover,the dissipation of German resources and German credit through the over-spendingand over-borrowing in recent months  of the German public authorities  has  led the agent-General for Reparation Payments (who represents at  Berlin the  interests ofthe creditor Governments and who is responsible for the administration of the Plan)-to examine the working of the present system and  to attempt to improve it.  after certain unavailing appeals to the  German authorities to exercise greater prudencein the matter of foreign borrowing and administrative, extravagance,  he recentlydeclared publicly  that  the only  satisfactory  issue is &quot;to  be found  in the  finaldetermination of the German reparation liability on an absolute basis &quot; (i.e., without reference to the question  of Inter-Allied debts) &quot; that contemplates  no measure of transfer protection.&quot;  The issue thus publicly  presented is an extremely important and difficult one, which loses none of its difficulty and  importance from the factthat no settlement  on the  lines indicated  will  be  possible  without  the active co-operation of the United States Government, which  has always hitherto refusedto recognise  the inter-relation (accepted in Europe) of reparation and  Inter-Allied debts.   It is the  policy of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government, however,  to  prevent the problem from becoming active as long as possible, and, at any rate, not until after March  1929, when the new President  of the  United States takes  office. &apos;  In the meantime, the fact  that the  Allied occupation of the Rhineland is technically a guarantee  for the payment of reparations, makes it unlikely that the problem of a premature evacuation of the Rhineland can in present circumstances be dealt with otherwise than  as part of a general financial settlement to include war debts and reparations.                           -       -               . -   7. As regards the general relations between the British and German Governments, these remain good; even cordial;  a certain amount of dissatisfaction has, however, been  expressed in Germany  at the operation of  the  Safeguarding of  Industries Act, &amp;c, as incompatible with the terms of the Anglo-German Commercial Treaty of December 1924,  which, according to a  recent  declaration  by the  Minister of Commerce, will be denounced at the earliest possible moment (not before 1930).                                 AUSTRIA.   8. As regards the &quot;Anschluss&quot; question, recent indications seem to show that Italy might be prepared  to use this  question as a bargaining counter  with either Germany  or France.   It  is therefore  no longer safe to say (as  was said in the memorandum of 1927)  that she would in all circumstances fight to prevent having a common frontier with Germany.
                                 HUNGARY.   9. The statement made in last year&apos;s memorandum that the Locarno Treaty systemshowed signs of  bearing  fruit  in  Central and South-Eastern  Europe cannotunfortunately be  maintained.    Recent overtures on  these  lines were made byM. Benes, but they met with a most adverse response from  Count Bethlen himself.It must  therefore be concluded that  so long as  Hungary maintains her  present attitude both towards her neighbours and the Treaty of Trianon, the application of locarno principles to the security problem of Central Europe  is hardly a matter of practical politics.   10.  Even under the wise and temperate  leadership of Count Bethlen, Hungarymakes  no secret of her aim to secure a revision of her present frontiers, and LordRothermere&apos;s press campaign in  Great Britain and America to this end, coupled with the discovery of a large consignment of war material  in Hungarian territory in January 1928, has merely served to strengthen the Little Entente just at a moment when signs were not wanting that that alliance was becoming weakened and confusedowing  to the disintegrating effect of Italo-French rivalry in Central Europe.   11.  While it is true that  Hungary has signed commercial treaties with yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia,  it would be wrong to assume  that there has been any  material improvement in the political relations  between  Hungary and her  northern and southern neighbours.  If anything, a deterioration has been noticeable in  the case of yugoslavia since April 1927, when Hungary signed a Treaty of Friendship with italy.  Since that date no  progress has been made in the negotiations with Yugo-slavia  for Hungary&apos;s access to the Adriatic Sea,  which it  was at one time hopedwould  lead to wider agreements between the two countries.   12.  Hungary&apos;s relations with roumania and Czechoslovakia  have been poisoned bythe bitter controversy over the property of Hungarian landowners in Transylvania,which  for the past year has occupied the close attention of the Council of the Leagueof Nations and is not yet settled.   13.  British policy is directed to endeavouring to make plain to Hungary that thePeace  Treaty must be respected,  and when  neighbours that they are ill-advised to treat Hungary as a pariah, and generally that the  true road to peace and prosperityis by way of mutual arrangements for  non-aggression and conciliation on-the modelof the  arbitration treaties signed at Locarno.                                   ITALY.   14.  As regards the problem of increased population mentioned in the 1927 memo-randum,  the following factors should be stressed :  Although the chief pre-war outlet for Italian emigration, the United States  of America, is  now practically closed,Signor Mussolini has repeatedly announced his wish for a much  greater population.France now takes the bulk of Italian emigrants, and large compact colonies have beenformed in the South and South-Eastern Departments.  Steps are also being  taken byreclamation work to create more room in Italy itself.  The Fascist policy discouragesemigration to  foreign countries and aims at securing land  for colonisation.   Theexisting Italian colonies in Africa are incapable of supporting  a large white popula-tion, and Italy has recently been paying marked attention to  Cilicia, where she is carrying &quot;out an intensive peaceful penetration.  Should there be any reshuffling ofmandates, Italy would advance strong claims to receive one.   15.  Relations  between Italy  and France  have  continued  strained.  Unpleasantincidents have been  frequent along  the  Franco-Italian  frontier,  whilst the  largeItalian emigration into the South of France is a cause of serious misgiving.  In Tunisthe new French nationality decrees of 1921 impose  French nationality on all personsborn in the colony one of whose parents was also so born.  The  Italian colony, whichgreatly outnumbers the French, enjoyed the right to retain their&apos;own nationalityunder  the Franco-Italian Treaty of 1896, which,  however, was denounced  in  1918,and has since only been prolonged for three months  at a time pending its replacementby another agreement.   Thus the nationality of this large block of Italian settlers,whose  &quot; Italianita &quot; is continually stimulated  by Fascism, hangs  in the  balance.In Tangier again France is held to be opposing Italian claims to adequate representa-tion on the international regime.  There is also  a dispute  regarding the southernboundary of Tripoli, which the Italians claim should be moved farther south.  A turnfor the better took place during the winter, when, as a result of discreet pressure byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, the French  and Italian  Governments were finally induced to open conversations with a view to a settlement of the various points of friction       [17987]                                                        c 2
 between them.  Signor Mussolini has disclaimed any intention of making exaggerated demands,  whilst M.  Briand has announced his readiness  to  make  reasonable concessions to be followed up by a Treaty of Arbitration and Friendship.   16. As  regards the continued strained relations between  Italy and- Yugoslavia, both His Majesty&apos;s Government and France have urged on Italy and Yugoslavia the desirability of threshing out their  differences by means of direct conversations,  but although the Yugoslav Minister in Borne has been  cordially received by Signor Mussolini,  the latter  has  steadily refused  to be drawn into any discussion or explanation of his policy which would be  likely  to allay suspicion  in Yugoslavia. In these unsatisfactory circumstances  it w;as decided last January to extend until June next the  period within  which notice must  be  given of  the renunciation or renewal of the ineffective Pact of Rome  between  Italy and Yugoslavia, which provides for mutual consultation and co-operation.  Italo-Yugoslav relations, are  really now dependent on Franco-Italian relations,  and unless  the negotiations now initiated at Tiome lead to a better Franco-Italian understanding, a more satisfactory relationship between Yugoslavia and Italy can hardly be expected.   17.  Quite recently we have had an indication of improved relations between Italy and Turkey.  It is reported that Signor Mussolini  considers the opening for trade of more importance to Italy than  the chance of some day carving a colony or mandated territory out of Asia Minor.                               THE  BALKANS.   18.  France has now signed the Treaty with Yugoslavia which, in the memorandum of 1927, was described as being in  suspension.  This treaty at once provoked  Italy into still further tightening her hold  on Albania, and within  a few days of  its signature she had concluded a twenty-years&apos; defensive alliance with Albania, whereby each State agrees to devote all its resources to their  reciprocal defence and protection against all aggression.   19.  Yugoslavia sees in this move  a further threat to her south-west frontier, which is not diminished by  her conviction that certain elements of the present regime in Italy give countenance to the Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation in Bulgaria, whose avowed object  is the  restoration  of Southern Serbia to the Bulgarian organ.Detailed memoranda  on the system of treaties now in existence in Central Europe and on the Macedonian problem are available.                   -   20.  It is the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government to strengthen the influence of theLeague of Nations in the Balkans, to inculcate as far as possible the principles laid down at Locarno, and to counsel  moderation when  difficult situations arise.  It hasbeen a,source of encouragement that Serbian foreign policy has for  the last  yearbeen under&apos; the direction of M.  Marinkovitch, who has given  ample proof  of astatesmanlike outlook in dealing with the complex questions with which Yugoslavia,surrounded as she is by no less  than seven neighbours, is confronted.                   III.-TURKEY AND MIDDLE EAST.                                   TURKEY.   21.  During the past year Mustapha  Kemal has further consolidated his  positionas dictator, and has  continued the process of  the modernisation of Turkey.   In-international  relations there are signs  that the attitude  of  suspicious isolation isyielding before  a desire that Turkey should play  a part  in world politics, cf.  the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; wish  to attend the Preparatory Disarmament Conference at Geneva,  the necessary invitation  to which was  procured through the good offices of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  -     ;&apos;    Turkish relations with  this country are apparently improving from day to day.                                 THE  STRAITS.              ;  &apos;  .....   22.  There has been no change during the past year in the: position indicated inparagraphs 73-75 of the memorandum dated the 26th April, 1927.  1                         .     .PERSIA. ;       ;  &quot;,        &apos;    \  &apos;   23. During the past year  Persia has been able to reach a comprehensive settlementof all her outstanding, disputes with Russia.  A series of agreements, including a;
treaty of guarantee and  neutrality,  a commercial convention,  and  an agreement regarding Caspian Fisheries, was signed on  the  1st October, and has since been ratified and come into force.   24.  The Persian Government&apos;s relations with His Maj esty&apos; s Government during theyear have not been so fortunate.  In March they withdrew  the permission given to imperial Airways (Limited) to operate a commercial air service from Iraq to Indiaalong the shores Of the Persian Gulf; no reason was given for their decision save the&quot; interests of the country,&quot; the &quot;internal situation and frontier considerations,&quot;but the probable reason for their attitude was a fear that the route might in timecome to be considered as an important strategic air line of the British Empire.  InMay, again, they announced their intention of terminating in May 1928 the systemof foreign Consular jurisdiction in Persia known as the  Capitulations,  and anyother exceptional privileges to which foreigners were entitled.   With this end  inview they denounced at a yea.r&apos;s notice  all the treaties in  which such  rights and privileges had been embodied.  Although no British treaty was  so denounced,  thePersian action has made it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government  to endeavourto negotiate a fresh treaty to safeguard the interests of  British nationals in Persia.   25. After the settlement of their differences with Russia, the Persian Governmentprofessed a  strong desire  to reach a similar settlement  with Great Britain of all outstanding questions, and on the 31st December the Shah expressed his wish thatHis  Majesty&apos;s  Minister at Tehran would enter into secret negotiations with  his minister of the  Court on  all the main questions still  under discussion between  thetwo Governments.   These negotiations are still proceeding.                                    IRAQ.   28. Since the memorandum for last year was prepared the position has been modified by the  conclusion in December, 1927, of a new Anglo-Iraq Treaty.  This treaty hasnot yet entered into force, and it is  not proposed to  ratify it until the revisedFinancial and Military Agreements envisaged in Articles XII and XIII have been concluded, and all three  instruments  approved by the  Council  of. the  League  ofNations.  Some time must, therefore, elapse  before the new treaty and connectedagreements  can  become operative.   In  the  meantime,  the relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Iraq  Government  are governed by the Anglo-IraqTreaty of the 10th October,  1922, and subsidiary agreements, and the  subsequenttreaty of the 13th January, 1926, and the  commitments of His Majesty&apos;s government towards Iraq, remain as defined therein.                    \   27. It may be useful, however, to consider the more important variations betweenthe new treaty and the earlier instruments in so far as these may  affect the commit-ments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  Whereas Article VII of the treaty of 1922contained an implied undertaking to provide support and assistance to the armed forces of the King of Iraq, the corresponding article (Article  XIII) of the new treatycontains no  such undertaking.  It merely provides that a separate agreement shallregulate the military relations between the high contracting  parties.   28. Formal negotiations in regard to the revised Military  Agreement have not yetopened.  A  draft has, however,  been prepared,  has been approved by the  Cabinet,and has been forwarded to the High  Commissioner for Iraq for  communication to&apos;the Iraq Government.  From past experience it would seem probable that the text ofthe draft will undergo substantial modification in the course  of negotiation  with theIraq Government, and a detailed examination of the present text would not thereforeserve any useful purpose;  but certain articles, viz., Articles I, TV and  IX, in thedraft have already been definitely accepted both by His Majesty&apos;s Government and,on behalf of the  Iraq Government, by King Faisal, and there is,  therefore,  good reason to suppose that these articles will be embodied in  the final agreement in theirpresent form.   29. Article I reads as follows :          &quot; The two Governments hereby recognise the principle that the Government    of Iraq shall at the earliest possible date  accept full responsibility, both for the    maintenance of internal  order  and  for  the  defence of Iraq  from  external    aggression.   They also recognise, however, that&quot; the resources of Iraq are at    present insufficient for this purpose, and therefore His Britannic Majesty&apos;s    Government in Great Britain will afford such support and  assistance  as they    may consider necessary and decide upon from time to time.&quot;
    It will be seen that the qualifying clause in the corresponding article of the-existing Military Agreement  (which  committed  the  Iraq  Government  to  theacceptance in 1928 of  full responsibility for  internal security  and defence from.external aggression) has been omitted  from the  new article, which now definitelyrecognises  the present inability  of the  Iraq Government  fully  to  accept this-responsibility.  The extent and nature of the military assistance to be afforded to-the Iraq Government from time to time is, however, left entirely to the judgment of.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government.   30. Article IV reads as follows :          &quot;His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain agree to grant    facilities in the following matters, the cost^of which will be met  by the Iraq    Government: *         (1.) Military  and aeronautical instruction of Iraq officers in Great Britain.               so far as this may be possible.         (2.) The provision in sufficient quantities of arms, ammunition, equipment               and aeroplanes of the latest available pattern for the Iraq Army.         (3.) The provision of British officers (in such numbers as may  be mutually-               agreed  upon between  the two Governments)  for  the  purpose  of               ensuring efficient co-operation  between the British forces  in  Iraq               and the Iraq Army. Such officers shall be employed upon terms of               service identical with those upon which British Military Officers are               at present serving.&quot;    The text of this article differs but little from that of Article  II of the Military-Agreement of the 25th March,  1924.    The reference  in the latter article to thepresence in Iraq either of an Imperial Garrison or of local Forces maintained  byHis Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  Government  finds no place in the new article, but  it isproposed to deal with this in a separate article.   31. Article IX (an extract from which is given below) is of more importance.         &quot; The Iraq Government shall  be entitled to the  assistance of any forces    maintained or controlled in  Iraq  by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government  in    Great Britain against or for the suppression of any external aggression or any    civil disturbance or armed rising,  provided that it shall not, in the opinion of    the High Commissioner, have been provoked or occasioned by  action taken,  or    policy  pursued, by the  Iraq  Government  contrary to  the  express  wishes    or contrary to or without the advice of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in    Great  Britain.&quot;    Under the terms of the corresponding article (Article VIII)  of the military agreement of the 25th March,  1924,  it might have  been argued  that no  definiteobligation  was placed upon His Majesty&apos;s Government  to  give assistance to theIraq Government in the event of unprovoked attack.  It was, however, held at thetime that such an obligation was, in fact, implicit in the article.  As will be seen,any ambiguity on this score has been  removed in the new article, which,  in thecircumstances stated, definitely entitles the Iraq Government to the assistance of any british forces in Iraq.   32. There is one other article  in the principal treaty which calls for comment.Whereas Article VI of the Treaty of 1922 did not specify any definite date for the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations, Article VIII of the new treaty, subject, to certain provisos, commits His Majesty&apos;s Government to supportthe candidature of Iraq for admission to the League in 1932.   33. Article VIII of  the  1922 Treaty, which provided that no territory in Iraqshould be ceded, or leased, or in  any way placed under the control of any foreign.Power, finds no place in the new treaty.                   PALESTINE  AND  TRANS-JORDAN.  34. British commitments in regard to Palestine and Trans-Jordan are still coveredby the Mandate, Article 5 of which lays down the  territorial guarantee given byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of those countries.  By the agreement between his Majesty and His Llighness the Amir of Trans-Jordan, which was signed in
February 1928, but has not  yet been ratified:  (1)  His Majesty  is empowered tomaintain armed forces in Trans-Jordan and to raise, organise and  control in Trans-Jordan such armed forces as  may, in his opinion be necessary for the defence of thecountry and to assist the Amir in the preservation of peace and order;  and (2) the amir agrees that he will not raise or maintain in Trans-Jordan or allow  to be raisedor maintained any military forces  without the consent of His Britannic Majesty.                         THE HEJAZ AND  NEJD.  35. The commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Nejd, deriving from  the treaty concluded with Ibn Saud as Sultan of Nejd on the 26th December,1915,  have been extinguished  by the conclusion on the 20th May, 1927, of the Treatyof  Jeddah, signed  by  Ibn  Saud as  King of  the Hejaz  and Nejd  and  itsDependencies.  This instrument contains no commitments of any sort.  36. A crisis in the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and  Ibn Saudarose  at the end of 1927.  Ibn  Saud protested that the construction of an advancedintelligence post,  some 75 miles from the Iraq-Nejd frontier, was contrary  to theprovisions  of  an  agreement between himself  and  the  King  of  Iraq  regulatingfrontier  tribal relations;  he added that it was causing apprehension  and excite-ment  among his tribes.  In the opinion  of His Majesty&apos;s Government there was noquestion of any infraction of the agreement, and the object of the fort was solelythe prevention of tribal raids,  against which Ibn Saud himself had complained tothe High  Commissioner  at  Bagdad.   The fierce  and  fanatical Wahabis were,however,  undoubtedly  alarmed  and excited,  and   on  the  5th  November  theyexterminated the  small garrison.  Thereafter they carried out several further raids against Iraq tribes in Iraq territory, and one against a Trans Jordanian tribe inNejd  territory.  The protests  of His Majesty&apos;s Government to Ibn  Saud had no effect  and it was  accordingly decided  to retaliate by air action against  the raiders,where necessary pursuing them into Nejd territory.  Ibn Saud was notified of  thisdecision before action was  taken.   Having hitherto endeavoured  to  exculpatehimself and his tribes by the allegation that Iraq had broken a treaty, as soon asaeroplanes had crossed his frontier in pursuit  of parties of raiders he  complained that this violation of his territory had  destroyed  his  work of  pacification,  andadmitted that he could no longer control the Wahabi.  Possibly this was true.   Atany rate  the  three great Akhwan tribes, the Mutair,  Ataibi and  Ajman, wererumoured to have come  out  under  their banners and to have  proclaimed a Jihadagainst all non-Wahabi. All possible measures were taken for the defence of Iraq,Transjordan and Koweit, but Ibn Saud was informed that if he could give certainassurances (which are hitherto not forthcoming), orders would be issued, in order toenable him to  regain control, that no aircraft should cross the Nejd frontier exceptin active pursuit  of raiders.  The latest  reports, however, tend to discredit theearlier rumours of a Jihad, and to  indicate that Ibn Saud  has dissociated himself from  any such movement and  that he has been at least temporarily successful indetaching from it the important Ataibi  tribe.  37. The underlying causes of this unfortunate situation are probably Ibn Saud&apos;sdislike and distrust of Feisal and Abdullah, which he extends to British officials inIraq  and  Transjordan, together  with the  raiding propensities and religiousfanaticism of the  Wahabis.  The latter form Ibn Saud&apos;s fighting force in case of need,  but his control over them is precarious.  Throughout the whole period he hasnot ceased to proclaim his friendship  for His Majesty&apos;s Government and to appeal for their assistance in reaching a solution of the difficulties which he attributes tothe policy of  the Iraq Government.   It has now been decided  that Sir GilbertClayton, who negotiated the Treaty of Jeddah with him, should be sent put to discussthe situation and to endeavour to reach a  solution.  Given  the frontier conditions and tribal characteristics, this  will be no easy task.                          THE IDEISI OF  ASIR.  38. There have been at least two missions from Ibn Saud to the ImamYehia duringthe past year to discuss outstanding issues,  notably the Asir  question, but, as far asis known, no result has been achieved.  But neither ruler has shown any disposition to seek a solution by more forcible methods.  A mission from the Imam has recentlycome  to Mecca and has been received with great ceremony.                     , %
        THE  ADEN PROTECTORATE AND THE RED SEA  AREA.   39. The Imam was informed in March 1927 that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to secure a friendly settlement of their differences with him, they could not recognise that he had any rights whatever within the Aden Protectorate, and they warned him that his continued occupation of parts of it would render him liable to  retaliatory measures.   In spite  of  this  communication,  armed  Zeidi forces penetrated further into the Protectorate in September 1927, and only withdrew  on being warned that air action would  be  taken against  them.   Warnings  were then dropped on certain towns in the Yemen that, in the event of further incursions being made into  the  Protectorate,  air action would be taken against them.   On the 8th February last the Zeidis kidnapped the Alawi  Sheikh and a  relation of the Koteibi Sheikh, both of whom are entitled by  treaty to  the  protection of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   After forty-eight hours&apos; notice, air action was taken against Kataba, in Yemen territory, which is understood to be the headquarters  of those Zeidi forces directly responsible for  the outrage.  In the  circumstances,  there is necessarily some degree of uncertainty as to the future.  It must depend largely upon the effects produced by air action, which has been continued,  and upon the extent to which the Zeidis are made  to realise that they cannot raid  the Aden Protectorate with impunity.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government have not, and never have had, the smallest desire to quarrel with the Imam.  They are still anxious, as they always have been, to come to a settlement with him on honourable terms which will satisfy the just claims of both parties and place their future relations on a friendly and neighbourly basis, but no settlement could be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s  Government which did not take account of their obligations to the tribes of the Aden Protectorate.            IY. NORTHERN  EUROPE  AND AFGHANISTAN.         POLAND,  THE  BALTIC STATES AND  SCANDINAVIA.  40.  Of these countries, little need be said.  Our general aim here, as elsewhere, is peace and stability.  In the multilateral declaration of the 23rd April,  1908, His Majesty&apos;s Government  announced, jointly  with the Danish,  French,  Dutch and Swedish Governments,  their firm resolution to  preserve intact and  mutually  to respect the sovereign rights  at that time  enjoyed by the parties concerned over their respective territories  in the regions  bordering on  the North Sea, and to  concert together &apos;&apos; such measures as they  (the signatories) may consider it useful to take&apos;&apos;  in the event of any menace to  the status quo.   The. original German participation  in this declaration has lapsed in accordance with article 289 of the Treaty of Versailles. There is no such agreement relating to the Baltic, and, apart from obligations which may arise under the Covenant of the League, we should not  be bound to resist any change such as the federation of the  Baltic States,  or even their reabsorption by  Russia.   . In the  dispute &quot;between  Poland  and  Lithuania,  His Majesty&apos;s Government, in  pursuance of their general policy of  ensuring peace and stability, have  encouraged, and taken part in, action by the League of Nations to induceLithuania to resume friendly relations with Poland, while avoiding anything unduly wounding to the former&apos;s amour-propre;  but they have refused to join with other Powers in any attempt to impose a settlement by direct pressure.                                  RUSSIA.  41. The examination by the police  on the 12th May, 1927,  of  the  premises ofArcos (Limited) and of the Russian Trade Delegation conclusively proved that both military espionage and subversive activities throughout the British Empire were directed and carried out from the premises of the above institutions.  His Majesty&apos;s-Government therefore informed the Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires on the 26th May, 1927,.that they regarded themselves as free from the obligations of the Trade Agreementof 1921, and could no longer maintain  diplomatic relations with the Soviet Govern-ment, though  they had no intention  of interfering with the ordinary course oflegitimate Anglo-Russian trade.  This step does not, of course, imply the withdrawalof our de jure recognition of the Soviet  Government.  42. It seems most probable that Russia will not be in a position for many years to wage war on a  considerable scale outside the  boundaries of the Union  of Soviet
f                                      13  &quot; Socialist Republics.  The action which is to be feared from her  (apart  from her persistent anti-British propaganda) is that of gradual extension of her influence in directions which affect British interests.   43. From the more  purely political point of view  it  can be stated that the conviction  of  the  Soviet Government that Flis Majesty&apos;s  Government  foment opposition to them on every  side is founded on a myth.  Our attitude  is purely defensive.  The hostile propaganda of the Soviet Government has, indeed, led to a breach of diplomatic relations, but no reason is seen to anticipate naval or military action.  Apart from our obligations under the Covenant of the League  of Nations, we have no obligations  to render military assistance to any foreign country in the event of Russian aggression.  So far as attacks on our own territory are concerned, the point of interest is, of course, India, and Russian  policy in Afghanistan  and Chinese Turkestan demands our unremitting vigilance.  That policy,  if it succeeds at all, will take the shape of an extension of Russian influence and perhaps control, but any such development must be gradual, and any early effect on  the requirements of British military preparedness  will  be indirect.  The dangers to be feared are those of Soviet intrigues in Afghanistan, the fomentation of hostile activity among the frontier tribes of India, and subversive propaganda in India itself, rather than the debouching of Russian forces on to Indian territory.                               AFGHANISTAN.   44.  There are no  signs  at present of any likelihood   of  acute  trouble  with Afghanistan, such as might lead to a repetition of the war of 1919.  Unless and until Russia becomes more aggressive and aims at creating a breach, our responsibilities will probably be limited to ordinary watchfulness and the endeavour to prevent any undesirable extension of Russian influence.   45.  We are under no  obligation to the Afghan Government to  defend any of their frontiers, but the  Committee of Imperial Defence  have  recently  reaffirmed, as a cardinal principle,  that &apos;&apos; by our own plain interest, our  obligations to guard the independence and  integrity of Afghanistan are  unimpaired, and  the deliberate crossing of the  Oxus or the occupation of Herat by Russia would be the violation of a frontier which we are bound to defend &quot;  ; and that,  in the last resort, &quot; Russian action of the kind indicated would be followed by a declaration of war against that Power.&quot; The Committee of  Imperial Defence  have left for further consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India the question of what steps can be taken to place the Army and Royal  Air Force  in India in the state of preparedness required by such a policy.  The question of a  public announcement of this policy has also been left  for the decision of  the Cabinet.  If no announcement is made the policy will  have no deterrent effect on the Union  of Socialist Soviet Republics;  if too categorical an  announcement  is made, the Afghan Government will imagine that they can adopt what policy they like  towards the Soviet Govern- ment, and. that whatever happens we shall be obliged to  defend them.  The formula suggested by the Committee is :          &quot; That  Britain could never regard  with indifference the interference by a     foreign Power in the existing territory of a  friendly Afghanistan, but that the     exact steps  which  ought, in  that event, to be taken  must depend  upon the     circumstances of the moment.&quot;   46.  Conversations  have taken place between King Amanulla and His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the course of His Majesty&apos;s visit to England, but these conversations have not resulted in any change in the situation.                       Y. EGYPT  AND  ABYSSINIA.                                    EGYPT.   47.  During the antumn of 1927 a treaty was negotiated with the Egyptian Prime Minister which provided for an Anglo-Egyptian alliance,  regularised the position of the British army of occupation, and, in effect, confined our obligation to  intervene on behalf  of foreign interests to  cases likely to  imperil  good relations between Egypt and  a foreign power, or to threaten the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt.  The draft treaty was, however, rejected by the Egyptian Government in March 1928, with the result that the  Declaration  of February&apos; 1922,  with its consequential commitments described above, remains in force.

So far as treaty obligations are concerned, the position of Great Britain is determined by the treaties signed at the time of the Washington Conference for theLimitation of Armament in 1921-22.  In actual fact, however, the position has been modified by events arising out of the Chinese civil war.  49. The  obligations created by the Washington Treaties are analysed in  thememorandum submitted in  1926.  For  convenience  of  reference that analysis isrepeated here :         &quot; The two principal international instruments which at present govern the    relations between the four great Pacific Powers (Great Britain, Japan, United    States and France) and between the Powers enjoying treaty rights in China and    China herself, are         (a.)  The Four-Power Treaty signed at Washington on the 13th December,               1921;  and        (6.)  The Nine-Power Treaty signed on the 6th February, 1922.    These two treaties are at once the result and the guarantee of  the attitude of    quiescence or policy of co-operation and  non-interference  in Chinese affairs,    adopted  by the Powers  with good  or ill  grace after  the war, and  they  are    characteristic of  the phase through which  the  relations of  the Far Eastern    Powers are still passing.        By the Four-Power Treaty the contracting parties (the United States,  the    British Empire, France and  Japan) agreed  to respect  their rights in relation    to their  insular possessions and dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean.    Any controversies arising out of any specific question not satisfactorily settled    by diplomacy are to be  submitted for  consideration to  a joint conference;  the    contracting Powers are to communicate  with one  another in the  event of    aggressive action by any  other Power threatening the said  rights; the treaty    is to be  in force  for ten years,  and thereafter to continue  in force subject to    twelve months&apos; notice by any  contracting party; upon ratification of the treaty    (i.e., the 17th August,  1923)  the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Agreement had to    terminate.   A subsequent treaty (the 6th February,  1922)  defined the  term    &apos; insular  possessions and  insular dominions &apos; in its application to Japan as    not to include the main islands of Japan.        On the 2nd February, 1922, His Majesty&apos;s Government gave an assurance    to the Government of Portugal, and on the 4th February to the  Government of    the Netherlands,  that, although these  countries were not parties to the Four-    Power Treaty, yet Great Britain was firmly  determined to respect their rights    in relation to their insular possessions in the region of the  Pacific.  Similar    assurances were given by the  United States of America, France  and Japan.        By  Article 19 of. the Washington  Treaty  for  the Limitation  of Naval    Armaments,  signed on the  6th  February, 1922, Flis  Majesty&apos;s  Government    undertook to  maintain the status quo&apos; with  regard to fortifications and naval    bases at  Hong Kong, and in our insular possessions in the  Pacific Ocean, east    of 110o  longitude,  except  (a) those  adjacent to the  coast of Canada; (&amp;)  the    Commonwealth of Australia and its territories; and (c) New Zealand.        By  the  Nine-Power  Treaty,  the contracting Powers  other than China    (United  States, Belgium, British Empire, France,  Italy,  Japan, Netherlands    and Portugal) agreed. (1)  to respect  the sovereignty, the independence and the    territorial and administrative integrity of  China; (2) to provide the fullest and    most unembarrassed opportunity to China to develop and maintain for herself    an effective and stable Government;  (3) to use their influence for the purpose of    effectually establishing and maintaining  the principle of equal opportunity for :   the commerce and industry of all nations throughout  the territory of China;    (4)  to refrain from taking advantage  of conditions in China in order to seek    special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens    of friendly States and  from countenancing  action inimical  to  the security of    such States.                          .        They further agreed not to  enter into any treaty or agreement contrary to    these  principles,  and that in  deference to  the principle of the  &apos;open  door&apos; or
    equality of opportunity in China they would not seek nor support their nationals    in seeking : (a) any arrangement which might purport to establish in favour of    their interests any general superiority of rights with respect to commercial or    economic development in any designated region of China; (b) any such monopoly    or preference as would deprive nationals  of  any other Power of the right of    undertaking any legitimate trade or industry in China, or of participating with    the Chinese Government or with any local authority in any category of public    enterprise which, by reason of its scope,  duration or geographical extent, is    calculated to frustrate the practical  application of  the  principle of  equal    opportunity.        Other articles of the treaty stipulate :  (i) that there will be no attempt by    the Powers concerned to create spheres of influence;  (ii) that there will be no    unfair discrimination  on  Chinese railways;   (iii) that Chinese neutrality in    future wars will be respected;  (iv) that the Powers concerned  will communicate    frankly and freely between themselves in any future situation affecting the treaty;    (v) that other Powers,  having treaty relations with China, shall  be invited to    adhere to the treaty; (vi) that the treaty shall come into force on the deposit of    ratifications .(i.e., the  5th August, 1925).  No  definite date is fixed  for  the    duration of the treaty.        The following  Powers  have  acceded to the treaty:   Sweden,  Norway,    Denmark and Spain.&quot;  50. At the present date, Great Britain is bound by the provisions of these treaties ;but the somewhat passive role played  by  China in the international experiment atWashington  has changed  to one  of  disconcerting activity which necessitated  acorresponding change in the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and an  advancebeyond the  limits of  the  attitude of &quot;wait-and-see&quot;  benevolence, adopted atWashington.   The  civil war as a  struggle  between North  and South,  betweenLiberal (Kuomintang) and Conservative  groups,  between rival military chieftainsand civilian intriguers with apparently neither principles nor patriotism has beenendemic in China since 1911.  But in 1925 this mild chaos was galvanised by a change which speeded up the march of events and profoundly altered the relations betweenChina and foreign Powers. The immediate cause of this change is to be  found inthe shooting incidents at Shanghai, Canton and Hankow in the summer of 1925; theultimate  cause in the- widening and deepening of Nationalist sensibilities and inthe active intervention of Russian agents and propaganda in the domestic affairs ofChina.  From 1919  to. 1925 no  party in the  Chinese civil war had  been  activelysupported by any foreign  Power.   In 1925 Russia  began actively to support theKuominchun in  North China and the Kuomintang in Canton.   This interventionand assistance altered the balance of power between the rival factions;  it introduced a spirit of determination and extremism which had hitherto  been lacking, and  itinspired a degree of  enmity against Great Britain which in ordinary circumstances and in an ordinary country  could only have led to war.  The state of affairs produced by the Canton boycott of Hongkong can only be described  as a kind of one-sided  warin which Great Britain  resolutely refused to pick up the challenge thrown  down toher because she believed that in the amorphous state of China it  was impossible tofind a vital spot for a decisive blow, and that to have embarked on a desultory wai inChina would have been to  play Russia&apos;s game both in the Far East  and  at home.Our inactivity, however, strengthened the prestige of the Canton Kuomintang  andpromoted its victorious advance  from Canton to the Yangtse in the latter halfof 1926.  51. The Kuomintang, however, was formed out of two irreconcilable elements the left Wing,  allied to the Communists  and the  Russians, and the Right Wing, whowere certainly anti-Communist and probably anti-Russian except in so far as theycould get  material help out of Russia.   The Right Wing were not averse to friendly relations with Great Britain, and the  Left Wing,  aware of this, were determined toprevent any such tendency by inciting incidents.   The first of these incidents  wasthe mob  attack on the British concession  at  Hankow.   This  incident led to thedespatch of the defence force to Shanghai to  prevent any similar incident in that city,but it was considered inexpedient to recapture the Hankow concession by  force inview of His Majesty&apos;s Governments promise to China regarding the rendition of con-cessions (see below,  paragraph 52). The second incident was the attack on british nationals  (including the Consul-General)  at Nanking by soldiers of the Kuomintangarmy when they captured,  that city.  American, Japanese,  French and  Italiansubjects also suffered, and for a moment it looked  as if united action would be taken
 by these Powers to punish the aggressors.   But, as so often happens in China, the objective for retaliatory action faded away  owing to  the definite split  in the Kuomintang which followed immediately on the outrages, the anti-Communist action taken by the Chinese themselves, the setting up of an entirely new Government  (in no way personally responsible for the outrages) at Nanking, and the hesitation and divided counsels  among the Powers  concerned.  The  moment for the  satisfactory settlement of the incident was therefore lost.   52. But  besides the despatch  of the  defence force  to  Shanghai, His Majesty&apos;s Governments China policy had already undergone another important modification. This was also caused by the deliberate singling out of Great Britain for attack by the Chinese Nationalists in 1925 and also by the failure of the Peking Tariff Conference in 1925-26 to liquidate the promises made  at Washington regarding the increase of China&apos;s tariff duties.  The Tariff Conference came to an inconclusive end (1) because of the attitude of certain Powers, notably  Japan and the  United States, in their determination to  get  their unsecured debts secured on the additional customs revenues, and (2) because the course of the civil war made  it impossible for the Chinese to present anything like a representative delegation.  His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment, however, considered that, in view of the lapse of time, it was impossible to hold up the Washington promises any longer, and therefore that, since it was impossible to impose conditions, the additional customs revenues should be levied at the various ports, unconditionally.  This proposal was laid before the United States Government on the 28th May, 1926.  A few months later the Canton Government proceeded to levy  the additional revenues.  His- Majesty&apos;s Government joined in a pro  forma protest, but that was all.  On the 18th December, 1926, His Majesty&apos;s Government renewed their proposal in a memoradum communicated  to  the representatives (at Peking) of  all the Washington Treaty Powers; further,  as the Extra-territoriality Commission had just reported, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government added a suggestion that the Commission^  recommendations should be carried into effect as soon as possible and that &apos;&apos; the Powers should make it clear that in their constructive  policy they desired to go as far as possible towards meeting the  legitimate aspirations of the Chinese nation.&quot;  This memorandum, which will  undoubtedly be a landmark in the history of Anglo-Chinese relations, was followed by an offer of measures for treaty modification which His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to take if  the Chinese authorities  in North or  South desired them to do so.  This  offer deals with the recognition  of the Chinese law courts and of a reasonable Chinese nationality law, the application of  Chinese law in British courts, the payment of Chinese  taxation by British subjects, the consideration of the application of the revised Chinese penal code, the modification of the municipal administration of British concessions, and the rights of British missionaries and their  converts. The publication of this offer, which at the time  the Chinese affected to disparage, has had  an increasing influence in promoting a more friendly attitude towards Great Britain.  It has taken the sting out of the attack on Great Britain as  protagonist of the old treaty position, and it has placed the Chinese in  a quandary, since when it comes to work out the details for modification, they find  that practical difficulties are very great and that there was more to be said, even from their own point of view, in favour of the old arrangements than  they could ever be brought  to admit.   At Hankow, for instance,  the Chinese were singularly unsuccessful in their attempts to administer the. recovered concession. At Tieh-tsin, where a modifying  agreement had been  initialled, demands for  the return of the concession gradually faded  away as the Chinese  became less and less ready to acquire advantages which&apos;would also entail responsibility.   53. &quot;One more result of the Nanking outrages should  also be mentioned, viz., theinstructions  sent by His Majesty&apos;s Admiralty to  the Commander-in-Chief, China,on the  11th May, 1927.    These .  instructions gave  the  Commander-in-Chief much wider  powers than he had formerly possessed to take immediate retaliatory action inthe event of outrages which  (1)  endangered the  lives  of British nationals, or (2) endangered British property  when there was actual  deliberate and wanton destruction of property.   These instructions have,  as a matter of fact, not been usedexcept in cases of desultory firing by Chinese troops at British vessels. -  54. To: resume, the policy of His majesty&apos;s Government in China is still based on the Washington Treaty ; but this has been modified  in two directions, which are not in fact so divergent  as they seem at first sight.  The. first direction  is towards thenecessity for defending British lives and property, which  led to the  despatch of the defence force and to the  issuing of  the revised instructions  to the  Commander-in-Chief.  The second direction is towards  the,necessity for proving indisputably to
the Chinese people that His Majesty&apos;s Government are. not reactionary or unfriendlytowards their efforts (such  as they are) to improve themselves, and their conditions,and their status in the world;  this led to the memorandum  of the 18th December,1926, and the treaty modification offer of the 28th January, 1927.  55. It may be added that for the moment the Chinese, both North and South ofthe Yangtse, have become so exasperated with the Russians and their methods that russian influence is practically non-existent, and that the Chinese Communist Party(which is almost entirely political rather than social in its activities) has been drivenunder ground.  In the present exhausted and desperate state of China, however,it would  be most unwise  to  predict  that we had heard  the last  of either theCommunistic or the Russian influence.  56. Our relations with the various Chinese Governments at Peking, at Nanking,at Hankow, at Canton are not unfriendly.  The anti-British feeling of the last three years has abated.  There are encouraging signs of the revival of British trade.So far as this country is concerned the prospects are better than they have been for along time; but there are no signs of a peaceful  settlement of the civil  war, and solong as the civil war continues. China will be a danger area in international relations.                                   JAPAN.  57. Our relations with Japan are governed by the same Washington Treaties whichhave been analysed in paragraph 49 above. The Four-Power  Treaty, especially, hastaken the place of the old Alliance Agreement, and, although friendly orators in both countries  are fond of announcing that the spirit of the alliance still  exists, as a&apos;matter of fact our relations are polite rather than intimate.   The two factors whichkeep Japan and  Great Britain united are (1) the fear  of a common danger from china or from Russia threatening their respective interests,  and (2) a genuineadmiration on  the part of the Japanese  ruling classes  for the  kind  of democraticmonarchy which presides over the British Empire.  The former of these two factorshas led to a  certain  degree of  co-operation between Japan  and Great Britain inChina, especially since the Nanking outrages proved that all  foreign interests theremust stand or  fall together. It was after these outrages that the Japanese followedour example by despatching a defence force to Shantung Province; this force was,however, withdrawn after three or four  months.   But  our policy in China is not really identical with that of Japan.  We wish to see China  united and prosperousand purchasing the maximum quantity of high-grade British  goods;  Japan doesnot desire too united or too prosperous a China. The present China, with low customsduties permitting a big  sale of Japanese low-grade goods, suits Japan very well.Japan,  too, would like  to see  rather  less of British influence in  China  and acorresponding increase of Japanese influence.  Further,  there is Manchuria, whereJapan wishes to expand  in the face of Russian opposition and Chinese  obstruction;this is a special Japanese  problem, in which we  have little or no concern.  It maylead to  increased friction between Japan and Russia; or it may lead  to increasedintimacy between  the  two countries for protection of their  mutual interests.  58. The most  striking  evidence of Japanese  appreciation of  British life  and institutions was the sending in 1925 of His Imperial Highness Prince Chichibu, theEmperots brother, to finish his education in this country.  In  1924-owing to theAmerican Immigration Law and to His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision to  proceedwith the Singapore naval  base the popularity  of Great Britain in  Japan was ata low ebb; but since that date, partly owing to Prince Chichibu&apos;s visit and partly to the events in China, we seem to have become better appreciated.  59. The prestige of Japan has certainly suffered an almost catastrophic deflationsince the days of her wartime prosperity.  The economic slump,  the discontinuationof  the alliance, the great earthquake, and now,  more recently, the financial crisis of 1927, have-revealed Japan&apos;s weakness  to the eyes of the world, and perhaps stillmore to the eyes  of  the Japanese.   In  1925, Sir Charles Eliot reported  that he considered that Japan was now a weak  Power.   In 1926 Sir  John Tilley wrote:&quot; I feel able to say that  Japan should not be regarded as a menace to peace in any quarter, or as  likely to be a protagonist in any great world  movement; her role, Ibelieve, will for many years yet be  only secondary.&quot;   It  should  be remembered,however,  that her geographical position renders her almost unattackable; and thather admirable  army and navy are by far the strongest  factor  in the Far  Easternposition if Japan should  ever  decide to make  full use  of them.   It  will be HisMajesty&apos;s Governments  policy to strive to retain the friendship of Japan, and so far
as possible to co-ordinate our policy in China with the justifiable claims of Japanfor special consideration.  It is to be hoped that Japan will deal equally loyally andconsiderately by us, but that is more doubtful                                    SIAM.   60.  By a declaration of the 15th January, 1896, Great Britain and France eachbound themselves not to advance  armed forces into Siam,  except with  the consentof the other, and not to acquire any special  privilege  or advantage which shall notbe equally enjoyed by both countries.  This was,  however, without prejudice to anyagreed action  for the purpose  of upholding the independence  of  Siam.   GreatBritain and France also engaged not to enter into separate agreements permitting a third  Power to take  any action  from which,  by the  declaration  in  question, they themselves were bound to abstain.   61.  A general treaty and a treaty of commerce and navigation between this countryand Siam were signed on  the 14th  July,  1925, and  ratifications have now been exchanged.  These two treaties mark the  opening of  a new era in Anglo-Siameserelations.  The general treaty  gives Siam  full  jurisdictional autonomy, and the-commercial treaty gives her fiscal autonomy.   In both  cases, however, there arecertain safeguards.   A protocol is annexed to the general treaty providing that,.pending the enforcement of the Siamese codes, now in preparation,  and for five yearsthereafter, His Majesty&apos;s  diplomatic and consular  officials  may evoke any casepending in any Siamese court, except the Supreme Court, in which a British subject is involved and dispose of it themselves in accordance with English law.  An article of the commercial treaty stipulates that the articles of principal interest to british trade with Siam, namely,  cotton yarns, threads, fabrics, and all other manufacturesof cotton, iron  and steel,  and  manufactures thereof,  and machinery and  parts thereof, manufactured in any of His Majesty&apos;s territories  to  which  the  treatyapplies, shall not, on importation into  Siam, be  subjected to any  customs duty inexcess of 5 per cent, ad valorem during the first ten years after the coming into forceof the treaty.  62.  Relations between.the two countries are cordial.   British trade with Siam hasbeen longer established and  is  larger in volume than that of any other country, andmore than 50,000 Indian British subjects are resident  in Siam.                  YII. NORTH  AND SOUTH AMERICA.                             UNITED STATES.                             NAVAL COMPETITION.  63. The danger to good relations arising out of naval competition, which it was hoped had been  to  ail intents  and  purposes removed by the  conclusion  of  theWashington Naval Treaty, again became perceptible with the opening of 1927 owingto the intensive propaganda by &quot; Big Navy &quot; and unfriendly elements in the UnitedStates for the construction of a large cruiser force alleged to be required for  thepurpose of obtaining &quot; parity &quot; with this country. This danger was accentuated bythe failure of the Geneva  Naval Conference, which was  held  at the invitation ofthe United States Government for the purpose of further limiting naval armamentsby the extension of the 5:5:3 ratio agreed upon at Washington in 1921 for capital ships so as to cover all  classes of war vessels.  It is not necessary here to go into  the causes which led to the failure of this conference.  It will suffice to say that it gave rise to  considerable  resentment in the  United  States, and may be  regarded as responsible for the subsequent decision of the President to support the demands ofthe General Board of the United States Navy for a large building programme.  Whileit appears likely that the Naval question will prove to be a problem of some difficultyduring the next few years, the relative lack of success which has attended the efforts of interested parties in the United States to  arouse any real  wave  of anti-british feeling on the subject, justifies a hope that the problem may not prove to be insoluble.  64. Nevertheless, it must be frankly admitted that, as long as the element of veilednaval competition exists^j-elations are unlikely to improve and may, indeed, graduallydeteriorate.  Commercial and financial competition is a necessary and a permanentevil, but its effects are only likely to become serious if an acute and determined naval
competition is superimposed. The situation has certain analogies with that existingas between Great Britain and Germany before the war, and for this reason needscareful watching.  But there are also certain fundamental differences, chief of whichis the fact that the American people is, as a whole, pacific in its outlook.  In thewords  of Admiral Rodgers, United States of America,  &quot; the United  States  ispeaceably and benevolently, although somewhat arrogantly, disposed towards therest of the world.&quot;                           WAR CLAIMS AGREEMENT.   65. If the failure of the Geneva Conference did nothing to improve Anglo-american relations, the conclusion on the 19th  May, 1927, of an  agreement with that countryfor the mutual liquidation of all  claims originating during the war 1914-18 can onlybe described as most fortunate  and  useful.  In 1925  it became apparent that theUnited States Government were contemplating the presentation of a large numberof so-called claims against Great Britain arising from the detention of United Statesmerchant vessels and cargoes during the  blockade of Germany.  Such an event wouldhave been definitely detrimental to the good relations between the two  countries,chiefly on account of the unfortunate effect  which the  presentation of these warclaims would have had upon public  opinion  in Great  Britain.  In 1926, however,negotiations were carried on quietly and without any  measure  of publicity both in washington and in London, which led to the removal of this menace and the mutualsettlement of many other claims, without either Government being called upon tomake any actual payment to the other. It is satisfactory to be able to add that, sincethe agreement was concluded,  the United States  Government have  shown everydisposition to deal as  rapidly  as  possible with certain minor  British claims not included within its scope which  have been pending for some time, and generally to live up to the spirit as well as to the letter of the agreement.                 UNITED STATES POLICY IN THE CARIBBEAN AREA.   66. According to information supplied  in confidence to His  Majesty&apos;s ChargedAffaires at Port-au-Prince, the United States Government either have  concludedor are  about to conclude a secret agreement with the Government of Hayti,  underwhich the United States will be authorised to fortify certain selected points in Hayti,and the Haytian Government will establish a military force (recruited it is alleged byconscription) to be  commanded by  United States officers.  This  alleged  secretagreement, however, only represents  an extension of an already existing state ofaffairs.  Under the  Treaty of 1915 between Hayti and  the United States,  the latteralready exercise  a large measure  of control  in  Hayti, while  American officerscommand the Haytian gendarmerie.                    PAN-AMERICAN  CONFERENCE AT HAVANA.   67. The Vlth International Conference of  American States,  otherwise known asthe Pan-American Conference, opened in Havana, Cuba, on the 16th January andterminated on  the  21st February last.   Great importance was attached to this conference by the  United  States Government, who,  for  some time prior  to itscommencement, had not been able  to  conceal  their apprehension over the  spread of anti-Americanism in South America, as reflected  by a distinct fall in the volumeof their  trade with their Latin-American neighbours.   Consequently, not only wasthe conference inaugurated by  President Coolidge in person,  but a very strongUnited States delegation, headed by Mr. Charles E. Hughes, late Secretary of State,attended.   68. The conference resulted in a great personal  triumph for  Mr. Hughes,  whoseskilful  diplomacy successfully prevented  any extended discussion  upon political matters reflecting upon the United States, such as the question of the right of one country to intervene in the internal affairs of another  (Nicaragua).  On more thanone. occasion, however,  disagreeable wrangles were only avoided with the utmostdifficulty, and in this connexion  it is worthy of note that Dr.Pueyrredon, ArgentineAmbassador  at  Washington and  head  of the Argentine  delegation, caused some embarrasment to the  United States delegation, not only in the matter  of inter-vention, but also as regards the question of inter-American tariffs.   Dr. Pueyrredonappears, indeed, to have exceeded his instructions, and the attitude which he adopted    (&apos;7987)
led eventually to his resigning not only his leadership of the Argentine delegation,but also his post at Washington.   69. One purpose of the United States Government was probably to show that theyare not in any sense behind the League of Nations in their desire to promote peace by the preparation and conclusion of international  conventions.   Amongst the numerous  draft conventions, resolutions,  &amp;c, approved by the conference, perhaps the most  important was that  dealing with maritime neutrality, and a resolutionapproving the principle of  compulsory arbitration  of  international disputes and providing  for a conference to be held in Washington within the next twelve months to consider how this may best be carried out,  as  well as  to  define the limits ofarbitrable  questions.   The  draft convention on maritime neutrality  recognises the right  of search on the high  seas  and establishes  that commercial vessels:may only  be attacked in the event of their refusing, after having been  stopped,to obey instructions, and may not  be disabled until  passengers  and crew  havebeen  removed   to   a  place of  safety.    The   treaty  also   lays  down  certainrules  regarding the  provision of war material to belligerents,  and  finally classifiesarmed merchant vessels  as ships of war.   This classification was strongly  objected;to by the United States and Cuba, who agreed to the treaty with reservations.  70.  According to information received, it may be  said that  while the successfulmanoeuvring of the United States delegation has been received by their compatriotswith a chorus of acclamation, there is little doubt but that the  conference failed inits primary  purpose, namely,  the creation of better feeling  towards the  UnitedStates on the part of Latin America in general.    Foreign Office, April 5, 1928.                       SECTION 2 TO ANNEXUEE  1.   Copy of a Letter from the Permanent Under-Seeretary of State for Dominion A flairs.                                     Dominions Office., Downing Street, S.W.1,My dear. Hankey,                                  March 14,  1928.

There are possibilities, although fortunately remote, of trouble in British Guianain connexion with the change in the Constitution now being made.(2.) Ceylon, Mauritius, Seychelles.    As regards Ceylon there is no change.    The  despatch  from  the  Governor  of Mauritius referred  to  in last  year&apos;smemorandum has been received.  He states  that &quot;there are no  serious sources  of danger at present, but the position may, of course, change in the future.&quot;  efforts are being made to revive public enthusiasm and to make efficient the local VolunteerForce which at present exists practically only on paper.    A scheme of Police  Cadets has been started in the Police Force,  designed  to attract a good type of recruit for the eventual  strengthening of the commissionedranks.    A copy of a memorandum by the  Inspector-General of Police forwarded withthe Governors despatch is attached.    The Governor of the Seychelles has been invited to consider the formation of a-small Local Force (about 25 men with automatic weapons).  Such a force is intendedprimarily  for defence against sea-borne raids but would be available for use in theunlikely contingency of internal trouble.(3.) Hong Kong and Malaya.    The position in Hong Kong is more favourable.  The boycott by Canton has notbeen renewed.  The Communists have been  crushed in Canton,  though not in  allother parts of Kuang Tung.  Li Chai Sum the present ruler of Canton proposes veryfriendly feelings towards Hong Kong and steps have been taken by him  to curbthe power of some of the Labour Unions.   He has also promised to deal with thepirates, whose activities  have  in any case  been much diminished since the burningof their lairs in Bias Bay.  His position, however, is far from being assured.   Armiesbelonging  to rival leaders are still in being in other parts of the Province.    The normal garrison of 2 Battalions should be adequate for purposes of internal security.    In Malaya there has  been no recurrence of disturbances by Chinese.    The present Governor regards the riot which occurred in the spring of  1927  asdue largely to injudicious police arrangements and does not think that the Chineseconstitute  a  serious  danger.    This is  confirmed by a report  by the  RussianCommunists, obtained by a secret  agent, which  confesses failure  of subversivepropaganda in Malaya.  In present circumstances the existing garrison is sufficientto secure  internal security.(4.) West Africa.    In Nigeria there  are  evidences of  religious agitation  from time to time amongthe Moslem population,  but it is thought that  a  serious disturbance  is unlikely.The local  forces here and in the other West African Colonies should be capable  ofdealing with any movement that might be expected.  This position will not be altered by the forthcoming disbandment of the West African Regiment.(5.) East Africa:    The Kenya Defence Force Ordinance has been  passed and will enter into forceshortly. A Staff Officer has been engaged for the Force and has left for Kenya.    Otherwise the position is unchanged.(G.) Middle East.    Iraq. It was  stated in last year&apos;s  memorandum that  there was a possibility that disturbances might occur in Iraq in connection with the question whether Iraqshould enter the League of Nations in 1928, consideration of which was provided forin Article 3 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926.       [17987]       &quot;                       .                          E
     This matter came up for discussion in connection with the negotiation of theAnglo-Iraq Treaty of the 14th December, 1927, and it was then agreed that, subjectto certain provisos, His Majesty&apos;s Government would support  the candidature ofIraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932.   This decision, which wasembodied in Article 8 of the new Treaty, has caused a certain amount of resentmentamong the more vocal  elements in Iraq, but has not given rise to any disturbances.This possible source of trouble may now, therefore, be  regarded  as eliminated.     In the latter part  of last year, during the absence  of King Faisal and the HighCommissioner in this country, the sectarian  feeling between Shiahs and Sunnis inIraq became somewhat acute, and for a.few months it  appeared that the grievancesof the Shiahs  might  constitute  a danger to  public  security.  On the return  of king Faisal and the High Commissioner to Iraq and upon the  signature of thenew Treaty the tension gradually relaxed and there is no reason to anticipate serious trouble on this score in  the immediate future.   The possibility of  further troublebetween  these two sects cannot, however, be altogether ignored.     The  recent  raids  by Akhwan  tribesmen  upon  Iraq,  regarding  which  theCabinet  is fully informed, may possibly, if they continue on  a serious  scale, re-actupon the internal security of Iraq. Already the greater part of one Iraq tribe, theDhafir, have embraced the Wahabi faith and  gone over  to Nejd.   The importanttribe of the Anizeh, upon whom the security of the trans-desert route largely depend,are  reported to be wavering, but special  efforts are  being  made  to restore their confidence and to prevent a further secession.     Trans-Jordan. It is probable that, in the event of raids being made on Trans-Jordan by Akhwan tribesmen, the sympathies of the population of Maan would be with the  raiders.  That population for a large part consists of past employees of theHedjaz  Railway, who  have  tools which would enable them to  break railway communications.     The  dispositions of  the forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan have, therefore,been reviewed, and in  present circumstances  there is no reason  to think that those forces would not be able to deal  with any internal disturbances likely to  occur  inTrans-Jordan.     Colonial Office,  March 24, 1928,                     APPENDIX TO ENCLOSURE TO SECTION 3.         Memorandum by the  Inspector-General of Police at Mauritius.    Mauritians of all social grades are highly emotional and perhaps hyper-sensitivewith regard to questions of local politics, colour, honour, national characteristics, &amp;c,and, if agitated,  ignored  or offended in these respects, by accident or design, theirfeelings are likely to run away with them and cause serious results.    The danger-spots at the moment are the colour question (as between white and coloured Mauritians),  development of the trade union system and strike weaponamongst the labouring classes, and,  in  a slight degree, hostility of  the  whiteMauritians to the political awakening of the Indians.   There is  also a deep-seatedhostility of the poorer class of coloured Creoles against the alien Chinese shop-keepers, who are  always subject to attack in times of public excitement, as occurred,for instance, on the occasion of  the Armistice.    There is thus always the possibility of internal disorder in  Mauritius for theabove reasons, but, in my opinion, little probability of anything of a serious nature.

Thank you for your letter of the 6th March, No. I.D./K./20,* enclosing a copyof Paper  C.O.S. 97.  &apos; I enclose a memorandum  covering the changes which havetaken place in the situation as regards India, since the last Annual Review of theDefence Situation.                                                     Yours sincerely,                                                             A.  HIRTZEL.    Lieut.-Col. Sir M. P. A. Hankey, G.C.B.,             Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence,                  2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.                   ENCLOSURE TO SECTION 4  TO ANNEXURE 1.                         Memorandum by the India Office.1.  Defence of India Sub-Committee.    The Defence of India Sub-Committee of the Committee  of Imperial  Defenceconcluded their  deliberations  on  the subject of Afghanistan, and submitted their first  Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 158-D) on the  19th  December,  1927.   TheCommittee of Imperial Defence considered the Report at their 232nd Meeting, onthe 26th January, 1928, and agreed-    &quot; (a.) To approve the Conclusions contained therein, which were summarised as*ollows :      (1.)  The material consequences of any substantial Russian  encroachment into          Afghanistan would be no less dangerous to India, and no less disastrous          to our general interests at the present time than they were in the past.          The question  of the policy to be adopted  in the event of  such encroach-          ment turns on whether we have the military power to enforce it.    (2.)  To approve in principle the plan which has been drawn up by the Chief          of the Imperial General Staff in consultation with  the Chief of the Air          Staff; and,  in particular, to endorse the conception of the execution of          the operations on the southern line  of advance in Afghanistan by means          of mechanised and air  forces.    (3.)  In  so much as  the above plan  holds  out a reasonable  prospect that  the          northern frontier  of Afghanistan  can be. recovered by  direct military          action, provided that our antecedent preparation is adequate, and that          the Empire is prepared to make the necessary effort, to adopt,  mutatis          mutandis, the reafnrmation of the principle enunciated by Lord Balfour          in 1903,  and endorsed by Lord Morley&apos;s Committee in 1907, &apos; that,  by          our own plain interest, our obligations to guard the  independence and          integrity of Afghanistan are unimpaired, and that the deliberate crossing          of the Oxus or the occupation  of Herat by Russia would be the violation          of a  frontier  which we are bound  to defend.&apos;   Also, following Lord          Morley&apos;s  Committee, to assume that, in the last resort, &apos; Russian action          of the kind  indicated would be followed by a declaration of  war against        .... that  Power.&apos;   (4.)  The Chief of the Imperial General staff should, in consultation with the       &apos;  Chief of the Air Staff and the  General Staff in India,  elaborate his plan          in full detail, showing what is contemplated at each stage during the first          year of a war, on the assumption that               (a.) A violation of the frontier of Afghanistan of such  a nature as          to constitute a casus belli had,  in fact, taken place.              (b.) Conscription would not be enforced during the first year of war,          but that up to 250,000 men of good quality would be obtained by voluntary          methods in the first three months after the outbreak  of war.[17987]* Not printed.
 (5.) None of the operations which can be undertaken in other parts of the world       appear likely to be productive of decisive,  or even  of  very  important,       results;  but the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should continue  their       examination of this problem. , (6.) To commend the whole question of the preparedness of the Army and Royal       Air Force in India to the serious consideration of  the Government of       India.  In this connection, subject to any decision that may later be taken       on the wider question of whether India pays  too much or too little of the       cost of Empire defence, India&apos;s responsibility for preparing,  in  time of       peace, for the problems dealt with in this Report, will be discharged if       her forces and their equipment are brought up  to a scale adequate for       war with Afghanistan and the tribes of the North-west frontier,  or to       enable India to co-operate with the Imperial forces,  in accordance with       the role assigned to her by agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;       and the Government of India,  in the greater  contingency of  war with       Russia in defence of India. (7.) A friendly Afghanistan being a. primary condition of the military plans       referred to in 2 above,  it is important that any opportunities  of  further       improving our relations with Afghanistan should be taken, if possible.       Some of the measures which might be adopted to  that end are :            (a.)  Definite acceptance of the principle of assistance to Afghanistan       in the development of road and telegraphic communications with India.           (&amp;.)  Assistance, both expert and financial,  in  the  construction of       railways (see also Conclusion No. 10 below).           (c.) Assistance in establishing Exchange Banks  in  Afghanistan.           (d.)  Assistance in reorganising the Customs and Post and Telegraph       Departments in Afghanistan.           (e.) The establishment and maintenance  of  a  civil Air  Service       between Kabul and Peshawar, conducted by British pilots, and subsidised       by the Government of India.(8.) There would be much advantage in            (a.) The substitution of Englishmen for Indians in our Consulates       at Kandahar and J alalabad; and           (&amp;.) The establishment of Consulates, with British officers in  charge,       at Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.(9.) The strengthening of the Afghan Army in peace would on the whole be to       our advantage.  The Government of India should be invited to submit       recommendations on this question.   Further, the measures whereby the       Afghan Army could be supported and  strengthened in  the event of the       emergency dealt with in this Report, should be pre-determined.(10.) As regards railway construction in Afghanistan :            (a.) On the whole we may regard railway extension in Afghanistan,       provided that it  takes  the right form,  at  least with  equanimity, if not       with satisfaction.           (b.) Our Minister  at Kabul should be instructed not to make the       first move in this matter, even to the extent of encouraging the King of       Afghanistan to broach  the subject.  When, and if, the King  does so of       his own accord, our Minister should receive the proposal sympathetically,       ascertain his intentions as fully as possible, and submit a detailed report       to His Majesty&apos;s  Government.           (c.) The programme of construction cannot be determined until the       KLing&apos;s wishes are known; but it appears desirable  that the extension from       Landi Khana to  Kabul should  be the first stage, and the linking up of       Chaman with Kandahar the second.   In any event,  the whole question       should be again examined in India  in  the light  of the findings  of  this      Report, in order that the strategical, commercial,  technical and financial       aspects of the various  alternatives&apos; may  be duly weighed  before  the       necessity for a decision arises.(11.) If it should be decided by the Cabinet that any public pronouncement of       policy is to be made, it should be couched  in language which leaves our       discretion unfettered. &apos;                  .    (&amp;.) That, after the minor amendments suggested by  the Viceroy had been incorporated, the Report should be submitted to the Cabinet.&quot;
    The Cabinet at a Meeting&apos;* held on the 22nd February, 1928, agreed &apos;,         &quot; That the question of the establishment of British Consuls in Northern    Afghanistan, involving, consequentially  the establishment  of Soviet Russian    Consuls in Southern Afghanistan, on which the views of the Indian  Government    are  at  variance with  the  recommendations of  the Sub-Committee  of the    Committee of Imperial Defence,  should be left to the decision of the Secretary    of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India.         That; subject  to  the  above,  the  report  of  the  Sub-Committee of the    Committee of Imperial Defence on the Defence of  India,  together with the    recommendations^  of  the Committee of  Imperial  Defence  thereon  (Paper    CP. 26 (28)), should be approved.&quot;    2.   As a  result of the correspondence between the Secretary of State for Indiaand the  Government  of India  on the subject of Afghanistan and the Defence ofIndia Sub-Committee, the Government of India have been considering the questionof bringing up-to-date and completing the technical equipment of the Army and theRoyal Air Force in India,    3.   With regard to anti-gas measures, the Government of India have recentlydecided  to  erect at  once  a  Respirator  Assembly  Factory  and  a  research establishment.

In reply to your secret letter of the 6th March (Reference I.D./K./20) I thinkit will be sufficient from the Home  Office point of view to say that  the situation is substantially the same as at the date of the last Review.  Industrial relations are if anything easier and there  is no indication of any  trouble likely to require theemployment of armed forces.   This  opinion is confirmed by the Ministry of Labour.                                                   Yours sincerely,                                                       JOHN  ANDERSON.

    The Joint Defence Committee,  as  requested last year by the Committee of chiefs of Staff, is rendering a separate Report on the position at defended ports athome and abroad, which covers some of the ground formerly included in the Summaryby the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    The Conclusions of the  Committee of Imperial Defence,  which are normally-dealt with in the Annual Report by the Co-ordination Committee, are not includedin this  Summary.  The matters left to  the Co-ordination Committee  include such questions as the work of the Man-Power Committee, the Principal Supply  Officers.Committee, Oil Board, Blockade, Censorship, Insurance in Time of War, and several other  matters relating  to administrative questions and  organisation  other than tothe strategical  side  of warfare.   In  some borderline cases  some overlap is-unavoidable.  II. -POLITICAL AND  STRATEGICAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR DEFENCE  PREPARATIONS.Military Commitments (on the- Continent of Europe).    2.   With regard to our military commitments on the Continent of Europe,  itwas stated in our First Annual  Review (OLD. Paper No. 701-B, paragraph (9))that         &apos;&apos; It follows that so far as commitments on the Continent are concerned the    Services can only  take  note of them.  No specific provision to meet them  is-    practicable,  other than the adoption of such measures of organisation, training    and equipment as are essential to enable them to  fight on the Continent  if    required.&quot;    Though these commitments still remain  unchanged,  the Cabinet, at a meetingheld on  the  28th July,  1927, approved the following formula as the basis of army estimates:         &quot; That  it should be assumed  for the purpose of  the Estimates  that the    British Empire will not be  engaged in an European war  during the next ten    years and that the  immediate plans  of  the Army  should  be based  upon    preparedness for an extra-European war.&quot;  (Cabinet 45 (27),  (v).)*    This formula was further amplified and made applicable to the three FightingServices at  the 236th  Meeting of the Committee  of Imperial Defence, when it wasagreed to  recommend    &quot; (a.) That it should be assumed, for the purpose of framing the Estimates of the           Fighting Services, that  at any given date there will be no major war for           ten years.    (b.) That this  assumption should be reviewed annually by the Committee  of           Imperial Defence before the Estimates of the Fighting Services are drawn           up, that is to say, not later than the month of  June, and that it shall be           the duty of the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence to remind           the Prime  Minister of this  Conclusion at the appropriate moment and           take his instructions as to placing the subject on the Agenda Paper of the           Committee.    (c.) That it shall be the duty of any Department in His Majesty\s Government           in Great Britain, no less than  the  right of the  Government of  any           Dominion, to ask the Committee of Imperial Defence to review the above           Conclusion  at any other &quot;time if, in the opinion of any of them, the cir-           cumstances had so changed as to render its application to the then existing           conditions doubtful.&quot;    These recommendations have since been approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 39 (28),Conclusion 10).* C.T.D. Paper No. S73-B.
Defence of India.    3.  The most important development in the work of the Committee of ImperialDefence, as affecting the political and strategical assumptions on which our defensive preparations are based, is the acceptance by the Committee  of Imperial Defence onthe 26th January, 1928 (232nd Meeting), and by the Cabinet  on 22nd February, 1928(Cabinet 11 (28), Conclusion 4), of the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Defence  *of India, the  Conclusions of which are summarised in the Minutes of the Committeeof Imperial Defence in the following terms : -   &quot;(1.) The  material consequences of any substantial  Russian encroachment into          Afghanistan would be no less dangerous to India, and no less disastrous          to our general interests at the present time than they were in the past.          The question of the policy to be adopted in the  event of such encroach-          ment turns  on whether  we  have  the  military power  to  enforce  it.          (Paragraphs 30-35.)    (2.) To approve in principle the plan which has been drawn up by the Chief          of the Imperial General Staff in consultation with the Chief of the Air          Staff; and, in particular, to endorse the conception of the execution of          the operations on  the southern line of advance in Afghanistan by means          of mechanised and air forces.   (Paragraphs 36-40.)    (3.) Insomuch  as  the  above plan holds  out  a  reasonable prospect that the          northern frontier of Afghanistan can be recovered by direct military          action,  provided that  our antecedent preparation is adequate, and that          the  Empire is prepared to make the necessary effort to adopt, mutatis          mutandis,  the reaffirmation of the principle enunciated by Lord Balfour          in 1903, and endorsed by Lord Morley&apos;s Committee in 1907,  &apos; that,  by           our own plain interest, our obligations to guard the  independence and          integrity of Afghanistan are unimpaired, and that the deliberate crossing          of the Oxus or the occupation of Herat by Russia would be the violation          of a frontier which we are bound to defend.&apos;   Also, following Lord          Morley&apos;s Committee, to assume that, in the last  resort, &apos; Russian action          of the kind indicated  would be followed by a declaration of war against          that Power.&apos;  (Paragraphs 41-42.)

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should, in consultation with the           Chief of the Air Staff and the General Staff in India, elaborate his plan           in full  detail, showing what is contemplated  at each stage during the           first year of a war, on the assumptions that            (a)  a violation of the frontier of  Afghanistan  of  such a nature as  to                 constitute a casus belli had, in fact, taken  place;           (b)  conscription would not be enforced.during the first year of war, but                 that up to 250,000  men of  good quality would be obtained by                 voluntary methods in the first three months after the outbreak of                 war.   (Paragraphs 43-44.)    (5.) None of the operations which can be undertaken in  other parts of the world           appear  likely  to  be productive of decisive,  or even of very  important,           results; but the  Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee should continue their           examination of this problem.  (Paragraph 45.)    (6.) To commend the  whole question of the preparedness of the Army and Royal           Air  Force in  India to the serious  consideration of the Government  of           India.   In this connection, subject to  any  decision that may later  be           taken on the wider question of whether India pays too much or too little           of the  cost of Empire defence, India&apos;s responsibility for preparing,  in           time of peace, for the  problems  dealt with in  this Report,  will  be           discharged if  her forces  and their equipment  are brought up to a scale           adequate  for war with Afghanistan and the tribes of the North-west           frontier, or to enable India to co-operate with  the Imperial forces,  in           accordance with  the. role  assigned to her  by agreement  between  His           Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government  of India,  in  the greater           contingency  of  war  with  Russia  in  defence  of  India.    (Para-           graphs  46-49.).     (7.) A friendly Afghanistan being a primary condition of the military. plans           referred to in  (2)  above, it is important that any  opportunities of further
           improving our relations with Afghanistan should be taken,  if possible.           Some of the measures which might be adopted to that end are :            (a.)  Definite acceptance of the principle of assistance to Afghanistan in                 the development of road and telegraphic  communications with.                 India.           (&amp;.)  Assistance, both expert and financial, in the construction of railways                 (see also Conclusion No. 10 below).           (p.)  Assistance in establishing Exchange Banks in Afghanistan.           (d.)  Assistance in  reorganising the Customs and Post  and&apos; Telegraph                 Departments in Afghanistan.           (e.)  The establishment and maintenance of a civil Air Service between                 Kabul and Peshawar,  conducted by British pilots, and subsidised                 by the Government of  India.  (Paragraphs 50-53.)    (8.) There  would be much advantage in            (a) the substitution of Englishmen for Indians in  our  Consulates  at                 Kandahar and Jelalabad;  and           (b) the establishment of Consulates,  with  British officers in charge,  at                 Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.   (Paragraph 54.)    (9.) The strengthening of the Afghan Army in peace would, on the whole,  be           to our advantage. The Government of India should be invited to  submit           recommendations on this question.  Further,  the measures whereby  the           Afghan Army  could be supported and strengthened  in the event of  the           emergency  dealt with  in   this   Report  should  be  predetermined.           (Paragraphs 55-57.)            .   (10.) As regards railway construction in Afghanistan :            (a.)  On the whole we may. regard railway extension in Afghanistan, pro-                 vided  that it takes the right form,  at least with equanimity, if                 not with satisfaction.           (&amp;.)  Our Minister at  Kabul  should be instructed not  to make the first                 move in this matter, even to the extent of encouraging the King               ;  of  Afghanistan to broach the subject.  When,  and if, the King                 does so of his own accord, our Minister should  receive the proposal                 sympathetically, ascertain his intentions as fully as possible, and                 submit a detailed report to His Majesty&apos;s Government.           (c.) The programme  of  construction  cannot be determined  until  the                 King&apos;s wishes are  known;  but it appears  desirable  that  the                 extension from Landi  Khana to Kabul should be  the  first stage,                 and the linking-up of Chaman with Kandahar the second.  In any                 event, the whole question should be again examined in India in the                 light of  the findings of this Report,  in order that the strategical,                 commercial, technical and financial aspects of  the various alterna-                 tives may be duly weighed  before  the necessity  for  a decision                 arises.   (Paragraphs 58-70.)   (11.) If it should be decided  by the  Cabinet  that any public pronouncement  of           policy is to be made,  it should be couched in language which leaves our           discretion  unfettered.  (Paragraph 71.)&quot;    The above  Conclusions were approved by the Cabinet, subject to the followingminor amendment:    &quot; (d.) That the question  of the establishment of  British Consuls in Northern           Afghanistan,  involving  consequentially  the establishment  of  Soviet           Russian Consuls in Southern Afghanistan, on which the views  of the           Indian Government are at variance with the recommendations of the Sub-           Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, should be left to the           decision of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary           of State for India.&quot;    4.   In  an  interim  Memorandum,  prepared  in  connection  with the annual review for 1927 (C.I.D. Paper No.  811-B, dated the 28th June,  1927),  the  Chiefsof Staff asked  for guidance as  to  whether  they would be  right in assuming  an
 aggression by Russia into Afghanistan or elsewhere against British interests as one of those contingencies to which a high order of priority should be given in military preparation.  The Committee of  Imperial Defence, however (229th Meeting), were unable to give any guidance pending receipt of the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Defence of India.  In paragraph 26 of that Report (C:I.D. Paper No. 158-D), the matter is referred to in the following terms :          &quot;  In these circumstances we have, for the purposes of this enquiry, adopted     a military assumption, which probably errs on the side of prudence, namely,     that Russia if and when she decides on aggressive action-must be  reckoned,     at any rate numerically,  as  a first-class ^military  Power.   At the same time,     Sir Robert Hodgson has told us that, although the Soviet Government is obsessed     by the fear&apos;of encirclement,  it &apos; has  at the present  time neither the will nor the     capacity to take aggressive action.&apos;   We accept this view,  and its implications     that the danger from that  quarter  is not imminent;  and we have  therefore     adopted the further assumption  that we may count on  a time margin in which     to complete our-precautionary measures and perfect our plans.   Nevertheless,     matters like army  organisation and railway  construction  are  not  processes     capable of  summary  despatch;  and it is therefore important that our general     policy  on  these and  other  cognate  questions  should  be  determined without.     unnecessary delay.&quot;     5.   The following  passage from the Foreign Office appreciation (Paper No. C.O.S.-139) also bears on this question :          &quot;It  seems most  probable that Russia will not be  in a position for many     years to wage war on a considerable scale outside the boundaries of the  Union of     Soviet  Socialist Republics.  The action  which is to be  feared from her (apart     from her persistent anti-British propaganda)  is that of gradual extension of     her influence in directions which affect British interests.&quot;     6.   These extracts are given in case, in their Annual Report  for 1928, the Chiefs of Staff may desire to recommend to the Committee of Imperial Defence the position which the Defence of India should occupy in the order of priority. China.                    -     7.   It  will be remembered  that, for the purposes  of their Second  Annual Review, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee were instructed by the  Committee of Imperial Defence to make the following assumption  as regards the length of time for which abnormal forces were likely to be required in the Far East: -         &quot; China. The situation  in China is so uncertain that  no reliable forecast    can be made as to how long it may be necessary to retain the Shanghai Defence    Force in China.  Moreover, it is the intention of the Government to reduce the    strength of this force as  and when  opportunity offers.  Subject to this, the    Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee should base their review on the assumption that    it might be necessary to retain British forces in China until the 31st March, 1928,    or even the 31st March, 1929,  and  plans should be  worked out for either    alternative, bearing in mind  the possibility of reducing the number of troops    by the employment either of passive defences or mechanised  forces.&quot;             (C.I.D. Paper No. 831-B.)    8.  The policy of gradually reducing the Imperial  forces in China, which was referred to  in the Second Annual Review (para. 5)  has since been pursued so far as circumstances have permitted.  Thus  the  Cabinet, on the 23rd November,  1927 (Cabinet 57 (27), Conclusion 6), on the recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff Sub- Committee  (C.I.D. Paper No.  832-B, para.  7), endorsed by a  Cabinet Committee (Paper C.P.-245 (27)), approved the despatch  of a telegram to  Sir Miles Lampsqn informing him that, in  view of the recommendations of the British authorities in. China, no further considerable reduction of  British  forces  in China  was contem- plated, but explaining that, as those forces could not be maintained indefinitely in China, preparations for an ultimate reduction should be made,  and that with thisobject the question of the raising of a local international  force in Shanghai should be further  explored and pressure brought Upon the Shanghai Municipal Council  to share the burden of the defence of the Settlement.  At the same time the War Office
was asked to consider whether the Shanghai  Defence Force could be numerically-reduced  by the substitution for man-power of mechanical  devices (C.I.D. Power,No. 850-5 (para. 12).     9.   In pursuance of this policy, the remaining half Battalion of Royal Marineswas withdrawn in the autumn in accordance with a decision taken in the previousAugust.  More recently, the Coldstream Guards were withdrawn in accordance witha Cabinet decision of the 25th January, 1928 (Cabinet 3 (28), Conclusion 6), and atthe same time authority was given, on the completion of the voyage, to dispense withthe transport &quot; Assaye,&quot; hitherto retained in Far Eastern waters.     10.   Similarly,  on the 17th February, 1928, the Cabinet  approved an Admiraltyproposal to withdraw the Third Destroyer Flotilla from China about the beginning ofMay, provided the political situation permitted  (Cabinet 8 (28), Conclusion 2).  But,in view of the breakdown of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s negotiations for a settlement of theNanking affair,  the Naval Commander-in-Chief was, on the  28th March, givendiscretion (subject to the concurrence of the British Minister at  Peking,  and, in thecase of  the garrison  at Nanking or  other local  forces, of  the General  OfficerCommanding), to retain any  forces destined  for  withdrawal  which  he  deemed necessary for the fulfilment of his  responsibilities (Cabinet 16 (28), Conclusion 5).Arrangements have since been made for the Flotilla to leave the China Station on or about the 15th May, on the understanding that another  Flotilla will arrive on theStation  before the  15th October, if  the  Naval  Commander-in-Chief  deems this necessary.Egypt.     11.   There has  been no discussion at the Committee  of Imperial Defence or itsSub-Committees,  or at the Cabinet, which affects the Conclusion  of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the 14th July, 1927 (229th Meeting, Minute 2), that          &quot;The Committee of  Chiefs  of  Staff should assume that the situation  in     Egypt is unlikely tp undergo such a change during the next  year as will require     any addition to the&apos;present garrison.&quot;Since the breakdown of the Treaty negotiations, however,  the situation in Egypt hasobviously become one which the Chiefs of Staff must have in mind.Man-Power and Principal  Supply Officers Committees--Basis of Enquiries.    12.  With reference to the original decisions  of the Chiefs of Staff relating tothe hypothetical contingencies  on which Supply preparations are to be based (seeC.O.S. 118,  paragraphs  13-15) the Principal Supply Officers  Committee represented that the hypotheses in question were not altogether suitable from  the point  of viewof preparations for industrial mobilisation.  They, therefore, asked that  they mightbe given one hypothetical contingency, and one only; and that  this contingency shouldbe a &quot; possible &apos;&apos;  war, which would make substantial demands distributed over all three Services.    The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee agreed as a basis for further discussion:    &quot; (a.)  That the hypothetical contingency to be given to  the Principal  Supply           Officers Committee should be war with Russia.     (&amp;.)  That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the  Chief  of the Air           Staff  should  send  to  the  Secretary  statements  showing the rates  of           expansion and the ultimate strengths of their  respective Services  during           the first year of war on the basis of a 50 per cent, expansion  on existing           strengths.     (c.)  That the Chief of the Naval Staff should send to the  Secretary a similar           statement as regards the&apos;Navy, his calculations being framed  on any           basis that he considered appropriate to the circumstances.     (d.)  That, with  reference to Conclusions (b) and (c) above, the forces that may           be forthcoming from the Dominions and India should not be included           in the estimates.    (e.)  That the above estimates should be considered by  the Chiefs  of Staff  in           Committee;  and that the desirability, or otherwise, of discussing these           hypotheses  with representatives  of  the  Principal Supply  Officers           Committee should be then determined.&quot;
                                                                                0 P *t                                     81Pending the estimates now being framed, however, Conclusion  (a) above should perhaps not be taken as indicating more than the trend of thought as to the mostsuitable basis for the enquiries of the Principal Supply Omcers Committee.    13.  In the secondary order of political developments which have  come beforethe Cabinet and the  Committee of Imperial Defence since the last Annual  Reviewmust be mentioned the difficulties with Ibn Saud on the southern frontier of Iraq(see paragraphs 32 and 33), and with the Imam on the Aden frontier (see paragraphs29 and 30), both of  which have  involved the  active employment of the Royal AirForce.                  III.-COAST DEFENCE AT HOME AND ABROAD.    14.  The  preparation of  a separate Memorandum  by the  Joint  DefenceCommittee (C.O.S.-145)  on this subject  renders  this  section of the Secretary&apos;sreview superfluous,                          IV. THE MEDITERRANEAN.The Haifa-Baghdad Railway and Pipe-Line Project.    15.  Apart from coast defence questions dealt with in  the Report of the joint defence Committee,- the most important question affecting the Mediterranean whichhas come before the Committee of Imperial Defence since the last Annual Review, itthe project for a railway and oil pipe-line from Baghdad to Haifa.    16.  On the 1st November,  1927 (at the  230th Meeting, at which the SecondAnnual Report of the Chiefs of Staff Committee was  approved), the Committee OfImperial Defence adopted the following resolutions :    &quot; (a.) That,, on strategical grounds, the construction of a railway from Baghdad           to Haifa  is desirable, provided that the western  portion of the line runs           entirely within British territory.    (b.)  That, from a military point of view, there are advantages in the standard           gauge, but its adoption is not essential.&quot;    17.   The whole question of the  proposed railway and pipe-line has since beenunder consideration by a Cabinet Committee, under the Chairmanship of the PrimeMinister, which has delegated further study of the subject to a special Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence under  the Chairmanship of Earl Stanhope.The question of the defence  of the  pipe-line has  been referred by  the Chiefs ofStaff  Sub-Committee to the Joint Planning Committee, and the defence of Haifa isnow before the Overseas Defence Committee.Egypt and the Suez Canal.    18.   As the result of a Report by the Chiefs of  Staff  Sub-Committee (C.I.D.Paper No. 834-B), progress has been made in  organising the detailed arrangementsfor the protection and security of the Suez Canal in time of war, under such headsas the Appointment of a Resident Naval Officer at Port Said, Minesweeping,  andthe Nationality of Pilots (231st Meeting, Minute 6). .  In particular,  a satisfactory response has been received from the  Suez Canal Company to representations madeby Sir Ian Malcolm,  one of the British Directors of the Company, in regard to thetwo latter points (234th Meeting, Minute 5, and C.I.D. Paper No. 863-B).    19.  The Committee of Imperial Defence were advised by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (231st Meeting, Minute 6),  that the installation of  fixed defenceswould conflict with the Suez Canal Convention  of  1888,  but that this would not applyto the storage in Egypt of a semi-mobile type of mounting.    20.  The question of semi-mobile mountings in Egypt forms part of the largerquestion  of the provision of  such mountings, which  is before the Joint DefenceCommittee.    .21.  The draft  Treaty of Alliance  between Great  Britain  and Egypt was examined  by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the 10th November,  1927, whenthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs attended a meeting to answer questions.The question is dealt  with in a Report by  the Chiefs of  Staff  (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 842-B), in which, after the replies of Sir Austen  Chamberlain to a number of
 detailed questions  had been  given,  the  general  position of  the  Chiefs of Staff Committee is set forth in the following terms :        (3.) Owing to the many purely political considerations involved, we feel we           can do no more than emphasize the very great importance  of the Suez           Canal as a vital link in our Imperial Communications and to point to           some of the consequences which any diminution in the security of this           link will entail. These consequences will not be confined to  measures in           or near  Egypt alone, but will  be spread  over a very wide area and will           affect almost every portion of  the Empire.  Should there be any risk of           free  communication  through  the Canal  being severed or  menaced, it,           follows  that our Naval forces on each side of  the Suez Isthmus  may           have to be regarded as self-contained and separate entities; for example,           Singapore may have to be strengthened  to  render it less dependent on           home supplies and support.               Apart from the actual  dispositions  of  our Naval forces,  it will  be           necessary to reconsider our cruiser,  destroyer and submarine strength.               Further,  the alternative  route  to the East,  via,  the  Cape,  will           immediately assume greater importance, with consequent increases to the           garrisons and  armaments of the essential bases lying along this route.           For example, it may become necessary to review the recent decision  in           regard to the defended port of Sierra Leone.               Lastly, the possible reactions on the scale of defences in the Overseas           Dominions of South Africa,  Australia, New Zealand and in India must           not be overlooked.    (4.) It is for His Majesty&apos;s  Government to decide whether  the increased  risk           to the security  of the Canal and the possible consequences, which may           result if article  7 and the annexe are approved in their  present form,           outweigh the political advantages which are claimed for the  Treaty.&quot;    22.  The draft Treaty has since been rejected by the Egyptian Government, andthis renders unnecessary the re-examination of the question of the Defence  of the suez Canal, which the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had been instructed to makein the event of the Treaty being signed (231st Meeting, Minute 6).The Sudan.    23.  A Squadron of  Royal Air  Force has been stationed at Khartoum since october, 1927, in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the recommendationof the Committee  of Imperial Defence, referred  to in paragraph 44  of the  lastSummary (Paper No. C.O.S.-118).    24.  The question of  the garrison of  the Sudan  will be due for re-examination in November, 1928, in accordance with the  Cabinefs decision (C.I.D./230th Meeting,Minute 8)..    25.  Since the last  Summary a Report has been received from  the FrenchGovernment regarding the  possibility of a Mahdist rising  in French equaltorial africa (C.I.D. Paper No. 839-B), and it  is understood that instructions  have nowbeen issued by the British and French Governments to their respective representatives on the spot for interchange of information on the subject (231st Meeting, Minute 12,and C.I.D. Paper No. 839-B).                            V.&apos; THE MIDDLE EAST.Palestine and the proposed Haifa^-Baghdad Railway.    26.  These have already been dealt with under the heading &quot;The Mediterranean&quot;&quot;(paragraph 15).                                 .               c Aden.    27.  The following important decisions taken by the Cabinet on the 6th October, 1927  (Cabinet  52  (27),  Conclusion 9), were taken  note of by  the  Committee  of Imperial Defence on the 19th December (231st Meeting, Minute 14) :    &quot; (a.)  That the responsibility for the defence of Aden should be transferred from           the War Office to the Air Ministry, and that in future the Air Estimates           should bear the cost of the expenditure involved ;
                                                                                 9 0 Q                                                                                 (J u o                                    .  33  -     (b.) That the future garrison should be based on proposal (d)  as set forth in           Paper CP.-250 (27), viz. :-               To reduce the garrison by                    One British Battalion,                   One Indian Battalion,                   The Aden Troop,                   A proportion of Ancillary Services,                   One Flight Royal Air Force:                       and               To add to the garrison                    One Squadron Royal Air Force,                   Three Armoured Cars,                   Tribal Forces  (400 to 500);     (c.) That the details should be worked out between the Air Ministry and the           War Office, who should keep in touch with the Colonial Office.     (d.) That^ while it is desirable to withdraw the British Battalion at the earliest           possible moment, partly  owing to the deplorable state of  the existing           barrack accommodation and partly in order to try and effect a saving in           the present financial year, the Departments concerned should have due           regard to the present difficulties of the local situation arising out of our           relations with the Imam.&quot;    28.  The question  of the Police Force at Aden has also  recently been  underconsideration by the Committee of Imperial  Defence and in accordance  with the irrecommendation a Cabinet  Committee was appointed to  consider the steps  whichshould be taken &quot;to  secure an efficient Police Force at Aden&quot; (Cabinet 30 (28),Conclusion 8).    The recommendations  of this  Committee  were approved by the  Cabinet(Cabinet 31 (28), Conclusion 4).    29.  The continued encroachment by Tribes under the control of the Imam ofYemen  into the  Aden  Protectorate, culminating in the  seizure of two  friendlySheikhs, led to the institution of operations by air.  These proved very effective andresulted in the Imam&apos;s  returning his captives and making approaches with a viewto a settlement.   On the 29th March,  1928L the Committee of Imperial Defence(234th Meeting, Minute 9) approved the despatch of the following telegram  to the resident at Aden :          &quot;Your  proposal for immediate negotiations of preliminary treaty with    Imam on lines advocated by you is approved.  If, however, there is difficulty    about  the precise extent of the evacuation of Aden territory which the  Imam    must carry out to enable us to agree to preliminary treaty, you will keep in mind    views  of Chiefs of Staff as to military undesirability of undue extension of our    territorial responsibility, and will therefore only insist on immediate  evacuation    of such minimum area as (a) you yourself regard as essential from the point of    view of our obligations to the tribes, and (b) you, in consultation with the Air    Officer Commanding, consider of importance from the point of view  of defence.    The final adjustment of the boundary outside this minimum area can then be left    to the subsequent detailed treaty.&quot;    30.  The Prime Minister authorised  the immediate despatch of this telegram,which was confirmed  by  the  Cabinet  on   the  18th April  (Cabinet 21  (28),Conclusion 11).                                  &apos;   1. &apos;.   :    The Imam asked for a postponement of  the negotiations and this request wasconsidered  by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their  235th Meeting on the22nd May,  1928, when it was agreed  to recommend to the Cabinet :     (a.) That the Imam&apos;s request  for a postponement of the negotiations until the           17th July should be granted, on the condition of his immediate  evacuation           of Dhala as an earnest of his good faith. :   -    (&amp;.) That the Foreign Office and Colonial Office in consultation should draft, for           the consideration of the Cabinet, a more precise explanation of. what we           were  prepared to do in  the matter of the  supply of war material within           the limits of our international obligations.
    (c.) That as regards the Imam&apos;s request  for compensation for  buildings, &amp;c.,.           in the areas he was to evacuate, a temporizing reply should be given.    These  recommendations were  subsequently approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet30 (28), Conclusion 9).  The Imam, however,.failed to eyacuate Dhala and bombingwas resumed.Turkey.    31.  In  regard to Turkey,  there are no developments to report since the last.Summary was issued.Iraq.    32. . Since the last Annual Report there has been serious unrest on the frontier between Iraq and  the Arabian territory  under the  rule of  Ibn  Saud, which necessitated operations by the Royal Air Force in Iraq.   There were  also threats to&apos;Koweit, and  a naval detachment was landed to co-operate in its defence.    The actual operations, however, have been conducted entirely by the  Royal AirForce.  Apart from the threat to Koweit there has been no question of joint action by the other  Services.  But in view of the negotiations  which were opened with.Ibn Saud  in order to remove  the  causes  of unrest, the  military and political aspects of  the problem have been.the subject of examination by the Committeeof Imperial Defence since May last. At the 235th Meeting (C.I.D., 235th Meeting,Conclusion 3), the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed, inter alia, to recommend to the Cabinet :-    (a.) That the  maintenance of Busaiyah and  certain other desert posts is           essential for the effective defence of Iraq by the existing garrison, and           that, therefore, it is impossible to give way to Ibn Saud on the principle           involved in this question.    (b.) That, subject to (a) above, it is most important that  Sir Gilbert Clayton           should be put  in a position to make an offer which will convince Ibn           Saud that we are doing our best to meet him in this matter.  With this           object, the Air Ministry should examine the whole  question of frontier           posts with a view to determining which are absolutely essential, and           which, if  any,  could be  dispensed with.  In presenting our case to Ibn           Saud, emphasis should be laid on  the moderation of our demands, for           example, in respect to the small number of posts in comparison with the           very  large length of  frontier..    The above  recommendations were approved by the  Cabinet (Cabinet 30 (28),.Conclusion 7); and negotiations were conducted accordingly. But Ibn  Saud provedunwilling to give way on the matter of posts;  negotiations were suspended, andSir Gilbert Clayton returned to England.  The question was again examined by aSub-Committee  of  the Committee  of Imperial Defence.   The  recommendations ofthis Sub-Committee after hearing  the views of Sir Gilbert Clayton  and. Air Vice-Marshal Sir  Edward Ellington (C.I.D.  Paper No. 895-B), were approved by theCabinet ;*  and  Sir  Gilbert Clayton has returned to resume conversations &apos; withIbn Saud.    33.  On  the 16th February, 1928, the Committee of Imperial Defence (233rdMeeting, Minute  1)  recommended that a revised  military agreement  with  Iraq(C.I.D. Paper No. 856-B) should be approved.   On the  7th  March  the Cabinetaccepted this&apos; recommendation  on  the  understanding that the normal cost of theIndian Battalions  in Iraq should  not fall on Army, Estimates (Cabinet  13 (28),Conclusion 3).Persian Gulf.    34.  A  Sub-Committee  of  the Committee  of  Imperial Defence,  under  theChairmanship of the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs,  has been  set up  toexamine our  policj&apos;- in the Persian Gulf in the  light of. the present position.  As the^result of the preliminary discussions of this Sub-Committee, certain questions on themilitary aspects of the problem have  been referred to  the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee for examination and Report.                            * Cabinet 37 (2-s), Conclusion 7.
                                  VI. INDIA.    35.  The Conclusions  of  the Cabinet  and Committee  of Imperial  Defenceresulting from the important inquiry by Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee into theDefence of India have already been given in full in paragraph 3.Subsidiary Operations against Russia.    36.  The feasibility of subsidiary operations against Russia, which was referredto in paragraph 67 of the  last Summary  (Paper No.  C.O.S.-118) has been  underconsideration by the Joint Planning Committee, and their Report has been submittedto the Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee.Economic Pressure on Soviet Russia.    37.  On  the 26th  January, 1928,  the  Committee  of  Imperial   Defence(232nd Meeting, Minute 4) approved a Report by the Advisory Committee on Tradingand Blockade in Time of War on the  subject of Economic Pressure on Soviet Russia(C.I.D. Paper No.  845-B),  the Conclusions of which are summarised as follows inthe last paragraph of the Report: *   &quot; (1.)  The Soviet Union is at present  obviously self-supporting  in regard to food           supplies.    (2.)  The Soviet Union requires few  raw materials which could be deemed vital           to  her existence, and  those  which are necessary, such  as rubber and           cotton, could continue  to  be  purchased  in neutral countries.    (3.)  Certain classes of machinery are necessary to develop Soviet industry,  but           could  and would no doubt be  supplied in increased quantities by foreign           competitors, chiefly German and American.    (4.)  Little,  if any, immediate economic effect  on the population of the Soviet           Union would result from a  partial cessation of  imports  of goods  for           personal consumption.    (5.)  Credit,  which is  essential  for the economic  recuperation of the Soviet           Union, seems to offer a possible point where pressure from outside would           be effective.  It  is  unlikely,  however, that the cutting-off of  financial           facilities by the British Empire alone could make this pressure effective.    (6.)  The Soviet Union is probably more dependent on the British market than           on that of any other country for the sale of her produce.               The loss of this market would probably make the disposal of Russian           exports a matter of some difficulty, at any rate, under the same favourable           credit conditions and in their existing volume.    (7.)  The effect of the restriction of Soviet imports will not have an appreciable           effect on British industry as a  whole in view of the small proportion which           British exports of manufactured goods to the Soviet Union bears to  the           total  British exports of these goods to all countries.  Locally,  however,           in certain branches of industry it will have a noticeable effect, particularly           from the point of view  of employment.              Certain merchant  firms engaged in re-exporting to  Russia certain           goods of  foreign or colonial origin would  be deprived of the profits           derived from handling  these goods.    (8.)  British industry is not dependent to  any  large extent for  its supplies on           Soviet imports, which would  be purchaseable in  other neutral countries.           An increase in the cost of these supplies might, however, result from such           imports being denied direct access to the British market.   The profits of           British  merchants  handling certain Soviet imports, e.g,,  flax and           platinum,  would  also pass  to their competitors in other neutral countries.    (9.)  The trade restrictions contemplated in this Report might affect the export           to the Soviet Union of certain Empire products  temporarily,  but  the           amount at present imported direct into the Soviet Union would  probably           be gradually absorbed by other neutral countries  for re-export to Russia.                              General Conclusion.   (10.)  The British  Empire and  the Soviet Union are  practically independent of           each other as far  as vital necessities are concerned, and. we consider that a           blockade is most  unlikely to deal a deciding blow.              As we have  already intimated, we have  not examined the  effect on           Soviet Russia of a.blockade in which all her European neighbours joined,           as, for instance, in the  case of coercive action by the League of Nations.&quot;
Afghanistan,.    38.  In  connection   with  the   subsequent  visit  of  King  Amanullah  of afghanistan,  the Cabinet decided that no  subsidy  should be given, either con-currently with the Russian subsidy or as a condition of its withdrawal, the grant ofa subsidy being deemed inconsistent with the proper relations between independent states.  The Cabinet also decided that, while it was unnecessary to encourage the king of Afghanistan or his Ministers to apply for  membership of the League of Nations,any proposal in this direction which might come from the Afghan side should be supported (234th Meeting of the Committee  of Imperial Defence, Minutes  11  and12).   These questions,  however, did not arise on the occasion of King Amanullahsvisit.Indianisation of the Indian A rmy.    39.  In November 1927 a Sub-Committee of the Committee  of Imperial defence was appointed to report on the proposals of the Government of India relating to theIndianisation  of the Indian Army.   The principal features of the  Report  of  this sub-Committee,  as approved  by the Cabinet  (OLD.9 Paper No.  160-D), and subse-quently amended as the result of representations from the Government of India(OLD. Paper  No. 166-D), may be summarised as follows :    &quot; (a.) An announcement should be made  that the Governments policy contem-          plates that, as India progresses towards full self-government within the          Empire, there may be, in process  of development, an army of the same          character as the Dominions Armies,  organised on a national basis  and          officered  by Indians,  provided that  it  is  definitely required that the          process is strictly contingent on the success achieved  in the various stages          of the experiment.    (b.) The &quot; 8-units &quot;  system should be retained as the only practical means of          isolating the experiment of Indianisation, and thus of arriving in course          of time at an accurate estimate of its results.    (c.) The  following  annual  vacancies  should be  allotted  to  Indians:   At          Sandhurst 25;. at  Woolwich and Cranwell 6 each.    (d.) The form of  Commission given  to  Indians  should be unchanged  for the          present;  but this  matter will have  to  be settled  at a  later  date  (see          Enclosure No. 2 to Paper No. 166-D).    (e.) Any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesser          efficiency of completely Indianised units should be made  good, either by           additional  British troops or by  additional Indian  troops  with  British           Officers.&quot; In connection with (e) above, attention is invited to the following extract from the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report:-          &quot; . .  .  .   We do not wish either the Cabinet or the Committee of Imperial     Defence to  be under any illusion as to the effect of the policy under discussion     on the  efficiency of  the Indian  Army.   Our expert military  advisers made it     clear to us  that, in  their opinion, it would  not be safe, at any rate unless  and     until the experiment proved successful,  to rely either in actual warfare  or even     for the maintenance of law and order, on units in which the British element is     within sight of disappearing.   Consequently,  a portion of the Indian Forces     is being deliberately exposed to the risk of atprogressive  deterioration in the     standard of efficiency, Without any corresponding economy, at a moment when     disarmament and economy are the order of the day, and when as revealed by     the enquiries of the Sub-Committee of the  Committee of Imperial Defence on     the Defence  of India-the  military resources of India  require considerable     readjustment  to  enable  them  to  fulfil  the  possible defensive needs  of the     country.&quot;                             VII. THE FAR EAST. China.     40.   Reference has  already been made  in paragraphs 7  to 10 to the  various decisions for the reduction of the Imperial forces in China.     41.   Since the last Annual Report various  questions of detail  have been considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and the Committee of Imperial Defence,  including the arrangements for  reinforcing Hankow  during the period of
 low river (C.I.D. Paper No. 832-B) and the possibility of action against the isogue and Dane&apos;s Islands Forts (C.I.D. Paper No.  841-B).  The former question need not be referred to here, as the period of low river  is past.   As regards the Bogue and Dane&apos;s Islands Forts, the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee were as follows :      &quot;(a.) That provided the necessary forces are concentrated for the purpose, the           capture and demolition of the  Bogue and Dane&apos;s  Islands Forts is a           feasible military operation.     (b.) In order to ensure success, the attacks on both systems of forts should be           simultaneous,  and should be carried out  in such a way as to ensure           surprise in both cases.   We lay particular emphasis on this latter point,           in  view of the suggestion in Sir  Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No.  1563, of           the 4th November, 1927, that &apos; the very knowledge that such preparations           are being made  should have  additional  deterrent  effect.&apos;   Any  such           leakage would seriously militate against the chances of success.     (c.) Having regard to the military consequences  of possible reactions in other           parts of China, we suggest that the proposed operations are inadvisable.&quot;     42.  These  recommendations  were adopted  by a  Cabinet  Committee on the 17th November,  1927, and approved  by  the Cabinet  on the 23rd November,  1927 (OLD. Paper No. 850-B, paragraphs 11 and 13). Hong Kong: Defence.     43.  The  defence of Hong Kong has been examined by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee and is  to be the subject of a  further  paper by the- Chief of the Imperial General Staff (64th Meeting of Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee).     The question of modernising the coast defences at Hong Kong has recently been considered  by  the Chiefs of Staff,  and the Cabinet  have approved the proposals to convert the 9-2-inch gun mountings  with a  view to increasing their elevation (Cabinet 31 (28),  Conclusion 6). The Hong Kong  Aerodrome.    44.  In connection with the despatch of the Shanghai Defence Force and other ieinf or cements to China,  as recorded  in the last Summary (Paper No-. C.O.S.-118, paragraph 73), a British aerodrome had been developed on the leased territory on the mainland  opposite Hong Kong, and  the  Cabinet  have  approved the  policy  of establishing an Air Base there (vide Paragraph 46 below). Japanese A ir Base at Formosa.    45.   In January 1928,  the  Air Staff reported  to the Committee of ImperialDefence that in the previous June it had been finally accepted that the Japanese had established an Air Base at Formosa (C.I.D.  Paper No. 311-C).    46:  On the recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the cabinet have agreed (Cabinet 31 (28), Conclusion 5) :-    (a.) That no  protest should be made at  the present time  against the establish-          ment of a Japanese Air  Base at Formosa.    (b.)  That the development of an Air Base at Hong Kong was not likely to raise          difficulties  at the  present time, as the Japanese  had acquiesced in its          establishment as - an emergency measure during  the  present  abnormal          situation in China, which might continue for some time.    (c.)  That,  apart from this temporary justification of  our action, the develop-          ment of a base on the mainland, not specifically for  coast defence, but for.          purposes of  defence  against  landward  attack,  can  be  defended  as          constituting no infringement of the Washington Treaty.    (d.)  That if, at some future date, protests were raised and the matter were taken          before a Court of Arbitration, it would be right for us to protest at the          same time against the establishment of a  Japanese air base at Formosa.    (e.) That on  this understanding the policy of the establishment of an Air Base          at Hong Kong shouldl)e  approved,
Bias Bay Pirates.    47.  The question of the Bias Bay Pirates has not come before the Committeeof Imperial  Defence since the last Annual Report.  There have been one or tworecent piracies, but British ships have not been affected.The Singapore Naval Base.    48.  This is dealt with in the Report of the Joint Defence Committee (PaperNo. C.O.S.-145).                             VIII. WEST AFRICA.West African Colonies.    49.  The Oversea Defence Committee have recently had under  consideration the question of the defence of  the four West African Colonies in the event of warwith France.    50.  The conclusion of the Committee was that in such an event these  Coloniesmight be faced with a scale of attack against which the existing garrisons would be quite  ineffective,  and that no reliance could be placed on reinforcement from GreatBritain, or from other parts of the Empire during the initial phases of the campaign.It was therefore considered  that, although the present state of our relations with france rendered a war with that country unlikely for many years  to  come, it was desirable that plans should be made to provide from local resources, if and when thenecessity  arises,  both for the preservation  of  the territorial  integrity of these colonies and for the protection of the port of Freetown, the defence of which wouldhe of  great importance in the scheme of Imperial Defence.    51.  The Oversea Defence  Committee recommended that in the first instance theSecretary of State for the Colonies should discuss with the Governors the question of preparing plans :-                                   - &apos;&quot;     (i.) To meet an initial attack against Sierra Leone (for which it was estimated           that 5,000 French Africans would be available).    (ii.) To keep the enemy out of the territories of the Gold Coast and Nigeria for           sufficient time to enable the necessary expansion of the forces  of these           Colonies to develop to its full extent. .    52.  The reduction,of the  regular R.A. and R.E.  garrison at Sierra Leone to acare and maintenance basis, and the disbandment of the West African Regiment,are referred to in  the report of the Joint Oversea and  Home Defence Committee(Paper No.  C.O.S.-145).     IX. OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Belligerent Rights at Sea.    53.  The important question of Belligerent Rights at Sea is under considerationby a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.       .    -Cruiser Programme and Naval OH Fuel Reserves.    54.  On the 29th March, 1928, the Committee of Imperial Defence  took note ofthe Report of a  Cabinet Committee called  the Naval Programme Committee  withregard to the Cruiser  Construction Programme and Naval Oil Fuel Reserves, and theCabinet Conclusions thereon  (C.I.D. Paper No.  858-B),  the&apos;effect of which is summarised in the Minutes  (234th Meeting, Minute 15), as follows:    &quot; (a.) Cruiser  construction programmes should be limited to the requirements of           a  few years ahead.only.    (&amp;.) The Admiralty  figure of, Cruiser requirements (70)&apos; should  be referred to           publicly as little as possible.    (c.) The building Programme for the years 1927 to 1930  should be as follows :            1927-28, 1 Class B; 1928-29, 2 Cruisers*; 1929-30, 1 Class At, 2 Class B.    * Class to ba decided upon later. The expenditure  for the year 1928-29  would in no event be affected.    j&quot; Subject to discussion if the Chancellor of the Exchequer or any Minister may so wish.
    (d.) The Government should take no notice in, public of the building programmes          of the United States of America.               -  ;    (e.) The replacement of  sloops was to be discussed by the First Lord of the          Admiralty and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in connection with the          Navy Estimates for 1928-29.    (/.) Without reopening the question of general policy, 100,000 tons of oil fuel          were to be  placed  to  reserve  in  1928,  the  Cabinet accepting  full          responsibility for this decision; the 100,000 tons of oil fuel so placed to          reserve  was  not to  prejudice the Naval  Programme  Committee  in  its          future decisions regarding the accumulation of  oil fuel reserves.    (g.) The Admiralty need not proceed with the construction of oil tanks on the          basis that the rate of accumulation  of  oil fuel would be 330,000 tons          per annum.    (h.) The Naval Programme Committee  should be constituted a Sub-Committee          of the Committee of Imperial Defence,&quot;Distribution and Strength of the British Army.    55.  During the course of a discussion on this subject, attention  was drawn tothe fact that the Expeditionary Force  had been reduced to  5 Divisions, of  whichthe last two  could not take the field until 5 months after the outbreak of war.  Owingto the  absence of the Secretary of State for War in  India, further considerationof the  question was postponed until his  return.    56.  A  Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been appointedto consider what strength of Cavalry of the Line should be maintained in the british army, and how it should be organized.  The Cabinet (Cabinet 31 (28),  Conclusion 7),on  the recommendation of  the Committee of Imperial  Defence,  approved theconclusions of this  Sub-Committee, which were as follows :  .   &apos;; (1.) Leaving out of account the possibility of a reduction of the British Cavalry          in India, which is outside our reference, from the point of view of economy          we are  unable on the evidence that has been laid before us to recommend          any change in the organization of the mounted arm which would produce           a saving.    (2.) We recommend that the War  Office policy (see  paragraph XIII above),          both in  the conversion of  Cavalry Regiments  into  Armoured  Car           Regiments,  and in the progressive mechanization of the machine-gun           equipment and transport of the remaining Cavalry Regiments, should be          approved.    (3.) We would  draw particular  attention to  the  desirability,  as increased           mechanization  becomes possible,  of  making  the fullest  use  of the           traditions of the  Cavalry and of the spirit and special qualities of its           personnel in its mechanized substitute.    (4.) Recognizing  the capital  cost involved   in the  full development  of           mechanization, we recommend that the change should be made with due           regard to financial considerations.&quot;Air Defence of Great Britain-Inter-Relationship of  Authorities Concerned.    57.  The Committee of Imperial Defence have approved a Report by the Chiefsof  Staff  setting  forth the  principles  to  govern the  inter-relationship betweenauthorities  concerned with the  defence of Great Britain against air attack (234thMeeting, and C.I.D. Paper No, 160-A).Anti-Aircraft Research.    58.  A report (C.I.D. Paper  No.  866-B) setting out the present position  inregard to  Anti-Aircraft  Research in  this  country  has been  approved  by  theCommittee  of Imperial Defence (234th Meeting, Minute 1).    The findings of thisreport are too lengthy for inclusion in this summary.  The most important conclusion was to the effect that, so far as can at present be foreseen, detection of the approach of hostile aircraft must mainly  rest on acoustical methods,  for which purpose theprovision of an experimental &quot; mirror &quot; at a cost of  5,000 is recommended.  Thisrecommendation was approved by the  Cabinet on the 25th April, 1928 (Cabinet 24&quot;(28),  Conclusion 6).
        The Government should take no notice impublic of the building programmes&apos;          of the United States of America.        The replacement of  sloops was  to be discussed by the First Lord of the          Admiralty and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in connection with the          Navy Estimates for  1928-29.        Without reopening the question of general policy, 100,000 tons of oil fuel          were to be  placed   to  reserve  in  1928,  the  Cabinet accepting full          responsibility for this decision;  the 100,000 tons of oil fuel so placed to          reserve  was  not to  prejudice the Naval Programme  Committee  in  its          future decisions regarding the accumulation of  oil fuel reserves.        The Admiralty need not proceed with the construction of oil tanks on the          basis that the rate  of accumulation  of  oil fuel would be 330,000 tons          per annum.        The Naval Programme Committee should be constituted a Sub-Committee          of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;Distribution and Strength of the British Army.    55.  During the course of a discussion on this subject, attention  was drawn tothe fact that the Expeditionary  Force had been reduced to 5 Divisions, of  whichthe last two could not take the field until 5 months after the outbreak of war.  Owingto the  absence of the Secretary of State for War in  India, further  considerationof the  question was postponed until his  return.    56.  A Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been appointedto consider what strength of Cavalry of the Line should be maintained  in the british army,  and how it should be organized.  The Cabinet (Cabinet 31 (28),  Conclusion 7),on  the recommendation of  the Committee  of Imperial  Defence,  approved theconclusions of this  Sub-Committee, which were as follows :  .   &quot; (1.) Leaving out of account the possibility of a reduction of the British Cavalry          in India, which is outside our reference, from the point of view of economy          we are  unable on the evidence that has been laid before us  to recommend          any change in the organization of the mounted arm which would produce          a saving.    (2.) We recommend that the War  Office policy  (see paragraph  XIII  above),          both in the conversion of  Cavalry Regiments  into  Armoured Car          Regiments,  and  in  the progressive mechanization  of  the machine-gun          equipment and transport of the  remaining Cavalry Regiments, should be          approved.    (3.) We would  draw particular  attention to the  desirability,  as increased          mechanization becomes possible, of  making  the  fullest  use  of the          traditions of the  Cavalry and of the spirit and special qualities of its          personnel in its mechanized substitute.    (4.) Recognizing  the  capital cost  involved  in  the  full  development  of          mechanization, we recommend that the change should be made with due          regard to financial considerations.&quot;Air Defence of Great Britain-Inter-Relationship of Authorities Concerned.    57.  The Committee of Imperial Defence have approved a Report by the  Chiefsof  Staff  setting  forth  the  principles  to govern  the  inter-relationship betweenauthorities concerned with the defence of  Great Britain against air  attack  (234thMeeting, and OLD. Paper  No. 160-A).4 nti-A aircraft Research.    58.  A  report (OLD. Paper No. 866-B)  setting out the present position inregard to Anti-Aircraft Research in  this country  has  been  approved  by  theCommittee of Imperial Defence (234th Meeting, Minute 1).   The findings of thisreport are too lengthy for inclusion in this summary.  The most important conclusion was to the effect that, so far as can at present be foreseen, detection of the approach of hostile aircraft must mainly rest on  acoustical methods, for which  purpose  theprovision of an experimental &quot;mirror&quot;  at. a cost of  5,000 is recommended.  Thisrecommendation was  approved  bv the Cabinet on the 25th April,  1928 (Cabinet 24(28), Conclusion 6).
                                       iOA ir Raids Precautions.     59.   The Committee studying this question are concerned with the protectionof the civil population in the event of air attack.  Their recommendations, therefore,do not normally ^nect strategical issues.  During the last year,  however, they have drawn  attention  to  the advisability,  in making  plans  for the development  ofindustrial activity during war time, of relying as far as possible upon undertakingscarried on outside the London Area.Chemical Warfare.     60.   The Committee of Imperial Defence at its 234th meeting agreed to take nostep to ratify the Washington Treaty for the Protection of Lives of Neutrals and non-Combatants at Sea in Time of War  and the Prevention of the Use of NoxiousGases and Chemicals.  The reason underlying  this conclusion was that, thoughdesirous of limiting in any way the use of  submarines,  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas anxious to retain as free a hand as  possible with regard to chemical  warfare.As both these aspects of war were contained  in the Treaty referred to  above, ratifica-tion in respect of the one could not be effected without ratification of the other.     61.   In this connection it is noteworthy that  the  Government of the soviet republic, and more recently Italy, have notified their adherence to, and subsequentratification of, the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925.Irish Free State Coastal Defence.     62.   The second meeting of the conference  with representatives of the IrishFree State to discuss the share that the latter might take in her coastal defence inaccordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Irish Treaty has been indefinitelypostponed.     63.  An informal meeting with representatives of  the  Irish Free State at  theAdmiralty on the 26th April, 1927, showed that the Free State interpreted Article of the Treaty to mean that they should be  allowed to take over and maintain  the defences at the three&apos; reserved ports of  Queenstown, Berehaven,  and  Lough Swilly.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain have decided that they will not discussthe handing over  of  these defences  to the Free  State,  and this  decision has been communicated to the latter.     64.  The prospects of a further conference on this question are, therefore, remote,but a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has made certain recommendations (C.I.D. Paper No. 310-C)  as to the attitude to be adopted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government if and when negotiations are  resumed, and these recommenda-tions have been approved.Imperial Communications.     65.   In view of the impending  Imperial Conference oh Cable and wireless services,  a Sub-Committee  of  the Imperial  Communications Committee was estab-lished to report  on the strategical aspect of  the competition between these Services.The recommendations of this Sub-Committee, which were approved by the Committeeof Imperial Defence  (230th  Meeting, Minute 6, and 231st Meeting,  Minute 3), wereto the effect that, in  its present stage of development, wireless could not whollysupersede cables for strategical purposes, and certain cables, which were susceptible-of classification, were necessary in time of war.  The full recommendations of this sub-Committee are to be found in C.I.D. Paper No. 851-B.   A further inquiry was instituted  to determine  the degree of reliance which could be  placed in  wirelessmessages.  This inquiry established that at the moment reliance cannot be placed  onmessages transmitted by wireless  from the point of view of secrecy, and also  onaccount of &quot;jamming&quot;  and &quot;fading.&quot;   These latter difficulties might in time  be overcome by developments in wireless, while,  &quot;with a satisfactory  organisation  forthe distribution, maintenance and care of cypher machines!, wireless messages can be rendered absolutely reliable from the point  of view of secrecy,  provided a certainsmall amount of money is expended on their development &quot; (OLD. Paper No. 857-B).General Principles of Imperial Defence.     66.   The Oversea Defence Committee, with whom were associated service repre-sentatives of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have prepared  a Memorandumentitled Some General Principles of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 313-C) in replacement of C.I.D. Paper No. 62-C.
     This Memorandum was considered and approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 235th meeting. Defence Schemes,   Notification of Precautionary and  War Measures.     67.  The  Oversea  Defence Committee have  also produced a  Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 316-C) in replacement of their Memorandum No. 455-M, dated the 30th December, 1912, containing lists of telegrams notifying Precautionary and War Measures which would be sent to the Dominions and  Colonies on the institution of the Precautionary Stage or the outbreak of war.     This Memorandum was approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 235th meeting. Work of the Oversea Defence Committee.     68.  In addition to  the above and to the activities in coast defence recorded in the report of  the  Joint  Defence Committee, the Oversea Defence Committee have also considered and  prepared  papers on  a variety of  questions connected with Colonial Defence.   Among these  are the questions of  food  supply for the civil population at Hong Kong and Singapore in time of war, the defence of the Bahamas, the organization of local mine-sweeping  services in the Colonies,  the  defence of Takoradi Harbour, the protection of the Miri Oilfields, and the Jamaica and British Honduras Defence Force Ordinances.     69.  The  Local Forces Sub-Committee of the Oversea Defence Committee have made recommendations  regarding the organization of local forces in the Straits Settlements, the Windward Islands, the Seychelles, Cyprus, Hong  Kong, and the Falkland Islands. Work of the Home Defence Committee.    70.   The  work of the Home Defence  Committee since  the last Annual Review is covered by the separate report of the Joint Defence Committee. Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.    71.   The  Preparatory Commission at Geneva  has continued its study of the question of  Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, without, however,  recording any appreciable progress.   This question has been removed from the purely military to the  quasi-political sphere,  and  has  been bound  up with  considerations  of arbitration,  &amp;c.   In consequence,   the examination of  this question  has  been conducted in this country by a Cabinet Committee,  and thus there is no decision of importance on the part of &quot;the Committee of Imperial  Defence to record since thedate of the last annual review.

[CO.8. 145.   (Revise.) ]                               Annexure 3.         The Defence  of  Ports at Home and Abroad Annual  Review.MEMORANDUM BY THE JOINT OVERSEA AND HOME DEFENCE SUB-COMMITTEE  OF THE                       COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.    1.  IN accordance with the request of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee* inconnection with the preparation of their Annual Review of Imperial Defence, theJoint Oversea and Home Defence Committee have prepared the following statement showing the present position in regard to the defences of Defended Ports at Homeand Abroad, with a view to ascertaining the extent  to  which actual provision of defences complies with the policy approved for these ports.    2.  Since the last  Annual Review by the Chiefs of  Staff Sub-Committee,  two important Memoranda connected with coast defence have been prepared by the joint defence Committee.    The first was a revised Memorandum entitled &quot; Coast  Def ence-Forms of  attack and Forms of Defence&quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 157-A).   This Memorandum explainsthe basis on which our present  system of coast defence rests.    The second paper  is entitled &apos;&apos; The Defence of Ports at Home and Abroad Order of Priority for Installation of Armament &quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 297-C).  In this the Joint Committee suggested that, although considerations of finance will limit theextent to which defences  already approved can be established in the near future, itwas desirable to formulate an order of priority for the installation or reorganizationof the armament, having regard to the relative strategic  importance of the variousports  and  the  present  state  of  their  defences;  and they  submitted a  definiteprogramme for execution as and when funds become available.    Both these Memoranda were approved by the Committee of Imperial defence at their 231st Meeting, held on  the 19th December, 1927.    3.  In addition, the Joint  Defence Committee have continued their investigation of the detailed defences  of  home  and oversea  ports, and have  submitted various recommendations which are referred to below.Classification of Ports.    4.  In considering coast defences, ports are divided into three categories, A, B,and C, which may be defined as follows :-    Category A. Places  at which adequate defences should be installed in peace        time, to be fully manned and efficient before the outbreak of hostilities.    Category B. Places  at which adequate defences should be installed in peace        time, to be manned within 48 hours after the outbreak of war.    Category C. Places at which it will not be necessary to instal defences in peace        time, but for which defence schemes should be prepared to meet probable        war requirements.    As the Chiefs of Staff are  probably  aware,  the  Royal Artillery  and RoyalEngineer garrisons of all Category A ports abroad are maintained in accordance withour present policy at only 50 per cent, of war strength, although in theory the defencesshould be installed and fully manned before the outbreak of hostilities.    These Category A ports must therefore be accorded  a high order of  priority, if and when increased war preparations become necessary  owing to a clouding of theinternational outlook.   In such  circumstances,  the question of  preparing  for  thedespatch of war garrisons to  the  Category B ports abroad would also  have to beconsidered.* C.O.S. 57th Meeting Conclusion ( ).
                                                                             &apos;3J ij SJ                                      43Category C Ports.                                                            i     5.   The Committee feel they should also draw attention to the position  of category C ports abroad, which they have  recently had under consideration.  Atpresent this class of defended port exists only on paper.  The necessary  armament and stores which would be required at the ports as soon as possible after the outbreakof war have not  yet been earmarked, and no plans exist for the despatch of the artillery and Engineer  garrisons.     The Category C ports which would be required for naval use in a European War-do  not necessarily  coincide  with those required for a  Far  Eastern war, and theCommittee have,  therefore,  formed the opinion that these ports should be dividedinto two classes, and that the necessary armament,  adaptable to either eventuality,should be stored  at Malta and  Aden, which fortresses should  also,  they consider,furnish the necessary personnel on the outbreak of war, such personnel being replaced by drafts from home at the earliest opportunity.     A Memorandum on this question, for submission to the Committee of ImperialDefence, is now in course of preparation.Ammunition Reserves at Defended Ports.     6.  Another  matter of  some importance  has come  to light  during  recentdeliberations of the Oversea Defence Committee.  It  has been found that none of the9-2-inch and  6-inch war and equipment ammunition reserves at defended  portsconsists of the latest type of  naval shell.  The question of replacing this ammunitionis under consideration.     7.   Defended ports are considered below in the following sections :           (a.) Home Ports.          (&amp;.) Singapore.          (c.) Hong Kong.          (d.) Ports East of Suez (including Indian Ports).          (e.) Mediterranean Ports.            &apos;          (/.) Atlantic Ports.                 :          (g.) Dominion Ports.     8.                       (a.) HOME PORTS.         Category A:          -             Berehaven;             Portsmouth  and Southampton.             Plymouth.             Harwich.                                         ......             The Thames. &quot;             The Medway. ,             &apos;             The Forth.                 -             Milford Haven.             The Mersey,                                                     :             The I Lumber.                 -             The Clyde.             The Tyne.             The Tees and Hartlepool.                              &apos;  ;         Category B   -                                                     \             Lough Swilly.                                                   :             Queenstown.     Recommendations with regard to the above  defended ports are contained inC.I.D.  Paper  No. 158-A, which was  approved at the  233rd Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the 16th February, 1928.   .  The ^remaining ports under Category B, and those in-Category C, shown inAppendix No, 1 of J.D.C. Paper No. 69 (also C.I.D. Paper No. 158-A) have notyet been considered by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.
     9.   In the Joint oommittee&apos;s Report a net decrease of no less than 168 gunsrof which 55 are of 6-inch calibre or above, and of 57 electric lights is recommended.     The cost  involved,  however,  in  rearranging  the  seafront  defences,  andparticularly in increasing the elevation of guns, is estimated at  1,292,800.    . In addition, the cost of Local Naval Defences is estimated at  839,000.     It  is reasonable to assume, however, that the sale of the surplus armament andof the abandoned sites will appreciably diminish the above cost.     The scales of anti-aircraft defence are now  under consideration, and will formthe subject of a further report.                               (b.) SINGAPORE.     10.  The question of the  defences of Singapore has recently been again underconsideration by the  Chiefs  of  Staff Sub-Committee  and  by the Committee ofImperial Defence.     11.  The situation is now as&quot; follows :      The present policy is to complete the Naval Base by 1937.   The first  stage ofthe seafront defences, i.e.,  3 15-inch guns, 4 9-2-inch guns, and  8 6-inch guns,together with the necessary defence lights, on the South  and East of Singapore, willbe completed by the end of the financial year 1932-33.     It  is proposed to instal anti-aircraft  guns at the  rate  of 4 per  annum.  Atpresent 3-inch guns only are available, but the 4 - 7-inch anti-aircraft gun, at presentin the experimental stage, may replace the 3-inch in later issues.     Consideration  of the remaining stages of the defences,  including the westerndefences, has been postponed for future examination, when additional information should be available as to what  role Naval and Air units may  be expected to play inthe defence of  Singapore.Local Naval Defences.     The situation regarding Local Naval Defences is as follows:      A /S Nets and Flotation. Available now.  Stored at Rosyth.     A jT Nets and Flotation. Available now.  Stored at Rosyth.     Gate Vessels. None available.    The possibility  of converting  two  barrage         vessels for this service is being investigated.     Boom Working Trawler. No provision yet made.     Mooring Lighter. Proposed  that Lighter attached  to dockyard be used.     Loop Minefield          Mines and Sinkers.  Available from stocks.         Cable.*  First instalment to be purchased 1929.  Completed 1934.         Instruments.   First instalment to be purchased 1929.  Completed 1930.         Control  Station.  Design under consideration.     Indicator Loops          Cablet  First instalment to be purchased 1933. Completed 1934.         Tail Cablet  First instalment to be purchased 1933.  Completed 1934.             Instruments to be purchased 1930.       &quot;Military Garrison.                                  -     12.  Uncertainty exists as to whether  reliance can  be placed on the reinforce-ment of the Infantry garrison from India, on the outbreak of war, should this benecessary.     It was- represented at the 234th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial  defence that, owing to the internal situation, or to the fear of Russia seizing  the opportunityof war between Japan and ourselves to attack in the direction of Afghanistan, Indiamight find herself unable to provide any troops for Singapore.  Field-Marshal SirClaud Jacob has been asked to report on the matter, after  communication with India.    13.  Attack  on Singapore  from the West either by.bombardment or by  landingparties  would, in the opinion of the Admiralty,  not present insuperable difficultiesfrom the naval point of view.   In consequence, the General  Officer Commanding,    *  Sufficient reserve stock of loop cable to complete Sii gapore Minefield now, if required.    1  Type of cable  not yet settled;  only stocks of wiir-time guttapercha cable available; unsuitable fortropics
Malaya, is being asked to report, in consultation with the local naval authorities,on the difficulties of a landing attack on the West and South-west of the Island,and  on the steps that might be taken to deal with it.Air  Base.     14.  The completion of the air base was originally  planned for 1935.   The-present position is that the aerodrome itself has so far been prepared as to allow ofan L-shaped landing ground which is suitable for use by light aircraft.  Accommoda-tion  for the care and maintenance party will be completed by the  end of 1928, but nosheds or technical buildings have yet been erected.                              (c.) HONG KONG.     15.   The fixed defences at Hong Kong at present consist of :&apos;              8 9-2-inch guns.            11 -6-inch guns.             4 4-7-inch guns.     A decision is required as to whether the existing 9-2-inch and 6-inch guns maybe brought up to date by increasing their elevation, since in their present conditionthese guns are incapable of dealing with modern cruisers.     It has been represented that such a procedure might be considered a contraven-tion of the Washington Treaty, which prevents any &quot; increase of the coast defences,&quot;and the  Joint Defence Committee are  informed that the matter is being brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Chiefs of Staff.Anti-Air craft Defences.     16.-   No definite recommendations have yet been made as to the scale of anti-aircraft  defence armament which should be installed.  There are, however, four3-inch anti-aircraft guns held in store.  It has been proposed that they should bemanned  by the  Local Forces, but  recent  reports  indicate  that  they may have considerable difficulty in doing so.LocaVN aval Defences and Mines.     17.   Pending report as to storage facilities which can be made available withoutinfringing the  Washington Treaty,  no provision has  yet been made.   It has beendecided that it would be inexpedient to send mines to Hong Kong in the present political  situation.Aerodrome.                         -     18.   A civil aerodrome site has been purchased, and the work of reclamation ofthe landing area has been commenced.  It is not known by what date the aerodromeis likely  to be completed.     19.   The Committee understand that the Chiefs of Staff have under considera-tion the question of increasing the permanent peace-time garrison of Hong Kong.    20.     (d.)

m         Category C -             Kilindini.             Suez,             Shatt-al-Arab.     The above ports (with the exception of Suez and  Shatt-al-Arab) formed thesubject of a report by the Joint Defence Committee (J.D.C. Paper No. 21, also 0.1.D.No. 228-C) in 1924.  The recommendations of the Committee were approved by theCommittee of Imperial Defence at their 188th Meeting on the 2nd October, 1924, andhave been adopted by the authorities concerned, subject to minor modifications.Local Naval Defences.     21.  The cost of the local naval defences recommended at Trincomali, Colomboand  Penang is estimated at  173,800,  whilst, if the international situation in theEast should become  clouded, additional local naval defences are recommended at  a cost  of  41,000.     Sufficient stocks of A / S and  A / T  Net are held  at  Rosyth to complete the defences of Trincomali.     No provision has yet been  made  for the A/T defences  at  the Breakwaterentrances at Colombo and Madras, nor  for  Indicator Loops at  Colombo.   Thedevelopment of Indicator Loops is still under investigation.Fixed  Defences.     22.  The recommendations involve a  total increase at the above ports of 2-9-2-inch guns, 6 4-7-inch Q.F.  guns, and 12 anti-aircraft guns, together with  adecrease of 4 10-inch B.L., 8 7-5-inch B.L., and 2 6-inch BL.     At the same time, it is recommended that the elevation of various 9-2-inch and-inch guns now existing should be  increased.     The total estimated  initial  cost amounts to   1,202,130, divided between theHome  Government and&apos;the Government of India in the  proportion of  805,220 and 396,910 respectively.     The annual cost of maintenance of establishments on a 50 per cent, peace basiswill  necessitate an increase of  60,400 in expenditure by the Home Government, andwill  allow a saving of  29,000 to the Government of India.     None of these recommendations have yet been put into effect,  and owing to financial stringency there is little  likelihood of this being carried out for many years.Air  Defences.     23.  The installation of anti-aircraft guns at Trincomali,  Colombo and  Adenhas been recommended, but the question of providing air  forces for the protection oftrade, or to assist in  the defence of the ports in question,  remains to be considered.     By a recent decision of the Committee of Imperial Defence it has been decidedthat the defence  of  Aden  should be a  responsibility of the Air Ministry (C.I.D.,231st Minutes, dated the 19th December,  1927, Minute  14).    24.               (e.) MEDITERRANEAN PORTS.         Category A              Gibraltar.             Malta.         Category C*                                &apos; - ,             Alexandria.                                *             Port Said.    * Haifa will also require  consideration as a Category C port if and  when it is decided to construct apipe-line terminating there.
     The Mediterranean Ports are at present being investigated by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee, whose report should be available during the next few months.  It may, however, generally be stated that the following situation exists :       (i.) Gibraltar. The 9-2-inch guns  require  increased  elevation.    The anti-             aircraft defences require considerable strengthening.     (ii.) Malta-Two 6-inch and the 9-2-inch guns require increased elevation, and             the anti-aircraft defences require considerable strengthening.     It is anticipated that the number of 9-2-inch and 6-inch guns will be considerably reduced, especially in the case of Gibraltar. Alexandria, Port Said.     25.  No  arrangements at  present exist for the  provision of armament or personnel to man the defences of these ports (and of Suez) on the outbreak of war (vide paragraph 5 above). Local Naval Defences.     26.  The cost  of the local Naval  Defences which are being recommended is estimated at  65,500 for Malta and  20,000 for Gibraltar.   No provision has beenmade for A/S or A/T Net at Malta as yet.   Shore Asdics (which were proposed, and are included in the above cost) are still in the experimental stage.     With  regard to the Gibraltar defences, it is proposed to send out sufficientA/T Net this year for trials to be carried out at one entrance.  This net will remain at Gibraltar after the trials.     27.                    (/.)  ATLANTIC PORTS.         Category A               Kingston (Jamaica).         Category B               Sierra Leone, t              Bermuda, t              St. Helena.     The Atlantic Ports have not yet been reviewed by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.     The following decisions have, however, recently been made :      (i.) Sierra Leone. The fixed defences of Freetown have been placed on a care and maintenance basis, subject to annual review, and one of the two local battalions at   Sierra  Leone  (the West  African  Regiment)  is  being disbanded  (C.I.D. 230th Minutes, dated the 1st November, 1927, Minute (3), and  recent  Cabinet decisions).     (ii.) Bermuda, The fixed defences have been placed on a care and maintenance basis.     The Committee of Imperial Defence have approved of a  proposal that the coast defence troops at  Bermuda should  be withdrawn at an early date, and  that the armament and defence electric lights should be handed over to the local forces with a, staff of regular Instructors, to ensure that the existing material will be maintained in efficient condition.  This arrangement is to be subject to annual  review.  (C.I.D. 230th Minutes, dated the 1st November, 1927, Minute (2)).     (iii.) St.  Helena. The question  of the  responsibility for  the  defence  of St. Helena has been under discussion by  the Oversea Defence Committee, and after reference to the Committee of Imperial Defence, it was decided that  the  present arrangement, namely, that the Admiralty should be  responsible for the defences in peace time and the War Office for their operation in war, should continue.  (C.I.D. 226th Minutes, dated the 5th May, 1927, Item (3)).    t These ports, although shown under Category 15, do not comply with the definition of this Category-given in paragraph 4 above, since it. would not be possible for the garrisons to arrive within 48 hours of the- outbreak of hostilities, unless they left, home, prior to, the declaration of war&quot;.
     28.                   (g.) DOMINION PORTS.     (i.) Canada. The defences of Halifax and  Esquimault have  not  yet been reviewed by the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.     (ii.) South Africa. The defences of the South African Ports  were recently considered by the Committee of  Imperial Defence at the request of the Union Government,  and the  Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee  recommended that, if hitherto existing principles were adhered to, the following reorganisation should be effected :      Local  Naval  Defences  should  be provided  at  Capetown,  Simonstown and Saldanha Bay, at  a cost of  12,000 to  16,000.     Seafront Defences. That a net decrease of 4 6-inch  guns, 2 4-7-inch guns and 2 electric lights should be made, the remaining armament being rearranged and modernised as regards elevation, at a cost of about  99,000 (based on costs in Great Britain), without  making any allowance for material scrapped.     The Committee of Imperial Defence, however, suggested to the South African Government  that, in view of the  present satisfactory  international situation, and of the potentialities of aircraft in the role of coast defence, no reorganisation of the coast defences was necessary in the immediate future (C.I.D.  Paper No.  309-C, C.I.D. 232nd Minutes, dated the 26th January, 1928, Minute (1)).    (iii.) Australian Ports            Sydney.           Albany.           Melbourne.           Adelaide.     &apos;           Freemantle.           Brisbane.           Newcastle.           Hobart.           Thursday Island.           Port Darwin.    The defences of the Australian Ports were considered by the Joint Oversea and home Defence Committee in 1925  (OLD. Paper No. 249-C), and a net increase  of 13 9 - 2-inch guns was recommended, as against a  decrease of  20 guns of smallercalibre.    The Report was approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 203rdMeeting, held on the 15th October, 1925, and forwarded to Australia:    None of  the recommendations has yet been carried out.  The decisions of the Council of  Defence have not yet been received.  It is understood that the Councilintended to deal with this during their meeting at Easter.    The Australian Navy Board have recently asked if stores for the proposed loopminefield at Albany are available  in England,  to which a reply was  sent that nostores  were at  present available.   It  was  recommended that,  in  view of the experimental work now being carried out in connection with loop  mining,  it wasinadvisable to purchase stores at present.  ;    (iv.) New Zealand Ports           Auckland.          Wellington.          Port  Lyttleton.          Otago.    The defences  of the New Zealand Ports were considered in 1926  by the JointOversea and Home Defence Committee (OLD. Paper No. 260-C), who recommended net increase of 12 or 13 6-inch guns and 8 lights, and a -decrease of 2 12-pounders.They also recommended the provision of Local Naval Defences at a cost of   96,000.    The report was approved by the  Committee of Imperial Defence at their 210thMeeting on the 25th February, 1926, and forwarded to New Zealand.
    The latter have not yet given effect to any of the recommendations, and in aReport  by the  General Officer  Commanding the Forces of New  Zealand,  covering the period 1st June, 1926, to 31st May, 1927, it is stated that          &quot; Careful consideration has been given to the question of coast defence    armament  and requirements, arid several important recommendations have been    received from the War Office.  Owing to the heavy expenditure involved,  and    in view of  the rapid development of the Air Service and possible potentialities    of aircraft taking a still greater share in the problem of coast  defence,  it has    been considered advisable to defer putting these recommendations into effect.&quot;                                 SUMMARY.     29.  It will be seen from the preceding paragraphs that although the forms ofdefence required for defended  ports have recently been brought  up to date and approved (C.I.D. Paper No. 157-A);  and although the Joint Defence Committeehave already examined and made recommendations for the majority of defended ports both at home and abroad, including those  in Australia, New Zealand, andSouth Africa, the only port where armament is being installed,  and on which any appreciable sum of money is being spent, is Singapore.     30.  The Committee do not wish to criticize the resultant backward state of the defences at many ports which might be of great importance in war, but feel it their duty to draw attention to the fact that it can only be accepted with equanimity so longas the present international outlook, as envisaged by the Foreign  Office, lasts.  Theywould also point out that any sudden change of the international situation vis-a-visa maritime Power would necessitate the expenditure of a very large sum of moneyif the other necessary  ports, besides  Singapore, are to be modernised and equipped for war,  and there would be no certainty that this would be effected in sufficient time.     31.  It should also be mentioned that the policy of placing defended ports inthe present low order of priority in defence preparations has had a reaction on theDominions. For example, although the defences of Australia and New Zealand havebeen reported on, and the  various recommendations of the Committee of ImperialDefence have been accepted in principle, no work on the coast defences has actually,been undertaken in these Dominions.  No doubt the  conclusions of the Committeeof Imperial Defence in regard to the defences of South African  ports will exercisesome influence on other Dominions.     The Committee venture, however, to suggest that the time spent in investigatingand making recommendations on the various defended ports has hot been wasted,since this will enable the efficiency of the defences to be increased more speedily than would otherwise be the case if and when the international situation demands it.     32.  So long as the international situation is such as to enable the reorganizationof our coast defences to be postponed without risk,  there may even be some advantages in this course.   Apart from economy, delay enables  advantage to be taken of alltechnical improvements.  For example, it will no doubt before long be possible to lay down more accurately the role  of aircraft in coast  defence,  and,  as a result of bombardment trials which are being undertaken this year at Malta and Portsmouth,more information may be available as to the destructive capabilities of bombardmentby ships of coast defences and vice versa.  Nevertheless, the  Committee would stress the fact that the mobility of the fleet in time of war would be seriously impaired ifbases on which reliance is placed are found to be  inadequately defended.     33.  The  more important features  in the detailed situation  may be briefly summarised as  follows :      (i.) According  to our present policy Singapore should be provided with sufficient           defences by 1937.    (ii.) Hong Kong is not adequately defended,  and a decision is required as to           whether the re-organization of the fixed defences is permissible under the           Washington Treaty.
2.  Whitehall Gafdens, S.W.1,        May 7, 1928.o(iii.)  T4ie*defehees of the Ports East of Suez would necessitate, when re-organiza-        tion becomes feasible  or necessary, an expenditure of over  1,200,000j        divided between the Home; Government and the Indian Government:(iv.)  The Mediterranean Ports are now under investigation, and will undoubtedly        require considerable/re-organization and expenditure to bring them up-        to date.  (v.)  The fixed armament of the Atlantic Ports, which has not yet been considered        by the Joint Defence Committee, is also to some extent out of date.  The        garrisons of Sierra Leone and Bermuda have been reduced to a care and        maintenance basis.  (vi.) In order to complete the survey of the defences of Dominion ports, the coast        defences of Canada ought to be reviewed.  The Joint Committee propose        to undertake this at an early date.(vii.)  Category C ports,  which are not  defended in peace time, but would be        required  on the  outbreak  of war, exist  at  present  only on  paper.        Recommendations regarding the storing  of the necessary armament and        equipment, and the provision of personnel, are shortly being submitted by        the Joint Defence Committee.                      (Signed)       G. N. MACREADY,  Secretary.                              Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee.
