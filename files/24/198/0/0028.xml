This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. .               Printed for the Cabinet...   November 1928.SECRET.                                                    Gopy No.C.P. 328 (28).                                CABINET.THE  WEST INDIAN CABLE AND  WIRELESS SYSTEM.        MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    WITH  reference  to  the  Imperial  Telegraphs  Bill, I  circulate,  for theconsideration of the&apos; Cabinet, a memorandum drawing attention to certain  points arising out of the sale of the West Indian Cable and Wireless system to the Com-munications  Company which is to be formed in accordance with the report  of theImperial Wireless and Cable Conference.                                                                   L. S, A.    Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,              November 1,  1928.                                  MEMORANDUM.       1.   The West Indian Cable was laid and its subsidiary wireless stations erected   in 1924/5 with the approval of  Parliament, on the joint responsibility of Great   Britain, Canada and the West Indian Colonies concerned^  Great Britain finding   the initial capital required, and  the system is managed and operated on behalf of   all these Governments by the Pacific Cable Board as their agents.       2.   The main  reasons  for  laying  a  new cable, although  all the  Colonies   concerned, save British Guiana,  were  already connected  by  the cable of the West.   India and Panama Company  with the outside world, were :         (a.) The West  India  and Panama Company would have demanded a large             increase  in the subsidy  paid under  its agreement when that lapsed in             1924.  Having a  monopoly of telegraphic communications with most of             the  Colonies, it would have been in a  position to extort unduly favourable             terms.       (5.) The West India and  Panama cables were old and  worn.  The Company             was not in a position  to renew  them out of its own resources.  Delays             and interruptions had become intolerable.       (c) The Company&apos;s cable passed through foreign territory.       (d.) The Company was inextricably bound by agreements with other companies             operating on foreign soil, and among them one with the Cuba Submarine             Company.  This  agreement,  which prevented it  from entering into             any agreement prejudicial to the interests of that Company, and obliged             it either to send messages over its cable  or  to hand over a propor-             tionate  charge, had for  more than a generation frustrated all  attempts             to improve cable communication with the West Indies, and was the main             reason for laying the new cable.       3.   The system involves  a loss  amounting to about half  the subsidy previously11 paid to the West  Indies  and Panama  Cable  Company.   In the opinion of the   Pacific  Cable  Board, the loss is  more likely to increase than to decrease.  But it          [18398]
i must not be thought that if the system did not prosper  there would be no demand by the West Indian islands to be provided with an efficient system of telegraphiccommunication.   Their economic life is so dependent on it, and they have enjoyedit so long, that they would never willingly consent to be left without it merely on theground that it did not pay.    4.  In 1927 an offer to purchase the Government system was received from the direct West India Company,  which in the interval had acquired control  of theCuba  Submarine Company and, through the latter, of the West India and PanamaCable  Company, thus owning and controlling all the cables connecting the british west  Indian Colonies except the Government cable.  This offer made it necessary  toconsider very carefully the conditions on which the Government system could safely be transferred to a private company without running the risk  of reviving the stateof affairs existing in 1924.  If the offer had not been ultimately withdrawn owing  tothe developments which have since led&apos;, inter alia.,  to the acquisition, of the  DirectWest  India Company by the Eastern Telegraph Company, the conditions on whichI should have thought it necessary to insist in order to secure the essential interestsof the Governments and communities  concerned, before any offer  to purchase the cable could even have been taken into consideration, however financially attractive,would  have been :     (flu) A definite undertaking to continue  the services now  performed by the           Government system at rates not in excess of the present rates for a  period           of, say, 25 years, without payment of any subsidy.    (&amp;.) A definite undertaking not to transfer the ownership  or control of any  of           their West Indian cables or wireless stations  without the consent  of the           Government.    (c.) Cancellation of the objectionable clauses in the agreement of 1870 between           the  Cuba  Submarine  Company  and  the  West  India  and  Panama           Company, and any connected or subsidiary agreements.    (d.) An undertaking to avoid  as far as possible taking British West Indian           traffic through foreign territory or through stations or lines under foreign           control.    (e.) An arrangement for  taking over  the  Carriacou and  Montserrat wireless           stations  at cost price, less  any amount in  the Sinking Eund, and for           their operation as part of the system.    (/.) Substitution of  landing licences for  a term of, say,  25 years,  for  those           licences of the West India and Panama Company which contain no limit           of time and are claimed to be in perpetuity.    5.   The considerations which applied to the sale of the West Indian Cable and wireless system to the Direct West India Company apply also to its sale to  aCommunications Company controlling  the  Direct  West India  Company and itssubsidiaries.  But I recognise the difficulty of imposing on the  cable  and wirelessinterests concerned any further conditions and restrictions in addition to those whichthey have  already undertaken;  and I  hesitate, therefore,  to suggest  that theseconditions  should be definitely  attached to the sale of the West Indian Telegraphsystem.  In view,  however,  of the great desirability  of safeguarding as far  aspossible the interests of these parts of  the Empire, I recommend that it should  bean  instruction  to  the  Advisory  Committee,  through  which  the  Governmentsconcerned are to exercise control over the Communications Company, to bear these points in mind.
