Minute of conversation with Lord Buxton on the 18th October, 1928.                                                                          C.    Foreign Office, November 13, 1928.                                MEMORANDUM.    1.   THE suggestion has recently been made tentatively to Sir M. Lampson thatthe question of the Boxer Indemnity might be finally  disposed of by releasing all future instalments unconditionally to the Chinese Government.^   It appears thatthis could be effected by a simple resolution of  the House of  Commons without an act of Parliament, but if such a resolution were  passed no conditions  could beattached to the gift.  It was suggested, however, to Sir M. Lampson that we mightobtain in advance from the Chinese Government assurances that they would  apply the money so released to them to the same purposes as those originally contemplated in the 1925 Act of Parliament.    2.   Perhaps the time has now come when we might profitably review our  wholepolicy in regard to the Boxer Indemnity, not feeling ourselves necessarily bound bydecisions previously taken, but prepared to adapt our policy to the altered conditionsif it can be clearly shown that such a new departure would be advantageous.    3.   Six years ago we  decided to return the Boxer  Indemnity to China because it was considered to be both unjust and politically inexpedient to continue to inflictthis penalty upon the present generation of Chinese.   We were also influenced bythe policy of the United States and Japanese Governments, who had decided, to remitthe balance of their indemnities for educational and cultural objects.  Having decided in principle to return the  indemnity, we then sought for means  whereby this act ofgenerosity might be so carried out as to promote friendlier relations and a better understanding between the two peoples.   Our first intention (as embodied in the1925 Act) was to utilise the money for educational and cultural purposes mutuallybeneficial to both countries under the supervision of an advisory committee established in London.  The events of 1925,  and the growth of Nationalist feeling in China,resulted in this proposal, which would have been probably welcomed a year or twoearlier/being criticised in China  as leaving the administration of  the fund almostentirely in British hands.  Being aware of this criticism, the Advisory Committee.which Was in course of being established, decided to send a delegation to China underthe chairmanship of Lord Willingdon  to investigate conditions on the spot.  As aresult, our policy was changed (May 1926) and it was decided to entrust the controlof the funds to an Anglo-Chinese  Board  of Trustees (with a Chinese majority)              * See Annex I, telegram to Peking, No. 256 of September 29, 1928.    4650   [18420]
established  in  China, and selected by the Governments of the  two countries.   Nosooner had that decision been taken than the advance of the Nationalist government from Canton to the Yang-tsze emphasised the partition of China between two rivalGovernments, and made it impossible to secure tlie selection of a board by one Govern-ment without  antagonising the other.   Thus, political conditions in China have prevented our  plans from being carried into  effect.  China  has been  torn by civilwars, and for a period was swept by a wave of communism and of bitter anti-Britishagitation.  There was no Government with whom we could discuss the many culturaland mutually  beneficial  projects that had  been mooted, or with whom we could arrange the appointment  of  trustees, without risk  of becoming  involved in  the domestic feuds that  distracted the country.   Suddenly  (June  1928)  all this  waschanged by  the  triumph  of  the  Nationalist  party and the  establishment  of aNational Government in Nanking. Nothing is ever  certain in China,  but  there seems little doubt that, though there will always be a large measure of local autonomy,the Nanking Government is accepted by  the country at large, and may be acceptedby us as the Government of a united China.     4.  This being so, we are immediately confronted with a fresh crop of problems and difficulties.  Our policy is once again in danger of being outstripped by events.The new Government is  a Nationalist Government, and will only make good  in sofar as it lives  up to Nationalist principles. . It must assert a position of equality with foreign   Powers and shake off the shackles of foreign tutelage and  foreignprivilege imposed upon  China by  the unequal treaties.   The  abolition  of extra-territoriality may yet be some distance  off, but tariff autonomy is to be achievedimmediately, and China&apos;s next step will undoubtedly be to  assume full control ofthe Customs Administration  (not  necessarily dispensing with  the services of  theforeign staff).  The next advance after that will be to take back  into her own handsthe custody of her revenues and the liquidation of the obligations secured upon them.     5.  The Boxer Indemnity was secured upon the customs revenues  in 1901.   In1912 China  agreed to a  temporary  arrangement  whereby those  revenues  were collected by  the foreign commissioners, instead  of  as  heretofore by the nativesuperintendents, and banked in foreign custodian  banks in the name of the  foreignInspector-General of  Customs, instead of remaining  as  heretofore under   theunfettered  control of the  Chinese  officials.   We must foresee  the possibility or rather  the  probability that  in the immediate  future  China will  declare thattemporary arrangement at an  end. We now receive the Boxer Indemnity instal-ments automatically from a foreign custodian bank.  We shall then have to demandpayment of them from a  Chinese official.   In these circumstances, our wisest policy would appear to be to reduce our commitments as much as possible.  If we now setup elaborate machinery for putting the  money under the control of trustees to beused for specific purposes,  it may well turn out that instead of  promoting friendly relations and a good understanding between the two peoples it may prove a potentsource of friction and ill-will.  As a matter of fact, in  the case of the remission of other indemnities, there has already been friction over the Russian and japanese and even the American arrangements.   All the Powers have in principle given up their indemnities, and the  Chinese  have  become accustomed, to regard the money astheirs  rather than  ours.   They may find it  galling  to  their  pride  to be undercompulsion to  pay it even to a board of trustees.   If the  custodian banks were abolished and China refused to pay any more instalments, we should have no meanswhatever of forcing her to do so (even if we thought it  wise  to try), and we shouldbe faced with the task of  liquidating an impossible position.    6.  The question then arises, is there any way of returning this  money to Chinaand yet at the same time achieving our original object of impressing her imaginationand  gaining her friendship by a striking act  of generosity?   There is such a wayif we can take a rapid decision and act on it quickly and dramatically.  We shouldsurrender all future instalments to  China unconditionally by a simple resolution ofthe House of Commons, but we should not dull the edge of this  piece of generosityby endeavouring to extract promises from China as to how she will use the money.We should tell  the Chinese that we return the money unconditionally as a mark ofour friendship, and we leave it to her unfettered discretion to decide how the money should be spent.    7.  Sir M. Lampson has now  replied to  the  telegram referred to in the first paragraph  above.*   His reply anticipates most, if not all,  of  the further points which, in the development of our policy, we would have put to him.  If we hand the         * See Annex II and III, Peking telegrams Nos. 1158 and 1159 of October 18, 1928.
money back, he says, we should do it thoroughly and be quit of all future responsi-bility for its method of expenditure.  This was the  conclusion at which we ourselveshad independently arrived.  But he also sees strong arguments against our proposal,viz., unlikelihood (if funds are uncontrolled) that the money will be devoted to objects of mutual Anglo-Chinese benefit, and probable criticism in British circles against sogenerous a  gift  to  China  when so  many British  debts  are still outstanding.Sir M. Lampson would like to defer giving a definite opinion until he visits Nanking.He thinks that&apos; this  offer might  be  an invaluable lever in his  commercial treaty negotiations.&apos; &apos;    8.  Our own idea had been  that the most effective way of carrying out ourremission policy would be to authorise Sir M. Lampson, on the occasion of his visit to Nanking (if and when he goes-perhaps in a month or six weeks&apos;  time to sign the impending Tariff Autonomy Treaty), to make the announcement at the banquetto which he would be entertained to celebrate the signing of the treaty.  The essence of this plan would be secrecy and dramatic effect.  If it were possible,  therefore, for sir M. Lampson  to make the announcement before the resolution  had been passed in the House, so much the better; if not, then perhaps the resolution could be madeto synchronise Avith the signing of the treaty.    9.  It seems unlikely that the surrender of the  Boxer Indemnity to the NankingGovernment would be resented  by any  other part  of China,  even if  separatisttendencies should once more appear.  The provinces have long since ceased to regard the money being paid into custodian banks as belonging to them, but the Nanking.Governments policy of centralisation of  finances  is  likely  to cause  difficulties inregard to other revenues. If,  therefore, the finances of the Central Government werestrengthened without depleting those of  the provinces, it seems probable  that all parties would be equally pleased.  Further, the stability of the Central Governmentwill  depend in some measure on  the support and  friendship of foreign countries,perhaps especially the support of Great Britain, and an action of this sort at thepresent moment would almost certainly be a very considerable help towards stability.    10.  There remains  the question  of the disposal of that  part of the indemnitywhich has already been paid into the bank on account of  &quot;The China  IndemnityFund &quot; under the provisions of the 1925 Act.  This question is not so urgent, since these funds can only be dealt with by the passing of  an Amending Act.   Lord Buxton,Chairman of the Advisory Committee, who has been confidentially consulted and whoapproves in principle of the foregoing proposal, is inclined to think that this portionof the fund also should be remitted unconditionally  to the Chinese.*    11.  Very roughly,  the accumulated funds already paid amount to  2,500,000;interest thereon to  200,000 ; unpaid balance of the indemnity to  8,500,000 (spreadover years 1928-45).    Far Eastern Department, Foreign Office,               October 17, 1928.                                  ANNEX I.                 Lord Cushendun to Sir M. Lampson (Peking).(No.  256.  Confidential.)(Telegraphic.)                               Foreign Office, September 29, 1928.    YOUB, telegram No.  774 :  Boxer Indemnity fund.    In view  (1) of the delay now inevitably  involved before the passage of  anAmending Act enabling  a  Board of Trustees to be established in China to carryout the recommendations of the Buxton Committee, and (2) of the difficulty of taking any more adequate action under the 1925 Act than possibly that of rendering some slight assistance to a few  Chinese Government students  at present stranded herewithout&apos;funds, I have been  seriously considering whether there are any other meansof putting the whole or Some portion of the fund to immediate use.    I am advised that, while the portion of the indemnity fund already paid to the account of His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot under the terms  of the  1925 Act be released without an Amending Act, the situation with regard to  the as yet unpaidinstalments is  different; and it would be possible to remit these instalments to theChinese Government in virtue of a resolution&apos;passed in  Committee in the House             -  1  *&apos; See Annex IV,1 minute of conversation :W:ithL6ifd Buxton..

of Commons;  such remission would, however, have to be in form spontaneous and unconditional.    This procedure can be adopted far more rapidly than action by Act of Parlia-ment;  and I would accordingly be glad  to have your early views on the followingpoints, which would arise for consideration before a solution on these lines could be envisaged :     (1.) Are there indications that the Nanking  Government are so far stabilising           themselves as  to justify our  handing  over  to them moneys which are           specifically to be devoted to work covering the whole  of China and not           certain provinces only?    (2.) If or when this is the case, would it be reasonably safe to hand over to that           Government  the unpaid instalments unconditionally, but on the under-           standing that when we see what use they put them to, and  are satisfied           that they deal with these sums in accordance with our stated intentions, we;          will take steps to refund to them the sums already paid ?    (3.) Would such a proposal be acceptable of  the reverse?   Would the Nanking           Government  appreciate  being placed upon their mettle in this way, or           would they merely take the occasion of our  friendly  action to clamour           for the immediate remission  of the whole  fund paid and unpaid?    (4.) In the  event of  their spending  the remitted instalments in a manner           which did not satisfy us, would our retention indefinitely of the amount           already paid cause more friction and bad feeling than the delay involved           in  proceeding  on the lines hitherto contemplated, viz., establishment of           a Board of Trustees  in China by Act of Parliament ?    (5.) Have you any  other suggestions to offer for the disposal  of these as yet           unpaid instalments,  bearing in mind that they could under this procedure           only be remitted unconditionally and  without allocation by  ourselves in           advance to any specific purposes, though it would be open to the Chinese           Government at the time of remission to give any unilateral assurances of           undertakings in regard to the  expenditure of the  fund?&apos;         ;.;                                  ANNEX II.          Sir M. Lampson to Lord Cushendun. (Received October 18:)(No. 1158.)                                             &apos;                   &apos;&quot;-(Telegraphic.)1                                       Peking, October 18, 1928.    YOUR telegram No. 256.        . -   -    -   .    I will first endeavour to answer specific questions in paragraph 4.    (1.) Rumours of all sorts are rife and no one can possibly foretell prospects ofdurability of present Government. &apos; But I see no  signs so far of their weakening indeed, rather the contrary.  Feng Yu-hsiang remains the enigma.  If they do fall,the odds are that their successors will  represent much the same thing as they do.  it looks as  though  Manchuria  were gravitating towards  Nanking,  and but for theJapanese she would have joined up ere now.  I fancy,  therefore, that Nanking or itssuccessor are likely to represent all China, at least in name, for some time, but I donot pretend  that there is a chance  of their  exercising effective  control over theprovinces for a long time to come.     (2.)  If by &quot;safely&quot; is  meant:  &quot;Would  Nanking  Government necessarilyadhere to any understanding of the kind indicated,&quot;  the answer is in the negative.No Chinese Government can be trusted to keep their word if it happens to suit themto break it.    (3.) I  should say, undoubtedly acceptable.  It might appeal to men like  Soongand C. T, Wang to be put on their mettle, but it is quite likely that they might  alsopress for return of all funds.   It is the nature of all Chinese to ask for more; give aninch and they ask for an ell.     (4.) Impossible to say, but probably not.    My general comment follows in my immediately  following telegram.
ANNEX III.Sir M. Lampson to Lord Cushendun. (Received October 18.)Peking, October 18, 1928.-(No. 1159.)(Telegraphic.)    MY immediately; preceding telegram.    In  favour of proposal,  main arguments seem to me:  (a) That it would savemuch future potential friction, and once we have made  up our minds to hand themoney back, we should do well to do it thoroughly and be quit of all future responsi-bility for method of  its expenditure.  This  argument greatly attracts me.   It  is emphasised  by the fact that America at this very moment is having violent frictionwith Nanking over that portion of her  return of indemnity  known as China f ounda-tion.  A record of a conversation on this with United States Minister went to you inmy despatch No.  1200 of 8th October,  (b) Political effect,  if just at this time whenorder may  be said  to have evolved  out  of  chaos  and Nationalist  government established itself we were to  show them this startling act  of generosity.    2.  In short, there may be a strong case for more or less unconditional remissionboth in consideration of long view and avoidance of future friction and of immediate effect, which could hardly fail to be favourable throughout all China.    3.  Arguments against the proposal are  also  strong.  They  centre really onundesirability of returning vast sum of money to  unfettered control when we know from  painful experience m - the past  how hopelessly dishonest and inefficient allprevious Chinese  Governments have been in matters of finance.  That there is thuslittle likelihood of money being devoted to objects of  mutual Anglo-Chinese benefit,and that finally, with so many British  debts outstanding, so generous a free gift toChinese of British taxpayers&apos; money would be unjustifiable and would raise a stormof criticism throughout all the British community.    4.  I cannot  at the moment pretend to say which line  of argument has it, andwould much  prefer to let the matter stand over until I have visited Nanking, whenmy mind would become  clearer.  Tor instance, knowledge that this  offer was  apractical possibility might give me an invaluable lever if it  becomes later a questionof general commercial treaty negotiations.  Again, if  it were a question of practical politics some assurance from the Chinese that they would place big orders in GreatBritain  for  inevitable reconstruction work, such as railway materials, &amp;c, would,&apos;I imagine, take the sting out  of much criticism of an unconditional remission.  These,however, are ideas which I only throw out tentatively pending seeing things formyself at Nanking if I succeed in going there.    5.  At the back of my mind I feel we might be able to do a favourable deal overour various treaty difficulties if we had this bait in reserve.  At the moment Nankingis desperately in need of money.    (Repeated nowhere.)                                 ANNEX IV.          Minute of Conversation with Lord Button, October 18, 1928.    I  SHOWED  a draft  of  the departments  memorandum on the proposedunconditional  remission  of  the unpaid instalments of the Boxer Indemnity toLord Buxton this morning.    Lord Buxton  stated that he would,  of course, much prefer  that  the  recom-mendations  of  the  Advisory Committee should be carried out, yet  if there wasno real  immediate  prospect of  the introduction  of an  Amending Bill  in  theHouse of Commons, his first impression was that the proposal had much in its favour.He agreed that the remission  of  the  instalments,  if made, should be absolutelyunconditional.  As regards the  accumulated  2-^ million of paid indemnity,  he  didnot consider that it would be worth while, nor indeed easy, to create a Board of trustees to deal only with this  reduced amount of the fund.  The  proposals of thecommittee were founded  on. the assumption of  11 million, and it would be verydifficult and invidious to cut them down to  2^ million.  It would  be better,  hethought,  to treat the remaining  2-1 million more or less in the same way  as  the
instalments, when eventually an Act of Parliament was passed to deal with them.It might possibly, he thought, be advantageous, without asking for a definite pledgeon the matter, that, when this money was handed over to the Chinese Government,the British Government  should  indicate that,  in the opinion  of  the  AdvisoryCommittee, which consisted both of Chinese and British members, the money should be expended for educational purposes.  The Chinese Government might be quite willingto give some undertaking to that effect, which would certainly ease the passage ofthe Amending Bill through the House.    Lord Buxton wanted, however, to consider further the question of  the  best method of dealing with the  2^ million. He is of opinion that if the Foreign Officeapprove  of the proposal  as regards the unpaid instalments, it is only proper  thatit should be submitted to the British  members of his committee here before  any announcement on the subject is actually made.  Although the proposal would involvethe scrapping of much careful and laborious  work, he would,  in present circum-stances, be disposed to recommend them to adopt it.October 18, 1928.F.
