IS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY QI HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  COVBRNMBNT)OUST.p.  307 (28) -                                       COPY NO.               CAB I M E T.           ROHAN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF, THE BOARD Off  &apos;                 EDUCATION.     With reference to my recent Memorandum on ChurchSchools (CP. 276 (20) ), my colleagues may be interested to see the attached report of a speech &quot;by the roman catholic Archbishop of Cardiff, which Indicates theattitude which one or two of the Roman CatholicBishops are taking.    The Archbishop is, I believe,a strong Conservative and this makes the speech allthe more significant.                                  E. P.Board of Education,.    17th October. 1926.
                                                         II      SPQRiP of SPEECH made &quot;by the AHCHBlSIIOP of CAfiDOT                 on the 7th OCTOBER,- 1928.       &quot;parents have many duties to fulfil towards their children, but one of the most important duties whichrests upon thorn is to see that thoir children are properly educated.        3y being educated we do not mean having them.taught merely reading, writing, and arithmetic, but wemean having all their faculties developed, and particularly the religious faculty.        Now, It is incumbent on the State to respect thesolemn duties of parents.   It is even incumbent on theState when necessary to help the parents to carry out their duties to thoir qhildreUc   It is evident that theBritish Government recognises this fact to a certain extent as. regards the education of tho children of theworking class in England and Wales.        I have said 1 to a certain extent&apos; for the reason that while the Government undertake to pay the teachers,and to meet the current expenses of all recognisedprimary schools, it is not willing to pay anythingtowards the erection of school buildings, except for those parents who do not wish their children to receive any definite religious Instruction.        Those parents who want their children to receivedefinite religious instruction must build and pay for,their own school buildings.        In other words, we Catholics,  who insist upon cur.                       \              ISchildren being taught the Christian and the Catholic ,religion during the time that they receive their seculareducation,  must as a result build our own schools  and pay the whole cost.                    - 1 -
        Is this what we should expect fron the Governmentof a Christian country?   Is this what we should expectfrom a country which boasts of justice and freedom of religious thought - a country which claims to have regard for the conscientious feelings of all Its subjects?        For many yoars now, our poor people havo willinglygathered together their hard-oamed wages;  and they have paid thousands and thousands of pounds in building Catholicschools throughout the country.   This has always been a heavy burden upon Catholics, who, for the most part,belong to the poorest section of the community.   Now,however,  that the price of building has increased soenormously, it has become a burden too great for us tobear.        We simply cannot continue to build our schools and pay the whole of the cost of them.   It is to our Govern-ment that we look either to build our schools, or, at anyrate, to share with us the burden of building them.        The least that tho Government can do for us Is topay us a substantial rent for the use of our school buildings as part of their school machinery&apos; so that by  .means of this rent we can pay tho interest on the moneywe have to borrow, and gradually extinguish the capitaldebt that we have Incurred.        It may be of interest to you to know that theerection of this school,  together with the site,  will cost no less than  19,000,  which is equivalent in the city of Cardiff to a threepenny rate.    This will give you some idea of how Catholics are being penalised,  and show youhow much  we are saving the  rates  and taxes  of thecountry,  while, in addition,  we are paying  our share  ofthese rate3 and taxes.                    - 2 -
        If the nembers of our present Government are not willing to help us as regards building our schools;  ifthoy will not recognise the injustice under which we are suffering, and if they will not give us any redress,then let us take the first opportunity we have of trying to find others who will aot more in conformity with what we know as British justice.        Uext spring or summer we shall have an opportunityof doing this when the General Eleotion takes place.        Doubtless, we shall be asked for cur vote by representatives of various part ids, but let our first question be before any party questions are touched upon:&apos;Vshat will you do for us as regards our Catholic schools?Will you insist upon the leaders of your party bringing ina Bill to put an end to the present Injustice underwhich we suffer as regards the building and paying for ourschool buildings, and will you vote for the passing ofsuch a Bill?&apos;        It Is true that we are in a minority in thiscountry, but it is wonderful what we can do if we areroally united, and if we aot as one man.        Our voting power is much greater now than it hasover boeh, and I feel certain that if we are faithful tocur Catholic children, and if we are faithful to ourCatholio schools, wo oan obtain justice and fair play asregards the education of our Catholic children.        Wo must,  however, be united, and oven be preparedif necessary to put party feelings on one side..   without this we shall never gain our end,  and we shall still haveto groan under the injustice of paying for our Catholicschools.               J)
        Let us hope that a Bill of relief will soon heours, hut let us also hope that this Bill will he,  soto speak, retrospectiro, that is to aay,  may it not  onlyaffect future schools, but also be so framed that  itwill help your present good priest at St. Mary&apos;s to  paythe huge cost of this school which is now being built&quot;.i
