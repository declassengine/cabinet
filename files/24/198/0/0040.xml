DOCUMENT IS THE&quot; PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT^ hC R E T.                   .                      copy no cabinet the WEST INDIAN SABLE AND TIRELESS SYSTEM.Memor andtim by the Se cretary of State for              Scotland. 1.    The  Cabinet at its last meeting postponed        \ consideration of the points raised by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in his memorandum (CP.328 (28)) on the West Indian Cable and Wireless System, owing to my unavoidable absence. 2.    In paragraph 4 of this memorandum the Colonial Secretary tabulates six conditions which in his view would have  been Necessary had the system been transferred to the direct West India Company.   These conditions are stated to oe j-       (a)  A definite undertaking to continue the services               now performed by the Government system at               rates not in excess of the present rates for               a period of, say, 25 j^ears, without payment               of any subsidy.       (b)  A definite undertaking not to transfer the               ownership or control of any of their West Indian               cables or wireless stations without- the               consent of the Government.       (c)  Cancellation of the objectionable clauses in               the agreement of 1870 between the Cuba               Submarine Company and the West Indian and               Panama Company, and any connected or               subsidiary agreements.       (d)  An undertaking t-s avoid as far as possible               taking British West Indian traffic through               foreign territory or through stations or               lines under foreign control.       (e)  An arrangement for taking over the Carriaoou and               Montserrat wireless stations at eost priae,               less any amount in the Sinking Fund, and for               their operation as part of the system.       (f)  Substitution of landing licences for a term of,               say, 25 years, for those licences of the West               India and Panama Company- wl-ii^h. ooxrtain no Itmit-               of time and are claimed to be in por-po-tuit-y-
9 i QSJI .L U3.   In the altered circumstances due to the creation of the communications Company most of these  conditions willbe covered by the general arrangements recommended bythe Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference.   For example,the Communications Company is required to consult  thoImperial Advisory Committee &quot;on questions of policy including any alteration in rates&quot; and &quot;no increase of rates prevailing at the date of the formation of the Communications company is to be made except with the assent of the AdvisoryCommittee&quot;.   Further it is proposed that an undertakingshould be given by the Coimnuni cations Company &quot;not to dispose, or allow any serious diminution in the controlof their communications assets&quot;.   Also &quot;British controlof all the companies must be guaranteed.&quot;4.   The proposals mentioned above cover the specificconditions raised in (a) and (b) and in part, that raised in (dl of the Colonial Secretary fs memorandum.5.   The point raised at (c) -Cancellation of the objeotion-able clauses in the Agreement of 1870&quot; - is one which willrequire examination by legal experts.   It would appear,however, that it would be In the interests of theCoiTimuni cations Company to cancel these clauses and it may beleft to them to secure this result if it Is legally possible.6.   With regard to (d) it is not possible to require an absolute undertaking from the Compaq to avoid takingtraffic through foreign territory or stations.   commercial considerations must be taken into consideration,  but It  willbe observed that before any major alterations in the existing services are effected, the Advisory Committee has tobe consulted.
7.   I understand that the Oarriaoou and Montserratwireless stations referred to in (e) above are atpresent operated by the Paoific Cable Board on behalfof tho local Governments oohoeraed, and there seems noreason why the Communications Conpany should not continue doing so on terms to be agreed unless somebetter arrangement suggests itself.8.   I do not know what implications are Involved In(f) - the substitution of landing licences for a termof 25 years in lieu of those which contain no tinelimit and are claimed in perpetuity.   It would appearthat legal considerations are involved, which would need to be examined before it oan be ascertained whether such a course Is feasible.9.   The Imperial Wireless and Cable Conferencerecommended that the Colonial Offioe should berepresented on the Advisory Committee,  and the representa-tive of this Department will be able to raise these points at the appropriate tine.                    (3d.)  JOHN GIIMOira.Scottish Offioe,  S.W.1,       November 12th,  1928.
