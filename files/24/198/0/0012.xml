[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j                Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy Mo.-   ^0O.P. 312 (28).                                 CABINET *UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE  BILL.                  MEMORANDUM BY  THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.     THE purpose of  this Bill, for the introduction of which sanction was given on the 1st October (Cabinet 45 (28), Conclusion 4), wili be to increase the borrowing powers of the Unemployment Fund beyond the present limit of   30,000,000.  Theattached note,  which has been prepared in my Department,  sets out the relevantfigures, and calls attention to the serious financial position of the Fund.     It is clear that the borrowing powers must be increased by  10,000,000     upto a total of  40,000,000).  With any  substantially less slim we should run grave risk of having to go to Parliament again for more money before the election next year.     The other point which arises in connection with the Bill is that of the adjustment of the revenue and expenditure of the  Unemployment Fund.   It presents peculiardifficulties.     The main features of the question are these.  It is beyond all ordinary probability that at the present rates of contributions and benefits the income will balance theexpenditure of the Fund in the near future.   I have taken into consideration allthe factors which (from this point of view), can be considered favourable :  (1) the beneficial effect on industry of-the Government Rating proposals; (2)  the energeticmeasures  that have been initiated  for  transferring and emigrating  men fromdistressed areas;  (3) the effect of the new &apos;&apos; 30 contribution rule &apos;&apos; in limiting thenumber of those entitled to benefit;  and (4) the general improvement in trade whichit might be reasonable to expect as the effects of the coal  strike  begin to wear off.Given the maximum effect of these ameliorative influences,  what will be the result ?Will they cause the average level of unemployment throughout the year to be 300,000lower than at present;  in fact, to be as low as the lowest  point ever reached sincethe great &apos;&apos; slump &apos;&apos; ?  The answer  is obviously &apos;&apos; No.&apos;&apos;   To count on such a resultin the coming year would not be optimism but self-deception.  Yet that would haveto be the effect for  the Fund to balance.    In other  words, the  overwhelmingprobability is that (unless benefits are further reduced),  an increase in the income of the Fund will become necessary  in the near future.     What, then, are the alternatives open to us 1     (1.) The  obvious course is to increase subscriptions at once.  It is the naturalcourse.  On every occasion, without exception, up to the present, when the borrowing powers have been increased subscriptions have also- been increased. On the other hand,I can appreciate the great difficulties which my colleagues may feel with regard tosuch action at the present moment difficulties  which need not be elaborated here.     (2.) What is the alternative ?   The state  of  the Fund and of the income andexpenditure is a matter of public knowledge. It cannot be concealed.  Will it suffice for the Government to give a pledge,  however  stringently worded, that they intend to keep the Fund solvent, and  that, if the hoped-for improvement in industry doesnot sufficiently materialise, they will take steps to ensure the solvency ?     Such a course is open to difficulties as great as the first though of another kind.The opposition can quote against us our  own criticisms Of the Bill of 1924, when wecomplained that it gave no guarantee of solvency, but at best a statement of intention.Yet the position then was not nearly so bad as it is to-day.   Any deficiency of incomeat all was then problematical.  To-day the  deficiency  is already large   and is increasing.  We should clearly be open to a damaging attack.     (3.) The dilemma would seem almost complete.  There is, however, a way out,which, though, not without difficulties of its own, would indicate adherence to our     - [18340]
traditional financial policy and would reaffirm the doctrine (in a way that we may find most useful later on) that Governments  proposing  to give benefits under theSocial Service  schemes must ask  concurrently  for  the necessary  revenue.  Thesuggestion is not to make any increase of contributions at the moment,  but to take powers in the Bill to do so should it be subsequently found to be necessary.    Though not likely, it is yet not wholly inconceivable that if all favourable factorsdo, in fact, combine to cause an improvement in trade  and employment, the necessitymay not arise for increasing contributions.  It  might be argued that if some improve-ment  is likely and sufficient.improvement is not  impossible,  it would be absurd to upset industry and possibly retard that improvement  by  a premature increase.  Onthe other hand, the insertion of powers in the Bill is a real earnest of the Govern-ment&apos;s purpose to  observe the principles  of  sound finance  and to keep the fundsolvent.    The sort of clause which I have in mind would give the Minister of Labour power with the consent of the Treasury to raise additional revenue if at the expiration ofone year from the passing of the Act the Debt is at or above  30,000,000, or if atany earlier date it appeared that the  borrowing powers of  40,000,000 were in danger of being exhausted.   There would have to be a limit fixed  in the Bill to theamount by which contributions could be  increased, and I suggest  a maximum limit of ftd. weekly.  It would, of course, be  explained that the additional contribution(which in the circumstances would have to be divided equally between employers,employed and the Exchequer) would be a supplementary contribution, which would cease so soon as the Debt is paid off.                                                   (Initialled)       A.  S. M.    Ministry of Labour, October 22, 1928.                                  ENCLOSURE.                      Unemployment Insurance Bill,  1928.    THE Unemployment Insurance Acts limit the amount which may be borrowedfrom the Treasury by the Unemployment Fund to  30,000,000.    The total amount owing to the  Treasury on the 12th October was  28,055,000.*In recent years the debt has fluctuated as follows : 	 		 Dec. 31, 1923 ...	... 12,497,000	Sept. 30, 1926 ...	... 16,790,000Mar. 31, 1924 ...	... 10,157,000	Dec. 31, ,,	... 22,640,000June 30, ,,	6,829,000	Mar. 31, 1927 ...	... 24,710,000Sept. 30, ,,	... 4,501,000	June 30, ,,	... 24,160,000Dec. 31,	5,094,000	Sept. 30, ,,	... 22,660,000Mar. 31, 1925 ...	... 7,114,000	Dec. 31, ,,	... 23,180,000June 30, ,,	7,7.76,000	Mar. 31, 1928 ...	... 24,530,000Sept. 30, ,,	... 7,611,000	June 30, ,,	... 25,680,000Dec. 31, ,,	7,263,000	Sept. 30, ,,	... 27,695,000*Mar. 31, 1926 ...	7,178,000	Oct. 12, ,, ...	... 28,055,000*June 30, ,,	9,948,000		   * The figures for September 30 and October 12 include  665,000 and  855,000 respectively, owing for adminsitrative expenses, but unpaid under Treasury direction.    The weekly contributions to the Unemployment Fund were under the Act of1925 reduced by 4ii. per week in the case of men (employers and employed 2d. each)in order to facilitate the inception of the new pensions  scheme.  Against this it wasenacted that the Exchequer should pay an additional contribution, which wouldhave been 2\d.  per week until January 1928 (say  4,000,000 per annum) and l\d.since.   The Economy Act, 1926, repealed this  obligation on the Exchequer, and reduced the then existing Exchequer  contribution from Q\d. to Qd.  per  week theassumption being that the Fund did not need the revenue.  The net effect of these changes is to reduce  the available revenue of the  Fund  by  about  9,000,000  perannum.  Had they not  been made, the  debt of the Unemployment Fund would atpresent (12th  October, 1928)  be round about  4,000,000,  notwithstanding  the prolonged and severe  depression which has been experienced.    The revenue of the Fund is at present about  42,000,000.  With contributionsat their present rates, and allowing for interest on a debt  of  30,000,000, the fund would balance with a live register of  rather less than  1,000,000.  The live register
(1st October) is 1,336,400.  With such a register the Fund will incur  further debtat the rate of about  270,000 per week, and the borrowing powers will  be exhaustedabout the end of November.   (Assuming that the non-payment of  administrative expenses is continued, the borrowing powers will not be exhausted until the beginningof January.  In such case, there would then be  2,000,000 owing to the  Treasury for administration expenses, which would be a first charge on the new borrowing powers.It should be noted that the non-payment of administrative expenses is irregular andwill be even harder to justify, if continued for more  than a minimum  period afterParliament meets.)Additional Borrowing  Powers.     It is necessary to introduce and pass a Bill to increase the borrowing powers atthe earliest possible moment.   In considering the amount of the increase,  regard should be had to the following table, which shows until  what date (approximately)the increase  will last on  certain assumptions as  to the Live Register and  on theassumption that there is no change in contributions or benefits.Maximum Borrowing&apos; Powers. .	Live Register, 1,200,000.	Live Register, 1,300,000.	Live Register, 1,400,000. 35,000,000 (increase of  5,000,000)	September 1929 ..	May 1929	March 1929. 40,000,000 (increase of  10,000,000) ..	March 1980	September 1929 ..	June 1929.(See footnote * as to the&apos; effect of the 30-contribution rule.)     Although it is advisable to increase the borrowing powers as little as possible,an increase of  5,000,000 would give no assurance that a Bill for a further increase would not be required in the first half of 1929.   An increase  of  10,000,000  seemstherefore unavoidable.Need for Additional  Revenue, or Reduction of Benefits.     In considering&apos;whether any proposed maximum borrowing power is reasonable in relation to a given annual revenue, the primary question is whether it is prudent to expect-that the live register will, within reasonable time, be and remain sufficientlybelow balancing point to secure substantial and steady repayment of debt.  With a heavy debt  and the experience of recent years it is not prudent to  rely on a  smallmargin of repayment.     On each previous occasion when borrowing powers were increased, the revenuewas  raised to such an amount as seemed at the time to offer a reasonable prospect of paying off a large portion of the debt at no distant date.  In the past the relation ofthe  borrowing  powers  to the  amount of the revenue  at  the time of the  relevantlegislation has been as follows : 	Revenue.		MaximumAct.	Per Week per Man.	Amount per Annum.	Borrowing Powers.1920 .. 1921 (No. 1) .. 1921 (No. 2) .. 1922 .. 1925 and Economy Act 1926 1927 ..	Pence. 10 13ft 18  25f 21 - 24	  20,000,000 26,500,000 36,500,000 49,000,000$ 42,650,000 42,000.000	  10,000,000 20,000.000 30,000,000 30,000,000 30,000,000    * The effect of the operation of the &quot;30-contribution&quot; rule commencing on the 19th April next will beto reduce gradually over the ensuing twelve months the number of persons receiving benefit. The incidence of the rule must vary from time to time.  Its financial effect cannot be relatively large in the calendar year1929.  If the effect in that period is to reduce the Live Register on the average by 50,000, this would saveabout  1,500,000 by the 31st December, 1929.    t Never operative.    1 This Act reduced the contribution for young persons.    S Owing to the substantial increase in the number of insured persons since 1922, the revenue from a-contribution of 25jrf. would now be nearly  52,000,000.
     A  debt amounting  to   30,000,000  involves  a  charge on  the revenue  of  1,500,000 per annum.  Each  5,000,000 by which the debt is increased raises the annual interest charge by  250,000, so that  a debt of  40,000,000 would mean paying  2,000,000 per annum interest.  This equals a contribution of Id. per week.     With a debt of  40,000,000 nothing would be available for repayment, except in so far as the Live Register falls below 980,000, which would be the new balancing point.   Even if one could be certain that an increase  of the borrowing powers  by  10,000,000 to  40,000,000 would be the last increase that is necessary, the prospect of repayment of the debt  without additional revenue or reduction in benefits would be gloomy enough.  As will be seen from  the above,  it is  necessary to face  the possibility that  40,000,000 may have  to  be  exceeded in  1929.   The  longer  the revision of the finance of the Fund is postponed, the more likely is it that the position will become unmanageable, and the greater the  chance of a large bad debt being left on the  hands of the Treasury.   This points  to the advisability of a substantial increase of revenue now,  or to a decrease of benefits should that be considered  the better alternative.     A decrease of Is.  per week  in the rate of  benefit for men and women (Qd.  forother classes) would save approximately  168,000 per annum per 100,000 on the Live Register.   With a Live Register of, say, 1,300,000,  this would save   2,200,000 perannum. This is slightly more than equivalent to the product of an additional Id. onthe contributions.  It would raise the balancing point by 50,000.     Assuming the present benefits and a total debt round  about  30,000,000, thetotal contributions required to achieve various balancing points are as follows : Live Register.1,000,0001,050,0001,100,0001,150,0001,200,0001,250,0001,300,0001,350,0001,400,000Pence per week.    21 (the  present rate).    22.    23.    24.    25.    26.    27.    28.    29    It is recognised that the provision of additional revenue at the present time is.attended With difficulties j1 but, on general grounds, it is easier to propose additional revenue when the Live Register is high and the borrowing powers must be raised,than it would be later.    As the Minister pointed out in his Memorandum of the 19th July to the Cabinet(CP. 244/28), it is necessary to &quot; re-examine the finances of  the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme, for we dearly cannot contemplate the continuance of a burden of debt of  this kind, pointing as it does to a wrong relationship between revenue and.expenditure.  The load of Unemployment which we have carried, and are carrying,,requires either a higher level of  contributions or a lower level of benefits.&quot;o
