S DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * 3 GOVERNMENT.1?ST.CABINET,P. 555 (28),.UNEMPLOYMENT.  INSURANCE.COPY NO:J850 C0NTRIBU7 LOSS RULE.,Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.   Statements in the Press within  the last  three  days make methink that I ought to bring to  the notice of  my  colleagues  a.matter which may now become urgent at any moment by reasons of    .representations being made that prompt Government action  isnecessary to prevent large numbers of people  from losing  unem-ployment benefit.   There are indications already that something of the kind may be expected not merely from the  Opposition but from the Government side of the House.2.   The Unemployment Insurance Act  passed last  year provides thatbeginning in April, 1929, unemployed persons  shall  not be entitledto receive benefit under the Insurance scheme unless they have paid 50 contributions during tine preceding two years.     Thisfollows the unanimous recommendation of the   Blanesburgli  Committee.That Committee proposed that the new requirement should come intoforce after a short transitional period  in  fact,  the period of transition which has been allowed is substantially  longer thanthat contemplated by the Committee.3.   Exaggerated estimates have been given by prejudiced  parties of the numbers who will be &quot;struck off&quot; benefit  as  the result ofthe rule.  The fact Is that it Is not possible at the moment tosay with any pretence to accuracy what the numbers   will  be.  This,however, can be said with certainty?  the rule comes into operationgradually over the year from April,  1929, to April, 1930, and willnot cover the whole field until tiie  latter date*    Its effect forsome time after April, 1929, will be quite small.4.   A special return was obtained by my Department as at 10thSeptember last from all the Local Offices of  the Ministry showinghow many people would have been disqualified for the receipt ofbenefit If the rule had been put into full force and effect ontB^BBDItttsiBm
that date - that is, without allowing a year for its gradualoperation.   l&apos;his, of course, as I have nentioned,  is notwhat would happen;  the rule does in fact begin to  workgradually.   &apos;i&apos;he return was a 10 Jo sample of the persons inreceipt of benefit on 10th September,   ri&apos;he number  of malesincluded in the sample was 88,809.   Of this number it was found that 12,844 would not have fulfilled the condition ifit had been fully applied on that date.   ihis amounts to14.5 of the sample.   rilhe number of females included in thesample was 18,841.   Of this number 1,007 or 5,5/6 would have failed to fulfil the condition.    Assuming in the absence ofa complete return and of any other basis for estimation,  thatthe sample accurately represents the whole, the positionwould be that rather less than 130,000 men and about 10,000women would have failed to satisfy the condition on10th September.5.   fi&apos;.he so numbers do not represent what will actually happen in the first place there are quite a number of people wholast September had 5, 10 or 20 contributions and werecollecting more towards the necessary 30.   Xgain,  theefforts which we are making to transfer the unemployed fromthe black spots will certainly have an effect,  and  the longerthis movement continues the more the pace will accelerate.In addition, there are proposals now before the Cabinet  fora new form of relief works, which it is hoped will  furtherassist towards a solution.   All these efforts are  directedtovfards getting people away from the x^l&amp;oes where they donot stand muoh chance of acquiring their 30 contributionsqualification, to other places where they will have areasonable opportunity to do so./
6.   There is also the possibility of a general improvementof trade,&apos;   It may be tiiat we cannot rely on a sufficientimprovement in.this direotion to make a great deal of difference in the position, but it would be a mistake to makea pessimistic assumption in this respect until we are muchnearex&quot; the time when the rule will oome into operation.-7.    &apos;JL1 these things indicate that it would be a great mistake to take any precipitate action now,   I should myselfregard any modification of tho 30 contributions rule as adisaster.   Tho problem is really one of local Government -whether local /provision can and should be made for theisolated areas on which the new ocmtribution/Jaay be found topress with undue severity.8.   The question which may ultimately have tc be faoed quiteseriously is the method of dealing with &amp; number &apos;.f pocketsin a comparative!?/ few areas where there are fair numbers of people who will not satisfy the rule.   It would, however,obviously be a big mistake to make any general grant of aoonoession which would be applicable everywhere so long asthe problem is merely to relieve places where the pocketsexist.   what we shall have to do will be tu concentrate on those places when tho time comes.
