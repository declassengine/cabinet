DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .   RET.   -               CABINET..  541  (28).              THE  INDIAN  CONTRIBUTION  TO  THE HOME  EFFECTIVE              Memorandum by the  Secretary  of State  for India,         The  legal position having  been established  by the    Cabinet Committee  (see  their  Report CP.  338 (28)),  I want    to  explain to  my colleagues,  as briefly as  possible,  the    difficulties which Lord Birkenhead and  I have  felt in this    case and  to endeavour to  remove some  of the misunderstandings    which have arisen  regarding the unwillingness  of the  Government    of  India  to agree  to  what,  on the  face  of it,  seems  to be  the    reasonable proposal that  the  amount of  the  Capitation Rate    should be determined  by arbitration.         The  position  is  this.    Three years ago,  when the Secretary    of  State  for War presented  his  demand for a largely Increased    payment,  the Government of  India protested  strongly against any    Increase  and raised the old contention  that India should be    exempted  from  these payments  altogether.   Lord  Birkenhead    pointed out to them that  In view of past decisions It would be    difficult to justify  the  revival of the primary  issue of    principle, but the Government of India  felt themselves bound,  in    the changed circumstances,  to attack  the larger  issue as they  were    convinced that the old  grounds  on  which the capitation payments    had been  objected  to  In the past were stronger now than they were    before, adding that they  had  certain  new material on  which  they    confidently relied for  the  rectification of what they and their    predecessors had always regarded as an  Injustice to  India.    without prejudice  to  the  larger Issue,  Lord Birkenhead asked the    Government of  India to  examine  the claim of the  Secretary  of State     for Tsar on business lines and this the  Government of  India,  not    without some reluctance,  have done.  Early this year the
                                                              991                                                              O w Jt.Government of India,  in a reasoned, despatch&apos; set out the grounds  onwhich they claimed that the Capitation Rate should he abolished.I need not trouble my colleagues with the arguments usedj,  but Ishould like to quote  the concluding paragraph of the Government  ofIndia&apos;s despatch.   They said:     &quot;We trust that we shall,  at any rate, convince Your Lordship   of the j\xstice  and strength of our case as now presented and   may reckon upon your support in Its further prosecution.   As   has already been indicated,  we desire that on this occasion a   determined effort  should be  made to press the matter to a   definite and final decision on the merits.   We do not  seek   another settlement by compromise,  for we wish to preclude once   and for all a revival of the regrettable controversies  of the   past..   As to the  best means of securing finality, we naturally   feel that in the interests  of the Empire, as well as of India,   the most desirable consummation would be that His.Majestyfs   Government should  immediately and of their own volition concede   our claim;  but if that should not be possible we would then   urge very strongly that a decision should not be taken without   the whole matter being reviewed either by the Statutory   Commission itself  or by some independent tribunal linked In some   suitable manner with the proceedings and report to be submitted   to Parliament of the Statutory Commission.   The intimate   knowledge of Indian affairs which we anticipate the Commission   will acquire and the views,  whatever they may be, which it must   necessarily formulate as regards the future relations between   India and the rest of the British Empire, cannot fail to have  a   clear and important bearing on, among other things, the question   of the military defence of India and consequently on all the   questions which are involved in the present system of India&apos;s   capitation payments&quot;.                                 -2-
9O /-j iifi     The attitude, then, of the Government of India is this,that, while prepared to submit the larger question to investi-gation by the Statutory Commission (among other questions affecting the relations between Great Britain and India), theydo not desire, until the major claim is out of the way, that^he amount of the Capitation Sate should either he settled by compromise or be submitted to arbitration.   This attitude,which, I suggest, is not an unreasonable one, was endorsed by Lord Birkenhead for reasons which I shall explain later,and I am convinced that my Council would take the same view.If, on the major issue, an award unfavourable to India weregiven, I have little doubt that the amount to be paid could be settled without muoh difficulty and, as my colleagues are aware, an undertaking has been given that, to any decisionultimately reached, retrospective effect from April,  1926shall be given.     In the despatch from which I have quoted, many of theweightier arguments used by the Government of India went tosupport, not so much a claim that the Capitation Rate assuch should be abolished,  as a claim that a contribution towards military expenditure in India should be made fromImperial Revenues and  I consider it desirable that, if theclaim of the Government of India be referred to any tribunal,it should be stated in this general way.   This indeed wasone of the reasons why-Lord Biricenhead suggested that thematter should be referred to the Statutory Commission, asalthough that body may not be the most appropriate toexamine the narrower question of the Capitation Rate, itseems eminently suited to examine the wider question. 1  It is indeed inevitable that the question of military expenditurein India will be brought prominently to its notice and will .be dealt with in its report to Parliament.
                                                           -  *! Q 9                                                             t) *V c*     In conclusion I wish to put before my Colleagues the considerations which seem to tae - as they seemed to LordBirkenhead - to make it most Inadvisable to attempt to impose a settlement by force on the Government of India, even if i could persuade my Council to do so.   It must always beremenbored that the Government of India, unlike the dominions governments, have not got a majority in their Legislature,and that therefore an assent given by the Secretary of state in Council, or even by the Government of India themselves,does not necessarily carry with it the assent of theLegislature.     The Government of India (in the despatch from which I havealready quoted) have stated that &quot;the budget estimates- for nextyear which provide for the capitation charge on the existingscale indicate great difficulty in framing a balanced budgetwithout extra taxation, and we can assure your Lordship thata balanced account will at best be attainable only at thecost of postponing many admittedly urgent items of civil expenditure.   To impose extra taxation at a time whenfinancial canons would suggest readjustments of taxation in adownward direction as the proper and desirable course is sufficiently objectionable:  to impose extra taxation for thepurpose of meeting military expenditure - other than actualwar expenditure - would In the opinion of the Government ofIndia be quite impracticable, and we have framed our financial proposals for next year on this basis.   TheLegislature would never agree to taxation for such a purpose,and it must be borne in mind that, though the Legislatureunder the present constitution are not permitted to regulate the amount of military expenditure, they have been given theauthority to express by their vote In the first instance
whether the ways and means required to finance such expenditure should he given or withheld.   They have not,- it is true, thefinal power to determine the grant or refusal of ways and means,hut it would he impolitic and dangerous to ignore the consequences which may he entailed by their exercise against Government of thovery important discretion conferred upon them.&quot;  It is true thatif the legislature rejected the taxation Bill I could direct the Viceroy to certify it.   There is no.caso on record of a secretary of State directing an unwilling Viceroy.to use his power of certification, and my Colleagues do not need to be toldwhat the effect of doing so would be on the political situationin India.     The fact that the Viceroy was acting under the orders ofHis MajestyTs Government could not remain unknown,, and in itIndian political opinion would see the confirmation of one ofits most deeply rooted beliefs.   &quot;We have been impressing upon this House&quot; said a member of the Legislative Assembly, (incidentally a loyal supporter of the Simon Commission) a year or two ago,&quot;that the military policy of the Government of India was beingdictated from outside.  We are to-day presented with this spectacleof the British battalions marohing on the  prostrate form of&quot; theGovernment of India.   The Army In India is an Imperial reserve for which the people of this oountry are made to pay.  TheColonies refuse to pay for it; -the British tax-payers refuse topay for it, and therefore, the Army in England is sent out to thiscountry to be paid for by the people, of this country for externalImperial purposes.   That is the situation.   How far this house will keep on financing from year to  year this insatiableMoloch of military expenditure can only be answered not byHis Excellency the Commender-in-Chief nor by the Government ofIndia but by the War Office and the Imperial Cabinet responsiblefor the defence of the British Empire.   This, I submit,  is -
9 9a situation ox abject helplessness not on  the part of theMembers of this House only but on the part of the distinguishedoccupants of the Treasury Benches.   His Excellency theConmander-in-Chief, the Government of India, and the military advisers of the Government of India recommended a reduction, aswe now see from the papers.j but the War Office have vetoedi J- ITX lit     How I must ox course admit that there might becircumstances and times in which we could not only affordbut should be obliged to face a political uproar in orderto attain a sufficiently great end.   But the presence ofthe Simon Commission in India and the very nature of Itsenquiry seem to me to mako it out of the question to bringthe Government of India and the Indian Legislature intodirect conflict with HiB Majesty^ Government and to strainto the utmost the reserve powers which the existing constitution bestows.   The Ticeroy himself has said that hehas no doubt that in aotual fact any increase in thecapitation rate ivhile the Commission^ enquiry is proceedingwould have a very damaging political effect, and it isobvious that if it were made at the dictation of His Majesty7sGovernment the opposition to the Commission as the creatureof His Majestyrs Government would be intensified, and thewhole question of military expenditure would be forced uponthe Commission^ notice in ciroumstances the least conductive to dispassionate examination..  And I must remind my colleagues that whatever we may decide now, and whatever award anarbitrator might give in the meantime, nothing can prevent theCommission, if it thinks fit, from reporting to parliament that the&apos; decision or the award was inequitable and ought tobe annulled.S
         I  submit  therefore  not  only that my predecessors and    o tfj 0    myself  have  not  acted  unconscionably in maintaining our legal    position, but  that,  even if  the  law were not  what  it is,    our  attitude is  the  only possible attitude  in the  political    situation as it  actually exists,  and I Would  earnestly beg    my Colleagues  to  take  a  broad  viow of it and  allow this    difficult question to  go beforo  the  Simon Commission.   But    let  me  make  quite clear  what&apos;I think will happen if it does.    I do not expect  the  Commission to examine the  Capitation Rate    in.detail on its merits  - they have  no qualifications for the    task.   What  I  do expect  them to  do - what indeed we cannot&apos;-    prevent them from doing  - is either  themselves to  lay down some    broad principles for the  allocation of expenditure between    His  Majesty^  Government  and the  Government of India,, or to    recommend&apos; that some  tribunal should be set  up  - whether a Royal    Commission or  a board  of  arbitration - to deal with questions    of the  kind outstanding,  and as  they may arise hereafter.   In -    the  former event I do  not anticipate that it will  be  necessary    to await Parliamentary legislation,  and if  legislation is not    necessary I assume that  the  two  Governments will proceed  at    once  to examine  the  CoiBmission^  principles and by agreement    to apply them  to the Capitation Rate.   Of course,.the Commission    may  also recommend some  curtailment  of the  powers  of  the  Council    of India necessitating legislation.    The Council  of  India is    very unpopular in India  and  its abolition is constantly demanded-.    For  my  own part I think  it performs  highly  impox-tant  and    valuable functions.    But if it be desired, for the purposes    of Great Britain, to abolish its  statutory powers  in  the  next    Government of  India Act,  it  is open  to question whether it  is    expedient in the meantime to force it  now to take  up  a position    in which it will inevitably  appear as  the champion of Indians    interests.
