SECRET..COMMITTEE   OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Persian Gulf Sub-Committee.INTERIM REPORT.                       PART  I. INTRODUCTORY.    THE Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was set up on the 25th June, 1928, by the Prime Minister, at the request of the Cabinet,to examine our policy in the Persian Gulf in the light of the present position.  Onthe 28th June the  Prime Minister, again at the request of the Cabinet, extendedthe Terms of Reference to include certain questions raised in a Memorandum by theSecretary of State&apos;for Air (Paper C.P.-160 (28)) on  the use of Air Power asillustrated by the recent Operations in Arabia.    2.   The Sub-Committee was originally composed as follows :          The Right Hon. Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., Secretary of State            for Foreign Affairs (in the Chair).         The Right Hon. the Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor.         The Right Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P., Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs            and the Colonies.      .   The Right Hon. the Earl of Birkenhead, Secretary of State for  India.         The Right Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., G.B.E.&apos;, C.M.G., M.P., Secretary            of State for Air.         The Right Hon. W. C. Bridgeman, M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty.         The Right Hon.  Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President            of the Board of Trade.         The Right Hon. Viscount Peel, G.B.E., First Commissioner of Works.                Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. P.  A. Hankey, G.C.B.  (Secretary).              -  Lieutenant-Colonel H. L. Ismay, D.S.O. (Assistant Secretary).    During the absence  abroad of Sir  Austen  Chamberlain  in  consequence  ofindisposition, the Lord Chancellor was  asked by the Prime Minister to take  the chair; and Lord Cushendun, the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, wasadded to the Sub-Committee.  The Earl of Birkenhead, after taking an  active partin our inquiry, recently retired from the Sub-Committee on his resignation from theGovernment.                 &apos;    3.   In addition  to the Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services, Field-Marshal  Sir Claud Jacob (Secretary of the Military Department, India  Office&quot;! and officials of the Foreign Office and India Office, who attended as required, we have hadthe advantage of the presence  at our meetings of Sir Robert Clive, K.C.M.G., HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran.    4.   Nearly twenty years have elapsed since  the question of our policy in  thePersian Gulf was  considered by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence under the Chairmanship of the  late Lord Morley.  The ample historical      [18353]                                        &apos;             B 2
and statistical material collected for that Inquiry required to be brought up toj date;and this arduous task has been accomplished by the Foreign Office and India (Office,with the assistance of the Board of Trade, Air Ministry and other Departments.    5.  We have  received by  telegram  very full summaries  of the views of theGovernment of India on many of the questions that came before us.  Sir Denys Bray(Foreign Secretary to the Government of India) is on his way home, having been sent by the Government of  India  for the special purpose of giving us the benefit of his views; and, as soon as he is available, we shall take his  evidence.   For  reasons which are  explained below,  however, it has been  impossible  to await his  arrivalbefore presenting  this Interim Report.    If his evidence  should,  in our opinion,necessitate any alteration in the Cabinefs decision on these matters, we will submit a further report.    6.  On the military aspects  of the question  we  have received  the  greatestassistance from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    7.  The reason which led the  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to  ask theCabinet for this Inquiry at the present time was that, before Sir Robert Clive leftPersia in May to proceed home on  leave, arrangements had  been  made to take up inthe Autumn with the Persian Government questions which by agreement were leftoutstanding when  the negotiations, begun  in February, for a general settlement of matters outstanding between the two Governments were temporarily suspended inMay.   Although the forthcoming negotiations will not be confined to Gulf questions,some of them raise issues which can only be decided as part  of a review of our policyin the Persian Gulf as a whole.   The return of Sir Robert Clive, which could notbe postponed beyond the 30th October in view of his undertaking to start negotia-tions  this  Autumn, rendered it essential that,  before leaving,  he should have some idea of the general  views of His Majesty&apos;s  Government on these  questions, and thathis formal instructions should reach him at latest on his arrival at Tehran.    8.  In these circumstances we have  expedited  our  Inquiry  with a view to the presentation to the  Committee of Imperial  Defence and the Cabinet of this InterimReport, which is confined in the main to those aspects of  the question which bearmore particularly on the  forthcoming  negotiations.       PART II.-BRITISH INTERESTS  IN THE PERSIAN  GULF.    9.  For the better part of a century British supremacy in the Persian Gulf hasbeen regarded as vital to  the security  of India, to hardly a less extent than the integrity of Afghanistan,  and for  similar reasons.  It was a  peaceful supremacywhich made the Gulf an open highway  for the commerce of all nations; and it wasnot challenged until the end of the 19th Century.  On the 5th May,  1903,  LordLansdbwne in  the  House  of Lords made his  well-known  declaration (which was repeated in substance by Sir Edward Grey in 1907) that         &quot; We should regard the establishment of a Naval base or of a fortified port    in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very great menace to British    interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal,&quot;Many  changes have taken place since 1907, when this declaration was last publiclyreaffirmed, and the first question to which we directed our attention was as to whetherthe fundamental problem remains the same.    10.  In  order  to obtain guidance on the military aspects  of  this part of ourinvestigation, we addressed a series of questions to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Com-mittee. In their Report the Chiefs of Staff hold strongly,  from the  military pointof view, that the  maintenance of British supremacy in the Persian Gulf is  evenmore essential to the security of India and to Imperial interests at the present time
than it was in the past.  Formerly, they point out, the Persian Gulf was a cul-de-sac,and our interests there were limited to the security of the western frontier of india from invasion from the west; the protection of our sea routes  to Australasia andthe Far East; and of less importance the maintenance of law and order  in  theGulf in the interests of our trade and of civilisation.    11.  These interests remain, but, in addition, others have come into existence.The  British  Government  has acquired a controlling interest in the South Persiaoil-fields, which  have  been immensely developed, and their importance is enhanced by the fact that oil has taken the place of coal as the fuel of the British Fleet.  &quot; as things now stand,&quot; say the Chiefs of Staff,  &quot; the South Persian oil-fields would, inthe event of complications with America, constitute the only major source of oil supplyunder British control.&quot;  The line of communication to this vitally important supplylies through the Persian Gulf.     12.  The second  new factor to which the Chiefs of Staff draw attention is  theenhanced importance  to us which the Persian Gulf  derives  from the establishmentof Iraq as  a  quasi-independent  State under British  supervision.  This importancehas already been increased by the discovery of oil in Iraq.   The construction of apipeline, if accompanied as seems likely by a railway from Iraq to the Mediter-ranean,  will  add weight  to this  factor by  providing  an alternative  means  ofcommunication to India.     13.  The third new factor is the advent of air-power.  The  establishment of  an organised chain  of air bases is an indispensable condition to the full participation ofour air forces in the  scheme  of  Imperial Defence,  since c&apos; under present conditions the only practicable alignment  for the air route to  the  East and Australia is  viaEgypt, Iraq,  the Persian Gulf and India.&quot;   This third new factor is one to whichwe return later in this report.  (Paragraph 25.)     14.  But if  our interests and commitments in the Persian Gulf are greater than ever, the Chiefs  of Staff hold that they are still  exposed to dangers, though of adifferent kind.  Germany, it  is true, has been eliminated from the problem. But theRussian danger remains in an aggravated form.  The freedom from anxiety formerlyprovided by  the Anglo-Russian Convention  of 1907 has disappeared.  Russia  nolonger needs  our assistance in Europe, and difficulties in  the Gulf &quot;can no longer bedealt with by action at Petrograd.  Russia does not recognise the status quo in  theGulf  or  elsewhere.   Everywhere she is engaged in activities subversive to our interests.  Persia  is so weak in a military sense that no  reliance can be placed  on her to fulfil  the functions of a buffer State, more especially  when  the projectedrailway developments between North Persia and the Gulf are taken into considera-tion.   The development of air power and of the cross-country vehicle increases  thepossibility  of a sudden emergence of a Russian air menace on the Persian shore ofthe Gulf at some future date; the technical difficulties of such an operation are notbeyond the potential resources of Russia, even though the means do not exist in thatcountry  at the present time.  Such a development would  bring Russian aircraftwithin striking distance of the narrow waters  of the Gulf,  where British shipping would offer a vulnerable target. Karachi, the important terminus of Indian strategicrailways, would also be within their radius of action.     15.  The Chiefs of Staff  further comment on the potential dangers to which our interests on  the Arabian side of the Gulf are exposed by the  rise of Ibn Saud  tohegemony over the greater part  of Arabia, and his constant threats to the Sheikhs,with  whom we have Treaty  obligations a matter to which  we shall refer later  inthis Report.     16.  Such,  in summary, are the arguments adduced by the Chiefs  of Staff  tosupport  their view that our interests and commitments  in the Persian Gulf aregreater at the present time than they were in the past, and that the dangers to which those interests are exposed remain, increased rather than otherwise by the advent ofair power.
     17.   The views of the Chiefs of Staff are supported by the Government of Indiawho, as the result of an entirely independent investigation, have also arrived at theconclusion that          &apos;&apos; The maintenance in the sense of supremacy in the Gulf is still essential     to the security of India and Imperial interests.&quot;     18.   In reply to the question of what precisely constitutes British supremacy,and what measures are necessary to maintain it, the Chiefs of Staff have expressedthe following views :          &quot; 19.  The supremacy that we require in the Gulf must be such as to ensure     the integrity of what we hold to be our essential interests.  A number of these     interests have already been examined, and the remainder will be discussed later     in this  Report;  but,  in order to  present  a complete  conspectus,  they  are     summarised  below :          (a)  The security of the western frontier of India, and especially of the port               of Karachi, from attack based on the  Persian Gulf.         (5)  The security of our arterial line of communication with Australia, New               Zealand, and the Par East, from attack based on the Persian Gulf.         (c)  The security of sea  passage through the Gulf itself.         (d)  The establishment and security of our strategic and civil air routes               along the shores of the Gulf.         (e) The security of the South Persian oil  fields and pipeline;  and  freedom               to obtain oil from the port of Abadan without hindrance.         (/)  The maintenance of  the Shatt-al-Arab on a status  that will admit,  in               time of war without violation of international law, its use by the               vessels referred to in the Appendix, paragraph 2, and by aircraft.         (g)  The preservation of our ordinary trade and other interests in the Gulf               regions.         20.  The measures which we&apos; consider necessary to maintain our supremacy,               as defined in the preceding paragraph, are :          (a)  It is as essential  now as  it  was in the days  of  Lord  Lansdowne&apos;s               Declaration to prevent any foreign Power establishing a naval base               or fortified^ port in the Persian Gulf.         (b) We should do all that is diplomatically possible to exclude the establish-               ment  of  foreign  air undertakings within striking  distance of the               Gulf.         (c)  We  must retain sufficient  harbour facilities  for our Navy; and these               must be conveniently situated for the operation of minesweeping and               other vessels that would be required to safeguard the  sea  passage               through the Gulf  in time of war.         (d)  We should press on with all the measures that are necessary to establish               and secure our strategic and civil air routes along the shores of the               Gulf.         (e) On the Arabian littoral we should retain  the  status  quo in  its entirety.               On the Persian littoral we should maintain  the status quo to the               utmost  limit  that  political considerations  will  admit.   These               questions are dealt with in more detail later  in this report.&quot;     19.  On this aspect of the question also, the view of the Government of India isvery similar  to that  of the Chiefs of Staff; and  it is  summed up in their telegramas follows:          &quot; Our supremacy consists specifically in the  exclusion  of a foreign naval     base from the Gulf waters, including the Gulf of Oman, and also,  apparently,     of  a  foreign  military air  base   within   striking  distance  of  them;  the     maintenance on the Arab side of  the status  quo (i.e.,  our Protectorates, our     friendship with Ibn  Saud,  and  our  special relations  with Iraq);  and the     maintenance on  the Persian  side of as much of the status quo as possible, with     unessential privileges liquidated with due dignity.&quot;
    20.  In  view of  the importance of  preventing any  foreign  Power  fromestablishing  a naval  base or  fortified  port in the  Gulf  or air  undertakingswithin  striking  distance  of the  Gulf,  the  question  immediately  arises  as towhat  means we possess for excluding Russia from  these regions.   The Chiefs ofStaff  point  out that this, in the first instance, is a  political problem.  If, inthe last resort, it becomes a military problem, our difficulties are accentuated by theimprovement in communications in Persia, the advent of air power and the develop-ment  of the cross-country vehicle, to which allusion has already been made;  whilethe construction of the projected railway between the Caspian and the Gulf willweight the scales further against us.   The suggestions of the Chiefs of Staff areas follows :-         &quot;With the object of restoring the balance in this matter, we should develop    our own means of rapid communication to Persia, and, if possible, within Persia    itself.  To that end, we  should press on with the development of our  civil air    route down the Gulf; and we should also endeavour to establish air services    into Persia itself.   In addition, the construction of the projected  railway  from    Haifa to Baghdad, in facilitating the despatch of  reinforcements  to South    Persia, would tend still further to readjust the  balance in our favour.&quot;    21.  The political  aspects of this part  of the  question are dealt with by theGovernment of India in the following passage :          &apos;&apos; We can ourselves ensure total exclusion of  Russians from our protectorates    and also  from Iraq.   Ibn Saud  (or  Wahabi fanatics) may be relied, upon to    exclude them  (merchant  shipping possibly excepted)  from Nejd territory.  On    the Persian side,  we must rely,  firstly, on Persian  nationalism  not to admit    Russia  after  edging us  out;  secondly,  on  standing warning of  Lansdowne    Declaration  (reaffirmed   if  necessary);  thirdly,  on  our  own  vigilance  and    determination to reassert ourselves on Persian littoral should  Persia show any    sign of letting Russia encroach.&quot;    22.  Turning now to the position of the Arabian coast in the problem of thePersian Gulf, the whole of the Arabian littoral, with the exception of Nejd, has forsome  years past been virtually a British Protectorate, resting on a series of treaties with  the various Sheikhs, who have been formally promised that     their independence would &quot; continue to be upheld,&quot; and that &quot; the influence of    the British Government  must remain supreme.&quot;These Sheikhs are now threatened by Ibn Saud, and the question arises as to whether,in  the altered circumstances  of the  present day,  the  maintenance  of  their independence is necessary for British purposes.    23.   On this subject, the Chiefs of Staff point out that a Wahabi occupationof the Trucial coast would no more endanger our sea communications than does theirpresent occupation of the Red Sea littoral, but it would operate to our disadvantage in other respects. In order to police the Gulf in time of peace, and to exercise controlof  its waters in time  of war,  we must  have adequate  and  conveniently-situatedharbour  facilities for our Navy.  The possibility of our being compelled to give upthe facilities  which we now  enjoy in  the islands off the Persian coast (referred tolater* in this Report)  increases the importance of retaining our special position onthe Arabian littoral.  In  addition, it is important to retain our privileged position on  the Arabian shore in order  to provide for the establishment and  security ofour strategic air route, which, for political reasons, cannot follow the Persian coast.Finally, our hold on the Arabian ports enables us, if necessary, to bring pressure tobear on Ibn Saud, an object which, without them, could only be achieved by a regular and expensive blockade.  In  these circumstances, the Chiefs of Staff have expressedthe opinion that the maintenance of  the independence&apos; of Koweit and the TrucialChiefs, is necessary for British purposes.    24.   The  Government of India  hold an identical opinion, and extend  it toinclude Muscat and Bahrein.                               * See paragraphs 53-64.
    25.  In examining the part of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff summarised, inthe preceding  paragraphs,  we  were much struck by  the  importance  of  the  Airfactor, in regard to which we received further explanations from the Chief of theAir Staff.  Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Hugh Trenchard has impressed upon us that the Air Force is the most mobile of the three arms provided that the aerodromes and other facilities essential to its employment are to be found in theright place. If aerodromes are not available, and aircraft have to be transported by sea, it is the most immobile arm of the three.  At the present moment the possibilityof developing an organised chain of air bases from the Cape to Cairo and from cairo to Singapore is open to  us, provided we can use areas in  which our position ispredominant.   The Persian Gulf is a vital link in that chain, and its rupture wouldcripple the Air Force in no less a degree than the closing of the Suez Canal wouldcripple the Navy.  The Chief of  the Air Staff developed  in some detail  the risks ofRussian intervention by air in the Gulf.  Aerodromes are already in existence in persia, and are used, for example, by the  German firm of Junkers.  This development is! likely to extend.    Given  the existence  of aerodromes,  an improvement  in the communications by road, such as  is now  taking place, and especially the completionof the railway  from the Caspian Sea to  the Persian Gulf, already begun, by whichthe stores required by aircraft could be  transported, a rapid movement  of  russian aircraft to within striking distance of the shores  of  the  Gulf would  present nodifficulty.   Once within striking distance  of the Gulf, they  would threaten, as already mentioned, the shipping  in the Gulf and Karachi, and, in addition,  the  persian oil-fields and Basrah.  The Indian General Staff have laid the  greatest emphasis onthis menace in  their appreciation of the situation.   &quot; The main danger,&quot; they  say,&quot; lies in the development of an air threat which would have to be met by counter air action .... It is essential that we should be prepared  to  take action  as soonas the danger threatens, and not wait until it materialises, in  view of the ease  andswiftness of hostile air action.&quot;    26.  In  these  circumstances  it  is  essential,  in  the  view  of  the  Chiefof the Air Staff,  that we should not lose time in carrying out our own counter-developments; and we agree in this opinion. Russia, as has often been demonstratedin the past, will not hesitate to violate the neutrality of a weak Persia if the incentiveis sufficiently strong and  the circumstances favourable.  We cannot afford to wait until  the whole of the  material  facilities required by Russia are available.   we ourselves require our own air  routes, and these must be created along both sides ofthe Gulf.   The route along the Persian shore is the shorter and safer of the two.That  is why the Air Ministry have  insisted so strongly on their scheme for a civil air-route along the  Persian coast, notwithstanding the opposition of the  PersianGovernment.   If Russia were to violate Persian neutrality in the  north we shouldbe justified in converting  the civil route into  a strategic route.  The Air Ministry,therefore, urge that we  should not relax our efforts, when the time comes, to obtain an extension  of the period  of three  years  for which  the Persian Government havegranted permission for  the  civil air  route to  function.    27.  But irrespective of the uncertainty regarding the continuance of the civil air route alongv the Persian shore after the three years have expired, it is essential,in the view of the Air Ministry, that we should develop a strategic route,  which,for political reasons, must follow the Arabian shore of the Gulf.  This route has beensurveyed,  and flights have taken place from Iraq, via Koweit, as far as BahreinIsland. No special difficulty is anticipated in obtaining the necessary facilities inKoweit in the north, or Muscat in the south, and none in Baluchistan, on the other side of the Gulf.  The principal obstacle at  present is the opposition of Ibn Saud.Not only does Ibn Saud&apos;s rule extend over the coast of El Hasa, between Koweit andBahrein, where emergency landing-grounds  are required in case of any failure ordefect, but the Trucial Chiefs between Bahrein and Muscat are apprehensive of theinfluence of Ibn Saud.  It is possible, however, that when  better  general relationswith Ibn Saud are restored and the desert  question is settled, he may prove moreaccommodating. The development of aerodromes in Bahrein is affected by considera-tions   to  which  we   shall  refer   when   we  discuss  that  Principality  (see paragraphs 65-68).
    28.  We are advised by Sir Robert  Clive  that  there is no prospect that thePersian Government could at the present time by any means be induced to departfrom their strongly expressed decision that they will not allow the continuance of theair  route   along  the  Persian   shore   of  the   Gulf  after  the  expiration of  the  three   years   which  they  recently   sanctioned.   The   Air  Ministry,however, are not without hope that experience of the working of the  schemeand  of its  value to  them  might  lead  to  an  alteration in  this  view.    On thewhole  we think it would be better not to  raise this question  in  the forthcoming negotiations.  We consider,  however,  that  the  British Minister in Tehran shouldhave instructions to insist on  Persia carrying out  in  the  spirit  her side of thearrangements made with Imperial Airways.  &quot;We also recommend that, in the mean-time, everything possible should be  done, politically, to prepare the way for the air route along the Arabian shore of the Gulf, and, materially, by making the necessary arrangements with the Sheikhs concerned.   In particular, we  recommend that, ifnecessary, they  should be  given some financial consideration,  in  the form  of  acomparatively high purchase-price or rents  for the aerodromes required, and that a start should be made in those districts  where conditions are favourable.    29.  Our  conclusions on the above aspects  of our Terms of Reference  may be summed up as follows :     (a) The maintenance of British supremacy  in the Persian Gulf is, if anything,          more essential to  the security  of India and to Imperial  interests at the          present time than it was in the  past.    (b) Our interests are exposed to dangers not less in degree, though differing In          kind, from  those to which they were liable in the past. Modern develop-          ments, such as air power and cross-country traction, and the probability          of the construction of a railway between Northern Persia  and  the Gulf,          have increased the potential risks to which our interests are exposed.    (c) In order to maintain our supremacy, it is necessary to prevent any  foreign          Power from establishing a naval base or fortified port in the Persian          Gulf, or air undertakings within striking distance of the Gulf.  We must          retain sufficient harbour facilities in the Gulf for our  Navy, and  these          must  be conveniently situated for  the operation of minesweeping and          other vessels required to safeguard  the sea passage through the Gulf in          time of war.  We should press on with the measures required to establish          and secure  our strategic and civil air routes along the shores of the Gulf.          On the Arabian littoral we should retain the status quo in its entirety.          On the Persian littoral  we should maintain the status quo to the utmost          limit that political considerations will admit.    id.)  The air routes referred to above must be developed on both sides of the  Gulf,          namely, the civil air route  along the Persian shore  and the strategic air          route along the Arabian shore.  No immediate initiative, however, should          be taken to try and obtain from  the Persian Government an extension of          the three years&quot;at present granted for the operation of the civil air route;          but Sir Robert Clive should have instructions to insist on Persia carrying          out  in the  spirit their  side of  the  arrangements made  with Imperial        * Airways.  On the Arabian  side of the Gulf every possible effort should be          made by political means  to prepare the way for the development of the air          route. Wherever the conditions are favourable early steps should be taken          to secure the necessary aerodromes and facilities, and, if necessary, financial          consideration should be given to  the Chiefs concerned for this purpose.               PART  III.-POLITICAL  CONSIDERATIONS.    30.  We now have to consider how  far it is possible  to realise the  abovedesiderata, and by what means.                          - .       **-    31.  The situation of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf has been well described as unique;  for although, with slight exceptions, she has at no time enjoyed or evenasked for territorial acquisitions  in those regions, she  has for generations  borneburdens there which no other nation has  ever undertaken anywhere, except in  the       [18353]                                                          c
capacity of Sovereign; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion; she haskept the &quot;peace amongst people who are not her subjects;  has patrolled,  duringupwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship; haskept in foreign ports an open door through which the traders of every nation mighthave as free access to distant markets as her own.    32.  If Great Britain has become in any sense the arbiter and guardian of theGulf, it has not been through a restless ambition to control  the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to the calls that have been made upon her in the past to enforcepeace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, to hold back the arm of themarauder and oppressor and to stand between the slave dealer and the victim.  Noother Power has been in a position to fulfil this role.   Persia, in spite of frequentclaims to the territories surrounding the Gulf, has  never had either the capacity orthe will to make good her claims,  or to  maintain, even on her own coasts, the order and the essentials of navigation which  are the foundation of trade.   Consequentlyto Great Britain, as the Power mainly  interested in the order of these regions, has fallen  the task of suppressing piracy,  the slave traffic, the arms traffic, of main-taining order,  of providing  hghts,  buoys  and other  aids  to  navigation,  cables,telegraphs, wireless services  and so forth.  In  order to carry out  these  services ithas been necessary to maintain some establishments on shore, such as the stocks ofcoal, first at Basidu and later at Ffenjam (where there are also recreational facilities),lighthouses, beacons, wireless stations  and so forth, as well as  to enter into  close relations with the Sheikhs on the coast and islands on the southern side of the Gulf.Everywhere, and consistently throughout the period of our interest in the Gulf, our occupation of  territory  and our exercise of political control  has been kept down tothe minimum essential to the discharge  of the duties enumerated  above.   One resultof our  self-restraint is that,  in spite of a strong moral position, in some cases ourlegal title to the position we occupy is  weak  or  even non-existent.    33.  In the past the  uncertainty  of our legal title has hot  proved of much importance.  Persia has always been so weak  and so distracted by her internal and external difficulties that she could not press her claims very far; while, on the Arabianside of the Gulf, the Sheikhs were only  too glad of our support to secure them  fromthe risk of aggression  by Turkey the only  Continental Power froni which  . theyhad anything to fear.                         The Persian Shore of the Gulf.    34.  The  political position has now changed and greatly to our disadvantage.So far as Persia is concerned, this is due partly to a development of nationalism andpartly to. her membership of the League of Nations.    35.  To what extent the  growth  of Persian  nationalism is likely  to endurecannot at present be judged.  Its immediate cause is the ascendancy of the presentShah of Persia, Reza Khan, who, after removing the previous dynasty, induced theConstituent Assembly, on the 12th December, 1925, to vest in himself and his heirsthe Crown  of Persia.   With the  aid of a  military organisation created out ofthe  Russian-officered  Cossack  Division   in  the   north,  the  Swedish-officeredgendarmerie and  the British-officered and  paid  South  Persia  Rifles,  which inthe  aggregate  constituted a  comparatively well-trained,  armed, equipped andregularly-paid force  of  some 40,000  men, Reza Khan first set himself  to restore the authority of the Central Government throughout Persia and to destroy the semi-independent position enjoyed by many of the chieftains for nearly a century.  Bythe end  of  1925 he had by these  means reasserted the authority of  the  CentralGovernment over the greater part of Persia, excepting Persian Baluchistan.and the tribes of Kurdistan and Luristan.   Since  that time, and in  continuation of  thepolicy followed so  successfully on the  Persian  mainland, the Persian  Governmenthas become more and more aggressive in asserting claims to sovereignty over  the islands in the Gulf and in opposition generally to the British position in the  Gulf.For  example,  they  have referred to the League of Nations a claim to sovereignty over Bahrein, whose  Sheikh is under  British protection; they have revived claims to the islands of Tamb  and Abu Musa-claims which,  though never relinquished^
have until recently not been pressed.  The active assertion of these and other claims by Customs launches, and so forth, has led to a series of incidents which have caused the greatest indignation among the Arab populations of territories and islands under our protection, and  on at least one occasion Persia has only withdrawn under the threat of the use of force.   The frequency of these pinpricks and the wide area over which they extend,  leave no room  for  doubt that  they form part of a consideredpolicy designed with the object of  limiting our influence throughout the  Gulf  andeventual substitution of Persian authority.    36.  Persia is as incapable to-day as at any time in her history of gaining thisobject by force.  She has no navy  at all, and no aptitude for the sea.   Her armypossesses little military value.   She could not assert herself effectively even againstthe Sheikhs on the southern shores of the Gulf, who have sometimes been restrainedby the British representatives with difficulty from taking forcible action to make good their claims to  the islands.  It is not by force of arms that Persia can hope tosupport her claims, but by the new international order that has come into being withthe League of Nations.   Persia has lately been elected to the Council, which has, nodoubt, increased her  confidence.    37.  In  these circumstances, the position of the British Government is one ofgreat delicacy.  The possible courses open to them appear to be as follows :-      (i) To  adopt  the  attitude  that  the  Persian  Gulf  is  a  special interest,           comparable to the  Monroe Doctrine,  which we are not willing to submit           to outside  arbitration or conciliation by  the  League  or to  any other          outsider,  and to maintain our position, if necessary, by force of  arms :     (ii) To allow the  questions at  issue to go before the League, and even to reply           to the Persian claims by referring them  ourselves to the League, trusting           to our historical position,  to the services which we have rendered to           civilisation in consequence of the utter failure  of  Persia to fulfil her          responsibilities:    (iii) To  do our  best to  negotiate a general agreement with Persia by a process           of  give-and-take,   which  will  avoid  any  reference  to  the League          whatsoever.    38.  The first course is one which raises issues of  the highest policy.  No doubtit would-enable us to deal with far greater freedom  with the problems of the persian gulf.  The effects both abroad and  in home politics would certainly be far-reaching.To  discuss these reactions in detail  would, we feel, be beyond our terms of reference,and we refrain from making any recommendation to the Cabinet on the subject; butwe  think the  Cabinet should consider it in all its bearing.    39.  The suggestion in the second alternative, that we should ourselves anticipatePersian action by referring some at any rate of the questions at issue to the Leagueof Nations, possesses some  attractions.  In the last resort, for example, it may befound necessary to refer the Slavery Convention to the League.  Also, in the caseof some of the islands, such as Tamb or Abu Musa, where there is some remote risk that the Persians might take forcible action, it would be possible to anticipate themby referring  the  Persian claims to  the  League.   On the whole, however, we do not recommend this course at the present stage.    40.  There are undoubtedly some of the Persian claims which we should be ableto rebut without  difficulty.  There  are, as already mentioned, others in  which  ourlegal  position is  weak.  There are several in regard  to which we could not countwith any certainty on a decision in our favour.  If we  were to submit to arbitrationsome of the claims on which our position is strong,  it would be impossible to refuseto submit &quot;others  on  which we are on weak ground.   Consequently, it is  better  notto arbitrate at all at  this stage.  Moreover, the Sheikhs on the Arab side of the Gulf,whose protection  is  essential  to our prestige in the  Gulf,  would not  regard  the reference to  the  League  of Nations of questions  which  they  regard as of vitalimportance as an adequate fulfilment of our obligations.    41.  In  these circumstances it appears to us advisable in principle that weshould adopt the third course, and that, while maintaining a firm attitude, we should;       [18353]                                                        c 2
continue our negotiations with the Persian  Goyernment  with a view to a general settlement, to be arrived at, if possible, without reference to the League of Nations,                     The Arabian Shore of the Persian Gulf.    42.  The difficulties of our position on the Persian side of the Gulf have led usto give special consideration to the Arabian  shore.  If our requirements could besecured on this side of the Gulf we could afford (apart from the question of prestige)to hold less firmly to our position on the Persian side.  Here also, however,  thepolitical situation presents disquieting features.    43.  On the Arabian shore of the Gulf our position is governed by  a number of treaties which have been concluded at intervals during the last century and a halfwith the Sheikhs who in the past have exercised control in those regions withoutrelation  to any central authority on  the mainland.   From  Koweit,  at  the westernend of the Gulf, through Bahrein, El Katr, the Trucial Chiefs on the pirate coast,to Muscat, we have a series of Treaties of varying dates which place many of these regions under our protection, although they cannot be described as British Protec-torates.   The generic  term usually employed  to  describe them  is &quot;a  veiledProtectorate.&quot;  In the past the various Sheikhs were glad of these Treaty relations to secure their  position  against  the possible overlordship of  the  Turks.  Now,although Turkey has disappeared from the Gulf, in  addition to the  menace of thePersian pretensions in regard not only to their territories  on the mainland, but alsoin the islands, the Sheikhs are threatened from a new quarter by the rapid rise ofIbn Saud to hegemony over the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula.  The rise ofIbn Saud is a  remarkable phenomenon in the recent history of these regions.  Beforethe War he had won from the Turks the Province of El Hasa, which  stretches fromthe territories of the Sheikh of Koweit down half the  Arabian shores  of  the persian gulf to opposite Bahrein.  One by one Ibn  Saud, by the  course of events or by hisown action, has seen the downfall of his enemies.  The Great War eliminated Turkeyfrom these regions.  His great rival, Ibn Raschid, who had supported the Turks,was then overcome.   King Hussein,  whose claim to be King of the Arabs outragedthe feelings of the Wahabi sect, was driven from his ancestral city of Mecca after theWar and Ibn Saud became the ruler  of the  greater part of  the Arabian Peninsula,with territory extending from El Hasa,  on the Persian Gulf,  to the shores  of theRed Sea.    44.  Up  to the present time Ibn  Saud,  who has throughout  shown himselfconscious of the importance of maintaining reasonably good relations with the power which controls the seas and on whom, therefore, his territory depends for an essential part of its food-supply, has adopted a correct attitude  towards  the Sheikhs andlias recognised that they are  under our protection. Nevertheless, the future is notdevoid of anxiety.  The plan by which Ibn Saud has hitherto pursued his  acquisitionsis largely the method of propaganda.  The Wahabis are a strict Puritanical sectof Moslems,  part of whose creed is  to impose its reforms by  the choice betweenacceptance of its tenets or the sword.   InJ.910  Ibn Saud took advantage of the religious zeal of his people to found a Society known as the  Akhwan (or brotherhood),by which this aspect of the Wahabi tenets was to be promoted.  Every year a largenumber  of propagandists were trained at a special  centre established for  thepurpose, ready to be sent all over Arabia&apos;.  To this system much of the success hithertoachieved by  Ibn Saud is due. The Sheikhs on the Arabian side of the Gulf havenot unnaturally been affected by the appearance of emissaries of the Akhwan within their  territories.  Some  have  themselves  become adherents of the brotherhood.Others are profoundly.perturbed at its effects  upon their subjects.  This is a factor in the situation to which we have to give full weight.    45.  Although no one can foresee whether  Ibn Saud&apos;s success  is due to^hispersonality or whether it is likely to survive his death, we are advised,  and  we acceptthe view, that the Sheikhs on the Arabian  side of the  Gulf are in greater dangerfrom the Arab State which is growing up under Ibn Saud&apos;s leadership on  the main-land than they are from any claims of Persia from across the Gulf.
    46.   We believe that the best way in which the menace of the Wahabis and thedanger of their conquest or absorption of the Sheikhs can be averted is by securingthe friendship of Ibn Saud in so far as may be consistent  with the  protection oflegitimate treaty rights of  the Sheikhs  and with the maintenance of our positionin  Iraq.   In  the Persian Gulf we have  much  to gain  from  the  friendshipof Ibn Saud and  much  to lose from  his hostility.   If our  relations  with himcan be placed on  a favourable footing,  we may hope not only to  secure his good-will in obtaining  the facilities. we require for the air route in El  Hasa, which is directly under his control, but also in the territories of the Sheikhs.  This will take time.   In the meanwhile  it is essential  to  support the  Sheikhs by  an  activedemonstration of our will and power to protect their legitimate rights  in accordancewith our Treaties.  In the forthcoming negotiations with Persia our representative should bear in mind that it is an essential part of our policy to defend the Sheikhson the Arabian shore against the claims of the Persian Government.    47.  As  already mentioned, some expenditure will be required  to complete the strategical air route along the Arabian shore of the Gulf to India, and  some political advantage may  be gained by the adoption of a reasonably generous attitude  in negotiating with  the  Sheikhs  for  the  provision  and  upkeep of the necessaryaerodromes and facilities.    48.  With this preface we can now  examine the detailed questions likely to arise  in the  course of the negotiations,  in order to  ascertain where  we can make concessions and where we must stand firm.  Broadly speaking, however, in view ofthe uncertainties of the future on the Arabian side of the Gulf, it  is necessary forus to  hold on to certain essentials of our position on the Persian side also.              PART  IV.--QUESTIONS  FOR  NEGOTIATION.    49,  It is impossible  to  forecast exactly  what questions will be raised in ageneral negotiation of the kind upon which Sir Robert Clive is about to enter.  It ispractically certain, however,  that, inter alia, Persia will  question  our right tomaintain a coaling station and recreation facilities for the Navy on Henjam  Island,and  our  position  at Basidu.   The Persian claim to Bahrein, though technicallysubmitted to the League of Nations,  is bound  to be brought  into the  negotiations;as also are their claims to Tamb and Abu Musa  islands, which we regard as belongingto one of the Trucial Chiefs.  The question of our rights to the coasting trade is also likely to be raised.                  ..    50.  On most of the above points we shall be in the position of having little to surrender without prejudice to important, and,  in some cases, vital, interests, and, as already indicated, our legal title, as distinct from our moral position,  is often nonetoo strong.  We therefore examined with special care certain other matters in whichit might be possible to make some concession, at any rate from our de facto position,to Persia, with a view to striking a bargain.   The questions investigated from thispoint of view include the  most-favoured-nation clause in the Perpetual Treaty ofPeace and Friendship of 1857; the  possible appointment of a Persian Official atBahrein; certain questions relating to the Shatt-al-Arab, in which, however,  Iraq is primarily concerned;  the  Slavery Convention  of 1882;  lighting and buoying;  ourwireless telegraph stations in the Gulf; the  Duzdab Railway;  and  last, but  not least, the Persian debt to His majesty&apos;s government.     51.  Our conclusions on all these questions will be found  below.  Each of these subjects has a long history of its own.  At the risk of adding to the length  of thisReport we have found it unavoidable  to set forth, though with a minimum of detail,the salient features in each case, in order that the Committee of Imperial defence and the Cabinet may be  in a position to grasp the broad lines of the matters at issue.    52.  If these questions are studied, it will  be found that the concessions we can afford to make are very  restricted.   By far the most important is the possible remis-sion by the British and Indian Governments of the debt incurred by Persia  to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for advances in  money  and kind during the War, to whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer has hitherto felt strong objection, on grounds which
                              Basidu and Henjam.    53.  A stock of fuel and other stores, as well as recreational facilities  for officers and men, are essential to the maintenance in the Persian Gulf of the warships,which show the flag, discharge many important functions, and on which, in the last resort, our position depends.    54.  Formerly the necessary naval facilities were obtained at Basidu, situatedon the westernmost point of  the Island of Kishm on the Persian side of the entrance to the Persian Gulf.   The  British concession in Kishm was obtained in 1820 by a written grant from the Imam of Muscat, in whom effective control of the island was then vested.   The international and legal position of that concession  turns  on whether this grant was made by the Imam as sovereign of  Kishm, and so Basidu,or as  tenant of Kishm from Persia.    55.  The view presented to us by the India  Office  (P.G. 13, page 121) is asfollows :          &apos;&apos; The station cannot be regarded as British territory, and an absolute claim    to the concession, in the face of  a desire on the part of Persia to resume  it,    cannot be maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  On the other hand, His    Majesty&apos;s Government have occupied the concession without protest for over a    century (1822-1928), and, while they cannot be held by mere occupation to have    acquired sovereign rights, undisturbed and unquestioned possession for so long a    period would ordinarily be regarded as giving a very strong prescriptive right    to continue  occupancy on the terms on  which the occupation had hitherto    proceeded.&quot;    56.  In 1912, however, the navalcoaling  station was removed from Basidu toHenjam, and the station at Basidu has for the last few years been retained to asmall extent less because of  its possible value to the Admiralty for coaling purposesthan  for political reasons,  and primarily with the object of using it as a pawn in negotiations with Persia.    57.  Henjam, where the existing stocks of coal  and recreational facilities forthe warships in the Persian Gulf are maintained, is an island 5^ miles long and about 3 miles broad, situated off the south-west coast of the  island of Kishm, fromwhich it is divided by a strait a mile  wide and 6-12 fathoms deep in the  fairway.This  island has been recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government on  several occasions,including  some of  quite recent date, as a Persian possession, in terms such as to preclude a challenge to the Persian claim, based on support  of rival claims made byMuscat.   The position of His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the island turns solely, in law, on the concession granted for a telegraph station in 1868.  That concession interms permitted only the erection and maintenance of certain specified buildings andthe retention of a  specified staff  for telegraph  purposes.    The wireless stationsubsequently erected, the naval coal depot, the naval canteen and recreation grounds,all established since 1912, represent an encroachment of His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentfor which legal justification cannot be pleaded.    58.   The position of His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the island is further com-plicated by the fact that the inhabitants are Arabs, who claim to be Trucial subjects,dispute Persian sovereignty, and tend to look to  us  for protection against Persia.The reaction on British interests on the Trucial coast of the attitude towards them of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  make it  extremely  desirable to take any action.we fully appreciate.  We  hope, however, that when the matter  is considered an indispensable element in the settlement of all outstanding  questions with Persia, and having regard more especially to the great Imperial issues at stake, he may see his way to regard the question in a  different light and to fall in with the views of the other equally interested party,  the Government of India.  We specially invite  the attention  of  the   Cabinet  to our  strong  recommendation  on  this  question (paragraphs 113 and 114 (k) ).
reasonably possible in their interests.  Any such action, at the same time, is viewedwith deep suspicion by  Persia, and represents, from the Persian standpoint,  anadditional argument for  terminating the British connection with the Island.    59.  In view of the  extreme  weakness  of  our legal title to any  possessionwhatsoever in Hen jam, we  have carefully considered whether it would not be possibleto obtain the facilities we require elsewhere.    60.  Basidu is not  regarded by  the Admiralty as in any way a satisfactorysubstitute for Hen jam, whether from the point of view of navigational convenienceor climate.  The extent of the  British concession  is indeterminate, situated on an island  otherwise admitted to be Persian.    61.  Bahrein is too far from the entrance of the Gulf to offer a suitable substitute for Henjam.  It is also objected to owing to the great heat of the climate and the prevalence for eight months of  the year of a wind laden with sand which rendersnavigation difficult.    62.  At first sight it appeared to us feasible to find  the facilities we require onthe Musandim peninsula on the Arabian shore  of  the Gulf, opposite Henjam, andpossessing a number of admirable harbours.  Even the Musandim peninsula, however,which  is within the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Muscat, is not free from  political difficulties, owing to the existing treaties between Prance and Muscat.  But the mainand insuperable objection is the intense heat of the  climate, which compels us to rule out the Musandim  peninsula.    63.  Henjam, with its good anchorage, excellent climate and existing facilities, is so far  superior to any other site from a naval point of view, that, in our  opinion,every effort must be made to  secure the retention there of the facilities we requireand to regularise and legalise our position.  These facilities are  not extensive in character, and we  think it important to avoid the use of such a term as &quot;a naval base,&quot; which does not  properly  describe the position we required.    64.   Our recommendations on this point are as follows:      (a) In the  forthcoming  negotiations every  effort must be made to secure the           retention at Henjam of the facilities we require for the longest possible           period (minimum  25 years) and to regularise and legalise our  position           there;     (6) We can afford to relinquish our prescriptive rights to Basidu provided that           we obtain our desiderata in regard to Henjam.    The question of the wireless telegraph station at Henjam is discussed later inthis report (paragraphs 104 and 105).                                            -                                   Bahrein.    65.   Bahrein  is  an independent Arab  State under the  protection  of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government, but is not a British Protectorate.  Its ruler is precluded byhis engagements from receiving the representatives of, or entering into  relationswith, foreign Powers,  and from-ceding, selling, mortgaging, or giving for occupa-tion, save to His Majesty&apos;s Government, any  part of his territory.   He is bound to suppress the slave trade, and  to prohibit traffic in arms within his territory, and heis precluded from granting a concession for oil or for pearl-fishing, save with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.  From a naval point of view, Bahrein is farless important than Henjam, for reasons  given above in paragraph 61.    It is,:however,  essential to the development of a strategical air route along  the Arabian -shore of the Persian Gulf.    66.   Persia  has for many years asserted claims of  sovereignty for the island,and these have been as constantly repudiated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, downto the  most recent years.  The Persian claims at the moment are in argument,  andhave acquired a  new importance owing to their reference by Persia to the Leagueof Nations. Present indications are that Persia is likely to press her claims, and inthe interests of the Sheikhs, who have appointed His Majesty&apos;s Government theiragents in the matter,  no less than from that of the strategic air  route,  it is very desirable to secure a decision which will finally dispose of them internationally.
    67.  While no concession can possibly be made in regard to Persian claims forsovereignty over Bahrein, we have considered the possibility of going some way tomeet a possible genuine  grievance of Persia&apos;s by  allowing the appointment  of an agent to watch shipments at Bahrein, with a view to  checking smuggling to thePersian coast.  We are informed that in the view of the Belgian officials who control the Persian Customs, the revenue  would be increased by as much as  200,000 a year over and above the present revenue of  1 million  annually, if  smuggling  from the arabian Coast could be  stopped.   Persia is devoting the proceeds  of the Customsrevenues to the construction of the railway between the  Caspian Sea and the Gulf,and is therefore much preoccupied, in this  question.   The Government of  India,however,  have  given  strong  reasons  against  the  adoption  of  this  proposal.They  point out. that recognition of the Persian  accredited agent would have to be forced on the Sheikh of  Bahrein, with bad  reactions  along the Arab littOral; thatit would be dangerous in its local effect, and would lead to requests for Persian repre-sentatives at Kowe.it and elsewhere; that a similar and possibly even  more dangerousclaim by Ibn Saud for an agent could hardly be resisted; and that (unless we declarean out-and-out protectorate) we should weaken our own  position in  Bahrein, whichis  based largely on our admitting no guardianship of foreign  interests other than ourselves.  They think it unlikely that Persia would consider  that her  face wouldbe saved by such an expedient, after making her open claim  to full sovereignty.These are formidable objections.  Nevertheless, we think it possible  that they mightbe faced in return for full and open withdrawal by Persia of her claims to  sovereignty over Bahrein and the withdrawal of her appeal to the  League of Nations, and wehave therefore invited the Secretary of. State for  India to communicate further withthe Government of India on the subject.   Pending  their reply we  refrain  fromexpressing a final opinion on this point.    68.  We recommend, however, that in his forthcoming negotiations Sir RobertClive should be instructed to refuse to treat the Persian claim to Bahrein as open to discussion and to press for its withdrawal from the League of Nations as part of thegeneral settlement.  Pie should bear in mind the great importance of Bahrein fromthe point of view of the air route along the Arabian shore of the Gulf.                Tamb, Little Tamb, A bu  Musa and Sirri Islands.    69.  Tamb, Abu Musaand Sirri are  three small islands lying  well out in thePersian Gulf between the Trucial Arab Coast and the Persian  island of Kishm.    70.  Little Tamb, an uninhabited and waterless island  west of Tamb, wasagreed by the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office in 1908to depend upon Tamb.                                                     M-    71.  Tamb itself is an island 17 miles south of the  south-west  point of KishmIsland.   It is sparsely inhabited  and almost waterless.   It appears probable thatdeposits of red oxide have been found both in it and in Little Tamb.    72.  Abu Musa is a larger and more thickly populated island a few miles nearer to Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, than to Lingan,  in Persia, with good  supplies ofwater and valuable deposits  of red oxide, which have been under exploitation forsome years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of  Shargah.    73.  Sirri,  40 miles from the nearest point on the  Persian  coast, is  moreprosperous and fertile than Tamb, and, like it, contains deposits  of red oxide, though these  are apparently unimportant.    74.  The history and status of these islands  are identical.   While, however, theTrucial Sheikh of Shargah, on the Arab coast, still controls Tamb  and  Abu Musa,on which he flies his flag, His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the Sheikh under protest,have since 1887 tacitly acquiesced in the Persian occupation of  Sirri.  The Persianflag was stated to have been hoisted on Little Tamb in 1901, at the time of a Persianaggression on Tamb  and Abu Musa.  It was presumably removed at the same time as  it was removed  from those islands;  but  the Political Resident reported  inNovember 1908 that the Shargah flag had not been flown on  Little Tamb by the sheikh.  It is not known whether steps have since  been taken to do  this.
       75.   The islands are claimed by the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah as representative   of the Jowasimi Arab Chiefs, one section of whom, in the 18th Century, established   themselves by force or alliance on Lingah and elsewhere in South Persia.  The Persian   claim to the islands has in the past been based on the fact that the  Jowasimi Arab   Sheikhs of Lingah,  under whose administrative control they were  for many years   prior to  1887, had  for long been Persian subjects  governing Lingah  as Persian   officials, and it was suggested that it was in this capacity that they had administered   the islands, which had become Persian territory.  The latest Persian claim, however,   is based on the fact that  the islands  are  shown as Persian in  a War Office map of   1887, of which copies were presented to the Shah by the Minister at Tehran, under   the orders of Lord Salisbury, in July 1888.       76.   In July, 1928, a Persian Customs launch, which had been operating from   Tamb for about  two months, seized  off  the  south of the island of  Tamb an Arab   dhow carrying passengers to the Arab coast, with a small cargo of sugar and dates,   and brought  it to Lingah,, where the cargo  was confiscated as smuggled and the   passeng&apos;ers imprisoned. The incident created a very serious situation on the Trucial   Coast,  the  Trucial  Chiefs  being restrained  only with difficulty from  immediate   reprisals; and  its  possible  reactions proved a  matter of grave  concern to the   Government of India.       77.   Strong diplomatic representations by His Majesty&apos;s Government at Tehran   secured the release of the dhow and its passengers and crew.  The cargo remains   under seizure, and a claim for compensation has been met  by a  reiteration of the   Persian claim to ownership of  Tamb, based, as already stated,  on  a  War Office map   communicated to  the Shah.  The Persian claim  has been  rejected, but it is  clear   that  in  the  forthcoming  negotiations with  Persia not only the  immediate  Tamb   incident but the position of Abu Musa, to&apos; which also a claim has now been preferred   by Persia (and of Sirri) will come up for disposal.       78.   The  effective occupation of  Sirri  by Persia since 1887 and  the  tacit   acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty&apos;s Government make it difficult, if not   impossible, at this stage to dispute the Persian claim, though His Majesty&apos;s Government   ment are not estopped by any formal admission on their part from using the Shargah   claim to the island for bargaining purposes.       79.   From the detailed history of the case which has been submitted to us, of   which the above is only a  bare outline, we have little doubt that the Persian claim to   the islands can be rebutted and that the legal title of the Sheikhs is  the better.  The   satisfactory disposal of the matter is important in view of its immediate reactions   on the  Trucial Coast and the wider  reaction on Mohammedan feeling in India of   disturbance in that region. Its importance from its possible reactions on the relations   of the  Trucial Chiefs with Ibn Saud is  hardly less great.  We consider therefore   that  Sir Robert  Clive should be given instructions  to insist on  the claims of the   Trucial Chiefs to Tamb and Abu Musa.       80.   Although  we think  it improbable  that the Persians will  attempt toI  prejudice this issue by a forcible occupation of these islands, we recommend, in order   to be on the safe side, that the Admiralty should  instruct the naval Commander-in-   Chief that the status quo is to be maintained, and that he is to prevent (in the last   resort by using force) the  occupation by Persia of Tamb and Abu Musa islands.                    British Rights to the Persian Coasting Trade.       81.  Prior to the recent negotiations with Persia which resulted  in the signature   of the  Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th May  last, the Treaty rights of British   ships in Persia were those conferred by Article 4 of the AngloJ?ersian Agreement,   1920, which provided in effect for most-f avoured-nation and national  treatment in all   matters relating to navigation  for the ships of either party in  the territories of. the   other. This arrangement went further than any existing Treaty between this country   and any other foreign Power, in that it applied in full to the coasting trade as well   as to the foreign  trade.  It had, incidentally, the  effect of conferring upon Persian   vessels an absolute  right to engage  in  the coasting trade in this country and   vice versa, and was the only surviving case in which such an absolute Treaty right          [18353]                     &apos;                                   n
and obligation existed.   The general practice which has been followed in. our otherCommercial Treaties has been to exclude the coasting trade  from the scope of the clauses providing for national treatment of ships,  but  to grant,  and to  require,most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of the coasting trade. Accordingly, theresult  of the  Anglo-Persian Agreement, when taken  in conjunction  with  all theother most-favoured-nation Treaties and  arrangements, is  that not only  Persianships,  but ships  of other Powers with  which we have Treaties in force have an absolute right to partake in the coasting  trade of the United Kingdom, even though,as is often the case,  they themselves reserve their own coasting trade to nationalships.     82.  Although we may not have any intention of closing the coasting- trade inthis country to any foreign vessels at the present time,  the Board of Trade considerit desirable that the obligation to allow all foreign ships to participate therein shouldbe got  rid of, as it  is clearly  unreasonable  that we  should remain thus bound by treaty  in a world in which so large a  number  of the principal maritime Powersexclude British ships from this trade.  On the other hand, in Persia itself our ships have enjoyed this facility, and the Board of Trade considered  it desirable to hold onto this, if possible.  Taking both these  considerations into account, an effort  wasmade during the recent negotiations with Persia, which led to the conclusion of theTariff Autonomy  Treaty, to induce the Persian Government to accept a Protocol tothe Treaty to  the effect that existing Treaties should not be  held to confer on thevessels  of either party the right to participate in the coasting trade of the other, butthat British ships were to continue to be allowed to engage in the Persian coastingtrade so long  as Persian vessels were allowed in the coasting trade of the UnitedKingdom. The Persians appear not to have understood this proposal, or at any rate to have  disliked it,  and,  time being  short,  it was  dropped  in favour  of  themaintenance of the status quo&apos;,  which was effected in an exchange of Notes.     83.  The  Board of Trade now propose that in these negotiations we should dowell to be satisfied with the navigation  clauses which are  contained in our usualTreaties, including one which  will have the effect of excepting  the coasting trade from the operation of the clauses providing for national treatment  of ships, whilstsecuring most-favoured-nation rights.     84.  The  Secretary of State for India has invited the views  of  the Governmentof India on this proposal. Subject to India&apos;s concurrence, we  recommend the Boardof Trade&apos;s suggestion for adoption.     85.  We  come now  to  the group of subjects for negotiation, referred to inparagraph 50,  on some of which, at any rate,  it may be possible to make some oonces-sion from our  de  facto position to the Persian claims, and which can, therefore, beregarded as bargaining factors by our representative.The Most-Favoured-Nation Clause in the Perpetual Treaty of Peace  and Friendship                                   of  1857.    86.  After the war  of  1857, there was  concluded  between Great  Britain and persia  a perpetual Treaty  of  Peace and Friendship, which contained a  &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause in our favour.  Sir Robert Clive regards the existence ofthis clause as .a  useful bargaining  factor in the  forthcoming  negotiations.  Thepolicy of the Persian Government is to aim at a short period for their Treaties.  TheTariff Autonomy  Treaty, which was ratified by the Persians on  the 10th May  last,was for a period of  eight years.  The draft of the new  Treaty of Commerce andFriendship, which is to be concluded between ourselves and the Persians, included a clause providing &quot; most-f.avoured-nation  &quot; terms for a period of twenty years.  ThePersian Government will almost certainly object to binding themselves for so long aperiod.  The Treaty that they recently negotiated with Germany was for a period of only five years.  They pressed for  the Tariff Autonomy Treaty with us being for asimilar period. We had set out for ten years and had finally compromised on eight years.  Persia&apos;s attitude in these matters indicates that  she is likely to attach a gooddeal of importance to our surrender of a perpetual &quot;most-favoured  nation&quot; clause.     87.  We consider that it would be worth while to surrender the &quot; most-favoured-nation  &quot; clause in the Perpetual Treaty  of Peace and.Friendship of 1857, provided
that we  obtain  an adequate quid pro quo.  We  recommend,  therefore, that in negotiating the new Treaty of Commerce and Friendship our representative shouldhave authority to relinquish the &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause in the peace treatyof 1857,  and to accept a &quot; most-favoured-nation &apos;&apos;  clause for a limited period of8 years the period proposed for the new commercial Treaty.                     Questions relating to the Shatt-al-Arab.     88.   Sir  Robert Clive has suggested that two concessions might  be  made  to Persia in regard to the Shatt-al-Arab.  The first relates to  the  frontier between Persia and Iraq, which at present is on the left bank of the river, in accordance with the Treaty  of Erzerum of 1847 and reaffirmed  under the Turco-Persian  Frontier Settlement,  to which we were a party, concluded  in 1913-14.   The second relates  to the possible representation of Persia on a Basrah  Port  Trust.     89.  Before setting out these proposals in detail it is necessary to point out that any concession on these points would have to be made not by the British Government but by Iraq.   Regarded as a bargaining factor in the negotiations,  therefore, all we have to offer is our good offices with the Iraq  Government.  Up to the present time Persia has refused officially to recognise Iraq.     90.  Coming to the first of these  questions, the  proposal is that the frontier between Iraq and Persia should be removed from the left bank to the centre, or else to the Thalweg of the stream.  The military aspects of this question were referred by us to the Chiefs of Staff who have summarised the salient features of this somewhat technical problem in the following terms :      (a) At  the present time we enjoy freedom of  navigation  in the Shatt-al-Arab           for vessels of all kinds (including warships and transports), at all times,           whether in peace or war.  If the frontier were altered to mid-stream or to           the centre  of  the Thalweg, our  existing rights might,  in  certain           eventualities, be  prejudiced.   Supposing,  for  example, that we were           engaged in operations in Iraq, and Persia were an unfriendly neutral,           it would, in practice,  be impossible, owing  to the tortuous nature of the           navigable channel, for our warships and transports  to avoid entering the           Persian half of the river.   Persia might raise objections, and, indeed,           would be within her rights  in laying mines in what would be her own           waters.    (b) In view of the possibilities envisaged above, it is essential that our existing           freedom of navigation  should remain unimpaired.   From  a military        ,  point of view, therefore, it is desirable to maintain the status quo.  In           any case the most that we could countenance, without prejudice to  our          vital interests, would be the concession to Persia by Iraq of the portion           of the river  opposite Abadan Town as far as the centre of the &quot; Thalweg.&quot;    (c) There are certain practical considerations to be borne in mind in connection          with any alteration of the frontier to  mid-stream.   Firstly, the Thalweg          does not follow the line of mid-stream, but crosses  from one  side of the          river to the other.  Secondly, there is  the question of dredging.   An          alteration of the frontier in  Persians  favour should be  accompanied by          stipulations as to the upkeep of the Channel.               An alteration of  the frontier  to  the centre of the Thalweg would          create difficulty in establishing the line of the  Thalweg, owing to  the          shifting nature of the banks forming the  bars and shallower  parts of          the river.    (d) It is possible that a solution of  the problem might be found in a Tripartite          Agreement,  between Persia,  Iraq and  Great Britain, under which each          of  the contracting parties  would enjoy freedom, of navigation at  all          times for all their vessels and aircraft.    91.  The  second proposal is for the appointment of a  representative of Persiaon a Basrah Port Trust.  At the present moment no such  body is in existence, thecontrol of Basrah port  and the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab being vested in the IraqGovernment.[18353]
    92.  The matter, perhaps, is of more importance than appears at first sight.The Persian  Government, as already mentioned in  this Report, intends to build  a railway from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.  The natural terminus for this railway is  Mohammerah.   If, however,  the  waters of the  Shatt-al-Arab are  toremain entirely within the territory of Iraq, Persia  is credited with the intention of creating a new  port at Khor Musa, outside the Shatt-al-Arab altogether.    93.  In order to meet the needs of the various  parties, it has been proposed inthe course of our discussions that, in return for the recognition of Iraq by persia and the withdrawal of the Persian claims in regard to Persian subjects in  Iraq, theIraq Government might be  induced to  allow the frontier line to be moved to thecentre of the Thalweg, between Mohammerah, where  Persia already possesses a waterfront, and  Abadan,  and that, simultaneously with this great concession, a Basraport trust  (comparable with the  Danube  Commission), on which both Iraq and persia would be represented, should be set up to regulate and control the traffic inthe Shatt-al-Arab.  The alteration of the frontier and the establishment of this Corn-mission would have to be simultaneous and closely bound up one with the  other.    94.  We recommend that Sir Robert  Clive should be authorised to  bear thisproposal in mind in the  course of his negotiations, although, of course, nothing couldbe done without the concurrence of Iraq.                         The Slavery Convention, 1882.    95.  The  suppression of  the  traffic  in slaves  as  between  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Persia is governed by the Convention between Great Britain and persia of the 2nd  March, 1882.   Under this Convention  the Persian government agreed to take steps for the suppression of the trade and for the search, detentionand  bringing  to trial before the  nearest Persian authorities by His Majesty&apos;s ships of merchant vessels under  the Persian flag or belonging to Persian subjects which may be engaged, or which  there may  be reasonable grounds for suspectingto be or to have been engaged, during the voyage on which they are met in carryingslaves.  There are other detailed provisions, but such is the main purport of theConvention.    96.  The - Persian Government, in April of this year,  indicated in the first stage  of their  general negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government  that  they regarded the Slavery Convention of 1882 as one derogatory to Persian dignity, and while it is to be feared that they intend to press for its abrogation, the question ofthe attitude to be  adopted in face of such  a  demand, if made, has  been under the active consideration of the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government.    97.  The position is complicated by the existence of the League of NationsSlavery Convention of 1926, which  imposes on the States adhering to it a bindingobligation  to  take within their capacity  all possible action to prevent  and to suppress the slave trade and to bring about  progressively and as soon as possible a complete abolition of  slavery in  all its  forms.   Although this Convention was signed by the  Persian representative at the  League, his signature was givenad referendum (and subject  to a specific minor reservation), and the convention has not been ratified by Persia.  Moreover, even were she to ratify in its present form,  she would  be incapable,  as  matters  stand, of  discharging effectively theobligations which  it would impose  upon her, for there is no Persian Navy (otherthan a few Customs preventive boats) and the local  Persian&apos; officials in the Gulfare stated by the Political Resident to be of  such a character that  in the absenceof the Convention of 1882 they would themselves participate in the slave traffic.     98.  The question has been  the subject of much  inter-Departmental investi-gation, and the following conclusions have been  reached  by the  Government ofIndia, the India Office and the Admiralty on the basis of proposals made by theForeign Office :      (a) That  in the forthcoming  negotiations His Majesty&apos;s Government should           aim at  securing that vessels flying the British flag shall retain their           present immunity  from search on the high seas by Persian  vessels
          (which is regarded  as  essential) ; that  no  substantial  relaxation  of          preventive measures shall take place in the Gulf; and that preventive          action in the Gulf  shall so far as possible remain in the hands of His          Majesty&apos;s Government.    (&amp;)  That, in the first  instance, endeavours should be  made to secure  an          agreement with Persia on the  basis of  a modernisation of  the form          while  retaining  the  essential matter of the  1882 Convention, the key-          note  of  the  new Convention  being possibly,  as  suggested by the          Government of  India, that  Persia,  being desirous  of  putting  down          the slave traffic, had  secured the naval  assistance  of  His Majesty&apos;s          Government, instead of,  as at present, that  an unwilling Persia was          being forced to suppress the slave traffic by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    (c)  That the right of searching vessels in Persian territorial waters at present          exercised by His Majesty&apos;s Government under the  Slavery Convention          might be abandoned should some further concession  be necessary.              (Note. Persia already enjoys the right to search British vessels in          Persian territorial waters, and the effect of the concession in  question          would be to leave the policing of Persian waters exclusively to her.   It          may be remarked that in the view of the Government of India even          this gap in the preventive system is beyond Persia&apos;s power to fill.)    (d) That a concession  by which  His Majesty&apos;s Government should abandon          their  right to  search Persian  vessels on the  high seas and should          restrict their search of  such vessels to  Arab waters (in which, under          their treaties  with the various Arab Sheikhs, the right of search  of all          vessels is vested in them), would be in the highest degree objectionable,          as  amounting to  a  virtual abandonment in toto of the Convention of          1882, while the loss of power to search suspected Persian vessels on          the high seas must necessarily curtail the  effectiveness of HisMajesty&apos;s          ships in keeping down the slave traffic.    (e)  That in  view of the present impotence of Persia  to substitute effective          preventive  slavery measures of her own, the  propriety of  invoking          the assistance of  the  League of Nations, in the general interests of          civilisation, should be considered, should  Persia adopt an unreasonable          attitude  and  reject  a compromise on the lines set out in (6) and (c)          above, and that the adoption of this course should equally be considered          in the event  of a unilateral denunciation by Persia of  the Convention          of 1882.*    99.  We recommend that Sir Robert Olive should be guided by the Conclusionsset out in the  preceding  paragraph and should be  instructed to  endeavour tomaintain  the substance of the Slavery Convention of  1882  in the  form  most acceptable to the Persian Government.                             Lighting and Buoying.    100.  For many years before 1909 the lighting and buoying of the persian gulf had been left almost  entirely to  private enterprise, the British India SteamNavigation Company being principally concerned. As a result  of  the Enquiry bythe Committee  of Imperial  Defence in 1908-09, a  Committee of  Enquiry wasappointed and eventually it was decided that the Government  should undertakeresponsibility for the service,  By 1912  a large  programme of reconstruction hadbeen worked out and sanctioned, most of which has  been carried into effect.   The,cost of the service was at first  borne in equal shares by Imperial and  kilatt&amp;revenues, but since 1923 light dues have been levied at Basrah and Abadan by  theport directorate, and the co-operation of British shipping  interests was secured.As the result  of  these   and other  administrative arrangements  considerableeconomies have  been made, and the  fund is in  a comparatively prosperous state.In October 1927 full power was given to the Government of India to manage thefund entirely without reference to His Majesty&apos;s  Government under arrangementsmade with the shipping interests.    * The Admiralty, in expressing their concurrence iu the views of the Secretary of State for India asset out above, added that in their view, if tlie compromises proposed by the India Office were not acceptable,His Majesty&apos;s Government, should give up any idea of making  a Slavery Convention with Persia ; and  thatif there were a unilateral denunciation of the 1882 Convention, Persia, as a member of the League of Nations,should be pressed to take seeps as soon as it is clear that she has failed to suppress the slave traffic.
    101.  It appears that the lighting and buoying of the Gulf has been efficientlycarried  out  since the  assumption  of responsibility by the Government  of India,and it has been almost  entirely to British activity that the larger vessels  using the Gulf (of which the overwhelming majority are British) are indebted for theexisting aids to navigation.   The  Persian  Government have  never  been  ina position to maintain an effective  service and have never played any constructivepart.  Proposals which have been made from time to time for Persian constructionhave been based on the employment of British personnel and British money.    102. &apos;  The Political  Resident in the Gulf has reported that the subject is one in which the Persian authorities have recently shown interest, and that they havespoken to him on the subject of the buoys  at Bushire, and he adds         &quot; The latter  (the  Bushire buoys) might be within the power of control of    the Italian officer who is to be  in charge of their new preventive service launch,    but the main question of lighting and buoying is beyond  their capacity, and    they could probably not pay for, nor would they efficiently keep up, a lightship    such  as that  at  Qais Island.   It is quite certain that we could not willingly    leave  our shipping to be dependent upon the vagaries  of a Persian system of    lighthouses.  The danger would be too great, and the Persian has got to show    greater  capacity for organisation and maintenance  before we  could agree to    such a proposal.&quot;    103.  We agree with  the  Government of India  that the retention by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government of responsibility for the lighting and buoying of the Gulf is indispensable, and we recommend that Sir  Robert Clive should endeavour to main-tain (if the  Persians raise the  question) general British, control of lighting  andbuoying in Persian waters.   We think, however, that he might use the face-savingconcessions recommended by the  Government  of India in the following extractfrom the Viceroy&apos;s telegram 2026 S, the 8th October, 1928, P. 5472 :-        &quot; Present position is, of course, open to attack by Persia from two points    of view.  Firstly,  many lights and buoys which wre maintain lie in limits   . unquestionably Persian, like Bxishire, Jask,  Bundar Abbas, Kishm, Henjam,    Qais.   Secondly, our service is&quot;financed by dues collected from  vessels (other    than  Government vessels and local sailing  craft) entering not only Basrah    but  Abadan,  which  is  Persian territory,  though  anchorage  is technically    Iraqian.       ^                                            -        &quot; It would, therefore, be not  surprising  if  Persia discarded  her passive    attitude of acquiescence for active endeavour to oust us out of all control in    Persian waters.   Yet,  for the  reasons   discussed in  Inter-departmental    Conference in  1923,  we   must  strenuously resist any  interference  with    essentials of  the  status  quo.   We should,  of  course, make every  effort to    satisfy  Persian susceptibilities, e.g., by conceding the flying of  a Persian  flag    on  the Qais lightship ....  Persian upkeep of at any rate  unlit Bushire    buoys, and nominal  Persian control of services in Persian waters elsewhere,    and by admitting Persian representation   (e.g.,  Consul)  on our  Bombay    Advisory Committee,  and perhaps (but this is beyond our  own sphere) on    Basrah Port Trust.  Establishment of direct Persian  management, however,    would be out of the question  at present.    It is wholly beyond her powers    and to admit  it would endanger  shipping  in the  Gulf.   If Persia remains    obdurate, we feel  that she should, in the last resort, be  told that  we must    refer the matter to the League of Nations  as one affecting the  efficiency of a    service  which  Persia&apos;s  impotence  has  forced  us in  the past to  build  up    laboriously and at  great  expense,  and still forces  us to  maintain in the    interests of safety of shipping of all nations.&quot;                     Wireless Stations in the Persian Gulf.    104.  During   the War,  between  1915 and 1917,  wireless  stations  were established  by us in the Gulf at  Bushire, Henjam and Lingah, and no communi-cation regarding them was  made to the Persian  Government.   In April 1922 thePersian Government  asked for their removal.   In October  1927 the  PersianGovernment prohibited the import  into Persia of wireless telegraph or telephone
apparatus, but before the prohibition  became effective a supply of spare parts wasfurnished to each  station sufficient to maintain them, short of accidents, until atleast the middle of 1929.  We are advised that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no legal claim to any of these wireless  stations.  None of these stations is absolutely essential for naval purposes, but they are valuable for the use of  the mercantilemarine.  The minimum requirement is  one station to work in conjunction withthe station at Bahrein and in communication with ships at sea.     105.  Our recommendations are as follows:      (a) That our representative in the forthcoming negotiations should endeavour           to secure the retention of  at  least one wireless station under British           control.     (5) That  it is very desirable that this station  should, if  possible, be on  the           Persian littoral of the Gulf,  and preferably at  Henjam.   It should be           worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department for the remainder           of their concession up to 1945.     (c) If Henjam should prove impracticable, the station  should be at Bushire.*     (d) If  Persia  consents to this arrangement we should make her a present of           two out of the three wireless stations.     (e) If the station on the Persian littoral of the  Gulf should prove absolutely           impracticable, then it should be established on the Arabian littoral.                             The Duzdab Railway.     106.  There is one small matter not strictly speaking connected with  thePersian Gulf, in regard to which it has been suggested that  a small concessionmight  be  made  to  Persia,  namely, the  Duzdab Railway.   This  railway wasconstructed by the Government of India during the war  for military reasons, andwithout  any permission from the  Persian Government, in continuation of  theQuetta-Nushki  Railway through  Dalbandin  across  Baluchistan,  for  a  short distance into Persian  territory.  At  the present  time the  railway  is being runat a loss, and the Government of India, failing agreement with Persia, are preparedto pull it  up. The  railway  is of  some advantage  to Persian trade and to  theCustoms revenue, and  it is  the axis  of  the newly established Persian control ofthe Sarhad, and the proposal has been  made  that the Persians should be made  a present of the 60  miles of railway within Persian territory and should be allowedto continue to use Indian personnel  and rolling-stock on  the  condition that theypay  a  proportion  of  the loss incurred  in the running  of the desert  section inBaluchistan.  Sir  Robert Clive  has informed  us that he  does not attach much importance to this proposal as a bargaining counter, though there may be a mutual advantage in it.     107.  We recommend that Sir Robert Clive should be instructed to press,  whenthe time comes, for a  settlement  on the basis of the Government  of India&apos;s proposal(failing which the  Railway, or the portion on the Indian side of  the Frontier, would naturally be pulled up).  In this  connection we think that it might be helpful tosecure  a satisfactory general settlement if a hint were given to the Persian Govern-ment that, unless they showed an accommodating disposition generally, the railway(which is a source of profit to them, but of loss to the Government of India) might bedismantled (even apart from the contingency of failure to agree upon detailed terms).                   The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.     108.  The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who resides at Bushire, inPersian territory, possesses dual functions.  As Political Resident he  is concernedwith the Arab littoral and islands.  As  Consul-General  for Fars, his connectionis with the  Persian authorities.  The  position is  anomalous.  The  suggestedsolution is that there should be two appointments,  namely, a  Consul-General  forFars, stationed at Bushire, and a Political Resident for the  Persian Gulf, stationedon the Arab  littoral.  There is  something to  be said  for the proposal on  itsadministrative merits, but the matter requires further study, and we propose todeal with it in a later Report.   * The Persians have already a wireless station at Bushire, which niay be  placed in  charge of aFrenchman.  It is, therefore, improbable that a station under British control would  be allowed there.
                              The Persian Debt.   ; 109.  Members  of the2 Committee of Imperial Defence  and of the cabinet who have studied the brief summary of detailed questions discussed in this partof our  Report,  will  no doubt have  reached the same  conclusion as ourselves,that our  representative, from  the point  of view of our legal position, will nothave a  strong hand  to  play in the forthcoming  negotiations at Teheran.  this makes it the more important,  as  indicated earlier in this Report, to give most careful consideration to any substantial concession to Persia which  it is possiblefor him to make.  Almost the only example of such substantial concession is  tobe found in the Persian Debt.    110.  The Debt consists of two parts: the sum of , 490,000, constituting a pre- -war debt on  which  Persia  pays interest,  but for which  no arrangement hasbeen made for redemption, and which we do not recommend should be surrendered ;a series of financial advances and supplies of arms, &amp;c, furnished to Persia duringthe war, the claims for which originally amounted to  over  4,000,000 but whichhas since, as the result of protracted negotiations, been  reduced to  1,510,000.Persia has never actually  repudiated this debt  in terms.   The Persians claim,however, that it was incurred even more in  British interests  than in their own.In these circumstances the existence of that portion of the debt rankles very muchwith the Persian Government and with  the individual Persian.  The Minister atCourt, in  conversation with Sir Robert Clive, has  admitted the Persian liability inthis matter, but has told him that it was quite impossible for him to get theMajliss to ratify it except as part of a  general settlement.    111.  &quot;We do not believe  that in the  long run there is any prospect of ourobtaining the whole of this  money from Persia.  In view of the scaling down of so many war debts, it would be extremely difficult for us to enforce the payment ofthe whole debt,  even if  the circumstances were  more  favourable than they are.We do believe, however,  that the debt should prove a valuable bargaining counterin Sir Robert Clive&apos;s hands.  The Persians, Sir Robert Clive has informed us, feelanxious about the  reaction  of this debt on their  credit.  They are,  as already mentioned, engaged in building a railway between the Caspian  Sea  and the Gulf,and they can finance this undertaking for the first three years  from their own resources.  After that,  however, the  expenditure will become  very heavy, and itmay in all probability be necessary for them to raise a loan.  Sir Robert Clive hastold them that  they could  not hope  to raise the money in the London market if their debt to us had not been paid;  and that if the London  market refused themcredit America  would follow suit.  In those circumstances  it would  be a greatrelief to the Persians to have the debt cancelled.     112.   In the early part of  this year the Secretary of  State for Foreign affairs made representations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking him to waive thisdebt.  Mr.  Churchill replied in February  to the effect that the debt was  a genuineloan to the Persian Government  and that, although the present Government had refused  to pay, there  seemed  a reasonable chance  of  some  future  PersianGovernment being  willing to assume liability.  In those circumstances it was difficult to  sacrifice the sum involved, and still more difficult  to justify the sacrificeto Parliament.   Subsequently, in March  last, Sir Austen  Chamberlain made avery strong appeal  to the  Chancellor, in which  he  pointed  out  that the Indian Government were prepared to take a  much more lenient view of the debt, and to waive their half  share in toto  if necessary.   To that letter the Chancellor  of the Exchequer has not yet replied.     113.   The  Chancellor  of the   Exchequer  was  not  a  member  of  our Sub-Committee, and although  a representative of  the Treasury attended the meeting  at which we  discussed  this subject, he had  no authority to  waive the Treasury opposition.  We wish  to emphasise,  however, what has already been ( indicated/that the remission of the Persian war debt in whole or in part represents by far the  strongest, if not  the only, really big counter in our possession; that the Indian Government have already offered  to waive the whole  of their half share if necessary; and we venture, therefore, subject to the Chancellor of the Exchequers concurrence, to make  a strong recommendation  to  the  Cabinet  that,  as a condition of a complete settlement, and only on  that condition, Sir Robert Clive
should be given authority to include the remission of a part or, in the last resort,of the whole of the debt contracted by Persia during the war, the total amount ofthe debt, as at present sealed down, being  1,510,000, of which one-half  is borneby India.                 PART V.-SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONS.                              BRITISH DESIDERATA.    114. (a) The  maintenance  of  British  supremacy in  the Persian Gulf is, if anything, more essential to the security of India and to Imperial interests at thepresent time than it was in the past.    (6)  Our interests are exposed to dangers not less in degree, though differing in kind,  from those to which they were  liable  in  the past.   Modern developments,such as air power and cross-cOuntry traction, and more particularly the probability of the construction of a  railway between  Northern Persia and  the Gulf, haveincreased the potential risks to which our interests are exposed.    (c)  In order to maintain our supremacy  it is necessary to prevent any foreign power from establishing a naval base or  fortified port  in  the Persian Gulf, or airundertakings within striking distance of the  Gulf.   &quot;We must retain  sufficientharbour  facilities in the  Gulf for our  Navy,  and  these  must be  convenientlysituated for the operation of minesweeping and other vessels required to safeguard the sea passage through the  Gulf in  time of war.   We should press on with themeasures required to establish and secure our strategic and civil air  routes along the shores of the Gulf.   On the Arabian littoral we should retain the status quoin its entirety.   On the Persian littoral we should maintain the status quo to theutmost limit that political considerations will admit.    (d)  It is important to  develop the air routes on both sides of the Gulf, namely,the civil air route along the Persian shore and  the strategic air route along the arabian  shore.   No  immediate initiative, however, should be  taken to try  and obtain from the  Persian Government an extension of the three years at presentgranted for the operation of the civil air route, but he should have instructions to insist on Persia  carrying out in  the spirit their side of the arrangements madewith Imperial Airways.   On the Arabian side of the Gulf every  possible effort should be made by political means to prepare the way  for the development  of theair route.  Wherever the conditions are favourable, early  steps should  be takento secure the  necessary  aerodromes and facilities, and,  if necessary, financialconsideration should be given to the Chiefs concerned for this purpose.                           Political Considerations.    (e) Prom a political point of view the services we have rendered to civilisationand humanity in the Gulf, by the suppression of piracy, the slave trade and the arms  traffic, the  maintenance  of order,  the provision  and upkeep of aids to navigation,  &amp;c, place us in a  strong  moral position. &quot;In  many of  the detailedmatters in dispute between Persia and ourselves, however, our legal title is weak.    (/)  In Persia there has  been a  strong  revival of nationalism under  the stimulus Of  the present Shah, who, after establishing the authority of the CentralGovernment over the greater part of Persia, is now seeking to reduce our positionin the Gulf.  v Though Persia is  incapable of undertaking efficiently the functionswe now fulfil; or of ejecting us by force,  the weakness of our legal status, combined with Persia&apos;s membership of the League of Nations, creates for us  a position ofsome difficulty.    (g) Our wisest&quot; course in the present  circumstances is to avoid reference tothe League of Nations if we can, and to  endeavour  to reach a general settlement with Persia  on the lines of Conclusion (1) below.    (h)  On the Arabian shore of the Gulf our position is governed  by a  series of treaties  placing  under our  protection the  territories of the rulers  of Koweit,Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs, and, for practical purposes, Muscat, the independence of which, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government and  Prance jointly guarantee to respect.  The rise of  the  Wahabi Chief, Ibn  Saud, to hegemony over the greaterpart of the Arabian Peninsula is a disturbing factor in our political relations withthe Chiefs concerned, as well as in the  development of  the southern air route.      [18353]                                                         E
     ii) The best  way in which the menace of the Wahabis and the danger oftheir conquest or  absorption of the Sheikhs can be averted is by securing the friendship of Ibn  Saud.   This will take time.  In the meanwhile it is essential tosupport the Sheikhs by an active demonstration of our will and power to protect their legitimate  rights  in accordance with our  Treaties.  In the forthcoming negotiations with Persia our representative should have instructions that it is anessential  part of our policy to  defend the Sheikhs on  the Arabian shore againstthe claims of the Persian Government.                              Naval Precautions.                    -  .     (/) Although  we  think  it  improbable  that  the Persians will  attempt to prejudice the forthcoming negotiations  by forcible action, we recommend in orderto be on the safe side, that the Admiralty should instruct the Naval Commander -in-Chief that the status  quo is  to  be maintained in the Gulf and that he is toprevent (even by force, in the last  resort) the occupation by Persia of Tamb andAbu Musa Islands.                               The Persian Debt.    (k) The remission of the Persian War Debt of  1,510,000, in whole or in part,represents by far the strongest if not the  only really big counter in  our possessionin the forthcoming negotiations.  The  Government of India have already offered to waive the whole of  their half share  of the debt, if necessary.  Although wehave  had no opportunity of discussing this matter with  the  Chancellor of theExchequer, we venture to make a strong representation to  the Cabinet that, as acondition of a complete settlement, and only on that condition,  Sir Robert  Cliveshould be given authority to include the remission of a part or, in the last resort,of the whole of this debt.  *                          The  Detailed  Negotiations.    (I)  We recommend that Sir Robert Clive&apos;s instructions should be based onthe above general considerations, and, as regards details, on  the following lines    (i)  He should insist on the retention  of our present privileges at Henjam          for the  longest possible period  (minimum 25 years).    (ii) He should refuse to treat the Persian claim to Bahrein as open to discussion,          and should  press for the withdrawal of  the question from  the League          of Nations as part of  the general settlement.  He should bear in mind          the great importance of  Bahrein from the point of view of the air route          along the Arabian shore of the Gulf.   (iii)  He should insist on the  claims of the Trucial Chiefs to Tamb and  Abu          Musa Islands.   (iv)  He should endeavour to maintain the substance of the Slavery Convention          of 1882 in the form most acceptable to the Persian Government.    (v)  He should  be guided by the  conclusions set out in  paragraph 98, and should          endeavour to retain  the wireless station at Henjam  under  British          control, that is to say, to be worked by the Indo-European Telegraph          Department for the remainder of their concession up to  1945.   (vi)  He should  endeavour to maintain, if the Persians raise the question, the          general  British control of lighting and  buoying throughout the Gulf,          but should be at liberty to use  the face-saving concessions recommended          by the Government of India  and printed above in para.   (vii)  He should insist on  Persia carrying out in the  spirit her  side of  the          arrangements made with Imperial Airways of three years,! permission to          fly along the Gulf.  (See also Conclusion (d).)  (viii)  He should suggest to the Persian Government the recognition of  Iraq, in          return for Iraq agreeing to  Persian representation on the Basrah Port          Trust and certain modifications in the frontier along the Shatt-al-Arab.          For this purpose  His Majesty&apos;s  Government would lend  their good          offices with a view to placing  Perso-Iraq relations on a footing which          would lead to the establishment of treaty relations.   (ix)  He should press  for a  settlement  of the  Duzdab  Railway on the  basis          proposed, and bear in  mind  its  importance as  a  factor  in  general          negotiations.          .
 (x) He should offer a settlement of outstanding commercial claims, including        that of the Persian Railway Syndicate, for an inclusive sum of  250,000        to  300,000.            (N.B. Most of these  claims are War claims which the Persian        Government will never  admit.  They total about  1,250,000.   It  is        believed that many claimants have simply written them off.   Sir Robert        Clive believes that if the Persian Government could be induced to pay         250,000 in final settlement of this account this would be satisfactory/) (xi) He should endeavour to get the  Persian Government to embody in the        Commercial  Treaty the safeguards mentioned in letters exchanged on        the 10th May, 1928.*(xii) He should be authorised to offer the following concessions in return for a        satisfactory settlement:             (1) To relinquish the  most-favoured-nation  clause  in  the  Peace                   Treaty of 1857 and to accept a most-favoured-nation clause                   for a  limited period of eight years the period  proposed for                   the new Commercial Treaty.            (2) To relinquish our prescriptive rights to Basidu.            (3) To make Persia a present  of two out of the three wireless                   stations.            (4) Our  goodwill in any negotiations with Iraq for  the rectification-                   tion of the frontier on the Shatt-al-Arab.            (5) The  remission of   1,510,000 War Debt (see Conclusion (k)                   above).                        (Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee),                                                  HAIL SHAM,  Chairman. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,      October 29, 1928.   * NOTE. These matters have not come before the Sub-Committee, but are understood to be acceptable tothe Departments concerned.  They are therefore included in the heads of Sir  Robert Clive&apos;s instructions,although we, as a Sub-Committee, take no responsibility for them.
