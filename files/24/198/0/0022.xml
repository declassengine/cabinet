[ This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1928,SECRET.Copy No,    28CP. 322  1.28.)CABINET.THE PERSIAN GULF.INTERIM REPORT OF  A SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.    IN Section 37 of the above interim Report three possible policies are discussed.The first is that we should adopt the attitude that the Persian Gulf  is a special interest comparable to the Monroe Doctrine,  which we are not willing to submit tooutside arbitration or conciliation by the League or by any outsider, and to maintain our position, if necessary, by force of arms.  This course is not further discussed, butleft for  Cabinet consideration.   I would submit that  it  is  essential that  this consideration  should be given without delay.  We have in  our acceptance of theKellogg Pact  made  a  reservation which we may at  any moment  be compelled  toexplain.   The facts  brought out in the Report show that strategically  our interestin retaining our unchallenged supremacy in the Persian Gulf is hardly less important than our  interest  in the Suez Canal; historically, our claim is much older  andstronger.   If we are forced to explain ourselves, in Parliamentary or in international discussion, and mention the Suez Canal but not the  Persian Gulf, we shall certainlyat once weaken our whole position in the latter region irretrievably.  On the otherhand, so far as American public opinion is concerned,  to mention  both will createno more trouble or suspicion than to mention one.   The whole Middle Eastern area is so much smaller than the area of the Mbnrce Doctrine, and to American eyes veryremote and unimportant.   As far as the League goes,  if we should be obliged  to clarify our position vis-a-vis the Kellogg Pact, it would certainly strengthen us  in refusing to consider the areas in question as outside the orbit of the British Empireand as coming within the scope of the League.  In any case, we are bound to refuse the right of the League to intervene in our relations with Egypt, or our position onthe Suez Canal or  in the Sudan.  If, then, we  are already determined in principle to resist the assertion of the League&apos;s authority in the one area, why should we not also do it in the other, where our historical  claims are even stronger 1  From what Ihave seen of the League I  cannot imagine it doing anything but acquiescing in a firm line taken by us on such an issue, especially if we had taken care to convey ourclear purpose beforehand to the major powers  on the Council.    I hope, therefore, that  the Cabinet will give a general ruling that Sir R. Cliveshould enter upon his negotiations with  the knowledge that we  shall in no casesubmit our position in the Persian Gulf, whether in regard to Bahrein or any otherpoint at issue,  to the League of Nations, and that we may possibly in the  near futurehave to announce definitely, in connexion with the Kellogg Pact, that we regard thePersian Gulf  as an area  where interference with  our supremacy or with  ourestablished rights will be resisted as  a direct act of aggression upon ourselves.Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.L. S. A.Colonial Office, October 29, 1928.[18381]
