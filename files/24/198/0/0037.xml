    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.   28CP. 337  (28).CABINET.REVISION OF THE FINANCIAL AND  MILITARY  AGREEMENTS                             WITH IRAQ.         MEMORANBUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    I CIRCULATE  for the information of my colleagues a copy of telegraphic correspondence with the High Commissioner for Iraq in regard to the attitude whichthe Iraq Government have adopted, towards the revision of  the Financial andMilitary Agreements.    The amendments in the latter agreement suggested by the Iraq Government areincompatible with the maintenance of our present position in  Iraq and with the due  discharge  of  our  international obligations.   They are  indeed  patentlyunacceptable. I have therefore considered it advisable to authorise Sir Henry Dobbsto make a very stiff communication  to King Feisal and his Ministers.    The situation is complicated by the  fact  that the existing  agreements, whichsafeguard the position of the British forces  in  Iraq, will,  I am advised by theLaw Omcers, terminate on the 19th  December next, and  unless before  that  datefresh agreements can be negotiated  with the Iraq  Government or unless that Govern-ment can be induced to maintain the existing agreements in force, we may in thelast resort be compelled to notify the Iraq Government that, notwithstanding theirfailure to accept revised agreements, it is our intention to retain  a garrison in  Iraqin order to enable us to discharge  our international obligations,  and that we must reserve to ourselves the right to regard the provisions of the existing agreements asremaining in force for the present.    I do not think that there  is likely to be serious  trouble in Iraq or that thesituation is likely to get out of hand, but I think it desirable that  the Cabinet shouldbe aware of the  position.  I trust  that once the Iraq  Government realise that thelimit of concession has been reached and that we do not intend to be moved by anythreatened  refusal to  conclude  fresh  agreements, they will bow to  the  inevitable and will negotiate new agreements  in terms which we can accept.   The necessity for making a declaration  of the nature suggested above will not then arise.                                                                    L.  S. A.Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,          November 7, 1928.Paraphrase Telegram from  the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of                            State for the Colonies.                           Dated 16th October, 1928.            (Received Colonial Office 9-27 P.M. 16th October,  1928.)    No. 524.  Important.    Please refer to your telegram No. 370 of the 24th September.  Discussions on financial and Military Agreements have commenced :  committee of three, Nuri, with ministers of Education and Finance representing Iraq, and Air Officer Commandingand myself representing British Government.  The  Premier is away on tour.  Uptill the present Iraq has presented  redraft of  Military Agreement, copy of which      [18429]      &quot;                                *                          ,
will be sent to you by air mail due to reach London on the 29th October.  Amendmentsare radical and contemplate (1) immediate assumption by Iraq of full responsibilityfor security and defence;  (2) consent of Iraq to nature and size of British garrison;(3) complete elimination of High Commissioner and the Air Officer Commandingfrom  inspection  and recommendations regarding efficiency,  disposition and move-ments of  Iraq Army in time of peace;  (4) payment by His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment  of all  British Officers attached to Iraq Army,  number  of whom shallbe in accordance with the request of Iraq;  (5) command of joint  operations tovbeassumed by British Officers only  in the event of British ground forces taking part,i.e., Iraqi to command if Air Force alone shares in joint operations; (6) elimination of consultation with or agreement  of British Government  in regard to strengthof Iraq Army;  (7) exclusion  of non-British Members  of  Iraq Levies from allimmunities with  regard to civil and criminal processes;  (8) exclusion of all Britishfrom  Administration of martial law; (9) omission of all reference to Naval defence;(10) termination  of agreement in 1932.    Paragraph II.   Reason for amendments was explained by Nuri.  He said that public opinion demanded striking advance towards freedom from control, and thatif this could not be obtained it would be better to retain the old Treaty and agreements and to inform  the  people of Iraq that any real relaxation  was refused by GreatBritain.  Iraq Government could not be a party to pretence of advance leaving british control practically unchanged.  So far I have received proposals without comment,merely putting questions to elucidate  full intention of the amendments.  I intend to call the attention of King Feisal and the Premier to earlier intimations made bythem  that if  questions of railways and excess cost of British forces were  arranged,there  would be little difficulty about remaining portions of draft agreements.   but with Nuri in virtual control of the negotiations  I have little hope that  any reasoningwill prevail, and we shall waste time in unending arguments about general principles and responsibility on lines of which His Majesty&apos;s Government had  taste in FeisaFsdiscussions with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London,  and which havebeen revived by. recent vociferous attacks in Parliament and extremist press on wholeBritish Advisor^  system.    Paragraph III.  I  wTould suggest  that His Majesty&apos;s Government in anticipa-tion of receipt of text of proposed amendments and of persistence  in present Iraqattitude, should consider at once course to be adopted.  I can see nothing but eitherdecision to suspend negotiations until arrival of Clayton in the hope  that his freshtouch may be more persuasive than mine, or making of declaration on lines suggestedin, fifth paragraph of your telegram No. 319 of 10th August, 1928.  Against firstcourse is the fact  that I  have been  begged by King Feisal and the Premier to concludediscussions and finish off the whole matter of new  treaty and. agreements before Ileave, as they say that they would regard it as most unfortunate to find themselvesimmediately  in conflict  with the  new High Commissioner at the beginning of  histenure of  office.  I  fear that the second course would cause resignation  of AbdulMussin&apos;s  Ministry,  who  have  shown  themselves  extraordinarily  sensitive  toextremists&apos; criticism, and difficulty might be experienced in getting any other ministry to take office. Abdul Mussin himself has no sympathy with Nurfs attitude, but is too weak to oppose him backed by the King.  I hope that King and Nuri would yieldat last moment if they were convinced that we  intended to see  declaration through,but there  will be much  preliminary  friction, and I  fear that the Premier will, inany event, tender his resignation in order to avoid  whole odium of yielding being-thrown on him by the.King and Nuri.    Paragraph IV.   If declaration were decided on by His  Majesty&apos;s government it would, I presume, include statement that new draft treaty will not be proceeded with,  although conditional promise to  propose  Iraq for membership of the Leagueof Nations in 1932 will remain in force-.  Onr whole position would of  course bejuridically difficult and  facade of treaty, as disguise of mandate, would be practicallytorn down.  I hope, however, that determination to  make declaration, if necessary,might make it  unnecessary.  All  arguments -which;will:naturally occur to you willbe used by me, but I feel that without stick ready they will be without  avail/    Air Officer Commanding concurs in the terms of this telegram.  -
    Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the                        High Commissioner for Iraq.                      (Sent 11-35 P.M. 25th October, 1928.)    No. 423.  Important.    Attitude of Iraq  Government regarding revision of  Financial and MilitaryAgreements: reference, your telegram No. 524 of  16th October.    New demands made  by Government of Iraq are, Of course, wholly unacceptable.  . They  mustthemselves realise this, and it seems possible that Feisal wishes to force the pace inthe absence of the Premier, and in the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government, facedwith a difficult juridical position after December next, will, rather than face seriouscrisis, accept majority of demands, however unpalatable.  Tor this reason he maybe using Nuri as convenient spearhead, whom he could, if  necessary, throw over ifthe pace gets too hot  or His  Majesty&apos;s  Government prove obdurate.    If Feisalwishes to force a crisis,  it is  clearly preferable that it should be  met before the inevitable political  agitation has  time to  gain momentum.    For  this  and  other reasons  which will occur to you, I am clearly of opinion that immediate steps shouldbe taken to deal with situation.    2.  Whatever  may  be real  reasons  underlying attitude adopted by  IraqGovernment, I agree that time has come for His Majesty&apos;s Government to  take up a firm line.   You are therefore  given authority to make to King Feisal and, if you think fit, to negotiating Committee of Iraq Cabinet also communication on following lines (the actual terms being left to your discretion).   This communication may, ifnecessary, be supplemented with such arguments as will  readily  occur  to you to demonstrate the impracticability of individual amendments which Iraq government propose.    3.  You should inform Feisal that you have now communicated to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment new proposals of.  Iraq Government for the amendment of the military agreement.   Those  proposals  and the  intransigent  attitude  on  the part of  theIraq  Government which they reflect  have  created  a most unfortunate impressionupon  His Majesty&apos;s Government.   In the first place, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere assured by both King Feisal and the Premier through yourself that if questionsof excess cost of British forces, railways and port were arranged, the negotiation, ofremaining  clauses of the draft agreements  would present little  difficulty.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government, on the strength of this assurance, agreed  not to press  forthe present proposal in regard to excess cost, and put forward suggestions  regardingrailways and port  of a nature likely to  be  acceptable to the Iraq Government.That  Government has now come  forward with a  number of  wholly unacceptabledemands for additional amendment of the  draft  agreements.  This almost amountsto an act of bad  faith on  the part of the Iraq  Government, in view of  the  aboveassurance by King  Feisal and the Premier, and the fact that when in this  countrylast year the former definitely  accepted articles 1, 4 and 9 in the form in which they appear in  the present draft military agreement.  Moreover,  their  new proposalsshow so complete a disregard of the realities of the situation that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot resist conclusion that King Feisal and his Ministers are sufferingfrom  self-deception on the question of the ability of Iraq  to dispense with british military support.   In their wish not to offend against Iraqi national sentiment, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have hitherto  avoided any action or utterance which wouldunduly emphasise the extent of Iraq&apos;s  dependence  upon this country.   But  thepresent attempt to represent  Iraq as capable of standing alone and as  accepting the instrument which alone stands between  that country and chaos as an act of graceand on sufferance,  is so  wild  a travesty of the real  fact that, with every  wish toconsider Iraqi national sensibilities where possible, His Majesty&apos;s  Government  are quite unable to countenance it.   It must  be as apparent to King Feisal  and  his ministers as it is to His Majesty&apos;s Government  that, the Iraq army in the present stage of its development would be powerless, without the support of the british forces,  to protect Iraq from external aggression or to resist the forces of internaldisintegration.  The ultimate control of the defence forces of Iraq, whether british or Iraqi, must remain in British hands so long as final responsibility for the securityof that country rests with His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Moreover, it is for HisMajesty&apos;s  Government, who have assumed this and other international responsi-bilities in respect of Iraq, and not for  the  Iraq Government, to  decide when  thetime  has come to relax this control, and the  degree of relaxation  which may then
be  practicable.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  nevertheless,  have  always  shown themselves most ready to keep in the background and to work in close consultationwith and through the medium of the Iraq Government, in order that the necessaryexperience might be gained by that  Government  to enable  them  to assume full responsibility for the conduct of the affairs of the nation at the earliest possible date.In this spirit, and under pressure from the Iraq Government, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment agreed to review the terms of the existing agreements with a view to renderingthem more palatable to local sentiment, and the revised drafts recently presented tothe Iraq Government were prepared with this object.   These  drafts  (subject to the amendments  consequent upon recent  concessions in the matter  of excess cost, &amp;c.)represent the furthest limit to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to go.They are of course prepared to discuss points of detail or wording, but they are notprepared to make any further concession on matters of principle.    4.   If the Iraq Government consider themselves unable  to accept these  draftagreements His  Majesty&apos;s  Government will  be quite willing to extend the currency of the existing agreements and continue on  the  basis of those  instruments until thegeneral progress of  Iraq justifies, further relaxation of British control.   The IraqGovernment  may profess  themselves unable  to resist the  popular  demand  for afurther  and striking advance  towards  complete emancipation.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  are  unlikely  to be impressed with such an argument.   The very factthat,  despite Bourdillon&apos;s  letter  No. 361 of the  5th October to the Premier, areport that  their proposal regarding  excess  cost of British  garrison  had been abandoned by His Majesty&apos;s Government found its way into the press and was used as an argument  for demanding further concessions, naturally  causes  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  to doubt the  spontaneity of the -recent  agitation in  the press and todiscount the  force of any such &quot; popular demand.&quot; .  An agitation which seems toowe so much to  official inspiration can, no doubt, be controlled and directed by thesame&quot;agency that called it into being.    5.   If, therefore, the  Iraq  Government  do not desire  to proceed with  the negotiation of new agreements within the  limits defined above, the position must continue to be &quot;regulated by the agreements at present in force;  and if the IraqGovernment show themselves unwilling to  extend the currency of those agreements orchallenge the existence of  the various immunities enjoyed by the  British forces inIraq thereunder and the special position conferred upon the High Commissioner andthe Air Officer Commanding, His Majesty&apos;s Government will, in the last resort, beprepared to make a unilateral declaration on the lines suggested in the paragraph 5of my telegram No. 319 of the 10th August, and to take such action to safeguard theposition  of their  forces and their representatives in Iraq as the situation may seemto demand.    6.  While you are  given authority to make to  Feisal a communication in  theabove sense, you may, should you think it desirable,  defer acting upon this authorityuntil  you have  satisfied yourself that there no longer exist any  other and lessdisagreeable  means  of bringing him and his Ministers to their  senses.  I would suggest that, in the first instance, you should seek an interview with the King  and trywhether  personal representations, supported by all the arguments at your command,will not achieve the desired result.  He might even be given a hint that you have been authorised &quot;to communicate  a message to him from  His Majesty&apos;s  Government of a nature which you are sure would be most  distressing to him and one  which  you are most reluctant to convey  so long as  there is any possibility of inducing the IraqGovernment  by  other means to adopt a  reasonable attitude  in the  matter of  theagreements.  I  would, however, again emphasise importance  of  dealing with  thesituation before political agitation gathers momentum.
