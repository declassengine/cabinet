rnjEIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Pi? HIS&apos;BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT),E C R E 5?..P.345  (28)COPY HO,   CABINET.THE RHODES TRUST.MMIORMDUM BY THE PRESIDENT. BOARD OE EDUCATION.          I  ought, I think,  to  inform my  colleagues  that the    Rhodes  Trustees propose to introduce  a Private  Bill in this    Session altering  the terms of the Rhodes  Trust  in certain    important particulars.   I need  not  go into  details hut  the    most  important object of the Bill will he  to alter the    present method of selecting Rhodes scholars  from the United    States.   At present each State, whatever  its size, has  a    right to two scholars.   It is now proposed  that the country    should  he divided into  larger regions., to. each  of which  a    certain number of scholarships should be allotted.  - The new    proposal has been initiated by the American  Rhodes Scholars    themselves, it has received the  support of the  bulk of the    American Universities,  and Sir Esme  Howard has  advised that  ,    it is not likely to excite any political controversy.          The Rhodes Trustees originally  proposed that the  Bill    should  be brought forward by the Government,  but they were    dissuaded from this course and have  agreed to proceed by    Private Bill.   They would, however,  like  the Government to    indicate to the House,  when the  time comes,  that they hope    the Bill will pass.   It will, of course,  be some time before    the Bill can come up for Second Rsading in  the House but, in    case  members of the House consult me  privately  as to the    probable attitude of the Government,  I should like the    authority of the Cabinet to give it  a blessing  in general    terms.Board, of  Education.                         E.P.   15th November, 1928.
