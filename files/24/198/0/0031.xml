It incorporates the suggestion  bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer that the increase of the borrowing powers should be limited  to two years.     The draft has. been agreed with the Treasury.     As the Bill is urgently needed, I should be glad  tohave authority to introduce it immediately, and, as thetimo is so short, perhaps the Cabinet will dec5.de whetherit is necessary to refer it to the  Home Affairs  Committee.FUNDMemorandum by tho Minister of Labour.RET75ZI (28).         0 copy No..T-.4A.Ministry of Labour.2nd November, 1928.
