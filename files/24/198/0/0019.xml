HJ^JRE......OF i SHEERNES S  I)OuKYAKD ..Po319(S8)              Memorandum by; the  First Lord:  of the Aclmiraltyo[         She Board of..Admiralty are of opinion that She erne ss Dockyard is no longer required for Naval purposes, and they feel it their duty to represent that its reduction to a &quot;Care and Malntenance&apos;&apos;1 status will effect economy in Navy Estimate Sc         Some years ago when it became apparent that there were too many Dockyards the Board endeavoured to dispose of Pembroke and Sheerness.   Attempts were made to lease Sheerness as a going concern for commercial purposes,  but the negotia*- tions fell through-  There is little likelihood of a fresh offer at the present moment *         Further reductions in the amount of Dockyard work led the Admiralty to conclude that they could dispense with a larger Yard than Sheemess under peace conditions, and, in 1925, the Cabinet agreed that both Rosyth and Pembroke should&quot;&quot;be reduced to &quot;Care and Maintenance&apos;^  This  has been done*         Since 1926, the Admiralty have been developing a selx-,.maintenance scheme under which as much of the repaid work of the Fleet as possible is done by the crews of the ships them- selvesa   The system has,  so far as can be &quot;judged at present,^proved successful in the Mediterranean, and has now been extended to the Atlantic Fleet, with a consequent saving in work to be done in the Dockyards.   At the same time, a scheme for laying up reserve destroyers at Rosyth,  under conditions which involve a minimum of dockyard work,  has been successfully Introduced.  As a result,  the Admiralty are  satisfied that the three large Dockyards (Portsmouth, Devonport and Chatham) will/
X \Jbe capable of undertaking  all  the work necessary  in  thiscountry for the maintenance of the  Sleety  and  that Sheernessis no longer required,  in peace time        Sheerness for  some time past has   not  been kept  upto date In its equipment s  and ,  if it is retained  indefinitely;,capital outlay will be necessary to render the Yard  efficient.        She question thus  arisss whether  or not the  Yard shall&quot;be closed at the end of the financial year and the workmendischarged or transferred  eisewliereo        She Admiralty propose  to retain the Naval Storefacilities existing at Sheerness, if the Yard  is  closed,,together with the Medway tugs  and sleet luelling  Craft(though these will be repaired at Chatham) and Sheernesswill remain a mooring centre so long as the mooring  groundis available thereo        All possible steps compatible with economy would,of courses be taken to palliate the inevitable hardshipswhich would result from the closing of the Yardo        The effect on the personnel of the  arrangements described above would be as follows :,-           Present Staff   o...............  2S500           To be retained...............*   60-3           To be discharged .a............   967           To be transferred elsewhere                or retired...............   930        The ultimate saving ax*lsing from the reduction ofthe Yard Is estimated to be approximately   110^000 a yeareIn the first year following the change, various terminalcharges which would have to be paid would  swallow up the savings and possibly leave&apos; a small adverse balance of about 590000        It would be wrong to put this matter&apos; before theCabinet without indicating the serious effect  that the closing of the Yard will have  on the town  of Sheerness.                                                      .Ihe /

(2) the number of xmomployed has considerably         increased (though the increase since 1st         September, 1925., in the number of workmen.         registered as xmemployed at the Exchanges         is 224  only);     (3) the number of jumpers and -the expenditure on         pauperism has increased.J     (4) the rates have increased5 and a larger number         of householders seem to be unable to pay their         rateso        Oil the other- hand, the prognostications that thetown would become derelict and bankrupt have not beenfalxillofic        X feel that I ought to submit the position for cabinet decision., before the Admiralty takes any step inthe matter, -as there are certain consider at ions, whichshould be borne  in mind, besides that of economyo        In the first place the economies carried out by theAdmiralty in the Dockyards sinoe 1924, with the approvalof the  Cabinets  have resulted in a very considerable rodue-tion in numbers  of men employedo   The figures for Tote 8workmen are -

It finds expression through themouths of Dockyard Members, most of whom are supporters ofthe Government, as well as in protest and deputations fromthe workmen and the Dockyard townso        We have already closed Rosyth and Pembroke.  It istrue that at Rosyth comparatively little hardship has beencauaed, but the distress at Pembroke has been really grievous^because it has so far been impossible to get other worksexcept ship-breakers, to establish themselves therec        To maintain Sheerne3s as it is now,  gradually reducingthe numbers as established men drop out by sickness, old age or death, is a possible course,  though there must be some loss in economy, because the overhead charges remain stationary.        To close it now will bo to create a new distressedarea, as there Is little prospect of being able to transferan appreciable number to Chatham--  To do this at the timewhen the Pxrlme Minister is appealing to employers to take                                                    on /
        on workmen from the depressed districts, will no doubt        provoke comment on the action of the Government  as not        being that of a &quot;model employer&quot;q.                If trade were to revive there is always the        possibility of selling Sheerness to some firm or firms        who would continue to employ the inhabitantso  There is        no such chance now&amp;                               .
