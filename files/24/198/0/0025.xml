A brief survey shows that the  &apos; problem of unemployment1lies less in the total volume of unemployment than in itspersistent density in a few industries and areas.   Theeconomic maladjustment, of which this unemployment in the basic industries of coal, iron and steel, shipbui lding andsome textiles, is a symptom, is being slowly corrected, butat the best the existence of a surplus of labour in these industries must be fated, and no such Improvement in tradecan be looked for in the coming months as will have an appreciable effect upon the position.  The urgent problem isthat of dealing with a permanent surplus.    There is, forexample, a surplus of not less than 200,000 workers, in thecoal industry, largely concentrated In South Wales, Durham, -Northumberland, Lanark and Fife.   Apart from maintenance onthe spot in idleness or on relief works, a course whichperpetuates and intensifies the problem, the only method ofdealing with the surplus is by a steady pursuit of the policyof transference.   It is therefore from the point of view      ___^1-_X  The permanent surplus has been variously estimated.  There   are indications that there is a surplus in other basic   industries than coal, and the total ultimate surplus over   peak requirements within a foreseeable period may prove   to be in the neighbourhood of 300,000 rather than 200,000.   These figures are of course exclusive of families  and   dependants.
of facilitating transfers from depressed are&amp;rs  thatrte have considered, a possible programme of works  anddevelopment.   Whatever policy is adopted it must  clearly be a long range policy - the Situation is not  one  which canbe righted in a year.2.   There are attached as appendices to this  Report  anumber of Reports by an inter-departmental sub-committeewhich has studied in detail a variety of works and development schemes.   The possibilities that have emerged, from a survey of the field to date are given in the following  paragraphs.&apos;It will be seen that few substantial works could be put inhand in less than six months and that all require  additionalGovernment finance.   The estimates of the amount  of  expenditurepossible and of employment provided are necessarily provisional.In particular the response on the part of local  authorities may be restricted by the requirement, which it is  essentialshould be imposed on undertaking authorities,  to engage a  high proportion of labour from depressed areas.3.   The works proposed could be put in hand withoutpreliminary legislation.   This  is subject to  qualificationin respect of the Ouse Drainage Scheme (see para.8) and agricultural small holdings  (see pa.ra.ll).   As  to the  OuseDrainage Scheme, the proposal is that it should  be carried outentirely at &apos; Government expense and on this footing legislation is not necessary for carrying out the work.    But  legislation would be necessary, though not immediately, to deal with thequestion of subsequent maintenance, and possibly for  otherincidental purposes.   As regards snail holdings,  there islegislation already in force in England and Wales, governing the creation of holdings.   The scheme outlined  in paragraph 11
oIBSI          would involve action outside this legislation and on the\          Oasis of voted money, and the possibility of Parliamentary          criticism on this score would have to he faced.   Legislation\          to grant authority for the compulsory acquisition of land          among other things would probably be ultimately necessary.          These difficulties as to holdings would not arise in Scotland;          where the Central Authority already possess the necessary          powers to acquire land compuksorily and. to create holdings. Roads&apos;;    4.   A programme of trunk road reconstruction in Englandj(a) Trunk and Wales and Scotland to cost  8,000,000, could be launched RoadJRecon-    at an early date.   The work would last three or four years at struct - ion.      least: substantial works could be started by March, 1929. Appendix i/       For each  1 million spent employment could be provided          directly for one year for about 1,600 unskilled and semi-          skilled men and indirectly for about 480 men on the production          of materials.   At the very least 50$ of the direct labour          employed, which in practice would in many cases amount  to          75$ of the unskilled labour employed, should be from-          a depressed area.   The Exchequer contribution would be 75$          of the cost.   These works would have a high read value. (b) Other 5.   Work could also at the same time be undertaken, Roads.          probably slightly more quickly than on trunk roads, on  the          reconstruction of important secondary roads in rural areaVs.          Such work would be second in importance to truritproad          reconstruction, but would have a high road value.  Estimates          are being prepared of the amount of work which could be put          in hand.               Both these types of road work could be undertaken          outside  the  depressed areas.J
6.     An extensive programme of works of the typoshitherto assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee,e.g. docks, harbours, sewerage and sewage disposal,water works, laying out of parks, recreation grounds and playing fields could be undertaken subject to some relaxation of the condition as to acceleration nowimposed.   To this list civil aerodromes might now beadded.   The difficulties mentioned in the sub-committee7s report (Appendix I, para. 27) in the way ofdifferentiating between depressed and non-depressed areas must be faced.   The undertaking of works indepressed areas should be discouraged and the existingstipulation as to acceleration should be maintained in these areas.   Grants of assistance to authoritiesin non-depressed areas on the new basis  suggested should bo made conditional on the acceptance by theauthorities of a proportion of labour transferred fron adepressed area - at the very least 5GfS Of the labour employed.   It is estimated that works totalling 10 million might he put in hand within twelve monthsoutside the depressed areas.   Actual work would extend over several years according to its nature.    Fewsubstantial works could be started before March next.For  1 million spent on these works direct employmentcould be given to between 2,000 and 3,000 men of allclasses for one year, in addition to a substantial amount of indirect employment.    The Exchequer contribu-tion would vary from 25;.? to 50^ of the cost,  but as theworks would be financed by loan  the burden would bespread over a number of years up to 15.
 Small!h ernes:jpendixIII.   TheUse Scheme,1 9 OJL tj 07.     Schemes of drainage, principally  for reclaimingland (in Essex and elsewhere) recently invaded by  the sea and costing in all  100,000 could be put  in hand by march next on the basis of an Exchequer  grant of 50$.These would provide employment for  about  300 unskilledmen for a year.8.     If the Government were prepared to pay the  whole cost, works totalling  2-g- million could  be undertaken inconnection with tho Ouse Scheme.    These would providedirect employment for 300-400 unskilled men for tenyears.   They would also provide a  very  largo amountof indirect employment.   They could probably be started next spring.pioe  ofEEspgr ammo:fiend ixlIV.9.     We are still examining the position in respect ofland drainage In Scotland.10.    With additional money - approximately  33,000 -the Office of Works could put in hand within a monthworks in the Royal Parks and upon Ancient Monumentswhich would give employment to about 750 unskilled men for about throo months.   These men could be drawnalmost entirely from the depressed areas.   We are examining the possibility of a further extension of theOffice of Ysforks programme.gdpt lament:II Agricul-Iral SmallIjiaings:Ifppendix   V.11.     The works described above would provide fewopenings for married men with families.   The provisionof such outlets is an essential part of any scheme of relief for tbe present situation.       We have therefore examined an experimental schemeof agricultural small holdings to comprise, say, 500holdings.   The cost would probably be about  1,500 per
1 *0 Q6) ForestSidings:holding spread over somo years.   In addition it wouldprobably be necessary to make loans of working capital to the amount of about  500 per holder.   The sohemewould provide for about 3,000 to 4,000 persons.Progress would depend upon the speed with which landcould be acquired and would necessarily be slow.   Wgdraw attention to certain special difficulties inconnection with this soheme in para. 3 above.   Furtherholdings could be formed in Scotland, where these difficulties do net exist.    We are examining thepcssibilities.12.     An increase in the number of holdings to bocreated under the present Forestry programme from400 - 500 to 1,100 in the next three years might bepossible within the present land acquisition programme.About half the total would be available for transferredminers.   This extension might involve an extra expenditure of  200,000, but we are still examining thisquestion.13.     A further increase In the number of holdings&quot;would dopend upon the sums allocated for land acquisition;a larger number of holdings could be provided by anextension of the general Forestry pro.grame for the next ten years from  5-g- million to, say,   8 million.    Forestholdings have a special value as an outlet for families..,inasmuch as they provide a livelihood under conditionsin which the risk of failure is reduced to a minimum.No other outlet  Is so attractive and we are consideringthe desirability of suggesting such  an inorease  of thegrant for the ten-year programme.
    14.     We are considering a variety of other natters,    amongst others the possibility of extending the period    of the subsidy to the Beet Sugar Industry,  telephone    development,  and colonial development,  etc.,  but wo    are not yet in a position to submit any estimates of    expenditure or resulting employment.    15.     We are also considering overseas migration, the    possibilities  of which,  if properly and firmly handled,    are obviously  great.

APPENDIX  I.FIRST INTERIM REPORT OF THE INTER-DEPARTMSNTAL       !       SUB^CCMvlTTSS&apos;:------:-&quot;-Activities within the scope of (A) the Ministry ofTransport, and (3) the Unemployment Grants Committee,1.   In this Report we propose to deal with theactivities within the sphere of the Ministry ofTransport - road and bridge construction andmaintenance, dock and harbour schemes, railwaydevelopment and electrification and electricaldevelopment - and with schemes of work of the classeligible for assistance from the Unemployment GrantsCommittee - works undertaken by local authorities andother statutory bodies.   These include (In additionto some road works and dock and harbour works)sewerage and sewage disposal schemes, electricity,water,  gas and tramway works,  and the construction ofparks and recreation grounds.              A. MINISTRY OF TRANSFORT.El.Roads &amp;I Finance.2.    We are informed by the Ministry of Transportthat the Road Fund for the year 1928-29 is alreadyfully allocated,  and that as a result of the farthergrant to be made  out of-the Road Fund to assist thederating scheme and other prcspective commitments, itis  not anticipated that there will be any surplus ofrevenue in the Fund In the near future to finance an expansion of the  present programme of construction
                                                              -\ii:.a 9*                                                              X V,i M      and maintenancec    Kew  money must  therefore be  found      for any fresh  programme of  road work.      3.    The initiation of  largo schemes  of new road andon:      bridge  construction requires lengthy  preparation,      frequently including legislation,  and on the information      given to us by the Ministry of Transport we think It      Y/ould be useless  to look to new schemes of construction &apos;      for any immediate contribution to the problem.      4.    At the same  time there are certain major works      under the current programme, e.g. the East Lancashire      Road  ( 3,000,000), the Glencoe Road ( 500,000), Thames      bridges, on some  of which work will probably start during      the  coming winter and the spring of 1929, and which will      add generally to  the volume of employment.   The financial      terms under which these works are to be  carried out have      already been settled In most  eases and no new  conditions      as to the  employment of men from  the depressed  areas  could      very well  be Imposed,  but efforts to secure the engagement      of labour  from the  depressed  areas wherever possible  will      be made.in the ordinary course by the  Ministry fcf  Labour.      5.   In addition there are  some  lengths  of  arterial road      In the  West Middlesex  area  which  might be undertaken  at      fairly  short notice if funds  were available.    The Ministry      *f Transport anticipate, however, that  there w&amp;uld be      considerable difficulty in  inducing  the  local  authority to      accept  a requirement that they should  as, a  condition  of      grant  employ  a large proportion  of men from the depressed  areas.
4 $ $JL &apos;ix cJpad Ra-  3true-:.cn:6.     We have come to tho conclusion that if anysubstantial contribution towards unemployment reliefwithin a reasonable time is to bo sought in roadworks, attention must be concentrated upon thereconstruction of existing roads, in continuation of the policy which has previously been pursued.   Thework which could be undertaken may be divided into two categories:  fa) trunk road reconstruction;  fb)(b) reconstruction of roads of secondary importancein rural are as.trunk Roacfecon-struction:                   fa) Trunk Roads.7.     Trunk road reconstruction would have initself a high value In modernising tho rsore importantroutes fsr road traffic;  it 13 more urgently neededthan the construction of roads for new traffic, and itwould probably stabilise and possibly for some yoarsactually reduce the cost of mere maintenance.   Itwould not require preliminary legislation and could beput in hand as quickly as, if not nore quickly than,any other major scheme of work to relieve uneaploymea t.It could be undertaken in areas whore employmentconditions aro relatively good and where there would be some chance of the permanent absorption of men who might be transferred to do the work from the depressed areas.   It would give employment to a relativelylarge volume of unskilled labour and would offer workof a type for which the unemployed workers of theheavy industries could provide very suitable recruits.
8.     The Ministry of Transport prepared for theinformation of the Industrial Transference Board a schedule of some 1,800 miles of road in Englandwhich could usefully to comprised In a trunk roadreconstruction programme ch the lines of the 7,000.000 scheme now nearing completion.Similar schedules are available for Wales and scotland.   The programme Is made up of a largenumber of items of work on roads of exceptionaltraffic importance widely scattered over the counties of England and largely outtside the &quot;badlydepressed are as *   In several cases surveys havebeen prepared by County Councile and negotiationsopened for lend acquisition.   The scheme wouldemploy small bodies of men, distributed in manylocalities.   This would have the advantage of avoiding the need far subsequently discharging alarge number of men suddenly.9.     The actual work under this programme must becarried out by the local authorities (mainly countycouncils).   The readiness of authorities to undor-take the work and to employ a proportion of men fronthe depressed areas would dopend upon the rato of grant from central funds.   At present the rato sf grant paidby th.es Ministry of Transport to authorities to carryout similar work varies from 50?&amp; to 75$ of the cost.The Ministry suggest that a grant of 75$ in respectof works under the programme would be fully justified.Th&amp;y antidipate, however, that in any case some ofthe poorer counties are likely to hesitate before
agreeing- to find thoir-share- of &quot;&quot;the oxp-and-lturgInvolved and that if, as would be essential, a labour-&apos;condition as to the employment of a proportion ofmen from the depressed areas is  imposed, a  stillhigher rats of grant would be demanded-   At the sametime thoy point out:..that to exceed the rate  of 75$,save in exceptional&apos; cases, would lead to unequaltreatment of authorities  (some of whom are  alreadycarrying out work of this kind with a 50$ or 75$grant) and possibly to a situation in which  localauthorities would claim that the whole cost  of improving the trunk roads should fall on central funds.   In view of those conuiderations, we feelthat every effort should be made to adhere  to the75c/o rate of grant though it must be recognised thatsuch a rate will probably restrict the amount of workwhich could be undertaken within a foreseeable periodof time.10.     Work under  the programme requirefa the -prepara-tion of detailed surveys, i.e. the acquisition of  land.(for widening) , agreements with  railway, canal andother interests in  many cases.   Thorc must  bo too afull technical and  administrative examination of everyproposal before a grant could be made, and  the localauthorities take a  good deal of  time in gettingproposals through their various  committees.   In thecircumstances the Ministry  of Transport estimate that,provided the rate of grant  is sufficiently  attractive to secure the co-operation  of tho highway authorities,the m.inimum period which must elapse from the time thescheme might-be sanctdjDnod._b.ef ore any very  substantial volume of work could be put In hand &quot;would be six months.11.     The Minis-try estimate that  1,000,000 spent                                           struction of under .a Beheme of this sort would suffice for the  con- /
                                                            1 fl fiof 70 or 80 miles of road.   On the basis of recent experiencethis would provide employment for about 1,600 unskilled andsemiskilled men on t-he works themselves for one year and forthe equivalent of a further 460 men in producing materials,apart from labour employed In transport and other Indirectwaysc   feut, so far as the 460 men are concerned, It is ptb-bable that in existing conditions the increased demand for&apos;materials would not result In the employment of fresh men,but would simply provide employment for men in quarries andother works producing road materials wHo are now employedonly part time.     If, however, the schemes were specially selected and organised with a view to the absorption of unskilled and semi-skilled labour,  it  is possible that as much as 50% of thetotal expenditure might be distributed in wages  to suchlabour on the works,  so that  1,000,000 expended would providework during 52 weeks  for  a maximum of about 2,000 unskilledand semi-sWilled men.   In order  to  attain  this  figure itwould probably be necessary  to  depart  from  the most economicalmethods of  carrying out the  work,  e.g. by discouraging  theuse of  machinery. lla*  As  regards the actual  amount of  work  which could be undertaken It must  be remembered that  the administrative machinery of the Local Authorities can only undertake fresh work at a restricted rate,  whatever grants  may be offered, and experience has shown that estimates of the  work which could be carried through in a given period are apt  not to be fulfilled. It is considered that few Counties could grapple promptly with a new programme exceeding  250,000  In amount and it Is unlikely that in many cases they would be  prepared to finance their share of the expenditure on any larger scale.   In view of these practical limitations, it is thought that the maximum

The above programme of trunk road reconstruction Islits:          recommended by the Ministry of Transport for prierity among          all  road works if additional money Is to be made available,J(:       dimensions  of any trunk road  reconstruction programme  for         the  whole  of  England,  Wales and Scotland that  could be         launched in the  near future would be  8,000,000*              The execution of the work would extend over  three or         four years  at least and probably more,  and if  the figures of         employment  provided already suggested are used this would give         a total of 12,800 man years (unskilled and semi-skilled) and a         further 3,680 man years (indirectly employed).   These figures         divided by four  would give the average number  estimated to be         employed in any  one year but  there would-in fact  inevitably be.         a wide fluctuation from, year  to year, the peak of employment         being probably attained in the second and third years.              It will be  understood that these figures  and  estimates         are necessarily  to some extent a matter of speculation, and it         might well prove that the work would extend over a longer         period than the   four years assumed.         12.  The Ministry of Transport anticipate  that many local         authorities will object to the importation of labour  from the         depressed  areas  (the objection would probably be least strong          in  the  agricultural areas of the  Southern  and Eastern counties)         The  percentage  of  such  labour to  be engaged would  therefore         have to be a  matter  of  negotiation  with  each  authority;  it          would  depend  to some extent  on the Unemployment  situation in          the  area itself.    We  do  not think  that  the percentage  should          normally be  allowed to  fall  below  50% of  the  total amount of          labour employed,  and  In favourable  cases  an endeavour should          be  made to obtain a higher percentage, up  to  75$.                       (b)   Other Roads.
7a.by reason of the undoubted economic value of the work from the point of view of general highway policy.   Ithas been suggested however that work on the reconstruction of the more important secondary roads In rural areas mightbe put in hand more quickly than the reconstruction *ftrunk roads and that, If money were made available, such work might  (on the basis of experience prior to  1926 when these works were assisted by  the Unemployment GrantsCommittee)  provide employment for  a higher  proportion ofunskilled men.   Such&apos;work  comes second  to  the Trunk RoadReconstruction programme in importance but  has  considerablevalue from  the highway  point  of  view  and in some directionsis urgently required.    In  view  of the  forthcoming changes in  local government under  which the roads in question will be transferred  in  England and Wales fromRural District Councils to  County Councils, Rural Districts might hesitate to Incur new loon obligations until they were sure of their position.   On the other hand, if the Ministry of Transport were in a position to approve special schemes for reconstructing district roads which will shortly become county roads, some Counties at any rate ridght  welcome a new programme on a basis of *Vo% grants from the Road Fund,  since they may otherwise have to incur expenditure on these roads after  the  transfer on less  favourable terms.    Schemes carried out under the conditions  required  to be satisfied by the Ministry of Transport might not employ so high a
jLlwayjit  andIpctri- fcation:volume of -unskilled labour as in the case of works under-taken with Unemployment Grants Committee assistance priarto 1926, but scope could it is thought still be f*und, iffunds were available, for the employment of a substantial volume of unskilled labour on a programme of secondaryroad reconstruction.14.   In the past the Unemployment Grants Committeeassisted a number of authorities to  carry *ut works ofmerely  local value, chiefly street works in areas  *f  urbanauthorities.   These would not normally be assisted outof the  Road Fund unless  they were classified roads and. wedeal with the  possibility of assisting them by  unemployment grants  In para.31 below.15.  The main  line  railway  companies in their present financial position  and with  the tin certainties  of the. &quot;future and  growing read  competition before  them  are unlikely tobe willing  to  embafk on new  capital  expenditure which willnot  be  clearly remunerative,  and  it  is in any case unlikelythat any major new  w-^rks which would absorb  unskilled, labour en embankments,  &amp;c. could be undertaken in time to have any effect  on the  unemployment  situation in the  near future. IS.   The Southern Railway are proceeding with an extensive programme *f electrification.   As regards other railways no other extensive schemes are known to be in prospect.   The largest scheme of this kind which has been discussed - the electrification of the Great Eastern Suburban  lines  - appears to be held up. indefinitely.   It is a scheme also which would require prolonged preparatory work  including legislation.17.   Rapid progress is being made by the Central Electricityjl.  ctrl citygjvelcpment.

The Ministry ofTransport have under-taken to examine this matter inConsultation with the Central Electricity Board,   Anumber of contracts in connection with transmission line shave already been given out;  by cc-operation between theCentral Electricity board and the Ministry  of Labourevery effort is being made to secure the  engagement of  menfrom the depressed areas wherever additional unskilled labour is required.   The demand will  expand with thedevelopment of  the  schemes,  but the total value  ofunskilled&apos; labour  required  Is email.18.  This is  still  at  the  stage  of  technical  ands cientific  investigation.19.  These are  within the  province  of  the Ministry ofTransport,  but  as such assistance  as  might  be  forthcoming for dock and harbour-/ works  would,  we presume,  be provided through the Unemployment  Grants Committee,  we deal with them together with other works assisted by that Committee.   (see paragraph 33 below).    B. WORKS  ASSISTED BY THE UNEMPLOYMBNT GRANTS COMMITTEE. 20.  Since  December,  1925,  grants  towards schemes of&apos;work of public utility put in hand out  of the ordinary course to relieve  unemployment have been assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee only If they satisfied two stringent conditions:-                           -9-
     (a)  That the work was  being accelerated by         at least five years;     (b)  That the unemployment to be rel&amp;eved         was exceptional.   (The 8exceptional&apos;         standard is at present fixed round         about an average figure of 15$).Moreover, since June, 1926, road rork of all kinds hasbeen excluded from the scope of assistance by theCommittee.   Prior to these changes the average annual value of works assisted amounted to  21,000,000;since December, 1925, the annual tctal value of wcrkapproved has been  1,634.,000 in 1926-27 and l,032i000 in 1927-28.   The principal types of worksassisted have been sewerage and sewage disposal and water supply works, urban and rsral road w,-*rks  (priorto 1926), dock construction and laying out of parks,playing  fields and recreation grounds.21.   Under the  interpretation already given to thecondition requiring  exceptional unemployment to existthe  condition has in  come  cases, been regarded assatisfied  if  such unemployment exists in the area fromwhich the  labour (or  most  of it)  is  to be drawn,  andnot  necessarily  in  the  area  in which the wrrk is  to be performed.    In  practice this  interpretation has  been applied  almost entirely to  cases  where the  labour wasto be drawn from a  contiguous  area  with heavy unemploy-ment; that Is to say,  the principle   of  drawing  menfrom distressed  areas,  though consistent with theunemployment  formula,  has  not  been  operated t*  any appreciable extent  nor has  the  possibility  of applying this principle been given  any publicity.                        -10-
i K,9JL p22,   In order to give a fresh stimulus to the Committee^activities and at the same time to assist the generaltransfer policy, it will he necessary (a) to make some changes in the conditions of grant and (b) to adopt apolicy of actively encouraging the formulation andsubmission of schemes.23c   The condition as to exceptional unemployment neednot be altered in terms.   As has been explained inparagraph 21, the condition has already in some casesbeen regarded, as satisfied if such unemployment exists..........in the area from which a proportion of the labour is tobe drawn.   What would be required In order to stimulate the undertaking of work would be a clear imtimation tolocal authorities In the more prosperous areas that theywould be regarded as satisfying this condition If they agreed that a proportion of the labour should be drawn from a &quot;depressed&quot; area.   It would in fact be a positive advantage that the unemployment in the area undertaking the work should be lew.   As in the case of roads the engagement of the maximum amount of labour from a &quot;depressedarea&quot; should be aimed at, and the proporltion shouldnot be normally below b0% of the tttal labour employedIn any case where the unemployment in the area in whichthe work is to be performed is not exceptional.     The condition as to acceleration would certainly have to bo relaxed quite substantially.   Obviouslyit cannot be abolished altogether.   We suggest that
i K&apos;9x 4 &amp;           there should he a return to the position prior to           December,  1925,. and that a grant should be made           available  where it can be shown that the work would           not  otherwise be undertaken within the next two years.Inaacial    24.    We havo considered the question whether theregrins of&apos;5ant:        should be  linked with the relaxations Indicated, above some           Improvement  in the terms on which financial assistance           is to be given in order to induce greater readiness           on the part  of authorities to accept imported labour.           The  present  terms of grant are broadly as follows:-                        (a^  .0n lean Basis.           (i)   Hon-revenue producing works. - 7c--r of the interest           and  sinking  fund charges for half tho period of the loan,           (The present value of this grant is from 40/5 to           of the capital cost of the work according to the longth           of the loan).           (ii) 3svenue producing works - 5Cb: of the interest           charges for  half the period of the loan.    (The present           value of this grant Is about 25^ of the capital cost           of the work).           25.    On tho information before us our view is that           If authorities are not induced to undertake works by the           general relaxations nothing short of a substantial           increase in  the financial assistance granted under the           present terms would suffice.   Any change In the rate           of grant at  this date would be regarded as inequitable           by authorities which have already undertaken assisted           schemes unless the;; too received the additional           assistance.    We think that every effort  should be           made to adhere to the present rate of grant.    At the           same time  the offer of better terms would undoubtedly                              -12 -

Whether  it  would be possible to employ  transferredlabour on such schemes is uncertain,  certainly  no  greatvolume of work on  these lines could be expected, and  we  doubt whether there Is much scope in works  financed on this basis from the point of  view of the present  problem. 27.    The question arises whether the  relaxation of terms (I.e. In regard to acceleration)  should apply generally to all areas, or should be confined to those in which the volume of unemployment is low enough to justify the introduction of transferred  labour.   The latter course is the one which would be required  by a strict adherence to  the policy of transfer, for otherwise the result  would be to  stimulate, at least to some extent, the institution of relief works In the depressed areas and so run directly counter to  the policy.   There would, however, be  real difficulties in so confining the terms,  as there  is  little doubt  that strong pressure would  be  brought  to bear on the Government to grant the  same terms in areas  in
Volume ofresponseAnticipated.BJc  i-/which there is a large volume of unemployment as inrelatively prosperous areas which would be prepared toaccept transferred labour.   At the same time the factthat a number of authorities in these areas are alreadyburdened with commitments In respect of schemes Under-taken in the past would tend to deter some of them fromapplying for further assistance now.   There would alsobe the safeguard in England and Wales that the sanction of the central authority Is usually required to the raising of loans and this would not be given in the caseof authorities whose financial future is precarious.28.   It is Impossible on the data now available to makeany precise forecast of the response which there might balfour the terms above suggested were offered.   The following figures show the volume of work which resulted from thestimulation of applications for assistance in previous years :-                                                July 1923 - June 1924      24,222,000        July 1924 - June 1925      20,639,000        July 1925 - June 1926.     17,566,000It could not, however, be anticipated that schemes tothis value would materialise as a result of any steps taken at the present time.   There are a number of factors which would operate to diminish the extent of the possibleresponse.   First, in many  cases the periods during whichthe  State  has borne a proportion of interest and sinkingfund charges are  coming  to  an end, and the local
authorities are having to find the whole of the interestand sinking fund charges on loans raised some years ago.This is a burden which will be increasingly felt.Secondly, a groat deal of work has been Anticipated1during the last saven years.   Thirdly, a condition thata certain amount of labour must be imported from a depressedarea would no doubt act as a deterrent in some cases.finally, it has to be borne in mind that during the coming winter local authorities will be much preoccupied with theproposed reform of looal government.   As against these factors the grant of the terms suggested above mightbe aspected to encourage the undertaking of works byauthorities in relatively prosperous areas who have fre-tuently In the past not been able to qualify for assist-auce from the Grants Committew.89.   Doubts have bean expressed whether many small scheme in semi-rural areas, lasting, for a few weeks only, forwhich assistance, will undoubtedly be sought, will justifythe transfer of workers from a depressed area.   TheMinistry of labour view is that even if the work lasts for only a short period, as little perhaps, as three or four weeks and is not in an area where there is seriousunemployment transfer is justified.   We accept this view.We feel, however, that the Ministry of Labour may be pressed to undertake some responsibility for transferredworkers whan the work for which they ware imported isfinished.30.   The impressions obtained by the unemployment grants Committee from dopu.ations and correspondence indie&quot;ate that many local authorities have, schemes of workfor the improvement of their localities which they would consider undertaking if assistance from the Grants
Committee were available on the terms Indicated above.During the past two years schemes to the value of over 5 million have been rejected by the Unemployment GrantsCommittee or withdrawn by local authorities owing largely to the more stringent conditions imposed.   These schemes were scattered widely *Ver the country and Included manyin areas of high value tcday from the point of view of thetransfer policy.   They embraced a wide variety of localutility such as sewerage and drainage works, electricalwork, road work In towns, gas and water works.   It Isknown too that a number of local authorities in rural areas are anxious to Instal sewerage and water schemes and cannot afford to do so without assistance.   In such areasunemployment is generally low and there Is an actualobjection to the use of local labour inasmuch as it maydivert labour from necessary local work, e.g. agriculture.a condition favourable to the use of a high proportionof imported labour.31,   As indicated In paragraph 14 above,  street works inBoroughs, Urban Districts and Burghs (widening, re con-struct I on, resurfacing, surface water sewers and. even newroads) would not ordinarily be assisted by the Ministry ofTransport, save in the case of classified reads, owing tothe fact that the traffic value of such roads is slight.This work could, however, be assisted by the unemployment grants Committee (as formerly on a considerable scale),and though of less national value, might in some cases be started rather more rapidly than the trunk road schemes.It would alsr, probably employ a greater proportion ofunskilled labour, and would involve less expendittrre onmaterials, machinery and plant.

We shall  deal with this matter  in  a              later report.ppeks and           Daring the last few years dock and harbour arbours.              authorities have carried out an exceptionally  large              number of schemes with the  assistance  of  Trade Facilities              loans ana assistance from the Unemployment Grants              Committee.  Most of these are now finished or  approaching              completion.   In the Port of London some  important              works are in progress and a very large scheme  (to cost               11 million) has just been  initiated (without  State              assistance) by the Southern Railway at Southampton.              Dock construction schemes in general require prslanged              preparatory work and the Ministry of Transport are not              aware of any large scale schemes of this  nature liiely              to be undertaken which have reached such  a state  of              maturity that large works could be put in hand within              the next year.   These works, however, where carried              out by local authorities or statutory bodies are              eligible for a grant from the Unemployment Grants              Committee under certain conditions.  (The present value              of the grant is about 25fc of the capital  cost  of  the              work).  If a fresh stimulus is given to this scheme              some new schemes of work might be forthcoming  within              the next six months.   Two  schemes which  might come              into this category in the Port of London  and Aberdeen,              estimated to cost  250,000  and  300,000 respectively              are known to the Unemployment Grants Committee.              Farther, the Ministry of Transport believe that a              oerbain number of port authorities might  undertakeS1                                    IV.
the -modernisation&apos; of thoir -quay and wharf-equipment.This would be work of real economic value but its contribution to the present unemployment situation would be mainly by way of providing more employment for the equipment manufacturing industries, e.g.,iron and steel, engineering.   It would not directlyassist the transfer policy. (Reference may be made tothe question of constructing a new fish dock atGrinsby, but for this new Parliamentary powers wpuldbe required).     34.  So far as the Board of Education are ooncerned,the only schemes which seem eligible f )r grants fromthe Unemployment Grants Committee are schemes ff workwhich is not work which the Board can Insist on theAuthorities carrying out immediately.&apos;   The offer of u.G.C. grants might stimulate a certain amount of work(on which unemployed could be engaged) on such matters as the levelling of playing fields, the repair of the surface of playgrounds, the preparation of sites, thepainting of schools, the work in each case being workwhich the Board could not have required the Authority tocarry out.  From the board previous expordence,however, it is probable that the number of schemes ofthis nature likely to be put forward will be extremelysmall.      35.  Seme few schemes, but those not of any magnitude, among the schemes previously rejected might bo put into operation by the end of 19S8,  but we are advised that, in view of the preliminary werk involved, including decisions by undertaking authorities on schemes, preparations of plans, subsequent con- sideration and obtaining tenders, the earliest date

Owing to the form taken by the Unemployment employ -I provided.   Grants Committee grants the burden on the State  is             spread over a period of years up to 15 and the immediate             effect of an increased programme is therefrre relatively             slight.  Schemes so far approved for grant by the             Committee amount in value to just over  99,OO0,u0O on             which the State liability is  42,786,000, spread, as             already pointed out, over a period of 15 years.   from             the date at. their disposal the Unemployment Grants             Committee have calculated that in the execution of these             works (practically all of which are of public and             permanent value) for each  1,000,000 of cost,, direct             employment has been pr-)vided for some 3,000 men for a             year, and about the same amount in indirect employment,             i.e., the preparation of materials in workshops,             factories and quarries, transport, etc.                  37.  It will be noteo that the amount of employment             provided for  1 million - 3,000 men for a year - is             considerably higher than that which it Is estimated             would be provided by trunk road reconstruction schemes.             The Unemployment Grants Committee figures are, however,             based on estimates supplied before the work is started             by the undertaking authorities;  and Ministry of             Transport figures are conservative estimates based on             recent experience.   Moreover,  the Unemployment Grants             Committee figures cover all types of labour, Including             skilled and supervisory labour.  The Ministry of             Transport figures Include unskilled and semi skilled             labour only. . Again, most of the schemes assisted by             the Unemployment Grants Committee have been such as
LSIX              would  employ  the  maximum amount  of unskilled manual              labour,  e.g. ,  trenoh digging for. sewers,  excavation              of  docks,  levelling of ground for parks and recreation              grounds.    The  road works assisted have been carried              out for  the most  part under conditions of small scale              contracting,  i.e. ,  they have been carried out with a              large  application of manual labour.    The trunk road              reconstruction  Gohemes would for the  most part be              carried  out under conditions of  lafge scale contracting,              i.e.,  with the  maximum use of mechanical  appliances.              ^he Ministry  of Transport advise moreover, that, in              order  to  obtain the maximum road value for the money              spent,  similar  methods would have to  be more largely .              applied  to rural  road reconstruction  schemes if these              were to  be undertaken than in the past.   This would              lead to  a  reduction in the ratio of  employment              provided  to money spent.jme of              38.    As in  the case of roads,  the proportion offljoyrnentBided for      labour from the depressed areas  to be engaged on schemespur fromjessed        undertaken in non-depressed ireas would have to be aIs&quot;.              matter for negotiation with the  authority concerned.

In conclusion we wish to draw special attentionllfeiate         to the action which it would be necessary to start atjfcjck.          once in order that appreciable results might be looked              for by March, 1929.   Such action would include:-              (a)  The issue by the &quot;unemployment Grants Committee                   of a circular letter to I*.cal authorities setting                   out the new proposals and asking for schemes                   to be submitted.                               -20-

(Note::   The position in Scotland will ho dealt with            in a subsequent report).        1.    Notes  by the  Ministry of Agriculture are attached on        (A)  land drainage  and land reclamation;  (B.) the sugar beet        Industry;  (C) rural handicrafts.nd      2.    The recent history of land drainage schemes in Englandspin age :        and  Wales is set out in the attached note by the Ministry of        Agriculture.   It  is clear that there is a large amount of        urgent  drainage work which if carried out would be of real        economic value to  the country.   The obstacles in the way        of carrying out these works are mainly financial, but there        is also an absence of comprehensive authorities.        3.   Land drainage schemes undertaken by statutory drainage        authorities and otherwise have been recognised since the war        as proper subjects&apos;for State assistance, but as will be seen        from the note the Exchequer money made available since 1926        for assisting such schemes has (after allowing for future        commitments in  connection with the Ouse estuary scheme) been        almost entirely allocated.   Apart from this drainage        authorities themselves are, in many cases, so  impoverished        through  inability to collect rates that even if further State        grants were made available they would probably net be able to                                  -1-
find their share of the cost of any further schemes.   Finallyin a number of areas whore large schemes are now required,particularly In river estuaries, there are no drainageauthorities competent to undertake the work.4.   The position of land drainage and the present law includingthe powers and duties of drainage authorities were considered indetail by the Royal Commission on Land Drainage which reportedin 1927.   The Cemmission recommended a wholesale revision ef thelaw and the formation of larger drainage authorities, with pewerover the  vtiole ca.tch.ment area of the river.   These authorities,by reason of a more extensive rateable area, would be in  a stronger financial position than existing drainage authoritiesand would therefore be better placed to undertake comprehensiveschemes of the kind now urgently required.   Drastic  legislation would, however, be necessary in the first instance and  thenecessary preliminaries  (surveys) are nc*w being  carried, out.5.   In the absence cf the  larger drainage authorities, theMinistry  of Agriculture take the view that the number of  schemesof  land drainage which could in present circumstances be  under-taken  if  further State grants were made available is  limited.There  are, however, a  certain number  of schemes,  e.g, In  areasflooded by the high tides  last winter in Essex and  on the WestCcast, which drainage authorities might be prepared to undertakeby  say February or  March,  although the  imposition e-f.  a  condition that a certain proportion  a  the labour must be  taken fr-m thedepressed areas would nn doubt act as a deterrent.    It isdifficult to estimate what  the  cost of these schemes  would be or what volume of  employment  they would  afford, but Wt*rk costing about   100,000 might be  organised by  the abeve dates, providedthat the  Government grant  is not below 50^.6.   A3 regards land drainage schemes generally, It may beassumed that the larger  the work to be undertaken,  the less the                                -2-
proportion of unskilled labour employed, owing to the necessityof making the utmost use possible of mechanical appliances.   Acertain proportion of unskilled labour  is, however, normallyrequired in connection with embankments and  for this work  labour from the heavy industries would be suitable.   The proportionof such labour would have to be a matter  for negotiation withthe undertaking authority.7.   In the view of the Ministry of Agriculture,  such  schemesas might be forthcoming if  further State  grants were made  avail-able would merely  toixefc the fringe of  the work urgently necessary from the national  point *f  view  in the sphere of  land  drainage.There  is, however, no  likelihood that  really comprehensiveschemes will  be  forthcoming for  the reasons  stated in  para. 3abpve,  and we have come to  the conclusion that if it were  desiredto  initiate  large  drainage  schemes  of  national utility at  once,it would be necessary  for the  State tr bear  the  entire cost.      *Under  such  conditions  there is certainly **ne large scheme  vhichcould  be  started at  a  fairly  early- date,  i.e. the Cuse estuaryand main  river  scheme  at  a  cost  of   2-g- millions.    No  dpubt some preliminary wcrk could be  put  in hand  by the New Year.   Thewhole.-scheme  would take at  least .12 years.   It  may be mentioned that  the  Royal  Commission anticipated  that in the case of someworks  of  this nature- the  State would have to bear some of the cost,  even after-the&quot;re-organisation  of drainage authorities which they recommended.    If such schemes were tf be undertaken, the general considerations  as to the  emplo:/ment of unskilled labour Indicated above would,  of course, apply.   There are no data available  to enable  a reliable estimate of the number of unskilled workers from tho depressed areas who could be engaged to be made, but as an indication,  based on the assumption that large schemes involving mechanical appliances were to be under- taken, it has been estimated that for every   1,000,000 spent direct employment for about 500 unskilled men                                 -3-
could be found for about 10 years.   If this work were doneentirely at the expense of the taxpayer, a very large proportionof&apos;the unskilled labour employed could be taken from theamount of drainage work that could be done in any one year is limited.S.   The Ministryrs note docs not touch upon field drainageas distinct from arterial drains re, as this is fundamentallya landowner &apos;s liability.   It is work of a very definite benefitto the landowner, and it depends for Its effectlveness upon theditches or dykes which are to receive the additional water being in a satisfactory condition to cope with it.   It als** involves a large amount of material.   The total amount of labcnir required is small and close and skilled supervision and some skilled labour are essential;  the proportion of supervisory labour, If Inexperiencedworkers are used for tho  manual work, must therefore be high-Per these reasons the Ministry ruled these schemes out of Itsunemployment relief programme In order to secure that the schemesactually undertaken absorbed the maximum amount of unskilled labourand conferred the widest benefit.   There would also be immensedifficulties in the way of supervision where Government grants areconcerned In the  case of numerous individual schemes scatteredall over the countryside.   If it were desired at all costs toinclude field drainage  work in an unemployment programme,  these difficulties  could no doubt be faced and a number of small schemescould be put in hand at a fairly early date.   The value of suchworks from the point of view of transference would be very limited,both en account of the scattered and remote nature of the work anddepressed areas.It should be understood, however, that the

But  it  is  possiblethat the work might be used for the purpose  of  testingprospective emigrants.   The Ministry of  Agriculture,however,, are of the opinion that if any additional money is  tobe made available for land  drainage a string priority shouldbe given tc arterial drainage  works,  especially as grants towards fielf&quot;. drainage schemes involve a  subsidy to  landowners.Further, where the soil is  suitable,  the  Ministry&apos;s  policy isto recommend &quot;mole&quot; drainage as the cheapest and most suitable form of drainage.9,   6h the information supplied to us by the Ministry *fAgriculture we do ait think that any  substantial contributionto the problem before us can be found in  land reclamation**r in an extension of rural handicrafts.10.

AgaEXUHS &quot;A&quot; TO ArrSIIDIX II.Hote by the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries with regard to Land Drainage           and Reclamation. (a) Land Drainage.          The question of the carrying out of large land drainage schenes for the relief of unemployment is no new one.   It was tried out during the fire years 1921-1926, when there were two classes of schemes;  those carried out by Statutory Drainage Authorities (which wore dropped during the last year) and voluntary schemes organised by County Councils among landowners.          The proportion of money found by the State varied from 66.2/3rds to 75$ of the actual cost of each scheme, a considerable number of unemployed were absorbod during thewinter months, and a lot of useful work, if of a somewhat restricted kind, was carried out.          The total cost of all schemes, including water supply schemes which were, subject to certain special conditions, included in tho programme, was  1,390,878.   Of this the Government found  907,075, of which  267,000 is recoverable.          These schemes were brought to an end at the end of the five year period for various reasons, mainly because it became increasingly evident that there was little or no unemployment among agricultural &quot;&quot;labourers even in theWinter months, to which these schemes were necessarily restricted.   There seems littlo justification for assuming that conditions have altered since that date;  on the contrary it Is probable that the development of tho sugar beet industry has not only kept the casual labourer of th6 Summer at work on beet lifting for longer into the Autumn, but the sugar beet factories have- tended to absorb such labour later on.          Another reason was that the conditions Imposed as to working in Y/inter months wore tending more and more to prevent Statutory Drainage Authorities from participating in the programme.   The obligations and responsibilities of these. Bodies can only be effectively carried out by the execution of works of a much more comprehensive nature, for which the Summer is the proper and most economical time.          The Government accordingly decided, as from the 1st April, 1926, to provide a sum of  1,000,000 to be spread over a period of years, to enable a more comprehensive typo of schemo to be carried out.   Statutory Drainage Authorities alone Ere eligible for grant and there are no vexatious conditions either as to the time whan the schemes were to be carried out, as to the wages to be paid (unemployment schemes were to be paid for at the agricultural wage), or as to the type of men to be employed, viz., unemployed, ex- service, etc.   These schemes are now in operation,  and the. amount of grant varies from 33.1/3rd^ to 50^ of the  net cost.
          At a subsequent date the scope of tho programme wasconsiderably reduced by the Ministry being required to set aside  625,000 of the  1,000,000 to me t half of anotherliability into which the Government had meantime entered inconnection with certain State-aided works for which provision was made in tho Ouse Drainage Bill, which; however, failedby a majority to pass the Select Committee.   This left a gross figure of only  375,000 available for the present programme and, as the schemes already sanctioned have, with possible extensions, already absorbed this sum, tho ministry had to place an embargo on further schemes, excepting those that could be subsequently sanctioned out of savings.          The present position is as followsj;-     17 schemes have already been completed at a cost        to the State (estimated in throe cases) of ...  18,942     16 further schemes will probably bo completed by        the 31st March, 1929, at an estimated cost        to the State of   ...    ...    ...    ......  58,338     10 other schemes will ultimately be completed        one or two of which will be spread over a        number of years at an estimated cost to the        State of    ...   ...    ...    ...    ... ... 261,130     A few more schemes to be paid for out of savings        savings are now being considered at an        estimated cost to the State of  .........   8,345                                        TOTAL          346,753this figure,          Tho Ministry has no Treasury authority to go beyond-  -      -re, as the difference botweon this and  375,000 isregarded as a reservoir for unforeseen increases on estimates.Two further schemes have,  however, been sanctioned (estimated to involve a Govemmont grant of  45,000) out of tho  625,000earmarked for the Ouse, as it was possible to show that thesetwo schemes were. In effect, in the original programme of theOuse Drainage Bill.          These schemes were not designed primarily for therelief of unemployment, although they inevitably tend to absorb a fair number,  especially Indirectly in works for thesupply of dredgers, excavators, etc.   River clearing work onthe scale that is really needed, and that some day will inevitably have to be  done by somebody, absorbs comparativelyfew unskilled men on account of tho number of technical men required as lightermen and dredgeraen.   A great deal ofcleering work in the fens  is done by contractors who insist on using their own non and will not look at unemployed.    Inany case it would probably bo extremely difficult to enforce a condition as to tho  Importation of men from the distressedarea.          There is no  doubt that although a good deal of useful work has already been done, there are many drainageschemes urgently requiring to be carried out In this country.The Ministry has a waiting list of schemes in connection withits present programme, some of which have dropped out,  some have been sanctioned out of savings, and some still rornain
unsatisfied, especially what are known as the &quot;calamity&quot;cases in Essex that,arose as a result of the January tides.How many.new schemes could bo evolved if the Ministry&apos;sembargo Was lifted Is uncertain, because most StatutoryDrainage Authorities, a few of &quot;whom have already done toan end because of their inability to collect thoir hates,are so without funds that they ere unable to find even their share of any State-aided scheme.          Ho doubt some fresh schemes could be started fairlysoon, but to start a fresh programme of schemes during thecoming Winter on a basis different from that applicable inthe case of the present programme would prove extremelyembarrassing, and to require that tho Drainage Authoritiesshould, obtain thoir labour from tho South Wales and Durhamareas in preference to the small number of unemployed whichmay exist in thoir neighbourhood will prove an obstacle.          The large amount of necessary drainage work wants tobe done primarily in the interests of land drainage with thebest labour and machinery available, and not in the interestsof unemployment relief, although it would naturally relieve unemployment to some extent.   Furthermore, the larger thescheme, the -longer it takes- to organise, having regard to thestatutory requirements, etc.          We are rapidly approaching the time when, if themain rivers and estuaries of this country are to be clearedfor drainage purposes, they will have to be dons either whollyat the expense of the Government, or at any rate under the aegis of a far more comprehensive body  fo.g. a Catchment area authority as recommended by the Royal Commission) than isconstituted under present drainage law.          If it is considered essenc ial .t o open the door to more schemes (e.g. those in Essex), it could be done verysimply by Impinging further on tho money earmarked for theOuse, but applications are likely to bo restricted by anylabour conditions, while the offer of hotter terms ao a price for these conditions would prove very unfair on the firstcomers.(b)  hand He o 1 am at I on.          In the ninds of tho mass, the reclamation of landby means of -unemployed opens up vistas of vast possibilities.There are large potential,areas like the Wash and MorcambeBay that obviously suggest  reclamation, but the question asto how much of such areas is &quot;ripe&quot; in the technical sensefor reclamation is completely ignorod.   Tho Ministry hasbeen consistently opposed to embarking upon reclamationschemes ever since the post-war experiment on the northshore of the Wash where some 360 acres of land were reolaimedat a hopelessly excessive cost per acre.          The following considerations apply to schemes ofthis kind:fl)        There are great difficulties as regards the compulsory acquisition of land , the provisions of the Develop-ment and Road Improvement Fund Act of 1909 being- extremelycumbersome.   This alone generally puts reclamation out ofthe question as an emergency work.
(2)       Reclamation has not yet been found to be economical,even when, as in the case of an area near itii&apos;ig&apos;s Lynn which wafairly recently reclaimed by th6 Commissioners of Crown Lands,the work was done by the latest machinery.(3)       The acre machinery that is used, the smaller thenumber of ordinary unemployed that can be used, contractorspreferring to work their machinery with their own men.(4)       The work of building new sea embankments has to bedone with an oyo on the tides,  end in certain areas docs notlend itself to being carried out too much in the Winter whenstorms and high tides may constantly cause damage.(5)       The normally uneconomical cost is greatly swelledon account of the fact that work of this kind is usually soremote from human habitation that special hutted eanps haveto be prepared, which are of little value for disposal at theend of the work:  also, once an area has been reclaimed thereis a foolish idea that the new area at once becomes a potential farm.   Some years, as a rule, have to elapse before reclaimed land is in sufficiently good heart to beproductive and at the same time a considerable amount ofmoney has usually to be spont on internal drainage, watersupply, and road works;  in other words on equipmentgenerally.          Tho reclamation of the Wash has proceeded, from earlyhistoric times up to the present day in a series of stages,.and it soems likely to continue on these lines, providedtho Commissioners of Crown Lands or other owners round theWash can find sufficient money to make it worth their while to continue enclosure of &quot;ripe&quot; areas.          To attempt to reclaim the Sash at a single bite(merely on the analogy that the Dutch are reclaiming theZuyfier Zee) is a hopeless proposition, as the conditionsare totally different.   The- mouth of the VJash is in deepwater, while in tho case of iiorcambe Bay, there is no evidence whatever that the area would ever become suitableagricultural, land.   There is,  however, definite evidencethat in historic times the bed of the Zuy&amp;er Zee was under cultivation. ;
AfiiraXPHB ;T2!T TO APrEIlDIX II.Note Toy the Ministry of Agriculture as to the             Sugar Beet Industry.          There are at present 19 beet sugar factories inGreet Britain, 18 boing in England and 1 in Scotland.   Mostof the English faetories aro situated in the Eastern, NorthEastern and East Midland Counties, where the bizlk of the sugarboet is grown.   With the exception of 1 small factory atEyhsham, Oxford - which operates the Oxford DesiccationProcess and works most of the year - the factories are &quot;Chelarge-typo with beet-slioing capacities ranging from 750tons to 2,000 tons of beet per 24 hours.   These lar-typefactories work their beets during a period of about 3months from October to -January.          In the 1927-28 campaign, the total number ofworkers employed was 9,022, of whom about 1,500 were skilled.The average duration of tho campaign was 106 days.   Over1,800 men were retained for the off-season for maintenance and repair work.   An innovation in 1928 was tho operation offive of the factories during the off-season in refiningimported raw sugar, but it is not known how many men were re-engaged for this purpose.          The numbers employed and duration of employmentduring the present (1928-9) beet campaign will probably beabout the same as in the beet campaign last year, since,although the acreage under sugar beet has fallen, the totalyield of beets will be much the same as last year owing toa better growing season.   The seasonal unskilled labour inthe factories is drawn mainly from the local urban unemployed,but this year, in response to the Prime MinioterTs appeal,sevox-al of the factories have engaged a number of unemployedminers.          As regards employment in tho boet fields thero werein 1928 about 33,000 growers.   Apart from regular farm hands,it may be estimated that, on the larger holdings, from 5 to10 casual labourers were employed per 100 acres.   Thesecasual labourers are recruited mostly from the unemployed in towns near the factories..   The area grown in 1928 wasabout 180,000 acres.(1) Immediate Employmgnt &quot;Prospects .          The 1928-9 manufacturing campaign is now in fullowing and the factories hare obtained their full complementof labour,   Ho increase in the present employment capacits^of the industry is, therefore, possible in the coming winter.(2) Future Employment prospects.          It is unlikely that further large-scale factorieswill be erected and the beet acreage will probably remain for some time in the neighbourhood of 200,000 acres.   any extension of the acreage would, howevor., have the effect of extending the campaign period of the factories rathar than of increasing the number of hands employed.   There is onedirection, however, in which some increase In the numbers employed may be looked for, and that is in reducing the
length of tho working shifts.    At present,  owing to tho lackof skilled instructors for training tho men  a number of the factories find themselves obliged to work 12 hour shifts but,with the increase In the number of skilled workers,  it  may bepossible to come down to 8 hours.          A conference of tho  factories was  recently convened.by the Ministry to discuss this point,  and the Ministry is satisfied that the particular  factories concerned will  make every effort to adopt an 0 hour shift at the earliest possible moment.          Increased employment in. future may also arise fromdevelopments of manufacturing  technique leading to theintensification and extension  of the industry on the basis of smaller manufacturing units;   other factories may also  go into the refining business in  the off-season.
MHSTOHE WC&apos;* .10 APPENDIX II.iJoto by the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries as to the encouragement         of Rural Handicrafts.          Throe main Bodies are enraged in the encouragement and development of rural industries:-   (1) Rural community councils (formed under the aegis of the national Council of social Service);  (Z) the national Federation of Women &quot;sInstitutes;  and (3) in an advisory capacity, the RuralIndustries Bureau (which is State financed).          Tho first are only at present existent in 15counties.   They are concerned mainly with the operations ofthe village blacksmith;  the village saddler and the villagecarpenter;   and to a lesser extent with such subsidiaryindustries as tho underwood industry, e.g. , hurdle-making, andthe basket-making industry.          The Women&apos;s Institute movement is primarily oocupiedwith the encouragenont of handicrafts of the home industriestype among women, for which they receive a diminishingGovernment grant.          The Rural Industries 3ureau are concerned withaffording technical and expert advice, as regards theindustries themselves, the provision of raw material, andthe marketing of tho finished article.          The Bureau have,  however, in one or two IsolatedInstances,  endeavoured to foster particular industries inthe interests of unemployment.   For example, a specialwomen&apos;s Committee has boen set up to deal with the problem inSouth Y/ales and Durham, so far as the miners&apos; wives and Womenfolk are concerned,  and a scheme for the development of thequilting Industry has boon started and the gale of the quiltsis now in operation and looks like being successful on a modest scale.          Welsh Rural Industries have also received special treatment in that a Committee has been formed by the Univer-sity of Y.&quot;ales for investigating and developing the WelshTextile Industry, and an Advisory and Organising Officer isabout to ba appointed.          Tho Bureau have also appointed a Scottish Sub-Committoe to advise  them as to what can ba dono for thedevelopment of Rural Industries in Scotland.          Generally speaking, however, none of the aboveBodies are  carrying out their duties with an oye to the relief of unemployment, although that may bo an indirect result,  andthere seems no prospect of any rural industries developmentbeing organised to  such an extent as to achieve that object.          The conditions governing,  for example,  the black-smiths&apos; and saddlers&apos;  industries are not at  presentsufficiently prosperous, to  attract as apprentices the younger generation  In the country who are  attracted by theprospects of higher  wages payable in the towns.    Thus theyare hardly  industries  Into  which young minors  could  be drafted.
          The work of the Rural Community Councils and the rural Industries Bureau is mainly designed to render theseoccupations more prosperous, and it is only in this way thatthey would be likely to attract more labour.          There is certainly considerable scope in what are known a3 the &quot;underwood industries&quot; and the various formsof basket making,  but tho prospect of employing &quot;learners&quot;in this trade is generally confined to one or two here orthere at most.    No doubt a good deal could be done for ruralhandicrafts by the introduction of power machinery (on asmall scale) through tho medium of electricity in rural areas.
APPENDIX  III.     THIRD INTERIM REPORT OF THE INTER -DEPARTMENTAL    Activities within the scope of the Ministry of Health,,                  England. and Wales.       i       \1.   There is attached a note by the Ministry of Healthdealing with the recent history of housing and with slum clearance in England and Wales.2.   It will be seen from the Ministry&apos;s note that exceptionallyrapid progress was made in the erection of houses under thesubsidy scheme in the period ending September, 1927, dus to thefact that contracts were rushed to completion in order to takeadvantage of the higher rate of pub3idy which came to an end in September.   After September the rate of progress fell off ve:considerably, but the rate is now once more Increasing and inSeptember this year nearly 13.000 houses were completed.3.   The volume of employment which will be provided bysubsidy house building in England Wales during the coming winter depends largely on a decision as to the future of thesubsidy.   An announcement on this subject is likely at an earlydate.   If it is decided that the subsidy is to be red^^eed atthe end of March, great activity is likely to prevail duringthe coming winter months in order to complete the maximum number of houses to qualify for the existing rate of subsidyby the end of March.   If a&quot;&quot;reduction of the rate of subsidyis postponed until September 1929, winter activity may be lessintense but It Is thought that there will be more employmentprovided In the long run because more schemes will he
-undertaken.   Prices  cf houces  are now  all  in  favour  of rapid building in districts where there i.s  still  a  need.,  for new houses,  and it may be  assumed that  the  subsidy  houseprogramme will be.continued in  the immediate future at a high rate, and at least at a higher  rate  than during the winter of1927/28 and  the spring of  1SE8.4.   The position of  slum  clearance  is  dealt with in  the note attached from which it will be  seen that  there are moreschemes in operation  at the present  time thaniever before,but no great acceleration  of this work  is possible  in presentcircumstances.   The  rate  of progress is conditioned  not BOmuch by finance as by the  difficulty of site acquisition.Legislation to lighten this difficulty  is contemplated butthe Minister of Health ha3 announced that it will not be practicable to introduce such legislation during  this parliament-ament,5.   The anticipated expansion  in subsidy house building incoming months as compared  with  last  winter  and spring will nodoubt lead to a higher level o.f employment  in  the occupationsconcerned.    It must be remembered,  however, that this greateractivity in house building may be offset by the normal seasonalcauses affecting the building trade  generally during  thewinter.   further the &quot;building  and allied trades, which include a large number of workers  not engaged on house buulding,already suffers from  a considerable  volume of unemployment(building 10. 5^ or 35,000;  brick and tile making 11^ or 9,000).expansion in housing programmes, however, will help to counter-act the effect of the ordinary  seasonal tendencies  of employ-ment in the building trade;  it will also make an appreciableindirect contribution to the transfer problem by  maintainingactivity over a wide  field, while at the same  time providingopportunities for transfer from the  depressed  areas.
1 FJ%-4- II Uopmant    6.     We referred. In our first Interim report to the possibleVLB 1-0*5                     ,         use of grants by  the Unemployment Grants Committee to assist         local authorities  in developing sites to be subsequently         used for housing.   Prior to 1925 assistance was granted         for this purpose  by the Committee.   Hie latest terms in         operation permitted the sanction of unemployment grants in         oases in which a  housing scheme on a site had been sanctioned         or was contemplated, whore the development was undertaken for         tho express purpose of relieving unemployment and definitely         in advance of the  time at which the work would have been         earrlol out in the ordinary course of development.   Tho         grant was on tho  terms allowed for revenue producing work         and consisted of  50$ of the interest for 15 yoars on the         expenditure out of loan on the work exclusive of the cost of         land, subject to  the condition th&amp;t when any houaing subsidy         became payable in  respect of houses built on the site the         due proportion of unemployment grant ceased one year before         the first year&apos;s housing subsidy became payable.   Assistance         under these terms, while in theory still available, has in         practice ceased to be available sinco 1925, owing to the         operation of the/stringent acceleration condition then         imposed.         7.     We have looked Into the possibility of a revival of         grants of assistance under these terms to local authorities.         The work of site  development is well adapted to the employ-         mont of unskilled labour and would afford opportunities for         transfer.    Prom tho local authorities-  point of view,         undue acceleration means taking on unremunorative loan - charges,         while, if the acceleration ic  only brief,  the adjustment  of         tho grant on the terms previously enforced  deprives them         largely of the benefit.    Further,  tho  likelihood of a         reduction In tho subsidy next year will  tend,  in England and         Wales at any rate, to raduee the  number  of  authorities  who
will wish to talcs advantage, of assistance towards sitedevelopment.   Some authorities may, however, already possesshousing sites which they must eventually devolop and theymight ho induced to push on with development now Instead of waiting until next summer if assistance from the GrantsCommittee were available.   Though tho number of oaaes where such conditions exist or where site acquisition might becarried through quickly is possibly small, we think that thopossibility of reviving assistance to authorities for sitedevelopment might be considered.8.     For this purpose it would certainly be essential toreturn to the conditions as to ^acceleration&quot; prevailingprior to December, 1925.   As, however, the condition as tothe acceptance of a percentage of transferred labour would,we think, also have to be iaposed, it is probable that the relaxation of the acceleration condition would not by itselfinduce many authorities to apply for assistance.   In thecircumstances we think it would be worth while considering whether, in order to stimulate the undertaking of some workof this kind, grants should not be made on non-revenueproducing&apos; terms, i.e. 75$;of interest and sinking fundcharges instead of 50^ of interest only.   Inasmuch as by itsvery nature a grant for such work could only be givsn for avery short term of years, an objection to an increase in this special class of case does not seem to be material, and neednot lead to difficulties in other oases.ffOTB:  We propose to deal with housing and slum clearances^Scotland lit a separate report.    Paragraphs 6 to 8 above,  -  ..however, would apply in respect of site development In scotland as well as in England and Wales.

              ANNEXIJRS TO APPENDIX  III.              ^              .1.           ,&apos;.           -  .            ^  ../....... :            Memoranflum &quot;by the Ministry of Health.                  Housing and Unemployment.1,   House building undoubtedly provides employment for large numbers of workmen - not only  In the building trade Itselfbut also in the production and manufacture of material, and  inthe manufacture and fitting of equipment for the buildings.   A-very large proportion of the trades  concerned are home trades,a fact which increases the Importance of building work.2.   It must be appreciated, however, that subsidy housebuilding, with which the  Ministry of Health is concerned, isonly one branch of the work performed by the building industry,and that commercial building and house building other than under the ^subsidy schemes forms a much larger part of the work carried out by the industry.3.   In order to judge the extent to which subsidy housebuilding can assist the unemployment problem in the near futureIt is necessary to relate the.recent history of subsidy housingschemes,..     During last year there was a boom In subsidy housebuilding.   A record number of such houses was built during theyear ended 31st March last due in a  large measure to the factthat local authorities had been warned that a reduction In theamount of subsidy payable would take effect in respect ofhouses completed after the end of September, 1927.   As a resultof this announcement special efforts were made to get as manyhouses as possible completed before that date in order to qualifythem for the higher rate  of subsidy, and large numbers of houses were completed which would, normally, have been spread over amuch longer period.   It  was only natural, in view of the factthat existing contracts had been rushed to completion, thatthere should follow a slump.   The now position created by a reduced subsidy had to be explored before building got Into itsstride again,
ioni- U JL4.   After an unprecedented number of over 52,000 housescompleted in September, 1927, the monthly output had fallen byJanuary, 1928, to about 6,000.   By that time, however, it hadbeen realised that the extent of the fall in the price ofhouses, which had been expected by the Government and \*hich thesubsidy cut had been designed to facilitate, made it possiblefor building programmes to be resumed, and had placed buildersin a more favourable posit ion, notwithstanding the reducedsubsidy, than they were In before the cut took place.Consequently building at a more rapid rate took place, and the monthly output gradually increased until during the month ended september last some 13,000 houses were completed.5.   In accordance with the Statutcry requirement a further review of the amount of subsidy payable is n*w about to takeplace, but what the result of that review will be is not yet known.   It has been stated, however, that the present rates of subsidy will be payable for houses completed by the end of march next, and it is therefore not unreasonable t* anticipate thatthere will be a further acceleration of building during thewinter months In order to secure that as many houses as possibleare completed before a further cut takes place.   Prices ofhouses, which are now more than  80 lower on an average thanwhen the announcement of the last subsidy cut was made, are allin favour of rapid building in districts where there is still a need for new houses.6.   There is evidence, however, that arrears of building,particularly for the better paid artisan, have to a large extentbeen caught up in many districts, so that it cannot be expectedthat house-building of the working-class type will continue&apos;indefinitely at the very high rate which has obtained duringthe past three or four years.   The rate of building mustnecessarily taper off as the need is met, although the demand
for a type of house which can he let to the poorer classeswill continue for some time to come.7.   The question of slum clearance work is bound up withthe erection of new houses to rehouse the displaced population and the class of person which has to be catered for is mostlyof the type which can afford only very low rentals.   slum clearance schemes are necessarily slow and expensive owing the many Interests involved in an area marked out foracquisition and clearance, hut there are more schemes inoperation at the present time than ever before.   It is very unlikely that there will be any great acceleration of these schemes for come time to come, although the Excheojaer finanoialassistance which is available has remained unchanged since 1923.It is contemplated, however, that freSh legislation, designedto expedite the improvement of slum areas, will be brought inas soon as possible, although the Prime Minister has statedthat it cannot be introduced until the next Parliament.8.   Summarizing the position It may be stated that theoutput of subsidy houses month by month is on the upgrade and,unless there is a set back as a result of very severe weather,the lower prices now ruling, together with the anticipation ofa further cut in subsidy some time next year, should operate to accelerate the rate of building during the ensuing fewmonths.   It must be appreciated, however, that arrears of house building, owing to the very large numbers of houses built during the last few years, are In some areas beingovertaken, and that consequently the output In future cannot he expected to reach so high a figure as in previous years.     Some statistics are attached having a hearing on thesubject under review.

Q QA F? END IX.      FIFTH  INTERIM REPORT OF THE INTER-DE PART MENTAL      ---&apos;      ^TJB^CQMilgrTEgT      Agricultural  Small Holdings,.,(England and Wales) .1.   Since 1926 the statutory responsibility for the provisionof small holdings has rested upon local authorities (mainlyCounty Councils) who are required to bear approximately 2S?oof the losses Incurred.   The policy of county councils isconservative and cautious and they already have long waitinglists of suitable local applicants for holdings.   It is clearlyimpossible to expect aomity councils on the present financial terms to undertake to provide holdings for persons transferred fromdepressed areas in preference to local applicants with agricultural experience.2.   Any large  schemes for the absorption of unemployed workers from depressed  areas would havo  to be undertaken entirely atthe cost of  the Exchequer and we are advised by the Ministry ofAgriculture  that statutory sanction would bo required for thesuccessful carrying  out  of a scheme on  any  large scale, whethercarried out  by  county  councils acting  as agents for the ministry or by the Ministry direct.   The  latter would  be the quickestand,  In the  opinion  of the Ministry, the  only  satisfactory wayof carrying  out a  scheme  for a special  purpose  such as the relief of unemploymento    (There would  probably be reactions on theexisting  scheme.   County Councils would expect the Governmentto meet the  total  cost of their  programme.   Differentiationcould however be justified on the  ground  that  the new schemewas  devised  specially  for the relief of the depressed areas.)
3.   While in the view of the Ministry of Agriculture ultimatestatutory sanction would he desirable, the Ministry advise us that if it were felt that the gravity of the present situationwarranted immediate steps being taken to provide for the settle-ment of unemployed workers on the land, the Ministry could, if soauthorised by the Cabinet, at once begin to purchase suitableland and to equip it for occupation by small holders.  Legislative                                   ssanction could be given subsequently.   As we understand theposition it would not be impossible to proceed with a scheme onthe basis of voted money and without a statute, but this coursewould no doubt provoke Parliamentary criticism.   compulsory powers of land acquisition could only be given by statute.4.   The amount of land which could be purchased in advance ofthe grant of statutory powers uould probably be sufficient toenable fair progress to be made In the formation of holdings.Apart from a few special cases, the minimum time required, however,for the purchase of land, and the equipment of a holding, includingthe erection of a cottage where necessary, would be from six tonine months.   No substantial number of holdings could be  formed in under a year.   The average  cost of holdings under a schemeproviding for  500 holdings  (averagine:  SO acres each) would be                             0approximately   1,500 per holding.   On such a holding the  average net rental would be  40.    In/xThere is a precedent for such action.   In 1919 the Governmentauthorised County Councils to acquire land for the settlementof ex-service men in advance of Parliamentary sanction, butgave an undertaking that Parliament would be asked to regularise this procedure.   This was in fact done by the LandSettlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, which, although it receivedRoyal Assent in August, 1919, specially provided that thepowers with regard to acquisition &quot;shall be deemed to have had .effect as from the first of January&quot;.iEstimates recently made of the cost of agricultural smallholdings have been prepared on the assumption that any programmeadopted would provide for at least 1,000 holdings.   Under amore limited programme the average cost per holding would be considerably lower.
addition it would be necessary toadvanced-sums /&apos;by-wary-&quot;of -loan to onable holders to stock their holdings and pay fortheir Ingoing valuation.    500 would be the averageamount required.   It would probably have to be given free of interest for the first few years after which interestcould be charged rising to 5$ after 7 years.5.     One of the most serious obstacles In the way of thesuccessful carrying out of the transfer policy is thedifficulty of finding employment for married men withfamilies outside the depressed areas.   These constitute a substantial proportion of the unemployed in the depressed areas.   Any scheme, therefore, which offers a means ofdealing with families merits very serious consideration.Small holdings do offer such a means and though undoubtedlyexpensive, we feol that the gravity of the situation is such that an experimental scheme, providing for theformation of, say, 500 holdings, should bo seriously considered.5.     We are aware of the risks of failure in individual cases.   Vfe are satisfied, however, from the experiencealready gained in the reoruitment of miners as forestholders, that there are large numbers of miners withfamilies who have had considerable agriculturalexperience and would be likely to make successful smallholders.   We think that It should be possible, providedthat the scheme were kept within reasonable limits, to select families with such care that the risks of failurewould be small.7.     Finally we would draw attention to the fact that thoreturn for money spent is not to be measured merely interms of rent received, or of numbers transferred.   The
                                                          1 fjlsettlement on the land of even a relatively small numberof families from the depressed areas would he a step towards correcting the disproportion between rural and urban population and would re-establish in independencefanilios whoso fathers, in the words of the industrial transference Board,  &quot;are growing desperate at their inability to bring up thoir children in decent self-dependence&quot;.   It must be remembered too that 500 families probably represent about 3,000 souls.
