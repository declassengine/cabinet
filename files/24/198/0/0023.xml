(THIS  document is THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos; S&apos;     GOVERNMENT. )0 R E .T.C A,,B I N E T.Copy No. :cA)Lp.  5S5  (88)          Statue in memory of  the  late Field Marshal Earl Haig,Memorandum by the First Commissioner o,f His Majesty&apos;B Works, etc.I shall TBO glad of the opinion of ray colleagues on thefollowing matter.On the 10th February 1928 a motion was passed in the House of Commons that a monument should be erected at thepublic charge to the memory of the late Field Marshal Earl HaigiVarious sites were thereupon considered by my predecessor and were submitted by him to the Royal Fine Art Commission for their advice.The Commission were not able to recommend any of the sitessuggested as being suitable for an Equestrian statue, butthemselves put forward a suggestion that the statue should be erected in the centre of Whitehall opposite the Treasury building.They said that - &quot;Approached down Whitehall from the north thissite is conspicuous and dignified.   At no point on the west sideof Whitehall and only a few yards on the east side would anEquestrian statue at this point intercept the view of the Cenotaph,and thero is also a certain appropriateness in the choice of thissite,&quot;   The Commission recognised that this recommendation mightbe criticised from the point of view of traffic control, but theywere strongly of tho opinion that the advantages of the site were such as should outweigh any objections that might be raised.to obtain the views of the Metropolitan Police and the WestminsterCity Council.   The Police view was that if the statue could be moved a few feet to the south there would be no objection from atraffic point of view, i.e. they saw no objection to such a statuefrom the point ef view of traffic going up and down Whitehall,  butonly from the point of view of the small amount of traffic using the side road.   As will &quot;be seen later, a somewhat different siteOn receipt of this letter the Office of Works proceeded
in Whitehall is now proposed which is free from the objectionraised by the Police to the original site.          The Westminster City Council,  on the other hand, took the line that no further statues of any kind should be erectedin the streets under their control.          A meeting was thereupon held,  attended by representativesof the Office of Works, the Westminster City Council and by theSecretary of the Royal Fine Art Commission.   The latter explained the reason which led the Fine Art Commission to make thisrecommendation, but added that the Commission would agree toanother part of Whitehall provided the statue was placed inrelation to one or ather of the buildings.   He was, however,unable to overcome the objections of the Westminster City Council,who, at a subsequent meeting, adhered to their viows.   The Officeof Works placed various alternative sites suggested by the westminster City Council before the Fine Art Commission, but theywere again unable to recommend any one of them.          The final letter of the City of Westminster, adhering totheir objections, included the following points; (i) The visitsand ceremonies&apos; in connection with the Cenotaph would have been more effective if it had been erected in a quiet place and not Ina great highway.  (S) That persons visiting the Haig statue in whitehall would increase the congestion in that street.(3) That with the increase of traffic in Whitehall the street,even with its present width, would shortly become inadequate forvehicular traffic.  (4) That a statue in that position would notserve adequately as a refuge for pedestrians but only as an obstacle to vehicles.   (5) That a time had arrived when nofurther statues should be placed in the highways.  (ft) That infuture statues should be placed, in the Mall or other similarplace.S.
          It will therefore be seen that there is a directconflict between the artistic opinion represented by the RoyalPine Art Commission and the traffic authorities represented bythe Westminster City Council.   In this, however, the WestminsterCity Council are not supported by the Police, whereas the bodyof opinion represented by the British Legion is strongly infavour of the Whitehall site.          In order partially to meet the objection on the scoreof traffic,  it is now suggested by the Royal Fine Art commission that the statue should be placed opposite the portico of theScottish Office in Whitehall.   At this point in Whitehall theaxial line of the Scottish Office, (representing Haig&apos;snationality) coincides with that of the Royal United ServicesInstitution (representing his profession).   The statue would stand between the..War Office and the Cenotaph, and, in regard tothe front of the Horse Guards building, would balance- the statueof the Duke of Cambridge further to the north.  For these reasons the site would seem to have many attractions from the point ofview of interest and sentiment, whereas the classical lines ofthe Scottish Office portico would make a particularly finebackground,  and tho fact that the statue would stand at the slightangle of tho stroet would make it visible throughout the length ofWhitehall In either direction.   At this point the street is ofconsiderable width and there is no side traffic.   I am not,therefore, greatly impressed by the arguments of the WestminsterCity Council in regard to traffio dangers, particularly as thereis no evidence that accidents have occurred at the Cenotaph orthe Duke of Cambridge&apos;s statue.   Furthermore, it is the opinionof many people, that traffic habitually travels too fast throughWhitehall, only to be held up at either end, and that additionalobstructions in the centre would help to canalise the traffic and to afford additional protection to pedestrians.   The consent
of the Westminster City Council moreover is,  1 am. advised,not legally required as,  under an Act passed in 1854, theCommissioners of Works have powor to erect in any public place within the metropolitan police area any statuo out of moniesvoted by Parliament,1st November, 1928.
