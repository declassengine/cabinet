Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.              The Board of Admiralty consider that the risk involved in      the supply of motor boats and mines to Soviet Russia can be accepted      for the following reasons      (a)     The Russians already employ 9 &quot;Axe&quot; class trawlers for      fishery protection duties in Artie waters,each mounting one 3-inch      gun, as well as 3 Icebreakers, each armed with one 3-inch gun.  The      added risk of motor boats armed with. 5-1 pdr. guns apiece is      negligible.      (b)     The fishing season is during the winter months, from October      to April,  when the weather is better suited to the operations of      trawlers rather than of motor boats.      (c)     The fishing craft of other countries are off the Murman      Coast with the approval of the Soviet Government.  It is unlikely,      therefore, that they would mine these waters.  It is more probable      that the boats and mines are required for use in other regions.              As regards the general naval aspect of the question, if      Russia fails to obtain this material from a British firm, it will be      purchased elsewhere.   It is preferable to be faced with mines whose      potentialities we know rather than with those of which we know      nothing.  Furthermore, if the order is placed in this country the      .date of despatch and the destination of the material will be known,      and this information will be of assistance in judging Its-proposed      employment.ADMIRALTY.  20th November,1928.(Jhtlld).
