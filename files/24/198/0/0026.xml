October 1!*28.Copy No.  2$TO BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be  taken    to ensiirs the secrecy of this document.     CABINET.REPARATIONS AND  WAR DEBTS.       MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.    I WAS on the point on the 30th October of circulating to the cabinet a revised draft of the Note to M. Poincare on the subject of the proposedReparation Enquiry, when the corresponding document from  the FrenchGovernment was delivered at the Treasury.   At about the same time theGerman Charge d&apos; Affaires called upon the Acting Foreign Secretary and left a statement of the views of his  Government on the same question.Translations of these documents are annexed.  After considering them Ihave come  to  the conclusion that it is advisable to make certain  slightmodifications in our  draft.   These modifications  are  embodied  in  theattached document Avhich I propose now to send to the British ambassador in Paris with instructions to him to deliver it personally to M. Poincare onFriday.   The modifications made are as follows :     (a.) In view of the emphasis laid by M. Poincare upon the maintenance          of the Spa  percentages, it has been thought  advisable to omit           anything which might be construed as a direct challenge to the           agreements  now  in force  for regulating the  distribution  of           German payments.    (b.) In order that the British memorandum may. be in a form in which           it can be shown textually to the other Allies, the final paragraph           of  the   original   draft  (relating  to  the ratification  of  the           Churchill-Caillaux Agreement) has been deleted, but Sir W.           Tyrrell  will  be  instructed  to  hand  this  to  M.  Poincare           separately but simultaneously.                                                           W. S. C.    Treasury Chambers,             October 31, 1928.SECRET.CP. 326 (28).(13396)
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Translation of  the  Statement  from  M.  Poincare  transmitted  to  the    Chancellor of the Exchequer by the French Ambassador in London on    October 30, 1928.    HAVING at Geneva given  their  agreement to  the  meeting of  aCommittee of Financial Experts, under the conditions and with the objectsspecified in the announcement of the  16th September,  1928, the  FrenchGovernment, animated by the desire that the forthcoming negotiations shouldpermit the realisation of a fresh and lasting step in the progress of economicand financial reconstruction in Europe,  will enter upon these  negotiationswith the desire to find a practical solution leading to a complete  and final settlement of the  Reparation question.    Having regard  to  the  complex nature  of  the question, the  FrenchGovernment, faithful to the declarations which they have always made, feel bound to recall the very special situation in which France is placed in regardto Reparation payments by the extent of the damage, and especially damage to property, which France has suffered.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairshas already indicated in the conversations at Geneva, France seeks no freshadvantages, but she  would not obtain satisfaction of her duly establishedrights  unless a new  settlement assured  to  her in fact, over  and above  themeans  of  meeting her liabilities to her foreign creditors during the whole period over which she will have to make payments to  them, an indemnityenabling her to meet  the charges resulting from these War damages.    In this connection, the French Government take it for granted that  thenew  settlement cannot in any case modify to  their  disadvantage  thepercentages for the distribution of German payments as fixed by the agree-ments at present  in force.    It is under these conditions that the French Government will be happy to give to the work of the forthcoming Committee the  fullest support.Translation of the Statement left at the  Foreign Office by  the  German           Charge d&apos;Affaires in London on October 30,  1928.    THE representatives of the Governments of Germany, Belgium, France,Great Britain, Italy and Japan, having reached  in Geneva on the  16thSeptember, 1928,  an agreement concerning &quot;the necessity for  a complete and definite settlement of the reparation problem, and for the constitution for this purpose  of a committee  of financial experts to  be nominated bythe six Governments,&apos;&apos; the German Government think it desirable that the six Governments mentioned above should now  come to an agreement as tothe realisation of this plan, and  should take the necessary steps in orderthat the proposed committee can start its work.  According to the  view ofthe German Government  the following points should be stated  for  thispurpose:     (1.) The Geneva Resolution of the 16th September, 1928, only mentionsexperts  of the six countries who  took part in  the resolution; it  would,however, serve the common interest if, besides the national representativesnominated by  each of the six Governments, citizens of the United Statesof America would co-operate in the work of the committee.   The six Govern-ments would, therefore, have to decide which citizens of the United states should be asked to enter the committee as members.    (2.) Following the lines of the first committee of experts, appointed in November  1923,  the  present committee  should  consist of independentfinancial experts enjoying international reputation and authority in theirown countries, and not tied by any instructions of their respective Govern-ments.  The number of members should not exceed three for each, country.   [18396-1]
    (3.) The committee should meet as soon as possible.  The choice of themeeting place will be a question of expediency.  In case Berlin were chosenfor this purpose, the German Government would welcome this choice.    (4.) The task of the committee has already been clearly defined in the geneva agreement by the words &quot; complete and definite settlement of thereparation problem.&quot;   The  committee, therefore,  would  be  given  themandate to make proposals for such a definite  and complete settlement ofthe reparation problem.                                         &apos;  .    (5.) The six  Governments, having reached  agreement on the questionsmentioned above,  would inform the Reparation Commission and invite it toco-operate in due time in order to carry opt the proposals of the  ExpertsCommittee after   the  acceptance  of  the proposals by  the  Governmentsconcerned.
; This  Document is the Property of  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]    The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect  of debts and reparations is  based as heretofore  on the Balfour  Note,  under  which(not as a matter of bargaining, but as a  voluntary act of  renunciation)His Majesty&apos;s  Government undertook to  limit their claims upon their allies  to  such amount as, with  the receipts  of Great  Britain fromreparations, would suffice to meet the liabilities they had incurred  to theUnited States in respect of War Debts.    As was made clear in the Anglo-French and  Anglo-Italian DebtAgreements, the share of Reparations  payable  to the British Dominionsand Colonies cannot be counted in the calculation of British receipts forthis purpose, as these payments in no way benefit  the taxpayer  in theUnited Kingdom.    During the present financial  year  for the first  time, the Britishreceipts from reparations and Allied War Debts together should approxi-mately balance the payments to the United States Government, and it isessential  that in  any  new  settlement with Germany His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be assured  that  this balance between the receipts and payments  of Gi&apos;eat Britain should be maintained during  the wholeeffective currency of the British liability.    In taking this standpoint, His Majesty&apos;s Government are not claiming&apos;for themselves  any peculiar or exclusive privilege.   On the contrary, theyconceive that it is the common aim of all  the Creditor Governments thatany new settlement with  Germany must, in  the  first place, fully cover the liabilities they have each to meet in respect of War Debts.   Theiraggregate  liabilities  under this  head  amount  to  considerably  lessthan the  normal  annuity  of  125 millions under the Dawes  Plan, andHis Majesty&apos;s  Government therefore see  every reason  to  hope  that asettlement could be reached with Germany which would cover not onlythese liabilities and the comparatively small share of reparations  due  tothe  United States and to the other countries  (including  the british dominions) which are not indebted to America,  but would provide a balance available  towards the costs of reconstructing  the devastatedregions.     His Majesty&apos;s Government desire  however  to point  out that  upto the present time  their  payments to the United States Governmenthave substantially  exceeded their aggregate receipts from German repara-tions and Allied War Debts together; and they must  reserve their rightto  deal with  this deficiency  (which now amounts,  with  interest,   to approximately M180 millions), in  relation to the claims of other creditorGovernments  to recover  any  supplementary  payments  over and  abovetheir current debt liabilities.    It is upon this basis  that His Majesty&apos;s Government will considerthe conclusions of the  Expert Committee which  it  has been  agreed  to constitute  upon the total annuities to be paid by Germany.    It is necessary to observe that, at present,  the costs of the Armies ofOccupation in the Bhineland substantially diminish the receipts availablefor Reparations,  and in  order  to  make the largest possible amount available  for Reparations,  these costs should  be brought to an end  as&quot;soon as possible.     The question  of  mobilising  the capital  Reparation  Debt  by the marketing of German  bonds appears to  His Majesty&apos;s Government to  bea  question of expediency rather than of principle.   Unless the GermanGovernment  are  prepared  to undertake the service of reparation loansover and above the current annuity, the service  of any Bonds  marketedmust, pro  tanto, diminish the German annuities available for distribution to  the Allied  Governments in future and the extent  to  which suchmobilisation will  be in the  interests of the  Allied Governments will depend on the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds can be placed,e.g., the rate  of  discount  at which  the  Bonds could be  marketed  ascompared  with the  rate  of discount at  which the proceeds  could   be utilised by the Allied Governments to meet their liabilities.   So long as(in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty) no marketing operation   [l8396-2]
is undertaken except with the unanimous consent of the Creditor Powers,His Majesty&apos;s Government do  not see any objection  of principle  to the study of  the question.  They feel that, on this matter, the advice of an expert Financial Committee might be most valuable, and they would beglad to invite such a Committee to examine  the steps that  can  be takento prepare the way for  a market operation,  without prejudice  to therights of the Allied Governments thereafter to decide whether  such.an operation is expedient.
