This document is  the  property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.9Printed for the Cabinet, October, 1928.SECRET.CP.  314  (28).THE CABINET.FUTURE  BRITISH  GARRISONS  IN  CHINA.       MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR WAR.                   (Former papers-CP. 278 (28) and 279 (28).)     1. The Treasury rejoinder  (CP.  279  (28) )  to the  War Office  memorandum    118proposing the  addition of three British  battalions  to the  permanent garrison in China  Abroad(CP. 278 (28) )  advances four arguments  why the proposed  increase- should not be   1248agreed to :      (a)  That in  view of the effect of increasing the number  of battalions on foreign            service, as pointed  out  in C.I.D. Papers 847-B and 900-B, the proposal, if            accepted,  amounts  to  a confession  that  our present  Army  is  too  small            (paragraphs 2 and 3).     (6)  That  as  there  is no  guarantee that the  increase  proposed  will obviate the            necessity  of reinforcing the garrison in  a future emergency, this increase is a            form of over-insurance (paragraph 6).     (c)  That it would be impolitic (paragraph-7)  to take  any decision at  present for            increasing the permanent garrison.     (d)  That it would  be premature to do  so (paragraph 8) ;  the only immediate atep            required is to secure a reduction  of the  emergency force at present in China.     2. In the first of  these  arguments the Treasury  appear to  be using  the veryarguments advanced by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in C.I.D. Paper 847-B toshow how much our army was  being stretched by the shifting of the strategic centre ofgravity to the East, as reasons for not meeting these new commitments.  The perusal  ofCI.D. Paper No. 847-B can lead to no other conclusion  than that the British Army isnot really adequate for the task which is required  of it to-day.  I accept the inability of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to increase it, and  what I am endeavouring to do is to  advise mycolleagues how best it can be distributed  and where risks must be  taken  in its distri-bution.  The  Treasury make the   point that the  Army Council appear to be preparedto accept  a risk at home in order  to secure an addition to the Far  Eastern garrison.  Iwould remind  the Chancellor of the Exchequer that  the  Cabinet  quite recently, andlargely  at  his  suggestion, re-affirmed the principle  that, in making  our  defence preparations, we should assume that there will be no major war for a period  of  ten years.With  such very  definite guidance as  to the improbability of the Expeditionary  Forcebeing removed from England, except for a non-European war, I  felt justified  in making proposals to eliminate the risk which is acknowledged to exist in the Far East.  I adhere to my opinion  that the time has come for meeting this liability,  and  in this connection Iwould draw my colleagues&apos; attention to paragraph 56 of the Foreign  Office Memorandumdated  5th April, 1928 (circulated in C.I.D. Paper No. 899-B), in which the world situationis reviewed.  In the concluding sentence of this paragraph  the Foreign Office  give it  as their opinion that China will be the danger area  in  international relations so  long as the civil war continues, and I should hesitate to prophesy that we have  seen the last of civil war in China.COPY NO.   2 8(B28/17)  100  10/28 W.O.P. 3933
     3. In their second argument the Treasury endeavour both to minimise the occasions on which it has in the past been necessary for us to send extra troops to China, and at. thesame time to demonstrate that, since the proposed  garrison of&quot; six battalions is-no-hignerthan the pre-war  garrison, which had twice to be reinforced between 1900 and 1927, any advantage obtained from the three extra battalions would  not  compensate us  for theexpense incurred.  On the first point, it is interesting. to - note that both  of the twoemergencies to which allusion is made  in paragraph 6  of  CP. 2f 9j(j28) occurred in thelatter half of  the  50-year period  referred  to  by  the  Treasury,  and  that  therehave been three  such  occasions  in  the  last  28  years.   As  regards  the  secondcontention,  my  advisers  do  not, of course, claim  that  with   a  garrison  of sixbattalions we  should  be able  to meet any. and  every eventuality that may face  us inChina in  the near or distant future.  But even  if, as  happened  in 1911,  it should prove necessary to augment by three, battalions our proposed garrison of six in  orderto  meet  another  extraordinary  emergency,  surely  it  is  preferable to face  such  acomparatively  small  reinforcement than  to adhere  to the  1926  garrison,  with thepossibility of having  to  send  out again reinforcements comparable in. size with the ChinaField Force of  1900 or with the  Shanghai  Defence  Force of  1927.   The  Treasuryargument overlooks one, great  advantage of my proposal, which is  that, as  comparedwith a three-battalion garrison, six battalions would render our  intervention in  a  crisisboth quicker and more effective.   At  the beginning of  1927 there were grave doubtswhether our reinforcements, which had to come from India and from England, would arrive in time.   The  fundamental  principle on which the  British Army is  distributed inpeace time is  that  units should be available in their  proper  positions and  in adequatenumbers before, and  not after,  the occurrence  of  trouble with which they are intendedto deal.     4. In their  third argument  the  Treasury criticise the policy of  strengthening thegarrison at Hong Kong.   The defences of this port have  been under constant review bythe Chiefs of Staffs Sub-Committee for some time past, and it is  their considered opinionthat our defensive arrangements there are far from  satisfactory.   The  argument advanced by-the Treasury  that preparations are  unnecessary to meet an alleged Japanese menace,is. beside the point.  Hong  Kong either is  or is  not wanted  as a naval base.  If it  iswanted, its isolation demands that it should be made  adequately  secure against the onlymenace which is ever likely to threaten  it, namely attack by Japan,   Admittedly such anattack is, at the moment, highly improbable, but it is  the  only  contingency against which Hong Kong has  to  be  defended, and the  scale  of  attack  has  been-worked out  on that  assumption.   Amongst other  deficiencies  in  the  defence is  the  lack  ofan adequate infantry garrison.   We. have  now  adequate  reasons  for  increasing thegarrison, and&apos; I cannot agree that  the  seizing  of  the present  opportunity to  effect this increase should disturb  our existing good relations with Japan.  On the other hand, ifwe defer making  the  necessary increase to the garrison to a later  date when we may find it embarrassing to explain  our reasons, Japan might have every justification for regardingwith suspicion  a sudden  and apparently unnecessary increase.  The Treasury endeavourto  minimize the importance  of certain extracts from  C.I.D.  Paper  900-B which theyquote, in  paragraph 5 (ii)  of CP.  279  (28), without reference  to the context from whichthese extracts  are  drawn.  The whole  paragraph  (No.  38) of the Chiefs  of  StaffsAnnual Review for 1928, from which these  extracts are  taken, is a carefully reasonedappreciation  of the  situation in the Far  East, based upon  a  previous  decision by HisMajesty&apos;s Government that we must be strong enough to deter Japan from attacking usin  that  region.   To  consider  isolated extracts,  out of  their context,  whilst  ignoringimportant and  relevant arguments which are connected with them,  can only  lead to falseconclusions.   When  criticizing the proposals of  the  War  Office, the Treasury are ineffect challenging the policy of the Government  which those  proposals are  intended to implement.      5. Finally, as regards the argument that no urgency exists  to warrant the expenditure involved in preparing for an increase of the permanent garrison at Hong Kong, and thatreductions could be effected in the Defence Force at present in Shanghai.      In pressing  upon the  War Office a reduction in the emergency  forces in  China theTreasury are  forcing an  open door.  Every  reduction  that  has  been effected in the shanghai Defence Force up to date has been carried out at the instance of the War Office,sometimes in the face of opposition from other departments.   I am quite in favour of securing a reduction  in the  Shanghai Defence Force  and of urging the Shanghai Municipality toarrange for its own defence and security.   Where, however, I differ from the Treasury is intheir contention that the present proposal for the increase  to the permanent garrison  ispremature.   It takes time to build barracks, and I am strongly opposed to the principle of
keeping  troops  in  uncomfortable  and  uncongenial surroundings and separated fromtheir  families  when these disabilities can be obviated by the exercise  of  foresight.   Iendorse the views  on  this subject  expressed in CP.  136 (28),  to paragraphs  5 and of which I  would  draw special attention.   The annual relief  of  troops maintained on atemporary basis in China, necessary as it is, is an  expensive  matter.   At the time  theabove paper was written, it was estimated that  this service  was  to cost the State some 300,000.   Admittedly the more the garrison is reduced, the lower will this charge sink ;on the other hand, the  sooner the troops  are properly  housed in permanent barracks  the sooner will this annually recurring charge disappear.   I  think we can reasonably expect that we shall be able to withdraw our last Regular troops from Shanghai in two  or threeyears  time,  and that is  why  I  urge that we should  accept a definite  policy which willadmit of accommodation  being ready in Hong Kong  against the time when we shallwithdraw the last battalion from Shanghai and complete our Hong Ivong garrison to  thestrength which I have recommended.                                                                       L. W.-E.  THE  WAR OFFICE,         24th October, 1928.
