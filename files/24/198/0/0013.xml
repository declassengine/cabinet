The  King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.                     NOVEMBER  6, 1928.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OE COMMONS,    MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.    My Government have been happy to accept the Treaty for the Renunciation of&quot;War in the form proposed by the Government of the United States.   To My great satisfaction this Treaty was signed in Paris on the 27th August by Plenipotentiarieson behalf of all  My Governments, and on behalf of the United States,  France,Germany, Italy, Japan, Belgium,  Poland and Czecho-Slovakia.    In pursuance of their fixed  policy My Government have continued to accordtheir full support to the League of Nations.  They are co-operating in all its currentactivities, and  in particular they have sought fully to discharge their obligations under  Article 8 of the Covenant by reducing the armed forces of this country to the lowest point consistent with national safety and by assisting the League to formulateplans for a general reduction of armaments.    Agreement  has  been  reached with the Governments of  Belgium,  France,Germany,  Italy and  Japan that negotiations should  be  opened in  regard to thepossibility of a complete and definite settlement of the problem of reparations; andit has also been recognised that negotiations should take place relative to the german governments request  for the  evacuation of the Rhineland  at present occupied byBritish, French and Belgian troops.    The Coronation of the Emperor of Japan is shortly to take place, and I take this opportunity, in the name  of Myself and My people,  of wishing His imperial majesty a long and glorious reign. The historic friendship which for so many years has united Japan and  My  country  has  always been  a potent  factor  in themaintenance of peace in the Far East.    I  welcome the efforts which China is making to establish a central governmentfor the whole of that great country and to cope with those forces of disorder whichhave distracted it for  many years past.  I regard the progress of these endeavoursas being of the highest importance,  not only for the safety and prosperity of Mysubjects resident in China, but also for the peace of the world.MEMBERS  OF THE HOUSE  OF  COMMONS,    The Estimates for the services in the coming year will be laid before you in due course.  They are being prepared with strict attention to the continuing need for economy in public expenditure.  In anticipation of the general scheme for relievingagriculture and productive industry from the burden of rates, you will be asked tomake provision enabling railway companies to make lower charges  on importanttraffics of  concern to agriculture, and to the coal, iron and steel industries.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS  OF  THE HOUSE  OF COMMONS,    The situation in the mining areas continues to engage the earnest attention ofMy Ministers, who are taking  energetic steps to promote the success of the schemeof industrial transference and migration.   The abnormal expenditure out of theUnemployment Fund entailed  by the displacement of labour from the mines willrender  necessary an  increase of borrowing  powers, and a Bill dealing with thisquestion will be laid before you.    18384
    Measures will be  presented  to you for giving effect  in  this country  and inScotland to the comprehensive scheme which has been prepared by My Ministers forthe reform of the rating system on a more equitable basis, for the reorganisation oflocal government and for the readjustment of the financial relations between the Stateand the Local Authorities.    I trust that the relief from the burden of rates afforded under the scheme maybenefit agriculture and  lead to a  greater  measure  of employment in industry generally,  and in particular in those basic trades whose  condition  still  causesconcern.   The proposed changes  in local government and in the relations betweenthe Exchequer and Local Authorities are measures of far-reaching importance.   my ministers anticipate that they will promote efficiency and economy in local  govern-ment, will enable better provision to be made for the health of the people, and willdirect assistance particularly to those areas whose needs are most pressing.    Proposals for extending the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme for a  further period will be laid before you.    You will be invited to pass a Bill authorising the appointment of two additional members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  and of one additional Lordof Appeal in Ordinary.    Among other Measures a Bill  for assisting  persons engaged in agriculture inScotland  to  obtain  credits  required  for  the pursuit  of their industry  will beintroduced.    And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your deliberations.
