THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT) .S E C R E T.                                         COPY NO-^&quot;V cp. 501 (28).                              CABINET.DISARMAMENT.Memorandum by the President of the Board of                Education.     I venture to put on paper my views  as  to the  policy weshould adopt at this moment in regard  to  disarmament.     It is not easy for a member of the  Cabinet, who hastaken no part in the deliberations of  Cabinet Committees and committees of the Committee of Imperial  Defence  on thisqueation, fully to appreciate how the  present situation has.arisen, but it has become increasingly evident during thelast three years that we are drifting  further and  further into a position from which neither this  country  nor the Leagueof Nations can emerge with credit.     There are two points of view from which one can regardtre Preparatory Commission.   One can  regard It  either as a means of effecting a real limitation of armaments  in thecause of peace or as an attempt to make such a show of disarmament as will postpone as long as possible the Inevitablemoment when the German Government will claim the abrogationor the modification of the special disarmament provisions ofthe Treaty of Versailles.   It Is worth while to run greatrisks in order to attain the first of these ends and it maybe worth while to run some risks in order to attain thesecond;  but if there is no substantial prospect of attainingeither of them it would be worth Fhlle to run almost any
risk in order to end the life of the Commission at theearliest possible moment.   Whichever view one takes of theCommission^ purpose, its proceedings are in themselves a positive menace to the peace of the world in general and tothe peace of the British Empire in particular.   This is inevitable from the very nature of the Commission^ work.It is the business of the Commission to prepare a framework for the detailed comparison of the armaments of one country with those of another.   All such comparisons are boundto be more or less invidious&apos;and it is only a short stepfrom Invidious comparisons to competition;  so that theCommissionrs work is constantly exciting among the leadingPowers the very jealousies which it is the object of the eventual Disarmament Conference to allay.   These Powers,however, are naturally anxious to conceal their mutualjealousies from the minor Powers represented on the Commission,and the easiest way of doing this is to direct attentionto a subject on which, all European nations, great and small,can express themselves with equal irresponsibility - i.e. theBritish Navy.  . Our unique position as a Naval Power offers an easy opportunity for every nation which does not reallydesire disarmament to put forward schemes for naval limitationwhich impose a limit on no one but ourselves and thus force us into the position of being the sole obstacle to agreement.The tendency of the Commission&apos;s proceedings is thus to diminish rather than to increase the feeling of security onwhich both peace and disarmament must depend and to make theBritish Empire the scapegoat for the insincerities of other nations.   My impression is that all my colleagues share thisview.   This being so, it is clear that it should be no part of our policy to make tactical moves v^ith the sole objectof prolonging the life of the Preparatory Commission.    any move we make must be based on some solid calculation ofattaining one or other of the ends which can alone just ify therisk inherent in the Commission&apos;s methods.                              -2-
     Now; neither the Anglo-French compromise. nor anyother proposal which, so far as I kno&apos;% has yet &quot;been putforward, seems to he based on any such calculation.   Indeedas I understand it, our motive in consenting to the AnglosFrench compromise was little more than a desire to secure a better tactical position and to give the Commission some-thing to talk about.   Its net result appears to have beenthat whereas hitherto we have had the general supportof the United States and Japan in the naval discussions on the Commission, we have now the support of Japan andFrance, and that we have committed ourselves to a view Inregard to land armaments to which neither the GermanGovernment nor the United States Government will ever agree.     If this is so, has not the time arrived when we shouldmodify our whole attitude towards the Commission?   As i see it the present situation offers.us an opportunity todo this, which may never recur.   Fe can claim to have done&apos; ?our best to assist the work of the Commission;  we can putforward a strong ce.se on merits for the reasonableness ofour proposals;  and we can make the rejection of our proposals the occasion for taking up a more independentattitude towards the Commission than we have done in the past.The great tactical strength of the position of the UnitedStates Government at this moment is that they can at any moment withdraw from the Commission or refrain from sending representatives to any particular meeting It mayhold.   No obligation rests upon them under the Covenant;.they can represent their participation in the work of theCommission as a kindly act of moral condescension;  the prestige of their policy is not Involved in its successor failure, and they can at any moment exact a price fortheir continued participation.   It seems to me that our
policy should be directed to putting  this  country,so far as possible,  in the same position.     I will not attempt at this stage to work  out  on paper the future implications of  such a policy.    Theimportant point at the moment is  that o\p/&quot;\neply to theUnited States Note should take a  form which will enable us to begin to disengage ourselves from a  confused dispute in which we have really little interest but ;.n which we are becoming dangerously involved.    I venture, therefore, to annex the kind of rep&quot;;y which I think we ought to  send.                          E.P.                                                        &apos; ?mBoard of Education,   12th October, 1928.
                          REPLY,        His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  Great  Britain appreciate thefranis: manner  in which,  the Government of  the United States haveexpressed their views  and they  arc glad  to reply  with  equalfrankness.        At the outset  it  should &quot;be made  clear  that it  is no partof the Policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in Great Britain tonegotiate special agreements in regard to  armaments either with  theFrench or with any other  Government.  The  numbers  and  equipment  ofthe armed forces of Great -Britain are not  based on any comparisonwith the forces maintained by other  nations;   they are  not a material factor in determining  the general scale  of  armaments andit has long been evident  that their  reduction  can  offer no sub-stantial inducement to other nations to effect similar  reductions.In consequence of the policy adopted by Eis .Majestyrs  government since the war,, a policy which they have, moreoverr no  intention  of abandoning, British armaments, both  on land and in the  air,-are greatly inferior to those of other leading Powers;  while  on  thesea they are weaker in comparison with foreign navies than at  any previous period in history.  If reductions of this magnitude  havehad little influence on the policy of other nations., it  is  clearthat the signature of Els JJajesty&apos; s Government could of  itself con.-tribute little to the practical efficacy of any agreement  for  thelimitation of armaments.  If, therefore, Eis iJajestyTs  Governmentwore guided exclusively &quot;by practical considerations or by  care fortheir own interests,  they would not feel called upon to take any active part in discussions about disarmament and would certainly not have undertaken to formulate definite proposals as a basis forsuch discussions.          Having,  however, agreed to  take part&apos;in the proceedingsof the Preparatory Commission at Geneva, Eis iiiajesty&apos; s Governmenthave felt a responsibility to assist  those  proceedings&apos; to thebest of thoir ability.  The discussions of that Committoe have                               -5-
reached a deadlock in regard both to military and naval disarmament.  As regards naval disarmament, the French andItalian Governments, followed by other Governments, haveadvocated a method of limitation based on global tonnage.The British, United States and Japanese Governments, on theother hand, have been in general agreement in advocating theprinciple of limitation by categories, on which the WashingtonAgreement was based;  but they failed at the Geneva conference to reach complete agreement as to the application of this principle.   The Geneva Conference revealed three main difficulties:  the inability of the United States to accept aseparate category of large cruisers, in view of her specialneed for vessels of long cruising range,  the inability ofGreat Britain and the Dominions to accept a low limit of     cruisertotal/tonnage in view of their special need for a considerablenumber of small patrolling vessels, and the reluctance of theUnite States to contemplate a lighter armament for cruisersthan the 8&quot; gun.  The United States appeared,  however,  to layloss emphasis on the third content! on than on the first.In these circumstances,  the prospect of removing the deadlockon the Preparatory Commission seemed to depend on finding a compromise which would,  on the one hand,  partly meet the need of the United  States for large cruisers  and,  on the otherhand, would partly satisfy the desire of  the Preach andItalian Governments for greater freedom of action than theywould-enjoy under a system of limitation  by strict categories.          The Anglo-French proposals embody such a-compromise.They include in one category the cruisers of long cruisingrange desired by the United States and the smaller patrollingcruisers desired by Great Britain;   they  leave all nationsfree in regard to the building of these vessels and of other
small surface vessels and submarines;  and they confine the separate category of powerful cruisers to those carrying the 8&quot; gun.   H.11. Government have, moreover, no intention ofsuggesting that the United States Government should accept a lower limit in this separate category than would enable themto build the number of powerful cruisers which they believe to be necessary to their special needs;   nor, if a similarconsideration is accorded to the special needs of the BritishEmpire in respect of the less powerful cruisers, would theyoppose, so far as they are concerned, the fixing of a separatelimit for those vessels also.   In fact, as the United StatesGovernment are now aware, the proposals submitted by H.M.Government to the French Government in March provided for thelimitation of vessels of all types.   They share the desire ofthe United States Government for the abolition of submarines and, from the point of view of their own national security,.theyhave an even stronger interest than the United States Governmentin fixing a limit for smaller, as well as for larger,submarines;but,if they were willing to incur the risk involved in accepting the views of the French Government on this point, they hoped that other countries, less exposed than Great Britain to serious dangerfrom the operation of submarines of short cruising range, mightnot refuse to make the same concession for the sake of securinggeneral agreement.     It would appear, therefore, that the only substantialpoint of difference remaining between H.M.Government in GreatBritain and the United States Government is the use of the 8&quot; gun for cruisers.   On this point II.1,1. government feel obliged to speak with the utmost frankness.  The useof the 8&quot; gun is a new factor in cruiser construction.  Itis abundantly clear that the maximum armament fixed forany category must inevitably tend to become the standardarmament for that category.   To fix for any category a
maximum armament substantially in excess of past and  currentstandards is contrary to the. principles adopted at  theWashington Conference In limiting the construction  ofcapital ships and must result In an increase  in armaments and an increase in expenditure.   That has, in fact,  beenthe result of the introduction into the Washington  Agreementof the 8&quot; gun for cruisers.   The use of that gun for cruisersformed ho part of1 the naval policy.of H.M. Government at thetime of the Washington Conference and the United StatesGovernment have waited for a number of years  before adoptingIt, but both Governments have been obliged by the general trend of naval construction since the Conference to undertake the building of cruisers carrying this gun, and the UnitedStates Government have now, apparently, been  led to the  con--elusion that no lighter armament for&apos;cruisers will&apos;meet their needs.   That conclusion H.M. Government have ho right-, to question;  but they have a right and a duty to appeal to  the:&apos;United States Government not to make their own special needs for heavy armament a  standard  for  all the  cruisers  of all thenaval Powers by including  all  cruisers  in  the same  category.To  fi&quot; so high a  limit for  the armament  of all new  cruiserswould, in the view of H.M. Government, be  a retrograde stepand would be definitely worse  than  to. fix  no  limit  forcruiser  tonnage at all.      Such,  then,  have been the origin and  Intention of theAnglo-French proposals and such  Is.the  one remaining . pointof  difference between the -policy -of H.M. .Government and  that.of  the United  States  Government.    They.trust that  the UnitedStates Government will not be  unwilling  to  give  further consideration  to  this point, with  a view to  a reasonable compromise;  but  unless.such a  compromise  can be  reached and unless  the  other Governments concerned can  arrive at an. agreement with the United States Government,  on the points
on which the British and American views are in accord, but,an which H.M. Government have bean ready to waive theirviews In the interests of a general settlement,, it would, inthe view of H.M. Government, be better frankly to recognisethat the Preparatory Commission is unable for the present tomake any advance in naval disarmament outside the scope ofthe Washington Agreement.   If the United States Governmentare prepared to consider the proposal made by the ItalianGovernment for an extension of that Agreement for a further period, H.M. Government would welcome such an extension.For the rest. It seems plain that,&apos; for the present,.more reallimitation of naval armaments is likely to be effected inpractice by the pacific tendencies of popular government andby the pressure of financial considerations, aided., by such general declarations of pacific policy as the recent Pact forthe Renunciation of V?ar, than by contentious discussions which may tend to harden national policies and excite mutuarsuspicions.   H.M. Government have discharged their responsi-bilities under the Covenant of the League of Nations by the reductions in armaments which they have, In practice, effectedsince the war;  they have  discharged their responsibilities to  the Preparatory Commission by putting forward, in concert with the French Government, the only workable compromise yetsuggested between the  conflicting views which have hithertocrippled the work of  that  Commission..   They can now  onlyawait  the action which other Governments may feel able totake,  or  the alternative proposals which they may feel ableto  put  forward.
