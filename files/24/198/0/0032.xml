LOCAL GOVEB2MENT  (SCOTLAND) BILL -* THE                    PROK)SED CLAUSE 24  (i).            MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECKETAKT OE STATE.-3?OH  SCOTLAND.          It may be for the convenience of ray oolleagues tliatI should summarise the difficulties whioh prevent me fromacquiescing in the decision1 reached by the Home AffairsCommittee regarding this subsection, a copy of which is appeooded.     1.   The attitude that all public service of the kind should be given gratuitously can no longer be defended as ageneral principle, since Members Of Parliament receive a salary and are allowed the cost of travelling betweenWestminster and their constituencies.     2;   in this particular case we have to reokori with a practice that has been established for ten years.  The powers which the clause would confer upon county authorities areidentical with those which were oohferred upon educationauthorities in 1918.  All the evidenoe goes to show that thelatter have exercised their, powers wisely-.  There is, there*fore, no case for withdrawing them on the ground that they havebeen abused.     3.   It is now proposed to abolish parish oouncilsprecisely as parish school boards were abolished in 1918,and the arguments formerly used in support of payment of expenses, etc., have lost none of their cogency.  Without some provision of the sort, it would be unreasonable to look for adequate local representation on the central body in the numerous cases in which attendance at a meeting will involve an absence from home of anything from two to five days.     4.   To cut out the large burghs from the provision, as has been suggested, is emphatically not worth while for all themoney that would be involved.  Indeed, the chances are that more than would be expended in these under the new provision would be saved by the stricter control which Clause 24 (4)would make it possible to exorcise over ordinary deputation andother expenses,     5.   During the past few weeks I have been in close touchwith Unionist Members of Parliament and Unionist Organisersthroughout Scotland, and I am satisfied that the decision ofthe Home Affairs Committee, if endorsed by the Cabinet,  willplace the members of our Party in such serious political                                                 difficulties/

At every meeting they will be faced with the charge that local government is to be handedover to the leisured and wealthy classes, and they do not see what answer it will be possible for them to make.     6.   It is quite certain that a large section of opinion in Scotland which is at present favourable to the changes proposed - including a considerable body of Labour opinion -will be definitely antagonised, and the forces of opposition,already strong enough, strengthened to a formidable degree.Why should this be allowed to happen if, as I think only toocertain and as my colleagues on the Home Affairs Committee wereprepared to consider possible, the concession will ultimatelyhave to be made?     7.   While I fully appreciate the view that it is undesirable to prejudice the position in England by anything that we, may do in Scotland, I am of opinion that a controversyas to Scotland, followed by an ultimate concession, would bemuch more dangerous from the point of view of England thanwhat would be, after all, nothing more than a frankrecognition of what is called for by the special circumstancesof Scotland, geographical and political.     8.   Neither in Parliament nor out of it could the realreason be given without putting a convenient weapon into thehands of those who are now busy organising the so-calledScottish Nationalist Party - a Party which seems to be gainingadherents in unexpected quarters.&apos; JOHN GILMOUR1Scottish Office,    Whitehall.2nd November,  1928,          APPENDIX.
