November 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.                                             Copy No,   28CP. 344 (28).                    ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.       Note by the  Acting  Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs.    THERE can be no doubt  that the unsatisfactory  state of our relations withthe United  States,  which recent events have  emphasised,  is  causing  widespreadmisgiving in the country, and that if nothing can be done to improve these relations in the next month or two, they cannot fail to have a very unfortunate influence onthe elections, besides being highly injurious to the national interests.    In order that the Cabinet may obtain a fairly comprehensive view of the presentsituation in  this respect, the annexed memorandum has been written at my request by Mr. Craigie, of the Foreign Office, who has exceptional knowledge of Americanpolitics and  personalities.  The problems to which he refers, or some of them, havebeen under  investigation for some  time by  separate sub-committees,  but  without much progress  towards satisfactory solution.  They  are all,  in  reality, differentfactors in Anglo-American relations  as a whole, and, if time could  be found forthe purpose,  should  be studied as such by the Cabinet, especially in connection with two recent occurrences, which ought to influence policy in regard to them.  I refer to (1) the Kellogg  Pact and  (2) the Prime  Ministers declaration that we  do not intend to build ships in competition with the United States.    To what extent are these two pronouncements really to be taken at their face value, and what inferences are to be drawn from them and translated into practicalpolicy 1  It is obvious that the answers to be given to these questions must largelyinfluence the solution of the various problems which, as Mr.  Craigie shows, are nowdisturbing our relations with America.    I hope, therefore,  that,  although Mr.  Craigie&apos;s memorandum  is  somewhatlengthy, my  colleagues will be able to find time to give it careful consideration.

IT is  probably safe  to  say  that at no time since 1920 have Anglo-american relations been in so unsatisfactory a state as at the present moment.  Between that&apos;year and 1923 a series of events occurred which had a profoundly beneficial, effect on those relations;  the Mesopotamian oil question was settled, the Irish Free State was created, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance wasabrogated  and the debt settlement  took place.  In the United States the  effect ofthese events and particularly of the debt settlement was to place the name of Britainhigher in the esteem and  regard  of  the  American people than at any  previous time within living memory.  In this country there was undeniably a feeling of exasperationat the harshness of Americans debt settlement terms, but with it there was a sense ofgratification  that British prestige  should  have  gained  immeasurably from  thesettlement.    As late as 1926  this earlier improvement in  relations was  reflected in  the negotiation of  an agreement under  which the great mass  of American war claims against this country were wiped  out by a process of gradual elimination leading toa  final cancelling-out of inter-Governmental accounts.   The  agreement,  whichunostentatiously removed  a potential source  of serious friction, showed what can bedone with the United States  Government when they are approached in  the right way and after proper preparation of the  ground.    Taking all in all it is.probable that during the years 1923-25  the  curve of goodfeeling between the countries touched its highest point.  Then  began the differences in regard to the limitation of cruisers and other auxiliary naval craft.   It had beenwrongly assumed throughout the United States that at Washington  the BritishEmpire had accepted the principle of equality for all naval craft i.e.,  &quot; parity &quot; all along the line.   The United  States Administration of the day, anxious to make  themost of their achievement of  1922, did nothing to dispel this widely held assumption.Well before the  Three-Power Conference at Geneva  the  Big Navy  party in theUnited  States  had  seized on this  popular  misapprehension  to  bolster up  their demands for more and bigger cruisers.   During and after that conference they heldthis country up to criticism  and  obloquy on  the ground that we had gone back on a principle previously accepted. The  Geneva failure dealt a shattering blow to ourgTowing popularity in the United States of America-the more shattering in that itwas  entirely unexpected  by the great  mass  of  Americans,  from the Presidentdownwards. The Anglo-French compromise  failure has turned a feeling of resentful      4643  [18364]                                                    B
 surprise into one  of  irritation  if  not of exasperation.  . So far  as the outward manifestations of  feeling in the United  States are  concerned, we appear to be reverting to the position of 1920.     There  is,  however, an important difference.   In 1920 the great mass of the population   was  ill-disposed  towards  this  country.   To-day large  sections  of the community are on the whole better disposed, but, in so far as they bother their heads about matters of defence and  foreign policy, they are goaded into a temporary exasperation by the cleverly contrived and insidious propaganda of the  Big Navy party.  In other words, the anti-British feeling has not yet gone so  deep- as in the years before 1920, appearances in the sensational press notwithstanding;  its growth is being artificially stimulated to serve  the  ends of a determined  section  of the community, but the process is slower than would have been the case before 1920.  The eA^ents of 1920-23 have created a  large reservoir  of  goodwill  which can only be completely drained by a persistence in the United States of the belief that Great Britain is determined to thwart the aspiration of the  United States  to have a fleet &quot;second to  none.&quot;Irremovable and Inherent Difficulties.    Mutual  jealousy;  the clash of  differing national characteristics emphasised by the existence of a common language; the growing discrepancies  of speech and style within that &quot; common  &quot; language;  intensive  trade rivalry; determined competition between  the two merchant marines;  the uneasy relationship between debtor and creditor these are some of the permanent  factors in Anglo-American relations theeffect of  which can at  the  best only  be  slightly mitigated by tactful handling.  Butthere are a number of other difficulties which are not incapable of removal throughthe exercise of a patient diplomacy  taking account  of things as  they  are,  not as wewould wish them to be.  If, through an insufficient realisation of their wider politicaland psychological aspects,  we allow these removable irritants to sap what remains ofgood  feeling in each  country  towards the other,  we  shall  be drifting towards a situation of real gravity.   Except  as  a figure of  speech, war  is not unthinkablebetween the two countries.  On the contrary,  there are  pressnt all the factors whichin the past have made for &quot;wars between States. It is dangerous to rely too exclusivelyon considerations  such as  the newly-signed Kellogg Pact, the commonsense  of thetwo  countries,  the strategical difficulties in the way of a war with the UnitedStates, &amp;c.  A more positive policy  seems to be called for.  Even those who despair(perhaps too easily) of the  possibility of  really cordial  relations between  GreatBritain and the United States of America will admit  the dangers inherent in any future policy which permitted things to drift from  bad to worse.Network of  other Problems susceptible of Solution.    At the  present moment a number of problems  of  the first magnitude await asolution,  all of which are interconnected and all  of  which intimately  affect ourrelations with  the  United States.   The  problems are: The conclusion of a navallimitation  agreement  at  Geneva;   the controversy  in regard to the exercise  of belligerent rights at sea and the possible summoning of an international conferenceon the subject by the United States; the Conclusion of an arbitration treaty with theUnited States; the settlement of the reparations  question, which has been broughtsharply into prominence by the question of  the evacuation of the  Rhineland;  theprobable trouble in the United States Senate over the so-called British reservations tothe Treaty for the Renunciation of War.    The  Rhineland problem  depends  for solution on a reparations  settlement;although it is dangerous to prophesy before the forthcoming meeting of the expert committee,  it is probable that a satisfactory reparations settlement can only  beachieved with the aid  and co-operation of American finance in some  form or other(quite apart from possible  future action by the United States Government in respectof war debts); it is not unreasonable, to suppose that American aid and co-operationmay be more difficult to enlist at a moment when the United States is acutely irritatedover the  successive  failures to achieve any agreement on naval limitation; a navallimitation agreement could probably be more easily achieved if the belligerent rightsdifficulty could first have  been cleared out of the way.   Similarly,  the conclusionof the American  draft arbitration treaty  would have  been  greatly faciliated by the elimination of  belligerent rights as a likely cause of arbitral controversywith the United States.  Finally, the passage of the Treaty for the Renunciation
95 9O U d)of War through the United States Senate should afford some indication as.to theprobable attitude of the United States towards the inclusion of a &quot; special regions &quot;clause in the new arbitration treaty.    So  interconnected are these problems that a failure to solve one of them may result in all being left in a state of suspended animation.  Conversely, the solutionof one tends to smooth the way for the settlement of the next.  At present they forma vicious circle, each unsolved problem delaying and complicating the solution of the others.  The circle  can be broken, but there would seem to be two prerequisites tosuccess:  (1)  The formulation of a general policy to be applied uniformly to thesolution of the whole set of problems;  (2) the balancing of political considerations,based upon that general policy, against technical considerations.   All the problemsnamed above are, either directly or indirectly, Anglo-American problems.  Even thesolution of the  reparations question may be  found in the last resort to depend uponthe state of the relations between Great Britain and the United States of America.The formulation of a definite policy must therefore in the main depend on the  answer to this question : What is the value to us of good relations with the United States ?    In reply to this question, it is only possible in the present paper to summarisebriefly a number of considerations, each of which really  requires more exhaustivetreatment.   Much of what is stated  may  appear elementary, but  the elementarysometimes escapes notice.Elements in Situation necessitating good Relations with the United States.     (a.) Great Britain is faced in the United States of America with a phenomenonfor which there is no parallel in our modern history-a State twenty-five times as large, five times as  wealthy, three times as populous, twice as ambitious, almostinvulnerable,  and - at least  our  equal  in prosperity,   vital  energy,  technicalequipment and industrial science. This State has risen to its present state of develop-ment at a  time when Great Britain is  still  staggering  from the effects  Of  thesuperhuman effort made  during the war, is  loaded with a great burden of debt andis crippled by the evil of  unemployment.  The interests of the two  countries touchat  almost  every point,  for  our contacts  with  the  United  States political andeconomic,  by land  and  by sea,  commercial and financial are  closer and more numerous  than those existing with any other foreign State.  In such circumstancespolitical relations can seldom stand still they must either improve or deteriorate.Every consideration of discretion and common sense seems to dictate  that,  if everthere is to be a trial of strength between the Empire and  the  United States, this isnot the moment to choose for it. It may, indeed, depend on the handling of  Anglo-American relations during the next few years whether or not that trial of strength is to be averted for all time.    Having regard to  the irremovable sources of friction mentioned in paragraph 5,.Anglo-American relations have a natural tendency to  deteriorate unless  they  are carefully watched and tended; unless, that is, differences which are susceptible ofremoval are eliminated before they grow to unmanageable dimensions. The situationss beginning to  resemble that which existed as between this country and Germany inthe years immediately  preceding 1914, with two main differences: (1) Many of our difficulties with the  United States  are  susceptible of removal by dint  of judiciousdiplomacy, whereas our difficulties with Germany were irremovable; (2) in the caseof Germany, we were never seriously  threatened with loss  of naval supremacy,whereas the threat  from the United States is  unquestionable, and,  if  persisted  in,is beyond our power to avert.  There is already some talk in America about &quot; building to a two-Power standard,&quot; which would not&apos; overstrain  the resources of the  UnitedStates.  Bad relations with the  United  States  tend  to  create an enthusiasm,  inAmerica for the &quot;biggest navy in the world,&quot;  which would commit  us either to  animpotent confession  that  our naval supremacy has gone  for  ever or  to an  era  of competition ruinous to our finances.                                  &apos;          .    &apos;(&amp;.) Any policy of estrangement from  the United States would  put a greatstrain on inter-imperial ties.  The United States is, to begin with, the only first-classPower directly bordering on a part of the Empire.  This makes for vulnerability.Canada, for instance, finds  a great  difficulty  in understanding the case  for theBritish  attitude at the Geneva Three-Power Conference and for the Anglo-Frenchcompromise.  If good relations with the United States are a, matter of importance for Great Britain, for Canada they are at matter of life and  death.  If Canada is actually contiguous with  the  United States, the  bulk  of  the rest  of  the Empireborders, like the United States, on the Pacific and Pacific problems are bound  to       [18364]                                                        B  2
loom more and more importantly in international affairs.  In fact it can be said,without fear of contradiction, that, in the eyes of the Dominions, the importance ofgood relations with the United States far outweighs the importance of relations withany other country.  M. Andre Siegfried, in a recent book, remarks that Australiaand Canada both look on the United States fleet as a &quot; reinsurance &apos;*&apos;&quot;  against eventualinundation by the yellow races and quotes Mr. Hughes&apos;s  remark (when  Premier ofAustralia) &quot; I hail with joy  the laying down of  every new American battleship.&quot;Now, if we are to treat with  the United States on  comparatively  equal terms, wemust have the full support of the Dominions behind us, and that support will not be forthcoming for a policy of estrangement unless the  Dominions are satisfied that thereis no other honourable  course open to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   As things standthere is no argument by  which we could persuade the Dominions  that  a policy of friendly adjustment of Anglo-American differences  is no longer possible.     (p.) In Great Britain the  popular feeling on this point appears to  differ fromthat in the Dominions only in degree.  Those sections of the community who come in contact with  Americans of the more conceited and aggressive type, who reflect onthe harshness of the debt settlement or who resent the aggressive naval, mercantileand commercial rivalry of the United States,  are  frankly anti-American.  But thefeeling does not seem to descend very low in the social scale, and, such as it is,  doesnot prevail against the extraordinarily  widespread sentiment that, whatever elsehappens, Anglo-American relations must not be allowed to drift into stormy waters.Whether it is the instinct of self-preservation or whether it represents a reasonedanalysis of our needs, there can be no doubt that this idea is strongly entrenched inthe public mind. To dislodge it and to justify a deterioration in our relations withthe United States would  seem to require some more cogent argument than can beadduced at present.  This attitude of mind has often in the past militated  againstthe adoption  of a reasonably firm British attitude towards the United States; itmanifested itself strongly after the failure of the  Geneva Conference;  it made itspresence felt even more strongly after the announcement of the Anglo-French navalcompromise.   The criticisms of the British press  on this subject have  often beenuninformed and wide of the mark;  but,  even  allowing for political differences andthe love of the sensational, these  criticisms undoubtedly proceed in the main from a fundamental  feeling that  quarrels with  the United  States  are  hazardous  and unnecessary and therefore to be avoided.  Apart  from the  merits or  demerits of anyparticular dispute, a deterioration in our relations with  the United States alwaysgives an excellent stick with which to belabour the Government of the day.  In thefield of foreign policy there is probably no form of  criticism which can be used with more telling effect in the country.     id.) The  existence of satisfactory relations between Great Britain and theUnited States must necessarily increase our influence  and prestige in the councils ofEurope. It is perhaps for this very reason that the Europeans are constantly trying to drive a wedge between this country and the  United States.  Instances of this tendency are numerous, and mention need only be made here of the French attitudeat the opening of the Washington Conference in 1922 and the French effort to give awrong  &quot;twist&quot; to  the  recent  Anglo-French compromise by  exaggerating   its implications and by making calculated &quot;leaks&quot;  in regard to its provisions.   Thetendency is  a perfectly natural one, but there is  no good reason  why  we  should contribute to  its success.    One  French  theory appears  to be that  good relationsbetween Great Britain and the United States may  eventually lead  to an Anglo-German-American combination.    The  fear  is  groundless, and, indeed, appearsabsurd  to  anyone who knows the  United States,  for the United  States would never enter  into any &quot; combination&quot;  in  the  strict sense  of the  word.  anything in  the  nature  of   a  German-American  &quot; rapproachement,&quot;  if  it  is  to come about, will certainly not be prevented by the existence of strained relations betweenGreat Britain and the  United States; on  the other  hand,  such strained relationsWould undoubtedly give it an anti-British  orientation which it need  not otherwise have.                                            -     Good Anglo-American  and good Anglo-French relations  are  not  mutuallydestructive, though there seems a real danger of public opinion in this country believing that they are so if  the present Anglo-American deadlock is allowed to continue.Friendly relations with the United States need in no way interfere  with that close co-operation with France  which is  such  an important asset in European affairs.In  the first place, the natural aloofness of the United States from Europe andtheplay of numerous other factors removes any prospect of Anglo-American relations
ever becoming intimate or &quot;exclusive.&quot;  Secondly, the French need only  fear theimposition of so-called  &apos;&apos; Anglo-Saxon  theories of  disarmament,&apos;5  if, in fact, theyare less devoted to the cause of disarmament than they profess to be.  In the conversecase only a reactionary Anglo-French policy as regards disarmament in general andas regards Germany in particular-or the appearance of such  a policy wouldmilitate against good relations between us and the  United States.    (e.) In the realm of finance good relations with the United States are for thiscountry so valuable as to be almost essential.  The friendly attitude of the Americanbanks  since the war  has  been of great assistance in  the  maintenance of  Britishcredit. A recent  manifestation of this friendly co-operation occurred in connexionwith our return to the gold standard an achievement which would hardly have beenpossible without the aid of the Central Bank.  Furthermore,  a certain amount of friendly co-operation and adjustment between the Bank of England and the federal reserve-Banks in the United States is necessary if fluctuations in the exchange rate on New York and in the British bank rate are to be moderated.  In general, it wouldbe possible for a less friendly attitude on the part of the American banks to embarrassus in a number of ways.  The rivalry in the field of commerce and on the seas existsalso in the field of finance, but hitherto a wise moderation  of outlook and a geniusfor international  co-operation  have  prevented  any serious- feeling of bitterness inthis sphere.   If, however, the general political relations between the two countries,far from showing any signs of improvement,  tend towards further  deterioration,the friendly  attitude of American finance will unquestionably undergo a change.The effect of this state of affairs on the city would be so serious that strong pressuremight be brought to bear on  any  Government in power, with the result that  in thelast resort outstanding political differences might have to be settled on&apos; terms moreonerous for us than those which could have been secured under normal and friendlyauspices.    The financial disabilities under which we are  likely to suffer  should relationsbecome strained  between this  country and the United States would  be  greatlyaggravated by any estrangement between the United States and Europe as a whole.The  continued remittance to  the United  States  of the  huge annual  payments in respect of the  various  w&amp;r  debts is only possible if the flow of new  Americanloans to Europe is not arrested.  Already there is a tendency, owing to local difficultiesin the United States which it is hoped will prove to be temporary only, for Americanbalances in this country to be withdrawn and for the flow of fresh money to europe to diminish.  It is a  tendency which is understood to be causing  some concern toour financiers.  If this process were to be accelerated and confirmed by a progressivedeterioration in the relations between the  United States  and Europe, leading to a reaction in the United States towards financial isolation, a serious situation wouldbe produced.   In  such a case it would be this country which would be the greatestsufferer;  the &quot; tug &quot; would be felt most in London,  which would  be the focus forfurther demands  for credit at  a time when  American balances  and  american co-operation  in  general were  being withdrawn.   The  blame  for  the resultantstringency would be placed upon this country both bv the United States and Europe.It may be urged that  the United States would suffer from such a situation equally with Great Britain.  This is not  the case : whereas the consequences to the UnitedStates would be those which result from a superfluity of riches, the consequences tothis country would be those which result from an excess of poverty a very differentaffair.    (/.) The  United  States  is our best customer so far  as  direct exports  areconcerned, and, with the sole exception of Canada,  we are the  best customer of theUnited States.  The greater the purchasing power of the average American, thegreater will be the number and value of the British goods he is able to buy overthe top of the tariff wall.  This  is  particularly so in the case of the &quot;luxury &quot; trades which contribute largely to our exports to the United States.  While it is true that political relations, unless they become  definitely strained,  have little direct effecton the course of trade, yet it can hardly be doubted that really good relations between two countries must have a certain indirect and psychological influence not  only onthe state of the two markets,  but  also on the banking, shipping and credit facilities which  form such  an important element in modern trade.   The encouragement ofthe American tourist traffic to this country is also a consideration which should notbe entirely overlooked.  A big  movement is shortly to be launched at the MansionHouse for the purpose of co-ordinating and increasing the efforts already being madeto attract American tourists to this country.  Its  success must depend largely  onthe preservation of friendly relations between the two countries.
     (g.) It may be argued that many of the considerations set forth above cut both ways-that the United States Government are equally as interested as His Majesty&apos;s Government in the preservation of good relations between the two countries and that we can accordingly sit back and let them do more of the  work.  This  argument, though attractive at first sight, is only sound up to a certain point.  True, we have much  to offer  the United States, but, in almost every field, the  advantages to be derived from mutual co-operation are greater for us than for them. Politically, with their natural  tendency to isolation  and their  relative remoteness from  European problems, it can hardly be denied that the United States stand to gain less from our friendship than we do from theirs.  Commercially and industrially a slight contrac- tion in our market in the United States would, in view of the unemployment situation here, have more serious results for British trade than a contraction  in America&apos;s market in  this country would have  for  American trade.   Financially,  we  are unquestionably more dependent on the United States than the  United States are upon us.  In the scale of interdependence the balance is tipped in favour of the United States.     Even if the scales balanced more evenly, there is a further point  which merits consideration.   Americans are notoriously hasty and impetuous in their judgments and the actual  advantages which they derive from good relations with Great Britain are patent only to a relatively small and thoughtful minority.   Any United States Government is liable to allow feelings of temporary animosity or disappointment to obscure its considered judgment, and to lose sight in times of  stress of the more solid and permanent  interest of  its own  country.   With our  older traditions and wider experience it should be possible here to take a longer and steadier view of the whole  question; to decide where our  interest lies and what is to be our policy; and then, discounting in  advance  American  peculiarities  in  matters - of  form and procedure, to pursue that policy resolutely.     Such appear to be the more important considerations militating in favour of the maintenance of-good relations with the United States.   If it be admitted that none of them apply  with equal force to any other country, the answer to the question  put above (i.e., what is the value to us of  good relations with the United States ?) is that the maintenance of such relations is of paramount importance.     Let us, however, now examine what are the alternatives to a policy designed to keep Anglo-American relations on the friendliest possible footing. Alternative Policies.     The first is the withdrawal from active co-operation with other nations in  the solution of  such questions as security,  disarmament and reparations.  This would involve a policy of  &quot;go-as-you-please,&quot;  a  co-operation with this or  that  foreign Power to  achieve a  specific end  but  no further  active  promotion  of  agree-ments  by  general international consent.   It  would  also seem  to  involve a reversal of  the policy pursued  since the war and a repudiation of the principles underlying  the Covenant of  the  League, the Washington Treaties and Locarno. Such a  policy  would   do  nothing  to  ease   the situation  with  the  United States, where the Big Navy party would point to a definite collapse of  disarmament as proving the necessity for further construction.   Moreover, the policy of collabora- tion which has been consistently pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in  Europe has  been  attended with  undoubted  success to such an extent that  no  practical alternative has been suggested by even their most vigorous critics.  Difficulties  are now being encountered in the Disarmament  Commission which are arresting  thenatural development of that policy, but no hope of their solution lies in any generalreorientation of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Europe.  This seems to-involve the corollary that we must look elsewhere for a solution, e.g., to  Washington.     The second alternative is the continuation of the existing policy of co-operation with other Powers to the gradual exclusion of the United States.  The justification for such a policy would be that, since the unreasonable and intractable attitude of the United States has had the &quot;effect of stultifying all attempts to secure reasonable settlements, the rest of  the  world -and  particularly Europe: must try  to set itshouse in order  without the co-operation of&apos; America.. In theory, however, the door would  be left&apos;open to the United States to &quot; come  in &quot; at any  time should she so desire/,                  -           &apos;        --.,       .-         &quot;       j      &apos; :    Even in quarters where the importance of good relations is admitted, this policy is  recommended on the ground, amongst  others, that the interest of good relationswith   the   United   States   can  best  be   served  by   leaving   our  various
mutual  problems  unsolved  or  at  all  events  by  making  no  special  effort to  solve  them   on  a  conciliatory  basis,  the  theory  being  that  efforts  atnegotiation only lead to further friction.  Such a theory seems to be opposed to all practical experience.   In the case  of France,  for  instance, it was not until theEgyptian, Moroccan and Newfoundland questions had been settled by the,Treaty of1904 that Anglo-French relations began to improve.  Unsolved questions inevitablyremain as irritants  between nations and become more and more difficult of solutionas time goes on.  This  is believed to be especially  true  between nations one ofwhich is, like the American nation, notoriously excitable, notoriously susceptible tothe demagogic exploitation of controversies with His Majesty&apos;s Government,  and still under the influence of historic memories and prejudices which readily react toanti-British propaganda.    Some advocates of this policy feel that by this means the United States might be either alarmed by the prospect of &quot;compulsory&quot; isolation from European affairs  intoadopting a less intractable policy or alternatively  &apos;&apos; shown up &quot;  as the main obstrue-tion in the way of progress and harmony  and &quot;shamed&quot; into adopting a more generous attitude.  Nobody having any serious knowledge of American politics  and american psychology could believe for a moment that such a policy would have either the one effect or the other.    The success of such a policy depends upon the willingness of five Powers at least Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan: to embark  upon it. Germany&apos;sco-operation would  be essential,   There are, however, many signs that germany has been closely watching the  course of Anglo-American relations and is inspired bythe hope that any further deterioration in those relations may lead to a material  andmost lucrative improvement in German-American relations.  At the  present timeGermany, far from  showing any inclination to follow our lead  (e.g., to adapt theirAmerican policy to  ours),  is taking  the  attitude  that,  as  we are  committeddefinitely  to  France, she  must look elsewhere for  the support which she  stillrequires.  This may be only  a passing pretext, but  the fact remains that Germanyfeels no longer  dependent upon us  as in  the  days of Lord d&apos;Abernon, and isalready counting on America to take our place as  protector.   Nor can she beconsidered unjustified in casting the United States for this role, if the  increasingactivity of the German-American element in the United States and the enormousAmerican investments in Germany are taken into account.  &quot;With Soviet Russiatending towards more moderate courses, the prospect of a close German-Russianentente, backed  by  American money  and goodwill, may not be remote  if Anglo-American relations are permitted to suffer any serious or permanent setback.Application of Policy of &quot; Settlement without America &quot; to Problems under review.    Assuming, however, for the sake of argument that all the Powers  named abovecould be expected to embark  upon a policy of &quot; settlement  without America,&quot; it iswell to examine  how the various  problems under review could be dealt with by theapplication of this policy.    Taking limitation of naval  armament  first, we find  that the Anglo-Frenchcompromise is unacceptable to Italy, and the arrangement about the military-trainedreservists is unacceptable to Germany. These difficulties might have been overcomeif the United States had agreed to support the Anglo-French compromise, but theyquite definitely cannot be overcome as part of an effort to solve the problem indepen-dently of the United States..  Japan also would almost certainly refuse to accept  any arrangement which,  while setting a limit to her  own  powers of construction,  left the United States free to build ad infinitum.    Supposing,  however,  that  some means were found of  overcoming  these difficulties at Geneva, what of the effect in the  United States ?   However carefullyit were explained that our attempt to  reach agreement independently of the UnitedStates  was based On our confidence that no danger  threatened  from the  west, suchaction would be seized on gleefully by the Big Navy party as evidence of  the existenceof a secret political and naval understanding behind the published  terms of  theAnglo-French  compromise.  The  cry  of  a  &quot;united  European front  against.America,&quot;  however unjustifiably raised, is precisely what is  needed  to turn  thepresent determination of  the United States Government  and people to have  a one-Power standard of naval strength  into one for a two-Power standard.   It wouldbe a complete misreading of American national psychology  to  believe that  theAmerican people would not rise as one man to meet any challenge of this description,if it could be made by the Big  Navy party to look like a challenge.
     It is fully recognised that, as a last resort, an attempt may have to be made to conclude a naval limitation agreement independently of the United States.  But the- dangers of such a course are so apparent and the chances of success so slender that every effort to conclude an agreement with the United States should, it is felt, first be exhausted.     Turning now  to the other unsolved problems, it is clear that the principle of &quot; settlement  without America &quot;  cannot  be applied to the question of belligerent rights, since British doctrine on this subject approximates far more  closely to the American than to  the  continental doctrine.   Moreover, this problem  is essentially an Anglo-American and not a European problem, because any serious threat to the exercise by this country of its belligerent rights is likely to come, if at all, from the United States.     The logical application to the arbitration treaty of the policy of &quot;settlement with- out America &quot; would be either to submit a  counter-draft which we know in advance would be unacceptable  to the United States Government or to decide definitely to leave the two countries  without a treaty.  The position  would then be that we should proceed to conclude arbitration treaties  on our model with every other Power of consequence, and the&apos;United States would do the same on the basis  of  her model treaty.  The United States have already concluded&apos; treaties  on the American model with eight countries (including France, Italy and Germany), and are in negotiation with some thirteen  further States.  Alone, the British Empire and the United States would remain without arbitration treaties at  a time when the air is full of the word &quot; arbitration.&quot;  Apart from the question whether the Dominions could be induced to follow us in such a policy, would not the natural comment be: &quot; not only are the British and Americans unable to reach an agreement on naval limitation; not only do  they not dare  discuss belligerent rights;  but  they cannot even conclude an arbitration treaty.&quot;  Such impotence in negotiation could only be justified  by the frank  admission either  that relations with the United &quot;States are already so strained that no further  negotiations on these  points are  possible or  that  a progressive deterioration in those relations  is inevitable and has  been  discounted in advance. There  seems to be ho&apos; justification for either admission  in present circumstances.     Finally,  there  is the question whether  a  solution of the reparations problem is possible without American aid and co-operation in some form or other.  The  only entirely satisfactory solution of the reparations question would involve the reopening of the &quot;debts&quot; question.  Under the most  favourable auspices this is a thorny subject to  open with any United States Government.   Two years ago there was a movement  in the United States weak but  persistent-in favour of a modification of the policy of the  United States Government on this subject.  The recent course of the naval limitation negotiations has definitely closed the door to any reopening of the inter-governmental  debt settlements at the present  time.    The best hope of being able to reopen the &apos;&apos; debts&apos;&apos; question at some later date lies in eliminating  some of the other questions which  divide us.   This can only be effected by giving the American people some tangible proof that we are not trying to isolate them and oppose  the interests of Europe to those of America.. It is in dealing with the reparation problem fatally easy, not to say tempting, to make the  United States Government  the villain of the piece, who is alone preventing an equitable all- round settlement.   It is no doubt very gratifying to place the blame where it belongs, but we should  be labouring under a dangerous fallacy if we  suppose  that by  this kind of denunciation we are going  to force the United States  Government  to cry mea culpa, and to tear up their bond.   It would be improbable enough that we shouldbe ever able  to unite  Europe for this  purpose.   It  is highly  doubtful whether Germany would ever subscribe to such a policy, so that the conclusion might easily bethat we should have all the odium of having  attempted,to promote it without,even the satisfaction of  succeeding, in doing so.   In any case, far  from breaking down the obduracy of the United States Government, it is self-evident that any suspicion, however unjustified,, that a &quot;united European front &quot;  were  being formed  would intensify this obduracy, and what is more, would probably arouse the resentment ofbusiness circles in the United States into the bargain.   The effect of this would be to deprive us of. the co-operation&apos;of the United. States banks if. it comes to trying to mobilise part of German reparations in order to buy France out of the Rhineland. The success,  indeed the  feasibility,  of any  mobilisation of  German  reparations depends on the size of the discount, at whichthe Apierican money market are prepared to take up  the. bonds.        &apos;
    Mr. Parker Gilbert asserts that if with coming negotiations Europe makes a real effort to settle the reparation problem, the United States Government may be counted upon to co-operate  when the time comes to make the settlement effectiveWe need not believe this assurance.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer has definitelysaid that he does not   But our incredulity need not lead us to the other extreme ofbelieving that the only alternative to adopt towards the United States  Governmentis to defy them to do their worst.    The conclusion to be drawn from the preceding paragraphs is that these variousproblems cannot be solved through the application of the policy  &quot; keeping the dooropen for America &quot; and a fortiori of forming a &quot; united front.&quot;  On the contrary,the relations between Great Britain and the United States would soon be  strainedto danger point.Necessity of Firmness in Relations with the  United States.    This brings us back to the more positive policy of  seeking to promote  friendly relations with the United States by the elimination of points of difference between us.    It is fully recognised that, as a general proposition, firmness is  essential in ourrelations with the United States.   An unnecessarily yielding  attitude would notwin American friendship or respect.   Indeed, nothing but good can come of standingto our guns when we have a sound case and  are sure of our ground.   A recent example of this  is afforded by the Standard Oil Company&apos;s claim in respect of thedestruction of their  oil properties in Roumania during the war.   Having a  good case and knowing that the United States Government would not have public opinionbehind them in this matter, His Majesty&apos;s Government steadily refused, in the face of the strongest pressure from the United States Government, either to admit the justice of  the claim or to agree  that it was a proper subject for arbitration.  TheUnited States Government have now to all intents and purposes admitted the Britishthesis by agreeing that the Standard Oil Company must in the first  instance pursue their  remedies against  the Roumanian Government.   In  such  cases as the above,involving no important political  considerations, the utmost firmness is recommended.But in dealing  with matters such as naval limitation, belligerent  rights  and the arbitration treaty, it seems important to weigh carefully the  political  implicationsagainst technical considerations before allowing the latter to stand in the way ofa settlement.  It is by  no means a question of wholesale concession but rather of deciding whether,  in  a  given case, the making of a timely concession  involving a loss does not on balance secure for us permanent political advantages far  outweighingthe sacrifice we are called upon to make.    For the purpose of  solving the urgent problems of naval limitation, arbitration and belligerent rights, no concession is, in fact, recommended which involves  morethan a recognition of the&apos; force of changing circumstances; no concession is recom-mended for which we cannot hope to secure a political  quid pro  quo; no concessionis recommended to-day which will not be inevitable to-morrow.  This is not a policyof weakness, nor does it postulate any lack of firmness in our general relations  withthe United States.   It  is a policy  designed  to  utilise the better elements in theUnited States for the purpose of advancing our own world-wide interests. - .Difficulty of Co-operation with the United States.    It is sometimes contended that such a policy must break down before the  well-known difficulty of &quot; co-operating &quot; with the  United  States Government on any given  question.&apos;  That difficulty is fully admitted  and  is inherent in the AmericanConstitution  and in the American system of government   It does  not however initself seem to constitute any good reason for relaxing our efforts to solve the problems which  at present vex our relations with the United States.   On the contrary, theremoval of those problems is the necessary first step towards better relations, and theestablishment of better  relations constitutes the necessary first step towards fullerco-operation.  British co-operation with the United States can never be easy, but,within limits, it is&apos; far from being impossible.     &apos;  [18364]                  &quot;                                       c
Purpose of Memorandum.     The purpose of this memorandum has been to review some of the advantages tous. of friendly relations with the United States;  to draw attention to the greatdifficulty of solving a number of important problems otherwise than in collaboration with the United States; and to suggest that it is to our ultimate interest to a-rmroachthe settlement of outstanding Anglo-American differences in a spirit, not of  jealousbargaining, but of broad conciliation.     Within the confines of the present memorandum  it  is not  possible to makedetailed suggestions  for  the practical application of this policy to  the problems which have been touched upon.  In general it would seem  to be sufficient if, in ourtreatment of these questions, the paramount importance of good  relations were tobe borne prominently in mind and were, indeed, to be regarded as one of the deciding &apos;factors.  In view,  however, of the urgent importance  of  naval disarmament,  thefollowing more detailed observations on this question, viewed strictly  as  an  Anglo-American problem, are respectfully submitted.     Limitation of Naval Armament viewed as an Anglo-American Problem.Argument that the United States is &quot; Bluffing.&quot;    AN  argument  used in  some quarters against any. concession to the United states on this question is that the United States Government are &quot; bluffing.&quot;   If this phrase isintended to convey the impression that, in the absence of an agreement, the United states will not in fact proceed in her own good time to build a fleet  &quot; second  to  none,&quot; the argument is  entirely fallacious.  It rests  upon an illusion  which it  would  be  mostunsafe for us to preserve any longer.   It is no doubt true that the Big Navy party hasnot yet won over to its extreme doctrines a  half of the American electorate and thatthe majority is still in favour of economy.   But the party is well organised,  active and growing,  and it will stop  at nothing.  Its objective is complete and  unquestionedsupremacy for the American  navy freedom  from even the  fear of  attack,  as mr. Hoover recently said.   The  means to  this end  are  determined opposition to any agreement with this country in regard to cruisers and auxiliary craft and the  generationin the process of  a sufficient amount of friction to  jeopardise  the  renewal of theWashington  Treaty  limiting the  size  and number   of  capital  ships.     All  itsmem bers  are  not  necessarily  anti-British  in other  respects, but  they  will,  intrue American  style, pursue their   campaign  relentlessly  until either  they  have achieved  supremacy or  been beaten by  the - conclusion of  an agreement whichwill   give them  ho  further  scope  for  agitation.    No pious  declarations thatwe do  not  intend  to  compete  with  the  United  States  in  naval  constructionor naval  strength  will have the  slightest  effect  on this  campaign&apos;.   It lives  onmisrepresentation,  and  its  capacity  for  evil  can   only  be  eliminated   by  an anglo-American agreement.   Their bitter antagonism to  an agreement is  due to theknowledge that any understanding which spells &quot; parity &quot; on  paper  spells  inferiorityfor the  United States in  practice,  for, once  an agreement is reached,  the navy department  will  have  the  greatest  difficulty in  securing  from Congress  theappropriations  necessary  for  the  maintenance of  a big  and expensive fleet.  Thiswas certainly the  first  effect of  the  conclusion  of  the  Washington  Naval Treaty of1922,  but it ha,8  since  been counteracted  by the  agitation in regard  to  cruiserconstruction which began in 1925.  As long as the fiction of a foreign menace can bemaintained, a large section  of the community feels bound to support the Big Navyparty for fear of  being dubbed  &quot;un-American&quot; an  epithet of terrible  potency.Remove that fear by the conclusion of a naval agreement and the  movement in favourof a fleet &quot; second to  none &quot; will lose momentum.  There must  be parity on paper,but this does not necessarily involve parity on  the seas, because the United states will almost certainly not &quot; build up &quot;  to the full limits sanctioned by a  treaty.     Much has been made of  the intervention of the Churches and other  pacifically-minded bodies when the seventy-one-ship construction  plan was  under considerationby the. House of Representatives in the early part  of this year.  In actual  practicewhat happened was that, instead  of  demanding the  construction of five  10,000-toncruisers, a year for five  years, the  Bill in  its final form demands five  10,000-toncruisers a,year for three years.  In other words,; the last two years of the programmewere lopped off, but can be easily reattached in three  years&apos; time should the situation
demand it.  As regards  destroyers and  submarines, it was  found tbat authority stillexisted under the 1916 programme for the construction  of a  certain number of thesecraft  and provision  for destroyer construction  was  accordingly  taken  out  of  thepending  Bill.   The  Bill  as  amended was  passed  in  the House  by  237  to  58,despite  the strenuous efforts of the  pacifist  elements.  This does  not  savour  of&quot;bluffing.&quot;  It has also been suggested that the failure of the Senate to pass the bill before it  rose  last  June was due to pacifist  influences and in particular  to  thenegotiations for the Peace  Pact.  This  is  not altogether  accurate.  A number  of measures of major domestic  concern  were before the Senate and, as  often happens,domestic politics were given  pride of place in the short time  available before the endof the session.   The  naval attache reported  at  the  time that there was  opposition tothe building programme from  &quot; a small  minority &quot;  in the Senate.   The State Depart-ment was  disappointed at  the  failure of the bill to  pass as they wished  &quot; to get theNaval Bill and the accompanying naval propaganda out of the way.&quot;  Since then theposition of the Big  Navy party has been greatly  strengthened by the  fate  of  theAnglo-French compromise proposals.   There is reason to believe that such  oppositionto the Naval Bill as there was in the  Senate  last spring will  be still weaker when themeasure comes up in December.Type of Parity  United States would accept.    Another illusion which it would  be dangerous  to preserve  is that  any  UnitedStates Government  would be prepared  or  able to accept  anything less than some form of &quot;mathematical parity.&quot;  If this illusion is  still to prevail, it will be far better not to attempt  any further negotiations with the United States on this subject.  the attempt to substitute some other form of parity for &quot; mathematical parity &quot;  is doomedto failure if only because there is no way  of balancing out such  complex considerationsas length of coast-line, length of communications, and possession of naval bases.  Anysuch attempt would appear to  the American as yet a further British &quot; dodge &quot; to retainsupremacy in practice while yielding it  on  paper.   Americans believe that &quot; parity &quot;was conceded in principle at Washington in 1922 ; they consider that, seeing that theycan afford to lay down five ships to our one, they are making  a  generous concession.when they offer parity.   If present conditions of veiled competition are allowed to hold the field much  longer, they  will  soon demand  that  no agreement be concluded  whichdoes not give them &quot; mathematical superiority.&quot;Illusion that the United States can in no circumstances man the ships.    Yet a third illusion is that the United States cannot man the ships.  The followingquotation  from the annual report for 1927 of the naval attache at Washington is  worthquoting in this connexion: &quot;The year has  been an  exceptionally difficult  one  asregards new recruits, as 20,699 have had to be recruited.  In spite of this, however,no difficulty has been experienced in obtaining the necessary number, and the moral isstill stated to be excellent.&quot;  So long as the fiction of &quot; competition &quot; can be maintained,the men can be secured in good numbers by the simple process of increasing the pay and improving the  conditions of service.  On the  other  hand, once an agreement isreached  with us and Congress relapses into lethargy  on the naval question, the difficultvof securing enhanced  Congressional appropriations for pay and other amenities may become a real one.Possibilities of A gfeement with the  United States  Government.    If the above estimate of  the situation be regarded as substantially  accurate, it follows that the activities of the big-navy party in the United States are unlikely tobe seriously curtailed by any  formal British assurance that we are not building in competition with the United States,  or by the similar assurance of the United StatesGovernment that their  large programme  of  cruiser  construction is required  forpurposes of &quot; rounding out&quot; the navy and bears no relation to the size of any othernavy.  Nor are the underlying suspicions and the deep psychological influences whichflow from a state of real, even though disguised, naval rivalry likely to be removed by such methods.  It is firmly believed that the best hope of eliminating this balefulproblem still lies  in seeking an agreement with the United States Government.    Such a result can only be brought about by both sides agreeing to move slightlyaway  from the.  positions  which they  respectively assumed at the Three-Power
Conference at Geneva.  It may be argued (a) that it is no use attempting anythingfurther with the present Administration, and (&amp;) that in any case the United StatesGovernment are no longer prepared to make any sort of concession.   This may well prove to be the case, but there is at least an equal possibility that the contention isfallacious.   It would not be difficult to discover discreetly the disposition of thepresent Administration if once it were known that His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared to discuss this matter with them on a basis of mutual conciliation.     Constitutionally, there is no  reason why Mr. Coolidge  should  not  conclude a naval agreement  in the last  four months of his Administration,  though he would naturally do nothing against Mr. Hoover&apos;s express  wishes.  Any agreement wouldhave to be  ratified by the next, instead of the present, Senate, but this presents no special difficulty.     It is probably  no  exaggeration  to say that  in  the realm of foreign affairs mr. Coolidge&apos;s most cherished ambition, after his election in 1924, was to complete the work of naval limitation so ably commenced by Mr. Hughes in 1922.  We know that Mr. Coolidge, as Vice-President, took a  keen and sympathetic interest in theproceedings and  conclusions of that  conference, and particularly in its effects on anglo-American  relations.   His disappointment at the Geneva  failure was thegreater, and, hearing only one side of the question, his sense of grievance against his Majesty&apos;s Government was all the keener.  But he may well be reluctant to leaveoffice with the sense of failure upon him so far as this particular project is concerned.This is a factor which should, perhaps, be taken into account.    Mr. Hoover,  on the other hand,  is notoriously difficult to deal with.  His onlypublic utterance  on this subject  (to which  reference was made above)  is that theUnited States must have a navy which removes even the fear of attack.   Whateverhis personal opinions on the merits of this  question,  he will certainly adopt aresolutely &quot; nationalistic &quot; attitude and,  when he assumes  office,  he may well bedisinclined  to  appear  less  unyielding  in  this particular  matter . than was his predecessor.     It would in  any event  seem desirable to  explore the  ground further before deciding that the , chance of an  agreement with the present Administration hasfinally passed away.                                  .                                                   R. L. CRAIGIE.                                            Foreign Office, November 12, 1928.     Since the above was written the  general theme of  this memorandum seems to have received rather striking confirmation from President Coolidge&apos;s armistice day speech.   For the first time a man like Mr. Coolidge, who during his earlier years of  office  steadily  favoured moderation  in  American naval construction, hints at the necessity of the United States having  the largest fleet  in the  world, thus demonstrating the hold which the Big Navy party are obtaining in that country. In another passage Mr. Coolidge says  that  additional efforts on  the part of the United States to  assist in the further progress of Europe (e.g., the settlement of reparations) would be facilitated by (amongst other things) &quot; the further limitation&quot;of  armaments.&quot;  Elsewhere he states:  &quot;We do not wish to finance preparations for a future war.&quot;  He declares definitely, however, that &quot;we want limitation of armaments for the welfare of humanity.&quot;o
