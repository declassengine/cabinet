CABINET.                                     TRADE OUTLOOK.                  Memorandum by  the  President  of  the Board of Trade *                  I  circulate, for the  information  of my  colleagues,             reports which  I have received from members of my Advisory             Council, regarding  the  trade position  and prospects.         b                  The index of production for  the first two quarters of             this  year  shows the following results  -             Taking  1924  as 100  the  index figure  for the  whole  of 1927             was 107.5;   for the first  quarter  of this year 109,1, and             for the second quarter  103,                  The September  export  figures, which have been published             and which  show a serious falling  off,  reflect manufacture in             previous months, which of course, was  bad.    The September             figures also represent  a month in  v;hich there were five             Saturdays  and  five  Sundays.                  The attached report of my Advisory Council shows a             distinct improvement and a more hopeful tone.   It is too             early to say whether this  is more than the natural improvement             expected in  the Autumn.    I am bound also to  add that             improved trade  will not necessarily carry with it a proportion-             ate Improvement in  employment.   Instances are multiplying             in many industries  e.g. coal, steel, marine engineering,             docks,  transport, clothing, where increased efficiency is             giving  a progressively increased output per man employed.                  Coming  to  trades in detail, In coal the  outlook is             brighter.   An  improved demand is reported both for home and             export  which would  appear  to be a little better than the mere             seasonal improvement.   One substantial amalgamation which.            has taken  place in Lancashire will probably lead to others,
and some progress la being made in negotiations between different districts.     In steel generally progress is slow.   In specialsteels where the trade had been very bad, there has been a sudden and marked Improvement,- and Sheffield reports that InSeptember good orders have been received in all trades.   Inthe tlnplate industry, a very satisfactory arrangement hasbeen made with America for sharing export trade.     In shipbuilding, there are a fair number of orders, butth\ey are not up to the level of a year ago and employment will probably be rather worse In the winter.     In engineering, there is a fair amount of work, butprices are bad.   In special lines, good business is reportedIn machine tools, locomotives and tubes.   The motor industry had slumped owing to over-production, but is now Improving.There is no doubt there are too many firms.   Over 70$ ofour total production Is said to be in the hands of three firms.     In non-ferrous metals, trade is distinctly better.     The chemical industry remains good.     The position in the woollen and worsted trades Isdeplorable.   I would particularly draw my colleagues1attention to the report of Mr. Shaw, the trade union leader.Employment has got steadily worse in all branches, and imports have been Increasing.   Some Improvement is hoped forowing to the lower price of wool, but there is not muchevidence of improvement yet.   The only satisfactory featureis the existence of a joint committee of employers andemployed in. the Industry,  o-overlng all branches, and examining the whole position.     The cotton trade throughout  the summer has been as badas ever known.    September &quot;has brought a  distinct  improvement
     In demand, particularly from eastern markets.   There are     large enquiries from India, and Chinese trade is improving     as the fighting season has opened peacefully.   I am glad     to report that the movement for amalgamation in the American     section is proceeding satisfactorily.          In artificial silk, the attempt to cut prices made     trade patchy and uncertain, hut the demand Is now improving     again.   It would appear that artificial silk is more and     more cutting out the natural product.          In presenting this report I cannot forbear to quote     in contrast a letter which I have received from our     Commercial Secretary In Paris,   He summarises the Industrial     position as one of extraordinary prosperity:  after absorbing     into their Industry one and a half million Imported alien     workers, the number In receipt of unemployment relief is     1000 - a situation of which the French might be conveniently     reminded If we have to undertake any discussions on debts     and reparations,                                             Po C-Il*Board of Trade                                              ])     25rd October, 1928.

CONFIDENTIAL.DATE OF NEXT MEETING.     THE PRSSIDBNT reminded the members of the Council thatthe next meeting would be held as usual on the firstWednesday in the month, i.e. 7th November.CONVENTION FOR THE ABO-LIT ION OF IMPORT AND EXPORT         PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.     THE PRESIDENT mentioned that there were two possiblelines to take over this Convention.  It could be ratifiedunconditionally, or conditionally on the accession orratification of any or all of the countries in a specifiedlist.  Under its terms, it could not, in any case, comeinto force until eighteen (or in certain circumstances,seventeen) countries had ratified; therefore the only riskwe should take by ratifying unconditionally was that, if the specified number of other countries agreed to ratify and some important countries were still outstanding, we should be bound until 1936.  We were, however, already boeind by our commercial Treaty with Germany and consequently, bound to allother countries with whom we had most-favoured-natlonTreaties,  That is to say by reason of the German Treaty wewere bound to all those other countries who might not. be boundat all.  It might be that the Germans would denounce that treaty in 1930, and, failing their ratification of theConvention, they would then be able to impose prohibitionsagainst us.  In his view, however, and in that of Sir SydneyChapman, who had been carrying out the work at Geneva, itwould be good business for us to ratify the Convention un-conditionally.  we could not at any rate be bound by it until seventeen nations had come in, but we should be giving a lead to the other countries not to make their obligationsconditional.  Therefore he was proposing to advise theCabinet, after putting both Issues before them, that an early and unconditional ratification would be all to the good.     Unconditional ratification did not, of course, implythe giving up of our reservations contained in the text ofthe Convention.  It would not alter the text at all.  As faras ooal was concerned, that was one of Germany&apos;s reservationsin the Convention, but when she came to terms with Poland, itwas quite possible that Bhe might lift the prohibition on coal, despite her reservation.     The Council agreed with the recommendation the Presidentproposed to make.COAL.     MR. WARHAM was glad to say that the general outlook inthe coal trade was Blightly brighter than when the Councillast met, although the weekly output for the United kingdom for the four weeks ending September 22nd varied only from,400,000 to 4,700*000 tons.  This was considerably belowthe five million mark, yet the figures showed a distinct
CONFIDENTIAL.COAL (OONTD.).improvement on the previous month or two   The output forthe week: ended September 15th was eighty-seven per cent.of the March 1925 weekly average basis.  The quantityexported from the United Kingdom in August was a little overfour and a quarter million tons as compared with 4,100,000tons in July,  The value- was a trifle down, 15,/ed, inAugust as compared with 15/7d, in July..  The latest figuresdid show an improving demand for coal both for home and export,  It might, of course, be partly accounted for bythe seasonal summer trade in the Midlands and the approach of colder weather, but it was said that the position&quot;of thecoal trade in Poland was an over-sold one and it was quite certain that coal was being bought from thiB country toreplace coal which had been bought from Poland and whichPoland had been unable to deliver.  On the other handPoland was buying material, particularly wagons, to increase her exporting capacity and it was understood she was sellinglarge quantities of her best coal at ll/3d. and ll/6d. perton f,o.b, for next year.  Of course this was quite beyond any competitive power of ours.  It was difficult to say how far the increased activity on the North East coastwas due to the restriction of output in the various districts of this country, but it did seem likely that thedemand for coal from Northern Europe would not be so badduring the coming winter.  Unfortuntaley, the old summertrade to the Baltic had now been captured by Poland and itmight again be difficult to keep exporting pits employedduring next summer.     The exports from Poland by sea continued to increase and in August they amounted to 661,000 tone.  That was the biggest they had yet been,  Germany was rather reducing itsamount of free exports and reparation exports.  In March1926, the oombined figure was 2,151,000 tons; for bothJuly and August of this year it was 1,800,000,  There was abetter demand coming to us now for shipment to Germanyand the licences  appeared to be given with a little morefreedom.  Several of our merchants, who had previouslyhad  difficulty about licences, were now putting on boatsagainst their contracts.     The monthly  exports of coal from Great Britain to scandinavia were  still low, but in August they Improvedslightly.  They came down from a monthly average of825&quot;,000 tons  in 1913 to 352,000 tons in July this year, but had gone up  to 416,000 tons in August.  The exports toGermany, for  July and August, were near  the half million tons mark, which  was a considerable improvement.    In the conversations that were now going on between france and Germany about the evacuation  of the Rhineland, it seemed  likely  that the whole question of reparationswould  have to  be  considered afresh.   In  the arrangementsmade  under the Peace Treaty we had been  able to obtaincertain  safeguards for the British coal  trade, but underthe uawes  Scheme  these safeguards went by  the Board.Mr, Warham considered there could be  no  doubt that thojjawes  Scheme  had  done enormous damage  to the coal trade of this  country and  had consolidated the  German trade to a
COAL (CONTD,)remarkable extent.  The Government could, in his opinion,do a very great service to the coal trade of this country by seizing any possible opportunity of improving ourposition during the discussions on the evacuation ofGerman territory.  He could see that there were difficulties, but we had aeon the very disastrous effect the reparation arrangements had had in regard to our coal trade with Italy.  She was endeavouring to increase herimport of German coal on account of reparations to ourdetriment.     THE PRESIDED stated that, after very carefulconsideration of this matter, he had no doubt at all thatany attempt to re-open the reparation question apart fromthe debt question, would put this country in a position from which the coal trade would not benefit, but other interests would be asked for sacrifices.  He was sure weshould have to stand very firm on that.     load GAINEORD reported very little improvement inprices.  In ooke there had boon an improvement generally,owing, he thought, to a bigger demand for coke for export.The furnace trade was vory slack and that had had a depressing effect upon prices.  There was generally speakinga stronger feeling and a much better tone than there hadbeen for the last three or four months.  It might bepartly due to the selling arrangements which were nowunder discussion, but he was quite sure it was partly dueto the anticipation of the help they would get in therelief of railway rates from the 1st December.  That wvas anenoouraging feature and the prospect for next year was really brighter than it had been for some months.IRON AND STEEL.     MR, BOND thought that the current issue of the &quot;ironand Coal Trades Review&quot; accurately summarised the presentposition of the iron and steel trades when It stated -*the seasonal expansion in the demand for British iron ard&quot;steel products is disappointingly slow in coming to&quot;maturity&quot;.  With regard to pig iron  the best that couldbe said was that prices remained firm and that currentoutput was being absorbed; in faot, in some cases, stockswer6 being reduced.  Demand had not, however, Inoreasedsufficiently to warrant the blowing in of extra furnaces andalthough, so far as present reports went, three additionalfurnaces had been blown in during September three othershad been blown out.  They seemed to have the same conditions in pig iron in the United States and it was evident that the production of steel scrap had largely increased owing to the fact that there was more wastagein the production of steel, more steel being cut off andgoing back into the furriaoes.
CONFIDENTIAL.IRON AND STEEL (COOTP.)     Imports of pig iron had been reduced to negligibleproportions, but on the other hand, exports had not increased.So far as figures were available for steel production itwould seem that the September output showed the normalseasonal increase over August, which was, of course, affectedby the holidays, but the September output would be less thanthat in September last year.   The activity on the Continenthad led to rather more buying of British seinl-finishedmaterial, but purchases of finished steel were in the mainstill on a hand-to-mouth basis.  Few long-dated contracts  hadbeen placed in the heavy steel trades,  and rolling mills were working far below capacity.  Perhaps the position was slightlybetter than in recent months and many trade reports spoke  of abetter feeling.   There was, however, so far little justification for this in actual orders placed.  The  position of the british iron and steel trade was still In marked contrast to theposition on the Continent, where activity was general,  with therecent increases in prices well sustained.  In the sheet tradedemand and general conditions were better than they had beentwo months ago and the works were fairly well employed.     The tinplate industry w&amp;3 working  75 per cent. of.capacity;  prices were steady and demand was sufficient  to absorb the output of mills on this basis.  After prolongednegotiations an arrangement had been made between tinplatemanufacturers in Wales and tinplate manufacturers in the UnitedStates, under which the two countries agreed to stabilise  theirproportion of exports on the basis of 70 per cent,  for theUnited Kingdom and 30 per cent, for the United States of the combined exports of the two countries.   It was a very satisfactory agreement.  There was no price arrangementattached to it.  The production of tin  plates in the UnitedStates was about 1,800,000 tons a year  and about 1,600,000tons of that was consumed at home.  They obtained for thathome consumption, owing to their protected markets&apos;, about 2 more than the-price we got in the open market,  so they  had alarge profit to devote to exploiting the export trade.   Beforethe war the combined exports of the two countries had been inthe neighbourhood o  550,000 tons; today it was about 725,000,but bur exports were now no larger than they had seen beforethe war.  Under the new arrangement we  should get 70 per cent.of any increase in demand for exports and they only 30 per cent.During the year of the coal strike the  United States hadexported 40 per cent, of the expoz^ts of tne two countries  and *last year they had exported 35 per cent, of the exports  of thetwo countries,  so the arrangement was  a satisfactory one  from.our point of view.  The Americans had naturally wanted to  makea price agreement, but it was pointed out to them that such anagreement would have the danger of encouraging production  onthe Continent of Europe and the proposal was dropped.  british manufacturers had raised the price of tin plates by about   1 aton since last year and had turned an industry which was working at a loss into an industry which, in the efficient works,  was working at a profit,  The arrangement was for a period of  threeyears;&quot; all manufacturers of tin plates in the United states had signed it and practically all the tin plate manufacturers of this country.
9 iron AND STEEL (CONTD.).     MR. PUGH wrote J-     &quot;The holiday season being over, there was a feeling ofsome optimism throughout the Trade at the beginning of themonth.  The firmness of Continental prices has reflecteditself upon British trade, and in the case of some commoditiesthere is no longer any foreign competition to consider.  Onthe whole, it may be said that the month has shown a general improvement.     &quot;In the pig iron trade, a few more blast furnaces havere-commenced operations, and it is understood that moreinquiries have been received from abroad and some good salesconducted.  Makers of semi-finished steel are engaged on anumber of orders, of which 30ft steel billets appear to beprevalent.  In finished iron and steel there is a betterdemand, while the securing of an order for 47,000 tons ofrails for South Africa by a North-east Coast firm has contri-buted to an improvement in the position in that district.Plate mills, however, are working slack.     &quot;There has been no material change in the position of thetinplate trade, which is inclined to be quiet, althoughsufficient orders are on hand to carry them along.  The mostinteresting development is the arrangement between South wales and American producers for limiting competition between thetwo countries in foreign markets.  Better business isreported in the galvanised sheet trade, and is indicated by an upward tendency in prices.  It is reported that good trade isbeing done with South America, South Africa and India.&quot;STEEL.     SIR ARTHUR B ALP OUR stated that the summer months, June,July and August, had been the worst they had had in Sheffieldsince August, 1920, and he would be surprised if the exportfigures were not down for September, because their turnoversin Sheffield were all down for that month.  It had been themost disastrous month they had had for a long time.  As an illustration of what had been going on in the home trade,  inhis own concern, he had had 1,150 more orders this year than last year and yet he was several thousand pounds down inturnover, owing to the smallness of the orders.     While, ho?/ever, the orders durinb the summer were insufficient to fill up the September export trade, those that came in in September were much larger,  and he hoped thatthe October exports would be at least equal to those ofOctober last year.  The orders came rather late, but theprospects for all the Sheffield trades were quite good for october and certainly for November.  If orders continued tocome in a3 in September, the exports for the last threemonths of the year should be quite satisfactory.
STJ2BL (CONTD.).     The improvement in September, too, was more than thenatural increase to be expected, after the holidays.  Theorders had been of a very much better class.  ?/hen peoplereally wanted goods they cabled for them and he had had morecable orders during the last three weeks than during theprevious six months.  Nor had the recent improvement beenbrought about by price reductions.  They had had a ratherdisastrous experience in the reduction of prices earlier inthe year.  They had then gone on the theory that they should reduce prices and take the risk of getting more business.They had cut prices, but they did not get the business and had lost large profits.     In Sir Arthur&apos;s opinion the great difficulty in Sheffieldwas that cost of production was higher than the world&apos;s costof production.  We were really maintaining our trade in theexport markets today merely by the strength of our sellingorganisation, our reputation and our trademarks.  Our costs ofproduction did not compete with those of the Czecho-Slovakians,the Austrians, the Germans and the French, who were now makingthe same class of goods as we were in Sheffield.  We were trying all kinds of new methods of milling etc. in order tobring our costs down, but we had a considerable distance to go before we could feel sure of our position.  This applied evenin the special steels, and very distinctly in things such asfiles, saws, drills and milling.cutters.     There had been several more failures in Sheffield sincethe last meeting of the Council.  In these cases receivershad been put in; the firms had not liquidated but still hungon cutting prices.  Thi3 policy resulted in pulling the efficient people down for the inefficient.      In China, in spite of all the troubles there, Sheffieldwas managing to do a fair trade and get paid for it.  In Japanwe were gaining ground and getting back a good deal of thetrade we had lost when they started to manufacture steelthemselves.  The Japanese had, however, given up manufacturingbecause they had found they could not make so satisfactory aquality.  Our trade in Australia was unsatisfactory, competi-tion was keen and orders small.  The prospects were not good and the present dock strike  would not help us.  Canada wasa bright spot.  We were beating the Americans on their ownground and doing a very good trade there.  South America wasalso satisfactory.     Certain Czecho-Slovakian and Austrian steelmakers were putting down stocks all over the world and offering to putsteel into manufacturers&apos; own works to use from as they likedand debit every month.  This, Sir Arthur thought,  was a very dangerous form of competition.  It was a kind of business hewould not do, because, in the long run, it would mean failure.The steelmaker would get left with stock that had gone out of date because of ohange in methods.
CONFIDENTIAL.NON-FERROUS METALS.     SIR CECIL BUDD wrote:-     &quot;As regards conditions in the metal trade, I am glad to be able to report that there has been some improvementduring the past two months, and that this has been fairlygeneral.  The brass and copper manufacturers appear tohave received good orders, and in particular the cablemaking industry continues very well employed.  The tinplatemills remain satisfactorily busy, and the galvanised ironmakers fairly so&quot;.ENGINEERING.     MR. BROWNLIE observed that the general state of theengineering industry might be summarised as follows.  the electrical industry had been fairly good from January to august and fair in August.  Railway engineering was fairin January, fairly good thereafter, but rather bad inAugust.  The motor and cycle industry was very good at thebeginning of the year, hut had been bad in August; ofcourse that was to be expected.  Shipbuilding and the marine engineering section had been bad the whole way through.   The textile section was bad for the monthsof January, May and June and was fairly moderate for the months of July and August.  General engineering was onlymoderate.     With regard to employment the figures given in theMinistry of Labour Gazette showed the percentageunemployment  in the engineering industry for the monthof August this year-to be 10.4, whereas for the sameperiod the figure of the Amalgamated Engineering Union was6.85.   The Union&apos;s latest figure, for the month ofSeptember, was 7.36.     MR. RICHMOND stated that in marine engineering,business could only be described as patchy.  A  numberof establishments were only indifferently employed atthe moment, while a few were comparatively busy.Unemployment figures tended to show an increase in nearly all districts.  The disparity between home and foreignprices for ships and engines was becoming markedly less,and of the orders obtained by the North East coast withinrecent months, two-thirds were for foreign owners, whichwas a welcome indication of this tendency.  On the Clyde,the output still continued high.  During September therewere launched 13 vessels of 69,630 tons, making a total for the nine months of 160 vessels of 485,833 tone, whichwas the third highest output for the same period in thelast ten years.  The record for the period was made in1920, when 166 vessels totalling 489,4:35 tons were launched,so that this last nine months was only slightly below the record period of nine months.  One would have expected
ENGINEERING- ( CONTD. ) .that unemployment figures during this busy period wouldhave been at a minimum, but on the contrary there had been quite continuous unemployment.  This was somewhat difficultto account for, but among the reasons advanoed were theabsenoe of disputes and broken time, and increased efficiency and facilities now in existence which had enabled more work to be turned out by fewer men.  in comparison with pre-war figures, it had also to be rememberedthat the tonnage of the last nine months was almost entirelymerchant tonnage, whereas formerly a large part was Navalwork with a much greater proportion of labour per ton.Unfortunately the inflow of new orders was not by any meanssufficient to maintain the high level of the last nine months, and it would appear that the curve of new work haddefinitely taken a downward turn.  During the past monthno orders of any importance had been placed.     Incidentally Belfast had secured some good work recentlyand there was some dissatisfaction at the continuance ofthe North of Ireland Government guarantees, which naturallyworked to the disadvantage of English and Scots builders.Enquiries were still fairly numerous and some importantorders were almost due to be placed, but there was the usualconflict of opinion as to the outlook.  It was almost certainthat the winter would see an increase in unemployment, but inspite of this there were not wanting indications of an &apos;improved feeling and of a more hopeful atmosphere.     In Scotland generally there were some encouraging signs.Machine tool makers were experiencing a certain livelinessand, although competition in the locomotive trade was verykeen, a gratifying amount of work was in hand.  Tube makers-fere busy and constructional engineers were fairly employed.     THE PRESIDENT inquired as to the lapse of time betweenthe passing of plans and the placing of orders.  He understoodthat the last figures of Lloyds as to plans passed were quitegood.     MR. RICHMOND thought that there would be a lag of about two to three months.  Nowadays from the time a plan waspassed the work proceeded very rapidly, but it depended onthe class of vessel, the lag for ordinary merchant tonnagebeing only slight.     SIR ERNEST PETTER wrote:-    &quot;There occurred during the month of August a partialarrest of the steady upward movement of unemployment since march last.    The subsequent    weekly totals published inthe press have shewn a relatively stationaryposition,  which  together  with  more  cheering  reportsgenerally  from  the  principal  industrial,  centres,
CONFIDENTIAL.ENGIMKSRING (C ONTD. )inspires the hope that the normal seasonal autumn revival, whichis eagerly anticipated, may be realised.  Curiously enough,while - unemployment in the other heavy industries declinedslightly during August, the percentage of workless insuredworkers in engineering industry rose perceptibly from 9.5ato 10.4$; the largest increase occurred in constructionalengineering, and the smallest, it is Interesting to discover,in marine engineering.     &quot;Seasonal factors have caused a revived demand for coal,the outputs and exports of which show a slight increase,  Ironand steel output continues to decline, and the imports of ironand steel have again increased,  August, however, was a goodexport month in iron and steel, and very fair as regardsmachinery exports, which amounted to 45,172 tons.  This gives a total for the eight completed months of 385,712 tons, whichis fully 84:% of 1913 rate, and l4Ji better than the previouspost-war record (1925) at this stage of the year.  There was an increased Import tonnage of machinery in August, at a somewhat higher average value per ton than in July,     &quot;An analysis of the reports and balance sheets of engineering and allied firms for the financial year 1927, ascorn-pared with previous years, recently published by the BritishEngineers Association indicates that the aggregate results for1927 show a marked recovery from the deplorable consequences of1926 as reflected in the balance sheets of companies coveringthat period.  Thus we find that earned profits, expressed as aratio to paid-up capital, have increased from 2.8$ in 1926,to 4C3% in 1927o  Similarly, while the debenture burden hascontinued to increase, the amount distributed in ordinary andpreference dividends has risen from 3.9/i to 4,2% of paid-upcapital; and for 1927, in consequence, dividends paid havefallen just within the amount of earned profits, instead ofexceeding it by nearly 50;i&apos; as was the case in 1926,  However,the continued and cumulative drain imposed on reserve funds in recent years, in order to make and maintain dividendpayments, is evidenced in the further relative decline of thetotal amount carried forward,&quot;ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR PHILIP NASH wrote:-     &quot;There is really no change in the electrical industrial position since August&quot;.COT T OS     SIR KENNETH STEWART stated that in the cotton trade the summer months up to the middle of September had been veryquiet and about as bad as they had ever been.  In the home trade the position was still gloomy, but in regard to Europe,South America and Australia, though matters were stillquiet, there was a distinctly better under-tone.  In the caseof the Eastern markets the summer months had again been bad,but ever since the middle of September there had been a remarkable improvement; manufacturers had received heavy
OPTO OK. (contd..)demands for quotations and a fair amount of business had gonethrough.  This improvement appeared likely to continue.A special reason for this probability of continuing lay Inthe fact that last year prices of raw cotton were high inSeptember and the market was falling, whereas this yearprices were low in September and had since been steadilyrising.  This was a very encouraging feature from thepoint of view of the foreign merchant.  India was our mostImportant market and this large demand, or rather largeenquiry, was coming chiefly from India.  China was more encouraging than usual in view of the prospect of peace there.     Generally speaking, the outlook was distinctly more encouraging.  Recent quotations seemed to show that theposition of the manufacturers was improving.  There was still a great deal of discussion going on in regard toamalgamations in the cooton trade and opinion seemed to be definitely crystallising in a favourable direction inLancashire itself.     MR. LEE thought that, from the point of view of productionthere was no change in the situation since the last meeting of the Council.  The Egyptian section was stillworking a considerable amount of unofficial short timeand was accumulating considerable stocks In the spinningsection, but there was some improvement in the generalprospects.  In the Egyptian section, for instance, from august and September onwards, both the spinners and the manufacturers had probably sold their production and,though prices had been bad, it was necessary to getmachinery properly going as a preliminary to gettingprices which showed a profit, and from that point of view in that section the prospects were decidedly more favour-able.  In the coarse section the position was certainlyno worse.  The improved prospects in the Indian and chinese markets, mentioned by Sir Kenneth Stewart, werereflected in the orders that were coming forward to manufacturers.  Another Important point was the approachingstabilisation of the price of the raw material.  Theindustry was clear at the moment, and likely to remainclear, of labour disputes.  The Presidential election inAmerica and the Gener-al election in England next year would, however, probably affect Lancashire trade adversely.WOOL.     MR.  AYKRCYD stated that since the last meeting of  theCouncil they had experienced one of the quietest periods on record, and business had been almost at a standstill untilthe last three weeks or so.   The London sales which
WOOL. (CONTD.)opened towards the end of September had revealed a very-weak position in the wool markets and prices fellconsiderably in both merinos and crosebreds.  During theperiod when wool was selling in the Overseas markets,prices had been gradually forced up by world competitionto a level that the trade would not follow, and before the markets were closed business had stopped here and buyershad been compeiled^o carry the weight of responsibilitythemselves.  From faster to the middle of September therehad been an entire absence of any new business.  At theLondon sales which had just terminated, 40,000 bales were announced more than the- quantities expected and this was partly the reason of the collapse.  Stocks which had beenheld very firmly for the last four months had now beenlet loose on the market and there appeared to be an entirelack of confidence and a good deal of uncertaintyprevailing throughout the Industry.  But here and there,there were si gas of more business coming on account of thevery much reduced prices.  In addition to this it waspossible that England would have a stronger position and bea greater factor than for some years in deciding prices at the coming sales In Australia, owing to the disturbances in Germany and in France.  It would be very much to theadvantage of this country if a big advance in wages tookplace on the Continent.     In the wool combing industry the machinery runningwas approximately the same, with a pad outlook for the winter months.  In worsted spinning there was no improvement toreport; all orders coming to hand were extremely small and made it difficult to get a reasonable turnover.  There was no increase in output since July and short time had increasedslightly in all sections of the trade, carpet yarn spinnersbeing the best off.  The woollen and worsted manufacturersreported an increase in short time.  The average was not morethan thirty hours per week per loom, and trade&quot;in this sectionhad gradually got worse and was reported now to be worse thanat any time during the last four years.  At this time of theyear, work for the new season should be commencing, so it waspossible that a little more business might be done in the nextfew weeks.  There were quite a large number of manufacturerswhose business was wholly In the home trade and who were completely closed down.     In the Keighley area the coating trade was holding itsown well in high class goods for the South American market.This could not be said of the dress trade which was in a very bad condition in the face of foreign competition.   The spinnersin this district, like those in Bradford, had not more than60 to 70 per cent, of the machinery running.  In Yeadon andGuiseley a fortnight previously there had been rather moreorders, but these had been v/worked up and business was as quietas at any time during the last six months.  The depressionwas general, all firms suffering alike.
GONFIpSKTIAL.WOOL (CONTD.).     Mr, Aykroyd thought that, generally speaking, theprospects for the future wej^e not without hope.  Thereduction of price, which had been very considerable, andthe prospect of higher wages on the Continent increasing their costs, would both assist our manufacturers andspinners very materially for the coming season.  There wasa prospect of large supplies of raw material from everycentre, from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa andSouth America.     MR, ARTHUR SHAW agreed with Mr. Aykroyd that theinstability cf wool prices was one of the most disturbingthings in the trade and was undoubtedly creating unemploy-ment today.  He thought the position had never been worse thanit was at the present time in Yorkshire.,  Very often it waspossible to report that trade was good in one district and bad in another, but since July throughout the whole ofYorkshire the position had gradually got worse, and indeedhe doubted if there were any real signs of improvementduring the last two or three weeks.     With regard to employment, in the Bradford district,where the figure on 4th July was 12.88%, the percentage ofunemployment, calculated on the.trade union returns, hadgradually increased until the 26th September, when it was26.43^.  The average for the month of September was 25.47^,as against 9.16$ during the same month last year.  In theheavy woollen district the position was similarj theaverage for the month was 22.98$ as against 13.42$ lastyear.  The worst feature was in the Huddersfield districtwhere the disturbing amount of unemployment which he had reported in May had since been maintained.  The figures inthat district for September showed an average of 22$signing the union books as against 9,34% in September  lastyear. ^The percentage unemployment for Yorkshire as awhole for the month of September was 23.67 as against10.42 in September 1927.     The retained Imports of woollen and worsted tissuesfor the first eight months of this year showed an increaseof 3.3 million  square yards, or 14$, over the correspondingeight months of 1927.  The increase had been steadilygoing on since  1923, when our retained  imports were 21million square  yards as against 35.6 million square yards in1927, or an  increase of 70 per cent.  It seemed probablethat  by the  end of this year the importB would reach about40 million square yards, or about twice  the quantity thatcame  in in 1923.      In order to  explore the situation  thoroughly aoommittee had been set up embracing  all sections of theindustry, with  Mr. George Douglas, representing the dyers,as Chairman.  No  question was ruled  out of consideration,though  the committee was confining itself at the moment to the  position of the home trade.
C ONFI DSNTIAL.ARTIFICIAL SILK.     MR. AKDISON mentioned that the artificial silk market hadbeen violently disturbed in the usually quiet month of Augustby a well known firm making a big price reduction.  Buyers hadbeen scared and, from the end of August up to the end ofSeptember, trade had been marking time.  There was still a gooddemand for high grade yarns in Yorkshire, but this feeling of unrest had rather stimulated the makers of lower grade yarns to push their goods into the market and accept practically anyprice they could get.     As regards Leicester the market had been quiet, but wasbeginning to show distinct signs of improvement.   In Nottinghamthe lace and knitting trade still continued quite good.  Leedsand Macelesfield were still in the quiet state they had been infor a long time past.  In the Overseas markets there wascomparatively speaking not a large export trade to the Continentbecause Continental producers were able to meet their own requirements.  The Australian market was still good in spite ofthe labour troubles there, but credit had to be watchedclosely.  In India there was practically no business,  but it was hoped,  now the Bombay strike was over,  that trade would begin to flow again.   In the Argentine there had been a big slump inthe stocking trade and he was informed that manufacturers therewere trying to organise short time running about three days aweek.   In Brazil,  on the other hand,  trade was distinctly good.The cotton weaving concerns there were now largely changing overto artificial silk and there was a steady demand.     As regards prospects generally,,Mr. Addison thought thatbuyers would get over the scare about the drop in pric es andthat an early resumption of business would come about.CHEMICALS.     MR. HILL observed that the chemical industry during thepast two months had been very quiet in the home trade, butthere was some indication of improvement.  The export figuresfor August compared with July showed an increase of three percent, in value, and were forty per cent, and twenty per cent.higher respectively than those for August 1926,and 1927.Exports of ammonium sulphate during August had shown an increase over July and the export figures for the chemical trade as awhole for the first eight months of this year, compared withthe corresponding periods of 1926 and 1927, showed a percentage increase in value of about thirteen per cent, in eacii case.  . Asregards imports the Augusc figures were thirteen per cent.higher than the July figures and sixteen per cent, higher thanthose- for August last year.  They showed only a slignt increase over 1926 figures, however.  Taking the first eight months of1928 the imports were slightly less than in the correspondingperiod of 1927 and were two per cent- higher than in 1926.
CHEMICALS (CONTD.).     With regard to the sulphuric acid industry theamount of acid manufactured during the first half of1928 was 457,000 tons calculated as 100 per cent, acid.That was probably about the maximum during the pastseven years.  The percentage of plant capacity in useduring the period amounted to 66.4 which was a fraction of one per cent, higher than any figurerecorded since 1920.   In regard to the raw materialsused to produce this acid, the figures showed some slight changes due to increased production from zincconcentrates and to decreased imports of brimstone.They were as follows:  44-ji per cent, of the acid was made from pyrites                    (chiefly imported from Spain).  26-g- per cent, of the acid was made from spent oxide                    (home produced).  19  per cent, of the acid was made from brimstone                    (Sicily).   9  per cent, of the acid was made from zinc                    concentrates (Australian).   1  per cent, of the acid was made from coal brasses                    (home produced).     It would be observed that only 27-g- per cent, ofthe raw material was British produced, the balancebeing imported chiefly from Spain and Sicily.  Also9 per cent, of the total acid was now made compulsorilyin the manufacture of spelter, whereas seven yearsago only about 0.5 per cent, was produced in this way.As the whole of this &apos;spelter acid&apos; was sold on themarket and none consumed by the manufacturers in theirown processes, it was probably accurate to say that from one-sixth to one-fifth of the acid now sold wasproduced compulsorily in the manufacture of spelter.As this manufacture was almost a new industry in theUnited Kingdom, it was evident that the sulphuric acidindustry was faced with a difficult problem in being called upon to- absorb these large additional amounts ofacid on an already depressed market.     The quantity of superphosphate manufactured in the United Kingdom including the Irish Free Stateduring the twelve months ended 30th June, 1928, was496,000 tons, showing a decrease of 8,600 tons compared with the previous period of twelve months.The sales of British made superphosphate were 510,000tons compared with 485,000 tons for the previous year and 532,000 tons for the year ended June 1926.Imports of superphosphate of foreign manufactureduring the year under review amounted to 161,000tons compared with 201,000 tons for the previous year.
ft) iC ONPI DJJNTIAL.CHEMICALS (COITTD).Prom these figures it appeared that the total agriculturaldemand for the year ended June 30th, 1928, was 671,000  tons compared with 686,000 tons for the preceding year, a decreaseof 2-1 per cent.   Oirer-production and disorganisation of  theFrench superphosphate industry resulted in supplies being offered at low prices during the early spring, so  if theBritish Industry, on the figures quoted, may be said to have held its own in comparison with previous years it had onlydone so at a heavy sacrifice.RUBBER .     MR. JOHNSTON wrote:-     &quot;The position of the rubber manufacturing  industry con-tinues on the whole tobe satisfactory. The upset  caused by  the  suddenfall in prices following the announcement of  the abandonment  of restriction has now been to a great extent got  over without any,undue disturbance of values.  There have been considerable falls in prices  in the tyre  section of the Industry, but this  isprobably more due to the efforts of some of the newly  establishedfactories of foreign concerns to secure a larger share of  thebusiness than to the crude rubber situation.  Production,however, continues to be fairly satisfactory  although  the  present level of prices is scarcely remunerative.  In the footwearsection of the industry business has continued  in a very  satis -factory condition through the Summer months and there  is everyindication that factories will be working to  capacity  during  theAutumn and Winter months.  The tendency indeed  Is for  the demand to exceed the supply and at prices which are  fairly satisfactory and notwithstanding very considerable foreign competition  inthis section the position general ly is reasonable and  prices arebeing maintained.  In the general rubber goods  section business on the whole is satisfactory although certain sections complainof lack of orders.  It  is considered, however,  that taking onearticle with another there is, on the ?/hole,  a  satisfactorytendency in this class  of goods.     &quot;Export trade to the Continent generally speaking showssteady improvement, but to the East, Australia and the british dominions generally, exports have been very disappointing forseveral months past.  Employment is above the average  and  incertain sections such as rubber footwear overtime is beingworked.  On the whole,  therefore, the situation in the industry may be regarded as quite satisfactory and progressive.&quot;GAS INDUSTRY.     SIR DAVID MILNE-WATSON reported that there had been afurther considerable drop in the value of pitch since the endof July.    The decrease in value had been brought ab*utalmost entirely by the  fact  that  the  Germans  had  a
a aCONFIDENT!AL.                    Or AS INDUSTRY (CONTD.).larger quantity of pitch to export owing to the Increasedquantity of tar produced in Germany.  This increased tarproduction in Germany was also affecting creosote, whichhad fallen in value by about 13-g- per cent.  In regard totar, which was one of the most important by-products,the past season haa been very good from the point of viewof road work, large quantities having been used for thatpurpose.  Though no official figures were available atthe present time, it was estimated that there had been aconsiderable increase in the. quantity of tar used on roads last season over the previous season, and the drop in price which had taken place would enable the Industrybetter to compete with imported American bitumen.  Inregard to sulphate of ammonia, the price was now at avery low level, about thirty per cent below pre-war;the demand was good from abroad and recently there hadbeen large purchases from Ireland.GENERAL TRADE.     LORD GAINPORD   stated that the Federation of 3ritlshIndustries had very little definite data to enable themto say that there had been any Important industrial change.Reports from the industrial districts were more cheerful,though to what extent this represented a general revivalor merely a recovery after the holiday season it was difficult to say.  The iron and steel works were findingContinental competition a little less.  There was asubstantial amount of business going on in the engineering industry generally, although prioes were not remunerative.The president of the Machine Tool Trades&apos; Association had recently stated that the order books in that branoh were now better filled than they had been since 1920.  In the electrical industry, a number of important orders had beenreceived during September, principally from empire countries.  In non-ferrous metalB there was a better feeling in the market and prices of standard copper had continued their upward movement.   In cotton an improved buyingmovement for India was anticipated, but there had been a fall In raw cotton prices.  Business had generally atendency to expand.  Spinners in the American yarn sectionhad been recommended to close their mills for a fortnightowing to the shortage of orders.  Woollen prices were nowsome five or ten per cent, below those recorded in July.In boots and shoes the outlook was uncertain; activitieshad revived slightly since the holidays.  Pottery was newvery reassuring.  In chemicals, the foreign trade wasdistinctly better and exports in August rose three per cent.as compared with July and t?;enty per cent, as compared with august last year.  Hosiery was normal for the time of year,knitted garments and silk and artificial silk hose beingmostly in demand.     SIR GILBERT VYLE observed that many trades were doingfairly well and a good many interesting new orders and new business had come in.  He had just returned from a visit
9 QGOITi&apos;&apos;ID iITTIAL*GENERAL TRADE (COIiTD) .to Germany and had found the general trade conditions thereundoubtedly worse than last year.  On the other hand,the generalappearance and behaviour of the people indicated an improvementwhich it was difficult to reconcile with the trade situation.The German State Departments, from a German industrialist1spoint of view had a  high share of patriotism.  He had been trying to sell weighing machines to the railways in Germany and,in spite of having works in Germany and having the machinesmade completely  in Germany with German materials and Germanworkmen^ he was not allowed on the list of tenderers because themajority of his capital was English.Co-operative Wholesale Society.     MR. HAYHURST wrote:-    &quot;Figures presented to me reveal that our sales during thepast few weeks show a slight reduction in bulk value on thecorresponding period of last year.  This reduction, however,represents a very small percentage of the total sales and calls for no special observation on my part, as I can confidently saythat our-trade all round is being held in every respect.Banking statistics indicate considerable progress, both in theincrease in the number of deposit accounts and amounts deposited.This is, to my mind, a very gratifying feature, particularly so,as previously indicated, seeing that they represent the financialposition of the industrial classes of the country.     &quot;Batter. Danish. - Having now reached that period of the year when production will be a diminishing quantity, we must look for a hardening in price.  Decreased production is nowgeneral, and the continental demand having an upward tendency,recent short shipments, particularly to the North, have caused the output to be readily absorbed each week.  We have managed,however, to meet our own demand,  enormous as the quantity is*English stocks of Colonial are on the light side and pricecontinues steady,.    It is pleasing i,o say that Irish Creamerybutter has been consistently good of late,  and at presentquotation is best value offering at the moment.     &quot;Cheese.  Stocks of Hew Zealand are running low and market has been steady at high values.   Canadian home stocks are much lower than this time last year,  and with a briskenquiry price has advanced somewhat.  Locally produced Cheesehas continued in a quiet steady demand with a firm toneruling in the country districts.
        GENERAL TRADE (CONTD .) .Co-operative Wholesale Society (Contd.),      Sjogar.   In the early part of the month a steadydecline&quot;in the market for Cuban Raws prompted a reductionof all Refined.  Later a partial recovery advanced BritishRefined 3d. per owt.   During the latter part of the monthmarket beoame depressed, resulting in reductions in Refined,and values are now at a somewhat low level.  The effect ofthe large supplies in prospect for the coming season appearsto have been largely discounted in present quotations.     &quot;Dried Fruit. As oan only be expected at this time ofthe year, spot supplies of currants are now practicallyexhausted, and buyers are anxiously awaiting the firstshipments of this year&apos;s crop.  These are now due and arebadly needed.  New crop Australian sultanas are now movingmore freely.     &quot;Flour.  During the past week or so the flour markethaB shown a tendency towards nervousness.  Spot supplies ofwneat have been on the scarce aide.  Large stocks in Americaand Canada indicate a bearish tendency.     &quot;Canned Salmon,  First consignments of Siberian are to hand, and quality Is best ever seen from these waters.  Thispack has been helpful In meeting shortages of Canadiansupplies during the past few years.  The present outlook forthe latter Is not very bright, and may possibly be an un-important factor in the very near future.     &quot;Potatoes.

The market has shown very  little change,  continuingsteady for all descriptions.  Good liquoring teas had stillruled strong.  The  stock  of teas  in London bonds had continued high for  the time of year,  but from the Board ofTrade figures  the Home consumption had kept a steady increase.The new  season&apos;s  Indian  crops had Bhown distinct signs ofimprovement and  the Ceylon tea had also been a better type.      &quot;Coffee.  Since  the  last report  modest supplies had continued, consisting to  a fair  extent of  East Africancoffees. The  quality,coming forward  had been of a mixedcharacter, but notwithstanding that,  the prices had  ruledfirm,   Costa  Rica coffees continued  in the home demand, butthe Colombian which had  been on  offer had  not met with a large  response at auction.

SIR mfoODtoAN BURBIDGE sent the following report from theIncorporated Association of Retail Distributors.     &quot;Unquestionably the fine spell of weather during the major   portion of the summer months brought much additional  business,   especially in the holiday centres.  September was a   particularly good month, practically all departments  being   well supported.  In August, reports show that  so far  as   London was concerned it is practically on a level with last   year,  the first two weeks being good, but the  last two being   somewhat disappointing.  Staff employment however was on a   slightly  higher level.  Dress goods sho?/ a substantial   increase and fancy goods also show advancement.   Sports and   games  are slightly up this summer, camp equipment being a   particularly good feature.  Outdoor as well as indoor   furnishings also show an increase, although a  30/&amp; larger   employment of credit terms is reported,      &quot;Taking the stores in outer London the figures show that   fancy drapery sections Increased their turnover by 11,81$   while  heavy drapery and fashion sections show  an increase of   5.70/i.  The increase on the average in the furniture  sections   was 1/L  Generally speaking the improvement in the non-food   sections of store business was more marked than in the food   sections,      &quot;Outside of London come good reports regarding most   holiday sections, but the position in the colliery districts   has been very bad, decreases in turnover ranging from lQy* to   307s.  Retailers in these districts are taking  long credit   and some of the-wholesale houses are very perturbed.   A   worrying feature&apos;has been the poorness of the  footwear   sections, and even as late as October the position was still   very difficult,  tost London stores report a 10$ drop in   sales and a call for the cheaper lines.  In some instances   the larger employment of motor cars is cited as the cause,   there being less necessity for a range of shoes.  The men&apos;s   sections have also been rather poor in comparison with last   year,  the outturn of summer suits  showing a 5% reduction In   most stores.  The autumn season at the time of writing, was   opening well, the call for thicker underwear,  top coats,   knitted outerwear etc., showing a substantial  rise.   Employment however was on a lower level, one large store in   London alone, dispensing with the services of  more than   100 people, during the first part of October.&quot;
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.     MR. HOLLAND MARTIN reported that the demand for money inthe money market had been strong and rates had been influenced by the gold exports.  These had been on a large scale, but thebank reserve had been very high and he thought the Bank rate would not be affected.  The Clearing House figures for theProvinces confirmed the reports of other members of the Councilon the state of trade.  The only trades that were doing wellseemed to be the smaller trades and trade in places likeBirmingham, where figures showed an increase.  The Londonfigures had probably been affected by the large amount of newissues.  Most of these issues had been very largely over-subscribed, and Mr. Holland Martin ascribed that largely tospeculation.  In regard to these new issues, their size did not always mean that.new money was going into those industries,because a great deal of the money had previously been found bythe banks and finance houses.MECHANISATION OP PRODUCTION*     MR. BROWNLIE referred to what Sir A. Balfour had said asto the necessity for lowering costs of production in the steelindustry (see section on Steel) and stated that an aspect of.the case that weighed very heavily with them was the wor.&quot;&apos;d-wide increase in the mechanical powers of production, aeoora-panied by a falling off in the demand for human labour.  Quiterecently a pronouncement had been made by an official of theFederal Government of the United States to the effect that within recent years they had increassd their productive power,that is mechanical power, by forty-nine per cent, and thatthere had been a falling off in the demand for lab^fur powervarying from fifteen to twenty-five per cent.  In the UnitedStates, Mr. Brownlie believed,  there were five million peopleunemployed, notwithstanding statements made to the contrary.The extent of unemployment in this country was known.  He wasgiven to understand, when he was in Germany a few weeks ago,that there were two million, unemployed there, and there wasunemployment in a varying degree in other Continental countries and in the new countries.  The output in the shipbuilding-industry on the Clyde had probably been equal to anything thatobtained pre-war and yet there were a large number of peopleunemployed in that area and there were similar numbers unem-ployed on the Tyne.  That was the problem they had to face andwhich was concerning the workpeople very much indeed.   THE PRESIDENT agreed as to the importance of this question and he understood that the World Power Conference was dealingwith it.   The real solution was to increase consumption,  andthat could only come by cheaper production.

SIR JOSIAH STAMP reported that the recent freight trafficreceipts continued to show decreases, but the percentagereductions were not so heavy as they were earlier in the year.For example, the receipts for merchandise and minerals (otherthan coal and coke) and livestock for the last four weeks,as compared with the corresponding period in 1927, were a,b% down, while for the whole of the thirty-nine weeks ofthe year they were 6.3$ down.  In coal and coke the decreasewas 5.4$ for the four weeks, as against 9.5^ for the wholeof the thirty-nine weeks.  During &quot;&quot;the earlier part of theyear the whole of the decrease could be accounted for In thebuilding and heavy industries; after that inroads began tobe made into the receipts for the lighter and more valuabletraffics.  In the case of the heavy industries the decreasemarched with the natural decrease in trade, but in the caseof the industries affected in June and July it did notnecessarily reflect the decrease in trade, because it represented inroads by lorry traffic, and a clash of two different systems of charging came to an extreme point inAugust.  On the passenger side the decline had been arrestedby the widespread reduction in fares, the reduction ascompared with last year being 1.8$. for the 39 weeks and0,91% for the last four weeks.  That had no bearing uponnet receipts, because the amount of work to be done to getthat had been very much greater.  The receipts for allclasses of traffic for all the railways were 2.27/i downduring the last four weeks as compared with last year and4.9;i  down during the 59 weeks.
OOITFILWTIAL.RAILWAY TRAFFIC  (COITTD).     MR. HURCOMB wrote:-     &quot;During the ten weeks ended 30th September,  1928,  the decrease in railway receipts compared with the correspondingperiod of 19 27, amounted to rather more than 11,300,000almost all of which was in respect of freight train traffic.     &quot;For the 39 weeks ended 30th September, 1938,  the  aggregatedecrease was  7,135,000 compared with 19 27, made  up asfollows; -                                                   Passenger Train Traffio ........  1,154,000       Freight Train Traffio:         ivierchandise and Minerals        3,370,000         Coal, Coke and Patent Fuel ...  2,611,000     &quot;The statistics for July shewed a further increase incheap ticket travel and in the number of workmen  conveyed by railway but a heavy decrease in passengers carried  at ordinaryfares.  Comparisons, however,  are affected by the incidence ofAugust Bank Holiday which fell on August 1st in 19 27 and onAugust 6th in 1928, consequently the heavy bookings prior tothe actual holiday are included in the figures for  July in1927 but not in 1928.  The  freight traffic shewed  a decline of nearly 2,400,000 tons or 9 per cent;  coal, coke and patentfuel accounting for 1,600,000 tons or two-thirds of  the  totaldecrease.&quot;                         EMPLOYMENT .     MR. PHILLIPS stated that,  as was well known, during august and September the unemployment  figure had remained  very high.In September it had shown something of a tendency to drop,  but unfortunately in the first week of October there  was anincrease of over 40,000 bringing the total up to  1,336,400.That increase, as far as could be judged, was almost entirely in the coal and the cotton industries.  The figure  for  coal ..had dropped considerably in August and September; it had been251,000 at the end of September as compared with  325,000 atthe end of July.   The whole of this decrease,  however,  had occurred among those temporarily stopped;   the number of whollyunemployed had remained almost  constant at about  180,000.   InSeptember there had been some improvement also in the figuresfor iron and steel, pottery,  cotton and boots and shoes,  but those decreases had been about  equally balanced by  increases inmost  other trades.     The distribution in districts had not been withoutinterest.  The Midlands  had improved considerably  both inAugust and September, while in  the South of England?  which  hada relatively good level of employment, there had  been someseasonal increase in the two months.  Wales had improved inAugust and had lapsed a little  in September.  In  lancashire and Cheshire there had been, a  falling off in August  and so^eimprovement  in September.  Scotland had shown little changein the two months.

AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. SANDERSON stated that the season In Australia generally,except in Western Australia and Queensland, had been favourable,but the lambing had been disappointing and this was the time of year when good rains were required for the summer pastures.  the wool sales had opened, although there had been a check owing tothe strike.  On the whole there  was good competition, but ofcourse, the level of prices was lower.  As regards wheat therecent rains had considerably benefited the wheat areas ofVictoria and Southern New South Vvales and there had also been good rains in South Australia.  The wheat growers in New South-*&apos;ales had decided against the establishment of a  -heat MarketingBoard under the State Marketing Act.  It was even now too soon to say what the out-turn of the wheat crop was likely to be;he could only say the prospects were good.  There was areduction in the wine output of about four million gallons ascompared with last year.  The Trade and Customs revenue showed adecrease of fill- million compared with last-year,  A jointcommittee had been appointed representing the New South WalesGraziers and the Meat Exporters&apos;Association to consider matters relating to the meat industry in New South Wiles.  The prospects of the lamb export trade were reported to be good and there was astrong enquiry from London.  In regard to finance the bankclearances for all the State capitals for the four weeks ending24th September were  177 million compared with  167 million for the same period last year.  Prom the 1st January to the 24thSeptember they were  1,694 million as compared with  1,664 millionlast year.     The Broken Hill Proprietary Company had given a contract toa British firm to construct a battery of coke ovens with plant for byproducts at Newcastle costing  1 million.  An asbestoscompany had been started in Western Australia and showed good prospects of success,,; and Lysaghts, the sheet metal manufacturerswere extenting their works in New South Wales.  Morris Motorshad formed a company in New South Wales and Imperial chemical industries were investigating the question of installing plant forthe extraction of oil from lignite coal and for the manufactureof fertilisers.     As regards the strike, the official advices did not differmaterially from what had appeared in the press, and the position at the moment was a little confused.  Those in a position to know,however, felt that there was an improvement and that,  unless someother unknown factor came into operation, work would be proceedingnormally again before longj the important thing, at the presenttime was the export of produce, this being the  main exportingseason.                         INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY referred to the Bombay strike which had  justconcluded. It had to be remembered in connection  with  that  strikethat the Bombay millowner worked on a different policy to theLancashire millowner.  He liked to work fairly hard for a year or two until stocks got too heavy and then it  suited him  toslack off.  There was no doubt that that had had  a good deal todo with the strike in Bombay.   Another factor  in  the situation
COMDEITTIAL.INDIAN TRADE (CONTD).had been the very heavy carry over of raw cotton on the Bombaymarket; but the position in regard to that had been easedconsiderably.     The news about the monsoon was not on the whole sounfavourable as it had been described in the press.  An absolutelyperfect monsoon could never be counted on and the distributionwas not always what would be desired, but the fact that famineconditions had been declared in a certain section of theUnited Provinces ought not to have given rise to rumours suchas had been current in regard to the character of the monsoon.It was not by any means an abnormally bad one and in factIndia was looking to a continuance of her export trade certainlyup to the levels of last season.  Proof of this lay in the factthat the Indian exchange, which would certainly have gone downif there had been any real justification for apprehension, waslirm at 1/16th over par.     There was some reason for apprehension, not immediate,  butin the future, as to markets for India&apos;s surplus products.They v/ere experiencing competition in some directions where theyhad never experienced it before.  Italian and Spanish rice,  forexample, was competing at prices considerably higher than Burmarice.  Burma rice wes fetching less than 15/- at present and atthat price it was hard to compete with Continental and Americanrice at say 20/-.  The grading and  he regretted to say thequality, of the competing rice was often better than that ofthe Indian.  There was a rumour that Queensland was beginning to compete with India on the London market and that subsidies werebeing given for the export of rice from Australia.  They hoped,however, to be able to hold their own.  They were alsoexperiencing competition from synthetic shellac and various othersynthetic products (from synthetic dyes of course they hadalready had competition);  and a third consideration was that anincreased output in India was looked for as a result of the newirrigation schemes, such as the Sukkur barrage.  They had felt,therefore,  that they should take further steps to stimulate  thedemand for Indian goods in foreign markets and  as a result  theGovernment of India were considering a proposal to open TradeCommissioners1 offices, two on the Continent - in Hamburg and-oilan - and one in New York,  as part of that policy.     The Government of India had also just announced a  new-stores policy.  The old policy had aimed at the purchase throughLondon ox practically all materials required from abroad,  but infuture the development was going to be in the direction of pur-chasing in India.  The new draft rules had just been publishedgiving effect to this policy,   hr.  Lindsay mentioned the matterDecause,  in his opinion,  it enforced the argument in favour  ofBritish manufacturers establishing their own branches in Indiaand not being content to  work through local agents.     The jiapire Marketing Board was issuing a poster to  firmsthat had secured contracts from the Dominions,  to be put  up  inthe factory where the contract  was  being executed,  appealing tothe workers to purchase goods  produced in  that  part  of theLmpire.  Sir Atul Chatterjee had been impressed by  this  posterand was arranging that such assistance as  his Stores Department
                     INDIAN TRADE (CONTP).could give in this connection should &quot;be afforded to  the  empire marketing Board.                     SOOTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE observed that in the Argentine in the first seven months of this year, which was the last summary available,  theimports and exports had quite considerably increased.   In im-ports the chief increase was in iron and iron manufactures,machinery and textiles.  Conditions in the Argentine were some-what affected by the approaching entry into office of PresidentIrigoyen.  It had been anticipated by a certain amount of labourtrouble, which was not entirely unusual, but it was generallyexpected, although not unanimously so, that when he came into office there would be little or no more trouble.  The harvestprospects this year, although it was early to speak of themowing to the liability of interruption by frost, were extremelygood and the area under cultivation was considerably enlarged.     In Chile the most important item that had had to  be dealtwith was the complete change that had been made in the method ofdealing with nitrate.  A centralised organisation of producershad been established, into which all the producers had comeexcept the Americans, who alleged they were unable to  come  inowing to the Sherman law against trusts.  The organisation  wouldhave an improved effect upon the prospects of those NitrateCompanies who were previously almost out of business.   There  wasalso a subsidiary arrangement made with the Chilean Governmentin regard to the question of price.  The official trade returnsfor Chile showed a similar improvement to those for theArgentine.  The recent loan of about  ,5,600,000 raised by Chilein the English and American markets had been raised on very good terms and showed that their credit still stood high. Theirborrowings,  however, in the aggregate had in recent years been quite considerable.     With regard to Brazil, the coffee market was in a dilficultposition.  The amount of coffee deposited with the institutionformed  for that purpose exceeded the amount withdrawn from timeto time,  and they were accumulating a stock,  which,  if thepresent orop gave what it  promised,  would be very embarrassing.Nevertheless,  trade generally was not bad and indeed had  improvedduring the seven months of this year. .     Peru had made their political peace with Chile  after a long-interval ox  years and it was hoped therefore that their relationswould be better.  It was very important  that  they should  be,because Chile  in the nitrate district depended on Peru  forworkmen.   The  income and expenditure  of  Peru  was  said  to  balance,but th&amp;t  was doubtful.     There had been published that morning the news of the saleof the ^white hall Electric  Investments Company&apos;s business in iiexico
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD).and Chile to an American concern.  It was rather striking to see company with  10 millions of capital heinfe sold over to the americans and it showed the additional control the americans were getting in South America.     THE PRESIDENT thought that the fact of Americans taking an interest in public activities in South America did notnecessarily make any difference in the placing of orders. he knew many instances where there were very large Americanholdings and where the orders were placed here.
