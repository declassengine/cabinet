I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    28CP. 338  (28).                                 CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON  THE   INDIAN  CONTRIBUTION  TO   THE   HOME           EFFECTIVE CHARGES OF  THE BRITISH ARMY.                                  REPORT.    1.   AT their Meeting, on the 23rd May, 1928 (Cabinet 30  (28),  Conclusion 10),the Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Secretary of State for War (paper cp. 130 (28)) and the Secretary of State for India (Paper CP. 131 (28)) on thequestion of the Indian Contribution to Home Effective Charges  of the British Army,and agreed to the appointment of a Cabinet Committee constituted as  follows :-             The Lord Chancellor  (in the Chair):            The Chancellor of the Exchequer.            The Secretary  of  State for War.            The Secretary  of  State for India.            The Secretary  of  State for Air.            The First Commissioner of Works.    2.   Our Terms of Reference, as settled at the Cabinet on  the 23rd  May, were subsequently varied  by the  Cabinet  on  the  6th June,,  1928 (Cabinet  31 (28),.Conclusion 2), and read as follows :     &quot; To consider and advise-&quot;        (1.) On the question of the principle whether there should be a contribution.              by India,  and, if the decision is in the affirmative on the  question of              principle, how the claim of the Government  of  India  that there              should be  no  contribution by India should be dealt with.        (2.) Whether the existing  contribution was equitable.        (3.) What powers could be exercised in the matter vis-a-vis the Government              of India, and the Secretary of State for India in Council.&quot;    3.   It was not found practicable to hold our first meeting until the 16th October,1928, a few days  before Lord Birkenhead&apos;s resignation  of his office of Secretary ofState for India took effect. On this occasion, Lord Birkenhead,  after expressing theopinion  that (3) of our Terms of Reference would more correctly read  &quot; Whetherthe Government can exercise  any power against the Secretary of State for India inCouncil,&quot;  suggested that in the first instance we should  examine the legal  and constitutional position of the  Secretary of  State  for India in Council.   LordBirkenhead&apos;s views, which are shared  by the present  Secretary of State  for India,maybe summarised.as follows :     4.   In all political matters the  Secretary of State  for India, if supported by theCabinet,  can control  the  Government  of India and the Council of India, but in financial matters the Secretary of State is dependent upon the support of the Councilof India, and cannot act without that support.  The whole statute law on  the subject is comprised in  Sections 2  (2) and 21  of the Government-of India Act, 1915.In effect, Parliament has conferred on the Members of the Council of  India theright, in the last resort, to refuse their sanction for financial proposals which they      [18431]
  are satisfied are not in the interests of India.  No appeal lies from their decision,  no-one can deprive them of their powers, and legislation ad hoc would be necessary to  compel them to act against their will  or, in the absence of misconduct, to remove-  them from office.stit lu5.   Lord Birkenhead proceeded to assure us that if the Secretary of State for  India placed the proposals of the War Office before the Council of India and made  every endeavour to persuade the Members to entertain them^ there would not be the  slightest chance of their  acceptance  by the Council, nor would the Council modify  their opinion  even  if the Cabinet  expressed the view, that the proposals were  reasonable.      6.   We have  also been informed, both by Lord Birkenhead and by the present  Secretary of State for India, that the proposal that the claims should be  referred to  arbitration is one which  is not likely to be entertained by the Council, because the  question at issue is not one merely of account, but is one involving large questions  of policy unsuitable for determination by an arbitrator.      7.   In  Cabinet Paper 131 (28) a suggestion was made that the question of the  Capitation  Rate  should be  reserved  for  consideration  by  a new  &quot; Webby&quot;  Commission,  the  appointment of  which, whether recommended by the  Indian  Statutory Commission or not, would, it was represented, in any event be necessary.  Lord Birkenhead and  Lord Peel have since proposed that the whole question should  be referred forthwith to the Indian Statutory Commission,  that the Commission,  after hearing all the interested parties both in India and at home,  should  include  recommendations  respecting the contribution in their Report.   The Commission^  recommendations will  doubtless require parliamentary sanction, and we have been  assured  by both Lord  Birkenhead and the Secretary of  State for India that if  the  Government of  the day induce  Parliament to accept the Commission^ recommenda-  tions respecting the contribution, it is inconceivable that the Council of India would  resist a decision of Parliament.      8.   The Lord Chancellor has drawn our attention to the terms of Section 21 of  the Government of India Act, 1915.:           &quot; The  expenditure of the revenues of India, both in  British  India and     elsewhere,  shall be subject to the control of the Secretary of State in Council;      and no grant or  appropriation of any part of those  revenues,  or  of  any     other property coming into the possession of the Secretary of State  in Council     by virtue of the Government of India  Act,  1858, or this Act,  shall be made     without the concurrence of a majority of votes at a meeting of  the  Council of     India.&quot;  and has informed us that he agrees  generally with Lord  Birkenhead&apos;s view  of  the  legal position set out in paragraph 4 above, and that, in his opinion,  the  Council of  India are legally  entitled to refuse payment of the claims irrespective of whether  they  are fair and  reasonable or not, and there is no power to compel the  Council to  pay or to reconsider their decision.      9.   In regard to arbitration the Lord Chancellor has  advised us that,  while it is  within the power of the Secretary of State for India in Council to agree to allow any  disputed claim to go- to  arbitration and that he would be  bound  in  honour to  implement the award,  he cannot  be compelled to submit to arbitration any question,  political or financial.      10.   The proposal to refer the question to the Indian Statutory  Commission is  open  to the following objections: (1) it would involve the postponement for some years  of the settlement of a matter in regard to which it is most desirable (for the reasons  set out in Cabinet Paper No. 130 (28)) that there should be no further delay;  (2)  the  Indian Statutory  Commission might feel justified on broad grounds of policy in  recommending substantial concessions  to India in regard to the  contribution  and  other financial issues with a view to securing a favourable reception for, and ultimate  acceptance of, their purely political recommendations; (3) the offer of the Secretary  of State for India to give retrospective effect to the findings of  the Indian Statutory  Commission is unacceptable to  the Departments because, unless the findings of
the Commission were wholly to confirm the interim payments made, large arrears of payment, if such were ordered, could not hut be very embarrassing to whichever sidehad to make them.  It is urged that,  in view  of all the circumstances, it would be reasonable that India should regard the question of principle as settled, and should pay the claims at such amounts as may  be agreed upon after examination of the calculations, without fundamental change in the basis of the Contribution, until thelatter is altered by the Commission or some other authority.                    7    11.  After examination of the legal position, we have  reached the  conclusionthat the legal right to refuse to make any additional  payment, in respect of the contribution   is  vested   in the  Secretary  of   State  for   India  in Council.    We find, further,  that the Secretary of State in Council has a legal right torefuse to submit any question of liability or amount to arbitration and the Secretaryof State is unwilling to ask his Council to agree to submit the question of the amountof the capitation rate  to  arbitration,  and is only willing to refer the claim of theGovernment of India  for total abolition to the Indian Statutory Commission; andthat the Secretaries of State for War and Air regard this offer as illusory and areunable to accept it.    12.  In these circumstances, we have thought it right to report these conclusions which answer the third question in  our terms  of reference, and to take the instruc-tions  of the Cabinet as to whether  they desire us  to  investigate the other mattersincluded in the terms of reference.Signed on behalf of the Committee,               HAILSHAM,  Chairman.House of Lords,    November 8, 1928.
