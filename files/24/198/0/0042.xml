[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]  $   j-Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1928.SECEET.                                                     Copy No.     28CP. 342  (28).                                 CABINET.PREFERENCE  IN  GOVERNMENT  CONTRACTS.                      NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.               (Previous Papers, CP. 300 (28) and CP. 335 (28).)    1.   MR. AMERY, in his memorandum CP. 300 (28), points out that in the caseof a Government contract  for  manufactured  articles  placed at home, an amountsubstantially equal to 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, of the cost comes back to the british public in the form of rates and taxes.  This  statement is, I believe, demonstrablytrue.    2.   On the other hand, there is no reason why  the taxpayer should pay theBritish manufacturer more  than a fair price.   I have had experience of cases wherethe profit from the ring price is such that a much smaller preference than 25 per cent.would enable the British makers to beat their foreign competitors.   In other words,the Treasury are right in stating that it would be very unwise to make public anypercentage limit to which  we are prepared to go in giving preference to Britishmakers in the matter of Government contracts.    3.   Assuming, however, that  a fair degree  of uniformity is desirable in thepractice of different Government  Departments,  it  is  surely possible to lay downgeneral  rules for their  guidance.   The following are modelled on the practice ofsome private businesses :     (1.) Where by a preference not exceeding 10 per cent, the contract  would be           secured by a suitable British tenderer,  his offer should be accepted, unless           there is clear evidence of a ring price, and the value of the contract is           great, say  100,000 or over.    (2.) Where the  difference between  the lowest suitable foreign tender and the           lowest suitable British tender is more  than 10 per cent., the Department           offering the contract should be prepared to extend the preference up to           25 per cent., provided that there  is  evidence of bond fide competition           between British tenderers.    (3.) Where the difference is more than 10 per cent, and the British tenders are           governed by a ring  price, or there is  only one British tenderer in the           running,  the Department concerned  should have  power,  in the first           instance, to  offer the contract at  a pries 10  per  cent, in excess of the           lowest suitable foreign competitor.  If this cannot be accepted, it should           have power to advance its offer to any figure in its discretion not exceeding           25 per cent,  in excess, provided that the different British firms tendering           at the ring price are prepared to  disclose their  costs - to an  accountant           appointed by the Department.  The Department would then  be able to           see  that the price was fair, and no undue profit made at the expense of           the  taxpayer.    (4.)  This working practice would be communicated to public Departments but           not made public.  It should also not be too rigid, and  each Department           should be free to reduce the upper limit of preference from 25 per cent.           to 20 per cent, in the case of articles in which the element of manufacture           has been small or increase it to 30 per  cent, where it is unusually high.                                                   (Initialled)      A.  S.-M.    Ministry of Labour, November 13, 1928.[18454]
