[This Document is the Property of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.CP.  303 (28).RENEWAL  OF  ARBITRATION  TREATIES.    IN view of the approaching expiration of our arbitration treaties with severalforeign States, I circulate to the Cabinet the subjoined memorandum, prepared at my request by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.    If the proposals contained in paragraph 6 of Sir Cecil Hursfs memorandum are approved by my colleagues, I propose to initiate negotiations with all the Stateswhose arbitration treaties are expiring, and also with Germany, with whom we haveno treaty in existence.  The renewal of the treaty with the United States will requireseparate consideration.                                                              CUSHENDUN.    1.  Several of  the  Arbitration Treaties with foreign Powers  will  shortlyexpire (France, the 14th October, 1928;  Italy, February 1929;  Spain, the 27thFebruary,  1929).   That with  the United States  has already  expired.  If  thesearbitration treaties are allowed to lapse without renewal, it will provoke criticismin the country and  will increase the agitation for this country to sign the clause inthe Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of  the Court in legal disputes.  There is at present noarbitration treaty in force with Germany, and, if the treaties with other States arerenewed, it will be desirable also to conclude one with Germany.    2.  A revised  draft Arbitration Agreement between the  United  States andGreat Britain  was submitted  to  His Majesty&apos;s Government in  Great Britain  byMr. Kellogg, Secretary of State of the  United States, in January last.  This draft was on the lines of the treaty then  recently concluded between France and the UnitedStates.  Numerous  treaties following this model  have since been concluded betweenthe United States  and Foreign Powers, but His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have as yetmade no response to the United States  Government.    3.  The difficulty which  confronts  His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexionwith  all arbitration treaties is the  feeling that it  is not safe  for this country to.submit to an international tribunal  disputes which may arise with a foreign Stateout of the exercise of belligerent rights at sea.  Captures effected at sea in time ofwar are brought before the prize courts, and the decisions of the prize courts in thiscountry are based  upon international law; but  if such cases were,  after judgement in the Prize Court, brought before an  international tribunal, there is no certainty that the international tribunal  would take the same view as our own prize courts asto the correct rule of law to be applied.  It has, therefore, been British policy in thepast to maintain that the prize court decisions were final.  It has also been our policy,in  concluding arbitration treaties,  to  decline to accept any general obligation tosubmit to international arbitration disputes relating to points of international lawwithout safeguarding the right to make an exception in this class of case.    4.  The arbitration treaties  which Great Britain has concluded in the pasthave  included  a provision excluding  from  the operation of the  treaty disputesaffecting the vital interests of either of  the parties;  and disputes arising out of theexercise of belligerent rights at sea have been regarded as affecting the vital interestsof this country. It is not likely that this exception as to vital interests can be main-tained in future treaties.  It has disappeared from the Franco-American treaty andfrom all the recent treaties concluded  by the United  States on that model.   An      4626  [18293]
intimation was received privately  from the French  Government some months agothat they would be disappointed if His Majesty&apos;s Government asked for the renewal of the arbitration treaty with Prance  in  the  old terms.   This exception of vital interests is also omitted from the model treaties recently prepared at Geneva.     5.  Since the draft  arbitration treaty was received from the United  StatesGovernment, efforts have been made to find some formula which would safeguard the;British position with regard to disputes arising out of belligerent captures at sea,and none so far  has been found.   A bald exclusion of  all such disputes from theoperation of the  treaty would increase the agitation of the Big Navy party  in theUnited States in favour of a large increase in the American  fleet.  They would beable to urge with good effect that  if American traders  whose vessels are captured by the British fleet cannot get justice through arbitration, they must be in a positionto obtain justice by force.   In April last the Foreign  Secretary submitted  to theCabinet a revised draft of the treaty proposed by the United States.  In this draft the  obligation to arbitrate was limited  to cases susceptible  of decision  by theapplication of a  recognised rule of international law.   It also provided that thespecial agreement in respect of each dispute submitted to arbitration  should,&apos; ifnecessary, prescribe the rule of law to be applied by the international tribunal.   Theintention of this draft was to  exclude from arbitration  disputes about belligerentcaptures on the ground that the rules of international law on the subject were not generally agreed, except where the Governments concluded an  arrangement laying down specifically the rules which the court should apply, as was done in connexionwith the Alabama dispute in 1871.   On further consideration the Foreign Secretarywithdrew this draft treaty, as he came to the conclusion that  to endeavour to avoidinternational arbitration of these cases  in  the manner intended  by this draft  wouldhave the effect of  weakening the grounds upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government have always claimed finality for the  decisions of the national prize courts.   The basis ofthat claim has been that  the courts applied international law.   It is impossible to claim finality for the national prize court  decisions on the ground that the decisionof the court is based on  international law, and at  the  same time to refuse inter-national arbitration on  the ground that  there is  no international  law  for aninternational tribunal to apply.     6.  I am disposed to think that the conclusion of the Kellogg Pact renouncingresort to war as an instrument of national policy offers an opportunity of overcoming the difficulty about disputes arising out of belligerent action at sea in another way,and the result of some unofficial enquiries and conversations  which, at the requestof Lord Cushendun, I held while at Geneva with my French and German colleagues,leads me to think that a solution of this problem on the lines indicated below wouldnot  be  unacceptable to the French and German Governments.  Politically, it isadvantageous for His  Majesty&apos;s Government to treat the Kellogg Pact as openinga new chapter in international relations.   If the Pact is treated as a reality, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be entitled to assume that this  country will not become involved in war in future, except in self-defence or in co-operation with the Leagueof Nations in pursuance of our obligations under the  Covenant or under the treaties of  Locarno.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  are,  therefore,  justified  in  maintaining that all disputes arising from  belligerent action,  whether  on  sea or land, areexceptional matters, to be dealt with as political disputes rather than as disputes which are purely justiciable and susceptible of decision by the application of a rule of law.  I would therefore propose that the basis on which our abitration treatiesshould be concluded would be that of providing that all justiciable disputes should bereferred to  the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, and  thatall other disputes should be referred to conciliation commissions,  with a further provision that if the parties are not prepared to accept the recommendations of theconciliation commission, the dispute should be submitted to the Council of the Leagueacting under article 15 of the Covenant.  Then would come a further provision that,in view of the renunciation of war under the Kellogg Pact, any disputes arising outof  belligerent action  which His Majesty  might be forced to take in self-defenceor in co-operation with the League of Nations should not be dealt with as justiciabledisputes, but should be referred to  the conciliation commission and, if necessary, tothe  Council of the League.  It will also be necessary to add a further exception asregards disputes  arising in respect of countries in which Great Britain has special interests, by reason of the necessity of maintaining the safety of her inter-imperial communications..          ,       ^._^^^^  I
     7.  A solution of the difficulty about  the arbitration of disputes arising frombelligerent captures at sea on the lines indicated  above will not juridically  add-anything to the commitments by which His  Majesty&apos;s Government are already bound.By article 2 of the Kellogg Pact the High Contracting Parties agree that the settle-ment or solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or of whatever originthey may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacificmeans.   By  article  12 of the Covenant,  His Majesty&apos;s Government are alreadyobliged to submit any dispute  likely to lead to a rupture to arbitration or to enquiry by the  Council  of the League.   The only new  commitment  which an arbitration treaty on the lines  indicated above  would involve would  be the interposition ofenquiry into the dispute by a conciliation commission before its submission to theCouncil.  A conciliation commission does not give binding decisions;  it only makesrecommendations which may or may  not be accepted by the parties.   Furthermore,by the  Bryan Treaty of  1914, His  Majesty&apos;s Government have already acceptedvis-a-vis the United States the obligation to submit all disputes not otherwise settledto a conciliation commission, and this treaty, which is still in force, obliges  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to submit to the Anglo-American  conciliation  commission a dispute between the two countries arising out of a belligerent capture at  sea.   Ifarbitration treaties on the lines proposed were concluded and the recommendationsof the conciliation commission were not accepted, and the dispute came before theCouncil under article 15 of the Covenant, the utmost that the Council could do, evenif all the other members were  unanimous in opposition to the standpoint adopted by great Britain, and Great Britain refused to give way, would  be to make recommenda-tions which would be binding  to the extent that if the complainant State found thatHis  Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to carry  them out,  it would be at liberty to go to war with Great Britain.  The correct interpretation of the KelloggPact is probably that even this right to go to  war has been curtailed, but at any rateHis Majesty&apos;s Government would not be exposed to greater risk than they are alreadyexposed to under the Covenant or even without the Covenant, that is to say, the riskof being attacked by the party to whom they refuse to give satisfaction in respect ofthe dispute.     S.  The negotiation of a new arbitration treaty with the United States Govern-ment in lieu of that which has expired will require careful handling.  It cannotproceed exactly  on the lines indicated above,  because the United States Governmentare not Members of the League of Nations,  and, therefore, would not agree to submit a matter in the last resort to the Council of the League.   Nor would they  readilyaccept a refusal on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to sign a treaty in the formalready accepted by some twenty  other nations.   Here again the signature of theKellogg Pact will help to justify a departure,  especially  if negotiations  can be opened at an early date.                                                                  C. J.  B. H.     Foreign Office, October 5, 1928.
