Freight relief;  preliminary scheme.                                Canals.                 Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.          When the Cabinet decided (Conclusions 40 (28)) to anticipate railway freight relief they further decided that thereshould be no anticipation In the case of Harbours and Docks, butthat the cases of Canals and Private Mineral Railways should, ifnecessary, be considered later.          Up to the present only two Canal Companies have raised thequestion of prejudice to their interests from the anticipation of therailway scheme.  One of these, the Aire and Calder Navigation, is largely Interested in coal for export, considerable quantities ofwhich it carries in competition with the railways.  Its charges aregenerally well below the corresponding charges by rail, but thecompany have pointed out that the existing differentials in their favour would be almost, or In some cases entirely, wiped out by theproposed railway freight rebates.  They are apparently content withtheir position under the permanent scheme of derating, as they will then b^ able to afford a corresponding reduction in their charges.They state, however, that they will probably be forced during theanticipatory period of ten months either to allow part of theirtraffic to be diverted to rail or to lower their charges in order toretain it at a loss to their revenue,  AS a matter of equity they,therefore, claim that their rate relief should be anticipated as fromthe same date as is proposed for the railways.   Thair claim hasrecently been supported by the West Yorkshire Coal Owners&apos;Association, who state that some of their members are wholly dependentupon canal transport and would be unfairly prejudiced unless theyobtain the same comparative relief as those  who use rail transport.          Representations have also bean received from the  BirminghamCanal Navigation Company who state that  considerable quantities  ofcoal for blast furnaces and steal works,  and of iron ore, etc.,  are0K5T.506(28).

This Company, unlike the Aire and CalderNavigation, are not themselves carriers, but merely toll takers, thebarges operating on the canal being owned either by Bye-traders orby the Manufacturers themselves.  The Company profess to be unable tofurnish particulars as to the relative cost of carriage by rail andby their canal, and it is not, therefore, possible to gauge theextent to which, if at all, traffic might be diverted as a result ofthe rail freight rebates-  As much of the traffic Is carried by theowners of the works, It appears improbable that the course of traffic would be materially changed during, the interim ten months.          The case of the Aire and 0alder Navigation is on the face of it rather a hard one as it is directly exposed to rail competition.The Navigation will presumably protect thsir future interests by cutting their rates now instead of ten months hence where they must doso to retain traffic.  Their substantial business in coal shippedcoastwise will remain unaffected.          Both the undertakings already mentioned are concerned inmineral traffic but most canals carry some of the selectedagricultural traffios which are included in the scheme for anticipatingrailway freight relief.  It is not possible, therefore, to Isolate thecases of the coal carrying canals and any concession would have tobe extended generally.          In determining the lines of the Permanent Schema the cabinet decided that canal relief should not be concentrated upon selectedtraffics, and that no special machinery was necessary to ensure its being passed on.  It was felt thett the force of competition with therailways would  generally suffice to ensure that the relief would be passed to traders using canals, but that in view of the fact that the canals are not, with one or two exceptions, carriers of traffic, it-would not be possible to ensure that the actual carriers in turnpassed on the relief.  Apart from the objection to setting up a new and elaborate machinery of control, it was not thought that anypracticable system could be devised for controlling the charges made
                             -3-by Individual owners of barges.  If, however, Parliament were askedto vote money for the purpose of anticipating canal relief, it wouldbe expected that effective measures should be taken to ensure thatthe benefit actually reached those for whom it was intendad.  Itwould hardly meet the case to pay the Canal undertaking theestimated value of Its rate relief and leave matters to take their course.  It would be necessary to adopt the principle of&quot;Concentration&quot; for the Canals, and to attempt to secure that therebates or reductions in canal charges passed direct to the person bearing the transport charges.          The difficulties of this have already been pointed out.          Moreover, any special machinery devised in regard to the canals for the interim scheme would be pressed for as a feature ofthe permanent scheme.  Concentration of relief would in turn almost inevitably involve a Canal pool, as relationship between the amountof rate relief and the receipts from the selected traffics will varywidely from undertaking to undertaking.  This would mean a furthercomplication and added legislative provisions.          It is not practicable to bring the canals into the railwayPool as most of them are merely toll takers.  No conveyance charges are available upon which to calculate percentage rebates on the lines proposed for the railways.  (The Government of Northern Irelandapparently contemplate anticipation of canal relief and inclusion ofthe canals in their railway Pool, but as there is only one canal ofany importance concerned the problem there is simple).          Yet a further reaction must be considered.  It appearsunlikely that any extension of the anticipatory scheme beyond itspresent scope could be confined to the canals.  The case of thePrivate Mineral Railways has similar features, while on competitivegrounds Coastwise shipping interests might claim that the relief which they will obtain under the Permanent Scheme from the deratingof their wharves and from dock and harbour relief generally should beanticipated,  any such wide extension during the preliminary period
would involve a serious addition to the monies to he found by theExchequer, since the necessary sum could not be deducted from theamount already announced as available for railway relief.          Collieries owning private mineral lines will no doubtstrongly press their case for an anticipation of relief, if only ofthe relief which they will get as industrial hereditaments under thegeneral scheme as from 1st October, 1929.  They will no doubtrepresent that mines served by public railways will obtain a comparative advantage against themselves and their traffic in export coal reaches the substantial figure of about 5,000,000 tons perannum.   These lines are, however, in no sense public railways;  theyare not subject to the statutory regulation and obligations imposed on public railways and no scheme of statutory charges applies tothem.  They cannot be brought within the railway Pool and have no claim to draw upon the limited sum which has been pi-provided for reducing, the freight charged by public railways.          The request for the kining association was for relief fromthe oppressive burden of freights on the public railways.  This hasbeen met and it would- be open to the Mining Association to make some arrangement among their members if they thought that the specialcircumstances of the collieries owning private lines justify some adjustment.          In view of the serious difficulties attendant upon theinclusion of the canals, and of the probability that such inclusionwould seriously weaken the grounds on which similar claims fromother transport interests could be resisted,  it is suggested that inadherence to the original intention the preliminary scheme should be strictly limited to traffic carried, by the public railways,  and thatthe answer to other claimants should be that  the Government  regretsthat it cannot see its way to extend to them any special anticipation of the relief from rating which sill come into force on the  1st ofOctober,  IS 29.17th October, 1926.
