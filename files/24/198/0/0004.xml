[This Document is the Property of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                         Printed for the Cabinet.Copy  No.    28FUNCTIONS OF  DOMINION  MINISTERS.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    &quot;WITH reference  to  the Memorandum  on the above  subject, circulated asOP. 294 (28), I circulate to my colleagues  a copy of a letter which I have sent.tothe Irish Free State Minister for External Affairs in pursuance of Cabinet 46 (28),conclusion 5.                  . . ,,    I have discussed the matter with Mr. Mackenzie King, who  quite appreciated the position, and asked if there  would  be any objection to his discussing with sir A. Chamberlain  when  he  passed through  Ottawa.   I  said I felt sureSir A. Chamberlain would be only too  glad to do so, though naturally he might wish to consider the whole  problem with  his Department  and  with the  cabinet before  reaching a definite conclusion.    I also circulate a copy of a  letter which has been sent from the dominions office to the High Commissioner for Great Britain in Canada,    Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,                           L.  S. A.                October 16, 1928.Dear Mr. McGilligan,                        Dominions Office, October 12, 1928.    &quot;We  have been  considering  the correspondence  relating to  the  proposed appointment of Irish Free  State  Ministers  at  Paris and Berlin, ending  withMr. Lester&apos;s letter to Sir Harry Batterbee of the  6th October.   We  are  muchobliged for the full statement of the position of the  Irish Free State Government.   - Action is being taken immediately on the  lines desired in the last  paragraphof Mr.  Lester&apos;s letter in order to  ascertain the views of the French and german governments on the principle of these appointments.    As regards the question  referred to in the earlier paragraphs of Mr. Lestersletter as  to the  possible variation of the wording of the notes constituting the formal  official notifications of  these appointments  to the French and german governments, preliminary consideration has been given to the  question  by theCabinet  here.   It  was  felt that  the  matter was  one in which Sir  austen chamberlain took so special and personal  an interest that  we should like him toknow about it and also like  to have his advice.  I was asked by the Cabinet totell you  this, and  that we  wanted, accordingly, to defer further considerationpending Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s return next month.  I am  sorry for  the delay,but you  will, I  feel sure, appreciate the  position.   Incidentally, of course, some delay would be  inevitable in any case, in view  of  consultation  with  the  otherDominions.  We have communicated to the New Zealand  Government  a copy ofthe telegram which the Free State  Government  have sent to Canada, Australiaand  South  Africa, and we shall be much interested, in due course, to see the replies  of  those Governments.  We  are letting them have, by telegraph, the gist of this  letter.                                                  Yours sincerely,                                               (Signed)      L.  S. AMERY,SECRET.CP.  304 (28).CABINET.[18303]
My dear Clark,                              Do-tninions Office, October 1.2, 1928.    You will  remember that, before you left for Ottawa, I mentioned  to you thequestions which had arisen in connection with the appointment of the canadian minister at Paris and of Irish Free State  Ministers at Paris and Berlin, and  Iunderstand that Liesching took out copies of the chief correspondence which  hadtaken place on this subject up to the date of your departure.    I now enclose copies of memoranda circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretaryof State and  by  Lord Cushendun, which show the latest developments.  Thesecame before  the  Cabinet  on the 10th October,  and  the conclusion was  that consideration  of  the  memoranda should  be  adjourned until  the return ofSir Austen Chamberlain, and that the Secretary  of  State for Dominion affairs should be asked to inform the Prime Minister of Canada and the Irish Free  StateGovernment accordingly.  I enclose copies of a letter to the Minister for  external affairs of the  Irish  Free State and of telegrams to the other Dominions sent inconsequence.  Mr. Amery proposes to explain the position to  Mr. Mackenzie Kingpersonally.    It seems&apos; possible that, when Sir Austen  Chamberlain is in  Ottawa,  Mr.Mackenzie King (if he has returned by then) may mention the matter to him.  Iam accordingly enclosing  a  complete set of  the papers on the subject, which  youwill be able to give to Sir Austen Chamberlain if they are required.                                                Yours sincerely,                                            (Signed)      E. J.  HARDING.
