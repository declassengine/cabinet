Copy  No.  28CP. 311 (28).CABINET.REPARATIONS AND ALLIED  DEBTS.     MEMORANDUM BY THE  CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER ON HIS                       CONVERSATIONS IN PARIS.        (Circulated with reference to Cabinet 47 (28), Conclusion 4.J    M.  POINCARE received me cordially this morning and immediatelyspoke frankly about the French position on  the forthcoming ReparationsConference.   France was content with the present situation, provided itwould continue indefinitely, and she would  not have sought the present occasion for altering it. He, M. Poincare, had been led to  believe thatthere was  a chance of getting  an  arrangement  of  a more  durablecharacter.   The  initiative  should  come from  Germany   and if theGermans put forward reasonable  proposals  the  French would consider them in a favourable spirit.  The  French would require first of all thatthe German proposals should relieve them of all anxiety about  their war debts to England and the United States, and that over and above this there should be &quot; something important &quot; for them on account of  theirdevastated regions.   I said that our general attitude towards the existingarrangement was the same-as  his.  We were  content with it, but, likehim, would. be glad  of a greater security  for  its  continuance.   Ourposition was the Balfour note, which  meant that  the  taxpayers  ofthe United Kingdom, apart from the British Empire, should receive from europe  enough to pay America.  There was  also the question of  arrears,which amounted to Jl80 millions, involving  9 millions a year interest.This, I said, however stood in a somewhat different position from the rest ofthe Balfour note  and might be the subject  of  further study.  I pointed    [18335]
out that,in any mobilisation of German capital as a part of or supplement to german reparation annuities, we should expect that the Spa percentageswould rule and that France would not have priority of mobilisation in herfavour.  He made no objection to this.  I then referred to the ratification ofthe Caillaux-Churchill Agreement.   He gave his opinion that no FrenchParliament would ratify  it,  but that the French Government had thepower to ratify without  formal Parliamentary endorsement.  This was what we  (the British)  had  done, and  the French  constitution  onlyrequired the formal assent of  Parliament in cases where an increasedcharge was imposed upon France.   In the Caillaux-Ch archill agreement the  charges  on   France  were not  increased,  but,   on the contrary,diminished.  Once he felt that  there was a real security for the continu-ance of the German payments during  the currency of the  debt obligation,he would be ready to consider  ratification on the responsibility of theexecutive Government,  which  the  French  Parliament would probablyallow.  I said I had heard rumours, which I  did not believe, that therewas an idea of ratifying the Mellon-Berenger Agreement  before  dealingwith  ours; that   this would  cause a most  deplorable  impression  inEngland, and would upset us all very much indeed.  He assured me that both the agreements would be treated exactly the same by him.    He  then  followed  up his remark that the initiative about  newreparation proposals rested with the Germans by suggesting that Berlinmight be the best place for the  Conference.  If Paris were chosen france might have to pay for the privilege  of holding the Conference.   I said Ihad felt exactly the  same about London and that  the British  Cabinetrather liked the idea of Berlin.   As  to Geneva, we had had a good deal ofthat lately. Brussels was another  alternative.    M. Poincare then proceeded that the most difficult part of the subject was the composition of the experts  committee.  He knew that Mr. ParkerGilbert   wanted  a  committee of  independent  experts  incommend to the German people and  the American investors in the most favourable way any scheme which emerged, and that the Germans mightbe reconciled  to  giving more on this basis.   Fie himself apparently hadbeen  much influenced  by Gilbert, but  the French  Cabinet took  theother view and  held  strongly  that they  could not part with executive responsibility  in  a matter which  affected the Budget  and the wholefuture of  France.   The French  Cabinet thought that they would  beplaced in an invidious position if they had to reject the recommendationsof an independent expert committee.  He was  therefore bound to reservethis matter at any rate until the French Cabinet met again on the 30th.    My  colleagues will recognise how very  similar these misgivings  ofM. Poincare are to those which I have expressed.  I told him that I had felt  the  same apprehensions  and  that was  why  it was so importantbefore we  committed ourselves to  an independent expert conference, toestablish off the stage the main bases on which we could  agree, a If these
 were satisfactory, the independent experts might deal with the technical aspects and  present the results in the most impressive and favourable form; but that if there was  no prospect of agreement disclosed before- hand the  Governments had better be represented by persons under their control and thus avoid  an open public breakdown.  Here again we were altogether in agreement.     All this led me to come into a little  closer detail.   I said we should expect that France would  not in any conference challenge  our position on the Balfour note, and he said that he entirely agreed with me.  I then said  that we  thought our  requirements might be met on a basis of  100 millions.  This would give  us  the   38 millions which we require from 1932 onwards in order to pay the United States, and it would give the  French  &quot; something  important&quot;  over  and above  their war  debt obligations.   He did not noticeably dissent from this figure,  so I went on that, if England was  to  have her . 38  millions in 1932 out of a  total annuity of  &apos;100 millions, that could  only be realised if all  the military charges for the occupation  of the  Rhine were terminated and the whole of the  100  millions  became available for  the creditor Powers.   This would mean that the evacuation  of  both  the military zones would haveto be faced as a part of  such an agreement.   I did not want  to press unduly for any statement from him upon this point, but  we must  go forward together with a clear knowledge of what lay in our path; and I added that nothing would be more likely to induce the  Germans to make a really satisfactory offer than the certainty of the early evacuation of  their soil  from  foreign troops.   For this part  of the conversation I used the interpreter, M. Camerlynck, in order that M. poincare might not interrupt me till I had  got it all out.  I was very much pleased with the way in which he took it.  His face became graver while I was telling the interpreter what to say, but when it was all translated,  all he said  was that this was a more delicate question and a grave one of general politics.  He  did not scout it in any way.  And when  I said that of  course alternatively if there was not complete  evacuation  the  100 million  figure  would have to be raised in order to cover the  creditor requirements,   and  that anything  over  100 millions  seemed to be leaving the regions of reality, he assented,  or at any rate acquiesced quite amicably.    We then  invited Mr. Parker  Gilbert, who by arrangement  had  now arrived, to join us, and we  explained  to him briefly the course of our conversation.    Gilbert as usual was helpful and hopeful.   He thought wewere all in agreement in the main  and that our positions were reasonable. He urged the importance of an independent  committee whose work was &apos;not too much pre-judged beforehand, but he recognised  the uneasinesswhich executive Governments and  Finance Ministers might feel upon the&apos;subject, and he applauded  the efforts  we were making  to  explore theground beforehand.   He agreed with us that  the next move  lay with theGermans and he would himself go to Berlin  in  a few days&apos;  and use1 all ;
 his influence to bring thenvlorward^to^the,-necessary point.  Poincare suggested and I agreed that he and I should exchange  brief and precise notes stating  our main  requirements,  and the Germans  could  then be nia.de aware of these positions in whatever was thought to be the best^flfplomatic method. We all agreed it was most important to tell the Italians at the earliest moment to prevent their becoming suspicious.   I therefore sent the telegram, which I have reported separately to the  Foreign Office.      I am bound to say  that  M. Poincare&apos;s whole attitude fully bore out the accounts which Mr. Parker Gilbert had given  me.  I think he wants a settlement and is prepared to  run risks for it.   I do not  think there is any danger of the French trying to manoeuvre  us into an awkward corner.  If the Italians will send Pirelli over to London I expect.we can reach a  satisfactory  understanding with  them.  Everything then  will rest with the Germans.   It is for them to say what price in prolonged national effort they will pay to secure the liberation of  their  soil and their finances from foreign control, and a definite  reduction in the total of their annuities, a vast scaling down of the capital charge and the end of uncertainty for their  financial future.  These  are great inducements. They have  not been promised to  them yet,  but it is clearly open for Germany to ask and to make an offer proportionate to such prizes.                                                            W.
