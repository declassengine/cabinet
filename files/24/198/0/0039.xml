9  9 ^. THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                                28jgr.                                                 COPY NO,339 (28).                                CABINET.              By.PENDI.TURE OH PUBLICITY FOR THE BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR.                 Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.               I wish to bring before my colleagues the question of the           25,000 grant for the British Industries Fair.               After a Cabinet decision last January (Cabinet 3(28),          Conclusion 7), a telegram was sent to the Dominions          suggesting that the  25,000 should be provided for the 1929          Fair from the Empire Marketing B&apos;und.  The telegram pointed         , out that anything that could be done to Increase the ,sale of          our manufactures would have a beneficial result on the          marketing of overseas produce in this country, and that the          position of the Empire Marketing Board in relation to the          manufacturing industries in this country would be strengthened          if this contribution to the success of the Fair were  made          from the fund.               All the Dominions concurred except Australia.  Mr. Bruce          replied that he felt strongly that  the precedent  so created          would  be dangerous  and might lead to the. undermining  of&apos;the          whole  basis upon which the Empire Marketing Board had been          established.  He confessed reluctance to object in view of          the fact that the whole of the funds were provided by the          British Government,  but felt he had no alternative but to do          BO .                On the  matter  coming  before the Cabinet,  it  was  decided,          in view of  the  cut  in  the  Empire Marketing Board  Vote which          had just  been agreed upon, to withdraw the proposal  and  the          money was  provided  from Exchequer  funds  (Cabinet  9  (28),          Conclusion 10),  but It was agreed  that the Secretary of
State for the Dominions should telegraph personally toMr. Bruce expressing the strong feeling of the Cabinet that itwas not prudent, even in the Interest of Australia, to take toonarrow a view of the directions in which expenditure by theEmpire Marketing Board was justified.     The question now arises with regard to the 1930 Fair,since It is essential to make arrangements for publicity duringthe currency of the 1929 fair.     The Fair oontinues to make the steady progress to whichI referred In my previous memorandum.  The last Fair, which wasthe largest up to date, had an exhibiting area of 434,000square feet.  To date over 470,000 square feet has been letfor the nsxt Fair.  From the point of view of our own industry it would be a peculiarly.inappropriate time for this  grant tobe withdrawn, but the Treasury, in sanctioning the grant forthe present year, definitely stated  as their considered opinionthat there was no reason why the whole of the  25,000 should bemet from public funds.     I am aware that there might be  a technical difficulty in bringing a grant to the Fair strictly within the terms of theBoard&apos;s reforenco, but  these terms can of course be  amended.The whole tendency of development of the  Board&apos;s work is  in thedirection of  fostering  inter-Empire  trade rather than confiningthemselves strictly to  the  sale of Empire foodstuffs in thiscountry.  The Board have  subsidised  research  and in  their  latestseries of  advertisements  have  definitely  tried to  further  the.sale of  products  of British Industry.  This  is,  in my view, a development  on  the  right  lines.  The guiding  principle  is,  and should be,  Empire  trade.      A grant -to the Fair  would be  in accordance  with this  prm- ciple. It  would be a grant  to British industry in  Its most representative  character.  I oannot  agree that,  as the
Seoretary of State for the Dominions has suggested, it couldbe used as an argument for miscellaneous grants fron thesame source to be made to Departments of the home Government,or for subsidies to particular trades.  I would point outfurther that the Fair itself Is becoming more Imperial in character and this year, in addition to the Empire MarketingBoard exhibit, there will be a considerable exhibit organised by the Canadian High Commissioner of Canadian manufactures,,     I understand that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs makes a point that suoh a grant, if made from theEmpire Marketing Board fund would not, in fact, effect a saving in the amount voted by Parliament, since the empire marketing Board vote Is limited to the amount actuallyestimated to bo required in the course of the year, and thatif the  25,000 were to bo included in the estimates for1929/1930,  it would be an additional expenditure whether itwere borne  directly on the overseas Trade Department vote oron that of  the Empire Marketing Board.  This presentation ofthe position is open to question.  The amount required bythe Empire  marketing Board is provided on condition that thobalance of  the full amount, together with any amount  short-voted  in  previous  years, shall be held available In future for the fund.     This point  is, however, merely technical.  The main issue  is  whether  the Empire Marketing reference should be read  in the letter  or  in the spirit.   I feel  sure that if itwere  made clear  to Australia that in the interests  of inter-Empire trade  and  in the interests of  the Dominionsthemselves, it  is  undesirable for us  to  take too narrow aview,  an! that  last year  all the other Dominions were willing for the  grant  to  be made, the Commonwealth Governmentwould withdraw  their  objection.  It might be pointed  out
9 -s 0   O       further to Mr. Bruce that such a decision would do much to       stifle or at any rate modify the criticism of. the fund which       has already bsen expressed in manufaoturing circles *                                   (Intd.) P.C-L.Board of Trade,     9th November, 1928e
