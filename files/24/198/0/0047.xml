        This  document ia the property  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;a (Government,                                                                                     zJ i,  Jlj                      Printed for the Cabinet,  November, 1928.SECRET.                                                                      COPY NO.  0 0CP.  347(28).THE CABINET.THE   INDIAN  CONTRIBUTION  TO  THE  HOME  EFFECTIVE                CHARGES  OF  THE  BRITISH  ARMY.      MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR.     The Lord Chancellors Committee  has found that the Secretary of State for India in    15Council has a legal right to refuse to  make  any additional payment in respect of the   IndiaContribution to the Home Effective Charges of the British Army, or indeed to make any   6330payment at all, and, further, that he has a legal right to refuse to submit any question of liability or amount to arbitration (CP.  338 (28) paragraph 11).     No doubt the Secretary of State for India can refuse to pay and  equally Great Britaincan refuse to send troops to India or refuse to send them without prepayment.     But these are extreme measures, hardly compatible with the relationship of membersof the British Empire.   If a refusal to  pay or arbitrate were made  by a foreign State, itwould  be  branded as a  defaulter  and  placed on the  black list of the Corporation  ofForeign Bond holders.     Although the law may allow the Secretary of State for India to refuse any payment,I cannot believe that his public duty  compels him to  take a course as abhorrent  tohonourable men as pleading the Gaming Act.     The Committee rightly  rejected  the only proposal  the  Indian Government putforward,  viz. : to refer the  dispute to  the Simon Commission -a proposal intendedmerely to secure 3 years delay.     I ask the Cabinet to decide :      (a) That the Indian Government shall continue to pay a contribution.     (6) That the Cabinet Committee shall report to the  Cabinet the amount  they think           should be paid.     If the Indian Government thereafter continue  to default, I shall bring the  matter again to the  Cabinet, with a proposal for further action.                                                                      L.  W.-E.  THE WAR OFFICE,           17th November, 1928.(28/17)  100 11/28  W.O.P.  3981
