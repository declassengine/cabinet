SECRET.                                           COPY NO._.P. 327(28)                    CABINET.                     REPORT ON COAL AMALGAMATIONS.               Note by the President of the Board of Trade.                I oiroulato for the information of my oolleagtes the           report which will be presented, under Section 12 of the           Mining Industry Act, 1926, Immediately the House           assembles.                                         P.C-L.BOARD OP TRADE,    let November, 1928.THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.,,
                    Report under Section 12               of the Miring Industry Act,  1926.     Sections 1-12. (forming Part I.)  of the  Mining industry act, 1926, make certain provisions for facilitating the amalgamation of coalmining undertakings;  and Section 12  providesthat &quot;at the expiration of two years  from the passing of  thisAct the Board of Trade shall make a report  to Parliament  uponthe operation of this Part of this Act, including information  asto the extent to which amalgamations  and absorptions have takenplace among undertakings to which this Part  of this Act appliesand all such other information and statistics relevant theretoas they may think fit     These sections of the Act were founded  upon the Report ofthe Royal Commission on the Coal Industry,  1925,  and were designed,so far as statutory enactment was required,  to give effect to  theviews which were expressed therein on the need for a greaterdegree of integration or co-operation in the coal industry ofthis country..   The view which the Royal Commission expressedwas that measures of this kind were desirable both in theproduction and in the selling and in the distribution of  coal;that they might take a variety of forms;  that for the present at any rate, it should be left to the industry itself to  takethe initiative;  that as a general rule, it  would be desirable,if not essential, that all the undertakings  affected should be willing parties to the integration or co-operation to be  broughtabout;  but that in certain cases  (and particularly in schemesfor the acquisition of one undertaking by another) it might be both necessary and desirable to apply compulsion.     Part I. of the Mining Industry Act is designed tofacilitate voluntary amalgamations in cases  where the partiesconsider that an order of the Court and the  relief from stampduties which the Act affords are in fact of  advantage to  them.
It is designed also to meet cases  in which complete  amelgamationcannot he achieved without compulsion being brought  to bear upon one or more of its proposed constituents.     Obviously, however, it is not necessary that  every measureor every form of integration or co-operation between collieryundertakings which takes place shall take advantage  of theMining Industry Act;  and it is indeed a fact that of themeasures of this kind which have been initiated during thelast two years, only a small proportion have had to  be brought before the Railway and Canal Commission.   The  existence of the compulsory provisions of the Act has no doubt been a factor insome cases in bringing about voluntary amalgamations withoutthe necessity of their being actually invoked.    In  other cases,the provisions of the Finance Acts, 1927 and 1928, grantingrelief from stamp duties on the amalgamation of existing companies, though they are less wide than those of the Mining-Industry Act, may have been sufficient to make  it  unnecessary to utilise the latter Act.   But,  however this  may be, it isclear that, In order to examine the full extent of the -Integra -tion or co-operation which has.come about since the  Act waspassed, it is necessary to consider not only the developments which have been sanctioned under the Mining Industry Act butalso the far larger  number which have taken place withoutresort to it.     In doing so, moreover, it is  necessary to  examine thesubject in its broadest aspect, and. to include  in  one &apos; s purviewnot only complete amalgamations of one undertaking with anotherbut every kind of step which has tended in sny  way to reducethe previous degree of &quot;individualism11 on the part of collierycompanies, whether in the actual ownership or control of under-takings in all respects or in the  provision of  certain specificservices, and whether relating to production or to marketing orto distribution.
          It is not any purpose of this Report to weigh therelative merits of one form of &quot;amalgamation&quot; against thoseof another, and in the present state of experience it wouldbe difficult, if not impossible to do so.   Co-operation mayconsist either in complete amalgamation of ownership, or inschemes relating to such matters as power-supply or drainage,on the productive side, or - on the selling side - methods of marketing, development of markets, price-quotation or regulation of competition.          If the survey is to be complete, it should take account even of such matters for example as the degree towhich colliery undertakings do in fact draw their power from a common source, or dispose of their coal through acommon distributor.   For though the arrangements in eachcase may be&apos; between each separate colliery and the power company or the sales organisation rather than between the collieries themselves the effect of the arrangements .as awhole Is to reduce the degree of individualism of each ofthe collieries,          The form of amalgamation which the iv.in.ingIndustry Act was primarily designed to facilitate was the unification of the actual ownership or control of two ormore undertakings.          Particulars of amalgamations in this categorywhich are known to have been effected since the passing ofthe Act are given below,   They cover -3r5-   pits, normallyemploying about fcggq IfcSQ-&quot; workpeople, and comprise 17separate schemes, subsequently reduced to 14  by the furtheramalgamation of the South Wales Anthracite groups..                    x provisional.
                                                         1 Q Q                                                         JL Q iJ                       -  4           The  largest  group,  judged  by  the  number  ofmen normally employed, is  the  Powell Duffryn  group.This now  comprises  3G  pits normally  employing 25,000workpeople .    The Liiokloy  and Oowpon &apos; group  now control-s     pits wAth a. normal  total  of  80,000^  workpeople-;The South Wales Anthracite combine now  covers about 60pits, normally employing about  17,000 workpeople;  theCarIton Main company controls  6 pits with a normalcomplement of  about 15,000 workpeople;  the Ocean  CoalCompany group  has 7 pits, normally employing  about14,000 workpeople; . and  the Yorkshire AmalgamatedCollieries 5 pits with normal  employment  for  about13,000 workpeople,          Other schemes  are now under negotiation, butexcept in one  Instance they have not yet  reached a stage to  enable them to  be mentioned in this  Report.The exception  is an important  amalgamation  of 5 or 6colliery  companies  in  Lancashire, comprising  20 ormore pits normally  employing 16,000  to  20,000 work-people-,   This scheme  has already been  agreed and  onlyawaits formal  completion.   Further  details of it  areincluded  in the particulars given below.





  ft *j6 y a)     But of the- various measures of Go-Operation.by far the largest in scope and in potential bearing upon thefuture welfare of the coal Industry as a whole are the districtarrangements which have recently been initiated  in certain large areas of the coalfields to deal with over-production, regulatecompetition and prices and develop export markets.     The first scheme of this character to be put into operation in the British coal industry was that introduced by the Scottishcoal owners on the 6th March, 1923.,   This scheme provides for(a)   A general levy not exceeding 6d* per ton on coal sold for         inland purposes excluding coal sold to  ancillary or         associated undertakings,  and coal for colliery         consumption.(b)   A special levy on coal for selected classes of consumers,         and(c)   The payment of compensation to collieries  (out of the funds        raised by the General and Special Levies) on an agreed        basis in respect of suspension or curtailment of        potential output capacity achieved by wholly closing a        colliery or seam or section of a seam or by other meanso     The scheme covers approximately 90% of the  Scottish output.     The principal object of this shceme is to concentrate inthose pits which can best afford to trade under  current conditionssuch production as the markets are able from time to time to absorb *     The second scheme was that covering the Midlands coalfieldswhich has been in operation since the beginning  of April,  1928cOriginally this scheme was intended to cover the Yorkshire, Notts.and Derby coalfields, but it now embraces, in addition to those districts, the districts of Lancashire and Cheshire, Cannock Chase,Leicester, North Staffordshire and Tffarwi ckshire
     This scheme provides, for-as-follows i -(a)  A levy not exceeding 3d, per ton on all coal raised.(b)  Regulation of output as follows &apos; -      (i)  A basic tonnage for each member is determined;  in            the first instance it is the output in any year of            the 15 years ended 3.1st December, 1927, selected            by him;     (ii)  a quota (or percentage) is applied each month (in             advance) to the basic tonnage so arrived at.(c)  If a member exceeds his quota in any month by more than 1.%      he is liable to a fine Of 3/- a ton in respect of the      excess tonnage;  and in the case ef systematic excesses      heavier penalties may be applied.(d)  Out of the funds raised by the levy and by fines,      financial assistance may be given for exports and      foreign bunkers, arrangements being made that this      assistance does not operate for the benefit of Inter-      mediaries.(e)  The establishment of a Shipping Bureau to watch the members&apos;      Interests in the export markets,     It is claimed that about 90% of the output of the coalfieldsto which the scheme applies is covered by it, and that it controlsan output of over 100,000,000 tons a yeare     The object of this scheme is two-fold.  It proposes to dealwith over-production first by expanding the Hum.ber export marketby means of subsidised export prices,  the financial assistancebeing provided by a levy on all coal raised in the coalfieldscovered by the scheme;  and second by the regulation of output bymeans of the quota system.     Discussions have also been-proceeding in South Wales with-regard to the  formation of a District Scheme.  The original proposal provided for: -    (a)  A levy of not more than 5d* per ton on all coal raised  &apos;          in South wales.    (b)  Grouping of coals and the fixing of minimum prices for          each group.    (c)  Compensation at the rate of not more than 2/- per ton          in respect of shifts lost through want of trade owing          to the operation of the minimum prices.    (,d)  Pines at the rate of 2,/- per ton for sales at prices          below the minimum,
L. 35.           The  object  of  the  scheme  in  this  coalfield  is to  increase      proceeds  without any definite  regulation  of  output necessarily      closing down  pits.   Up  to  the  present  the scheme has not been      introduced in its entirety.  The  promoters announced at the      beginning of  May that for  the  moment all  that would be done      would be  to introduce a  system of minimum prices in the steata      coal trade on a  voluntary  ba.siSc  These minimum  prices are      still In  force and  no other part  of the scheme has yet been      put  into  operation.4.         In Northumberland  and Durham no formal  district scheme has      yet  been  introduced, but agreed minimum prices for export      business  have been  in force for some time.           In each  of  these schemes  the unit is a  defined a.rea .      This in itself constitutes a notable development in the      policy of British Colliery Owners, but the indications are      that it may be only a step towards some scheme of co-operation      on a still wider basis.  It has in fact already  been agreed      in principle  that the various  districts should consult&apos;      together  as to ways  and means  of  bringing about  co-operation      not  only  between individual collieries in the same district.,      but  also  between the districts  themselves, and the examination      of this subject  is  now proceeding.
