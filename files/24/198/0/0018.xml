COPY NOCoP,  518  (28)o                         CABINET.                 TITLE  OF  HIS  MAJESTY1 S  GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of             Lancaster.(Previous Papers;  CP. 508(28) and CP. 315(28) )               I desire to support as strongly as  possible  the  views          on this subject contained in the  Memorandum circulated  byRSee                        x CP.308   the Home Secretary. (28).               The attitude of Northern  Ireland  is to a  considerable          extent, no doubt, dictated by  sentiment;  but  sentiment is          not a thing  to be disregarded,  and as  I  myself fully  share          this particular sentiment  (being  a native of Northern          Ireland) I know how powerful It is in  that part of the          United Kingdom.   How  little this feeling Is understood by          the Colonial Secretary is  shown by the grounds on which he          seeks to justify the ignoring  of  Northern Ireland in  thep See                              &apos;                        0  CP.315 official designation of His  Majesty1 s;  Government.  We(28).indignantly resent being classed with Newfoundland and southern Rhodesia in constitutional status;  for pride inthe British Empire (even when it submits to the shame-faced.disguise of &quot;The British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;) is con-sistent with an intenser pride In being part of the Mother-country itself.   It is precisely because Northern Irelanddesires to put its non-colonial status beyond the possibilityof misconception that it claims to retain the time-honouredtitle of &quot;The United Kingdom&quot; in signifying the Government
    by which all but its strictly local affairs and adminis-tered,    while those of Rhodesia and Newfoundland are not.         The Colonial secretary&apos;s contention that &quot;His Majesty&quot;s    Government in Great Britain&quot; is appropriate because the    actual seat of Government is in Great Britain is not con-    vincing.   The same argument would justify &quot;England&quot; being    substituted for &quot;Great Britain&quot;, a change which would    certainly elicit some forcible language in Scotland;  but    I can see no reason why Noi^them Ireland should be less    considered In a matter of this kind than Scotland and Wales.    Nor  is there more force in the objection to the proposal    under discussion that &quot;His Majestyfs Government in the    United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot; is    too  cumbersome for convenience.   It only adds the one    word &quot;Northern&quot; to the traditional formula &quot;The United    Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, which has been    adopted ever since the Union, the abbreviated form of which  -    &quot;The United Kingdom&quot;  - remains appropriate for common use.         The reason for the employment of the present inappropriate-    priate title during the last year  or two is explained by    the  Home Secretary.   The  change that has been made in the    title of King  and  Parliament leaves no 3hadow of  justifioa-    tion for Its continuance,  and  it should be nov? altered    before  It has  time to become established.                                            C.The Foreign  Office.   29th October,  1928.
