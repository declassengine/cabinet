[This Document is the Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET.                                                     Copy No.     28CP.  315 (28).CABINET.TITLE OF  HIS MAJESTYS  GOVEBNMENT  IN  GREAT  BRITAIN.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR DOMINION  AFFAIRS.    I  HAVE  seen  the memorandum CP. 308  (28)  by the  Home  Secretaryproposing  an  alteration in the title  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in GreatBritain.   The  circumstances in which this proposal is put forward are fullyset out in that memorandum,  and it  will  suffice  for me to  say that, while I appreciate  the considerations  advanced, there  are  other considerations  which seem to me to render any change at the present juncture inexpedient.    The reasons which have led me to the conclusion that it would be preferable to retain the existing title are as follows :     (1)  As pointed  out in the  Home Secretary&apos;s  memorandum, the  title  was          deliberately chosen as the most convenient phrase for describing the          Government which, while  centred in  London, is responsible in inter-          national affairs for  Great Britain, Northern  Ireland, Newfoundland,          Southern Rhodesia, and those other parts of the British Empire which          are not  separate members of the League of Nations.  The phrase  was          approved by the Cabinet at the time  and it still appears to me to be          the one most  suitable for the purpose.  Its basis is geographical, not          political, and the title has no political significance.  If this were made          clear to the Government of  Northern Ireland, it is difficult  to see on          what grounds they could object to the  use of the present title.    (2) The use of the existing title is now well  established, not only in  this          country and  in  the  Dominions,  but  in international  usage.   Any          alteration  in the formula (especially one involving the abandonment          of the familiar expression &quot; Great Britain &quot;) would only cause confusion          and  would probably be misunderstood by  foreign  Governments, who          might  well  suppose   that  the  alteration  in  title  implied  some          constitutional change  and might, indeed, make  inconvenient enquiries          as to the reasons underlying the change.   I might add that the French          phrase used in references to this Government has always (even  before          the establishment of the Irish Free State) been &quot; Grande-Bretagne.&quot;    (3) The existing title is both  clear and compact.   The  expression  &quot; His          Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  United  Kingdom&quot;   suffers  from   the          disadvantage, as regards international  usage, that it does not include          the word &quot; Britain &quot;; and, as  regards inter-Imperial  usage, is open in          certain circumstances  to ambiguity, particularly in relation to matters          where the  Government here, the Government of the Irish Free State          and the  Government of Northern  Ireland are jointly interested.  The          full expression &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of          Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;  is cumbersome  for use on  any          except the most  formal  occasions, and,  in any case,  is  open to the          objection indicated in  (2) above.    (4) If a change were made now in one of the formulas adopted and extensively          employed in  the  Report of  the  Imperial  Conference,  1926, and  in          common use since, suggestions might be put forward for an alteration          of other formulas which have been generally adopted as  a result of that          Conference.    For the reasons given, I should much prefer that no change should be made.                                                                  L: S. A.    Dominions Office, downing Street, S.W. 1.               October 23, 1928.[18343]
