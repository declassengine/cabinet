6SThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.CP.300(38) .                          CABINET.             TITLE  OF  HIS  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.                MEMORANDUM BY THE HOME SECRETARY.      On the 4th May last the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs announced in the Cabinet that he had receivedrepresentations from Northern Ireland objecting to the use of the term &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain&quot;.   It had beenbrought to his notice that, since the change in the King&apos;s Title,there was a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,and he had been asked whether some title based on this fact couldnot be substituted for that now in use.      Subsequently a letter was sent by the Foreign Office to theHome Office asking for my views on the subject.   The letterstated that the expression &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government In GreatBritain&quot; has been used for international and inter-imperialpurposes since 1926, but that In deference to opinion in NorthernIreland Sir Austen Chamberlain saw no objection to abandoning itin favour of the term &quot;His Majesty&apos; a Government in the&apos; United-Kingdom,&quot; though in any cases where the use of the term- &quot;UnitedKingdom&quot; might involve ambiguity it would be necessary to use the fuller expression &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;, on the first occasionwhen the term is used, and the shorter expression, if required,thereafter.   A similar letter was sent to the Dominions Office.I directed a reply to be sent expressing concurrence In the aboveviews.  The Dominions Office, however, replied to the effect thatthe.present terra &quot;His Majesty&apos;s government in Great Britain&quot;had been considered in connection with the Imperial conference by Sir Hubert Montgomery&apos;s Committee on questions affectinginter-Imperial relations, and approved by the Cabinet Committee
                            -2-which considered the Report, and that while It is true that atthat time the term &quot;His Majesty&apos; s Government in the United Kingdom&quot;was not a possible variant, the present term was deliberatelyselected as the most convenient expression to describe theGovernment which, while centred in London, is responsible in inter-national affairs for Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland,Southern Rhodesia and other parts of the British Empire notseparate members of the League of Nations, and is now well established in this country and in the Dominions and is alsofamiliar to foreign Governments.   The letter went on to say that,while the Secretary of State would not regard the matter as one off first class constitutional importance, he definitely preferredthe existing expression as the more appropriate expression (which,moreover, had the advantage of including the word &quot;Britain&quot;) andhe would deprecate a change being made.   He considered that, inparticular, in connection with matters relating to the Irish FreeState, it was important to preserve a clear distinction between his Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and the Government of &apos;Northern Ireland.      The present title, which has always seemed to me quiteInappropriate, was selected before the change in the ?arliamentaryand Royal Titles, and I acquiesced in its adoption only becauseat that time no better expression was available.  The term&quot;United Kingdom&quot; could not be used because it was at that timeused in the King&apos;s Title in a different context.      This difficulty has disappeared with the alteration of theKing&apos;s Title, moreover the title of Parliament has been alteredto &quot;Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland&quot;, and &quot;United Kingdom&quot; has received a statutory definitionas meaning Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I feel strongly that the title of the Government should be brought, into conformitywith this leflnitiog..  The legends on Passports and TreasuryNotes have already been brought Into line.
          The  term &quot;Great  Britain&quot;  was used in the Reports of the    Committee  on questions affecting Imperial Relations  prepared  in    connection with the  Imperial Conference of IP26  as  short for    Great  Britain and Northern Iceland,  but this is  known only  to    those  who  have had access to these confidential  documents.    The    apparent exclusion of  Northern Ireland from the  title of His    Majesty&apos;s  Government has always been resented in Northern Ireland    and it seems to me now impossible to defend.  The present title    is  not only  inaccurate  but  is  likely to lead to serious    misunderstandings,  particularly in the Free State and Northern    Ireland, as implying that Northern Ireland is no longer  entitled    to  rank as anything more than a dependency of Great  Britain.   I    fully  appreciate the importance of preserving a  clear distinction    between His Majesty&apos;s  Government at  Westminster  and  the  Government    of  Northern Ireland, and it  appears  to me that the  distinction is    perfectly  clear if the expression &quot;United Kingdom&quot;  is used, while    the present title obscures the  real  -constitutional  position.   For    purposes of external relations, for  instance, with  the Free State,    Northern Ireland is under the same Government as Great Britain.    Northern Ireland has a separate Government for purely local    purposes,  but this is  not called, and Is not entitled to be    called, His Majesty&apos;s  Government.          I have had some  discussion with the Secretary  of State  for    the Dominions on this  subject,  but as our views remain divergent    and the question is, in my opinion,  one of major importance in    relation to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as  an    integral part of the United Kingdom, I feel that I  must  ask that    it  should  be decided by the  Cabinet.          I should add that the  title of the Government  was  not    discussed  &quot;by the Imperial Conference, and that no question    arises of  altering either the King1s. Title or the  qualifying  -  formula which followed it in the list of plenipotentiaries  in the    specimen  form of treaty on page 29 of the Summary  of Proceedings    of the Imperial Conference.                                         W.J.H.October, 1928.
