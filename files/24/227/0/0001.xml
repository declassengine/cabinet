REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY.(a) Composition and Terms of Reference.1. On the 25th October, 1929, the Prime Minister appointed a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Kesearch* with the following terms of reference : &quot; To inquire into and report upon the condition and prospect of the fishing industry, including the supply, marketing and distribution of fish, and to make recommendations as to any measures which appear to be desirable and practicable for the improvement of the condition of the industry and of those engaged therein.&quot;2.   The Committee is constituted as follows : Professor W. E. Scott, Chairman.Mr. Charles Duncan, M.P.Captain Basil Hall, E.N.Mr. Eobert M. Holland-Martin, &quot;C.B.Mr. Eobert Murray.Sir Felix J. C. Pole.Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E., Joint&quot;Secretary,   Economic   Advisory joint council y    Secretaries toMr.  Wynn Thomas,  Ministry  of (    the Committee. Agriculture and Fisheries J8. Up to the change of Government in August 1931, the Eight Hon. C. Addison, M.D., acted as our Chairman, first as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and later as Minister. Our work owes much to his conduct of our proceedings .and to his guidance during the period that we were taking evidence. On Dr. Addison&apos;s resignation of office, Professor Scott, on the invitation of the Prime Minister, accepted the Chairmanship of our Committee. We desire to express our very great indebtedness to our Secretaries, Mr. A. P. Hemming, C.B.E., and Mr. Wynn Thomas in an inquiry which has ranged over very many branches of a wide subject and demanded very great skill to be arranged in the comparatively concise form in which this Eeport has emerged. The help of Mr. H. D. Henderson and of Mr. H. S. Moss Blundell, C.B.E., was of the greatest value to us on very many questions which have arisen in the course of the investigations.(b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.4. On the 1st November, 1929, we held a preliminary meeting for the purpose of laying down the procedure to be followed in our inquiry and in order to inform ourselves generally of the problems to be studied. We decided, in the first instance, to obtain from the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and from the Fishery Board for Scotland written evidence regarding *he fisheries in England and Wales, and Scotland respectively. In addition, we invited the Admiralty to furnish us with information regarding the policing of fishing grounds .and the extent to which they could co-operate in surveying for new fishing areas. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Eesearch were asked to furnish particulars regarding their work on fish preservation, and the Board of Trade respecting the conditions of ^service in the fishing industry, regulations regarding safety at sea and similar matters. We also invited the Development Commission to give us the benefit of their experience in relation to the financing -of fisheries research.  From the Empire Marketing Board we received* Note. By Treasury Minute dated January 27, 1930, the Committee of Civil Research was absorbed in the Economic Advisory Council, of which this Sub-Committee became a Committee.
evidence in regard to publicity work. The Ministry of Commerce, Belfast, furnished us with a memorandum on the fisheries of Northern Ireland.5. At an early stage of our investigations the then Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries invited us as a matter of urgency, to consider jiroposals that had been submitted to the Ministry and to the Admiralty by the British Trawlers&apos; Federation, for further exploratory voyages for the discovery of new fishing grounds. We accordingly arranged to take oral evidence-forthwith on this question from representatives of the British Trawlers&apos; Federation, from the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and from the Hydrographer of the Navy. On examination of this question it was apparent that, if any action was to be taken in the financial year 1980-31, it was desirable that an immediate recommendation should be submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government in order that the necessary\y financial provision should be made in the Estimates for the forthcoming year which were then before the Ti-easury. We accordingly submitted an interim report on this subject to the Committee of Civil Research. This question is further discussed and the action subsequently taken by the Government described in paragraphs 144 to 147 of the present Report.6. Having disposed of this interim investigation, we resumed our general inquiry. We proceeded, in the first instance, to complete as expeditiously as possible the hearing of oral evidence from the Government Departments referred to in paragraph 4 above. On the-conclusion of this evidence, we began the hearing of oral evidence from representatives of the various sections of the fishing industry and of the fish trade.7. As regards white fish, the British Trawlers&apos; Federation supplied us with evidence regarding the problems of the trawling industry. Turning to marketing and distribution, we received evidence from organisations representing the wholesale fish merchants at the ports, the wholesale merchants at Billingsgate, from the Fishmongers&apos; Company and from the Corporation of the City of London. We also received evidence from the London Fish Trade-Association, the Fish Caterers&apos; Protection Association and the National Federation of Fish Friers. On the question of railway rates, we were furnished with valuable information by the Railway Clearing House.8. On the herring industry, we received evidence from repre-sentativesof Scottish fishermen&apos;s associations, from the Scottish Steam Drifters&apos; Association, the British Herring Trade Association and from the National Herring Fisheries Protection Association.9. As regards the inshore fisheries, we received evidence from the Fisheries Organisation Society and from the Association of Sea Fisheries Committees of England and Wales. The Oyster Merchants and Planters&apos; Association furnished us with information regarding the special problems of their industry.10. Other witnesses included representatives of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, who gave evidence on labour problems in the fishing industry, and representatives of the National Food Canning Council, with whom we discussed the possibilities of expanding the canning both of herrings and of white fish.11. Finally, we received oral and written evidence from a number of persons possessing special experience of one or other branch of the fishing industry or of the fish trade.12. We held twenty-eight meetings for the purpose of taking oral evidence. A full list of witnepses is given in Appendix I to this Report.18. In the course of our investigations we were much impressed with the desirability of obtaining for ourselves first-hand information regarding the problems with which we were confronted. We accordingly arranged for various members of the Committee to visit certain fishing ports on our behalf. Thus, our first Chairman, the Right Hon. C. Addison, accompanied by Mr. Wynn Thomas, one of our Joint Secretaries, visited Yarmouth, Captain Basil Hall visited&apos; Grimshy, Hull and Lowestoft, Sir Felix Pole and Mr. Wynn Thomas visited &apos; Brixham, and Professor Scott and Mr. Murray visited a
considerable number of fishing ports in Scotland. In addition, several members of our Committee visited Billingsgate Market.14. We desire to place on record our indebtedness to all who have assisted us in our inquiry whether by giving oral evidence before us or by submitting memoranda.(c) Arrangement of Report.15. The fishing industry in England and Wales and in Scotland .gives direct employment to approximately 59,000 persons, of whom roughly 10,000 are partially so employed. In addition, a large number of persons are employed in occupations such as the prepara-tion or distribution of fish, the prosperity of which largely depends on that of the fishing industry. The problems of the industry are all the more deserving of attention in view of the immobility of the population which it employs; in particular, in Scotland, an extensive coastline is involved, and in outlying regions north of the industrial area the industry is of vital importance to a considerable section of the population. Of the persons employed in it large numbers are engaged in some particular branch, but others, though in the main following one form of fishing, devote their energies at some seasons of the year to some other form. For example, a considerable number of Scottish fishermen whose main occupation is the catching of herrings engage in line-fishing for white fish at seasons of the year when herrings are not available. It is thus a matter of considerable difficulty to determine the numbers of men engaged in the various sections of the industry.16. The subject which we are directed to consider falls broadly into two main divisions, namely, the catching of white fish, which is mainly done by trawling, and the catching of herrings, which is done by drifting. An important cross-division is, however, introduced by the inshore fisheries. Thus, the inshore fishermen catch on the one hand herrings and mackerel and on the other various classes of white fish. In addition, there are such specialised sections of the inshore fishing industry as those concerned with obtaining salmon, lobsters, crabs and other shell fish.17. In the preparation of our Report we have, therefore, been faced with considerable difficulty in devising a scheme of arrangement that would be at once accurate and consistent. In our first main section, Section II, we deal with white fish and trawling. In this section we discuss the white fish industry and its prospects, and the conditions of employment and remuneration of the fishermen engaged. In the same section we discuss the marketing of white fish, with special reference to the position of Billingsgate, the imports and exports of white fish, and the possibilities of canning. At the end of this section, we discuss certain questions of general interest to this section of the fishing industry.18. The next section, Section III, is devoted to herrings and drifting. In this section we describe the position of the herring fisherman and the state of his. equipment. We discuss also the pro-ductive power of the industry, the decline in the consumption of herrings in Great Britain, the question of imposing restrictions on the import of herrings, and the post-war difficulties of the export trade. At the conclusion of this section we submit certain recommen-Nations regarding possible means for the disposal of the surplus for export and for meeting the problem of the approaching obsolescence of a large part of the drifter fleet.19. Section IV is devoted to a description of the position of the inshore fishermen who, as we have already explained, fish for herrings and other pelagic fish, salmon, various classes of white fish, and shell fish.20. In Section V we discuss the position of the fishery harbours in England and Wales and in Scotland. In Section VI we consider the question of research in relation to the fishing industry. In Section VII we discuss the problem of the Moray Firth and of the Firth of Clyde, which we found we could not conveniently include in any of the preceding Sections.21. Our principal conclusions and recommendations are su.m-marised in Section VIII.
22. Appendix II contains a series of statistical notes illustrating-in greater detail various aspects of our inquiry. In Appendix III we-give a note on the administration and regulation of the public markets of Paris, with special reference to the sale of fish to which we refer in the section of our Report dealing with the marketing of fish in this country. Appendix IV contains an outline chart showing the principal: fishing grounds in the North Atlantic.II.-WHITE FISH AND TRAWLING, (a) Introductory.23. We project*ose in this Section to deal as far as possible only with that part of the white fish industry which is engaged in deep-sea fishing, reserving to a later Section (Section IV) a discussion of that part of the industry which is carried on from inshore fishing ports. It will be seen, however, that Table I relating to the quantity and value of white fish caught includes all British landings. The best figures available in regard to landings by inshore fishermen are given in Tables XXIV and XXV (paragraphs 250 and 251). Broadly, it may be taken that in England and Wales over 95 per cent, of the landings given in Table I are made by deep-sea fishing vessels. In Scotland such landings amount to 84 per cent. As regards the number of fishermen engaged in catching white fish, it is difficult for the reasons given in paragraph 233 below to separate with accuracy those engaged in the deep-sea fisheries and those who only fish in inshore waters. Again, it is not always possible to distinguish between motor and sailing trawlers used for the deep-sea and inshore fisheries respectively.(i) Kinds of fish and quantity and value of catch.24. White, or demersal, fish are those which are commonly found&apos; at the bottom of the sea and are caught by means of trawls, seines and lines. The total quantity of white fish of British taking landed in Great Britain in 1980 was 14,147,000 cwts., of a total value of  14,7(35,000. The most important kinds commercially are cod, haddock, plaice and hake, which together account for about two-thirds of both the quantity and value of all white fish landed in British fishing vessels. Other varieties in order of total value landed are skate and ray, halibut, sole, lemon sole, whiting and lurbot.25. In the following Table, we give particulars of the British landings of white fish in 1930 divided according to methods of catching and ports of landing. It will be seen that measured by value about three-quarters of the fish are landed at Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood.Table I.British Landings of White Fish, by Ports.Approximate figures.

2G. The differences in the value per cwt. of the catches at particu-lar ports are due to the varying proportions which the valuable kinds of fish bear to the cheaper kinds in making up the total quantity landed, and to differences in quality judged by freshness. Thus, a high proportion of good quality North Sea fish is landed at Grimsby, Aberdeen and Billingsgate, and a high proportion of less valuable fish from distant fishing grounds is included in the total catch at Hull. The proportion of plaice and soles explains the high value per cwt. at Lowestoft, and that of hake similarly affects the value per cwt. of the fish landed at the western ports.(ii) Fishing Grounds.27. The chief fishing grounds are shown on the chart given in Appendix IV. They extend from Morocco in the south to the Barents Sea and Bear Island in the north, and include nearly all the sea to a depth of 250 fathoms op the western side of Europe with extensions into the Atlantic as far as the west of Greenland. In 1930 the largest quantity of fish was brought from the North Sea, which yielded nearly 5,000,000 cwts., mainly haddock, cod, plaice and whiting. This region is the principal source of such valuable fish as sole and turbot. Over 30,000 voyages, averaging about six days, were made by various kinds of English first-class vessels, and 18,000 voyages of an average length of about 4 days by Scottish vessels. The second largest yield was obtained from Icelandic waters, from which over 3,000,000 cwts., principally cod, haddock, and plaice, were landed in some 3,000 voyages, averaging 19^ days a voyage. The next region in importance was Bear Island and Spitzbergen, which yielded over 1,000,000 cwts. principally cod. Over C50 voyages, of 20 days each, were made to these grounds. The West of Scotland fishing-grounds also produced about 1,000,000 cwts., the kinds caught being mainly hake, haddock, cod and ling. About 2,700 voyages, of 11 days each, worn made by English vessels in these waters. Scottish first-class vessels made 3,066 trips to this area, of an average length of 44 days. The Faroes provided over 700,000 cwts., consisting chiefly of cod and haddock, landed in about 1,800 voyages of 14 days&apos; duration. The Barents Sea yielded over 650,000 cwts., of which more than one-half was haddock, and nearly one-third was cod. This was caught in 460 voyages, averaging about three weeks&apos; duration. The only other region yielding as much as half a million cwts. was that off the South of Ireland. The principal fish landed were hake and skate. To these waters there were approximately 3,000 voyages, with an average duration of nine days.28. The development of the more distant grounds has been mainly carried out by English trawlers. Most of the fish caught by Scottish trawlers comes from the North Sea, including the waters; around Orkney and Shetland. The remainder is brought partly from grounds to the West of Scotland and partly from Faroe.29. We discuss later (paragraph 146) the recommendations contained in our Interim Beport for the promotion of the discovery of new fishing grounds.\h) Personnel and Equipment.30. It is impossible to give precise figures of the numbers of fishermen engaged in catching white fish, owing to the fact that a con-siderable number also work on drifters during the herring fishing: season.. From the statistics of the English Department, it appears that the number of fishermen regularly engaged in trawling (except for shrimps) was in 1930, 17,726 as compared with 19,575 in 1913. Further particulars are given in Appendix II, Note 1. These figures include a number of men engaged in trawling for herring, and exclude about 1,000 men occasionally- employed in trawling. They may,, however, be taken as representing approximately the number of fishermen engaged in the white fish industry in England and Wales../    [5598] c
81. In Scotland the number of fishermen regularly employed in -trawling for white fish in 1980 was 3,265 while the number occasionally so employed was 235, as against 2,850 and 270 respectively in 1918. In addition, 883 men were regularly employed during 1930 in white-fish fishing on steam liners.32. Again, it is not possible to give precise figures showing the number of vessels exclusively engaged in the white fish industry, but from the statistics published by the Fisheries Depart-ment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries we estimate that 2,044 vessels were so employed in England and Wales in 1930 as compared with about 2,615 in 1913. This figure is obtained by deducting from the Ministry&apos;s estimate of the total number of first-class fishing vessels (vessels of the second and third class being assumed to be exclusively engaged in the inshore fisheries) all those which from their classification are wholly or mainly used for fishing &apos; for herring. On this basis there were engaged in 1930 in this part of the industry in England and Wales 1,420 steam vessels, 376 motor vessels and 248 sailing vessels. The corresponding figures for 1913 are 1,448. 66 and 1,101 respectively. Further particulars are given in Appendix II, Note 2.38. in Scotland in 19S0 there were 830 first-class vessels engaged in the different methods of fishing for white fish, of which 637 were steam vessels and 193 were motor vessels. Of the former, 338 were trawlers and 25 liners. The bulk of the motor vessels fish by lines and drift nets.34. The average age cm the English steam trawlers is 18 years and of the Scottish about 21 years. Of these, 84 English and 16 Scottish steam trawlers were built within the last two years.(o) Methods of Fishing.35. As may be seen from the Table given in paragraph 25 above, the white-fish industry may be divided into three distinct sections, viz., trawling, lining, and seining. Of these, far the most important is trawling and especially the steam-trawling section, which emplovs about 20,000 men.(i) Steam Trawling.36. Approximately 90 per cent, of the total quantity of 14^ million cwts. of white fish landed in British fishing vessels in 1980 was landed from steam trawlers.37. The steam trawling industry is highly organised on the owners&apos; side. Owners of steam trawlers and liners at each port :are grouped in local asaceiufcions which deal with matters affecting individual ports, and also in the British Trawlers&apos; Federation a central organisation which includes 95 per cent, of the trawler owners of the country and 90 per cent, of the vessels. Some trawling -companies operate at several ports, but the more usual practice is for a -company to keep to one port where it has its headquarters organisation, and where all the company&apos;s vessels land their fish.38. Different ports have developed on different lines. Grimsby. the principal fishing port judged by values, is the chief port of landing for the North Sea fishery. It supplies all varieties of white fish, and distributes the bulk of the catch in direct consign-ments to retailers, &amp;c, only a small proportion going to inland markets. Hull is the chief port for long-distance voyages (Iceland, Bear Island and North Russian regions). It is also the home of the boxing fleet, and the base from which two of the three factory ships operate. The boxing fleet comprises some 70 trawlers which fish the North Sea. Their catch is packed in boxes on the trawlers and collected by carriers and delivered daily at Billingsgate. Three factory ships are being used to develop the Greenland fisheries. They are merchant ships of large tonnage. &quot; Arctic Queen &quot; (10,078 tons) :and &quot; Arctic Prince &quot; (8,878 tons), which belong to a Hull firm, have
been fitted with brine-freezing installations and cold storage. &quot;Northland&quot; (5,201 tons), which is owned by a Billingsgate company, has more recently been engaged in similar operations. Each ship acts as a mother ship for a number of smaller fishing craft. The catch, mostly halibut, is brine-frozen and kept in cold storage on the mother ship. Regular consignments of brine-frozen halibut are senr. home by carriers during the progress of the fishing, and the residue is brought home in the mother ship herself on her return at the end of the season, when she lies in dock and releases-her cargo according to the demands of the market.39. Lowestoft is a port where the old and the new methods of trawling by sailing smacks and steam trawlers are carried on side by side. The hake fisheries are exploited from the West Coast ports, Fleetwood, Milford Haven, Swansea, and Cardiff. Aberdeen is the centre of white fish fishing in Scotland, and accounts for some 60 per cent, of the total Scottish landings. Granton comes second to Aber-deen, accounting for about 20 per cent, of the total Scottish landings.(ii) Sailing and Motor Trawling, Lining, and Seining.40. There are now very few sailing trawlers. Such vessels are only to be found in any numbers at Lowestoft and Brixham and their numbers are dwindling rapidly.41. Lining* is mostly carried on from Aberdeen and Grimsby. Over 75 per cent, of the Scottish great line catch is landed at Aberdeen, from which port a fleet of steam liners is at work throughout the year. Liners fish the western and northern grounds, chiefly on the edge of the Continental shelf to the West of Scotland, but also off Faroe and Iceland, and even off Greenland. In addition to the regular fleet, other vessels, mostly of the herring drifter type, work with great lines in the North Sea from Aberdeen as a base from April to June, while other East coast drifters engage in lining on the West coast, chiefly from Mallaig and Oban, and also from Stranraer and Girvan from about January to May. The larger drifter liners belonging to Eyemouth and Anstruther, are-based chiefly on North Shields throughout the spring and summer, and work on distant grounds extending to 300 miles from the main-land. Liners also fish from North Shields, Hartlepool, Scarborough.. Hull and Milford Haven. The chief fish taken are cod, haddock, halibut, skate and ling.42. Danish seining! is chiefly carried on in the southern parts of the North Sea, mainly from the ports of Lowestoft and Grimsby.43. The bulk of the motor vessels fish at no great distance from the shore mainly with lines.(d) Conditions of Employment and Remuneration.(i) Conditions of Employment.44. The conditions under which fishermen may be employed as-members of crews of fishing vessels are laid down in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which places responsibility for their enforcement upon the Board of Trade. In the larger ports this function is. discharged by the Superintendents of the mercantile marine offices, who are whole-time officers of the Board of Trade. In the Smaller ports where the mercantile marine work is not sufficient to justify the appointment of a whole-time officer, members of the staff of the Board of Customs and Excise are appointed Superintendents or Deputy-Superintendents by the Board of Trade.* By lining is meant fishing by means of lines which vary from hand lines, with two or three hooks, to &quot; groat&quot; linos with many hundreds. These are often as much as 12 miles long, and have shorter pieces of line, called &quot; snoods,&quot; attached at regular intervals, on which tho hooks are carried.t A Danish seine net used for deep sea fishing is a dragnet with long wings,, which is set in a semi-circle, and then hauled by tho lines at each end of tho net on to an anchored motor or steam vessel. In Scotland tho smaller boats, which use tho seine do not as a rule anchor when hauling in tho nets.[5598] o 2
45. The Act provides that no boy under sixteen years of age may Tje taken to sea in a fishing boat unless he is bound either by an inden-ture of apprenticeship or by a special agreement as a sea-fishing boy. The indenture or agreement must be drawn in such form and contain such conditions as may be prescribed by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Board of Trade. It must be executed in the presence of a mercantile marine Superintendent. There are at present three forms of indenture in use, one a general form, one a special form used in connection with the scheme of apprenticeship devised by the Hull trawler owners, and one recently approved in connection with the special scheme of apprenticeship devised by the Tyne fishing vessel owners. Mercantile Marine Superintendents are invested with extensive powers for ensuring the due performance of the conditions contained in these indentures.46. In order to prevent irregularities in the engagement of sea-men, the Act provides (Section 112) that no person shall demand or receive directly or indirectly any remuneration from a seaman or apprentice to sea service for providing him with employment other than the fees authorised by the Act. Any person attempting to do so is liable to a fine not exceeding  5 for each offence.47. The skipper of every fishing vessel of twenty-five tons* or upwards is required under the Merchant Shipping Acts to enter into an agreement in a form approved by the Board of Trade with every seaman or apprentice he carries as a member of his crew. The number of hands carried on the vessels varies in accordance with the size of vessel and the nature and location of the fishing operations. For instance, the smaller vessels fishing exclusively in the North Sea carry a crew of 9 hands, whilst vessels fishing in Arctic waters carry a crew of 12 to 14 hands.48. The Agreement sets forth the method and rate of remu-neration for each member of the crew, and defines the number of shares into which the net profits of the voyage are to be divided, together with the manner of their division. It also specifies all the items of expense incurred in connection with the voyage which may be deducted from the gross earnings of the vessel&apos;s voyage. These items do not represent the whole of the expenditure incurred in the working of the vessel. For instance, they do not include any charge for the initial cost of fishing gear, the steel warps, otter boards, nets, floats, bobbins and ox-hides, for the fixed wages paid to the crew, for the cost of insurance of vessel and crew, or for repairs to the vessel and machinery. The cost of providing these items is considerable, and, unless the result of the fishing voyages is consistently good, the accounts of the vessel at the end of a year show a debit balance, although the skipper, mate and crew may earn a reasonably good living.49. The provisions of the Act in regard to the signing of agree-ments in the case of fishing vessels differ in an important respect from those prescribed for foreign-going merchant ships. For the latter it is laid down that the agreement with the crew must be signed by each seaman in the presence of a Marine Superintendent, who must cause the agreement to be read over and explained to each man or must other-wise ascertain that he understands its purport before he signs it. In order to comply with these regulations, it follows that it is necessary for such agreements to be signed at the Board of Trade offices. In the .ease of fishing vessels, however, the attestation of the agreement by the Marine Superintendent is not compulsory, the duty of ascertaining that each man understands the meaning of the agreement resting with the skipper instead of with the Superintendent. Each seaman is required to sign the agreement in duplicate in the presence of the skipper or owner, who attests his signature. The original copy of the agreement is retained by the skipper until the end of the voyage, when it is deposited at the marine Superintendents office.   The duplicate* In the case of stoanror motor trawlers the proscribed minimum is 25 tons gross tonnage. In the case of sailing trawlers the prescribed minimum is 25 tons net tonnage.
(Copy must be sent by the skipper to the Superintendent immediately it has been signed.50. The Board of Trade charge a small fee for the witnessing of agreements by Marine Superintendents. Until recently this was 6d. for each man engaged or discharged, but is now Is. a man. We under--stand that before this increase was made many owners availed them-.selves of the services of the Marine Superintendents for the attestation -of men on engagement. There has, however, been a substantial falling off in the number of men signed on at the Board of Trade offices since the rate was increased, the agreement now, as a rule, except at Aber--deen, being signed in the o\vner&apos;s office or on board the vessel in the presence of the skipper.51. The owner or skipper of every fishing boat is bound to give to (every member of the crew an account of wages or share, as the case may be, in the form approved by the Board of Trade. In the case of ^skippers and mates, the settling accounts must show in detail the -amounts for which the fish has been sold and all deductions from those -amounts chargeable either in respect of stores or of provisions or otherwise.52. Every Superintendent is bound to inquire into, hear and determine any dispute either between the owner of a fishing boat and the skipper or a seaman of the boat, or between a skipper and a sea-man, concerning the skipper&apos;s or seaman&apos;s wages or share, or any-deduction therefrom; or his engagement, service or discharge, or the cost, quantity, or quality of the provisions supplied to the crew, if any party in the dispute calls on him to decide it. The Superintendents decision is final and binding on all concerned.   Frequent recourse is:had to Superintendents for the settlement of such disputes.(ii) Remuneration.53. Neither the methods nor the rates of remuneration are uniform at all British fishing ports. They may even vary at a particular port according to the class of vessel and the type of fishing. The general principles governing the remuneration of British trawl fishermen are as follows.54.   Skij)per and Mute. The skipper and mate receive a share-of the net earnings of the fishing voyage. These are divided into 14 shares,  and of these the skipper usually receives If shares-and the mate usually 1 or 1^ shares. At some ports the skipper and mate also receive a bonus in the event of the net earnings of their vessel&apos;s voyages aggregating an agreed sum in a given time, and they participate in the sharing of stocker* where such is an agreed part-of the method of their remuneration. The basis on which these bonuses are paid and the rate of the bonus varies as between port-and port, and even between owners at one and the same port.55. Deck and Engine-Room Ratings. The general practice, though it is not uniform at all ports, is for all deck and engine-room ratings to be paid a weekly wage and, in addition, to receive a share of the net earnings of the voyage of the vessel, which is commonly termed poundage. The amount of the weekly wage, and also the rate -of poundage, varies according to the rating of the fisherman, &amp;c.56. At some ports the crew receive certain perquisites, e.g., -stacker, livers and roes, in addition to a fixed weekly wage and poundage.   Such perquisites vary according to port custom.57.   Livers are usually a perquisite of the crew.   Unlike the rest -of the catch of the vessel, they are not put on the market and sold for the best price obtainable, because the demand for them is limited.   The usual practice is for a fish-oil factory to arrange to take -all livers at a price per barrel, which is determined by the market* Stocker consists of the price realised by the sale of certain of the less valuable varieties of fish. At some ports stockor has been compounded for a fixed percentage of the gross takings, c.y., at Ramsgate where it is 5/- per  100 gross.
value of the oil produced therefrom. The factory supplies the barrels--and collects full barrels from the vessel on her arrival in port. The price of livers has recently been drastically reduced, to bring it more into line with the market value of the resultant oil. The oil has become practically unsaleable since the middle of 1930, and very large stocks have accumulated.(iii) Money Value of Total Earnings.58.   A statement prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries giving the rates of pay of steam trawler ratings at the-principal   English   and  Welsh   trawling  ports  in   force  on   the 1st   November,   1930,   is  given  in   Appendix  II,   Note   7.    A statement   prepared by the British Trawlers&apos; Federation showing, the average weekly income from share, wages, poundage, stocker, livers, &amp;c, together with the value of the food provided for crews when at sea, at certain specified ports, viz., Aberdeen, Fleetwood,.. Hull, Grimsby, Lowestoft and Swansea, for the year 1929 is given in Appendix II, -Note 8.(iv) Labour Questions.59.   The trade union witnesses who appeared before us readily admitted that the organisation of the deck staff in steam trawlers-  as  distinct from  engineers  who are organised in  local  trawler-engineer  unions has proved  to be  a very  uphill  task.    Such organisation as exists is largely in the making.   This is hardly to be wondered at in view of the strong individualistic tendencies of the-fisherman which the independent nature of his work intensifies. The   chief  complaints  put  forward  by  representatives  of   such organisations had relation to (a) the signing on and off of the crews, (b) conditions of safety at sea, (c) settling sheets, and (d) the sale of&quot; fish at ports.60. Signing On and Off. Trade Union witnesses attached great importance to the signing on and off of crews taking place at the-Board of Trade offices before a Marine Superintendent instead of at the owner&apos;s office or on board ship, as is usually done at present. It is claimed that if this was compulsory it would do much to check irregular practices in connection with the engagement of men for service on fishing vessels. In particular, it was suggested to us that it would be more difficult for &quot; ships&apos; husbands &quot; or &quot; runners &quot; to obtain sums from men as a tacit condition of engaging them, which they alleged takes place from time to time in spite of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act referred to in para-graph 46 above. It does not appear from our evidence that such practices are widespread, though no doubt from time to time-irregularities of this kind occur. For this and other reasons we share the view that it would be of advantage if the conditions under which crews of fishing vessels are engaged were placed on the same basis as those obtaining in the case of crews of foreign-going vessels. We therefore recommend that the relevant section of the Merchant Shipping Act should be amended to render compulsory the signing-on of the crews of fishing vessels at Board of Trade offices in the presence of a Marine Superintendent. If effect is given to this-recommendation, it should, we hope, be possible, in view of the larger number of seamen in respect of whom fees would be paid, to reduce the fee per seaman charged.61. Life-Saving Appliances.- The provision of life-saving appliances on fishing vessels is governed by a set of rules laid down in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and not, as is the case with all other vessels, by rules which can be varied from time to time as-conditions require. The appliances carried on fishing vessels are not in fact limited to those prescribed in 1854, but it is very desirable that fishing vessels should be governed bjr up-to-date regulations, and we recommend that the earliest opportunity be taken to make the necessary amendment in the law.
62. Settling Sheets. It was represented to us in evidence that :the safeguards in the Merchant Shipping Act designed to ensure fair dealing as between owners, skippers and men are inadequate. They were criticised from the following points of view  -(a) At present only skippers and mates (who are paid entirely by share) are entitled to receive from the owners a detailed statement of the receipts and expenses of the voyage. In a few cases the other members of the crew receive such statements, but, as a rule, the only statement open to their inspection is that hanging up in the owner&apos;s office. In some cases, we were informed, even this was not available.-(b) It was also alleged that at certain ports men were reluctant to lay complaints before Marine Superintendents or to ask the owners for information in regard to settling sheets for fear of victimisation. Thus, it was alleged that in some ports the name of a man who makes complaints or asks questions on such subjects is communicated to other firms through the owners&apos; association, with the result that such a man finds it difficult or impossible to obtain employ-ment for a considerable time after making such a com-plaint. Naturally no specific evidence was submitted to us in support of a general allegation of this kind, but from such information as we have been able to obtain in evidence or at the ports, we are satisfied that at some ports men do in fact fear they will be victimised if they make complaints to the Marine Superintendent.68.   After careful consideration of this problem in the light of the -evidence submitted to us, we recommend that Parliament should be invited to amend the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, in relation to the employment of men on fishing vessels in the following respects: (a) It should be made compulsory for owners lo give to each member of the crew of a fishing vessel who is paid partly by share in the profits a detailed settling sheet in the form now furnished to skippers and mates.(b) It should be made compulsory for the owner of a fishingvessel to furnish to the Marine Superintendent a certified true copy of the settling sheet issued to the skipper, master and crew. Failure to do so should be made an offence subject to a substantial fine. -(c) The Board of Trade should be given such powers as may be necessary to enable Marine Superintendents to satisfy themselves that settling sheets submitted to them represent a true statement of the cost of a voyage and of the proceeds therefrom. Superintendents should be empowered to make such inquiries from time to time and to take any necessary action against the owners, without waiting for complaints to be received.64. Another source of discontent to which expression was given &quot;in the evidence laid before us is to be found in the present system by which the auctioneer who sells the fish at the port is usually the servant of the owner of the vessel. It was suggested to us that, as a result, it sometimes happens that the correct amounts that the fish fetched at auction were not set out in the sales notes which are used to support the settling sheets. Thus, it was suggested that sometimes the rate on such sales sheets is less than the rate at which the fish is actually sold, or that the salesman permits the&apos; purchaser to appropriate a larger number of boxes than has in fact been knocked down to him, with the result that the full number of boxes sold is not credited in the settling sheet. Again, it was alleged that in one port the prices obtained for boxes sent off by an early train before the beginning of the auction were not always included in the settling sheet. The witnesses who made these allegations did not suggest either that these irregularities were wide-spread or of common occurrence. They claimed, however, that the fact that such irregularities could and did take place from time to time
If)tended to undermine the confidence of ships&apos; crews in the accuracy&apos; of the settling sheets to an extent out of all proportion to the-frequency of their occurrence.65. To meet this complaint, we recommend that Parliament should be asked to confer upon the Board of Trade power&apos; after-inquiry to prescribe by Order in cases of ports where they consider such a course desirable that the sale by auction of trawled fish which affects the settling sheets between owners, skippers and crews should only be conducted by salesmen independent of the owners of the-fishing vessels. In such cases, the servants of railway companies, dock companies, or local authorities might be appointed salesmen.66. The amendments of the law recommended in the preceding; paragraphs would throw some additional work upon the Marine Department of the Board of Trade and might entail a small increase in staff. The sum involved would not be considerable; but the financial difficulties of the present time are, we realise, such that no new expenditure of this kind would be justified unless it can be shown that it is really required for the proper conduct of an essential service. After full consideration, we are satisfied that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act safeguarding the conditions of employ-ment in the fishing industry are inadequate in the respects indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, and should in the public interest be-amended in the sense we propose. Notwithstanding, therefore, the financial difficulties of the hour, we are of opinion that immediate effect should be given to these recommendations.67. Even when the law has been amended in the sense recom-mended above, the problem of regulating the conditions of employment in the fishing industry will remain difficult owing to the existence in-that industry of the system by which part of the fisherman&apos;s remunera-tion takes the form of a share in the profits of his fishing. Such a system can only work satisfactorily if the financial results of the voyage on which his share depends are presented to the fisherman in a way which commands his confidence. Unfortunately, owing to the large number of items of which account must be taken, it is very difficult to-devise a form of settling sheet at once accurate and sufficiently simple for the average fisherman to understand. For this reason some witnesses suggested to us that the share system should be abolished and that skippers, mates and crew should all be paid a fixed wage. The-share system is, however, deeply rooted in the fishing industry in this-country. Owners regard it as a valuable means of ensuring that when, fish are found in large quantities the men will spare no effort to secure as large a catch as possible. For their part the men, or the bulk of them, are also attached to the system, believing that it ensures that the harder they work the more they will earn. In the light of the evidence-which we have received we are satisfied that it would be both undesir-able and impracticable to attempt to supplant the share system. We consider, however, that owners should do all in their power to convince the crews of their vessels that they are being fairly treated. It is clear-that in many cases excellent and long-standing relations exist between owners and men. All possible efforts should be made to develop such relations and this object would, we believe, be facilitated if, as the industry becomes more organised, arrangements were made for the-setting up, as has been done in other industries, of some form of machinery for collective discussion between the owners on the one hand, and the men on the other on questions of mutual interest. Owing to the peculiarities of the fishing industry and the diversity of conditions under which fishing is conducted, we recognise that such machinery would not be easily established. We recommend, however, that this question should be further explored by the Fisheries Department of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and by the Fishery Board for Scotland in consultation with the parties concerned.(e) Marketing.(i) The Present Marketing System.68. White fish landed at the large fishing ports is sold by public-auction immediately on arrival. It is bought by port merchants, acting either on their own account or as agents for Billingsgate
merchants. In the former case they may dispose of their purchases in a variety of ways. They may sell it to the merchants at Billingsgate or other wholesale markets, or they may themselves sell it in those markets through those merchants acting on commission for them. Alternatively, they may sell direct to their own customers,, including institutions, hotels, restaurants, the fish-friers and retail shops. The fish may be filleted at the port for sale in cartons, or sold to a curer, a smoker or a salter.69. The merchants at Billingsgate and other wholesale markets in their turn dispose of their fish in various ways. They may sell direct, to hotels and institutions or to the larger retailers and fish-friers : but at Billingsgate they normally sell a small part of their supplies to a middleman known as a bummaree, whose function it is to sell fish in small quantities to small retailers.(ii) Sales at the Port of Landing.70. Methods of sale by auction at the port vary according to port custom, but broadly fish is sold in the following way.71. Landing from the trawlers commences at a very early hour, e.g., 1-80 a.m. at Hull. This work is carried out by shore workers employed by the owners of the vessel, at rates of pay which are, of course, higher than would be necessary if the work were done within normal working hours. Large fish such as halibut, ling, and cod, are laid out on the quayside individually, arranged in sizes. Smaller fish are sorted into varieties and packed in boxes. Certain kinds, e.g., plaice and haddock, are roughly graded as to size according to accepted commercial descriptions. As the fish comes out of the fish-hold in inverse order to that in which it went in, a rough grading in order of freshness is also automatically effected.72. Auctions start at about 8 a.m., the auctioneers selling the catch of each vessel separately on behalf of the owners and the skipper, mate and crew, whose earnings depend, either wholly or partly, upon the amount realised by the catch. It is the duty of the mate to watch the sale on behalf of the crew. At a large port a dozen or so auctions may be going on simultaneously. The bidders consist of wholesale merchants carrying on business at the particular port, representatives of wholesale merchants in the inland markets, and representatives of large retail firms and curers. The lots may consist of a number of large individual fish or a number of boxes of a particular variety and grade. In the latter event the purchaser generally has the option of selecting the boxes he will take at the price he has bid. In this way a further grading by quality takes place at this stage. The purchaser having exercised. his option, the remainder of the lot is put up for sale again. As soon as a lot is sold it is taken away by the purchaser, split by him into consignments corres-ponding to his orders, re-boxed and iced, and loaded on to the fish trains which are waiting on the other side of the market.(iii) Raihvay Transport.78. Generally speaking, fish is carried by passenger train or other similar service, at passenger train rates. It is sometimes carried by goods train where an advantageous goods train service is available. The magnitude and complexity of the task of conveying a highly perishable commodity such as fish from numerous ports of landing to a very large number of consuming centres is illustrated by the following statistics relating to Grimsby. Excluding the special service to Billingsgate, 450 tons of fish are, on the average, despatched daily in 10,000 packages to over 2,000 different railway stations. The daily fluctuations in quantity are considerable. The record at Grimsby was reached on the Wednesday preceding a Good Friday, when nearly 40,000 packages weighing 1,500 tons were despatched by fish train in addition to 8,000 parcels sent by ordinary train direct to-consumers and a large number sent by parcel post.
74. Having regard to the difficulties of the task, the railway services for the transport of fish are admirable as regards speed and regularity. There is, however, room for improvement, in certain cases, in the type of van used for fish traffic. Fish traffic is usually conveyed in covered vans, but open trucks covered with tarpaulins, which afford inadequate protection from heat, are occasionally used, and the type of covered van in which fish is frequently carried is not altogether satisfactory, since it allows the ice with which the fish is packed to melt too quickly. We understand that the designing of a standard covered fish van insulated but not refrigerated is a matter which has for some time been engaging the attention of the railway authorities in consultation with whole-sale fish merchants. We hope that all parties will quickly agree upon the most suitable type, and that a supply of insulated vans will be forthcoming with the least possible delay in numbers sufficient to meet all normal requirements.75. Having regard to all the circumstances, railway rates for the carriage of fish, of which examples are given in Appendix II, Note 5, cannot be regarded as excessive, although they bear more heavily upon the cheaper class of fish which has of recent years been forming an increasing proportion of the total catch. The fish merchants have put forward a request that the railway authorities should reduce the minimum unit of weight charged for fish conveyed by passenger train or similar service from 1 cwt. to i cwt. We do not recommend this, having regard to the fact that when consignments of less than 1 cwt. are forwarded, the railway companies charge either the 1 cwt. rate or the appropriate parcels scale, whichever is to the advantage of the trader. Further, in order to obtain cheap rates, it is desirable that fish merchants should consign fish in large quantities, and any reduction of the minimum rate would be an inducement in the opposite direction. Fish rates are now on a lower basis than those for other perishable traffic.76. The desirability of abandoning the system of prepayment, &quot;which was instituted as a war measure in England and Wales but not in Scotland has been advocated by7 some witnesses and opposed by others. Objections to the present system may arise from firms sending fish, either because they find financial difficulty in prepaying carriage, or because they suspect that occasionally some of the fish they send is not worth the carriage. The financial difficulty is over-come as regards Billingsgate by the fact that every man who deals with a substantial firm there receives his money in 24 hours in the ordinary course, and may have it telegraphed to him if he so desires. Anything that would tend to encourage the sending by rail of fish of dubious freshness is to be deprecated.77. The railway7 companies admit that prepayment was introduced during the Wrar, but they claim that there w7as no understanding that the system would be discontinued after the War. They claim that to revert to the carriage forward system for passenger train traffic would involve them in considerable expense which must be ultimately borne by the consumer, whilst for the convenience of traders they usually grant the facility7 of a credit account where the circumstances justify such a course. It may be mentioned that the subject of prepayment was investigated by the Food Council in 1927,* who reported to the Board of Trade as follows : &quot;Wo do not recommend the abolition of the post-war system of prepayment of freight by consignors of fish at English and Welsh ports, but we think that fishmongers might consider making a practice of ordering all their consignments from one port wholesaler on each day, when, on the whole order, no appreciable saving can be obtained by dividing the orders. This would enable port wholesalers to make up larger consignments and so take advantage of cheaper railway rates on such consignments.&quot;In the circumstances we think that the fishing industry would be well advised not to press for an alteration of the prepayment system.!* Report of the Food Council on Fish Prices, 1927.f Note by Captain Basil Hall. &quot; I am unable to associate myself with this -view.&quot;   (Intld. B. H.)
78, The fish friers attach great importance to the reinstatement of the early goods service which existed prior to the war for fish packed and despatched on Monday mornings which arrived at an inland town not later than 5 r.ai., in time for cooking the same evening. This is a matter affecting an important section of the fishing industry, to which we hope the railway authorities will find it possible to give favourable consideration.(iv) Billingsgate and other Inland Markets.79. The evidence which has been put before us on the subject of inland markets has dealt almost exclusively with Billingsgate, little reference having been made to the other inland markets, e.g., those at Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, &amp;c. Information in regard to these markets would be secured by the marketing inquiry the possi-biiity of which we discuss in a later paragraph (paragraph 130).80. Billingsgate handles between a quarter and a fifth of the total quantity of white fish landed in Great Britain. It is, therefore, of importance to the fishing industry generally that the conditions under which fish is sold in that market should be scrupulously fair as between the senders of fish, the market salesmen and those who buy from them.(a) Comjilaints of Billingsgate System.81. The complaints made to us with regard to conditions of sale at Billingsgate fall under four heads : (a) That the seller of fish on commission does not always return to the sender the actual price at which the fish is sold.(h) That the Billingsgate &quot;Daily Prices&quot; do not reflect with sufficient accuracy the actual prices at which the fish is sold.(c) That the number of bummarees in the Market is excessive.(d) The arrangements for weighing, packing, and grading are inadequate.Sales on Commission.82. The question of sales on commission was exhaustively investigated by the Food Council (see paragraphs (9) and (10) of their Report), who summarised their recommendations in this respect as follows : -&apos;&apos; We recommend that the London Fish Trade Association and other associations of inland market salesmen should so revise their Rules as to make it clear that their members are expected to return actual sale prices when they are selling fish on commission, since there is evidence that the present system can be and sometimes is abused.Merchants at the ports, who are convinced of the need for reform, can establish their own sale agents in the inland markets.If any group or any reputable firm of port wholesalers desires &apos; to take this step, favourable consideration should be given by the market authority concerned to the application for permission to establish a stall in the market.&quot;83. Our endeavours to ascertain the action taken on the Food CounciTs recommendation as to the revision of Rules have led to very disappointing results. Witnesses on behalf of the City Corporation told us that that body has not considered the recommendations which, they pointed out, were addressed specifically to the London Fish Trade Association.84.   Witnesses on behalf of the London Fish Trade Association gave it as their opinion that the recommendation was impracticable, stating their reasons for that view, which were, in essence, mere [5598] d 2
repetition and elaboration of the arguments they had previously put before the Food Council, which that body did not consider as sufficient justification of the practices in question. Although no reference to this particular recommendation appears in any of the annual Reports of the Association which have been published since the Food Council reported, it is relevant to point out that the annual Report of the London Fish Trade Association for 1927 contains the following state-ment concerning the Food CounciTs recommendations generally : &quot;The Food Council have now issued their Report, which, on the whole, has been favourably7 received by the trade and the recommendations regarded as fair to all concerned.&quot;85. The practicability of the second of the Food Couucifs suggestions is, of course, limited by the extent to which, newcomers find difficulty in obtaining stalls in the market. At Billingsgate, for example, the pressure on existing market accommodation renders impossible any addition to the number of stalls. A register of applicants for stalls is kept, and applications are considered as vacancies occur. It is possible, therefore, that a port merchant wishing to establish his agent in the market might experience some delay. Too much importance should not, however, be attached to this difficulty, since we have found on inquiry that during the last five years twelve vacancies on an average have occurred in each year. No payment in respect of goodwill by the new tenant to the old is recognised by the Corporation.86. Another remedy which witnesses on behalf of the London Fish Trade Association mentioned to the Food Council was that any sender could attend the inland market unknown to his agent, check the amounts realised for his fish with the returns, and change his agent if dissatisfied with the result. Such action would, however, be of little value if, as appears to be the case in Billingsgate, the methods complained of apply generally throughout the market and are sanctioned by the regulations of the Association which includes in its membership the large majority of the stallholders.87. The policy of leaving to the salesmen themselves the task of carrying out the necessary reform through their Association must be regarded as having definitely failed, and a remedy must accordingly7 be sought elsewhere.88. As the Food Council pointed out, the root of the complaint lies in the fact that salesmen act both as merchants buying and selling fish on their own account and as commission salesmen on behalf of port wholesale merchants. Such a state of affairs inevitably leads to abuses.89. In the central food markets of Paris, salesmen are required to act as commission agents only and are prohibited from engaging in selling on their own account either in the market or elsewhere. We think that it would be of advantage if there were restrictions on somo-what similar lines in this country and recommend that legislation should be introduced to promote this end. A note on the administra-tion and regulation of public markets of Paris prepared by7 the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is printed in Appendix III.90. A precedent for such legislation is to be found in the horticulture-cultural Produce (Sales on Commission) Act, 1926, which makes it obligatory upon the salesman to advise the sender of the actual price paid or agreed to be paid for the produce. That Act also enables the consignor to require the salesman to produce any records, books, or documents in his possession, so far as they relate to the sale of such produce, for inspection by an accountant nominated by the consignor, being an accountant possessing such qualifications as may be prescribed by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries or in Scotland by the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.
Billingsgate &quot;Daily Prices.&quot;91. A list of &quot;Daily Prices&quot; purporting to give representative prices obtained that,day for different classes of fish in the market is regularly issued by the market authority at Billingsgate. The complaint is made that the prices given in that list are based on inadequate data and do not in fact represent the prices actually obtained. It is suggested that they are inflated in order to enable the retailer to justify his prices to the consumer and also to some extent to make the retailer believe that he has made a better bargain than he really has. This practice has the inevitable disadvantage that the port merchants, and, in the case of the inshore fisheries, the fishermen, are led to believe that they have been defrauded. We think it important both to the reputation of Billingsgate Market and in view of the far-reaching effect of Billingsgate prices on the fish trade as a whole, that the &quot;Daily Prices&quot; should be compiled on a basis which is not open to these objections. If necessary, legislative powers should be taken to see that this is done.The position of Bummarees.92. Complaints were made that the number of intermediaries between the fisherman and the retailer is too large, and special reference was made to the class of salesmen of Billingsgate who are known as &quot; bummarees.&quot; The bummaree performs, however, in the market an essentially different function from that discharged by the large fish merchants. The customers of the latter consist mainly of large retail fish shops and institutions and similar bodies which regularly buy considerable quantities of the same kind of fish. The bummaree, on the other hand, caters for the small buyers in the markets, especially the owners of fried fish shops. Their business is often not sufficiently large to enable them to buy as much (for example) as a whole box of a particular kind of fish. By buying fish from the large wholesalers and splitting it up into small quantities, the bummaree meets the requirements of purchasers of this type who are thus enabled to obtain supplies in quantities suited to their requirements and in the variety required by their type of business. For these reasons, we consider that the bummaree plays a useful role in the market which could not readily be discharged by the large wholesalers.Weighing, Packing and Grading.93. Further complaints had reference to the alleged inadequacy of the arrangements for weighing, packing and grading. There is little doubt that the methods of weighing fish in the whole-sale markets are very casual. By convention, boxes are assumed to hold a certain weight of fish, e.g., 6 stone, but the actual weight of fish depends on the number, size and shape of the fish put into the boxes and of the amount of ice with which they are packed. The rapidity with which catches must be sent into con-sumption allows little time for exact weighing, and the congested conditions at Billingsgate make the weighing of all consignments difficult, if not impossible. Large buyers told us that it was their invariable practice to weigh all fish bought in Billingsgate on arrival at their establishments. The inaccuracies disclosed are by no means always on the side of underweight. Billingsgate salesmen make good all authenticated complaints of underweight.94. Cases of underweight were said to be more frequent with foreign than with British-caught fish. It was also stated that the weights of consignments sent from the ports are more exact than those of consignments sent from inland markets.95.   We think the trade would derive considerable advantage by making a careful study of the steps which have been taken in recent years by other branches of the food-producing industry to improve standards of packing and grading.   There was a consensus of opinion
amongst competent witnesses that the universal use of non-returnable boxes is an ideal at which to aim. One witness supplied us with valuable details of an experiment which he has been conducting in this respect. Their use by the trade, however, is not likely to become widespread until their cost has been materially reduced, perhaps by standardisation and mass production.96. As regards grading, we were told that this is done fairly satisfactorily when the fish is laid out on the quay for the port auctions. It was said, however, that the different grades were frequently mixed by the time the fish reached Billingsgate. Packing and grading are subjects which would repay systematic investigation.(b) The Extension of Billingsgate Market.97. The need for some improvement of the wholesale fish market of Billingsgate has been put before us from various quarters with some insistence. The question has been the subject of investigation and comment by public bodies on various occasions for a considerable time past. As long ago as 1882 the City Corporation set up a supplementary market at Shadwell, but their attempt to go outside the existing area at Billingsgate, as also the proposal of the public inquiry at the Guildhall in 1907 to &quot; dismarket Billingsgate market and to utilise the site at Shadwell or elsewhere,&quot; was opposed by the trade as being &quot; in the nature of a public calamity and an irreparable injury to the fishing industry throughout the United Kingdom,&quot; a clear expression of the hostility which will always be felt towards any suggestion of a removal which conflicts with the many vested interests attached to the present site. Mr. Asquith in 1905, the Ministry of Reconstruction and the Board of Trade in 1919 and a Committee of the Ministry of Food in the following year all condemned with equal conviction &quot;the existing chaos,&quot; and emphasised &apos;&apos; a need for better facilities such as it is impossible to exaggerate.&quot; These judgments have been endorsed by the resolutions-of private bodies such as the British Trawlers&apos; Federation, the Hull Fishing Vessels Owners&apos; Association, and others.98. The market which is owned and controlled by the Corporation of the City of London, stands on a site of about an acre on Thames-side, a little below London Bridge, and is a considerable factor in the distribution of fish in England and Wales, for more than a quarter of the population are supplied from it. The total annual volume of trade is round about a quarter of a million tons. Of this total 27-9 per cent, came in 1928 from Scottish ports, 50-5 from English ports (Hull being the largest source with 12-5 per cent.), 8-5 per cent, came by water from the North Sea-Fleet, and 13&apos;1 from foreign sources (some of which is delivered by water).99. For the last 20 years it has been apparent that this very considerable volume of trade has outgrown the normal capacity of the market. Traffic is of necessity handled between the hours of 5 a.m. at the earliest and 10 a.m. at the latest, and although the Corporation has expended, from time to time, on road widening and other improvements, a sum amounting to more than one million pounds, congestion in the approaches of the market is acute during the hours of business. Within the main building there has undoubtedly been a serious lack of space causing congestion, delay and expense. The salesmen&apos;s stands are only 8 feet wide and the gangways between them no wider. Congestion is also felt on the quay-side where cargoes of fish arriving by water are unloaded. In addition, porterage charges are increased to the purchaser by the necessity for parking his vehicle at some distance from the market in order to leave free access for the delivery vans of the salesmen.
100. Three possible solutions of this problem have been proposed : (1) The provision of a subsidiary market within the London area;(2) The transfer of the market to a new site, preferably in thevicinity of the great railway terminuses; (8) The extension of the market in its present situation.101. Of these methods the first has already been proved unworkable, for when many years ago a subsidiary market was set up at Shadwell, the fish merchants refused to divide their attention and their trade between two markets. A central market, unless unified, is meaningless, and since the merchants remained at Billingsgate, Shadwell was discontinued owing to lack of support.102. The second suggestion had the support of the majority of the Committee appointed by the Ministry of Food immediately after the- war. There are obvious arguments in its favour. The advantages of a position which allows delivery by water have been considerably reduced by the decline in the tonnage of water-borne fish from 72,000 tons out of a total of 246,000 in 1910 to 20,000 out of a total of 258,000 in 1980. It must be observed that this downward trend may be due in some degree to the imperfect facilities for landing fish at Billingsgate and cannot therefore be used without reserve as an argument against any attempt to improve them. It is, however, undeniably more important that the market should be easy of access to goods by rail. From this standpoint Billingsgate is situated in a fairly central position, being within a mile of three of the principal stations. But it seems probable in view of the congestion of traffic to which we have already referred that the market would be more efficient if it were placed so as to have direct railway access. On the other hand there are great practical difficulties which would have to be overcome as well as real sacrifices of capital to be made before the market could be removed from a site to which so many interests are attached.103. There remains the third alternative of extension on the present site. The only practicable suggestion is that the City Corpora-tion should acquire the site of the Customs House, the latter being removed elsewhere. This, if done, would double the present area of the market and treble its river frontage besides allowing the widening of roads in several places. This scheme has been accepted in principle by the City Corporation and negotiations have been in progress for a number of years between the Corporation and the Office of Works, but they have come to nothing through failure to agree on the price to be paid. The Corporation contend that since it will not be long before the Customs require newer and larger premises, the Government should take this opportunity of disposing of the site on the basis of a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The Government Departments concerned do not admit that there is any immediate necessity for a change in the situation of the Customs, and refuse to part with the site and remove to other premises except on terms which would involve no expense to the Exchequer.104. It is no part of our province to attempt to, pronounce on the merits of a dispute, which has hitherto been unresolved, so far as it is merely a question of the terms of a commercial bargain. It is, however, part of the argument of the Corporation that the improve-ment of the market would benefit the fishing industry and be of advantage to the nation as a whole, and that on this ground the Office of Works ought to be accommodating in the matter of price. This seems to us tantamount, in effect, to a claim that the national interest in the extension of Billingsgate is sufficient to justify an element of subsidy from national funds, and we have to consider how far such a claim can be made good. We have to decide whether the undoubted importance of the market is not merely a public interest of the locality to which it belongs, but is also through its
effect on the fishing industry, a matter of national concern. We must,&apos; however, first take note of a point less general in character. The desirability of some degree of national assistance towards a scheme for the improvement of the market depends not merely on the importance of the market, but also on the merits of the scheme suggested. It is of little value to consider whether the object is of national importance if the method is of questionable wisdom. If the transference of Billingsgate market to a new site having direct railway access represented a clearly preferable and feasible alternative, the case for the principle of subsidising the extension of the market on its present site would fall to the ground. We are doubtful, however, whether an alternative site could really be found which would on a balance of considerations be more satisfactory than the existing one. In view, moreover, of the sacrifice of capital and connections which would be entailed, we are satisfied that the transference of the market to another site is not a feasible proposition. The extension of the market on the Billingsgate site thus holds the field as the only practicable plan for dealing with the present congestion. Unless this plan is adopted, it is in our judgment virtually certain that nothing else will be done, and that the congestion will continue indefinitely. Accordingly, after careful consideration of the whole case, we have come to the conclusion that the extension and remodelling of the market on its present site and on the adjacent site now occupied by the Custom House is the. right course to take.105. We now return to the more general question.of the public importance of the object which would be served by the extension of the market. In their evidence before us, the Markets&apos; Committee of the Corporation repeated emphatically the claim which they had made to the First Commissioner of Works, that the improvement of Billingsgate is a matter of national importance. Their ground for this claim was that &quot; Billingsgate has for many centuries been known as the public market for the reception and distribution of the fish of Great Britain and as such is invaluable to the fishing industry.&quot; This statement is one with which we would hesitate altogether to agree. The market deals, it&apos;is true, with a substantial volume of business, and improved facilities would benefit not only the wholesalers who use the markets, but also the population of London and the Home Counties-who are supplied by it. Whether the advantages would extend further than this is to some extent doubtful. We do not feel convinced that the fishing industry as a whole would stand to gain substantially, and the markefs claim to be of general national importance is therefore open to question. But, this is not to exclude the possibilitj&apos; of some claim to state assistance. It is an integral feature of public policy in connection with roads, bridges, and harbours, to lend support to useful schemes of development, even when their utility is mainly local. In this case, moreover, the locality in question is the metropolis and contains a substantial part of the total population. It should not, indeed, be supposed that the scheme would be of more than problematic value as a contribution to the diminution of unemployment, as its value for this purpose would depend upon the work being undertaken in time to meet the present depression, and this is not likely. But it would be sufficient to show that, like by-pass roads or new bridges, the scheme-is a useful and a necessary one.106. Even from this standpoint, however, it is necessary to consider certain objections. There are clear signs that the importance of the market as a part of the system of distribution is gradually diminishing. Not only is Billingsgate losing ground relatively, but, in addition, new and important developments in methods of marketing may be expected to encroach still further on its position.107. It will be seen from the Table given below that, while the trade of the market has remained fairly constant during the last twenty years, it has not kept pace with the increase that has taken place in the population of London and the Home Counties, which is the area it serves, nor with the rise in consumption of white fish in the United Kingdom generally.

No earlier roturns available. 1 Provisional llgure.New conditions and new methods are having their effect. We may mention, for example, that gluts of fish from the North Sea and other home waters, which are habitually sent to Billingsgate to meet the London demand for fish of this kind, are becoming less frequent. It is more often the fish from distant grounds, such as the newly-discovered Bear Island fishing that are landed in excessive numbers, and these, owing to the distance they have travelled, are not sufficiently fresh to be readily saleable at Billingsgate. Again, various methods are making their appearance which reduce the importance of the wholesale market in the system of distribu-tion. To a growing extent retailers throughout the country obtain their supplies direct from the merchants at the ports, and this has considerable advantages for the retailer both of cheapness and convenience. In addition, the practice is gaining ground of filleting fish before its despatch from the ports. The principal advantage gained is a reduction of bulk amounting to as much as 50 per cent., but it may well lead to a degree of standardisation sufficient to induce purchasers to buy packets of fillets under the trade name of the producer, relying on his reputation rather than on personal inspection through the medium of the wholesale market. Similarly, an extension of the practice of freezing, at present confined practically to salmon and halibut, may result in the bulk of fish being dealt with in large cold stores, the sale at the markets taking place by sample only. The extent to which these changes will affect the market must be a matter for serious consideration.108. The foregoing are the objections which can be urged against the claims of the extension of Billingsgate to represent an object of public importance. We have endeavoured to give due weight to them, but we are unable to regard them as convincing. In the first place it is possible that it is just the overcrowding of the market that is responsible for the failure of Billingsgate to obtain its share of the increasing volume of trade. It would be paradoxical to urge the evil as an argument against the application of a remedy. Moreover, whatever the percentage of the Billingsgate tonnage in the general course of trade, the volume of that tonnage shows no sign of diminution, and has, in fact, been fairly constant for twenty years. It is this tonnage which overtaxes the capacity of the market and it is the congestion which results from it for which a remedy is sought. The problem is therefore an actual one. No doubt there is good evidence that it will not grow so long as the market remains as it is; and therefore in an industry where all else is tending to grow its importance will become relatively smaller. But the absolute dimensions of the problem remain. For these reasons, we consider that the case is made out for the principle of public [5598] kVolume of Fish Sold at Billingsgate in Period 1910-30, in Relationto Population.
assistance for the extension of Billingsgate Market, though such assistance should not be on a larger scale than that given by the Government for the development of other public utility undertakings.The acceptance of this principle should make it easier to settle the terms of the long-standing disagreement as to the price to be paid for the Custom House site.(v) Allegations of Profiteering.109. From time to time allegations have been made with regard to profiteering, the control of markets by means of rings, and the deliberate dumping or destruction of quantities of fish for the purpose of keeping up prices. In particular, considerable publicity7 has been given to the disparity between wholesale and retail prices of fish.110. The discrepancy between the index number published by the Ministry of Labour for retail prices of fish and the index number for retail food prices generally led the Food Council to carry out the detailed investigation which is described in their Fifth Beport (1927) to which reference has already been made. Their comparison brought up to date to 1930 gives the following result: Table III.Comparison of Retail Fish Prices with Retail Prices of Food as aWhole.	-Retail Price of Food	Ketail Fish	as a whole.	Prices only.	July 1914 ^ 100.	July 1914 ^100.1920	256	2141926	164	2191927	160	2151928	157	2111929	154	2141930	145	209111. It will be noticed that retail fish prices are still over double the pre-war level and only a little below the level of 1920. The gap between the two sets of figures is steadily widening.112. Difficulty arises in comparing wholesale and retail prices by reason of the absence of reliable data. A simple comparison of the price charged for a particular species of fish in a fishmongers shop with the average wholesale price realised for that kind at a port or inland market is misleading for several reasons. Only a comparatively small proportion (estimated at 30 per cent.) of the white fish landed in this country is marketed through the agency of fishmongers&apos; shops. Of the quantity consumed in this country, the largest proportion estimated at 50 per cent. is distributed by fried-fish shops. Some fish is distributed by hawkers either in a fresh state or in fillets, while some is bought direct by hotels, restaurants and public institutions. Some is sent direct to meal and manure factories either because it has been condemned or is too small or of too poor quality to be worth marketing; some goes to the curer or smoker; some is exported either fresh or cured or smoked.113. It would be quite impossible to split up the average wholesale price at the ports so as to arrive at a figure applicable to that part of the catch which finds its way to fishmongers&apos; shops. But even supposing this could be done, further difficulties would remain owing to questions of size, of quality (depending to a large extent upon the number of days the fish has been caught) and even of shape.114. A witness from a firm owning over 300 retail fish shops and several fish restaurants produced for our inspection specimens of the different classes of fish which he had bought at Billingsgate on the morning of the day on which he gave evidence, together with
vouchers showing the prices he had paid for the different categories. In the case of one kind, plaice, the prices varied according to the size, quality and shape (which has an important bearing on the net weight when the fish is filleted), from 4s. to 12s. 6d. per stone.115. A further consideration which is sometimes lost sight of when comparisons are made between wholesale and retail prices of fish is the very large wastage due to cutting up. For instance, the head of a 14-lb. cod weighs as much as 5 lbs.116. The only satisfactory way of determining whether undue profits are made in the selling of fish is to conduct a detailed examination of the accounts of a sufficient number of merchants at each point in the chain of distribution. This was done as recently as 1927 by the Food Council. They examined 245 trading accounts which can be - classified as follows: port wholesalers, 45, inland salesmen, 59, retail fishmongers, 141 (made up of 103 private traders, 27 limited companies and 11 co-operative societies). In their report they pointed out that the fish which is sold in the fishmongers&apos; shops bears an invisible load of services rendered subsequently to landing, payment for which is included in the retail price, and gave a cost structure showing the nature of such services (see Table V on pages 25 and 26 of the Food Council&apos;s Report) (Stationery Office Publication 1927).117. The general conclusion of the Council was that the examination of traders&apos; accounts did not disclose any ground for believing that excess profits on the average were being made in the trade, though well-placed shops with satisfactory turnovers made exceptionally good profits, particularly when managed by the owner. The Council also found that there was no foundation for the allegations of deliberate waste or destruction of fish for the purpose of keeping up prices.118. We see no reason to question the Food Council&apos;s con-clusions on these points or to suppose that they are inapplicable to-day, though, no doubt, in conditions of glut a certain amount of fish is destroyed which cannot be sold at a remunerative price or perhaps at all.(vi) Advertising.119. An advertising campaign known as the &quot;Eat more Fish&quot; campaign has been in operation since 1929. It was inaugurated by the British Trawler&apos;s Federation; and financed by means of a levy of Id. in the pound sterling on the value of the fish landed by the vessels of those owners (about 80 per cent, of the total) who have agreed to support the scheme. The funds so raised, amounting to about  43,000 per annum, have been used to finance a carefully-planned press advertising and general publicity campaign designed to educate the British public to a better knowledge of fish as a food, and the best method of utilising the numerous kinds of fish which are available daily.120. The Government through the Empire Marketing Board has rendered assistance to the industry in connection with this advertising campaign, and has, in addition, advertised fish by means of posters displayed on stands throughout the United Kingdom, in the street and in Elementary Schools, by the issue of books of recipes for cooking fish, and by the production of a film illustrating in detail the day-to-day life on board a herring drifter.(f) Imports of White Fish.-121. Imports of white fish take two forms, (1) landings direct from fishing grounds from foreign fishing vessels, (2) fish imported as cargo, which may be either in a fresh or cured state.   The
following are the figures of these different classes of imports in 1930, the figure of British landings being added for purposes of comparison : 	Quantity.	Value.	Cwts.

Of these, however, the plaice, which was mainly of Danish taking, was the most valuable, being worth  359,529, as against  298,742 of the cod, and  166,309 for the haddock. Of the total landings reckoned by value, 38 per cent, were made by German vessels, 38 per cent, by Danish (including 18 per cent, by Icelandic) vessels and 10 per cent, each by Swedish and Belgian vessels. The following table shows how the landings from fishing grounds were distributed in 1930 among the principal British ports.Table IV.Foreign Landings of White Fish at Principal Ports.	Quantity.	Value.

Of the white fish imported as cargo in a fresh state, about 60 per cent., reckoning both by quantity and value, came from Den-mark (including Iceland and Faroe). Substantial imports also came from Norway and the Netherlands. As regards kinds of fish, plaice was again the most valuable import (208,670 cwts. at a value of  713,904). Other important kinds were cod (227,553 cwts. at a value of  306.226) and haddock (116,139 cwts. at a value of  282,161). The imports of cured white fish came mainly from Norway (303,000), but there were also substantial imports of cod from Newfoundland and Labrador ( 141,000).123. It will be observed that the total retained imports of white fish amounted in 1980 to a value of over  3 millions, as compared with British landings of  14f millions. Before the war imports of white fish were on a comparatively small, though growing, scale, but as will be seen from the table in Appendix II, Note 6, while British takings were actually less in 1928 than in 1910, imports increased over this Period four-fold. Imports increased most rapidly in the first half of the post-war decade, when British takings were stationary. Between 1926 and 1930, on the other hand, British landings showed a substantial increase, clue in part to the discovery of new fishing grounds, while imports ceased to expand in any marked degree. The total consump-tion of white fish in this country increased steadily during the post-war decade, as the result in part of a shifting of demand from herrings, and
(g) Exports of White Fish.125. The following table shows the quantity&quot; and value of the exports of British-caught white fish in 1930 : Table Y. Exports of White Fish.Quantity. Value.Cwts.  Fresh or frozen   ......      362,000 750,000Cured or salted.....      560,000 1,073,000Total    ......      922,000 1,823,000126. More than half the exports in a fresh or frozen state went to France ( 395,000). This not very considerable trade is now threatened by restrictions on imports which have recently been imposed by the French Government. Of the cured and salted exports, the greater part was accounted for by exports of cod to South American countries, particularly Brazil. In normal times this should be an expanding trade; but it has to encounter at present obstacles arising from the financial difficulties of Brazil.127. Large potential markets for dried fish and fish meal for human consumption exist in Africa and the East; and the possibilities of developing these markets should be considered. We suggest thai; the Fisheries Departments should confer with the Department of Overseas Trade on the question of undertaking special inquiries with this end in view.(h) Canning of White Fish.128. Evidence was submitted to us by the National Food Canning Council as to the benefits to the fishing industry which they consider would accrue from a large scale extension of the fish canning industry in this country.129. At the present time the proportion of the total catch of fish which is canned in this country is very small compared with the proportion that is consumed fresh. The chief canning factories are at Aberdeen, North Shields, Leeds and Lowestoft. The fish canned are mostly herrings and sprats with a very small quantity of white fish which is mainly sold as ship&apos;s provisions. With regard to the former, British factories supply a comparativelj&apos; high-class article which has to compete with cheaper grades preparedcontinued to increase for a considerable period of the present trade depression. But by September 1931, a decline in consumption had become evident, reflected in a marked fall in the quantity of British landings (though not in imports) and a more than proportionate fall in price.124. We are thus now confronted with a situation in which the fish which the British trawling industry can market is substantially below its productive capacity. Orders are no longer being given for trawlers to be built and existing trawlers are no longer being worked at their full capacity. Owing to the unsatisfactory state of the market, British trawlers were unable to take full advantage in 1931 of the recently discovered fishing grounds off Bear Island. The bulk of the imports of white fish, whether landed direct from fishing grounds or imported as cargo, could readily be supplied by the British trawling industry. Plaice, however, constitutes a possible exception to this rule, owing to the large volume and high quality of the imports. In these circumstances we recommend that the question of imposing restrictions on the imports of white fish, which amount to the substantial figure of  3 millions, should be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connection with any steps which may be taken with a view to improving the balance of trade.
in countries where competition for the raw material is less keen. In canning white fish they cater for a luxury trade which does not seem to be capable of great expansion. The Pood Canning Council have in mind, however, a different product, one which would sell at a sufficiently cheap price to compete at home and abroad with, for example, the Californian pilchards. At first sight, of course, the idea is very attractive, as apart from the home market, there are potentially important outlets for canned fish among the native populations of Africa, the Malay States and China, provided a satis-factory article can be offered at a very cheap price. To supplant the cheap Californian pilchard, that has largely captured the market in the East, abundant supplies of fish of the highest degree of freshness would have to be forthcoming at a very cheap price. Only the freshest fish is suitable for canning. In the opinion of the Council, only a very small proportion of the deep sea fish as. now landed at our ports is fresh enough for this purpose. As regards price, we were informed that  3 a ton is the highest rate that canning companies could afford to pay for fish for canning if they are to sell it in competition with the canned Californian pilchard. Since this is not much more than the price usually obtained for stale and under-sized fish and offal used for making fish meal and manure, and since it costs roughly  15 to catch a ton of white fish, it is evident that the development as regards white fish has not yet reached a commercial stage.(j) General Questions.(i) Need for Further Information on Marketing.130. The English and Scottish Fisheries Departments have suggested to us the desirability of a comprehensive survey, to be conducted by specially appointed investigators under the auspices of both Departments into the marketing of fish and fish products in Great Britain.131. The two Departments would confer upon the scope of the inquiry and the general lines to be followed. The investigators when working in Scotland, would keep in close touch with the Fishery-Board and rely upon them for guidance, and when working in England and Wales, would act similarly under the direction of the Ministry. The Deports, which would be issued jointly should, the Departments suggest, be published in an inexpensive form, in order to bring them within reach of all persons who are interested in the subject. The Departments contemplate that, in the first instance, attention would be concentrated upon the markets in Great Britain, but that at a later stage it would probably be found desirable to investigate foreign marketing methods for the purpose of ascer-taining whether any such methods could, with advantage, be adopted in this country.132. Up till now the only branch of fish marketing to be investigated systematically is the Continental market for cured herrings, which has, for many years, been the subject of Deports by an Inspector of the Fishery Board of Scotland. Neither the English nor the Scottish Department of Fisheries has extended its sphere to cover the marketing of fish for home consumption in the same way as the marketing of agricultural produce has been covered by the Markets Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.133. Our own experience in the course of our inquiry confirms the need for the proposed investigation, since we have found it difficult to obtain an accurate picture of the fish-marketing structure as a whole. On the statistical side, in particular, we have found serious gaps in the information available with regard to marketing, the deficiencies there contrasting sharply with the abundance of statistical data relating to production and similar matters.134. The Departments take the view that in existing financial circumstances, it will not be possible to proceed with such an inquiry immediately, but we recommend that as soon as financial conditions permit, a systematic marketing inquiry should be undertaken on the lines suggested.
v&apos;ii) Fish Preservation.135. The total quantity of fish landed from trawlers is increasing, arid, apart from the effects of the present slump, is likely still further to increase with the discovery of new fishing grounds in the neigh-hourhood of Bear Island, but there is an increasing shortage of best quality fish such as that required by the larger retail fishmongers. This is a natural consequence of the development of steam trawling in the direction of long distance voyages. The exploitation of the distant fishing grounds can only continue to be profitable if means are speedily discovered and adopted for preserving the fish from the moment of capture in a much fresher condition than is possible under present conditions.136. This would entail either the discovery of a practicable freezing system capable of being installed on a commercial trawler or the more extensive use of factory ships. Either of these alternatives would necessitate overcoming the popular prejudice against frozen fish which exists at the present time.137. If it becomes the normal practice for white fish to be brine-frozen immediately after capture, it would seem inevitable that the distribution of the catch would follow different channels from those now in use, which have been evolved to overcome the difficulties arising from the perishability of fresh fish. Frozen fish would probably be landed direct into cold storage and drawn therefrom in accordance with the requirements of the market. This matter is discussed at length in a later Section (see paragraph 363 below).138. The potentialities of improved methods of preservation represent, we believe, a subject of great importance to the trawling industry, holding out the possibility of extending the sale of fish by cheapening its cost, improving its quality, and evening out supplies throughout the year. Important scientific work on the fundamental problems underlying fish preservation is being carried out under the auspices of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and we urge that this work should be continued and expanded as opportunities allow. We think, however, that there is both scope and need for work by the industry itself. It would be of great advantage if the industry were willing to co-operate in large-scale experimental applications of the results of research in fish preservation.139. It would, we believe, be a good investment for the industry if, let us say, the British Trawlers&apos; Federation were to establish a Research Association similar to those established under the scheme administered by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Since 1917, with the assistance of the Million Fund, research associa-tions have been established in this way in more than a score of indus-tries, and in many cases have succeeded in securing economics amounting to several times the expenditure of the associations. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research provided both financial assistance at the outset and invaluable scientific advice to research associations; and the co-operation thus established has been found of great value both to the practical man and to the research worker.140. An alternative plan would be to apply to the trawling industry provisions similar to those proposed for agricultural products by the recent Agricultural Marketing Act; that is to say, a Board might be established with statutory powers to impose a levy on the industry for the promotion of research and other matters of common interest.141. In contrast to many industries of less importance little time or thought has been expended by the fishing industry on the application of science. In view, however, of its special characteristics, e.g., the perishability of its product, it stands, we believe, to benefit at least as much as any other industry from new scientific discovery
(iii) New Fishing Grounds.142. During recent years trawling has been an expanding industry. The fleet has increased in numbers and is mainly composed of modern vessels specially constructed for the service. The effects of the general slump in trade are now being felt to an increasing extent ; but until 1931 the increased demand for white fish, due in part to the &quot;Eat more fish&quot; campaign of the British Trawlers&apos; Federation, supplied a market capable of absorbing as much white fish as trawlers could land in good condition.143. The perishable character of fish governs the length of the voyages that the trawlers are able to make. The increased application of science to fish preservation (see paragraph 359) has lengthened and will probably continue to lengthen the period that can elapse with-out prejudice to the saleable quality of the fish, between its catching and its marketing. To some extent, however, the value of these improve-ments has been off-set by the greater distances that the trawlers have now to steam in order to find suitable fishing grounds, owing to the impoverishment of the fishing grounds in the North Sea and to the keener foreign competition in the nearer grounds formerly w:worked by British trawlers. The difficulties that have been raised in recent years in regard to fishing on the Murman coast have also led British trawlers to explore more distant grounds, such as the northerly portions of the Barents Sea. It follows, therefore, that any measures enabling the trawlers more easily to locate their fishing grounds are of direct value to them by reducing the period in any given cruise over which the fishing extends and thus the period between the taking and the landing of the first catch.144. At an early stage of our inquiry, the British Trawlers&apos; Federation drew our attention to the valuable work performed by H.M.S. &quot;Rosemary&quot; in surveying fishing grounds (paragraph 5) and urged strongly7 that further exploratory work for the discover)7 of new fishing grounds should be undertaken. They recommended that a general survey should be carried out between the latitude of 60 degrees north and 75 degrees north, and between longitude 45 degrees west and 55 degrees east. This constitutes a beit, stretching from the east coast of Greenland to the west of Novaya Zemlya. The Federation realised that a survey of so large a sea area could only be carried out over a long period of years. They recommended, therefore, that the survey should be con-ducted in sections, and that the first area on which work should be done was the continental shelf on the north-east of Iceland, which is within the capacity of H.M.S. &quot; Rosemary.&quot; The next area to which they attached importance was that immediately surrorinding Bear Island (which is almost due south of Spitzbergen), and thence eastward and south-eastwrard to Novaya Zemlya. Other areas in regard to which they were anxious to obtain information are the grounds around Jan Mayen Island and the w7aters within the 150-fathom limit on the east coast of Greenland. The Federation impressed upon us that for their purposes existing charts of these regions are inadequate, and they claimed that foreign Governments had contributed more largely than had that of this country to what little is known of these waters. In existing circumstances, it is necessary for trawlers to incur substantial expenditure in time and money to locate even fishing grounds they have already visited. In addition, they point out that in these waters there are none of the normal aids to navigation. In short, owing to the absence of adequate data, the fishing of the more distant grounds is unnecessarily costly.145. We were much impressed with the need for obtaining more adequate data regarding these fishing grounds, and we felt there was substance in the claims of the industry that, having regard to the large sums of capital which they have sunk in the provision of the equipment necessary to explore these grounds, it would be unreasonable to expect them to incur substantial expenditure on a survey, the results of which would be embodied in published charts and thus become available to the whole world. The fact that the areas in which trawlers formerly found their fish were adequately charted by the Hydrographic Depart-ment of the Admiralty gave, in our view, point to the claim of the
industry that similar survey work should be - undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the waters in which the trawlers now find it necessary to work.146. After careful consideration, we accordingly drew up the scheme which was embodied in our Interim Report (Cmd. 3473). We do not think it necessary here to restate in detail our proposals, which were, in general, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should order forthwith the construction of a survey vessel, on the lines of the &quot;Discovery II,&quot; for the purpose of surveying new fishing grounds situated between the latitude of 60 degrees north and 75 degrees north, and between longitude 45 degrees west and 55 degrees east.* We estimated that the cost of constructing such a vessel would amount to  80,000, and that its running expenses would amount to  34,000 per annum. We further recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should announce, on the completion of the vessel, that they proposed to ask Parliament to provide annually this sum in each of the next succeeding five years. The total running cost over the five-year period would, therefore, we calculated, amount to  170,000. If to this is added the cost of the vessel, the total expenditure involved in our recommendations amounted to  250,000, spread as to running costs, over a period of five years.147. These recommendations were accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The new surveying vessel, H.M.S. &quot; Challenger,&quot; was completed in the summer of 1931 and would have been ready to-start the work for which she was designed, in the autumn. As the result of the financial crisis, His Majesty&apos;s Government felt themselves, unable at the moment to incur the expenditure that would be necessary to carry out the survey, though they informed the British Trawlers&apos; Federation that the survey would be proceeded with if the Federation could provide the necessary funds. The Federation were unable to dot this and for the time being, therefore, no fisheries surveys will be carried out by the &quot; Challenger.&quot;148. This is less unfortunate than may appear at first sight, as the progress of the depression has served to diminish considerably the consumption of white fish. For the time being, accordingly, the-existing fishing grounds are adequate to the needs of the trade. Indeed, the discovery of fresh grounds at this moment would only accentuate the condition of over-supply. This, however, is likely to prove a very transient state of things, in view of the long-period tendency for the consumption of white fish to increase. We think,, therefore, that it would be desirable for the work of the survey to be put in hand as soon as financial conditions become somewhat easier and without waiting until there is an actual shortage of white fish.III.-HERRINGS AND DRIFTING.149. Considerable differences of character separate the herring; industry from the type of fishing which we have so far been considering. The principal distinction lies in the different habits of the fish. Herrings are pelagic fish, that is to say they swim at or near the surface especially at night, unlike white fish which live-near the bottom.! Ordinarily they are scattered in deep water, but at certain times of the year they come together in shoals, usually for the purpose of spawning, and are then caught in large numbers in drift nets. These are long walls of netting kept upright in the water by floats on the surface and weights below and allowed to-drift with the tide. The fish swim against them, and trying to force their way through, become fixed in the mesh, their gill covers having; much the same effect as the barb of a hook. Once the fish are caught they are extremely perishable, and the drifter does not usually remain away from port more than twenty-four hours. On her return the fish are unloaded in a round basket stamped officially* Within this sector, the most important unsurveyed areas aro the Continental shelf on the north-east of Iceland, and thence eastward and south-eastward to Novaya Zemlya.t At certain seasons of the year and in certain areas herrings can be caught on the bottom by means of a trawl.

(One eran 8001^811 = 8^- cwts.; -one cran English = 85- cwts.)150. The industry is primarily a Scottish one. Not only does it &quot;cover an extensive coastline and give employment to a large number of persons in Scotland itself, but in addition Scottish fishermen and -curers take a leading part in the English fishings. Its situation and prospects present problems far more serious than those of the trawling industry. While the prosperity of the latter has until recently been growing, the herring industry since the war has had to face a period of low prices, contracted markets both at home and abroad, a decline in the numbers employed, and a general deterioration in the means of production.&apos;(a) Fishing Grounds and Seasons.151. The date of the annual spawning and hence of the fishing -season varies from point to point round the coast and the opera-tions of the fleet, in consequence, fall into certain well marked -seasonal and geographical divisions of which the chief are the Scottish summer and the East Anglian autumn fishing. The seasons may be roughly regarded as following one another in a fairly continuous succession, moving round the coast in a clockwise direction. The fishing begins off the west coast of Scotland in the waters round the Hebrides in the middle of May. In early June herrings are caught in the region of the Orkneys and Shetlands, and then in succession off Wick, Fraserburgh, Peterhead and the Berwick .and Northumberland coast. About the same time the herring fishing season begins at Hartlepool and North Shields. After an inter-mediate fishing at Scarborough and Grimsby in August and September, fishing begins at Yarmouth and Lowestoft in early October, and the last herrings to be caught in British waters are caught off Devon and Cornwall in December. There is a certain amount of winter fishing mainly from December to February (see paragraph 155). Thereafter it diminishes, until in April it reaches almost negligible proportions: but the months of March, April and May are virtually a close season for British caught herrings.152. The two principal fishings are the Scottish summer and the East Anglian autumn fishings. The Scottish summer fishing is prosecuted from about the beginning of June until some time in September, chiefly in the area from Shetland to the waters off the coast of Aberdeenshire; also off the Berwickshire and Northumberland coasts, and in the Minch and other Hebridean waters. In addition to the Scottish fleet, some 250 English drifters take part, working mostly from Berwick in Shetland. Other ports which play a prominent part are Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Wick, Stronsay, Stornaway, Mallaig, and Oban. The summer fishing usually accounts for some three-quarters of the year&apos;s total herring catch in Scottish waters.158. The East Anglian autumn fishing is conducted off Yarmoiith and Lowestoft during the months of October and November, and is by far the most important of the English herring fishings. The following figures of the landings for 1980 show the extent to which the position of Yarmouth and Lowestoft overshadows that of all other English ports.Table VI.Landing of Herring at Principal English Ports in 1980.Cwts.
154. The Yarmouth fishing (and curing) is mainly in Scottish hands. Of about 700 drifters at the Yarmouth fishing in 1930 over 500 were Scottish. The above table shows the extent of the winter fishing on the south and south-west coast, which, as we have already explained, succeeds the autumn fishing off East Anglia. As will be seen, this is carried on chiefly from Plymouth, where there are usually from 50 to 60 East coast drifters at work.155. Winter fishing in Scotland, which until recently was of considerable importance, has greatly declined in the last few years. It is carried on from December to March, mainly during January and February, in the Minch and off the North coast of Scotland. Herrings are often caught in great abundance, but not of a quality which is in much demand for curing for export. Winter fishing has at times been attempted in Shetland waters, but although herrings are apparently plentiful, the weather is usually stormy, the danger of loss of gear is great and the demand for the catch is poor.156. From January to March there is a fishing on a smaller scale in the Firth of Forth and adjacent waters. The number of vessels engaged is rather less than 200, the majority being motor boats belonging to neighbouring districts.157. The only other Scottish herring fishing of importance is that in the Firth of Clyde area, including Loch Fyne. This is carried on throughout the year provided shoals can be found. The fishery is liable to great fluctuations, the most productive months in recent years having been between October and February, especially December and January.(b) Personnel and Equipment.(i) Fishermen and their Earnings.158. The number of those employed in the herring industry has-declined in a marked fashion since pre-war days. There is no doubt-that the hard times through which the industry^ has been passing have discouraged the younger generation from entering it, and the average age of the fishermen, especially in some of the smaller creeks is-fairly high. It is probably in this way rather than by the transference of men to other industries for which, indeed, there is little-opportunity that the numbers of those engaged in the industry as a whole have declined from 20,500 -in 1914 to probably under 16,000 to-day.* The herring fisherman, especially in Scotland, suffers from his isolation. In England the fishing is concentrated on one or two large ports, and the boats are mostly owned by companies on shore, so that both harbours and fleet belong to economic units of sufficient size to protect them to some extent from the effect of temporary fluctuations. But the Scottish herring fisherman, like the inshore fisherman in England, lives in small scattered communi-ties never rising above towns of 12,000 population, and as a general rule the men of these communities show great reluctance to fish co-operatively, though in the actual prosecution of their calling; they give one another whole-hearted assistance, when necessary, even at the risk of their life. In the main each boat stands by itself,, and there is no pooling of results and no possibility of a loss on one boat being balanced by the success of others, as in the case of a company owning a number of vessels. This is, however, mitigated to some extent by the fact that a small number of individuals, mostly persons on shore, have a share in several boats. The men are also extremely conservative. The most serious limitation, for example, of the possibilities of the new type of motor drifters fitted with semi-diesel engines, with which experiments are being made, lies in the fact that the fishermen are prejudiced against change, and in the lack of men sufficiently skilled to act as drivers and mechanics. Their spirit of independence is fostered by the organisation of the industry. The profit-sharing system prevails both in England and in Scotland, but in the latter country, the fisher-men are usually also the owners of the nets and the boats.   Even in* Those figures were furnished to us by a trade witness, no official figures-being available in this form.

As will be seen from this table the shares of the men in England are allotted in certain customary proportions! according to the functions which they discharge.* The fraction of j represents a charge made to cover the cost of the -capstan and life boat.f These vary slightly from place to place.England, however, where the men are share fishermen pure and simple, and the boats are owned by companies or persons ashore, the working of the system implies that the fishermen are more exposed to the effects of industrial depression than are ordinary wage earners, just as, it must be remembered, they make more substantial gains in times of prosperity. Nevertheless, the system is of value in giving the men a personal interest in the success of the voyage. This is particularly necessary7 in the drifting industry; for not only are the boats away from the home ports and out of control of the owner (where they are shore-owned) for months on end, but the irregular nature of the herring fishermen&apos;s work also makes some such stimulus necessary. Whereas on one day the nets may be practically empty, on another there may be a heavy catch which requires anything up to 20 hours&apos; work to handle, and it is only because their earnings depend upon it, that the men can be persuaded to undertake it.159. In England under the share system the owners of the drifters provide all necessary gear, and the cost of provisions is included in the deductions for expenses which are made before making payment to the crew.160. From the gross earnings (i.e., the amount realised by the .sale of the catch at the port) are deducted : (i) Running expenses (excluding cost of repairs and overhaul)which usually amount to between  20 and  30 a week and include the cost of coal, water and engine stores, of salt and basket measures, &amp;c.(ii) The cost of provisions for the crew.(iii) Commission to salesmen, and dock dues, paid at the ports.161. The net earnings thus arrived at are then divided, the normal basis of division being that the crew obtain 7/16 less 1/9* leaving for the owners 9/16+1/9. From their share the owners have to meet charges for gear and maintenance, repairs, insurance and depreciation of the vessel. The owmers are in the habit of making advances ,to dependants of the crew on account of their share, and should the share actually divided fall short of the amount of such advances, the balance is not in practice recovered, except in the case of skippers and mates.162. The system necessarily results in fluctuations, but the following figures which are average figures compiled from the working of over twenty boats belonging to a single English company during 1926, 1927 and 1928 are useful as a rough indication of the earnings of the English herring fisherman for the six months of the year -during which he is at work.Table VII.Earnings of English Herring Fishermen during a Period of six Months.
164. In Scotland the position is somewhat different in that the fishermen invariably own the nets, and in nine cases out of ten the boats as well. (Only about 10 per cent, of the Scottish drifters are -entirely shore-owned though shore-owners hold part shares amounting in the aggregate to nearly a quarter of the fleet.)165.   From the gross earnings there are deducted (i) Running expenses;(ii) Salesmen&apos;s commission;(iii) A fixed weekly wage to the engineer, the fireman,  and the cook.The residue is divided into three equal shares which go  to the owners of nets;to the crew, other than fixed wage-earners; and to the owners of the boat.It will be seen that most of the men will be members of at least two of these categories and that their shares although called net earnings will be subject to the further charge of the cost of food, and for those who are part owners of the boat and the nets, the upkeep and insurance of the vessel, and the expenses of tanning and drying the nets.166. With the exception of the three members of the crew to whom fixed wages are paid, the men divide the cre\v&apos;s share equally, the skipper, for example, receiving no more than any of the others. The average &quot; crew&apos;s share&quot; per man for six months is said to be about  58, but further sums (against which must be set the expenses of upkeep) are received by the joint owners of boats and nets in proportion to their holdings. The &quot;nets share&quot; per man is placed on the average at  55, thus giving combined sum of  113.167. It should be noticed that one of the effects of the profit-sharing system is to put all fishermen, other than those in receipt of fixed wages, outside the scope of the National Unemployment Insurance Scheme. But recent legislation has enabled the fishermen to participate in the National Health Insurance and the Contributory Pensions Scheme. Fishermen who are remunerated by fixed wages -enjoy the benefits provided by the Workman&apos;s Compensation Acts, and under the Act of 1925 the Secretary of State has power to make an -order bringing within the scope of the scheme fishermen wholly or mainly remunerated by shares.-  (ii) Shore workers and their earnings.168. Besides those directly engaged in the industry as fishermen there is a large population dependent on it consisting principally of those employed in curing yards in gutting and packing herrings, of whom the majority are women. As is to be expected, the number of these shows a noticeable decline from the pre-war level.169. There has been a marked drop in the figures of Scottish workers engaged as gutters, packers, kipperers, &amp;c.1913. 1926. 1927. 1928. 1929. 1930. 16,269      9,936      10,318      9,835      9,650      9,519The number of those engaged as coopers has decreased from 2,485 in 1903 to 1,649 in 1930. Boat builders (including repairers and -engineers) specially engaged in the construction of herring drifters have decreased from 2,466 in 1903 to 1,697 in 1930. Against this, it should, however, be remembered that modern steel drifters are often built in ordinary shipbuilding yards. The number of those making nets shows little change.170. The majority of the women employed in the curing yards are engaged not throughout the year, but only for the curing season. They work in crews of three, of whom two are gutters and one is the packer. Their remuneration is made up of (1) &quot; arles &quot; paid in advance, which bind them to a particular curer for a season ; -(2) a small weekly wage as a retainer; and (3) a rate of so much per
asbarrel of herrings gutted and packed: with (4) an alternative rate per hour for other work required to complete the curing. The standard rates for the Scottish summer and the East Anglian autumn fishings in 1980 are shown in the following Table : Table VIII.Standard Rates of Pay of Gutters and Packers during ScottishSummer	and East Anglian Autumn		Fishings in	1930.-	&quot; Aries.&quot;	Weekly Wage, j	Rate per Barrel.

A large number of women, for example, are drawn from the outer Hebrides,  travelling  expenses  being  borne  by  the   curers,   and accommodation being found.   This applies even more completely to-England, where the curing is clone almost entirely by Scottish workers.172. The following Table (Table IX) shows the numbers of Scottish workers engaged in gutting and packing during each of the various seasons, together with their earnings : -Table IX.Numbers and Earnings of Scottish Gutters and Packers in 1980..

The pursuit of the shoals rarely takes the boats-more than 60 miles from the port from which at any moment they are-working, * so that the type required is not as large and powerful as-the trawler whose voyage may last a month. Drifters are of three kinds, steam, motor and sail, but of these the last named has almost entirely disappeared, its place being largely taken by those of the second class, in many cases a simple conversion being effected by installing motor-engines in the old sailing boats. This, however, has not proved entirely satisfactory in practice, as the sailing boats were built with considerable width of beam (about 24 feet) and, while this is of advantage for easy handling in a sailing boat, with mechanical propulsion it has the opposite effect.175. We have been furnished by a witness with the following figures of the number of vessels and their total and average individual value in 1914 and 1928.* This is hardly ever the home, port to which the vessel actually belongs, which is used rather as a base for laying up, refitting, &amp;c.

It will be seen that the numbers of the fleet have declined from 3,121 in 1914 to 2,142 in 1928, but owing to the rise in the number of motor vessels of greater efficiency than the old sailing vessels, the productive power of the fleet has not declined propor-lionately, and although it is said to be gradually decreasing owing to the deterioration of the vessels and gear, landings were appreciably higher in 1929 than in 1926 (increase for Scottish summer and English East Anglian fishing 367,950 crans).177. It is clear, however, that the catching power of the fleet -cannot be maintained for long under existing conditions. An analysis -of the Scottish steam drifter fleet shows that out of a total of 334 steel vessels, two were built in 1894, 84 were built either in or before the year 1906, while 43 are post-war. The 84 vessels which are 26 years old or more are certainly obsolete, and they amount to about one quarter of the total number of steel vessels. Wooden drifters number 488, and of these 1 was built in 1892 and 294 were built in or before 1910. The life of a wooden drifter is not as long as that of a steel one. If we take it as 20 years, on this showing more than half the wooden drifters are obsolete. There has been very little construction in recent years, and the numbers of the fleet would be smaller and its average age higher, but for the fact that a number of drifters were built for the Admiralty during the war and afterwards sold to the fishermen. Of the English herring drifters which number 409, 128 are steel vessels and 281 are wooden. Of these, 69 steel and 210 wooden vessels are sixteen or more years old, and are therefore approaching obsolescence.178. In addition to the steam drifters. which are about 75 to &apos;91 feet in length, or on an average 85 feet, there are two classes of vessels engaged during part of their time in herring fishing, one class, the drifter-trawler, being larger than the ordinary drifters and, as its name implies, engaged in trawling during those parts of the year in which herring fishing is least profitable.179. These vessels, the largest type of steel herring drifter, are usually fitted for trawling at Christmas and continue trawling from Lowestoft, Padstow, Milford, and Pleetwood until the end of May, when they return home, take in their gear, and proceed North for the Scottish herring season. Some, however, keep their trawling gear in until early September, and are then fitted out for the East Anglian herring season. About 60 Lowestoft drifters are at present fitted up as drifter trawlers. They carry a crew of nine men, who are remunerated on much the same system as a trawler&apos;s crew, the skipper and mate being sharemen and the remainder receiving a weekly wage. We were informed in evidence that English drifter-- owners who contemplate building new boats are disposed to favour the drifter trawler type, although it costs some  &apos;8,000 as opposed to  6,500 for an ordinary first-class drifter.180.   In Scotland these boats do not appear to be so popular. Alore favour seems to be given there to the second of the two kinds -of dual-purpose boats to which we refer above (paragraph  178).* The reduction in value in 1928 is due to depreciation and to the slow rate -at which replacements have taken place since the war.
This is an intermediate size of motor boat of from 40-50 feet keel, with single or twin engines of about 50 h.p. a speed of up to 8-knots, and five or six men as crew. These vessels can be employed in drift-net fishing for herrings and can also be turned to other fishings, such as herring or white fish seining or small-line fishing, but they are naturally handicapped when the weather is rough, or the shoals of herring are at any great distance from land.181. The other important item of the fisherman&apos;s equipment is-the nets. The cost of these, like the cost of boats, and of supplies, is high, and there are many men in the Scottish herring industry whose resources if not actually mortgaged already, do not allow them to put anything to reserve, or to do anything to replace their&apos; nets as they wear out. While boats probably7 seldom remain idle for lack of gear, there is no doubt that the condition of the nets is deteriorating and in existing conditions will continue to do so. In the great gale off Lowestoft in 1920 enormous damage was done to-the nets. The calamity was sufficiently large to attract public attention and help was given on an ample scale. Smaller emergencies, however, such as are of more frequent occurrence, find: many of the men ill-prepared to meet them.(c) The Productive Power of the Industry.182. As in the case of so many other industries, especially those-relying to any large extent on export, the War destroyed the equilibrium between the productive capacity and the extent of the-markets of the industry. The rapid expansion of the fleet in pre-war years caused by the introduction of mechanical propulsion, was continued to some extent by the building of drifters for the Admiralty. At the same time continental markets were disorganised. The Russian market for cured herring was completely lost and has never been regained, though the Russian Government made-substantial purchases in 1924 and 1929 (see paragraph 207). Besides the dislocation caused by the War the embarrassment of the-industry has been intensified by the marked fall in. the home consumption of herrings. The last twelve years have, therefore, been full of difficulty. In 1919 and 1920 His Majesty&apos;s Government came to the relief with a guarantee to stabilise the price of herrings at 45s. a cran, and although at first the arrangement was actually profitable to the Exchequer later on in the next year the cost became prohibitive, and the subvention which had by. then amounted to-. 1,700,000 had to be withdrawn.183. In the following table in which customs figures have been used- where indicated, other figures being those of the English and&apos; Scottish Fishery Departments we attempt to show what proportion of the total supply of herrings, whether British or imported, is exported cured or fresh, and in this way7 to arrive at an estimate of the home consumption of herrings.* We thus obtain a summary of production, consumption, imports, and exports in the British herring industry. Such an attempt is rendered difficult by the fact that herrings when salted are not identical in weight with the same-number of herrings when fresh. For the purposes of this table, however, we have assumed that the salted herrings contained in one-barrel weighed 300 lbs. when fresh.* In compiling this table we have ignored the small quantities of cured and salted herrings imported from the Irish Free State and elsewhere, which in 1928 amounted to less than 150,000 cwts. Part of this supply is subsequently re-exported.

From the table given above it will be seen that landings have increased during the last few years, though they are still roughly 20 per cent, below the pre-war level. The money value of the catch has not fallen proportionately, but in relation to costs there has been a change, for if the gross earnings of drifters are no lower the cost of building, equipping, and running drifters, is 60-70 per cent, higher. The net earnings of the fishermen are therefore lower.185. The seasonal nature of the herring fishing necessitates the preservation of the greater part of the supply by various methods of curing. In Scotland the percentage of the local supply that is cured for export is especially high, the number of barrels amounting to 1,000,000 annually. The proportion is lower in England, where the market for fresh herrings plays a more prominent part. The following is an approximate analysis furnished to us by a witness of the distribution of the catch between the different products, with a description of the method of preparation employed in those months of the year in which herring is principally cured (June-November).Production, Imports, Exports and Estimated Home Consumption of Herrings in the Periods 1911-13, 1927-29.

The position of the herring industry would be much less serious than it is, were it not that, in addition to the contraction in exports (which constitute its chief market), there has been a decline in home consumption also. In fact, if the home market had been maintained at the level of the years immediately before the war, the -excess to-day in capacity for fishing would be relatively small. Since there are several incalculable factors involved in estimating the future demand overseas for herring, it becomes all the more necessary
to examine with close attention the causes of the decline in home consumption and the prospects of a recovery in it.187. In the last twenty years the consumption of fresh fish has increased slightly. When the character of that consumption is investigated, it appears that there has been a marked shifting of demand from herring to white fish, so that the increased supply of the latter to the households of the country has been very largely at the expense of the former. As in several other cases, statistics of the home consumption of herring are, to some extent, incomplete. Nevertheless, the calculation given in paragraph 183 above shows how striking the decline in the consumption of herring has been; and these figures, when related to the increased population, show a. remarkable decline in the consumption per head.Table XIV.Estimated Consumption of Herrings per Head in Great Britain.

These figures shown an average decline in home consumption of 4-5 lb. per head, when the three-year periods 1911-13 and 1927-29 are compared, or over 35 per cent. This decline was continuous until 1927, when it seems possible that it may have been arrested, but it is-too early to determine whether the slight recovery of 1928 and 1929 will be maintained.189. The decline in the consumption of herring is not only remarkable, but is apparently anomalous when the prices of herring are compared with those of the species of white fish which may be taken to enter into competition with it. The increase in the wholesale price of herring (as compared with that in 1913) from 1928 to 192&amp; was 46-4 per cent., although that of the cheaper kinds of white fish was 61-1 per cent. In 1927, 1928 and 1929 the increases averaged 40 per cent, for herring and 59 per cent, for cheap white fish.Table XV.Percentage Increases since 1913 in Wholesale Prices of Certain kinds of Fish.- 	1923.	1924.	1925.	1926.	1927.	1928.	1929.Herring	25*	79	66	35	49	30	41Cod, haddock, hake, plaice	85	72	50	54	47	62	68* In this year the quality was poor and the price low.Retail prices show a similar relative advantage in favour of herring according to the records of the Ministry of Labour. In the three years 1927, 1928 and 1929 the price of fresh herring averaged 118&apos;7 per cent, above that of 1918, kippers 108-7, while the figure for cod, haddock, hake and plaice was 115&apos;7. Strictly speaking, retail prices are not really comparable, since the demand is more exacting now than in the pre-war years.   Thus, in the case of herring, larger fish are required.

The average for the former was 117 on the above basis, that for fresh herring, 105, and for kippers and bloaters, 101.190. These figures show that the relation between the prices of fresh herring and kippers, as compared with those of the cheaper kinds of white fish, cannot have been (lie determining factor in the decline in the consumption of herring and the increased consumption of white fish. On the basis of the changes in both wholesale and retail prices herring should have gained, whereas it has lost ground as contrasted with the position of white fish which can be substituted for it.191. It appears that there have been a number of other causes all operating together to restrict the home consumption of herring. A generation ago the inland population in the poorer districts, especially in Scotland, depended very largely on herring for its fish supply. The barrel of salted herrings was a usual feature of the humbler pro-vision shop. This has gradually disappeared. The fish hawker distributed fresh herring and kippers over the whole country, and he, too, has almost disappeared. Transport facilities, especially in the form of &quot;bus services, have made the competition of white fish more effective. Changing social standards have their influence, perhaps in this case a determining one. The fresh herring is undoubtedly cheap, and its very cheapness appears to militate against the demand for it when the general standard of living is rising. In this respect it is somewhat unfortunate in its capacity for self-advertisement by the smell of its cooking. This is.a special disadvantage in flats in cities, and the increase in the number of people living in flats has aggravated the difficulty. Then, again, the great development in the preparation of foodstuffs has made people less willing, than in the past, to tolerate the exceptional number of bones to be found in the herring. White fish is provided filleted, but the so-called filleted herring has had only the back-bone removed, and there are often enough other bones left to cause complaint by purchasers. Again, the growth in the turn-over of fried fish shops contributes towards restricting the demand for herring, since this fish has not, so far, been found useful in that trade. The explanation given by the fish friers is that the herring is dark in colour when served to their customers who, for this reason, cannot be convinced that the fish is fresh and therefore refuse to eat it. Another difficulty may be that it does not seem possible to use the same fat for frying hen-ing and other fish.192. The herring is of excellent food value and is relatively cheap. Many people appreciate fresh herring, and this consideration suggests the question whether the decline in the consumption of herring is capable of being arrested and whether some recovery of the lost home consumption is possible. In considering this question, there is one characteristic of the industry which is notable. The British herring industry has been always predominantly an export trade. Accordingly, the home market in fresh herrings has been very largely left to itself. On the other hand, the market for white fish is predominantly in this country and it has been developed with great vigour. The making of its product more marketable and the advertising of it have been pro-secuted very strenuously. It seems not unreasonable to conclude that some part in the decline in the consumption of herring has been the result of a transfer of consumption to white fish, which trade has gained accordingly. In other words, some of the increase in the consumption of white fish has probably been at the expense of that of herring.
Apart from changed social customs, one cause of this gain has been the greater adaptability of the white-fish industry in meeting demand and in improved marketing. As compared with white fish, now that salt herring have almost ceased to be consumed in this country, the herring comes to market under different conditions in so far as the supply is seasonal. The kipper, it is. true, is preserved, but the type of preservation-tion does not extend the herring season to any material extent. It is obvious that the seasonal character of the supply of British-caught fresh herrings is a disadvantage as regards advertisement, since the element of continuity cannot be attained. On the other hand, the herring should have some advantages at the beginning of the season as introducing variety into the kinds of fish available. Also, in view of the attention now being paid to the effects of various foods on health, the herring is in a favourable position on account of the high proportion of vitamins it contains.(ii) The Kippering Industry.193. The kippering branch of the industry has been affected by many of the conditions already mentioned, particularly those of a social nature. The competition of white fish to the disadvantage of kippers is marked in the case of the introduction of wet cod fillets, cleaned and ready for cooking, and also of smoked cod fillets. The kippering firms complain of a contraction in the industry, and it appears that 1929 and 1930 were years of poor demand. There are no figures available for the production in England, while those for Scot-land given below show a contraction (except-in 1927) as compared with the three years 1921, 1922 and 1923.Table XVII. Number of Cruns of Herring Kippered in Scotland.1921 ...... 174,494 1926 ...... 137,1221922 ...... 161.675 1927 ...... 174,0441923 ...... 176,280 1928 ...... 148,3651924 ...... 155,869 1929 ...... 127,0461925 ...... 145,102 1930 ...... 116.050194. Some of the causes alleged for the arrested development of this industry are the improved preparation of white fish for sale, the high rate of the profit required by the retailer, the kippering of Norwegian herring in the latter part of April and May when the fish are in poor condition thereby spoiling the market for good kippers when these are available, and the comparatively recent introduction of an artificially coloured kipper (&quot;the dyed kipper&quot;) concerning which there is much controversy within the trade. The last development distinguishes the position of the kippering industry from that in fresh herrings. It represents a definite effort to make the product of the former industry more marketable by improving its appearance. Whereas the kipper, smoked by the old method, is of a dull and rather unattractive colour, the dyed kipper is a glistening golden fish.195. The questions which arise are of a nature which call for further inquiry. The colouring process is claimed to be completely innocuous to those who subsequently consume the kippers, but, related to it and to a considerable extent no doubt occasioned by it, there has been a change in the materials used for the process of smoking. In order to test the method at present employed and, further, taking into account that it is altogether empirical, a series of investigations has just been begun at the Torry Research Station. Aberdeen (paragraph 365). A smoking kiln has been built in the laboratory -at the present stage a reduced copy of that in ordinary use. It is so constructed that temperature can be regulated, and a series of experiments has been devised to obtain the effects of smoking at different temperatures and also of different materials for pro-ducing smoke.   Since haddock can be obtained continuously the
experiments so far have been confined to these. Obviously, when preliminary data have been secured, it will be necessary to continue with herring. The ultimate result aimed at will be the discovery of the exact scientific explanation of the kippering process. Arising out of that, either or both of two important results may follow, first, an improvement in the process itself, and, second, the chance that means may be devised by which the kipper can be turned out so that it will keep in first-class condition for a longer period than at present.196. The existing process is capable of preserving the fish in an edible state for a period that varies according to the temperature and other conditions from about a week to ten days. But the consensus of the opinion of the trade is that the flavour deteriorates after about four days. Later than this, the kipper becomes dry and hard after cooking. It is clear that this time is too short to secure the maximum demand which is possible. Theoretically, if the whole distributive system works at express speed and if the final purchase and the cooking are also quick, it is possible for kippers to come on the table still in good condition, but at many points delay is likely with the natural result that the quality of the cooked fish is considerably below the best. In fact, it was stated by one trade witness that in London hotels he never got a good kipper.197. In these circumstances the discovery of a method of kippering by which the essential quality of the fish could be preserved for a considerably longer period, would be of the greatest importance to the industry, and the various experiments in kippering at the Torry Research Station are deserving of all encouragement. In fact the results which may be anticipated from these inquiries constitute the natural correlative to what the trade has done itself. The economic significance of the &quot; dyed &quot; kipper is the attempt to improve the appearance of the commodity to be offered for sale. As already indicated there are doubts in some quarters as to whether this has been attained without detriment to the quality of the fish. At an early stage of the inquiries described this question should be settled.198. There remains a problem much more important. To make the goods, offered for sale, look more attractive is something. But in articles of food the essential matter is the quality of the goods themselves, and as a result of the experiments suggested there is a reasonable probability both that the kippering may be improved and that the period during which the fish can be consumed in first-class condition will be lengthened. The development of improved methods of kippering will, however, be of little use if the public taste for this commodity is destroyed by the marketing of inferior cures, as we believe to have been to some extent the case in recent years. The establishment of a national system of grading and marking under the recent Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Amendment Act, 1931, should do much to overcome this difficulty by enabling the public to discriminate between good and bad cures.199. These problems are in turn related to the question of advertisement. There is reason to believe that the consumption of kippers has suffered from the competition of white fish in various forms. Since the war the home consumption of white fish has been gaining on that of herring. It is possible that this tendency has received some further momentum from the advertising campaign of the British Trawlers&apos; Federation. It is therefore desirable that the kippering industry should not lag behind in the matter of advertising, if the true aim of such a campaign is to be achieved, namely7, the expansion of the demand for fish as a whole rather than the transfer of demand from one section of the industry to another. Moreover, if the developments, which have been indicated as possible, are actually realised, advertisement would then be necessary and the industry would be in a strong position to reap the full advantages from it. When that stage is reached it would be a matter for consideration whether it was desirable to impose a compulsory levy on the kippering industry for the purpose of advertising kippers in the same way as is prescribed for agricultural products under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931.
(iii) The Canning of Herrings.200. Amongst the many disabilities to which the herring has become subject in the home market, there is one which stands out as most readily capable of remedy. The market has been invaded by other competing products which have been greatly improved from the point of view of the demand, but the herring has remained comparatively stationary in the form in which it is offered to prospective purchasers. There remains a comparatively recent development towards meeting this situation, namely, the tinning of herrings. The demand for tinned foods has been increasing in view of the many and varied advantages that they offer. Serious efforts have been made by the herring trade to participate in this trade. Tinned herrings, if well established in the home market, would meet the objection, which is so frequently heard, as to the smell of cooking the fresh fish. Also it would get rid of the difficulty already mentioned of the bones. Then, too, it would bring great benefit to the industry by distributing the consumption over the whole year and would do something towards filling the seasonal gap, in which if herring are consumed they are usually imported.201. At the present time tinned herrings find their chief market overseas. In 1928 124,000 cwts. of canned herrings were exported, chiefly to West Africa and Australia. There is a large market for herring and other fish canned in tomato sauce in India, Malaya and the Far East, but at present it is supplied by the canning factories in California. Any attempt to get a substantial footing in the home market would involve very keen competition with other tinned products which have been long established. Progress must therefore be slow. At the same time, if costs can be reduced sufficiently (and here the comparison of the price of a tinned herring with a fresh one will be difficult to overcome) and if the appearance of the tins can be made sufficiently attractive, there may be possibilities of very considerable sales. The American and Canadian canning industries have devoted large funds and great skill to the,study of both problems, and to secure a considerable share in the British market for our own tinned herrings will be a task of no little magnitude.202. The British canner has a number of advantages. Copious supplies of his raw material are available, though he is subject to the disadvantage that the supply is seasonal; and. therefore, under existing conditions, the large capital outlay on plant has to earn a return during a part of the year only. In mitigation of this it seems possible that, ultimately, progress in fish preservation might enable him to arrive more nearly at a full year&apos;s working of his plant. At the same time it lias to be taken info account that if fish preservation were to be improved and could be profitably applied to herring, it would be natural for the public to demand the fresh fish rather than the dearer tinned one. Clearly, however, the present method of tinning herring is capable of producing an article sufficiently good for the home market since herrings so tinned are exported to distant countries where they arrive in good condition. At the same time, there is a difference between the two markets. In this country the canner must be able to make his goods sufficiently attractive to prospective purchasers to divert their demand from other kinds of tinned food and even, to some extent, from other fresh fish which is available in the season when fresh herring are not readily procurable.(e) Imports of Herrings.203. The figures of the imported herrings have been set out in Table XII above (paragraph 183). The bulk of the imported herrings arrive in the early spring and are converted into kippers when there is only a small supply of British herrings available for kippering. The imports are thus for the most part not in direct competition with the British drifting industry. As would naturally be expected in view of this consideration, the imports of herrings have declined in recent years along with the decline in home consumption.   Actually, indeed, the
imports of herrings now represent a somewhat smaller proportion of the estimated home consumption than was the case before the war.&apos;204. In paragraph 124 above, we considered the possibility of restricting the import of white fish. It will be clear, inasmuch as herrings are chiefly imported to meet the needs of the kippering industry at a special season of the year, that these imports present different considerations. It is, however, claimed, as we have pointed out in paragraph 194, that the kippering of Norwegian herrings in the latter part of April and May results in kippers of poor condition and thus tends to spoil the market for good kippers when these are available. In so far as this claim is well-founded, the restriction of the import of herrings might be of benefit to the British herring industry. It is, further, claimed that if the price obtainable for herrings in these months were increased by these means, the Scottish drifters might be able to compete successfully in the supply of these herrings, though it may be doubted whether (he Scottish industry could in practice main-tain a supply of sufficient regularity to meet the needs of the kipperers. The above two arguments are not wholly consistent with one another. It should also be remembered that herrings and kippers are largely consumed by the poorer sections of the community. On balance, there-fore, the case for restriction appears to be a weak one.(f) Exports of Herrings.205. In the previous section we have drawn attention to the serious decline in the. home consumption of herrings, and at the outset we pointed out that the special difficulty of the industry lies in the fact that this decline in the home market comes at a time when foreign trade has also suffered a serious diminution. We propose, therefore, to examine the general position of the export market, under three heads : (i) Pickled Herrings:(ii) Red Herrings:(iii) Klondyked Herrings.(i) Pickled Herrings.206. Pickled herrings form by far the greatest proportion of the export trade, and it is here that we have to notice the most serious decline. In pre-war years the Russian export market was pre-eminent in importance; as we shall see its loss is undoubtedly the principal cause of difficulties in the present and its recovery, could it be attained, would bring with it the most immediate improve-inent in the future. The principal markets to-day are Germany, Latvia, and Poland, with others of smaller importance such as Austria, Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, Danzig, Esthonia, Finland, France, Holland, Hungary, Lithuania, Memel, Norway, Roumania, Russia and Sweden, amongst European countries. The United States is an important consumer, but Canada, South Africa and Australia take only small quantities.207. In pre-war years* the principal markets for British-cured herring were Russia, which imported directly 1,100,000 barrels of herrings, valued at  1,625,000, Germany, which took 1,150,000 barrels-valued at  1,650,000, and the United States, which took 100,001) barrels, valued at  250,000. Of the total quantity consigned to Germany 60 per cent, was for re-export, and of this 75 per cent, went to Russia, which country may be estimated to have consumed about 1,600,000 barrels, of British cured herrings. From this it is easy to see the importance of Russia (which included then territories such as* Except where otherwise stated, tho figures quoted for pickled herrings were supplied to us from trade sourcos. Wo have used these in preference to Customs figures for two reasons. In the first place Customs figures of the quantity of herrings dispatchod to each foroign port, give no indication of the ultimate destination of such consignments. The extent and manner in which exports to certain countries are re-exported can only be judgod by thoso actually engaged in the trade. Secondly with regard to comparisons of the volume of exports from your to year, such as that made for Russia, trade figures which rolatc to herrings cured in each season, give a more accurate idea of fluctuations as they actually affect tho industry, than Customs figures of herrings exported within each calendar year.
Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania and part of Poland, which have since become independent). The aggregate of her imports, direct and indirect, was, in fact, estimated at about 70 per cent, of the total British cure. Since the war Soviet Russia, her territories diminished by the States now independent which we have already mentioned, has been only an occasional buyer of moderate quantities at irregular intervals. The following are the figures of British exports of herring to Russia during the last few years :  Table XVIII. British Exports of Herrings to Russia, 1924-29. (Figures Supplied by Trade Witnesses.)(Barrels.)1924 ... ... ...      276,3721925 ... ... ...        59,2001926 ... ... ...        63,3011927 ... ... ...        41,2721928 .... ... ... None1929 ... ... ...        71,766Russian purchases appear to be dictated by political rather than economic motives, and even the satisfaction of her economic needs has to be controlled in accordance with &quot; calculations as to the part which herrings ought to play in the national economy.&quot; This latter fact is of great importance, for in it lies the reason why in the general import of herrings into Russia, Norwegian herrings play by far the largest part. Under ordinary competitive conditions British exporters have nothing to fear. British herrings may be higher in price, but this is more than outweighed by their superiority in quality. Norwegians have, it is true, many advantages. The fjords give them long narrow fishing grounds within immediate reach of the shore, from which they can land large catches at a low-cost. But the fish are large and coarse, and this inferiority is sufficient in most markets to balance the advantage of cheapness (they are roughly half the price per barrel of British cured herrings). A remarkable proof of this is to be found in the fact that in Poland, where for the last three years there has been a virtual preference in favour of Norwegian herrings of 8s. a barrel, they have, notwith-standing, made no progress as against herrings coming from Great Britain. In Russia, however, all imports other than those of producers&apos; goods (e.g., machinery, raw materials, &amp;c), are kept at a minimum. In buying food, quality is at the moment of little importance, hence nearly the whole of that part of their supply of herrings which is not obtained from the fisheries in the Volga and Caspian is drawn from Norway.208. The effects of this state of affairs are not limited to the market in Russia, but can be seen also in Germany, which to a large extent acted merely as a channel for export to Russia, and in the Baltic States, whose political and economic fortunes are closely bound up with events in Russia. Germany has imported since the war an annual average of about 600,000 barrels, valued at  1,200,000. When this figure is subtracted from the figure for pre-war imports given in the preceding paragraph, it will be seen that total German imports have been almost halved, having fallen by 500,000 barrels. The greater part of this decrease is, however, attributable to the face that Germany no longer re-exports cured herring to Russia. This trade represented 45 per cent, of her total pre-war imports. It is clear, therefore, that the consumption in Germany of British cured herring-is at least as large as it was before the war, and, as we show later (paragraph 218), the export of klondyked herrings to Germany for &quot; marinading &quot;* is one of the few consolations of the export market. The Baltic States, together with Danzig (whose import goes mainly* This term is used to describe any process of cooking ov curing fish in vinegar. Marinaded herrings in Germany are subjected to various subsequent troatmonts in order to produce a spocial flavour, as for oxamplo, Rollmops, Bismarck herrings, herrings with mustard sauce or milk sauce, herrings with white wine, Russian sardines, herrings in remouladen and many others.
to Polana), have taken, during the years 1921 to 1928, a combined annual average total of 613,426 barrels, value  1,250,000, rising as high in 1928 as 854,775 barrels (of a value of  1,750,000). Poland&apos;s share in this total has been 338,000 barrels at  690,000 (the corres-ponding figures in 1928 being 523,575 valued at  1,070,000). It is not possible to say how these figures would compare with those for pre-war years in which the exports of these countries were included in the general figure for Russia, but they do represent a substantial volume of trade which has not gone the same way as that with the Soviet. Nevertheless, the latter&apos;s influence acts as a hindrance to any future development in several ways. The operation of the Soviet State Plan restricts the volume of production and exchange between the Baltic States and Russia. Political friction between the States themselves also hinders trade. The Polish-Lithuanian dispute over Vilna, the disagreements over the operation of the Corridor services between Danzig and Poland, and Danzig and Germany, and various other outstanding diplomatic questions all put obstacles in the way of trade revival and development.209. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the export trade up till 1929 showed a noticeable improvement, though this was not main-tained in 1930. According to figures put before us, fishermen caught 367,000 crans more in 1929 than in 1926: earnings were higher by  638,000, and the total cure was increased by 422,000 barrels. Central European markets, with the exception of Finland, were expanding, and benefit had been felt as a result of a considerable reduction in the import duty in Roumania, though in Poland and Finland duties remained high.210. As regards the United States it is difficult to discover any marked trend in the figures, as the market is greatly influenced by the result of the Alaskan fishing. Exports for the last five years to the United States are given in the following Table : Table XIX.Britisli Exports of Herring to the United States, 1925-29. (Customs figures.)Cwts.1925 ........:      ...      101,0261926 ............        85,5811927 ............      102,8341928 ............      168,9871929 ............      110,185The expansion of this trade is hindered by a heavy duty (an increase in which was recently narrowly averted) and by the limited supplies available of the high quality of herring required. Trade with Canada remains small, little headway being made against the competition of Newfoundland and, on this side of the Atlantic, of Holland.211. Owing to a combination of adverse circumstances, the year 1931 has proved almost disastrous, both to the fishermen, and to the curers and exporters. At the beginning of the year the curers and exporters had on their hands a surplus of about 130,000 barrels remaining over from the 1930 cure. Although they formed a marketing organisation for the purpose of taking over and dealing with these stocks, it has not been found possible to dispose of the whole quantity although prices have been reduced to a very low level. Some of the herring have actually gone bad in storage. This surplus upon the market has undoubtedly had the effect of depressing both the demand, and prices, for the 1931 cure. The Scottish season was marked this year by a serious shortage of fish and the landings amounted to only 528,542 crans as compared with 802,500 in 1930. Only 445,697 barrels were cured as against 766,196 in the previous year, and owing to the state of the Continental markets it was found very difficult to dispose of even this reduced quantity. The East Anglian season opened after the suspension of gold payments by this ^country.   In the resulting conditions of uncertainty, curers and
exporters in this country and importers on the Continent were alike unwilling to enter into large commitments. Normally, the whole of the herring business is conducted upon a system of rather long credit. Owing to the impossibility of forecasting the trend of the sterling exchange in relation to the currencies of Germany and other importing countries, dealers have not been willing to give long credit and have indeed found difficulty in fixing prices in any currency for future payments. In addition, trade is being hampered by restrictions placed in Germany upon the purchase of British currency. As a result, although by agreement the start of curing operations was delayed until the 12th October, very low prices have been paid, the average per cran being only about 17s. Gd., which is certainly less than the cost of production. It is certain that very few vessels will show a profit from the season&apos;s fishing. The total catch of the English and Scottish seasons amounted to 1,367,000 crans, valued at  1,680,000 as compared with 1,855,000 crans, valued at  3,029,000 in 1930. The total cure was only 878,913 barrels as against 1,517,443 in the previous year.(ii) Red Herrings.212. A small export trade (6 per cent, approximately of the total production) is done with Mediterranean countries (mainly Italy, Greece and Egypt), and with France and Belgium for re-export to them, in what are known as red herrings. The cost of production is very low, as a low-quality herring is all that is required for the process, and a continuous supply is available from the vats in which they are stored in the first place, but the trade is declining and it has to face special difficulties. It is based chiefly7 on Yarmouth and Lowestoft, from which ports the fish are shipped to agents in the Mediterranean on consignment (i.e., not to meet any special order, but with the general hope of finding a market). Financial uncertainties in these markets make long credits hazardous, and any prospect of improvement in the trade will depend upon an increase of prosperity in the countries with which it is carried on. The following are the figures of the trade with the principal countries and of the duty imposed  -Italy and Sicily, 200,000 half barrels (80 lbs. gross, 68 lbs. net).All duties were removed in April 1980. Greece, 90,000 to 100,000 half barrels (72 lbs. gross).   Duty.1-575 drachmas per kilogramme (including package), equalsabout 2/8cL a half barrel. Egypt, 70,000 half barrels (97 per cent, is low7-grade fish forArab consumption).   The duty, wdnch was increased in March1980 from 5^ to 1H piastres, now equals 2s. 4d. per halfbarrel and has seriously affected the trade.(iii) Klondyked Herrings.213. The klondyked herring trade covers about 9 per cent, of the total production of herrings. The fish are packed with ice in cases, and sprinkled with salt if the weather is warm, or shipped in bulk in trawlers specially chartered for the purpose. The export is almost entirely to Germany, where it is either retailed fresh or sent to factories for smoking and tinning. The ships are usually of German ownership, but there is at least one Scottish firm. The trade, though neither a large nor a growing one, has been of considerable assistance to the industry since the war. It has been greatly stimulated by the development in Germany of marinading  one of the few cases in which there has been an addition to foreign markets since the war. The herrings are put up in tins by German firms at Altona, but a large proportion of the supply of fresh or lightly salted herrings used has been drawn from Great Britain. The figures, which up to 1927 had risen in a remarkable manner, began to fall in 1928 and continued to do so during 1929. It appears that the cause of the decline lay not in any failure of the demand, but in the failure of certain fishings in the Clyde area and elsewhere on the West coast of Scotland. As a result there was an increase in quantity of herring landed by German trawlers during this period,
which shows that the position of Great Britain with regard to this trade is&apos; not very secure. It would not be easy to replace the loss of this market, as the taste for herrings of this kind seems to be found only in Germany. Attempts to establish marinading factories in this country as opposed to supplying material to Altona would be faced with the obstacle of a hostile tariff in Germany as well as the competition of a country well placed for obtaining continuous supplies.(g) The Problems of the Industry.(i) The Disposal of the Surplus for Export.214. Of the questions raised in the two previous sub-sections those relating to the home market for herrings are undoubtedly important and will repay careful consideration; but it is natural that the problems of the export market, to which roughly three-quarters of the total landings are directed, should stand out most prominently. We have already described in some detail the way in which this market has been restricted since pre-war days, adding to the fall of 1,400,000 cwts. in home consumption a further decrease in exports amounting to 1,800,000 cwts., mainly through the loss of trade with Eussia.215. It is hardly surprising that such a heavy falling away of markets, which has not been met by a corresponding reduction in the size of the fleet, should result in low prices and poor returns to fishermen and curers. It is. however, difficult to see how any appreciable addition to the present foreign markets can be secured. National tastes in matters of food, based upon habits, climate, and other conditions change imperceptibly and are not easy to alter. Efforts have been made to increase the sale of pickled herrings in Germany and the Baltic States and to find a market for them in New Zealand, Australia and South America, but so far with little success. Attention has also been paid to advertising but not on a large scale. A levy of a ^d. in the   on all herrings sold for curing, raised by agreement between the majority of the curers and salesmen, produces  1,800 a year.216. Something further, however, is necessary to correct the disproportion between the markets at present available, and the existing catching power of the fleet. Most of the exporters realise fthough sometimes fishermen do not) that it is unwise to export cured herring of inferior quality so as to overload the market with fish for which there is no adequate demand. It is at present almost a regular occurrence for something like 100,000 barrels of herrings to be cured in excess of the quantity that can be marketed at a remunerative price. For these reasons it is desirable that curing should not begin too early or continue too late in the season. The immature herrings which are caught in the earliest days of the season do not keep when cured for more than a limited time and therefore any surplus at this stage has an adverse effect upon the market for herrings later in the year.* Similarly, overproduction at the end of the season means that a surplus remains on the hands of the exporters which must be sold in the following year at a poor price, before the newly-caught herrings can be marketed.217. The desirability of some regulation of the period during which herring may be cured may be judged from the efforts made in the past to secure it. In 1926 an attempt was made by those engaged in the industry to ensure that no fish should be cured before a certain date. It was, however, partially frustrated by the action of one or two curers in Scotland and one importing firm abroad. Two years later the Scottish Fishery Board were asked by the trade to obtain power to fix a date for the opening of the curing season. The Board held an inquiry in Aberdeen and heard the evidence of various associations, including delegates from the ports, but decided in the end not to seek such power.   They felt that it would be invidious for* This objection does not apply to tho special luxury cure known as tho Matje, a roe-less herring selected and cured principally at Castle Bay, Stornoway, and the Shetland fishing.
a Government Department to undertake such responsibility, and that the matter was one which should be dealt with rather by the trade itself.218. We are aware of the difficulties which have in the past defeated schemes which aimed at maintaining prices by the control of production. As such experience has shown, it is essential to secure control of the whole of the production, since in any other event the competing sections profit at the expense of the one upon which restriction has been imposed. In the present instance, however, the British trade is in a very strong position. No other country is so well situated for the marketing of pickled herring3 of the best quality. German and Dutch firms cure a considerable number of barrels, but owing to the greater distances to which the herrings have to be brought, they have to be lightly cured on board the boat immediately they are caught, and then again more intensively after landing. This double process affects the quality, and British herrings easily hold their own. Norway also cures large quantities at a very low cost, but the fish, which are large and coarse, do not compete with the British herrings, except in a market such as Russia, where price is the essential consideration.219. Since, therefore, the sources of potential competition are so few and so inconsiderable, we consider that much would be gained by the exercise of effective control over the production of cured herring in this country. We agree with the Scottish Fishery Board in thinking that direct responsibility for such control should not rest with a Government Department. We consider that the initiative should be left to the trade and that this end can best be attained, while at the same time securing adequate powers of compulsion, by the establish-ment of a Board representing registered producers. These would be the curers and exporters in the area over which the Board would--exercise control. Subject to the approval of the Scottish and English Fisheries Departments, this Board should be empowered to regulate such matters as the periods during which herring may be pickled in Great Britain or in any part of Great Britain, in such a way that different periods hold good for different parts of the country, and to prohibit the export of British herring pickled outside the period prescribed by them. Every carer or exporter of pickled herring -should be required to register as a producer, and the Board should be given power to impose penalties on any registered producer contravening the regulations laid down by them. Further, it should be the function of the Board to provide for the advertisement of pickled herring abroad, to conduct investigations into the trend of foreign markets and to promote research. To meet the expenses involved and the general cost of administration, the Board should be empowered to levy contributions at a fixed rate upon all registered producers. It has also been suggested to us that it might be possible to extend the functions of the Board to cover the catching side of the industry. There is at present no machinery for attempting to co-ordinate the number of drifters fishing at a particular port with the probable demand for herrings at that port, and it is not infrequently found that the fleet concentrated in one district is excessive for the requirements of that district. With the very varying catches obtained in the herring fishing it is impossible to- co-ordinate exactly the catching power with the demand, but if some measures of regulation were found practicable a better return would be ensured for the catcher. It is doubtful whether opinion in the catching -section of the industry is yet ripe for any such measure of regulation, but we suggest that the Fisheries Departments should give the matter consideration.220. We have considered the question whether, in addition, the Board should be given power to administer a system of grading and standardisation to be applied to herring pickled for export. We think that this is unnecessary as there exists already in the trade an elaborate system of grading in relation to the size and condition of the herring which is pickled. The size of the barrel in which herring are packed is in Scotland-prescribed by Act of Parliament, and though not compulsory in England, the same size is universally adopted. Various statutory orders also prescribe the descriptions of herring to which the Government Brand can be applied in both, countries. Although these descriptions are not compulsory for unbranded herring, they have been -adopted as a general custom of the trade both here and on the
Continent and are complied with universally in pickling herring for export. This system works well in practice, the Fisheries Departments having power to make such alterations in the branding regulations as circumstances may from time to time require.(ii) The Age of the Fleet.221. The post-war difficulties of the export trade should be borne in mind in considering a further problem that confronts us in the herring industry, namely, the question of the replacement and repair of the drifter fleet. The bulk of the Scottish portion of the fleet was constructed in the decade before the war, and the average age of the fleet is now between 22 and 23 years (see paragraph 177 above). Moreover, the impoverishment of the fishermen, brought about by the depressed state of the industry since the war, has made it impossible for most of them to maintain their vessels in an efficient condition, and it is only in a small minority of cases that any provision has been made for replacement. It is not possible to estimate precisely the number of drifters that are worn out to-day as the life of a drifter depends to a large extent on the care and expenditure devoted to its upkeep. Each year, however, a number of vessels become worn out, and this process will naturally be accelerated in the near future.222. The same deterioration has taken place in the gear of the fishermen. Not man3&apos; boats, it is true, have suspended fishing on account of want of gear, but, in general, the stocks held by fishermen are definitely inferior, both as regards quantity and condition, to those held prior to the war.223. It has been strongly represented to us by witnesses who have appeared on behalf of Scottish fishermen that State assistance is required for the replacement of worn-out vessels, for the reconditioning of others and for the supply of new nets and gear. This appeal is not supported by the English section of the industry. As we have already pointed out, the organization of the English drifting industry is more centralized in character. The drifters are owned not by the men, but by companies whose resources are sufficiently large to meet the demands made upon them for replacement.224. The plight of the Scottish fishennen deserves sympathetic consideration. But the main difficulty which the industry has to face springs, as we have already seen (paragraph 182), from the excessive catching power of the fleet in the face of marked contraction in the-export market since the war. The loss of this trade may prove to be a permanent factor in the situation, and the chief necessity of the industry is to succeed in adapting itself, little by little, to this contraction of demand. Any action, therefore, which would tend to delay or even to reverse this process of readjustment would be injurious to the prospects of the industry.225. An important matter for consideration is the obsolescence of the fleet, not with regard to age but with regard to the type of the vessel employed. There is little doubt but that the steam drifter which is in general use is an efficient instrument for herring fishing. It is seaworthy, and its engines are strong, simple, and practically fool-proof. But in comparison with present earnings, it is-expensive both to build and to maintain and operate.226. Before the war herring fishing provided employment for drifters for the greater portion of the year, but with the decay of the winter fishing the problem of finding employment for the vessels during the remainder of the year has been increased. In East Anglia the tendency recently has been to construct larger vessels which, out of the herring season, can be employed in trawling. In view, however, of the large fleet already regularly and intensively engaged in trawling, it is doubtful whether there can be more than a limited scope for vessels of this type. The circumstances seem to point to the necessity for adopting a type of vessel less costly to construct and to operate. With such a vessel fishermen while still depending mainly on the herring fishing could prospect and prosecute other fishing without the same financial risks as attend the use of a steam drifter.
227. A return to the old sailing boat cannot be seriously contemplated, and the only practical alternative by which economies can be effected is the adoption of motor craft. Past experience with the large type of paraffin motor fishing vessel has not been particularly fortunate, but this was due to the fact that engines of insufficient power were installed in old sailing boats, and as a result the converted vessels compared unfavourably with steam drifters, breakdowns being frequent.228. During the past two years, however, several types of wooden vessel designed for motor propulsion and fitted with the Diesel type of engine, burning crude oil, having been built for Scottish fishermen. The length of these vessels varies from about 75 feet to .80 feet and their cost from about  3,400 to  4,000. Their running expenses are low and their net earnings have undoubtedly so far given a better remuneratior. to the fishermen using them than that obtained by fishermen using the ordinary steam drifter. Modern vessels of the latter type which are made of steel and have a length of 85 feet, cost about  5,600 to construct, which is more than most herring fishermen can afford. On the other hand, the wooden motor drifter has hardly emerged from the experimental stage, and it is not yet possible to say whether eventually vessels of this type will be able to earn a satisfactory return on the capital invested.229. It must be borne in mind that although for the next two -or three years the wastage in the fleet may not be excessive, nor the effects of its age seriously detrimental to efficiency, the situation may become critical after that lapse of time. The process of wastage may then be so serious as to threaten a serious contrac-tion of the industry. For this reason we think it very desirable that during the next few years experiments with new types of vessel should continue to be made; and as soon as financial conditions permit we think that this offers a proper field for State assistance.230. It is possible that in the future a demand will arise for state assistance in the form of loans tow-ards the provision of new boats. We think that such assistance should only take the form of loans to responsible co-operative organisations of fishermen or to public utility enterprises of an approved type designed to minister to the needs of the different fishing communities.231. Any scheme of wholesale replacement of old vessels by new vessels at this juncture could only tend to increase production and consequently to lower prices still further and intensify the evil effects of the present excess of catching power. So long as the market cannot be increased, it is better for all concerned that there should be some reduction in the number of vessels and men employed, so that a reasonably comfortable livelihood may be enjoyed by those who remain in the industry, than that the great-majority should be condemned to a hopeless fight with circumstances.282. It will be obvious from the foregoing paragraphs that we can see no advantage in any scheme of State assistance towards reconditioning the old boats now in use, nor do we think that it is -expedient to institute a scheme of loans for fishing gear.IY__THE  INSHORE  FISHERIES.(a) Introductory.(i) Diversity of Character.288. Inshore fishermen, if we give the term its literal meaning, .are those who use vessels incapable as a rule of working at a distance from port greater than 10 or 12 miles. But no single type of fishing and no clearly defined class of fisherman falls within the limits of such a description. To a large extent inshore fishing both in England and Wales, and in Scotland, is no more than an occasional -occupation carried on in the intervals of the herring season or, as in the case of Scottish crofter fishermen, of the cultivation of the soil. Even in the ease of those solely occupied in it the kinds of fish which
they go out to catch, and in consequence the grounds they fish, vary considerably at different times. So that the men who for a large-part of the year are fishing close to shore may often go much further afield.234. The problems, moreover, of the inshore fisheries turn very largely upon the question of organisation at ports and the special disabilities which make inshore fishing a declining occupation affect some ports such as Brixham, St. Ives, and Folkestone the boats, from which cover a fairly wide range and would therefore be excluded by such a definition, while they leave untouched a port such as Lowestoft where there are a number of vessels which the definition would include. We therefore prefer to regard as inshore fishermen, for the purpose of this Beport, those who fish by means of second or third class boats and unregistered boats* and in addition to them those who fish from sailing vessels of the first class other than those in the North Sea and those who use motor boats of up to 20 tons. This represents roughly the line of cleavage between the highly organised deep-sea fisheries carried on mainly by means of steam-fishing vessels based on harbours with on the whole up-to-date means for the maintenance of vessels and for the disposal of their catch, and the more primitive forms of fishing carried on in small villages scattered round the coast which enjoy generally speaking few or none of these advantages.235. The boats the inshore fisherman uses vary in size from the small unregistered boat to motor vessels of 20 tons. The smaller boats are owned by one man as a rule and carry a crew of two or three hands paid by a share of the catch. The largest are often owned jointly by two men and the crew may consist of as many as five. They use all the principal methods of fishing  trawling, drifting, lining, and seining; and in addition the special methods employed for obtaining shell fish such as lobsters and crabs on the one hand and oysters, cockles and mussels on the other. But in every case whatever the size of the boat or the method of fishing they are never long absent from port, but as a rule land their fish every day. This is an important feature since the consequent freshness of their catch is the only point at which the inshore fishermen has an advantage over the large steam-fishing; companies. In all other respects he is a marginal producer with little bargaining power: his harbours being numerous are also small, and never wealthy. The facilities they offer limit the size of the boat which he can use and this in turn renders his capacity to fish especially subject to the weather. It is one of the outstanding weaknesses of his position that when fish is scarce and prices are good he lands little or nothing; his catch only comes to market when favourable weather conditions have already brought about a plentiful supply of fish from other sources.236. Ever since the early part of the 19th century when the Harwich smacks which fished the Dogger Bank with lines and brought their catch home alive in the &quot; wells &quot; amidships, began to give place, first to sailing trawlers hitherto confined to Brixham and the Thames, and then to steamers, all of them making longer voyages and keeping their fish fresh by packing it with ice, the inshore fisherman as a producer of fish has been falling into the background. Fishing has had its industrial revolution as have other crafts and occupations. But, perhaps, nowhere else except, in agriculture, has the small producer survived so persistently.(ii) Numhcr of Fishermen and Vessels engaged in the InshoreFisheries.(a) Number of Fishermen. England and Wales. 237. The following table which is taken from the latest Census of Fishing Boats and Fishermen conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1928 gives the number of men engaged in inshore and deep sea fishing in England and Wales in the years 1924 and 1928.* For definition of those classes see paragraph 213 below.

Thus the number of inshore fishermen in 1928, including those only occasionally so occupied, was 12,279 with a further 2,218 who were engaged partly in inshore and partly in deep-sea fishing. It is significant that inshore fishermen thus make up over one-third of the total, although landings of wet fish by them in 1928 were under 21- per cent, of the total landings, the value of their whole catch (including shell fish) was no more than  813,000 as compared with a total value for landings in England and Wales of  13,613,000.239. Comparing the figures for 1928 with those for 1924, we find that inshore fishermen have decreased by 619, and those partly engaged in inshore fishing by 753. The number and distribution of inshore fishermen is examined in greater detail in Appendix II,. Note 3. The statement there given divides the coast into twenty-six sectors and endeavours to give a comprehensive review of the number of fishermen engaged, the number of boats, and the size and nature of the catch in each sector. It would appear from the survey that the north-eastern sector is holding its own; but the sector from the Wash to the Thames estuary shows a decline, the drop in the southern part of the sector being the result of a falling off in the oyster fisheries. From the Thames Estuary right round to South Wales the figures reveal a general depression, particularly in Cornwall. In Wales, where, however, inshore fishing is not of great importance, the figures show little change between 1924 and 1928, but it is possible that those for the latter year have been maintained by an increase in the number of occasional fishermen, e.g., by an accession of cockle-gatherers drawn from among the unemployed miners. The figures for those engaged in cockle-gathering include nearly 500 women. The rest of the coast to the northward shows a tendency to decline, except in the sector to the. extreme North-West where the number of occasional fishermen has increased.240. A comparison of the figures for 1928 with those for 1918 of a more general kind may be obtained by subtracting the decline in the numbers of deep sea fishermen from the decline in the total number of fishermen. The number of fishermen regularly employed in all forms of sea-fishing in England and Wales declined in the period under review by 7,677 men, and of those occasionally so employed
by 3,673, giving a total decline of 11,350. During the same period steam vessels of the first class, which may be regarded as including almost all the vessels engaged in the deep sea fisheries, declined by 338 vessels. Vessels of this class usually carry a crew of eleven men. On this basis the decline in the number of deep sea fishermen may be put at 8,718. Subtracting the latter figure from the total decrease, we obtain a figure of 7,632, which gives a rough measure of the decline in the numbers engaged in the inshore fisheries.Scotland.241. The following figures supplied to us by the Fishery Board for Scotland, give the number of men engaged in inshore and deep sea fishing in Scotland in 1929 and 1930.Table XXI.Number of Inshore and Deep Sea Fishermen in Scotland in 1929and 1930.	1929.	1980.Engaged mainly in Deep Sea		Fisheries   ...	14,212	14,247Engaged  mainly  in   Inshore		Fisheries   ...	10,458	10,076Total    .....	24,670	24,323(b) Number of Vessels.England and Wales.242.

248. All the boats in the above elasses* fall under the definition adopted for inshore fisheries (see paragraph 234 above). Amongst vessels of the first class the definition also includes sailing trawlers other than those fishing in the North Sea, and motor boats up to 20 tons, but it is not possible to separate the figures relating to these vessels from the general figures for the first class.Scotland.244. In Scotland fishing vessels are classified on a different basis from that used in England. In the following table furnished to us by the Fishery Board for Scotland they have been re-classified on a similar basis to that used in Table XXII.Table XXITLScottish Inshore Vessels, 1924, 1928 and 1930.

As we have stated in an earlier paragraph (paragraph 234), we have employed the term inshore fishing throughout this section of our report chiefly as a description of conditions and methods. Much of the fishing, so described is carried on at some distance from the shore, and in pursuit of fish of the same kinds as those brought to port in larger quantities and from greater distances by deep sea fishing; vessels. Inshore fishing of this kind is subject to no special regulation by local bodies. An important section of the inshore fishermen, however, engage in fishing, either for salmon or for various kinds of shellfish, in the course of which they remain within the exclusive fishery limits of this country (that is to say, within the three-mile limit). Sea fishing of the latter kind off the coast of England and Wales is regulated by the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, which gives power to the Board of Trade, subsequently transferred to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, to create Sea Fisheries Districts and to constitute local Sea Fisheries Committees which are responsible for the regulation of each district. In addition, certain functions in relation to salmon fisheries are discharged by the Board of Conservators of Salmon Fishery Districts, the composition and functions of which we describe later (see paragraph 263).* The classification of Ashing vessels is as follows: (a) The First Glass includes all steam and motor boats of 15 tons gross tonnage and upwards and all sailing boats of 15 tons net tonnage and upwards.(b) The Second Glass includes all steam and motor boats of less than 15 tonsgross tonnage and all sailing boats of loss than 15 tons net tonnage but of 18 feet keel and upwards.(c) The Third Glass includes all boats (other than steam or motor) under18 feet keel, except those navigated by oars only and marked in accord-ance with Section 170 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876 (i.e., with the owner&apos;s name and the port or place to which they belong marked on the outside of the stern).
246. Sea Fisheries Committees, of which there are now eleven, are Committees-either of County Councils or of Borough Councils or joint committees of those councils, their form and status varying from district to district. They are composed partly of members of the County or Borough Council, partly of persons known as Fishery members, of whom some are the representatives of the Boards of Conservators of local Salmon Fishery Districts and others are nominated by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Fishery members must not he fewer in number than the members appointed by County or Borough Councils. The Committees obtain their funds by precept on the constituent Councils, the incidence and method of raising these contributions being fixed in respect of each committee by the order creating the Sea Fisheries District. Under the Sea Fisheries Regulation (Expenses) Act, 1930, they may pay the expenses of their members.247. Under the Act of 1888 the Committees are empowered to make by-laws, subject to confirmation by the Minister, for regulating the sea fisheries, including shell fisheries, within their districts; for restricting or prohibiting any method of fishing or the use of any instrument of fishing: for determining the form and dimensions of any such instrument (including the size of mesh); for constituting within their district any district of 03&apos;ster cultivation and for regulating or prohibiting the deposit of any substance detrimental to fish or fishing. Under the Fishery Harbours Act, 1915, Sea Fisheries Committees may contribute to the expenses of harbour authorities within their districts.248. Although, as already stated, by-laws made by Sea Fisheries Committees are subject to confirmation by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, he has no power to initiate by-laws or to revoke or modify those which may have become obsolete. The absence of such power is attended by obvious disadvantages, there being cases to-day in which for one reason or another by-laws have proved unsatisfactory in practice. We therefore recommend that when a suitable opportunity presents itself Parliament should be invited to amend the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, by giving power to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to revoke or modify existing by-laws, and also to initiate such new bj7-laws as he may from time to time consider necessary.249. In Scotland the system under which the sea fisheries are administered is more centralised than in England and Wales, the Fishery Board for Scotland having power to issue by-laws regulating fishing in Scottish waters. By-laws cannot, however, become operative without the consent of the Secretary of State for Scotland. With the exception of the District Boards which control salmon fisheries, no -special bodies exist for the regulation of inshore fishing. The Fishery Board are, it is true, empowered under the Sea Fisheries Regulation (Scotland) Act, 1895, to create, upon the application of local authorities, Fisheries Committees constituted upon the lines of the Sea Fisheries Committees in England. Up to the present, however, only one application has been received, which proved unsuccessful owing to the opposition of the inland authorities of the area in question.(b) Kinds and Quantities of Fish Caught.(i) Demersal and Pelagic.250. The definition so far adopted in the discussion of inshore fisheries is not one which lends itself easily to statistical illustration. Figures relating to the two categories of first class vessels included in the definition of the inshore fishing vessels viz., sailing trawlers other than those in the North Sea and motor boats up to 20 tons  are difficult to obtain.   In Appendix II, Note 4,* we give for six* The figures given in this Note include many men only partially engaged in inshore fishing and therefore do not nocessarily provide an accurate indication of the number of men actually responsible for the landings at each port, e.Q., at Tenby the whole total of fish landed was caught by loss than 20 men.
selected ports a detailed analysis of the kinds and quantities of fish caught in 1929. The ports chosen are representative of varying degrees of prosperitj&apos;, from North Sunderland with (nominally) 70 fishermen where fish was landed of a total value of  17,503 down to Tenby at the bottom of the scale with (nominally) 33 fishermen, where fish was landed to the value of  2,587. In Appendix II, Note 3, we include also a survey for 1928 of the total quantities of fish caught under the general headings, Demersal, Pelagic, &amp;c, and also their distribution between various groups of ports. We give below the total quantities of demersal and pelagic fish caught by inshore fishermen in England and Wales at intervals of four years (excluding 1916) since 1928.Table XXIV.Landings of Demersal and Pelagic Fish by Inshore Fishermen in England and Wales, 1908-1928.Demersal.

The quantity of fish landed in Scotland in 1929-1930 by vessels engaged in inshore fishing is given in the following Table.Table XXV.Landings of Demersal and Pelagic Fish by Inshore Fishermen in Scotland in 1929 and 1930.Demersal. Pelagic. Cwts. Cwts.1929     ...      ...      280,655 339,8051930     ......      346,052 437,961252. The foregoing figures, with the exception of those for Scotland, show clearly the decline in productivity of the inshore fisheries. The figures for pelagic fish, it is true, show fluctuations rather than a definite tendency, but the decline in white fish landed has been continuous since 1920 and amounts to over 30 per cent.253. The comparison of the total landings year by year in England and Wales cannot easily be carried beyond the year 1928, but figures for 1980 covering the bulk of the inshore landings (landings by 2nd and 3rd class vessels and from shore) show the various kinds and quantities of white fish landed. In that year the total of such landings was 140,753 cwts. white fish and 164,188 cwts. pelagic. The principal kinds landed in order of quantity were as follows :- -Cwts.Cod...............      35,596Dog fish     ............      20,899Skates and rays   ...       ...      ...      20,482Plaice ...&quot;      .........      18,816Haddock     ............      14.240The order given above does not necessarily represent the relative importance of the various kinds since some of the fish mentioned belong to the cheaper varieties.

Scotland.255. About 2,000 men are engaged in the Scottish salmon fisheries. These differ from the other sections of the inshore fisheries in that they may only be worked by the owners of the fisheries or by persons holding leases from them. Further, the men engaged are not independent fishermen but are wage-earners employed in the Salmon Season. Less than half of them engage in Sea fishing during the close time for salmon fishing. Thus from some points of view it would be preferable to treat salmon fishing as a class of fishing distinct from the inshore fisheries. Subject, however, to this qualification, we have judged it more convenient to deal with them at this point. Production of salmon has declined greatly in recent years and imports, consisting mainly of canned salmon, but also to some extent of Canadian frozen salmon have been increasing. Imports of the former class do not compete with British salmon owing to the great difference between salmon when fresh and wdien canned. For similar reasons it is doubtful to what extent frozen salmon competes with fresh salmon. In the course of our inquiry it was suggested to us that some system of marking would become desirable as the trade in frozen salmon increased, in order that such salmon should be readily distinguishable from fresh salmon of British taking. This suggestion has now been realised by an order made in 1931, on the application of the Fishmongers&apos; Company, under the Merchandise Marks and Imported Goods Act.256. Salmon is taken chiefly by fly and bag nets set along the shore and to a lesser extent by sweep nets in estuaries and rivers. The general policy in recent years has been towards the limitation of netting any narrow waters, where too great a control of the run of fish may be exercised and the reservation of the rivers for the reproduction of the fish and incidentally for angling. The weight of salmon taken annually in Scotland in recent years has been estimated by the Scottish Fishery Board at 32,000 cwts. Except in a few cases where voluntary returns are made, the Fishery Board for Scotland do not receive any statistics of the catch of salmon and the various District Boards are in no better position. Attention has been drawn in many7 official reports to this matter, which has long been a source of difficulty. Practically the whole of the catch is consumed fresh in Great Britain and there is little export trade.257. In the last 50 years there has been a decline in the salmon fisheries in Scotland, which has been largely due to the operation of the following causes : (i) Pollution, (ii) Over-netting.(iii) Obstructions, such as dams and weirs, which prevent the ascent of the fish to the spawning grounds.258. The first of these is being investigated by departmental committees which have been set up in England and in Scotland and also by the Water Pollution Research Board. There is no doubt that pollution lias had a very serious effect upon the salmon fisheries. In some cases, e.g., in the Clyde and in the Irvine, in Ayrshire the former of these being one of the largest they have been completely-destroyed. The Clyde fisheries have suffered in a special degree from a process which has been going on in a number of estuaries. When crude sewage is discharged from a large industrial centre, the resulting lack of oxygen in the water makes it impossible for fish to live.   It is only rarely, as for example in times of heavy
flood, that salmon oan make their way into the river and ascend it to their breeding places. The stock of salmon in many rivers has dwindled in consequence. Over-netting in the rivers, in former days a serious danger to the salmon fisheries in Scotland, is now much less prevalent. Such restriction as has been effected has been the result of entirely voluntary action. There can be no doubt that important advantages are to be secured. They are clearly illustrated in the case of the Aberdeenshire Dee, where an association of proprietors succeeded in removing nets in fresh water for a distance of about 16 miles. When this was begun in 1872, the total annual rental of the district was  7,000 and the stock of fish was seriously depleted. The Dee is now a well-stocked river with an annual rental of  28,000, and the fish bred there form an important part of the catch of the Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire coast lines. The Tweed, on the other hand, is an instance of a river where no restriction has been exercised. It seems probable that over-netting is at least partly to blame for the decline in the stock of salmon, grilse, and sea trout caught in that river from 160,000 in 1846, to 55,000 in 1885 and 25,000 in 1923. Lastly, there is room for improvement by the removal of obstructions preventing the ascent of the fish to the spawning grounds, whether in the shape of natural waterfalls or artificial dam dikes. Existing Acts require that ladders or passes should be provided for the ascent of the fish, but the schedule of the Act of 1868 indicates one type of pass only, and that, too, one which is not suitable for all forms of obstruc-tion. In modern practice the type of pass considered generally suitable for all obstructions of any height is the pool pass, but under existing conditions this can only be erected in cases where all the parties are agreed upon it and at the expense of those who desire it. The obligation of the owner of the dam or dike constituting the obstruction extends no further than the provision of a ladder or pass conforming to the statutory definition and plans need not be submitted before construction.259. The effective handling of these problems is in our opinion seriously hampered by the inadequacy of the existing powers of the-Scottish Fishery Board. Under the Acts of 1862 and 1868 salmon fisheries are administered by district Boards elected by the fishery proprietors, the Scottish Fishery Board having no more than a general power of superintendence which is expressly declared to be without prejudice to the rights and duties of the district Boards. The Fishery Board has no compulsory powers of any kind and can act only in an advisory capacity.260. In order to remedy this situation we recommend that Parliament should be invited to confer upon the Fishery Board for Scotland powers substantially similar to those already possessed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act, 1923, and previous legislation con-solidated in that measure.   Such powers should include : (1) The general supervision of district Boards, with power to take action when the appropriate district Board fails to do so.(2) The collection of statistics.(3) Power to initiate and direct, local inquiries.(4) Power to conduct scientific investigations.(5) Power to give or withhold approval to plans of fish passes before construction.(6) Power to deal with pollution.(7) Power to make by-laws.England and Wales.261. The salmon fisheries of England and Wales, while not as extensive as those of Scotland, are nevertheless of considerable importance. Broadly speaking, they raise much the same problems, but the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act of 1928 provides legislation to meet these difficulties of a more up-to-date kind than anything so far obtained in Scotland.262. It is not possible to estimate accurately the quantity of salmon taken annually in England and Wales.   No one is under
any statutory obligation to provide returns of the number and value of salmon taken and although a few Fishery Boards have bye-laws requiring returns to be made and a number of others endeavour to secure voluntary returns, it is generally admitted that few of these are either reliable or complete. A rough calculation can, however, be obtained on the basis of the returns of the quantity of salmon passing through Billingsgate market. This averages approximately 850 tons a year. For most classes of fish Billingsgate generally absorbs about one-third of the whole British catch. It is probable that in the case of a luxury fish like salmon, the proportion is rather higher and we therefore estimate on this basis that the English catch of salmon averages between 16,000 and 18,000 cwts. a year.263. Under the Act of 1923 fisheries are in most districts administered by local bodies called Fishery Boards. These are set up under an Order of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and consist of (1) members appointed by the County Council, (2) members representative of the holders of licences to fish for salmon in public fisheries otherwise than with rod and line, (8) members representative of those holding licences to fish with rod and line for fish other than salmon, (4) ex officio members, consisting of proprietors of fisheries or owners of river frontage of more than a certain value. The income of the Boards is obtained from two sources, namely, the collection of fees for licences to fish and contributions by the owners or occupiers of fisheries levied in accordance with assessments made by the Boards themselves. The Boards enjoy general powers for the protection and development of salmon fisheries, including powers to prevent the pollution of rivers, and, in certain cases, of tidal waters and estuaries. In addition they have power to make by-laws for certain purposes, such as the fixing of a close season, the regulation of netting, pollution, &amp;c. By-laws are subject to confirmation by the first-named Minister, who may, if he thinks fit, direct the holding of an inquiry into a proposed by-law.   He may also revoke any by-law.264. The Act contains general provisions designed to limit as far as possible the evil effects of pollution, over-fishing, and obstruc-tions to the ascent of the fish to the spawning grounds. It will be seen that it endeavours to provide the Ministry and the local boax-ds with adequate powers for the meeting of those difficulties which have in the past been the subject of comment by successive inquiries, including the Royal Commission of 1902, and which still exist to-day in the case of Scotland. Although it would not be true to say that the problems of the salmon fisheries have in every case been solved, the Act of 1923 provides the Ministry with adequate powers to deal with them, so far as this can be achieved by Government action.(iii) Shell Fish.265. The fisheries for shell fish no less than those for salmon, discussed in the previous paragraphs, are of special importance in connection with the problem of inshore fisheries. As we have stated above (paragraph 236), the inshore fisherman has for many years been steadily losing ground in the face of competition from modern large scale trawling companies. This is a process which we can hardly expect to see reversed and which will continue to threaten the prosperity of those of the inshore fishermen wdiose livelihood depends principally on the catching of white fish. Fisheries for shell fish, on the other hand, although distributed unevenly round the coast, are still a valuable source of income to those engaged in them. From the survey of inshore ports (Appendix II, Note 4), to which we have already-referred, it will be seen that in every case where a port remains fairly prosperous its success is due in no small degree to the presence of profitable fisheries for shell fish. In these circumstances we think that special attention should be given to the problems and they are not inconsiderable which affect the maintenance and development of fisheries for shell fish.(a) Lobsters and Crabs.266. Lobster fisheries play an important part in the economy of the inshore fisheries both in England and in Scotland where they
are caught mainly by crofter fishermen of the north and north-west. The following are the numbers and values of lobsters and crabs caught in England and Wales and in Scotland in 1930 : England and Wales. Scotland.Quantity.        Value. Quantity.        Value.   Lobsters ...       830,000        58,693 989,542        65,528Crabs     ...     6,377,900       67,988 2,498,786        16,097267. Lobsters are usually caught in creels, or pots, baited with portions of stale fish to which they are attracted by their keen sense of smell. The fishing is often interrupted by bad weather, and the supply is subject in consequence to considerable fluctuation. In order to overcome this difficulty special steps require to be taken for storing the catch. Lobsters are often kept by fishermen in store-pots, but they thrive better in less confined quarters. An interesting example of improved methods of storage may be found in the privately-owned tanks and ponds near Oban at Kerrera and Luing. At Kerrera the owners purchase lobsters from the fishermen on the coast and the islands and sell them to wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. In the interval they keep them in large tanks anchored in the bay which are provided with air chambers so that they can be raised or lowered to any level desired, and to which the water from the bay has free access. At Luing the lobsters are impounded in a narrow channel closed by a dam at each end with gratings to admit sea-water. About 8,500 lobsters are at present stored there in this way. This is perhaps the simplest method of&apos; storage and there is no reason why it should not be more generally-adopted by the fishermen themselves. There are many places on the West Coast of Scotland where natural ponds exist or where small creeks could be converted into ponds at little expense. Work of this kind could be most easily carried out by co-operation on the part of the fishermen. We hope that the Fishery Board for Scotland will continue to impress upon fishermen as they have in the past the valuable part which co-operative action might play as a solution for these and other marketing difficulties.268. In England and Wales lobsters and crabs are to-some extent protected by statute, and in certain localities this protection is supplemented by local bye-laws. The Fisheries (Oysters, Crabs and Lobsters) Act, 1877, prohibits the capture or sale of crabs less than 4j inches across the back, or of lobsters which measure less than 8 inches in length. Corresponding; measures of protection are in force in Scotland. Protection is also given to &quot;berried&quot; crabs but not to &quot; berried &quot;* lobsters, except in certain localities. In England and Wales the Fisheries Department have always maintained that any attempt to protect the latter would lead to an increase in the practice of &quot; stripping,&quot; i.e., the removal of the eggs by the fishermen. They consider that a more effective method is to increase the statutory minimum length of lobsters which may be caught. Before the War the number of lobsters showed a noticeable decline, and in many quarters measures of protection were regarded as urgently necessary. Since the War, however, the figures have remained comparatively stable; indeed, they show, if anything, a slight increase. Of late years the Fishery Board for Scotland have paid considerable attention to the question how best to encourage and develop lobster fishing, particularly on the West Coast of Scotland. Grants have been received from the Development Fund to enable them to carry out investigations and collect statistics regarding lobsters. Some practical results of these inquiries were made available to fishermen in 1925 through the publication by the Board of a pamphlet giving advice on the best methods for use in the catching, storing, and marketing of lobsters. As a result of the 13oard&apos;s activities lobster fishing has now become in many localities as intensive as the stock of fish available will allow. Only in certain districts for the most part on the more remote and exposed parts of the coast could more intensive fishing be pursued with profit. It is, however, doubtful whether further development of these fisheries would provide an*&apos;A &quot;berried&quot; lobster is a fomalo lobster to which eggs arc attached beneath tho tail. From 10 to 12 thousand eggs are carried in this way, which may take as long as 12 months to hatch. &quot; Borried &quot; lobsters are seen in greatest numbers in the spring, but are also captured throughout tho yoar.
opening for more than a limited number of men, and the results would hardly justify the considerable expenditure on fishing equip-ment and transport facilities which would be necessary. The Fishery Board have examined carefully the whole question of transport facilities on the West Coast and have compared the present position with that existing before the War. Their general conclusion is that services are adequate and the charges reasonable, and that the fisher-men are in most cases in a position to secure a fair return for their catch. Considerable improvement has been effected in steamer services on the West Coast, and road transport has been appreciably improved. There, are, no doubt, outlying districts where transport is still a matter of some difficulty, but the traffic in lobsters, and the possibilities of developing it are not such as to justify further considerable expenditure. On the whole we do not consider that any special steps are called&apos; for at the present time.(b) Cockles and Mussels.269. The following are the quantities and value of cockles and mussels of British taking in 1930 : Quantity. Value.&apos;:      CwtS.&apos; :   \ . : :BvV?  :&apos;: V 7Cockles     ...... 186,912 38,499Mussels     ...... 151,783 28,982270. Cockles live embedded about half an inch below the surface in soft sand, the &quot;syphons&quot; through which they draw in currents of water containing food and air protruding slightly above the surface. They are capable of a limited amount of movement from place to place, and are gathered by a hook, a small rake or a hoe. They are then &quot;riddled&quot; (i.e., sorted&apos;according to size), washed in sea water and packed in bags for market. Mussels differ considerably from cockles in their habits. They grow attached to a hard surface and flourish best in brackish water in which the diatoms on which they feed abound. Unlike cockles they are sedentary, being attached to the bottom by means of filaments called the &quot; beard &quot; or &quot; weed.&quot; They are gathered by hand, or where the beds are not exposed at low water, by long rakes with nets attached. Cockles and mussels of less than a certain size may not be gathered in England and Wales, and this restriction is necessary if cockle and mussel beds are not to suffer from over-fishing. In England and Wales mussels are gathered for human consumption, but in Scotland they are used principally as bait for lining fishing.271. By far the most important question in regard to shell-fish is that of pollution. The shell-fish beds in this country are very largely subject to contamination by sewage, and in several places they are virtually closed, so far as concerns distribution of shell-fish for human consumption.   This has been done either (a) by Orders made by Sanitary Authorities under the Public&quot;Health (Shell-fish) Regulations, 1915; or(b) by Regulations applying to particular fisheries, made by theMinister of Health under the Public Health (Regulations as to Pood) Act, 1907.272. The general effect of the Orders under the Act of 1915 is that no shell-fish from the area concerned may be distributed for sale for human consumption unless they have been relaid for a specified time. The effect of the Regulations under the Act of 1907 is similar, except that (in some cases) there is a proviso allowing such distribution if the shell-fish have been subjected to a process of sterilising or cleansing approved by the Ministry of Health with the concurrence of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. &apos;&apos; Sterilising &quot; is a process in which the shell-fish are steamed under high pressure in a special apparatus. The utility of this process is limited, since it spoils many forms of shell-fish. Under the term &quot;cleansing&quot; are included, processes by which the shell-fish are passed through sterilised water. -273. In recent years the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have developed at Conway a method of cleansing mussels which has proved very satisfactory. It consists of a process, lasting 48 hours, in which the mussels are placed on grids in tanks filled with sterile
salt water. The mussels are subjected to two &quot; baths &quot; in this wayr during which, by normal physiological action, they discharge all foreign matter, including bacteria into the water below the grids. Subsequently the mussels are immersed for a short time in sea water containing a minute quantity of active chlorine, mainly for the purpose of killing any bacteria which may adhere to the outside of the shells, after which they are packed and sealed in sterilised bags. The instal-lation at Conway is operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries under special powers. No net expenditure of public funds is involved. Local Authorities have at present no general power to pro-vide works either for sterilising or for cleansing shellfish, though in some places, e.g., at Morecambe, special powers have been conferred upon them under an Order of the Minister of Health.274. Investigations into the condition of shellfish layings are being undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. The situation is one of considerable difficulty, since on the one hand, where shellfish layings are uncontrolled, there is grave danger that typhoid fever may be caused by the consumption of infected fish; on the other hand if layings are closed, a valuable trade is destroyed or damaged in the absence of suitable cleansing apparatus. Moreover, it is difficult to enforce any general prohibition upon taking shellfish for human -consumption.275. Most of the layings conditionally closed are public layings, and the persons who are financially affected by the closure are fisher-men who rely on the -taking of shellfish to provide a part of their livelihood for some seasons of the year. As a rule they would have neither the capital necessary for the construction of cleansing or sterilising works, nor the business experience. required for their management.276. Local Authorities appear, however, to he suitable bodies to undertake the necessary work, which is similar to that which they already perform under the Public Health Acts. Moreover, the-neeessity for rendering shellfish fit for human consumption arises from the discharge of sewage into the river or sea by Local Authorities.277. In these circumstances wo recommend that Local Authorities should be given power to provide tanks or other apparatus, together with all necessary appliances for cleansing or sterilising shellfish, and to charge for their use. Although Sanitary Authorities would normally be the most appropriate bodies for the exercise of these powers, there may be cases in which action would be taken by County Councils, or even by private persons. We consider, therefore, that power should be given both to Sanitary Authorities and to County Councils either to provide the necessary apparatus themselves or io contribute on agreed terms to its provision by some other authority or person. In most cases the money required to meet the expenditure incurred would be raised by borrowing, and it-would be necessary to apply to the Ministry of Health for sanction to a loan. A public inquiry could then be held, if necessary, into the application.278. Further control over the type of process used would be secured by the Regulations under the Act of 1.907 (paragraph 271 above), which require that the approval of the Ministry of Health should be obtained for cleaning processes adopted. This approval could, moreover, be withdrawn at any time if the process were not properly carried out. Inspection of cleansing establishments could be carried out by the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.279. Action by Local Authorities would be facilitated if, as we hope, the Development Commission (who have contributed largely to the cost of the Conway installation) were prepared to recommend an advance from (lie Development Fund (normally by way of loan) towards tho cost of provision in suitable cases, where the Local Authority is unable, by reason of the low rateable value of the area, to borrow on ordinary Local Loans terms, and where there is a good prospect of making tanks pay their way.   Any recommendation of
f.8the Commissioners would require Treasury sanction. Judging by the experience at Conway, it may be hoped that a reasonable charge for use of the tanks should enable Local Authorities to make the installations financially self-supporting within a short time. In areas where the fisheries are small neighbouring Local Authorities might co-operate in the establishment of a cleansing plant.280. We therefore recommend that a Bill should be introduced to give effect to the foregoing proposals in England and Wales. The question does not appear to be one of such urgency in Scotland, but we suggest that the Fishery Board for Scotland should be invited to consider whether similar legislation is desirable for that country.281. The measures recommended above will we believe greatly reduce the danger to public health from polluted mussels gathered in this country. They will, moreover, supply that basis of confidence which experience has shown to be an essential condition of an increase in demand. The position will not, however, be satisfactory so long as foreign mussels imported are not subject to similar control. The imports of mussels (53,058 cwt. in 1930, valued at  13,442), while negligible in relation to the total volume of British imports, represent about a quarter of the home consumption of mussels:,and it is clearly anomalous to take elaborate precautions to safeguard the con-sumer against the clanger of eating polluted mussels, if gathered at home, when no such precautions are applied to the substantial part of the supply which is gathered abroad. The Fishmongers&apos; Company keep a watch on imported mussels marketed in Billingsgate and the surrounding area in London to which their powers extend. They are also frequently consulted by local sanitary- authorities with regard to mussels exposed for sale in provincial markets, and they undertake free of charge the bacteriological examination of samples of such mussels which are sent to them by medical officers of health responsible for the control of such markets. The supervision thus exercised by the Fish-mongers&apos; Company covers, however, only a portion of the supply of imported mussels, and necessarily falls short of an adequate system of control. A drastic but simple remedy might be the prohibition of the importation of mussels, unless subjected to an approved cleansing process after their arrival in this country. It must be borne iu mind, however, that while the greater part of the imported mussels comes from the Netherlands, rather more than one-third comes from the Irish Free State, so that it would be necessary to extend the obligation of cleansing to imports from the Irish Free State, if it were to be fully effective for its purpose. It would, how-ever, be desirable to consult the Free State authorities before imposing such a restriction, and it might be possible for the appropriate departments of the two countries to agree upon mutually satisfactory arrangements which by ensuring the cleanliness of mussels gathered for export might obviate the necessity for any further process of cleansing. We think it the more important, from the standpoint of public health, that there should be adequate, provisions to ensure the quality of imported mussels, in that it is difficult, so long as polluted mussels can be brought in from abroad, to obtain the impetus necessary to provide cleansing apparatus for mussels gathered at home. We therefore recommend that the importa-tion of mussels from foreign countries should be prohibited except where they are subjected to an approved cleansing process after their arrival in this country, and that at the same time arrangements should be made with the Irish Free State which will ensure the quality of the mussels imported from that country.(c) Oysters.282. Although the products of British oyster fisheries stilt command a deservedly high reputation for excellence, a continuous and remarkable decline has taken place in their output in the last thirty years. In 1880 the annual production was estimated at 1,000 million oysters, but shortly afterwards, in 1892, the effects of pollution by sewage began to be noticeable, and rapidly gave rise to the scare which between 1895 and 1905 enormously reduced demand and put out of cultivation large areas of oyster beds. Largely owing to action taken by the Fishmongers&apos; Company, public confi--dence has been to some extent restored, but the output is still
severely restricted, through pollution and the fear of pollution. We understand that a method of cleaning oysters devised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has now reached a commercial stage, and we recommend that the Ministry should consider the practicability of including in the legislation recommended for other shell-fish in the preceding sub-section provisions enabling them to prescribe the cleansing both of native and of imported oysters.288. The decline in production has continued in a marked fashion in post-war years. The following are the numbers of oysters of British taking, from 1921 onwards : 1921    ......	......      81,027,1001922    ......	......      23,666,2001928    ......	......      18,102,0001924    ......	......      16,972,9001925    ......	......      16,740,2001926    ......	......      15,857.9001927    ...	......        9,712,3001928    ......	......        8,057,7001929    ... -     ...	7.377.2001930    ......	......        6,937,400284. Sewage pollution has not been the only cause of decline. The heavy mortality among oysters in 1921 and 1922 was the result of an epidemic, the precise nature and cause of which are somewhat obscure. In addition a destructive pest known as the slipper limpet has done wide-spread damage. Whatever the reasons for this persistent decline in output, there is no doubt that a great deal of ground is being lost to foreign competitors, of which the chief are Holland and the United States. Imports4 of oysters for consumption have increased from about 23,000,000 in 1921 to about 45,000,000 in 1930. In addition 12.350,000 oysters were imported for cultivation purposes in 1930.285. An important element in the decline of British oyster fisheries has been the continuous succession of summers since 1920 in which conditions have been unfavourable to the reproduction of oysters, the beds of which were already depleted by the mortality of 1921 and 1922, particularly in and near the Thames estuary. Good natural spatfalls on English beds are now rare, and young brood has to be imported in considerable quantities from abroad. Considerable progress has been made at the Comvay and Lympstone stations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, in research work aiming at the discovery of a practical method of breeding oysters in tanks (see paragraph 346 below&quot;), and the Ministry hope that the stage will shortly be reached at which the process can be applied commercially7.286. These investigations will undoubtedly prove of assistance to the companies engaged in raising oysters on private beds, but the condition of the public oyster fisheries presents a more difficult problem. The past history of public beds has been one of exploitation for immediate gain, with little regard for future yield. Only those public beds have continued to give a commercial yield which are situated close to leased beds, and wdiich have been saved from complete exhaustion by the timely7 enforcement of adequate control. Though the public beds in this country are, or were formerly, of much greater extent than the private fisheries, yet in comparison, their productivity is small. The oysters obtained are very seldom of marketable size, and are normally sold by the fishermen to the oyster companies who put them down on their own beds and grow them until they have reached the necessary stage of development. The imports of young brood to which we have already referred show that the supplies from the public beds in England are no longer adequate. One of the principal causes of the low productivity of the beds lies in the absence of any hard clean surfaces, such as are provided by clean shells of oysters and other shells (or &quot; cultch &quot;) upon which the young oyster fry in the swimming stage can attach themselves.    Such shells as are present are overgrown with organisms,*&apos; The customs figures were 27,773 cwts. and 54,6C0 ewts. for the years 1921 and 1930 respectively. Those figures have been convertod from cwts. to oysters on the basis that 135 lbs. of foreign oysters contain on tho average 1,000 oysters.
JOand in some eases also covered with silt. It is unlikely, therefore, that falls of spat would occur on the beds in their present state, even if there were a succession of summers in which breeding conditions were favourable.287. The restoration to productivity of public beds, where no leased beds are maintained in the vicinity, involves considerable capital expenditure without any return for several years. An oyster takes on the average from four to five years to grow to a marketable size. Where there are well-stocked leased beds nearby, spat derived from them may be caught in considerable numbers on public beds. The lease-holders would also be ready purchasers of young oysters a year or two old only. With oysters scattered thinly over a wide area a first step would be to build up a concentration of oysters in the most promising spot, due regard being given in its selection to possible recent changes of channels, which might involve silting over or, at times, undue lowering of salinity and to sewage or chemical pollution. In general, an inlet is a better starting place than a wide open area. The bed, which should have a firm gravel bottom, must receive preliminary attention with a heavy dredge to remove for bleaching all old shells, together with mussels and other competitors for food, and &quot; enemies.&quot; Over a large area, the shells to be dealt with would amount to hundreds or even thousands of tons. Where mussels are present, thorough treatment with an agricultural harrow is necessary to get rid of the mud deposited by them. The local oysters could be supplemented by those imported as seed from other localities, provided they are free from pests. Shells removed in dredging are bleached and rendered clean by exposure for some months in the open in heaps which are occasionally raked over, and become excellent collectors. The area of dredging is gradually extended, all old shells are removed to bleach, oysters placed on the beds, and pests eliminated. The bleached shells are returned to the bed as soon as spawning has begun, scattered where the bottom is hard, or placed in wire netting bags. There is con-siderable scope for scientific work in determining the best time and place for shelling, for shells put out too early become dirty and unserviceable for catching &quot;seed.&quot; The young oysters may be sold to lease-holders and transferred to private growing beds, or left to mature for market on the beds. In any case, culling or separation from the culteh shells is necessary, with the ultimate return of the cultch to the beds. Even when a bed is well-established much maintenance is required, not only in dredging young or marketable oysters, but also in cultching and removing pests, whether slipper limpets, mussels, boring whelks, or star-fish. Invasions of star-fish may have to be combated by trailing specially constructed mops over the beds. Maintenance is of great importance if a satisfactory yield is to be realised.288. The problem is thus not merely one of obtaining the capital necessary to give the beds a chance by cleaning and restocking them, but is also an administrative one. Some method has to be found whereby the beds, when resuscitated, can be maintained at a productive level, for, as already indicated, the evidence from past experience is overwhelming that unrestricted fishing, without maintenance, will sooner or later deplete any public bed. The problem of depleted public beds has been dealt with in the United States either by sale outright and subsequent taxing of the beds, or by renting them to private companies, or by the exercise of control under a State Commission. Under such control the best results have followed where the State and oystermen have co-operated in planting shell cultch, the growers contributing by means of a tonnage tax an amount equal to that given by the State. In this case the beds are regarded as held by the State for the oystermen. Where the State alone has undertaken the shelling of the beds, the oystermen regard them as the State&apos;s, and therefore to be exploited to the maximum. In Canada, the Dominion Govern -ment has recently undertaken the restoration of productivity of a small portion of a large area of exhausted public beds as a demonstration, with a view to granting leases ultimately for the remainder of the area. Such a concentration of effort at one point is highly desirable, but in view of the uncertainty of good spatting
seasons and their in frequency at the present time, the prospect in this country of a satisfactory return on the considerable capital involved is doubtful.289. It has been suggested to us that for two or three years the Government should offer a small sum per bushel to inshore fishermen to dredge old shell from the public beds, to spread it out in the sun until it has become bleached, and to replace it on the beds in the summer at the period when oyster fry are in the free swimming stage. This would provide one at any rate of the conditions which are essential to secure a fall of spat. It is clear, however, that such a measure would not be sufficient in itself to ensure the productivity of the beds. If applied to all the derelict public beds it would involve very heavy expenditure in proportion to the results achieved. Attention has recently been drawn to exhausted public beds in East Anglia near the Wash, but it is doubtful if any suitable inlet is available sufficiently-near this extensive area for the establishment of oyster beds therein to have any beneficial effect on production on the public beds. A recent attempt to restore oyster production in an area comparable to the Wash, but more promising for the purpose viz., the bay east of Sylt on the Schleswig Holstein coast has hitherto met with failure to secure any spat.290. The type of oyster culture on small leased beds, which consists merely of growing marketable oysters from seed oysters procured elsewhere is at present ruled out by the difficulty of procuring seed.291. If, therefore, public oyster beds are to be successfully restored, it is essential that they should be placed in the hands of a permanent body by the grant under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868, either of an order for a &quot; several Fishery &quot;* to a private firm or to a co-opera-tive society of local fishermen, or a &quot;regulating order&quot; to local authorities, such as a District Council or a Sea Fisheries Com-mittee, with power to charge tolls, issue licences, and enforce con-servation measures. The fishermen have, however, on previous occasions shown strong opposition to proposals to grant conees-sions to public or private bodies for this purpose in spite of the fact that an area under private cultivation, besides providing employ-ment, is likely to improve the productivity of public beds in the vicinity by a natural process of propagation. At the same time, they themselves have hitherto lacked the experience and the funds necessary for the formation of an organisation capable of maintaining the beds in a productive condition. Until these difficulties can be over-come, it would be of little use to consider the expenditure of public funds on the restoration of these oyster beds.(d) Other Shellfish.292. The following figures give the quantities of British taking in 1980 of those kinds of shellfish not separately considered above : 	100&apos;s .Crawfish	453	Cwts.Escallops and Queens	2,427Norway lobsters	11,770Periwinkles ...	18,004Prawns	429Shrimps	52,596Whelks......	62,009298. Shrimping is of some importance amongst methods of inshore fishing as it gives employment to a considerable number of persons. The shrimp frequents sandy or muddy ground in shallow water, near the coast, and is fished for by boat fishermen, using trawls or similar nets, by fishermen-farmers who fish from carts, and by* A &quot; several fishery &quot; is an oxolusivo right to catch certain kinds of fish in a defined area of sea or other navigablo waters vested in an individual or body by Act of Parliament or ancient charter. A Regulating Ordor can only bo made under the Sea Fisheries Act of 1868 in favour of a local authority and empowers that authority to police and control, by means of liconcos and regulations, a similar area.
longshoremen and boys using push or stake nets. The measure of shrimps for trade purposes is a quart; the price obtained by the fishermen fluctuates considerably, as the supply is to a large extent dependent upon the weather. In addition to the men actually engaged in shrimping, the preservation of shrimps by various methods is an important local industry on the Lancashire coast. An aspect of shrimping of which account must be taken is the amount of destruction done to young fish. The mesh of a shrimping net is necessarily small and very large numbers of immature fish are in consequence found in it when it is hauled on board. Amongst these are, as a rule, several kinds of flatfish, such as dabs, plaice and soles which will survive if thrown overboard at once, but round fish, such as young whiting or codling, are already dead or dying.(c) The Problems of the Inshore Fisheries.294. Some of the witnesses who appeared before us expressed the view that for social and other reasons it was essential in the national interest to maintain the inshore fishermen as a class, even if the development of other forms of fishing, e.g., steam trawling, was tend-ing more and more to undermine their position. In support of this contention, several different reasons were urged. They may be summed up in the statement that the continued existence of a healthy stock of inshore fishermen is of importance to a maritime nation and a naval power. The Navy, the Eoyal Naval Reserve, the Mercantile Marine, and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution were cited as drawing their recruits to a. greater or less extent from the sea-faring population engaged in fishing round the coast. Further, it was urged that this population forms a valuable reserve of healthy and robust stock, whose existence helps to maintain a higher standard in the population generally. On inquiry, however, we found that to-day few of the candidates for the Navy, or for the Royal Naval Reserve, are drawn from amongst the inshore fishermen. Little information is available regarding the extent to which inshore fishermen later take service in the Mercantile Marine. The lifeboat crews are, it is true, still to a large extent composed of inshore-fishermen, but owing to the introduction of motor lifeboats, fewer in number and carrying a smaller complement than the old sailing boats, the total number required to man the lifeboat fleet to-day is probably not more than half that required at the beginning of the century. Finally, from such information as we have been able to obtain, it appears doubtful whether inshore fishermen are now a specially robust stock, though twenty-five years ago, when the drift to the towns was less marked, they probably were. While, however, for these reasons we are of the opinion that the claims put forward on behalf of the inshore fishermen are exaggerated, we should regard their disappearance as regrettable.(i) Marketing Difficulties and the Need for Co-operation.295. The inshore fishermen are severely handicapped by the extreme individualism of their methods, by their lack of capital, and by the small scale on which they work. In considering their position, it is important to draw a sharp distinction between those engaged in obterin-ing kinds of fish peculiar to inshore waters, such as salmon and shell-fish, for which a steady demand may be expected, and the larger number who only catch the same kinds of fish as those obtained in the deep-sea fisheries. Inshore fishermen of the latter class cannot hope to compete on level terms with the steam trawler industry. At Hull, for example, ice is obtainable for 8s. a ton, while at small ports like Brixham it costs 40s. At Hull, fish is loaded at once into a special fish train by which it is taken direct to the inland market. At Brixham, it-has to be conveyed by lorry to the railway station, where it represents only a small parcel for which the rates are higher and the service not so expeditious.296. The particulars given in Appendix II, note 4, for six repre-sentative inshore fishing ports show clearly how restricted is the variety of fish that the inshore fisherman is able to obtain from inshore waters. It is no matter of surprise, therefore, that even in local markets con-sumers are not content to take only the fish caught by the local fisher-
men, when practically all over the country nearly every kind of fish can now be obtained daily, either direct from the principal trawling ports, or from Billingsgate or other inland wholesale markets.297. We have seen in earlier sections of this Report that even in the case of the deep-sea fishing industry, which is to a large extent controlled by companies possessing far greater bargaining power than the inshore fishermen, the system by which fish is marketed is open to abuse. It is not surprising, therefore, that evidence put before us made it clear that the fishermen at inshore ports are often to a large extent in the hands of the local buyers, some of whom determine the price that they will offer in an arbitrary manner, irrespective of the level of prices prevailing elsewhere.298. The natural remedy would be an increased measure of eo-operation on the part of the fishermen, not only in the buying of provisions and gear, but also in the sale of fish. In 1913, the Depart-mental Committee on Inshore Fisheries stated in its report &quot; Co-opera-tion should enable the inshore fishermen collectively to utilise modern business facilities in a manner not possible to individuals; to stand up better in face of competition; to deal on something like an equality with more highly organised or capitalised trades, and where they are unjustly dealt with to defend their own interests either legally or by bringing a more effective pressure to bear.&quot; Since that time, much valuable work has been done by the Fisheries Organisation Society, which was formed in 1914 in accordance with a scheme framed by the Development Commissioners under powers conferred upon them by Section 4 (4) of the Development Act, 1909. Its object is to form local co-operative societies of fishermen, and to act as a centre of advice on all problems affecting the inshore fisheries. The Society has been instrumental in forming 75 local co-operative Fisheries Societies. Of this number, 18 have for various reasons been wound up; but there are still 57 in existence. Of these, however, only 10 undertake the co-operative selling of fish. In England, the total turnover in sales and purchases in 1929 was about  75,000. From 5 to 10 per cent, is frequently saved in bonus on purchases of oil, nets and accessories. In addition, longer credits and reduced prices are obtained.299. The progress of co-operation has been hindered by various causes. Of these, the natural conservatism of the fishermen and their mistrust of anything which appears to restrict their independence, are among the more important. There is, further, a special difficulty in organising co-operative selling by reason of the fact that many of the men are in debt to the local buyers and, in consequence, dare not break away from them.300. A further and important difficulty lies in the inability of the fishermen, with the limited resources at their command, to pay for persons of sufficient capacity and experience to manage the local co-operative societies. It is almost invariably the case that, where ft co-operative society has been successful, it has been managed by some person of independent means, who has undertaken the work, either voluntarily, or in return for remuneration at a more or less nominal rate. This is certainly the case with regard to Brixham, St. Ives, Fleetwood and Walton-on-the-Naze, which, between them, do more than 50 per cent, of the total business of all the societies.301. The economic position of the inshore fisherman engaged in-obtaining luxury fish, such as salmon or shellfish, is much stronger, as, unlike the inshore fisherman who catches white fish, he is not faced with competition from a highly organised industry possessed of large capital resources. None the less, this class of inshore fisherman also is faced with serious difficulties, due, in the main, to the individualism of his methods. He is just as averse as other inshore fishermen from co-operation with his fellows and is thus to the same extent at the mercy of the local fish buyers, whose prices he must accept if he is to sell his fish. Here, also, co-operation, once established, might be expected to secure a better price for the fisherman. Further, the resulting improvement in methods of marketing should make it possible to bring the fish to market more rapidly and in better condition than at present.   Co-operation should also tend to stimulate
the demand for these special classes of fish by providing fish buyers with more regular supplies than at present.802. We are much impressed with the value of the work done by the Fisheries Organisation Society and we believe that the scope of its activities could be enlarged with great advantage to the inshore fisherman working from the larger inshore fishing ports. The extension of the Society&apos;s work would, no doubt, be much easier if it were possible to increase its income, which at present amounts to about  1,200 per annum. In the existing financial conditions, we should not, however, feel justified in recommending any increase in the sum which the Society at present receives from public funds. But this does not mean that no progress is possible to-day. We believe, on the contrary, that the value of the work of the Society would be enhanced if it were brought into closer relation wdth that of the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In particular, much might be gained by associating the District Fishery Officers with the work now being done byr the Society. We recommend, therefore, that the Fisheries Department should confer with the Fisheries Organisation Society with a view to reaching agreement on a policy of closer co-operation as we suggest. In Scotland, co-operation has encountered special difficulties and only one Fishermen&apos;s Co-opera-tive Society (that at Arbroath) is in existence. The success of that Society promj^ts the hope that once the obstacles created by the intense individualism of the men have been overcome, co-operation may prove of great assistance to the inshore fishermen. We hope therefore that the Scottish Fishery Board will consider whether it would be possible to take any further steps at the present time to promote this end.(ii) The Provision of Boats and Gear.303. At various times in the past the Government has sanctioned schemes to assist fishermen to install motor power in their boats, financed by means of advances from the Development Fund. In 1912 the County Councils of Devon and Cornwall petitioned the Government to make grants for this purpose, and a committee was set up by the then President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to inquire into the applications made. As a result of their report a loan of  4,000 was made to the Cornwall County Council for the purpose of making loans to the fishermen at the ports of St. Ives, Mousehole, Newlyn, and Porth Leven, and this sum was increased in 1917 to  6,000. In the case of Devon a grant of  2,000 for experimental work was recommended, but was not accepted by the County Council. The administration of the Cornish scheme was placed in the hands of a Committee consisting of two representatives of the Cornwall County Council, two representatives of the Development Commissioners and a representative of the Fisheries Department. The loans were granted through local fishermen&apos;s societies set up in the four ports, and amounted to 92 in number of a total value of  14,829. Money received in repayment was re-lent.&apos; No loans have been granted since 1921.804. In 1917, in view of the growing shortage of food, the Government decided to offer loans to fishermen in England and Wales in order to induce them to install motor power in their boats. Advances of  50,000 in 1917, and  25,000 in 1919, were made from the Development Fund. In this case also, a certain proportion of the money repaid by the fishermen was re-lent to other applicants. The nrimber of loans was 486, amounting to  101,815. Of this sum more than  65,000 has been repaid, but nearly  36,000 has been written off as irrecoverable. There are still 9 loans outstanding for approximately  280.  No loans have been granted since 1924.305. During the period of demobilisation, the Development Commissioners, after conference with the Fisheries Departments, decided to give assistance in the replacement of boats sold or laid up during the war. In England and Wales advances amounting to  17,500 for the construction of 3 motor trawlers and 5 motor drifters were authorised from the Development Fund. In addition,  6,000 was provided from Voted Monies for the construction of an experimental
vessel equipped with improved types of gear. In Scotland between 191&apos;J and 1922 advances amounting to  48,700 were authorised from the Development Fund for the building of fishing boats and the provision of motors, including the installation of motors in existing boats. For various reasons, however, the scheme was not taken up by the fisher-men. The loans actually made amounted to only a small fraction of the amount authorised.806. We have given full consideration to the question whether further assistance on these lines is desirable. But the position has altered since the time when these measures were instituted. It is not now a question of furnishing the fisherman with the means necessary to the resumption of activity after a period of enforced idleness. The difficulties of the inshore fisheries are, as we have seen, very largely difficulties of marketing; it is &quot;the problem of finding a market where a fair price can be obtained for fish caught in small quantities and little variety. Until the difficulty of securing an adequate return for the fish the men catch has been satisfactorily dealt with, there can be little wisdom in the sinking of fresh capital in expenditure on equipment.Y__HARBOURS.(a) England and Wales.307. The concentration of the steam trawling industry at a small number of ports in England and Wales has resulted in pressure on dock and harbour accommodation. This pressure has been intensified in recent years by the building of large trawlers to fish the distant grounds and by the increase in the total landings from such grounds. In the year 1930 the four ports, Grimsby, Hull, Fleet-wood and Milford Haven, received 85 per cent, of the total quantity of white fish landed in England and Wales and 80 per cent, of the value of such fish, while the two Humber ports, Grimsby and Hull, together received as much as 69 per cent, of the quantity of white fish and 58 per cent, of the value. As the result of this concentra-tion and of the increase in the total landings, the accommodation at some of the ports has become inadequate.308. At Grimsby a new7 dock is now under construction which will provide an additional dock area of 87 acres double the existing area for fishing vessels. The work is being carried out by the Grimsby Corporation with the help of a grant from the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee. This grant, which was sanctioned in April 1929, amounts to 50 per cent, of the interest on approved expenditure on loans not exceeding  1,250,000 for a period of 15 years, or for the period of the loan, whichever is the less. The work was begun on the 5th November, 1930.809. The fish dock at Fleetwood is owned by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company who are contemplating private legislation to authorise them to construct a new dock, lock entrance and jetty7. These improvements aim at providing accom-modation at Fleetwood for the largest type of trawlers. The estimated cost of the work is about  700,000.310. The docks at Milford Haven are owned by a Dock Company. Works designed for the relief of congestion have recently been carried out with the aid of financial assistance from the Development Public Utility7 Advisory Committee under Part I of the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929. This assistance took the form of a grant of 5 per cent, for six years on capital expenditure up to a maximum of  14,762. The improvements consisted of an extension of coal storage sidings, the provision of an additional coal conveyer to facilitate the coaling of trawlers and an extension of the trawl market.811. At Hull there has been a remarkable development of the fishing industry since the War. The landings of fish have risen from about 1,600,000 cwts. in 1918 to 4,200,000 cwts. in 1930; an increase of over 160 per cent. During the period of seven years up to the end of 1929, 111 new trawlers were built at a cost of about  1,850,000.   During the same period over  400,000 was expended
on the extension of ice factories, fishmeal factories, curing houses and stores. There has also been a large increase in the number of fish merchants in consequence of this increase in the fish traffic. The accommodation in the Hull docks has for some time been in-adequate. Some steps have been taken to relieve the congestion on the dock side by the London and North Eastern Eailway Company, the owners of the docks, who, in 1929, completed the widening of the Iceland market by about 30 ft. for its whole length of 1,400 ft. The improvement included a large wooden structure containing office accommodation for the fish merchants. Within a week of its com-pletion, however, this structure was completely destroyed by fire. This market is now being reconstructed. When completed the new market will afford some relief to the congestion on the dock side, but there will still be need for additional berthing accommodation for the trawlers.312. There is congestion also at Yarmouth and Lowestoft during the herring season. This is not, however, due to any tendency towards increased concentration. It is purely seasonal and occurs for only about two months in each year. With a view to relieving the congestion at Yarmouth, the Yarmouth Port and Haven Com-missioners applied in March 1930, for a grant from the Development Fund to cover the whole of the cost of constructing a new tidal basin estimated at  192,000. The Harbour Commissioners stated that they were unable to make any contribution themselves towards the cost of the work, as it was not anticipated that it would result in any appreciable increase in revenue. In the circumstances, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries did not feel justified in recom-mending a 100 per cent, grant from the Development Fund. The Harbour Commissioners have recently allotted an extra 300 feet of quay space for the export trade in fresh herrings known as the &quot; Klondyking &quot; trade. At Lowestoft, the London and North Eastern Eailway Company are also providing additional accommodation for &quot; Klondyking &quot; steamers.313. Many small fishery harbours have received assistance from the Development Fund. This Fund was established under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, which authorises the Treasury to make advances from the fund in aid of the construction and improvement of harbours generally; but the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, restricted this authorisation to advances for the &quot;construction, improvement and maintenance of harbours in connection with the improvement and development of fisheries.314. From 1919 up to December, 1931, applications for assistance were received from 36 harbours in England and Wales. Assistance has been given in 16 eases and refused in 17, while the remaining 3 applications have lapsed. The total cost of the works aided from the Development Fund during the period mentioned will, when the works are completed, amount to  186,000. In aid of these works Development Fund grants amounting to nearly  97,000 and Develop-ment Fund loans amounting to nearly  20,000 have been sanctioned, while the local contributions amount to about  26,800 by way of grants, and  43,500 by way of loans. The total annual value of fish landed at these harbours to which assistance has been sanctioned amounts to about  335,000; the number of whole-time fishermen working from the harbours is about 1,100.315. The works covered by the foregoing grants consist of the construction and repair of breakwaters, the improvement of landing facilities, and the provision of motor winches to facilitate the beaching of boats. The harbours which have received assistance are in the north-east of England and in Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall.316. The Development Commissioners have no power to make advances to harbours which are privately owned, or which are con-ducted for profit by a Company. In cases, however, where the Com-missioners have considered that advances to such harbours were in the public interest, this technical difficulty has been surmounted by arranging for the transfer of the harbour in question to an association of persons not trading for profit that was willing to maintain the
harbour as a public concern. Under the Fishery Harbours Act, 1915, the Board (now Ministry) of Agriculture and Fisheries was empowered to make Orders setting up harbour authorities for small harbours principally used by the fishing industry. The Act also empowers local authorities to contribute to the expenses of a harbour authority consti-tuted under the Act. The procedure under this Act avoids the cost and delay involved in obtaining a Provisional Order.817. Our general conclusion on this part of our inquiry is that wherever harbour authorities have sufficient funds at their disposal, the facilities provided are adequate to meet the needs of the fishing popula-tion. This, however, is not the case with the inshore fishing ports. The harbour authorities of the latter are largely composed of local fishermen and often lack the financial resources and the administrative and financial experience that are necessary for the proper management of the harbours. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of them are much in arrear with the repayment of the loans which they have received from the Development Commissioners for the improvement of their harbour works. The weakness of harbour authorities of this type was well shown in 1929, when the Development Commissioners found it necessary, in the case of five such authorities in England and Wales, to remit debts amounting to over i&apos;15,000 which were clearly irrecoverable.318. We have considered whether to meet this difficulty it would be possible to transfer responsibility for these harbours to some larger body possessed of more adequate resources, such as the County- Councils or the Sea Fisheries Committees (see paragraph 245). On examina-tion, however, neither of these authorities appear to be suitable. County Councils are already faced with many urgent problems of local government and it is unlikely that they would consent to undertake this responsibility unless they were indemnified from public funds for the additional expenditure involved. Apart, however, from this difficulty, County Councils would not be very well fitted to discharge this task, as few of their members would be likely to have any special knowledge of, or interest in, fishery problems. From this point of view, the Sea Fisheries Committees are to be preferred. The main function, how-ever, of these Committees is to regulate the local fisheries by the issue of by-laws, and unless they were thoroughly reorganised it is doubtful whether they would be able to cany out the financial and administra-tive duties which would be involved by a transfer to them of responsibility for the local fishery harbours. Moreover, the only funds at the disposal of these Committees are drawn from the County rates, and the County Councils would, no doubt, strongly resist any proposal which had the effect of imposing on them financial responsibility for these harbours, while withholding from them administrative control.319. Another suggestion that was put to us was that there should be constituted a central authority to which should be transferred responsibility for the management and upkeep of the fishery harbours along the coasts of England and Wales. There are, however, in our view, sound reasons against the creation of such a body. Both the outlook of the local fisheries and the needs of the harbours differ widely7 on different parts of the coast, and it would, we believe, be very difficult to create a central body that would command the confidence of the various fishing communities. Further, the transfer of responsibility for these harbours from the local authorities to a central body would still further weaken the sense of responsibility of the local fishery communities for the upkeep of their harbours. Indeed, it is from this standpoint that the scheme for a central authority is open to the most serious objection. It would, we believe, be impossible to provide such a body with an adequate income drawn from local sources. If it were constituted, its income could, therefore, only be derived from public funds and there would, in our view, be no justification for the transfer to the taxpayer of financial responsibility for such an essentially local service as the upkeep of these small fishery harbours.820. For the reasons given above, we do not recommend the transfer of responsibility for fishery harbours from the existing harbour authorities either to some financially stronger local body or to a central body specially created for this purpose.   We are impressed, however,
with the need for greater eo-ordination of Government policy hi relation to fisheries harbours, and this could, in our view, be secured by a slight extension of the existing functions of the Development Commission. Already, we are informed, it is the policy of the Commissioners in dealing with applications for harbour improvement to pay regard to national, as well as to purely local, considerations. It is with this aim in view that on different occasions they have prepared surveys of harbours over considerable stretches of coast, e.g., Devon and Cornwall, and the North-East coast of England. In this way, they have been able to assess the importance of fishing ports in relation to one another along particular parts of the coast, and have thus been able to regulate the degree of assistance to be given to them from public funds. The weakness, however, of this method of approach to the problem lies in the fact that the initiative rests not with the Development Commission, but with the local harbour authorities. For, at present, it is only when an application is received for assistance from a particular harbour that the attention of the Commission is directed to the fisheries problem of that part of the coast. Further, it is, we think, essential that in the consideration of these harbour applications at least as much attention should be given to such problems as the facilities at the disposal of the fishermen for the marketing of their fish as to the question whether, from engineering and other technical standpoints, such assistance would be justified. We have already seen (see paragraphs 295-297) how great are the difficulties with which the inshore fishermen are confronted in the disposal of their fish. These difficulties owe their origin in substantial part to the smallness of the communities in which the fishing population live and the inadequacy of the harbours from which they work. To some extent, therefore, the grant of assistance, however much it may be justified on (say) engineering grounds, to small fishing ports, may actually serve only to increase the fishermen&apos;s difficulties by tempting them to renew the struggle in existing conditions and with obsolete methods. On the other hand, greater co-ordination of policy tending in any given district to concentrate the grant of Government assistance at a small number of ports or even at a single port, might well provide just the stimulus necessary to persuade the inshore fishermen to adopt new methods of marketing or even to move to the larger and better-equipped fishing ports along the coast.321. The first essential is that the Development Commission should have at their disposal an up-to-date survey of the fishing ports and of the problems of the fishermen by whom they are used. Such a survey should embrace a consideration not only of the technical problems on which the Development Commission have hitherto in the main concentrated their attention, but also of those wider questions relating to the economic position of the fishermen to which we have already referred. We are encouraged to recommend that such a survey should be undertaken by the Commission, by the evidence we have received regarding the valuable results which they secured when they adopted a similar policy in dealing with fisheries research (see paragraph 338). Prior to the war, there w7as no adequate co-ordination of research in this field, and the position was naturally further aggravated by the difficulties of the war-period. After the war, the Commission appointed a Committee to review the whole subject of the grant of public funds for the furtherance of fisheries research. This survey proved of great value, by providing the Commission with a general appreciation of the whole subject in the light of which they were in a much better position to judge the merits of particular schemes subsequently submitted to them. In the consideration of such schemes, they continued to receive advice from this Committee, which, on the completion of the survey, was constituted as a standing Advisory Committee on Fishery Research.322. We accordingly recommend that the Development Commission should carry through as speedily as possible, in consulta-tion with the English and Scottish Fisheries Departments, a general survey of the problems of the inshore fishing ports on the lines indicated in the preceding paragraphs. On its completion, the Commission would, we believe, be in a position to frame, a comprehensive policy for the development of the inshore fisheries.
(b) Scotland.323. The Scottish trawling fleets are based on commercial ports such as Aberdeen, Leith (including Newhaven), Granton and Dundee. The main centre is Aberdeen where substantial improve-ments are at present in progress. The Dundee fleet is small, and the facilities at that port seem adequate. The conditions in the Leith district are not ideal, but the harbour authorities concerned have not formulated any definite improvement scheme.324. The herring and inshore fishing communities are of small size, ranging from hamlets to towns not exceeding 12,000 inhabitants, and the majority of the harbours were originally constructed for the small boats employed at the fishing up to about 50 years ago. Since then the fishing fleet has been revolutionised. Larger boats and vessels ranging up to the steam drifter of 90 feet in length and 11 feet draught are now in use, but improvements of the harbours have not hitherto kept pace with the improvements of the vessels, and in few cases can it be said that the movements of fishing vessels are not hampered by lack of suitable accommodation or lack of depth.325. After the establishment of the Development Fund in 1909 many improvement schemes were commenced, both at the herring landing ports and at the home ports of the drifters. Since April 1922 grants amounting to  215,100 and loans amounting to . 92,850 have been sanctioned for the assistance of Scottish harbours from this Fund and, in addition, similar assistance has been given to these harbours by the Public Works Loan Board. The grants and loans from the Development Fund to harbours in England and Wales amounted to  73,031 and  21,794 respectively. It will be seen, therefore, that assistance from public funds has been given to Scottish harbours on a much larger scale than to those in England and Wales. This is due mainly to the fact that the harbours of the East coast of Scotland, where the bulk of the herring catch is landed, are more exposed than those on the East coast of England, and can only be maintained against the storms in those waters at a cost which is beyond the means of the small local communities and the fishing fleet using the harbours.326. The war and the depression in the herring industry which followed it not only prevented the completion of the schemes which had been planned and the execution of other necessary improvements, but involved many of the harbours in a load of debt beyond their power to bear. Measures have, however, been taken or instituted within the last two years by His Majesty &quot;a Government which will materially relieve the debt situation and will lead to substantial improvements of the conditions of the harbours.327. Debts amounting in all to  240,000, due either to the Development Fund or the Public Works Loan Board, have been remitted, advances amounting to  225,000 have been sanctioned for improvements, and special arrangements have been made for the dredging of fishery harbours. In addition, other schemes for improve-ment are, we understand, under consideration by the Departments concerned. In the light of the evidence that we have received we are satisfied that a continuance of the present policy for a period will place the Scottish harbour situation in a satisfactory position.328. The small piers and harbours required for transport and fishery purposes in the &apos;&apos; congested districts &apos;&apos; on the north and west coasts and the islands of Scotland form a separate problem, in which the fishing interest is not as a rule predominant. It has been receiving the consideration of an inter-Departmental Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and we do not therefore comment upon it further.329. In view of the large amount of public money expended on Scottish fishery harbours, we regard it as essential that steps should be taken to guard against any failure on the part of the local authorities to keep the harbours in a proper state of repair, and we think that an early opportunity should bo taken to obtain from Parliament such statutory powers as may be necessary and practicable to enable the Scottish Fishery Board to ensure this.
380. We are informed that difficulty has frequently been experienced in constituting authorities for small harbours in Scotland owing to the cost of the statutory procedure involved. We understand that the Scottish authorities have had under consideration the pro-motion of legislation to facilitate the acquisition of small fishery harbours by local authorities. We recommend that an early opportunity should be taken of asking Parliament to pass legislation to this end. We are, further, of opinion that the proposed legislation should make provision for some simple method by which harbour authorities may obtain powers to undertake works, and by which existing harbour provisional orders may be amended on such matters as the alteration of schedules of dues.YI.-RESEARCH.331. The main divisions of research in relation to the problems of the fishing industry are. (a) marine research dealing with living fish and their environment, and (b) research into methods of preserving fish from the time of capture to the time when it reaches the consumer, and (c) research into the design and equipment of fishing vessels.(a) Marine Research.(i) Deep Sea Investigations.332. Deep sea research is conducted on an international basis through the Permanent International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, a scientific organisation founded in 1902 upon which most of the fishing nations of Europe are represented. The Council studies the main kinds of fish of commercial importance. Area Committees allot to the different nations their particular share in the programme. Great Britain&apos;s share comprises haddock, herring, plaice, cod, and a certain amount of work on the hake and sprat. The Fishery Board for Scotland concentrates its attention upon haddock and herring, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries upon herring, plaice, cod and hake.333. It will be seen from Appendix II, Note 9, that the total expenditure in 1930 from public funds on fishery research amounted in England and Wales to  103,324 and in Scotland to  20,174. The Development Commissioners co-ordinate the work in England and Scotland, acting on the advice of their Advisory Committee on Fishery Research, which includes leading representatives of the basic sciences upon which-fishery research depends, together with practical fishery experts. Remarkable progress has been made by the two Fisheries Departments since work was resumed in this country after the break caused by the War. They have been greatly assisted by the advice given by the Advisory Committee.334. The English and Scottish Fishery Departments each possess a scientific staff, well-equipped laboratories, a research vessel of the large steam trawler type, and a smaller motor vessel for inshore work. Moreover, in furtherance of the policy of linking up the activities of marine research workers in Great Britain, the main Marine Biological Stations in the country, particularly that at Plymouth, have been placed on a satisfactory financial footing by means of grants from the Development Fund, so that they may continue to carry out that general work on marine biology and hydrography which is required to supplement the more specialised work of the Departments. The staff of the Marine Institutions and of the Departments work in close touch with one another. There is no hard and fast line of demarcation, but, broadly speaking, researches deliberately planned to find a solution of problems affecting the commercial fisheries (&quot;directed researches&quot;) are entrusted to the Departments, and researches, the object of which is the general advancement of the knowledge of marine life in relation to its environment (&apos;&apos; free researches &quot;), are allotted to the independent Institutions.
335. The International Council co-ordinates . the work of the fifteen countries represented on it, and its publications keep fishery research workers informed of the progress made in the different branches of the subject in all the participating countries. Its annual Meetings, at which programmes of work are framed and adopted, furnish also an opportunity for exchange of ideas between marine workers from almost the whole of Europe. Furthermore, at meetings of the Challenger Society, which are held three times a year, British scientific workers engaged in marine research have an opportunity of meeting together and discussing matters of common interest.336. Other Government Departments which co-operate in the work of marine research are the Admiralty (Hydrographic Depart-ment and Fisheries and Minesweeping Service); the Air Ministry (Meteorological Office), and the Government Chemist. Some work in this field is also done by Trinity House, while the fishing industry and various steamship companies render assistance from time to time.337. The main objects to which deep sea research is directed are (a) the problem of over-fishing, and (b) the prediction of good or bad fishing seasons.338. It is only in comparatively recent years that the danger of over-fishing has arisen. Before the introduction and spread of steam trawling, the resources of the sea could safely be regarded as inexhaustible by the methods of fishing lining and trawling by sailing boats then in use. The development of steam trawling, however, has so greatly increased the intensity of fishing as to raise doubts whether a greater weight of fish is not being taken from the sea annually than can be replaced by the natural processes of repro-duction and growth. Although the extermination of a particular fish population still seems out of the question, there is no doubt that the balance of fish life is being changed by intensive fishing operations. For instance, according to figures of landings at Aberdeen supplied by the Fishery Board for Scotland, the proportion of &quot; extra large&quot; and &apos;&apos; large &apos;&apos; haddocks these being the most profitable classes has fallen from 40 per cent, in 1913 to 16 per cent, in 1928, that of &quot; mediums &quot; from 18 per cent, to 12 per cent., hut that of &quot; smalls &quot; has risen from 42 per cent, to 72 per cent. Figures furnished to us; by the English Department relating to landings at all ports in England and Wales, reveal a similar tendency- with regard to the plaice fishing, viz., the proportion of &quot; large &quot; has fallen from 24 per cent, in 1913 to 7 per cent, in 1928, that of &quot;mediums&quot; from 41 per cent, to 27 per cent., but that of &quot;smalls&quot; has risen from 35 per cent, to 66 per cent.389. The extension of trawling to distant grounds relieved the pressure for a time and the war gave the grounds some rest, and permitted a certain accumulation of stock. This temporary surplus, however, soon disappeared when fishing operations were resumed. It is, in our opinion, essential that unremitting attention should be given to marine research, with the object of ensuring that the maximum annual yield of fish is taken at the least possible cost and without prejudicing future supplies.340. Considerable progress has been made in connection with the second main object of deep sea research, viz., the prediction of good and bad seasons, and it is now possible to forecast the prospects of certain important fisheries with reasonable accuracy, particularly the haddock fishery and the East Anglian herring fishery. Experi-ments are also being carried out with different kinds of fishing gear with the object of avoiding the capture of undersized and com-mercially valueless fish.341. As regards personnel engaged in fishery research, the English Department is adequately staffed for the work allotted to it; but we understand that the Fishery Board for Scotland are handi-capped in their research work by the small size of their scientific and technical staff.342. We understand that the recent undertaking by the Govern-ment to ask Parliament to vote a special sum of  500,000 into the
Development Fund for capital expenditure for the benefit, among other subjects, of fishery research, will enable the Development Commissioners to make good any deficiencies as regards equipment which may still exist.(ii) Inshore Research.848. Work on shellfish is carried out at the Ministry of Agricul-tufe and Fisheries&apos; Shellfish Research Station at Conway, where a system of cleansing polluted mussels has been devised and is avail-able for extension to the areas where important mussel beds are closed on account of contamination. We have already discussed this matter in the section dealing with the inshore fisheries (paragraphs 278 to 281).344. A process for cleansing oysters analogous to the mussel cleansing process has been worked out on a commercial scale, and now only awaits application by planters.345. Investigations into the crab and lobster fisheries are being conducted by both Departments.- 346. Research on oyster breeding is also carried on at Conway, with the object of discovering those factors which, in combination, result in a successful settlement on tiles and other collectors of the young oysters (spat) at the end of their free-swimming stage of life, and their subsequent survival and growth. It is hoped that from oysters bred in tanks plnnters may obtain a more regular supply of young stock than is available on the natural beds, where spatting is uncertain and precarious.347. Investigations into problems connected with salmon and 6ea trout, which are largely fished in tidal waters, and are, therefore, of importance to inshore fishermen, are mainly carried on by the Fishery Board for Scotland, who, working in conjunction with the Ministry, are also undertaking research into the disease of salmon known as Furunculosis, which is causing serious damage to the salmon fisheries of England and Scotland.348. The evidence submitted to us with regard to marine research has been more in the nature of a general outline than a detailed account of the particular researches which are being carried on by members of the scientific staffs of the Departments and the independent Marine Institutions. The impression we have formed is that fishery research in England and Scotland is being effectively carried on in accordance with a well-thought out plan, designed to ensure the maximum of co-operation between research workers in Great Britain and in foreign countries. We have no specific recommendations to make as regards this part of our subject, and can only express the hope that in spite of the financial difficulties of the present time funds will continue to be provided on an adequate scale in order that the important work of fishery research may not be hampered.(b) Preservation Research.349. The Fisheries Departments are thus concerned with the technique of fishing and the life histories of fish used for human food. The transport, storage and treatment of fish subsequent to its catching is the province of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Subject to general control by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Department&apos;!) investigations in these fields are carried out on the advice and undei the general supervision of the Food Investigation Board. Their expenditure on this service in 1930/31 amounted to  11,400.350. The Departments research on fish has fallen into two phases. The first of these began when the Food Investigation Board, established in 1917, surveyed certain aspects of the general problem, such as the freezing of fish, the canning of fish, the handling and transport of fish, the bacteriology of fish, and the discoloration on dry salted fish.   It soon became evident, however, that satisfactory
work depended on an adequate supply of fish fresher than it was possible to obtain, even when special transport was arranged, at an inland research station, and research was practically suspended until arrangements could be made for the provision of a station at a fishing port with facilities for doing work afloat.351. In 1927 the Imperial Economic Committee (Fifth Report  Fish-Cmd. 2934, paras. 77 to 98 and 162 (XV to XXIX)) emphasised the importance of this kind of research and made a number of recommendations including the following: &quot; We believe that the first essential, the sine qua now, for all improvement of organisation lies in the study and application of better methods of preserving fish at an economic cost.&quot; So we reach our principal recommendation, which is, that research should be instituted with a view to improving the methods of preserving fish from the moment when it has been caught to the moment when it reaches the consumer.&apos;&apos; We think that this Research should be based on (a) a Central Station at a Fishing Port in Great Britain; (b) a specially constructed vessel . . . .&quot;352. As a result of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, increased funds were made available by means of grants from the Empire Marketing Board, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research established a research station at Torry on Aberdeen harbour. This station consists of two buildings, formerly part of a shipbuilding yard. One has been converted into biochemical and bacteriological laboratories, and the other has been equipped for various experiments in connection with cold-storage, smoke-curing, oil-extraction. &amp;c. This equipment is in part experimental, and is suitable only for dealing with small quantities of fish. It is antici-pated that, as experience is gained, it will be possible to determine the type of permanent building and equipment required for work on a larger scale.358. Similarly, the lack of experience prompted caution with regard to the research vessel. It was thought wiser not to proceed with the building of a research vessel until it was known to what extent it was feasible to carry out this particular sort of biological work at sea. A second-hand steam drifter was therefore bought and adapted for this work. This vessel is at present used to maintain supplies of fish of known history for experimental purposes, and for such investigations as it is desirable and possible to carry out at sea..354. The research at Torry lies in two broad fields, namely, work on the preservation of fish for consumption and work on such processes as salting, smoking, the extraction of fish oils, &amp;c.855. The micro-organisms which are largely responsible for the rapid deterioration of fish are being studied at Torry in co-operation with the Bacteriological Department of Aberdeen University. A preliminary investigation made at sea in the summer in 1927 showed that the rapid deterioration of fish caught and handled commercially is due, not to intrinsic changes for the flesh of fish has a slow intrinsic rate of deterioration- but to the post-mortem invasion of bacteria, some present when the fish is caught, others acquired during the process of gutting, handling and stowing. This observation immediately opened up a line of practicable experiment. Two steam trawlers were chartered during the summer and autumn of 1928, and were fitted with various devices designed to ensure more cleanly handling and more effective stowage in ice than obtains in ordinary commercial practice. The work is fully described in a Report entitled &quot; The Handling and Stowage of White Fish at Sea &quot; (Stationery Office Publication, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Food Investigation Special. Report No. 37). It was found that by using the methods of handling and stowing described in detail in the Report, the maintenance of white fish, e.g., cod, haddock, hake, in a fresh state in crushed ice the ordinary commercial medium employed was increased from 6-7 days to 10-12 days. The fish was consistently fresher age for age, and a larger proportion of the total catch was landed fresh.   Tests showed that while ice at its melting point retards the
activity-of bacteria, it does not arrest their growth, and after a certain period ceases to be an effective preservative. This period would, for practical purposes, limit the round trip of a vessel to fourteen days. The installation necessary to enable these new methods to be adopted on one of the smaller short-distance trawlers, consists of improve-ments of the water, fish cleaning, and fish stowage systems, and is estimated to cost 42500. An addition of  400 a year to the running costs would also be involved.356. So far as concerns the problem of short-distance voyages which account for about 80 per cent, of the total annual landings of white fish by British fishing vessels, it may be said that research has shown that the use of certain methods would enable the whole of the catch to be landed in a satisfactory condition of freshness. Full particulars of such methods with detailed specifications of the installations required, and estimates of cost have been available to the industry since October 1929. The problem has accordingly become one of economic experiment and the organisation of com-mercial practice, which are matters for the persons engaged in the industry who stand to reap the benefit presumably a considerable one which would accrue from a substantial increase in the percentage of fish landed in first-class condition from short-distance voyages.357. We understand that some of the devices and appliances recommended in the Report, e.g., metal-fitted fish rooms and deck appliances for washing fish have been installed in some of the new trawlers, and that the improved methods are being tested out in part by certain owners at trawling ports. It is possible that some of those methods may not be practicable when the weather is rough and when catches are exceptionally large. The publication of the Report has undoubtedly stimulated owners to make the best use of existing accommodation and to improve conditions as much as possible. The translation of the results of research into commercial practice is always slow, but in view of the importance of the matter we hope that the trawling industry as a whole will lose no time in testing these recommendations in order that if they prove practicable they may be generally adopted.358. Long-distance voyages, unfortunately, present greater difficulties. The introduction on long-distance trawlers of the cleanlier methods of handling and stowage referred to above with any necessary modifications required to adapt them to larger vessels  should enable more fish to be brought back fresh from distant grounds, but, however carefully the fish is handled and stowed on board the trawler, the time limit to the efficiency of ice as a preservation-tive will have passed in the case of substantial part of the catch brought from those grounds. For the moment this limitation mainly concerns England, as 18 per cent, of the landings of white fish at English ports in 1929 came from voyages of fourteen days and over, whereas only a very small proportion about 1 per cent, in 1929 of the white fish landed from Scottish vessels came from distant grounds.359. The development of the Bear Island fishery and the opening up of new fishing grounds in that region make the problem of &quot;long-distance&quot; preservation increasingly important. No commercially practicable means of preserving fish on board long-distance trawlers, so that the fish, on landing, will be as fresh as when caught, has yet been devised, but the trend of the work at thy Torry Research Station points towards the freezing of fish in brine and its storage at a temperature lower than that usually adopted hitherto on British vessels.360. When fish is frozen and kept in cold storage, the changes which occur in its tissues depend upon the rate of the original freezing and the temperature of the subsequent storage. The ill -effects of these changes upon the texture, flavour and appearance of the fish, when it is ultimately thawed out, can be reduced by a combination of quick freezing and storage at low temperature. The most suitable rate of freezing and temperature of storage in coinbina-tion for six weeks of refrigeration (this being taken as covering the
maximum period of a trawler&apos;s voyage) has been ascertained by experiments conducted at Torry. Thus haddock, fresh from the sea, &apos; quickly frozen in common salt brine at a temperature of -5&quot; F., and subsequently stored at the same temperature or lower, at the end oi six weeks, lost nothing in appearance or palatability, and, further-more, proved highly suitable for smoke-curing. Fish thus treated may be expected to be almost as readily saleable as fresh fish. It should certainly have a value considerably higher than fish which has been stowed in ice alone for much shorter periods of time.361. The temperatures shown above are unusually low for refrigeration practice in Great Britain, and the experimental results were obtained by using refrigerating plant which would be too expensive to instal and operate on board a trawler. However, refrigerating engineers are already considering the practical commercial questions which now arise, with a view to designing suitable machinery, economical both as to capital outlay and running costs. The solution, therefore, of the problem of freezing fish in long-distance trawlers, appears to turn upon the question of designing an economically practical refrigerating plant.362. Already brine-frozen halibut caught off Greenland is stored at low temperatures of this order on board large parent ships. Such halibut has been marketed in a satisfactory condition and sold at prices which, it is true, are less than those obtained for fresh halibut, but which, nevertheless, show the existence in this country of a demand for one kind of white fish which has been preserved by brine-freezing and cold-storage.363. The introduction of large factory ships may lead to important developments. The technical experience already gained from these Greenland expeditions for halibut, coupled with the results of the work-on fish freezing at Torry, may lead to a complete change in the methods employed for fishing on the more distant grounds. It may be that trawling will develop on one or other of the following lines : Long-distance fishing may be carried out by factory ships with ancillary smaller vessels capable of remaining at sea for (say) six months, or by trawlers that both catch and store the fish but which are limited to a voyage of two months without refuelling. Trawlers of the latter type would require to be larger than the largest British trawlers now built, probably about two hundred &quot;feet in length.364. The work discussed above covers only a part of the Imperial Economic Committee&apos;s recommendation as to preservation inasmuch as it stops at the stage when the fish is landed at the fishing port. Further investigations will be directed to the improvement of the methods of preserving fish while it is at the ports, such as handling on the fish markets and packing for transport. Some preliminary published observations* disclosed a primd facie case for reform in the direction of cleanlier conditions, more careful handling and other measures designed to preserve the quality of fish. The port markets, as the first link in the chain to the consumer after the fish has been landed, should clearly be the first to be investigated when circumstances-stances permit.365. The second broad class of research conducted at Tony embraces work on such processes as the smoke-curing of fish, which should prove of considerable value to the industry. There is an important connection between the demand for smoked fish and the value of some of the main sorts of fish landed at British ports. British smoked products, such as finnon haddocks and kippered herrings, are consumed in considerable quantities both at home and abroad. Wood smoke gives a rich appearance and an attractive flavour besides acting as a preservative. Smoke-curing has been practised for many centuries, but it has hitherto received but scant scientific attention. The process, which consists of hanging fish in a kiln for a time over the smoke of smouldering sawdust or chips-sometimes peat is used is simple, but its effect on the fish is varied and uncertain. Apart from the nature of the wood used, the good flavour and texture of the cured fish depends on the temperature* See Roport of Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on tha Handling and Trunsport of Fish, 1925.
and humidity of the smoke, both of which are greatly influenced, by atmospheric conditions. In the experimental smoking kiln which has been erected at Torry research is being directed towards finding the best temperatures and humidities for curing the usual kinds of fish. This is with a view to devising some effective and inexpensive plant for controlling these factors during smoking operations.366. Another field of research for which laboratory accommoda-tion and equipment has been provided at Torry consists of investi-gations into the nature and functions of the oils and fats of different fish. Souring of the body oils, for example, appears to play an important part in the rapid deterioration of the herring. This work also aims at providing means for the better utilisation of liver oils. The medicinal value of cod liver oil is already well known, but the usefulness of the liver oils of other fish is a subject which hitherto has not been much explored.(c) Research into the Design and Equipment of Fishing Vessels.867. At our suggestion, the attention of the appropriate Associations which exist to forward the interests of owners of fishing vessels has been directed to yet another type of research which offers possibilities of helpfulness, viz., research into the design of hulls and -screw propellers of small steam vessels, with the object of securing more economic fuel consumption, greater speed, efficiency and sea-worthiness. Facilities for carrying out investigations of this nature exist in the Fronde Tank at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, and judging from the improvements in design which have resulted from other investigations in that tank on small steam vessels, notably whalers, there is every prospect of good results being obtained by investigation concerning trawlers and drifters.368. The equipment of fishing vessels has been the subject of inquiries on the part of the fishery departments of England and Scotland for a number of years. In both cases such investigations have been chiefly concerned with tests of the catching and releasing power of various nets, the object in view being to determine the size and type of mesh which best combines efficient capture with the sparing of undersized fish. Progress is necessarily gradual in inquiries of this kind, but a considerable quantity of data has been collected as to the sizes of fish of various kinds taken and released by meshes of various sizes and modified trawls of various types.369. In the investigations of the Scottish Fishery Board special attention has been given to the capture in excessive numbers of haddock and plaice of less than marketable ,size, which occurs under modern fishing conditions. The effects of the commercial trawl and its modern improvements have been considered and reports on the result of slight increases in the sizes of the meshes used especially in the cod-ends as regards the capture of under-sized fish, have been submitted to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. The histories of successive annual haddock broods in post-war years have been determined by means of continuous and intensive investigations, the results of which have been communicated in a series of publications issued by the Board and by the International Council. A continuous survey has also been made of the populations of small plaice which are found almost exclusively within territorial limits in Scottish waters. In addition to direct experiments as to the action of fishing gear the effect of different methods of fishing has been investigated chiefly by means of an extensive series of marking experiments in selected areas. As a result of these experi-nients the by-laws relating to the coastal white seine net fishing have been amended the size of.the meshes in the wings of the net has been increased and the minimum size of flatfish which may be landed has been raised from 8 to 10 inches.
YII. MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS.(a) The Moray Firth.370. In the course of our inquiry, our attention has been drawn to the difficult situation which has been created by the partial closing to trawling of the Moray Firth. This question has been the subject of controversy ever 3ince the enactment in 1889 of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act. That Act prohibited trawling within three miles of low-water mark off any part of the coast of Scotland, and within certain bays specified in a schedule. Under Section 7, power was also given to the Fishery- Board for Scotland to make by-laws, subject to confirmation by the Secretary for Scotland, prohibiting trawling within the Moray Firth, that is to say, within an area, the seaward limit of which is defined by a line drawn from Duncarisby Head in Caithness to Battray Point in Aberdeenshire. The distance between these two points is 75 miles and the area of the Firth thus defined is 1,500 square miles. The main object of the Act in seeking to close the Moray Firth appears to have been to give protection to fishermen engaged in inshore fishing in the Firth in the intervals of the herring fishing. No doubt it was hoped by this means also to prevent the depletion of the fisheries by protecting the spawning grounds in the Firth and also to provide a nursery for immature fish there.371. Acting on the powers conferred upon them by this Act, the Scottish Fishery- Board proceeded to make two by-laws closing at first a part, and afterwards the whole, of the Firth to trawling. It appears&apos; that at the time when this Act was passed, few, if any. foreign trawlers fished in the Firth, but after the issue of these by-laws, foreign trawlers made their appearance, at the instigation, so it was thought in some quarters, of British trawling interests which were anxious to test the validity of the Scottish Fishery Board&apos;s position. However this may be, it was not long before considerable difficulties were experienced in the application of the by-law to foreign trawlers. In 1906, this question was considered by the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland on an appeal brought by a skipper of a Norwegian vessel, named Mortensen, against a conviction for an offence under the by-law. The Court had not, on that occasion, to express an opinion on the question whether or not the Act was in conformity with the usually accepted principles of international law: but two of the judges dealt with the wider aspects of the question. One of them (Lord Dunedin) expressed the view that there were several grounds for thinking that the locus of Mortensen&apos;s offence* was intra fauces terrae, i.e., within the jaws of the land. The other judge (Lord Kyllachy) went further and repudiated the view that in international law any part of the Moray Firth could be regarded as part of the open sea. The Court decided that the by-law under the Act of 1889 was valid and could be enforced against all persons of whatever nationality. The situation was transformed by the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1907, on representations received from the Norwegian Government, to release the foreign skippers then in.prison in this country and to discontinue the prosecution of foreigners for offences under the Act. In the twenty-four years that have elapsed since this decision was taken in 1907, no change has taken place in the legal position apart from the passing of the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Act, 1909, which is mentioned below (paragraph 374). The Act of 1889 and the by-laws issued under it are unrepealed. They are strictly enforced against British trawlers, but no prosecutions are taken against foreign trawlers that operate in the Firth in contravention of their provisions. The situation thus created is illogical in the extreme and if the question was not complicated by other considera-tions we should nave no hesitation in recommending that the by-law should either be enforced in its entirety or be repealed.872. The objections to repeal are weighty. We find that the Scottish fishermen are as hostile as ever to the presence of trawlers* This was approximately five miles off Lossiemouth.
in the Firth. The total number of fishermen affected is about 8,000 (or one-third of the total fishing population in Scotland). Their catch of White fish averages  220,000 per annum in value, or, if herrings which they take round the coast of Britain are included, it amounts to 160,000 tons valued at about  1,600,000. Of these fishermen, about 6,000 are engaged in fishing for white fish, only in the intervals of the herring season. Part of the fishing is conducted by means of anchored cod-nets, a form of fishing which has largely-grown up since 1906. This is the cause of added difficulty in the regulation of the Moray Firth fishing, as foreign trawlers operate on the same grounds and cause serious damage to the cod-nets. The damage on this account was particularly severe in 1981 when the fishermen&apos;s losses were estimated at  800. It is suggested that to some extent the fishermen contribute to these losses by omitting to take the adequate precautions of marking, lighting, and watching their nets. This omission is said to be due to the conviction in their minds that such measures serve not to warn the foreign vessels from such fishing grounds, but actually to attract them there by indicating where the cod are to be found. In these circumstances, it is only natural that the cod-net fishermen as well as the line fishermen should press for the exclusion of foreign trawlers from the Firth and that they would strongly resist any proposal that the numbers of trawlers should be increased by the opening of the Firth to British trawlers.873. On the other side, the British trawlers have a legitimate grievance in being excluded from fishing in the Firth, so long as their foreign rivals are free to do so. This grievance is, however, perhaps less serious than it appears at first sight. We have explained elsewhere (paragraph 143) how with the increase in the size of trawlers and with improved methods of storing fish on board ship the trawling industry has in recent times tended to go further and further afield for its fishing. The larger quantities of fish to be obtained on the more distant grounds have more than compensated for the additional expenditure involved in the longer voyages of the trawlers. As a result, the older fishing grounds in the waters nearer home have assumed a position of much less importance than formerly. This is particularly true so far as the English trawling companies are concerned. It is probable indeed that if the Firth were opened to British trawlers, fewr would take advantage of this permission apart from the trawlers, mostly of smaller size, which operate from Scottish ports, e.g., Aberdeen.374. Further, the injustice which the present position imposes on the British trawling industry has been mitigated to some extent by the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Act, 1909. That measure prohibits the landing or sale of fish within the United Kingdom from vessels which within the two previous months have either caught fish or have taken on board fish which has been caught within the areas set out in the Act of 1889, including the Moray Firth.375. As regards this part of the subject we are satisfied that it is definitely of advantage to the Moray Firth fishermen that the Firth should be closed, even if only partially (i.e., to British trawlers) as at present; that while the closure of the Firth is unfair to British trawlers so long as foreign trawlers are permitted to fish there, the Moray Firth is of less importance to British trawlers (especially English trawlers) than formerly; and that on balance the damage now caused to the trawling industry (especially in Scotland) by the closure of the Firth is less than that which would be caused to the Moray Firth fishermen if trawling were freely permitted in the Firth. We are therefore not in favour of the repeal of the by-law which at present prohibits trawling hi the Moray Firth.376. The question whether if the present restrictions on British trawlers are to be maintained an attempt should be made to secure their application also to foreign trawlers is more difficult. At this point, a large number of important considerations become relevant on which it would be outside our province to express an opinion, and on many of which we have taken no evidence. The first that would require consideration, if it were now proposed to enforce the by-law against foreigners, is whether in fact the regulations imposed by the by-law
made under the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889, and the. opinions of the Scottish judges referred to in paragraph 371 above, could success-fully be upheld as valid in international law. But the position as to territorial waters under international law, at the present time, is uncertain. Thus the extent of British territorial rights in the Moray Firth cannot be determined until the next International Conference on Territorial Waters, which is likely to be held a few years hence. If it was considered that such a claim could be established, further difficult questions would require decision before it would be possible to seek to enforce these by-laws against foreigners. Among these, one of the chief would be whether the importance to the Scottish fishermen of closing the Moray Firth was greater than the disadvantages from strategical and other points of view that might result from the accept-ance by this country of so wide a construction of territorial jurisdiction outside the three-mile limit. Finally, there is the question whether the retaliatory action that might be taken by other maritime countries in closing firths and bays off their own coasts to British trawlers might not inflict a much greater degree of injury on the British fishing industry as a whole than is at present inflicted by foreign trawlers operating in the Moray Firth.377. To sum up, our conclusions on this question is that the balance of advantage as between one section of the fishing industry and another (particularly in Scotland) is in favour of continuing for the time being the closure of the Moray Firth to British trawlers. The suggested exclusion of foreign trawlers from the Firth raises important questions of general policy. It has been suggested that His Majesty&apos;? Government should put forward, for the consideration of the foreign Powers concerned, proposals for modifjdng existing International Con-ventions which while securing the immediate object of closing the Firth to foreigners will avoid the possible dangers alluded to in the preceding paragraph. We consider that the practicability of this suggestion should be carefully considered by the Departments of State concerned. We think, however, that in the meantime all possible steps should be taken to ensure that the cod net fishermen adequately mark, light and watch their nets. If this were done, it would be of advantage if arrangements were made for the more intensive patrolling of the Moray Firth by the vessels of His Majesty&apos;s Fishery Protection Service, and by the cruisers of the Fishery Board for Scotland, with a view to putting a stop to the activities of any foreign trawlers who damage anchored cod-nets when properly lighted and marked-. We suggest that the necessary arrangements to this end should be made by the Fishery Board for Scotland.(b) The Firth of Clyde.378. Turning to the Firth of Clyde, we find a somewhat similar position to that which we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs in regard to the Moray Firth. The Firth of Clyde is, however, closed to trawling not by a by-law of the Scottish Fishery Board, but directly under the provisions of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889. In this case the restrictions of the Act against foreign vessels have not been enforced since 1907 ; and trawlers of foreign registration appear regularly in increasing numbers in the Firth each year.379. The position in regard to the Firth of Clyde differs in a number of important respects from that of the Moray Firth. To the man in the street, that is, apart from the lawyers&apos; point of view, the Firth of Clyde does appear to be more plainly intra fauces terra;. Viewed from this angle the case for the exercise of territorial rights is therefore much stronger than in the Moray Firth. There is, however, clearly no advantage in exercising such rights unless some definite advantage can be secured thereby. The presence of foreign vessels in the Clyde has not given rise to damage of gear as in the Moray Firth; but, as in the case of the Moray Firth, there has been disorder, though here it was caused by the illegal presence in the Firth of British trawlers.
380. Again, the case of the Firth of Clyde differs from that of the Moray Firth, in that British trawler owners are by no means indifferent to the inequitable nature of the restrictions enforced. At the present moment, they are excluded from a valuable hake fishing which is carried on by foreign vessels during the months of May, June and July. The prosecution of this- fishing cannot be said to conflict with the interests of the local fishermen. Indeed, it is held by some that it is to their advantage, since the hake feeds upon the herring, in fishing for which they are mainly engaged. Nevertheless, when in 1928 the Scottish Fishery Board, after a careful consideration of the whole position, decided that it was advisable to promulgate a by-law admitting British trawlers to certain parts of the Firth at certain times of the year strong opposition was raised by the fishermen of the Firth on the ground that their herring fishing would be ruined. The then Secretary of State for Scotland refused his confirmation of the proposed by-laws. In a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th March, 1929, he explained that the whole question of territorial waters in its inter-national aspects was at that time the subject of a general review. He -did not consider therefore that it would be expedient to take any partial action in the direction of modifying the existing restrictions on trawling which might prejudice or complicate the wider issues at stake. More-over, the flagrant contraventions of the law committed by a section of the trawlers in recent years in the Clyde area made it difficult, in his view, to justify a concession to the trawling interests concerned. He added, however, that a careful examination of the objections to the by-law revealed no evidence to support the view that the limited relaxation-tion proposed by the Fishery Board would be detrimental to the local fishing.381. As in the case of the Moray Firth the alternative courses are (i) the maintenance of the status quo, (ii)&apos; the effective closing of the Firth to foreigners, or (iii) the opening of the Firth to trawlers. Legally, there appears to be a stronger case for the second course than there is in the Moray Firth. The objections, however, to the admis-sion of trawlers to the Firth of Clyde are much weaker. The consideration-t-ion which appears to us one of the most significant is that the local fishermen do hot make use of the hake fishing. It is clearly absurd to allow this to remain a monopoly of foreign fishing vessels.382. We consider, therefore, that there are no good grounds for maintaining the status quo in the Firth of Clyde, the closure of which to British trawlers inflicts a definite hardship on the British trawling industry. We are further of the opinion that no real injury to the local fishermen would be likely to follow the removal of the present restrictions to the extent proposed by the Fishery Board for Scotland in their by-law in 1928. The men&apos;s fears on this subject are, we believe, largely misconceived, and we suggest that the Scottish Fishery Board should discuss the whole question afresh with these men with the object of dispelling their apprehensions on this account. If, as a result, the fishermen were prepared to withdraw their opposition the way would be clear for the Scottish Fishery Board to submit to the Secretary of State for Scotland for confirmation such an agreed by-law. Failing this it would be for the Departments to consider whether such a.by-law should be made notwithstanding this opposition, or whether it would be possible to secure international agreement to the effective -closing of the Firth.
YIII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.(a) CONCLUSIONS. 383.   We summarise our principal conclusions as follows: I. INTRODUCTORY.(1) The Size of the Fishing Industry.The fishing industry in England and Wales and in Scotland gives direct employment to approximately 59,000 persons. A large number of persons are employed in occupations such as the preparation or distribution of fish, the prosperity of which largely depends on that of the fishing industry.   (Paragraph 15.)(2) The Main Divisions of the Fishing Industry. The fishing industry falls into two main sections: (i) That concerned in the catching of white fish by means oftrawling;(ii) That concerned in the catching of herrings by means ofdrifting.An important cross-division is, however, introduced by the inshore fisheries, the fishermen engaged in which catch both white fish and. herrings, as well as kinds peculiar to inshore waters, e.g., salmon, oysters and lobsters.   (Paragraph 16.)II. WHITE FISH AND TRAWLING.(3) Kinds of Fish and Quantity and Value of Catch.The total quantity of white fish of British taking landed in Great Britain in 1930 was 14,147,000 cwts., of a total value of  14,765,000. The most important kinds commercially are cod, haddock, plaice and hake, which together account for about two-thirds of both the quantity and value of all white fish landed in British fishing vessels. Measured by value, about three-quarters of the fish are landed at Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood.   (Paragraphs 24-26.)(4) Fishing Grounds.The largest quantity of fish landed in 1930 was brought from the North Sea, which yielded nearly 5,000,000 cwts., mainly haddock, cod, plaice and whiting. Of the other fishing grounds, the next in order of importance in that year were Icelandic waters, from which over 3,000,000 cwts. were landed, and Bear Island and Spitzbergen, which yielded over 1,000,000 cwts.   (Paragraphs 27-29.)(5) Number of Men and Vessels Engaged in Fishing for White Fish.In 1930 the number of men in England and Wales regularly engaged in trawling was 17,726, as oompared with 19,575 in 1913. In Scotland in the same year the number of men regularly employed was 3,265, as compared with 2,850 in 1913.The number of vessels engaged in 1930 in catching white fish by various methods in England and Wales was 2,034, as compared with 2,615 in 1913. In Scotland the corresponding figure in 1930 was 830. (Paragraphs 30-34.)(Note. The foregoing figures refer to fishermen and vessels-engaged in deep-sea fishing only.)(6) Imports of White Fish.The total retained imports of white fish amounted in 1930 to a value of over  3 millions, as compared with British landings of  14f millions. Before the war imports of white fish were on a comparatively small
though growing scale, but while British takings were actually less in 1928 than in 1910, imports increased over this period four-fold. Imports increased most rapidly in the first half of the post-war decade, when British takings were stationary. Between 1926 and 1930, on the other hand, British landings showed a substantial increase, due in part to the discovery of new fishing grounds, while imports ceased to expand in any marked degree. The total consumption of white fish in this country increased steadily during the post-war decade, as the result in part of a shifting of demand from herrings, and continued to increase for a considerable period of the present trade depression. But by September 1931 a decline in consumption had become evident, reflected in a marked fall in the quantity of British landings (though not in imports) and a more than proportionate fall in price. We are thus now confronted with a situation in which the fish which the British trawling industry can market is substantially below its productive capacity. Orders are no longer being given for trawlers to be built and existing trawlers are no longer being worked at their full capacity. Owing to the unsatisfactory state of the market, British trawlers were unable to take full advantage in 1931 of the recently-discovered fishing grounds off Beau Island. The bulk of the imports of white fish, whether landed direct from fishing grounds or imported as cargo, could readily be supplied by the British trawling industry. Plaice, however, constitutes a possible exception to this rule, owing to the large volume and high quality of the imports.   (Paragraphs 121-12$.).(7) Exports of White Fish.The total exports in 1930 of white flsh, in a fresh or frozen state, amounted to 362,000 cwts., valued at  750,000; and exports of cured and salted white fish amounted to 560,000 cwts., valued at  1,073,000. (Paragraph 125.)More than half the exports in a fresh or frozen state went to France ( 395,000). This not very considerable trade is now threatened by restrictions on imports, which have recently been imposed by the French Government. Of the cured and salted exports, the greater part was accounted for by exports of cod to South American countries, particularly Brazil. In normal times this should be an expanding trade; but it has to encounter at present obstacles arising from the financial difficulties of Brazil.   (Paragraph 126.)(8) The Conditions of Employment and Remuneration.The conditions under which persons may be employed as members of crews of fishing vessels are laid down in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1895. As the result of our inquiry, we are satisfied that the provisions of that Act require amendment, in relation, in particular, to such questions as signing on and off, safety at sea, and the procedure in regard to settling sheets. (Paragraphs 44-67.) (Our recommenda-tions on this head are summarised in paragraph 38$ (1).)(9) The Present Marketing System.White fish landed at the large fishing ports is sold by public auction immediately on arrival. It is bought by port merchants acting either on their own account or as agents for Billingsgate merchants. In the former case, they may dispose of their purchases in a variety of ways. They may sell it to the merchants at Billingsgate or other wholesale markets, or they may themselves sell it in those markets through those merchants acting on commission for them. Alternatively, they may sell direct to their own customers, including institutions, hotels, restaurants, the fish-friers and retail shops. The fish may be filleted at the port for sale in cartons, or sold to a curer, a smoker or a salter. The merchants at Billingsgate and other wholesale markets in their turn dispose of their fish in various ways. They may sell direct to hotels and institutions or to the larger retailers and fish-friers; but at Billingsgate they normally sell a small part of their supplies to a middleman, known as a bummaree, whose function is to sell fish in small quantities to small retailers. (Paragraphs 68 and 69.)
(10) Railicay Transport.Fish is generally carried from the ports to inland markets by passenger train or other similar service at passenger train rates. It Is, however, sometimes carried by goods train where an advantageous Joods train service is available.   (Paragraph 73.)Having regard to all the circumstances, railway rates for the carriage of fish cannot be regarded as excessive, although they bear more heavily upon the cheaper class of fish which has of recent years been forming an increasing proportion of the total catch. The fish merchants have put forward a request that the railway authorities should reduce the minimum unit of weight charged for fish conveyed by passenger train or similar service from 1 cwt. to i cwt. We do not recommend this, having regard to the fact that when consignments of less than 1 cwt. are forwarded, the railway companies charge either the 1 cwt. rate or the appropriate parcels scale, whichever is to the advantage of the trader. Further, in order to obtain cheap rates, it is desirable that fish merchants should consign fish in large quantities, and any reduction of the minimum rate would be an inducement in the opposite direction. Fish rates are now on a lower basis than those for other perishable traffic.   (Paragraph 75.)On the question of prepayment, we think that the fishing industry would be well advised not to press for an alteration of the present ;system.*   (Paragraphs 76-77.)-(11) Billingsgate Market.The complaints made to us with regard to conditions of sale at Billingsgate fall under four heads: (a) That the seller of fish on commission does not always returnto the sender the actual price at which the fish is sold.(b) That the Billingsgate &apos;&apos; Daily Prices&apos;&apos; do not reflect with sufficient accuracy the actual prices at which the fish is sold.(c) That the number of bummarees in the Market is excessive.(d) That the arrangements for weighing, packing and grading are inadequate.   (Paragraph 81.)Our conclusions in regard to these complaints are as follows : (a) The question of sales on commission was carefully consideredby the Food Council, who pointed out that the root of the complaint lies in the fact that salesmen act both as merchants buying and selling fish on their own account and as commission salesmen on behalf of port wholesale merchants. Such a state of affairs inevitably leads to abuses. In the central food markets of Paris, salesmen are required to act as commission agents only and are prohibited from engaging in selling on their own account either in the market or elsewhere. We think that it would be of advantage if there were restrictions on somewhat similar lines in this country.   (Paragraphs 82-90.)(b) As regards Billingsgate &quot; Daily Prices,&quot; we think it important,both to the reputation of Billingsgate Market and in view of the far-reaching effect of Billingsgate prices on the fish trade as a whole, that the &quot; Daily Prices &quot; should be compiled on a basis which is not open to the objections referred to above. If necessary, legislative powers should be taken to see that this is done.   (Paragraph 91.).(c) By buying fish from the large wholesalers and splitting it up into small quantities, the bummaree meets the requirements of the purchasers, whose business is not sufficiently large to enable them to buy as much (for example) as a whole box of a particular kind of fish. Purchasers of this type are thus enabled to obtain supplies in quantities suited to their requirements and in the variety required by their type of business. For these reasons, we consider that the bummaree plays a useful role in the market which could not readily be discharged by the large wholesalers.   (Paragraph 92.)(d) There is little doubt that the methods of weighing fish in the market are very casual, but the rapidity with which catches* Note by Captain, Basil Hall. &quot; 1 am unable to associate myself with this view.&quot;
must be sent into consumption allows little time for exact&quot;, weighing and the congested conditions at Billingsgate make the weighing of all consignments difficult, if not impossible. These difficulties are enhanced by the fact that the fish is mixed with ice in the boxes. We think, however, that the trade would derive considerable advantage by making a. careful study of the steps which have been taken in recent years by other branches of the food-producing industry to improve standards of packing and grading. There was a. consensus of opinion amongst competent witnesses that the universal use of non-returnable boxes is an ideal at which to aim. Their use by the trade, however, is not likely to become widespread until their cost has been materially reduced, perhaps by standardisation and mass production. (Para-graphs 93-96.)(12) The Extension of Billingsgate Market.The need for some improvement of the wholesale fish market of Billingsgate has been put before us from various quarters with some insistence. For the last 20 years it has been apparent that the very considerable volume of trade at Billinsgate has outgrown the normal&apos;, capacity of the Market. Within the main building there has undoubtedly been a serious lack of space, causing congestion, delay and expense. Congestion is also felt on the quay-side, where cargoes, of fish arriving by water are unloaded.Three possible solutions of this problem have been proposed: (1) The provision of a subsidiary market within the London area; (2) The transfer of the market to a new site, preferably in the-vicinity of the great railway terminuses; (3) The extension of the market in its present situation.Of these methods, the first has already been proved unworkable, for when many years ago a subsidiary market was set up at Shadwell, the fish merchants refused to divide their attention and their trade between two markets. The second solution had the support of the majority of the Committee appointed by the Ministry of Food imme-diately after the war. We do not, however, consider that this suggestion is practicable, having regard to the difficulties which would have to be overcome as well as real sacrifices of capital to be made before the market could be removed from a site to which so many interests are attached.There remains the third alternative of extension on the present site. The only practicable suggestion is that the City Corporation should acquire the site of the Customs House, the latter being removed else-where. This scheme has been accepted in principle by the City Corporation and negotiations have been in progress for a number of years between the Corporation and the Office of Works, but they have come to nothing through failure to agree on the price to be paid. It is no part of our province to attempt to pronounce on the merits of a dispute, which has hitherto been unresolved, so far as it is merely a question of the terms of a commercial bargain. It is, however, part of the argument of the Corporation that the improvement of the market would benefit the fishing industry and be of advantage to the nation as a whole, and that on this ground the Office of Works ought to be accommodating in the matter of price. This seems to us. tantamount, in effect, to a claim that the national interest in the extension of Billingsgate is sufficient to justify an element of subsidy from national funds, and we have, therefore, considered how far such a claim can be made good.There are clear signs that the importance of the market as a part of the system of fish distribution is gradually diminishing. Not only is Billingsgate losing ground relatively, but, in addition, new and important developments in methods of marketing may be expected to encroach still further on its position. It is, however, possible that it is just the overcrowding of the market that is responsible for the failure of Billingsgate to obtain its share of the increasing volume of trade.
On the whole, we consider that the case is made out for the principle of public assistance for the extension of Billingsgate Market, though such assistance should not be on a larger scale than that given by tho Government for the development of other public utility undertakings. (Paragraphs 97-108.)(13) Allegations of Profiteering.From time to time allegations have been made with regard to profiteering, the control of markets by rings, and the deliberate dumping or destruction of quantities of fish for the purpose of keeping up prices. This question was carefully considered by the Food Council, whose general conclusion was that, on the average, excess profits were not being made in the trade, though well-placed shops with satisfactory turnovers made exceptionally good profits, particularly when managed by the owner. The Council also found that there was no foundation for the allegations of deliberate waste or destruction of fish for the purpose of keeping up prices.We see no reason to question the Food Councils conclusions on these points or to suppose that they are inapplicable to-day, though, no doubt, in conditions of glut a certain amount of fish is destroyed which cannot be sold at a remunerative price or perhaps at all. (Para-graphs 109-118.)(14) The Need for Further Information on Marketing.The English and Scottish Fisheries Departments have suggested to us the desirability of a comprehensive survey, to be conducted by specially appointed investigators under the auspices of both Depart-ments, into the marketing of fish and fish products in Great Britain. Our own experience confirms the need for such an investigation, but we recognise that in existing financial circumstances it would not be possible to proceed with it immediately.   (Paragraphs 130-134.)(15) Fish Preservation.The potentialities of improved methods of preservation represent a subject of great importance to the trawling industry, holding out the possibility of extending the sale of fish by cheapening its cost, improving its quality, and evening out supplies throughout the year. Important scientific work on the fundamental problems underlying fish preservation-tion is being carried out under the auspices of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and this work should be continued and expanded as opportunities allow. There is, however, both scope and need for work by the industry itself. It would be of great advantage if the industry were willing to co-operate in large-scale experimental applications of the results of research in fish preservation. It would, we believe, be a good investment for the industry if, say, the British Trawlers&apos; Federation were to establish a research association similar to those established under the scheme administered by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. (Paragraphs 135-141.)(16) New Fishing Grounds.The increased application of science to fish preservation has lengthened, and will probably continue to lengthen, the period that can elapse, without prejudice to the saleable quality of the fish, between Its catching and its marketing. To some extent, however, the value of these improvements has been off-set by the greater distances that the trawlers have now to steam in order to find suitable fishing grounds, owing to the impoverishment of the fishing grounds in the North Sea and to the keener foreign competition in the nearer grounds formerly worked by British trawlers.At an early stage of our inquiry, we were much impressed with the need for obtaining more adequate data regarding these fishing grounds, and we felt there was substance in the claims of the industry that, having regard to the large sums of capital which they have sunk in the provision of the equipment necessary to explore these grounds, it would be unreasonable to expect them to incur substantial expenditure on a survey the results of which would be embodied in published charts
and thus become available to the whole world. On this point, w&amp; submitted an Interim Report recommending His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to order forthwith the construction of a survey vessel for the purpose of surveying new fishing grounds situated between the latitude of 60 degrees north and 75 degrees north, and between longitude of 45 degrees west and 55 degrees east. This recommendation was adopted, and H.M.S. &quot; Challenger &quot; is now completed. Owing to the financial crisis, His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, felt them-selves unable at the moment to incur the expenditure that would be necessary to carry out the survey.This is less unfortunate than may appear at first sight, as the progress of the depression has served to diminish considerably the consumption of white fish. For the time being, accordingly, the existing fishing grounds are adequate to the needs of the trade. Indeed, the discovery of fresh grounds at this moment would only accentuate the condition of over-supply. This, however, is likely to prove a very transient state of things, in view of the long-period tendency for the consumption of white fish to increase. We think, therefore, that it would be desirable for the work of the survey to be put in hand as soon as financial conditions become somewhat easier and without waiting until there is an actual shortage of white fish. (Para-graphs 142-148.)III.-HERRINGS AND DRIFTING.(17) Characteristics of Herring Industry.The herring industry is primarily a Scottish one. Not only does it cover an extensive coastline, and give employment to a large number of persons in Scotland itself, but, in addition, Scottish fishermen and curers take a leading part in the English fishings. Its situation and prospects present problems far more serious than those of the trawling industry. While the prosperity of the latter has until recently been growing, the herring industry since the war has had to face, a period of low prices, contracted markets both at home and abroad, a decline in the numbers employed, and a general deterioration in the means-of production.   (Paragraphs 149-150.)(18) Fishing Grounds and Seasons.The two principal fishings are the Scottish summer and the East Anglian autumn fishings. The former is prosecuted chiefly in the area from Shetland to the waters off the coast of Aberdeenshire. The East. Anglian autumn fishing is conducted off Yarmouth and Lowestoft and is by far the most important of the English herring fishings. (Para-graphs 151-157.)(19) Personnel and Equipment.The number of those employed in the herring industry has declined in a marked fashion since pre-war days. There is no doubt that the hard times through which the industry has been passing haye discouraged the younger generation from entering it, and the average age of the fishermen, especially in some of the smaller creeks, is fairly high. It is probably in this way, rather than by the transference of men to other industries for which, indeed, there is little opportunity  that the numbers of those engaged in the industry as a whole have declined from 20,500 in 1914 to probably under 16,000 to-day. The Scottish herring fisherman, like the inshore fisherman in England, lives in small, scattered communities, never rising above towns of 12,000 population, and, as a general rule, the men of these communities show great reluctance to fish co-operatively. In the main each boat stands by itself, and there is no pooling of results and no possibility of a loss on one boat being balanced by the success of others, as in the case of a company owning a number of vessels. The profit-sharing system prevails both in England and Scotland. In the latter country, the fishermen are usually also the owners of the nets and the boats. In spite of the objections to this system, it is of value in giving the men a personal interest in the success of the voyage. This is particularly necessary in the drifting industry; for not only are the boats away
from home ports and out of control of the owner (where they are shore-owned) for months on end, but the irregular nature of the herring fishermen&apos;s work also makes some such stimulus necessary. (Para-graphs 158-167.)(20) Shore Workers and their Earnings.Besides those directly engaged in the industry as fishermen, there is a large population dependent on it consisting principally of those employed in curing yards in gutting and packing herrings, of whom the majority are women. The number of these shows a noticeable decline from the pre-war level.   (Paragraphs 168-173.)(21) The Equipment of the Drifting Industry and its Productive Po wer.The vessel principally used in the capture of herrings is the steam drifter. The pursuit of the shoals rarely takes the boats more than 60 miles from the port from which at any moment they are working, so that the type required is not as large and powerful as the trawler whose voyage may last a month. The numbers of the fleet have declined from 3,131 in 1914 to 2,142 in 1928, but, owing to the rise in the number of motor vessels of greater efficiency than the old sailing vessels, the productive power of the fleet has not declined proportionately.  (Paragraphs 174-181.)In .the years immediately preceding the war, the herring fleet expanded rapidly, on account, mainly, of the introduction of mechanical propulsion. The war, however, destroyed the equilibrium between the productive capacity of the herring industry and the extent of its markets. The latter were disorganised and, in particular, the Russian market was completely lost and has never been regained. The embarrassment of the industry so caused has been intensified by the marked fall in the home consumption of herrings. (Paragraphs 182-185.)(22) The Consumption of Herrings in Great Britain.The position of the herring industry would be much less serious-than it is, were it not that, in addition to the contraction in exports (which constitute its chief market), there has been a decline in home consumption also. In fact, if the home market had been maintained at the level of the years immediately before the war, the excess to-day in capacity for fishing would be relatively small. One of the causes of this decline is due to the fact that during the last 20 years there has been a marked shifting of demand from herring to white fish, so that the increased consumption of the latter has been very largely at the expense of the former.   (Paragraphs 186-192.)(23) The Kippering Industry.The kippering branch of tne industry has suffered in the same way as the trade in fresh herrings. The competition of white fish to the disadvantage of kippers is marked in the case of the introduction of wet cod fillets, cleaned and ready for cooking, and also of smoked cod fillets. Some of the causes alleged for the arrested development of this industry are the improved preparation of white fish for sale, the high rate of the profit required by the retailer, the kippering of Norwegian herring in the latter part of April and May, when the fish are in poor condition, thereby spoiling the market for good kippers when these are available, and the comparatively recent introduction of an artificially-coloured kipper (&quot; the dyed kipper &quot;), concerning which there is much controversy within the trade. The last development distinguishes the position of the kippering industry from that in fresh herrings. It represents a definite effort to make the product of the former industry more marketable by improving its appearance. The colouring process is claimed to be completely innocuous to those who subsequently consume the kippers, but, related to it and to a considerable extent no doubt occasioned by it, there has been a change in the materials used for the process of smoking. In order to test the method at present employed, a series of investigations has just been begun at the Torry Research Station, Aberdeen.
The development of improved methods of kippering will, however, he of little use if the public taste for this commodity is destroyed by the marketing of inferior cures, as we believe to have been to some extent the case in recent years. The establishment of a national system of grading and marketing under the recent Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Amendment Act, 1931, should do much to overcome this difficulty by enabling the public to discriminate between good and bad cures. These problems are in turn related to the question of advertisement. It is, therefore, desirable that the kippering industry should not lag behind the trawling industry if the expansion of the demand for fish as a whole, rather thair the transfer of demand from one section of the industry to another, is to be achieved. (Para-graphs 193-199.)(24) The Canning of Herrings.In recent years, the demand for tinned foods has been increasing in view of the many and varied advantages that they offer. Serious efforts have been made by the herring trade to participate in this trade. At the present time tinned herrings find their chief market overseas. In 1928, 123,000 cwts. of canned herrings were exported, chiefly to West Africa and Australia. There is a large market for herring and other fish canned in tomato sauce in India, Malaya and the Far East, but at present it is supplied by the canning factories in California. Any attempt to get a substantial footing in the home market would involve very keen competition with other tinned products which have been long established. The British canner has, however, a number of advantages. Copious supplies of his raw material are available, though he is subject to the disadvantage that the supply is seasonal; and, therefore, under existing conditions, the large capital outlay on plant has to earn a return during a part of the year only. (Paragraphs 200-202.)(25) Imports of Herrings.The bulk of the imported herrings arrive in the early spring and are converted into kippers when there is only a small supply of British herrings available for kippering. The imports are thus for the most part not in direct competition with the British drifting industry. As would naturally be expected, in view of this consideration, the imports of herrings have declined in recent years along with the decline in home consumption. Actually, indeed, the imports of herrings now represent a somewhat smaller proportion of the estimated home con-sumption than was the case before the war.Inasmuch as herrings are chiefly imported to meet the needs of the kippering industry at a special season of the year, the imports of herrings present different considerations from those which we have discussed in connection with possible restrictions on the import of white fish. It is, however, claimed that the kippering of Norwegian herrings in the latter part of April and May results in kippers of poor condition and thus tends to spoil the market for good kippers when these are available. In so far as this claim is well-founded, the restric-tion of the import of herrings might be of benefit to the British herring industry. It is, further, claimed that if the price obtainable for herrings in these months were increased by these means, the Scottish drifters might be able to compete successfully in the supply of these herrings, though it may be doubted whether the Scottish industry could in practice maintain a supply of sufficient regularity to meet the needs of the kipperers. The above two arguments are not wholly consistent with one another. It should also be remembered that herrings and kippers are largely consumed by the poorer section of the community. On balance, therefore, the case for restriction appears to be a weak one.  (Paragraphs 203-20$.)(26) The Export of Pickled Herrings.Pickled herrings form by far the greatest proportion of the export trade, and it is here that we have to notioe the most serious decline. In pre-war years the principal markets for British-cured herring were Russia, whioh imported directly 1,100,000 barrels of herrings, valued
at  1,625,000; Germany, which took 1,150,000 barrels valued at  1,650,000, and the United States, which took 100,000 barrels, valued at  250,000. Since the war, Soviet Russia, her territories diminished by the Baltic States, now independent, has been only an occasional buyer of moderate quantities at irregular intervals. In Russia, quality is at the moment of little importance, hence nearly the whole of that part of their supply of herrings which is not obtained from the fisheries in the volga and Caspian is drawn from Norway. Since the war Germany has, however, bought on the average about 600,000 barrels, valued at  1,200,000, a decline of about 500,000 barrels. The greater part of this decline is, however, due to the fact that she no longer re-exports to Russia. In the same period the Baltic States have taken an average of 613,000 barrels annually, valued at  1,250,000.Notwithstanding these difficulties, the export trade up till 1929 showed a noticeable improvement, though this was not maintained in 1930. Owing to a combination of adverse circumstances, the year 1931 has proved almost disastrous, both to the fishermen and to the curers and exporters. The Scottish season was marked this year by a serious shortage of fish and the landings amounted to only 492,425 crans, as compared with 771,216 in 1930. The East Anglian season opened after the suspension of gold payments by this country. In the resulting conditions of uncertainty, curers and exporters in this country and importers on the Continent, were alike unwilling to enter into large commitments. As a result, although by agreement the start of curing operations was delayed until the 12th October, very low prices have been paid, the average per cran being only about 17s. 6d., which is certainly less than the cost of production. It is certain that very few vessels will show a profit from the season&apos;s fishing. (Paragraphs 206-211.)(27) The Export of Red Herrings.A small export trade (6 per cent, approximately of the total produc-tion) is done with Mediterranean countries (mainly Italy, Greece and Egypt), and with France and Belgium for re-export to them, in what are known as red herrings. Financial uncertainties in these markets make long credits hazardous, and any prospect of improvement in the trade will depend upon an increase of prosperity in the countries with which it is carried on.   (Paragraph 212.)(28) The Export Of-Klondyked Herrings.The export of so-called Klondyked herrings, i.c, fresh or slightly salted herrings, covers about 9 per cent, of the total production of herrings. This trade is almost entirely to Germany, where the fish is either retailed fresh or sent to factories for smoking and tinning. The trade, though neither a large nor a growing one, has been of considerable assistance to the industry since the war. It has been greatly stimulated by the development in Germany of the process, known as marinading.   (Paragraph 213.)(29) The Disposal of the Surplus for Export.The heavy falling away of the export market, which has not been met by a corresponding reduction in the size of the fleet, has resulted in low prices and poor returns to fishermen and curers. The disproportion between the markets at present available and the catching power of the fleet, has in recent years generally resulted in 100,000 barrels of herrings being cured in excess of the quantity that can be marketed at a remunerative price. For these reasons it is desirable that curing should not begin too early or oontinue too late in the season. The immature herrings which are caught in the earliest days of the season do not keep when cured for more than a limited time and, therefore, any surplus at this stage has an adverse effect upon the market for herrings later in the year. Similarly, over-production at the end of the season means that a surplus remains on the hands of the exporters which must be sold in the following year at a poor price, before the newly-oaught herrings can be marketed.
We are aware of the difficulties which have in the past defeated schemes which aimed at maintaining prices by the control of produc-tion. In the present instance, however, the British trade is in a very strong position. Since the sources of potential competition are so few and so inconsiderable, we consider that much would be gained by the exercise of effective control over the production of cured herring in this country. Our recommendations on this point are summarised in par-graph 384 (7) below.   (Paragraphs 214-220.)(30) The Age of the Fleet.A further problem which concerns the herring industry is the replacement and repair of the drifter fleet. The bulk of the Scottish portion of the fleet was constructed in the decade before the war, and its average age is now between 22 and 23 years. Moreover, the impoverishment of the fishermen, brought about by the depressed state of the industry since the war, has made it impossible for most of them to maintain their vessels in an efficient condition, and it is only in a small minority of cases that any provision has been made for replace-ment. Deterioration has also taken place in their gear. It has been strongly represented to us by witnesses who have appeared on behalf of Scottish fishermen that State assistance is required for the replace-ment of worn-out vessels, for the reconditioning of others and for the supply of new nets and gear. The plight of the Scottish fishermen deserves sympathetic consideration. But the main difficulty which the industry has to face springs from the excessive catching power of the fleet in the face of marked contraction in the export market since the war. The chief necessity of the industry is to succeed in adapting Itself, little by little, to this contraction of demand. Any action, therefore, which would tend to delay or even to reverse this process of readjustment would be injurious to the prospects of the industry. An important matter for consideration is the obsolescence of the fleet, not with regard to age, but with regard to the type of vessel employed. The steam drifter is in general an efficient instrument for herring fishing, but in comparison with present earnings, it is expensive both to build and to maintain and operate. The circumstances seem to point to the necessity for adopting a type of vessel less costly to construct and to operate. A return to the old sailing boat cannot be seriously contemplated, and the only practical alternative by which economies can be effected is the adoption of motor craft. We think it desirable that during the next few years experiments with new types of vessel should continue to be made; and as soon as financial conditions permit we think that this offers a proper field for State assistance. It is possible that a demand will arise in the future for State assistance in the form of loans towards the provision of new boats. We think that such assistance should only take the form of loans to responsible co-operative organisations of fishermen or to public utility enterprises of an approved type designed to minister to the needs of the different fishing communities.   (Paragraphs 221-232.)IY. THE INSHORE FISHERIES.(31) Diversity of Character of the Inshore Fisheries.Inshore fishermen are, generally speaking, those who use vessels incapable of working at a distance from port greater than 10 or 12 miles. But no single type of fishing and no dearly defined class of fisherman falls within the limits of such a description. To a large extent inshore fishing in England and Wales, and in Scotland, is no more than an occasional occupation. Even in the case of those solely occupied in it, the men, who for a large part of the year are fishing close to shore, may often go much further afield. The problems, moreover, of the inshore fisheries turn very largely upon the question of organisation at ports. The boats are owned by one man as a rule and carry a crew of two or three hands paid by a share of the catch. The largest are often owned jointly by two men and the crew may consist of as many as five. They use all the principal methods of fishing; but in every case, whatever the size of the boat or the method of fishing, they are never long absent from port, but, as a rule, land
their fish every day. The consequent freshness of their catch is the only point on which, as a producer of white fish, the inshore fisherman has an advantage over the large steam fishing companies. In other respects, he is a marginal producer with little bargaining power. It is one of the outstanding weaknesses of his position that when fish is scarce and prices are good, he lands little or nothing; his catch only comes to market when favourable weather conditions have already brought about a plentiful supply of fish from other sources. Fishing has had its industrial revolution as have other crafts and occupations. But, perhaps, nowhere else, except in agrioulture, has the small producer survived so persistently.   (Paragraphs 233-236.)(32) Number of Fishermen and  Vessels engaged in the Inshore Fisheries.The number of inshore fishermen in England and Wales in 1928, including those only occasionally so occupied, was 12,279, with a further 2,218 who were engaged partly in inshore and partly in deep-sea fishing. Comparing the figures for 1928 with those for 192$, we find that inshore fishermen have decreased by 619, and those partly engaged in inshore fishing by 753. A comparison of the figures for 1928 with those for 1913 suggests that during that period the numbers engaged in the inshore fisheries declined by 7,632. (Paragraphs 237-2$0.)&quot; According to figures supplied to us by the Fishery Board for Scotland, there are approximately 10,000 fishermen engaged in the inshore fisheries in that country. Of these, a large number fish for herring during part of the year; during the remainder they fish for white fish in inshore waters. A large part of them are engaged in fishing in the Moray Firth.   (Paragraphs 251 and 372.)(33) Number of Vessels.In 1928 there were approximately 7,000 inshore fishing vessels in England and Wales, a decline of about 1,000 as compared with 192$. In Scotland vessels of a similar kind numbered in 1930 about 3,950, as compared with about $,750 in 192$.   (Paragraphs 2$2-2$$.)(34) Regulation of the Inshore Fisheries.Sea fishing off the coast of England and Wales is regulated by the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, which gives power to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, to create Sea Fisheries Districts and to constitute local Sea Fisheries Committees for the regulation of each district.   (Paragraphs 2$5-2$6.)Although by-laws made by these Committees are subject to confirmation by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, he has no power to initiate by-laws or to revoke or modify those which may have become obsolete. The absence of such power is attended by obvious disadvantages, there being cases to-day in which for one reason or another by-laws have proved unsatisfactory in practice. (Para-graphs 2$7-2$8.) Our recommendation on this subject is summarised in paragraph 38$ (8) below.In Scotland the system under which the sea fisheries are administered is more centralised than in England and Wales, the Fishery Board for Scotland having power to issue by-laws regulating fishing in Scottish waters.   (Paragraph 2$9.)Kinds and Quantities of Fish caught by the Inshore Fishermen.-(35) Demersal and Pelagic.The landings of white fish and pelagic fish by inshore fishermen in England and Wales amounted in 1928 to 158,000 and 161,000 cwts. respectively. The figures for these classes of fish taken by inshore fishermen in Scotland in 1930 are 3$6,000 and $38,000 cwts. respectively. In England and Wales there has been a continuous decline in the quantity of white fish landed since 1920, amounting in :all to over 30 per cent.   (Paragraphs 250-25$.)
(36) Salmon.About 2,000 men are engaged in the Scottish Salmon fisheries. These differ from the other sections of the inshore fisheries in that they may only be worked by the owners of the fisheries or by persons holding leases from them. Further, the men engaged are not inde-pendent fishermen, but are wage-earners employed in the Salmon Season. Less than ha!f of them engage in Sea fishing during the close time for salmon fishing. Production of salmon has declined greatly in recent years, and imports consisting mainly of canned salmon, but also, to some extent, of Canadian frozen salmon, have been increasing. Imports of the former class do not compete with British salmon owing to the great difference between salmon when fresh and when canned. For similiar reasons it is doubtful to what extent frozen salmon competes with fresh salmon. In the course of our inquiry it was suggested to us that some system of marking would become desirable as the trade in frozen salmon increased, in order that such salmon should be readily distinguishable from fresh salmon of British taking. This suggestion has now been realised by an order made in 1931 under the Merchandise Marks and Imported Goods Act. (Paragraph 255.)Salmon is taken chiefly by fly and bag nets set along the shore and, to a lesser extent, by sweep nets in estuaries and rivers. The general policy in recent years has been towards the limitation of netting any narrow waters where too great a control of the run of fish may be exercised and the reservation of the rivers for the repro-duction of the fish and incidentally for angling. The weight of salmon taken annually in Scotland in recent years has been estimated by the Scottish Fishery Board at 32,000 cwts. Except in a few cases where voluntary returns are made, the Fishery Board for Scotland do not receive any statistics of the catch of salmon and the various District Boards are in no better position. Attention has been drawn in many official reports to this matter, which has long been a source of difficulty. Practically the whole of the catch is consumed fresh in Great Britain and there is little export trade.   (Paragraph 256.)In the last 50 years there has been a decline in the salmon fisheries in Scotland which has been largely due to the operation of the following clauses : (i) Pollution.(ii) Over-netting.(iii) Obstructions, such as dams and weirs, which prevent the ascent of the fish to the spawning grounds.The effective handling of these problems is seriously hampered by the inadequacy of the existing powers of the Scottish Fishery Board. (Paragraphs 257-259.) Our recommendations on this head are summarised in paragraphs 38$ (9) below.The salmon fisheries of England and Wales, while not as extensive as those of Scotland, are, nevertheless, of considerable importance. As in the case of Scotland, there are no means of ascertaining accurately the quantity taken annually, but we estimate this at between 16,000 and 18,000 cwts. a year. Broadly speaking, these fisheries raise much the same problems as in Scotland, but the Salmon and Fresh Water Fisheries Act, 1923, provides means for meeting: these difficulties of a more up-to-date kind than anything so far obtained in Scotland. This Act contains general provisions designed to limit as far as possible the evil effects of pollution, over-fishing, and obstructions to the ascent of the fish to the spawning grounds, and provides the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries with adequate powers to deal with these matters so far as this can be achieved by Government action.   (Paragraphs 261-264.)Shell Fish.Fisheries for shell fish although distributed unevenly round the coast are a valuable source of income to those engaged in them. (Paragraph 265.)
&apos;(37) Lobsters and Crabs.Lobster fisheries play an important part in the economy of the inshore fisheries both in England and in Scotland, where they are caught mainly by crofter fishermen of the north and north-west. The number of lobsters taken in Great Britain in 1930 amounted to 1,820,000 at a value of  119,000. The corresponding figures for crabs was 8,900,000 at a value of  84,000. Adequate regulations are in force throughout the country for the protection of immature lobsters and crabs.   (Paragraphs 266-268.)(38) Mussels and Cockles.The quantity and value of mussels and cockles of British taking in 1930 were for mussels 152,000 cwts. at a value of  29,000, and for cockles 187,000 cwts. at a value of  38,000.   (Paragraph 289.)By far ths most important question in regard to shell-fish is that of pollution, as the shell-fish beds are very largely subject to con-decontamination  by sewage. In several places they are virtually closed, so far- as concerns distribution of shell-fish for human consumption. The general effect of existing legislation is to prohibit the distri-bution from contaminated areas for sale for human consumption unless they have been relaid for a specified time or subjected to a process of sterilising or cleansing approved by the appropriate Government Departments. Most of the layings conditionally closed are public layings, and the persons who are financially affected by the closure are fishermen who rely on the taking of shell-fish to provide a part of their livelihood for some seasons of the year. As a rule they would have neither the capital necessary for the construction of cleansing or sterilising works, nor the business experience required for their management. Local authorities appear, however, to be suitable bodies to undertake the necessary work, which is similar to that which they already perform under the Public Health Acts. (Paragraphs 271-276.)The imports of mussels (53,053 cwts. in 1930, valued at  13,442), while negligible in relation to the total volume of British imports, represent about a quarter of the home consumption of mussels, and it is clearly anomalous to take elaborate precautions to safeguard the con-sumer against the danger of eating polluted mussels, if gathered at home, when no such precautions are applied to the substantial part of the supply which is gathered abroad. The Fishmongers&apos; Company keep a watch on imported mussels marketed in Billingsgate and the surrounding area in London to which their powers extend. They are also frequently consulted by local sanitary authorities with regard to musseis exposed for sale in provincial markets and they undertake free of charge the bacteriological examination of samples of such mussels which are sent to them by medical officers of health responsible for the control of such markets. The supervision thus exercised by the Fishmongers&apos; Company covers, however, oniy a portion of the supply of imported mussels, and necessarily falls short of an adequate system of control. A drastic but simple remedy might be the prohibition of the importation of mussels, unless subjected to an approved cleansing process after their arrival in this country. It must be borne in mind, however, that while the greater part of the imported mussels comes from the Netherlands, rather more than one-third comes from the Irish Free State, so that it would be necessary to extend the obligation of cleansing to imports from the Irish Free State, if it were to be fully effective for its purpose. It would, however, be desirable to consult the Free State authorities before imposing such a restriction, and it might be possible for the appropriate departments of the two countries to agree upon mutually satisfactory arrangements which by ensuring the cleanliness of mussels gathered for export might obviate the neoessity for any further process of cleansing. We think it the more important, from the standpoint of public health, that there should be adequate provisions to ensure the quality of imported mussels, in that it is difficult, so long as polluted mussels can be brought in from abroad, to obtain the impetus necessary to provide cleansing apparatus for mussels gathered at home. (Paragraph .281.) Our recommendations on this point are summarised in paragraph 384 (11) below.
J04(89) Oysters.Although the products of British oyster fisheries command a-deservedly high reputation for excellence, a continuous and remarkable-decline has taken place in their output in the last thirty years. As recently as 1921, over 31 million British oysters were gathered, while in 1930 this figure had shrunk to under 7 million. As a corollary, there has been a great increase in recent years in the number of oysters-imported both for direct consumption and for relaying. (Para-graphs 282-283.)Sewage pollution has contributed towards this decline, an important element in which has also been the continuous succession of summers since 1920 in which conditions have been unfavourable for breeding. Good natural spatfalls on English beds are now rare, and young brood has to be imported in considerable quantities from abroad. Important work has been carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who have devised a system for the cleaning of oysters. They are also engaged in research on a practical method of breeding oysters in tanks and hope that the stage will shortly be reached at which the process can be applied commercially.   (Paragraphs 284-285.)In addition to private beds belonging to companies engaged in raising oysters, there are also a number of public oyster fisheries at various places round the coast the productivity of which has in most, cases become very small. If such beds are to be successfully restored, it is essential that they should be placed in the hands of a permanent: body by the grant either of an order for a &quot; several Fishery,&quot; to a. private firm or a co-operative society of local fishermen, or of a &quot;regulating order&quot; to a local authority, e.g., a District Council or a Sea Fisheries Committee, with power to charge tolls, issue licences, and enforce conservation measures. The fishermen have, however, on previous occasions shown strong opposition to proposals to grant concessions to public or private bodies for this purpose in spite of the fact that an area under private cultivation, besides providing employ-ment, is likely to improve the productivity of public beds in the vicinity by a natural process of propagation. At the same time, they themselves have hitherto lacked the experience and the funds-necessary for the formation of an organisation capable of maintaining; the beds in a productive condition.   (Paragraphs 286-291.)The Problems of the Inshore Fishermen.(40) Marketing Difficulties and the Need for Co-operation.The inshore fishermen are severely handicapped by the extreme individualism of their methods, by their lack of capital and by the small scale on which they work. In considering their position, it is important to draw a sharp distinction between those engaged in obtaining kinds of fish peculiar to inshore waters, such as salmon and shellfish, for which a steady demand may be expected, and the larger number who only catch the same kinds of fish as those obtained in the deep-sea fisheries. Inshore fishermen of the latter class cannot hope to compete on level terms with the steam trawler industry. The natural remedy would be an increased measure of co-operation on their part, not only in the buying of provisions and gear, but also in the sale of fish. The Fisheries Organisation Society, established in 1914, has done much to foster co-operation among fishermen. Its progress has been hindered by various causes, chief among which are the natural conservatism of the fishermen and their mistrust of anything which appears to restrict their independence. The economic position of the man engaged in obtaining luxury fish, such as salmon or shellfish, is much stronger as, unlike the inshore fisherman who catches white fish, he is not faced with competition from a highly organised industry possessed of large capital resources. None the less, this class of inshore fisherman also is faced with serious difficulties, due, in the main, to the individualism of his methods. Here, also, co-operation, once established, might be expected to secure a better price for the fisherman. (Paragraphs 295-301.)
Valuable work is being done by the Fisheries Organisation Society, and the scope of its activities could be enlarged with great advantage to the inshore fisherman working from the larger inshore fishing ports. Generally, the value of its work would be enhanced if it were brought into still closer relation with the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.   (Paragraph 302.)(41) The Provision of Boats and Gear.We have given careful consideration to the question whether further assistance should be given to the inshore fisherman for the provision of boats and gear on the lines adopted by the Government at various times since the war. But the position has altered since the time when these measures were instituted. It is not now a question of furnishing the fisherman with the means necessary to the resumption of activity after a period of enforced idleness. The difficulties of the inshore fisheries are very largely difficulties of marketing; it is the problem of finding a market where a fair price can be obtained for fish caught in small quantities and little variety. Until the difficulty of securing an adequate return for the fish the men catch has been satisfactorily dealt with, there can be little wisdom in the sinking of fresh capital in expenditure on equipment.   (Paragraphs 303-306.)V.-HARBOURS.(42) Harbours in England and Wales.The concentration of the steam trawling industry at a smali number of ports in England and Wales has resulted in pressure on dock and harbour accommodation. As the result of this concentration and of the increase in the total landings, the accommodation at some of the ports has become inadequate, and is now in process of reconstruction, in some cases with assistance under the Development (Loan Guaran-tees and Grants) Act, 1929.Many small fishery harbours have received assistance from the Development Fund. The works covered by such grants consist of the construction and repair of breakwaters, the improvement of landing facilities, and the provision of motor winches to facilitate the beaching of boats. The harbours which have received assistance are in the north-east of England and in Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. Our general conclusion is that wherever harbour authorities have sufficient funds at their disposal, the facilities provided are adequate to meet the needs of the fishing population. This, however, is not the case with the inshore fishing ports. The harbour authorities of the latter are largely composed of local fishermen and often lack the financial resources and the administrative and financial experience that are necessary for the proper management of the harbours. Many of them are much in arrsar with the repayment of the loans which they have received from the Development Commissioners for the improvement of their harbour works. The weakness of harbour authorities of this type was shown in 1929, when the Development Commissioners found it necessary, in the case of five such authorities in England and Wales, to remit debts amounting to over  15,000 which were clearly irrecoverable. (Paragraphs 307-321.) We have considered several possible methods of dealing with this situation, and our recommenda-tions are summarised in paragraph 384 (14) below.(48) Scottish Harbours.The Scottish trawling fleets are based on commercial ports such as Aberdeen, Leith, Granton, and Dundee. The main centre is Aberdeen, where substantial improvements are at present in progress. The ports from which the herring and inshore fishing are carried on are of small size, ranging from hamlets to towns not exceeding 12,000 inhabitants, and the majority of the harbours were originally
constructed for the small boats employed at the fishing up to about SO years ago. Since then, the fishing fleet has been revolutionised by the introduction of a much larger type of vessel. Since the establishment of the Development Fund in 1909 many improvement schemes have been carried out both at the herring landing ports and at the home ports of the drifters. The war and the depression in the herring industry which followed it prevented the completion of the schemes which had been planned and the execution of other necessary improvements, and involved many of the harbours in a load of debt beyond their power to bear. Measures have, however, been taken or instituted by His Majesty&apos;s Government which will materially relieve the debt situation and will lead to substantial improvements of the conditions of the harbours.   (Paragraphs 323-329.)VI__RESEARCH.The main divisions of research in relation to the problems of the fishing industry are (a) marine research dealing with living fish and their environment and (b) research into methods of preserving fish from the time of capture to the time when it reaches the consumer, and (c) research into the design and equipment of fishing vessels. (Paragraph 331.)(44) Marine Research Deep-Sea Investigations.Deep sea research is conducted on an international basis through the Permanent International Council for the Exploration of.the Sea, a scientific organisation founded in 1902 upon which moot of the fishing nations of Europe are represented. Area Committees allot to the different nations their share in the programme. Remarkable progress has been made by the two Fisheries Departments since work was resumed in this country after the break caused by the war. They have been greatly assisted by the advice given by the Advisory Committee on Fishery Research of the Development Commission which co-ordinates their research work. They each possess a scientific staff, well-equipped laboratories, a research vessel of the large steam trawler type, and a smaller motor vessel for inshore work. As regards personnel engaged in fishery research, the English Depart-ment is adequately staffed for the work allotted to it; but we under-stand that the Fishery Board for Scotland are handicapped in their research work by the small size of their scientific and technical staff. (Paragraphs 332-342.)(45) Marine Research Inshore Research.Inshore research conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries mainly at Conway has been directed towards devising a method of cleansing polluted mussels and oysters. In each case, a process has been evolved and only awaits application by planters. Important experimental work has also been carried out with a view to devising a process for breeding oysters in tanks. We hope that in spite of the financial difficulties of the present time funds will continue to be provided on an adequate scale for Marine Research, both Deep-Sea and Inshore.   (Paragraphs 343-348.)(46) Research on Fish Preservation.The transport, storage and treatment of fish subsequent to its catching is the province of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which spends about  11,400 annually on this service. The Departments activities are mainly concentrated on the Torry Research Station, Aberdeen, where experimental work is carried on&quot; in regard to the preservation of fish for consumption and on such processes as salting, smoking, and the extraction of fish oils.  (Paragraphs 349-366.)
(47) Research into the Design and Equipment of Fishing Vessels.Another type of research to which we attach importance is that directed to the discovery of improvements in the design and equipment of fishing vessels. In both cases such investigations have been chiefly concerned with tests of the catching and releasing power of various nets. Such investigations are carried on by both Fisheries Depart-ments. Admirable facilities for carrying out investigations into the design of fishing vessels exist at the National Physical Laboratory, Teidington.   (Paragraphs 367-369.)YIL-MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS.(48) The Moray Firth.A difficult situation has existed for many years in the Moray Firth owing to its partial closing to trawling under the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889. Acting on the powers conferred upon them by this Act, the Fishery Board for Scotland made a by-law closing the Firth to trawling. It was not long, however, before difficulties were experienced in its application to foreign trawlers. Litigation took place in the High Court in Scotland, which decided, as a matter of construc-tion, that the Act could be enforced against all persons of whatever nationality. Shortly afterwards, however, the situation was transformed by the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1907, on representations received from the Norwegian Government, to release the foreign skippers then in prison in this country and to discontinue the prosecution of foreigners for offences under the Act. In the twenty-four years that have elapsed since this decision was taken in 1907, no change has taken place in the legal position apart from the passing of the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Act, 1909, which prohibits the landing or sale of fish within the United Kingdom from vessels which within the two previous months have caught fish or have taken on board fish which has been caught within the areas set out in the Act of 1889, including the Moray Firth. The position thus is that British trawlers are excluded from the Firth, although trawling by foreign vessels is permitted.Our conclusion on this question is that the balance of advantage as between one section of the fishing industry and another (particularly in Scotland) is in favour of continuing, for the time being, the closure of the Moray Firth to British trawlers. The exclusion of foreign trawlers from the Firth, if attempted, would raise important questions of general policy. It has been suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should put forward, for the consideration of the foreign Powers concerned, proposals for modifying existing International Conventions which, while securing the immediate object of closing the Firth to foreigners, will avoid the possible dangers alluded to in the preceding paragraph. We consider that the practicability of this suggestion should be carefully considered by the Departments of State concerned. We think, however, that in the meantime all possible steps should be taken to ensure that the cod-net fishermen adequately mark, light and watch their nets. If this were done, it would be of advantage if arrangements were made for the more intensive patrolling of the Moray Firth by the vessels of H.M. Fishery Protection Service, and by the cruisers of the Fishery Board for Scotland, with a view to putting a stop to the activities of any foreign trawlers who damage anchored cod-nets when properly lighted and marked. We suggest that the necessary arrangements to this end should be made by the Fishery Board for Scotland.   (Paragraphs 370-377.)(49) The Firth of Clyde.The Firth of Clyde is closed to trawling under the provisions of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889. In this case also the restriction-tions of the Act against foreign vessels have not been enforced since 1907; and trawlers of foreign registration appear regularly in increasing numbers in the Firth each year. The alternative courses are: (i) the maintenance of the status quo, (ii) the effective closing of the Firth to foreigners or (iii) the opening of the Firth to trawlers.
Legally, there appears to be a stronger case for the second course than there is in the Moray Firth. The objections, however, to the admission of trawlers to the Firth of Clyde are much weaker. The consideration which /appears to us one of the most significant is that the local fishermen do not make use of the valuable local hake fishing. It is clearly absurd to allow this to remain a monopoly of foreign fishing vessels.There are no good grounds for maintaining the status quo in the Firth of Clyde, the closure of which to British trawlers inflicts a definite hardship on the British trawling industry. Further, no real injury to the local fishermen would be likely to follow the removal of the present restrictions to the extent proposed by the Fishery Board for Scotland in their by-law in 1928. The men&apos;s fears on this subject are, we believe, largely misconceived. If, as a result of renewed discussion with the Fishery Board for Scotland, the fishermen were prepared to withdraw their opposition, the way would be clear for the Fishery Board for Scotland to submit to the Secretary of State for Scotland for confirmation such an agreed by-law. Failing this, it would be for the Departments to consider whether such a by-law should be made notwithstanding this opposition, or whether it would be possible to secure international agreement to the effective closing of the Firth.   (Paragraphs 378-382.)(b) RECOMMENDATIONS. 384.   We summarise our recommendations as follows: I. WHITE FISH AND TRAWLING.(1) Conditions of Employment and Remuneration in Trawlers.(a) That Parliament should be invited to amend the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, in relation to the employment of fishermen as members of crews of fishing vessels in the following respects: (i) It should be made compulsory for the signing on and off ofthe crews of fishing vessels to take place at Board of Trade offices in the presence of a Marine Superintendent or his Deputy.(ii) It should be made compulsory for owners to give to each member of the crew of a fishing vessel who is paid partly by share in the profits a detailed settling sheet in the form now furnished to skippers and mates.(iii) It should be made compulsory for the owner of a fishingvessel to furnish to the Marine Superintendent a certified true copy of the settling sheet issued to the skipper, master and crew. Failure to do so should be made an offence subject to a substantial fine.(iv) The Board of Trade should be given such powers as may benecessary to enable Marine Superintendents to satisfy themselves that settling sheets submitted to them represent a true statement of the cost of a voyage and of the proceeds therefrom. Superintendents should be empowered to make such inquiries from time to time and to take any necessary action against the owners, without waiting for complaints to be received.(v) The requirements in regard to the provision of life-savingappliances on fishing vessels should be revised so as to be applicable to modern fishing vessels in modern conditions and power should be given to the Board of Trade to vary them from time to time, as circumstances require.(Note. The amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 189-1. recommended above should apply not only to fishermen engaged in trawlers, but also to fishermen working in herring drifters, etc., to the same extent that the law in its present form applies to the latter class of fisherman.)
(b) That Parliament should be asked to confer upon the Board of Trade power to prescribe by Order in cases of ports where they consider such a course desirable that the sale by auction of trawled fish which affects the settling sheets between owners, skippers and crews should only be conducted by salesmen independent of the owners of the fishing vessels.   (Paragraphs 44-67.)(2) Sale of Fish on Commission in Wholesale Markets.That Parliament should be asked to approve legislation imposing restrictions in regard to the sale of fish on commission in wholesale markets, on lines similar to those in force in the central food markets of Paris.   (Paragraphs 82-90.)(3) Imports of White Fish.That the question of imposing restrictions on the imports of white fish, which amount to the substantial figure of  3,000,000, should be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in connection with any steps which may be taken with a view to improving the balance of trade.   (Paragraphs 121-124.)(-1) Exports of Dried Fish.That the English and Scottish Fishery Departments should confer with the Department of Overseas Trade on the question of initiating special inquiries with a view to taking advantage of the large potential markets for dried fish and fish meal for human consumption in Africa and the East.   (Paragraph 127.)(5) Need for Further Information on the Marketing of White Fish.That as soon as financial conditions permit, a systematic marketing inquiry should be undertaken on the lines suggested by the English and Scottish Fisheries Departments.   (Paragraphs 130-134.)(6) Surveying of New Fishing Grounds.That the survey of new fishing grounds by H.M.S. &quot; Challenger,&quot; now temporarily postponed on account of financial conditions, should be put in hand as soon as these become somewhat easier and without waiting until there is an actual shortage of white fish. (Paragraphs 142-148.)II. HERRINGS AND DRIFTING.-(7) The Disposal of the Surplus of Pickled Herrings for Export.That Parliament should be asked to provide for the establishment of a Board representing registered producers, i.e., curers and exporters, empowered: (a) To regulate the periods during which herrings may be pickledin Great Britain or in any part of Great Britain in such a way that different periods hold good for different parts of the country, and to prohibit the export of British herrings pickled outside the period prescribed by the Board.(b) To impose penalties on any registered producer contraveningsuch regulations.(c) To provide for the advertisement of pickled herrings abroad.(d) To conduct investigations into the trend of foreign markets.(e) To promote research.(f) To levy contributions at a fixed rate upon all registered producers for the purpose of meeting the expenses involved in the discharge of the foregoing funotions and in the general course of administration.   (Paragraphs 214-220.)(Note.- Possible extensions of the functions of the above Board are discussed in paragraph 219.)
III.-THE INSHORE FISHERIES.(8) Amendment of the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888.That Parliament should be invited to amend the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, by giving power to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to revoke or modify existing by-laws made under that Act, and also to initiate such new by-laws as he may from time to time consider necessary.   (Paragraphs 245-249.)(9) Salmon Fisheries:  Need of Additional Powers of Regulation in Scotland.That Parliament should be invited to confer upon the Fishery Board for Scotland powers substantially similar to those already possessed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act, 1923, and previous legislation consolidated in that Measure, such powers to include : (a) The general supervision of district Boards, with Power to take action when the appropriate district Board fails to do so.(b) The Collection of statistics.(c) Power to initiate and direct local inquiries.(d) Power to conduct scientific investigations.(e) Power to give or withhold approval to plans of fish passes.before construction.(f) Power to deal with pollution.(g) Power to make by-laws.(Paragraphs 255-260.)(10) Purification of Mussels and Cockles.(a) That Parliament should be invited to confer powers upon sanitary authorities and County Councils either to provide tanks and other apparatus for the purpose of cleansing and sterilising shellfish or to contribute on agreed terms to the provision of such apparatus by some other authority or person.(b) That, having regard to the somewhat different conditions in Scotland, the Fishery Board for Scotland should consider whether similar legislation is desirable for that country.   (Paragraphs 269-280.)(11) Imports of Mussels.(a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should invite Parliament to pass legislation prohibiting the importation of mussels from foreign countries, except in cases where they are subjected to an approved cleansing process after their arrival in this country.(b) That at the same time arrangements should be made with the Irish Free State which will ensure the quality of the mussels imported from that country.   (Paragraph 281.)(1&apos;2) Purification of Oysters.That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Fishery Board for Scotland should consider the practicability of including in the legislation referred to in Recommendation (10) and (11) above for the purification of shell-fish provisions enabling them to prescribe the cleansing both of native oysters and of oysters imported from abroad.   (Paragraph 282.)(13) The Marketing Difficulties of the Inshore Fishermen and the Need for Co-operation. That, with a view to fostering co-operation among the inshore fishermen, arrangements should be made for the closest co-operation between the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and&quot; Fisheries and the Fisheries Organisation Society, and, in particular, for the association of the Departments district fishery officers with the work of that Society.   (Paragraphs 295-302.)
IllIY__HARBOURS.&apos;(14) Survey of Inshore Fishery Harbours.That a general survey of fishery harbours should be undertaken forthwith by the Development Commission in consultation with the English and Scottish Fisheries Departments, the survey to embrace consideration not only of the engineering and other technical problems involved, but also wider questions relating to the economic position of the fishermen.   (Paragraphs 317-322.)(15) Need for Additional Regulating Powers in Scotland.(a) That Parliament should be invited to enact legislation facilitating the acquisition of small fishery harbours by local authorities.(b) That the legislation referred to in (a) above should include the provision of a simple method by which harbour authorities may obtain powers to undertake works, and by which existing harbour provisional orders may be amended on such matters as the alteration of schedules of dues.

* Note of Reservation by Mr. Charles Duncan, M.P.I have signed the Report subject to the following reservations : Paragraph 47 (page 12) in which no reference is made to a manning scale, which in my judgment requires legislative attention.Paragraph 77 (page 18) and paragraph 888 (11) (page 93)-I desire to associate myself with the note at the foot of page 18-by Captain Basil Hall.Paragraph 124 (page 29) and paragraph 384 (3) (page 109)-I am opposed to the recommendation in this paragraph as it would create a monopoly, and fish would speedily increase in price beyond the reach of the poorer people.(Signed)      CHARLES DUNCANf Note of Reservation by Mr. Robert Murray.I .am in complete agreement with my colleagues on all points in this Report, witli the exception of the references to the Firth of Clyde in paragraphs 381 and 382.The views therein expressed seem to me entirely inconsistent with our recommendations regarding the Moray Firth. In the latter case we are unanimous in agreeing that efforts should be made to have the Firth closed by international agreement to foreign trawlers, failing which, that the status quo should be maintained, i.e., that British trawlers should continue to be excluded as their admission would only intensify the evils for which a remedy is sought. In the case of the Firth of Clyde, however, it is stated (paragraph 381) (1) that the grounds for excluding foreign trawlers are much stronger; and(2) that the objections are much weaker.Actually, the objections are, if possible, stronger than in the Moray Firth. The Clyde area is and always has been principally a herring-catching area and the local fishermen have always manifested the strongest opposition to unrestricted trawling therein, on the ground that thereby &quot; their herring fishing would be ruined &quot; (para-graph 380).I consider therefore that there are adequate reasons (1) for maintaining the status quo in the closure of the Firth of Clyde to British trawlers, and (2) the extension of this to foreign trawlers if such extension should be found possible. The Committee had no evidence to support the opinion expressed in paragraph 882 that &quot;the meivs fears on this subject are largely misconceived.&quot; Notwithstanding the absence of such evidence, however, the men&apos;s fears may be exaggerated and I agree with the suggestion &quot; that the Scottish Fishery Board should discuss the whole question afresh with these men with the object of dispelling their apprehensions on this ground.&quot;
Failing agreement, however, I am entirely opposed to the proposal that the Departments should consider whether a by-law throwing the Clyde open to all trawlers &apos;&apos; should be made notwithstanding this opposition&quot; (of the local fishermen).In my view the only alternative courses which can be con-sidered are (1) an effort to exclude all trawlers from the Firth of Clyde by international agreement if this is necessary, (2) the reasoned removal of the fishermen&apos;s objections to the admission of British trawlers, and (3) (failing the attainment of either 1 or 2) the maintenance of the status quo.(Signed)      ROBERT MURRAY.

APPENDIX III.The Administration and Regulation of the Public Markets of Paris with Special Reference to the Sale of Fish.(Memorandum by the Fisheries Department, Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries.)A system of control was instituted for the Central Markets of Paris* by a law of the 11th June, 1896, which was made in consequence of complaints by consignors of commodities to the Market against the salesmen who handled their goods. By this law, and regulations made under it, salesmen in the Market are restricted to acting as commission agents for the consignors. They are forbidden to purchase on their own account commodities sent to them for sale or any similar commodities, or to trade in such commodities either personally or by agents, even outside the Markets, or to own any shop or store in Paris or in the Provinces. Any person contravening these regulations is subject to dismissal.Salesmen may be remunerated only by commission agreed between them-selves and their principals.The control of the Market is in the hands of a special Commissioner of Market Police and an Inspectorate working under him. The Police Authorities are responsible for the apportionment of stands according to the requirements of each agent; these requirements are judged by the volume of business done during the previous three years.A Disciplinary Committee for the Market was instituted in 1929 with power to inflict penalties (warning, suspension for a period not exceeding one month and expulsion) in the event of infringement of the regulations.In addition to these penalties Commission agents may be indicted before the Criminal Courts for certain offences, and are liable on conviction to imprisonment for periods ranging from two months to two years, and to fines of not less than 25 francs.The Disciplinary Committee consists of six senior officials of the Market and police services with three representatives of the Commission agents. The posts of President, Vice-Prcsident and Secretary are all held by the official members. The Committee is summoned to meet by the President who, after hearing the ease, transmits the recommendations of the Committee to the Prefect of Police who either takes action himself or refers the matter to the Prefect of the Department of the Seine.Only persons who are registered on a list published by the Tribunal of Commerce are permitted to act as Commission agents in the Markets. Such registration is accorded only to persons of French nationality in full possession of civic rights.Candidates for appointment as Commission agents must pass an examination partly theoretical and partly practical. The theoretical examination includes the general principles of commercial law, book-keeping, banking and bank-ruptcy. The practical test comprises the recognition of different species of fish, appreciation of quality and freshness, and hygiene of handling. Candidates are required to have had five yes-rs&apos; experience of handling the commodity in which they propose to deal.On registration, Commission agents have to deposit with the Market Authorities a sum of not less than 5,000 francs, from which may be deducted in the course of a year any fines incurred or any charges imposed by the Market Authorities.The list of Commission agents is revised every five years by the Tribunal -of Commerce with the collaboration of the police authorities.Commission agents are bound to keep proper books of account, which must be retained for three years and be available for inspection at any time in the event of complaints being made with regard to prices or weight of consign-ments, amounts deducted for expenses and commission, or other matters arising out of the handling of consignments entrusted to them. A counterfoil duplicate book must show full particulars of the receipt, sale and price realised by the sale of each consignment. The duplicate, which must be sent to the -consignor, must set forth in detail the authorised expenses (cost of transport, local duties,! handling and storage, supported by vouchers checked by the Market Authorities) and the inclusive commission charge. Where several -consignments are received from one source these details may be set out in a list, instead of on separate sheets for each consignment.The amount of commission which an agent may charge is a matter of arrangement between him and his principal, but ho must not depart from the -agreement which has been made. Expenses must be charged according to an official schedule. The agent must send to his principal the sum (less authorized deductions) realised by the sale of goods with the particulars mentioned not later than the day following the sale, unless special arran^e-ments to the contrary have been made between the parties.Any credit which a Commission agent may give to a- purchaser is purely the agenfs concern.   He must not, on account of such credit, make any* The Public Markets are for the wholesale marketing of foodstuffs bv fuu-uui! ul pwvatc treaty, t Octroi.
deduction from the sum realized by the sale or delay remitting such amount to his principal. Material errors must be notified within 24 hours. The services of the Market Authorities may be utilised for examination of any -complaints of improper sale or incorrect remittances for goods.The agent is responsible for goods which are entrusted to him. He must be present throughout the sales, unless he has, with the sanction of the Market Authorities, arranged for a deputy to attend on his behalf. In emergencies the Market Authorities will appoint a deputy and fix his honorarium. Subject to the instructions of the consignors, sales may be by auction or by private treaty.Goods must not be removed from the Market unless sold or declared unfit for consumption.If, for any valid reason, goods are not sold at the termination of the day&apos;s business, the Market Authorities have the power to place them in cold storage. :Such goods will be sold at the opening of the Market on the following day, after having been passed by the sanitary inspectors as fit for human consumption.Goods which are found on arrival or removal from cold store to be unsound are condemned and a certificate of condemnation is given to the Commission agent.Selling can only take place between certain definite hours which are fixed for the opening and closing of the Market. Unauthorised persons may only enter the Market when selling is taking place. They may not remain longer than one quarter of an hour after the termination of business.Only authorised porters may handle commodities.The minimum size for &quot; lots &quot; is 3 kilogrammes for most commodities. Special minima have been fixed for certain kinds of fish, viz. : prawns, mussels, sprats, cockles, pickled herrings, oysters, herring and cod fillets.After the close of the sales, a statement showing the ranges of market prices for each species of commodity, taking into account their origin, is posted daily by the principal police officer on a notice board in the Market. The figures are determined in each section of the Market by a Committee composed of the -Chief Inspector and three Commission agents nominated by their colleagues. The list gives the maximum, minimum and average prices. No other prices may be used by Commission agents in their dealings with their principals under penalty of disciplinary action.
