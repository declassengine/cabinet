DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1932.SECRET. Copy No.        9CP. 11 (32).CABINET.CONVENTION TO IMPROVE THE MEANS OF PREVENTING WAR(CP. 319 (31)).Further Note- by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WHEN this matter came before the Cabinet on the 16th December it was decided to postpone a decision until the Chiefs of Staff had had the opportunity of considering the paper which I had circulated on the previous day (CP. 319 (31)). A further memorandum has been prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CP. 2 (32)) and the Admiralty and Air Ministry have also expressed their views. I have had the advantage of further consultation, in the light of these papers, with Lord Plailsham, Mr. Thomas, Admiral Dreyer and Sir John Salmond, and the Lord Chancellor was good enough also to attend and give us his opinion. .As a result we do not feel able, in present circumstances., to advise the Cabinet that the Draft Convention should be signed by this country. We think that the proper course is to take no step in this direction before the outcome of the Disarmament Conference is known.J. S.Foreign Office, January 6, 1932.6122a   [6405]
