REPORT.I.-INTRODUCTORY.1. AT their Meeting on 11th December, 1931 (Cabinet 88 (31), Conclusion 4), the Cabinet had under consideration the Prime Minister&apos;s most secret Memorandum (CP. 311 (31), paragraphs 4 (c) and 6) and agreed (a) A s regards the Balance of Trade that the following arrangements shouldbe made for obtaining the facts with the least possible delay: (i) The information contained in the First Report of the Committee on Economic Information of the Economic Advisory Council (CP. 271 (31)) should be brought up to date.(ii) The Board of Trade should prepare a Memorandum embodying the very latest figures and opinions as to how we stand in the matter, and as to the direction of movements. The Treasury should communicate to the Board of Trade any information they may have or may be able to obtain which bears on this subject: for example, as to movements of capital affecting the balance of payments.(b) That the above information should be circulated as soon as possible to aCabinet Committee, composed as follows The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair), The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, The Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Minister of Health, The President of the Board of Trade, The Lord Privy Seal,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,who should report to the Cabinet on the subjects arising out of the Memoranda, making such comments as they might think fit for the guidance of the Cabinet.In the event of an adverse balance of trade being disclosed, the Cabinet Committee were asked to advise what remedies were available and what would be the consequences in each case of their adoption.2. We have held five meetings, and have had under consideration memoranda bringing up to date the information regarding the balance of inter-national payments set out in the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council (referred to in paragraph 1 above); examining the capital items in the balance sheet; analysing British imports from gold standard and other countries; describing the course of exports and of employment in the safe-guarded industries; and containing proposals for rectifying the present adverse trade balance of this country.3. We addressed ourselves first to the question of the capital items in the balance of international payments. No reliable information is available regarding these items. Some, such as those of new issues on foreign account, are readily available, but others of equal importance, e.g., purchases and sales of foreign securities by British subjects and of British securities by foreigners are quite unknown. Efforts are made by the United States Department of Commerce to compile such figures for the United States, but it is doubtful how far the results obtained are reliable. As regards this country, we doubt whether any figures that could be obtained would give a reliable picture showing how the net balance of external investment is made up.
4. It is often argued that there is no problem of the balance of trade so long as the   is free to move, as, if the. balance is adverse, sterling will automatically fall to the point necessary to maintain equilibrium. This reason-ing, though sound, does not provide a guide to present difficulties unless, which is certainly&quot;not the case, we are prepared to accept any value of the   that the free play of economic forces may produce. The real problem is, therefore, to secure such a balance of payments as is consistent with a reasonable exchange value of the  . In a long period, the existence of a favourable balance of trade is one of the main factors tending to create confidence in us abroad. We conclude, there-fore, that for the purpose of our present inquiry, we may ignore capital move-ments, though owing to the severe and rapid effect which they may have on our exchange a close and continuous watch should be kept upon them.II.-THE BALANCE OF TRADE AND THE EXTENT OF POSSIBLEIMPROVEMENT.(a) The Estimate of the Committee on Economic Information of the Economic Advisory Council.5. In their Report submitted in September 1931, the Committee on Economic Information of the Economic Advisory Council set out the position as regards the balance of payments in recent years as follows : Table 1.Estimated Balance of Income and Expenditure in the Transactions (other than the Lending and Repayment of Capital) between the United Kingdom and all other Countries, 1930 and 1931.(In million  &apos;s.)	1 q^o	January-June,	Julv-December,	Jan uary-Decem b e r,		1931.	1931.	1931.Excess of imports over exports of				merchandise	386	183	203	386Estimated excess of Government				receipts from overseas	21	10	5	15Estimated net national shipping&apos;				income	105	44	41	85Estimated net income from over-				seas investments	210-230	90-100	55-75	145-175Estimated net receipts from short	-			interest and commissions	55	18		30Estimated net receipts from other				sources	15	5	5	10Total        ...          ..	-106-426	167-177	118-138	285-315Estimated total credit  or debit				balance on items specified above	4-1 20 to -f 40	- 6 to - 16	- 65 to - 85	- 71 to - 1016. The Committee on Economic Information considered that after making all allowances, the net debit against this country was then running at a rate of not less than  2 millions a week.(b) Probable Receipts in 1932 in. respect of Invisible Exports.7. As regards invisible exports, we see no reason to differ from their estimates for 1931. The Committee estimated the excess of imports over exports of merchandise for 1931 at the 1930 figure, i.e.,  386 millions. Actually the excess of imports over exports exceeded the Committee&apos;s estimate by  20 millions. Thus, ignoring the movements of gold on the one hand and capital items on the other, the favourable balance of trade which in 1929 amounted to  100 millions and in 1930 to  30 millions, had become in 1931 an adverse balance of between  90 and  120 millions.8. Turning to 1932, the most serious item is that in respect of net income from overseas investments, which may he anticipated to decline still further.   If
the hope of recovery in the export trade mentioned later in our Report is realised, some improvement may be anticipated in respect of the net national shipping income. On balance, we conclude that there is no prospect of the income derived from invisible exports exceeding in 1932 that estimated in 1931, viz., about  300 millions.(c) Exports of Merchandise.9. In considering the position as regards the exports and imports of merchandise in 1931, we have thought it convenient in the first place to use for comparison the figures for the twelve months ended the 30th September last, as during that period the decision of the 20th September to abandon the gold standard can have had little or no effect on the totals to be considered.10. Exports in the twelve months ended September last were valued at  422 millions as compared with  729 millions in 1929. The difference between these figures is due partly to a reduction in the volume of exports and partly to the severe fall in prices. In order to keep distinct the influences operating on these two factors, we consider below what the figures would have been in 1931 as compared with 1929 if the differences between the price-level of the two periods had been eliminated.Table 2.Exports Valued at the Prices of July-September 1931,Twelve MonthsEood, drink and tobaccoRaw   materials   and   articles   mainlyunmanufactured ...Articles wholly or mainly manufactured Other articlesTotalCalendar Year 1929.  million.5167 476 20614ended September 1931.   million.3948 299 1640211. By how much it may be found possible to expand exports during this year, having regard to the effect of the Exchange in facilitating competition with the products of countries still operating under the gold standard, must be largely a matter of conjecture. We deal later with possible means of expanding exports. That expansion will undoubtedly present great difficulties, but the calculations which follow are based on the assumption that it may be possible for the quantities of exports in the aggregate to expand in 1932 to the extent of one-half of the difference between the exports of the year 1929 and those of the twelve months ended September 1931.(d) Imports (Net) of Merchandise;12. Retained imports in the twelve months ended September last were valued at  814 millions, as compared with  1,111 millions in 1929. After making the same adjustment on account of changes in the price-level, as we have made in Table 2 above in respect of exports, we find that the value and character of the imports into this country, deducting re-exports in both periods, are as follows :  Table 3.Net Imports Valued at the Prices of July-September 1931.Calendar Year 1929.  million.351Food, drink and tobacco Raw  materials   and   articles   mainlyunmanufactured ... ...      193Articles wholly or mainly manufactured 230 Other articles        ... ... ...        11Twelve months ended September 193*1.  million.377160 227 10Total785774
13. It will be seen from the above table that, since 1929, there has been am increase in net imports amounting to about 7 per cent, in &quot;Food, drink and tobacco.&quot; If alcoholic liquors and tobacco are excluded, the increase in imports of food-stuffs amounts to 8-1 per cent. Provided there is no falling off of supplies from home sources, it may perhaps be assumed that no hardship would follow a reduction in the volume of imports of this class to the 1929 figure. At the July-September 1931 price-level this would secure a reduction in payments on this account of  26 millions.14. At the July-September 1931 price-level, the net imports retained of articles wholly or mainly manufactured were practically the same in 1931 as in 1929. Their declared value in the twelve months ended September 1931 amounted to  243 millions. Of this, about  60 millions represented imports of goods which could not be replaced, even in part, in this country. The balance, representing non-essentials and goods replaceable by British industry, is thus a little over  180 millions, of which about  26 millions were subject to duties on importation before the imposition of the duties under the Abnormal Importations legislation. The Board of Trade estimate that it might be possible to secure a reduction in this portion of the imports of manufactured articles by about one-third, without giving too much immediate shock to the trade of this country. This is equivalent to a reduction of about one-fourth of the aggregate net imports of this class. At the July-September 1931 price-level, this would secure a reduction in the value of imports of such articles from  227 to  170 millions.After making adjustments of the amounts described above, we estimate that the total value of net imports in 1932 at the price-level of the quarter July-September 1931 would be as follows : Table 4.* --Estimated net Imports in 1932 valued at the Prices of Jidy-Sept ember 1931.Twelve Months to September, l&apos;J31.377Estimate for 1932.351Food, drink and tobacco Raw  materials   and   articles   mainlyunmanufactured ... ...      160Articles wholly or mainly manufactured 227 Other articles       .... ... ...        10Total       ... ... ...      77415. Since 1929 the net imports of raw materials have declined by about 17 per cent. On the assumption made in paragraph 11 above, that one-half of the export trade lost since 1929 might possibly be recovered in 1932, it would be necessary to anticipate that the imports of raw materials in this year would be increased by about 10 per cent. This would mean an increase of about  16 millions at the price-level of July-September 1931. A further increase in the imports of raw materials would be required if goods hitherto habitually imported were replaced by British industry. If it were possible to reduce the imports (measured by value) of articles wholly or mainly manufactured by  60 millions, imports of raw materials to the value of about  15 millions would be necessary to provide for their replacement. On these assumptions, the net increase in imports of raw materials would amount to  31 millions.(e) Summary of Preceding Estimates.16. The assumptions involved in the estimates given in the preceding paragraphs for the possible reduction in the volume of imports and expansion of exports in 1932 may be summarised as follows : (a) That the quantity of retained imports of &quot; Food, Drink and Tobacco &quot; is reduced to that of 1929, a reduction of about 7 per cent.(b) That the quantity of retained imports of &quot; Articles wholly or mainlymanufactured &quot; is reduced by one-quarter, and replaced, so far as they are replaced, by manufacture in the United Kingdom.
(c) That the quantities of exports are increased to the extent, in the aggre-gate, of one-half the difference between the exports of the year 1929 and those of the twelve months ended September 1931.(d) That additional raw materials sufficient to meet the requirements arisingfrom assumptions (&amp;) and (c) are imported.17. On the foregoing estimates and on the assumption that the prices were those prevailing during the third quarter of 1931, we obtain the following estimate of imports retained and exports (United Kingdom produce) for 1932, as compared with 1931 :-Table 5.Estimate of Imports retained and Exports for 1932.

In the preceding argument, no account has been taken of the effect of the depreciated exchange on the cost of imports, and therefore on the balance of trade. The material available is as yet insufficient to provide a secure foundation for a definite conclusion. The Board of Trade estimate, however, that if in 1932 sterling import prices were on the average to rise 10 per cent, above those ruling in the period July-September 1931, the excess of imports in 1932 (estimated in Table 5 above at  214 millions), would, other things being equal, be raised to  286 millions. On the same basis, an increase of 15 per cent, would raise that figure to  322 millions.Up to the present, the records of our import trade have shown no upward tendency in the average values assigned to the goods imported and the extent of the effect of the continued depreciation of sterling on average import prices cannot be measured with any confidence. Having regard to the optimistic assumption we have used in our calculations of export trade expansion, we are of opinion that any restriction of imports that may be caused by &apos;&apos; sterling depreciation &apos;&apos; should be regarded as off-setting the probable failure to realise to the full the estimated expansion of exports.At present wholesale sterling prices appear to be rather less, on the average, than 10 per cent, above sterling (gold) prices immediately before the gold standard was suspended. As against these increases, some allowance should, however, be made for the increased sterling prices of British exports resulting from the depreciated exchange. For the foregoing reasons, we think it safer to ignore this consideration and to assume that there will be a 10 per cent, increase in the cost of imports. We therefore allow for an additional  7z mfliiohs on^this account. &quot;     1
w u 11/19. In the light of the whole of the assumptions contained in the preceding paragraphs, we therefore estimate the excess of imports over exports of merchandise in 1932 as follows :  Table 6.Estimated Excess of Imports over Exports in 1932.  million.Estimated value of imports retained (valued at theprices of July-September, 1931)      ... ... 722Estimated  increase  in  payments on account of10 per cent, increase in cost of imports ... 72 &quot;Estimated total value of imports           ... ... 794Estimated value of exports      ...         ... ... 508Excess of imports over exports ...          ... ... 28620. The foregoing estimate of the excess in 1932 of imports over exports, viz.,  286 millions, is, as will be seen from paragraph 8 above, in the neighbour-hood of the,, estimated receipts in that year in respect of invisible exports. If, therefore, the reduction in imports ( 52 millions) and the increase in exports ( 106 millions) contemplated in the preceding paragraphs could be achieved, the adverse balance of trade would be reduced to unimportant and we should come out more or -less on an even keel for the year. We think that this should be our objective and we propose now to examine possible methods of securing this end.III.-MEANS OF  INCREASING EXPORTS.21. In the preceding Section, we have assumed that it might be possible to increase the quantities of exports to the extent, in the aggregate, of one-half of the difference between exports of the year 1929 and those of the twelve months ended September, 1931. At the price-level of the third quarter of that year, this would involve an increase in exports of  106 millions. Unfortunately, it is far more difficult for Governments to increase the volume of exports than to restrict the volume of imports. There are, however, certain factors which are likely to promote some expansion in exports. Of these, by far the most important is the depreciation of the   which, so long as sterling costs of production remain unchanged, is equivalent to a corresponding advantage in favour of the export trade. The first effect of depreciation is to reduce the gold prices at which exports are sold. Thus, until the volume of our exports is increased propor-tionately, the net effect is to reduce their aggregate gold value. It is reasonable, therefore, to anticipate that some time must elapse before the balance of payments in respect of imports and exports is materially improved by the depreciation of the  . Further, a factor of uncertainty is introduced by the instability of the exchange and this has probably tended to delay the increase in the volume of exports. For these reasons, we conclude that full advantage of the depreciation of sterling has not yet been reaped by British manufacturers and that in the course of the year some increase in exports may be hoped for on this account.22. Another factor working towards an increase in exports may be found in the reduction of costs following an increase in output; of existing factories as the result of the imposition of a revenue tariff Again, it may be anticipated that a further reduction in costs of production may result after a time from the reorganisation and rationalisation of industry consequent upon the measures calculated to stimulate those processes referred to in a later part of our Report. This should help the export trade as and when it occurs, but it is unlikely that the process would have made such progress in the course of 1932 as to have much significance in connection with that year&apos;s exports.23. If, as we hope, it is found possible to secure by negotiation a reduction in the tariffs imposed by foreign^cpjintries and the^Dormnioiis on our manufac-tures, a further increase may&quot;be anUcipalell&quot;nr^ucceedihg years iii the export of
sthe goods affected. In this connection consideration is being given to the possible efficacy of an Imports (Foreign Discrimination) Act as a check upon discrimina-tion by any foreign countries against our export trade.24. The foregoing factors taken together may result in a substantial increase in exports, but, having regard to the present international outlook, we are not justified in concluding that the whole of the desired increase of  106 millions could be achieved this year by these means. If, however, there were any early improvement in the world situation, resulting from the cancellation of reparations and war debts, an important expansion of exports might be expected. Any steps, therefore, that the Government can take to contribute towards the improvement of the world situation would directly benefit our export trade.IY. MEANS OF REDUCING IMPORTS.25. In the preceding Section, we have discussed possible ways of securing an increase in exports; we now turn to the other aspect of our policy, namely, the reduction of retained imports by  52 millions.26. We have examined various possible methods of reaching this objective and have come to the conclusion that the best method would be a combination of a flat rate tariff with selective surtaxes on non-essential articles.(a) Prohibition of Imports.27. If we were prepared to view the matter solely from the standpoint of reducing imports, and to disregard entirely all other considerations, our object might be attained by the adoption of measures designed to secure the total prohibition of imports in selected cases, as, for example, prohibition of entry, or what in practice would amount to the same thing, the imposition of very high rates of duty.28. It may be argued that the adoption of such a course would be preferable to the imposition of a flat rate tariff on a wide range of articles, because it would neither prejudice manufacturers for export, nor raise the cost of living. Apart from Treaty difficulties, prohibition of import raises, however, very difficult questions and involves disturbance of trade and complications with particular foreign countries whose exports would be affected. It would be impossible to base a permanent policy on the grounds of forestalling, which justified emergency measures such as the Abnormal Importations legislation. Such a course would, moreover, be open to the following further grave difficulty. Even if all luxury imports, using the expression in a wide sense, were totally excluded, the saving that would result would not exceed  13 millions per annum.* In order to attain the desired reduction of imports by  52 millions, it would, therefore, be necessary to exclude imported commodities of the non-luxury categories to the extent of a further  39 millions. There is no reason to suppose that there are articles or classes of articles of anything like this value the whole of which could be permanently excluded. For these reasons, we are satisfied that the exclusion by a prohibitory tariff of specific imports would not alone secure the end we have in view.(b) Flat Rate Tariff of (say) 10 per Cent.29. We have accordingly considered whether it would be possible to secure the bulk of the effect desired by a general, but relatively slight, reduction in the volume of imports over a wide range of commodities.30. This could be secured by a revenue tariff of 10 per cent, ad valorem upon all imports into this country, which are not already dutiable, subject to certain exceptions, these exceptions being generally on the lines of the commodities exempted from duty in the tariffs of European countries, such as Holland, which approach nearest to the Free Trade system. Possible variations in the schedule of articles to be excluded, and their effect on the balance of* Note. See Appendix I List A.   Non-dutiable articles which can be regarded as non-essential.
payments, are set out in Appendix II. After careful consideration, we recommend that staple foodstuffs wheat, meat (including bacon), animals for food, and (subject to possible revenue considerations) the principal raw materials, including cotton, wool, iron ore, should be exempted from the proposed duty. Tea is another item which it is proposed to exclude, as this is more effectively dealt with on a specific basis. We feel that further time would be required to compile a full list of articles to be excluded. If our general recommendations are adopted, details can be readily worked out by the Board of Trade in consultation with the Treasury and other Departments concerned.31. The question how to deal with the case of articles which are already dutiable presents some difficulty. To add the 10 per cent, to the existing duty would probably cause some hardship where that duty already stands at a high level. On the other hand, to substitute the 10 per cent, for, say, the 33^ per cent, now levied on imported motor cars would at once increase the volume of imports and would thus be out of harmony with our declared object. There are only two or three insignificant cases where the existing duties are not equivalent to at least 10 per cent. It is therefore proposed that the existing duties should remain as they are without alteration.32. We have considered whether it would be advisable to give any drawbacks in respect of the proposed 10 per cent, tariff. We are advised that the needs of the entrepot and re-export trade can be adequately met by an extension of the existing facilities for transhipment and warehousing in bond. Any general system of drawback would involve very great practical and administrative difficulty, and after careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to give any drawbacks save in very exceptional circumstances.33. The figures given in this Report are on the assumption of the grant to the Dominions of a preference or rebate of one-third of the 10 per cent, tariff, this being in accordance with the general practice, in recent years. We do not, however, in fact propose that this preference should automatically come into operation, though when the 10 per cent, tariff is made public, we suggest that some intimation should be given that the whole 10 per cent, would form the subject of discussions at the Ottawa Conference, and might be modified, or even suspended altogether, if an adequate return could be obtained, and that a provision enabling such modification or suspension to be put into effect by Order in Council would be included in the legislation imposing the tariff.34. We have not found it possible to deal with the case of India, as we have had no opportunity of obtaining the necessary information. Before the scheme takes its final form, it could be arranged, if thought desirable, for preferences to be given to Indian products on lines similar to those proposed for Dominion products.35. In the case of the Colonies and Dependencies, we propose that special arrangements should be made, including total exemption from duty of some imports therefrom in certain cases. Many of the Colonies are in such financial difficulties that the only alternative to the grant of such exemption would be the increase of the British Grant in Aid to Colonies already in receipt of such assistance, or the giving of grants to others which are at present self-supporting.36. The figures given us by the Board of Trade indicate that, if we excluded the principal foodstuffs and raw materials from the operation of the tariff, we might expect a reduction of  33 millions, whereas if these were included, the reduction would amount to  46 millions. For our purposes, and assuming that raw materials are dealt with as suggested in paragraph 30, we think it may be taken that  34 millions would represent the reduction of imports to be expected. This falls short by  18 millions of the reduction in imports of  52 millions at which we are aiming, and this difference must therefore be made up by further measures.[6461]c
(c) Selective Duties on Non-essential Commodities.37. We think that these further measures should take the form of selective duties on non-essential articles, i.e., articles which individuals can do without or which the nation can do without because it can produce them itself.38. To make out a list of such articles and to embody it in a schedule to a Bill would not only provoke interminable discussions in Parliament, but would also deprive the Government of a very powerful lever which could be used to bring about the reorganisation of industry where it has hitherto persistently hung fire. Moreover, experience of the Abnormal Importations Act has shown that it is almost impossible to avoid making some errors in devising a new policy of this kind. It is also very convenient to have means at hand to correct such errors as soon as their existence is demonstrated.39. We are therefore of opinion that the most practical plan would be to take power to impose within defined limits a surtax on non-essential articles as defined in paragraph 37. Here, again, the experience of the working of the Abnormal Importations Act has been useful in showing the difficulties to be surmounted. If the responsibility for the administration of more permanent provisions were to rest solely on the shoulders of a single Minister, in consulta-tion with the Treasury, the burden might prove well-nigh insupportable. We,, accordingly recommend that there should be set up for the purpose an independent Advisory Committee of three judicially-minded persons, and that it should be laid down that the articles upon which a surtax is to be levied and the rate of surtax should be decided on the recommendations of such a body. We are satisfied&quot;, however, that it should be necessary to reserve power to the Minister (a) to refuse to accept a recommendation, (b) to suspend or remove a surtax if he were satisfied that it was being improperly made use of to raise prices to the consumer, or (c) to vary the rate of surtax downwards in order to enable tariff reductions to be negotiated with other countries.40. There are certain advantages attaching to our proposal for selective surtaxes or duties on non-essential commodities to which we wish to draw the special attention of the Cabinet.41. In the first place, we are satisfied that the proposal to empower the Minister to attach conditions to his sanction for a duty will be a useful means of encouraging industrial reorganisation and rationalisation. It is, we believe, desirable, that there should be this method of applying pressure upon the bulk of the staple industries of the country to reorganise and this proposal constitutes the type of pressure which those who have hitherto failed to participate in reorganisation may appreciate and to which they may be expected to respond.42. We agree that it should be made clear in any announcement on the subject that the imposition of a selective surtax to enable reorganisation to take place does not imply that the industry concerned will be entitled to such protection indefinitely after reorganisation has been effected.43. Secondly, we think that the existence of this power to impose a surtax, if coupled with a 10 per cent, flat rate tariff, will be of assistance in future trade negotiations with foreign countries, in particular, in furthering the policy of a reduction of foreign tariffs the importance of which is emphasised earlier in this Eeport. From the point of view of convenience of negotiation with foreign countries, the point at which the datum line is placed is not of great importance. It follows, in our opinion, that the Minister should have power to lower a particular selective duty if for purposes of negotiation with foreign countries this is thought to be necessary or desirable. At the same time it will be appreciated that it will be difficult to reduce the protection afforded to one industry because a foreign country is ready to make tariff concessions in regard to the products of another.
44. Finally, we would emphasise the value of the proposal from the point of view of Empire trade. The surtax machinery will enable the United Kingdom to offer to the Dominions, in the case of imports to which it applies and in which the Dominions are interested, higher rates of preference than under the flat rate tariff in return, of course, for adequate tariff concessions by the Dominions on exports to them from the United Kingdom.(d) A Combination of a Flat Rate Tariff with Selective Duties.45. In the foregoing paragraphs of this section of our Report, we have shown that a reduction of retained imports by  52 millions cannot be secured by the prohibition of specific imports, that a flate rate tariff of 10 per cent., subject to certain exceptions, would diminish our total net imports on the 1931 figures by some  34 millions, and that the difference, viz.,  18 millions, between this and  52 millions could be met by the imposition of selective duties on non-essential articles.V.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.46.   Our report to the Cabinet may be summed up as follows :-(a) This country had a credit balance on income account (including bothvisible and invisible items) of about  100 millions in 1929 and of about  30 millions in 1930. In 1931 there was a debit balance of  90 to  120 millions. In the absence of remedial measures this large debit balance will probably be still further increased in 1932.(b) Our adverse balance is not caused by movements of capital.   Owing tothe severe and rapid effect which these may have on our exchange, a close and continuous watch should be kept upon them.(c) In 1931 a serious feature  was the  decrease  in the net receipts from invisible exports. These are unlikely to improve until there is an increase in international trade. No action by the Government can affect it except slowly and indirectly.(d) The most favourable assumptions which can be made for 1932 are asfollows: (i) That the quantity of retained imports of &quot; Food, Drink and Tobacco&quot; is reduced to that of 1929, a reduction of about 7 per cent.&apos; (ii) That the quantity or retained imports of &quot;Articles wholly or mainly manufactured&quot; is reduced by one-quarter, and replaced, so far as they are replaced, by manufacture in the United Kingdom.(iii) That the quantities of exports are increased to the extent, in theaggregate, of one-half the difference between the exports of the year 1929 and those of the twelve months ended September 1931.(iv) That additional raw materials sufficient to meet the require-ments arising from assumptions (ii) and (iii) are imported.[6461] c 2 .. -
(e) If these assumptions were fulfilled, the balance sheet of visible items for1932 would take the following form, as compared with that for the twelve months ended September 1931. (The values are expressed in terms of the prices prevailing from July to September 1931) :   million.Twelve Months Increase (4-)ended orSeptember 1931.   1932.        Decrease (-).Retained imports    ... 774 722 -  52Exports    of    UnitedKingdom produce... 402 508 4- 106Adverse visible balance 372 214 - 158(f) This estimated excess of imports will be further increased by a rise in sterling import prices, resulting from currency depreciation, which might be put at an average of 10 per cent, in the aggregate or  72 millions.(g) Upon this basis the total adverse visible balance for 1932 will be 286 millions. The favourable balance on invisible items is calculated at about the same figure, and we should therefore come out more or less on an even keel for the year. We recommend that this result be aimed at.(h) There will be great difficulty in achieving so large an increase of visibleexports as  106 millions in one year, although some advantage has been gained by the fall in our exchange. The means we recommend are: (i) Negotiations with foreign countries and the Dominions to secure a lowering of their tariffs on British manufactures.(ii) The reduction of our manufacturing costs by the acceleration of reorganisation in the production and marketing of our staple industries (see (m) below).(i) Apart from Treaty  difficulties, the reduction of our imports by 52 millions a year, by the exclusion of certain imports by a prohibitory tariff, is impracticable. Any attempt to do so would result in the undue disturbance of trade and would create embarrassing disputes with foreign countries, (j) A reduction of  34 millions could be obtained by a revenue tariff of 10 per cent, (if accompanied by an average preference of one-third of the duty to the Dominions and India and by free entry in certain cases for the Colonies and Dependencies) on all imports save those set out under paragraph 30 above. Save in exceptional circumstances no drawbacks would be granted, and existing duties, other than those under the Abnormal Importation Acts, would remain at present rates.(k) Of the commodities excluded the food-stuffs are exempted to avoid raising the cost of living to a point which would involve a rise in wages; the raw materials (if revenue considerations admit of their exclusion) in order not to handicap the expansion of our export trade. Further substantial exemptions would lessen the check to imports and would make further duties necessary under paragraph (I) below.
(1) A further reduction of imports of  18 millions would still be required, and this could be secured by imposing selective surtaxes on non-essential articles, i.e., articles which individuals can do without or which the nation can do without because it can produce them itself. The Minister responsible, on the advice of an independent Advisory Committee, should have power to bring the duties into operation by Order.(m) The Minister should have power to refuse or to attach conditions (e.g., reorganisation of an industry) to his approval of a duty and afterwards to suspend or remove a duty (e.g., if it were misused) or to lower it in return for tariff concessions from other countries. He should also have power to grant preferential reductions to the Dominions and India (in return for concessions to United Kingdom trade), and to grant reductions, or even exemption, to the Colonies and Dependencies without any such return.(n) The above measures would reduce our imports by  52^millions a year. If accompanied by an expansion of our export traoeby  106 millions, our adverse balance of payments would be rectified, if the invisible items remained as in 1931.(o) Immediate action is imperative. Our existing balance of trade implies a steady deficit on income account and a steady worsening of our capital position. In such circumstances our foreign exchanges could not long be maintained. We could, it is true, allow our volume of payments to be automatically adjusted by permitting our exchanges to fall indefinitely, but such a policy is unthinkable.47. We therefore recommend the following proposals to the Cabinet as a matter of urgent necessity : (1) A flat rate revenue tariff of 10 per cent &quot; ad valorem &quot; upon all imports into this country which are not already dutiable, with the exclusion of staple foodstuffs wheat and meat (including bacon and animals for food), tea and (subject to possible revenue considerations), the principal raw materials.(2) Selective surtaxes on non-essential articles, i.e., articles which individuals can do without, or which the nation can do without because it can produce them itself; these surtaxes to be imposed on the advice of an independent Advisory Committee, subject to the reservation of certain powers (cf. those set out in paragraph 46 (m) ) to the Minister in consultation with the Treasury.48. The Lord Privy Seal, who has certain general objections to the above proposals, and the Home Secretary who prefers certain alternative proposals, have undertaken to circulate their views in separate memoranda to the Cabinet direct, in order to save time. For these memoranda see CP. 31 (32) and CP. 32 (32) respectively.
Supplementary Recommendation in regard to Trade with Russia.49. We cannot close this Report without making a special reference to Russian trade. For many years Russian exports to this country have greatly exceeded her imports from us, and the credits obtained by Russian sales here have been largely used to buy from America, thus constituting a steady drain on the dollar exchange. In 1930 British exports to Russia were approximately  9^ millions, the bulk of which were sold on credit, while the imports from Russia tovhe United Kingdom were  34 millions, the whole of which were paid for in cash. During the same period, tEe United States exported to Russia  23^-millions, and imported from Russia only  5 millions. We accordingly suggest that the subject of trade with Russia should be considered in the light of its bearing upon the^adyerse balance of trade, and possibly the Cabinet may decide to refer the question tolin^onunittee.Signed on behalf of the Committee :N.

Appendix I.Non-Dutiable A articles which can be regarded as non-essential or which are, or can be, -produced in the United. Kingdom in Quantities Substantial in Relation to Consumption.THE appended lists comprise (A) Certain imported commodities not at present dutiable (except in some instances under the Abnormal Importations Act, which can be regarded as wholly non-essential : and(B) certain imported articles, wholly or mainly manufactured, not at presentdutiable, except in a number of cases under the Abnormal Importa-tions Act, which are or can be produced in the United Kingdom in quantities substantial in relation to consumption,together with the declared value of the retained imports (estimated in some cases) into the United Kingdom in 1931.The headings given are frequently of a very general kind, and detailed examination and practical experience would no doubt show that in a number of cases (e.g., machinery), they comprise commodities to which the above descrip-tions do not apply. It is impossible to estimate at all precisely the allowance to be made in that respect, but a deduction of 25 per cent, from list B would probably be a safe one, whilst the deduction from List A &quot;would probably be trivial. This would have the effect of reducing the total of the two lists, to which a duty higher than 10 per cent, ad valorem might be applied, from  118-8 millions to  90-8 millions. And as to this it must be remembered that it has been assumed in the previous estimates that the 10 per cent, duty on articles wholly or mainly manufactured would result in a reduction of imports by 10 per cent, in value; when allowance is made for this, the value of imports of articles wholly or mainly manufactured to which a higher duty might be applied, amounts approximately to  80 millions.It must be pointed out that a reduction in the importation of some of the commodities comprised in these lists (particularly in List B) would involve an increased importation of the materials necessary for their manufacture in this country, should the consumption of such commodities here be maintained, but the increase in the value of the materials imported would not be so large as to offset the decrease in the value of the manufactured articles imported.(A.)

They do not take account of the probable effects of the rise in average values of imports owing to the gold premium.
