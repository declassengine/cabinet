At their meeting on December 10th, 1931 (Cabinet 87 (31)Conclusion 6j the Cabinet agreed -&quot;That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(In the Chair) The Secretary of State for Scotland The First Commissioner of Works The Financial Secretary to the Treasury The Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Dominions Office, The Parliamentary Under-Secretory,Colonial Office, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Board of Trade -should be appointed for the purpose of assisting the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in the formulation of an Agricultural Policy&quot;.The Parliamentary&quot; Under-Secretary of Stnte for Scotlandand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries were subsequently added to the Committee.2. At their meeting on December 11th, 1931, (Cabinet 88 (31)Conclusion 6), after reference had been made to the question ofSmall Holdings and Allotments, and to the valuable work doneby the Society of Friends and the Winter Distress Society inassisting with the provision of tools and seeds, the cabinet agreed that these matters should be looked into by the CabinetCommittee on Agricultural Policy.3. At their meeting on December 14th, 1931 (Cabinet 89 (31)Conclusion 1), the Cabinet agreed that the Terms&quot;of Reference of the Committee should be extended to include the Fisheries industry. 4. Finally, at a meeting of the Cabinet on December 16th,1931 (Cabinet 92 (31) Conclusion 10), the Cabinet had before them a
(&apos;j &amp; cjMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War (CP. 323 (31/  ) on the subject of the supply to the Fighting Forces at home of home fed beef and of flour containing a percentage of English wheat.    The Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for War to send the Memorandum in question to the Committee for consideration.THS PRESENT AGRICULTURAL SITUATF)F, 5. The whole agricultural situation of this countryis reviewed in the Report of the Agricultural Policy Committee of the Economic Advisory Council, which was presented in July 1930 and was recently circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 279 (31)   ).6. That Report showed that agriculture over a long period has been gradually adjusting itself to the changing conditions in a competitive world, and that, in consequence, there has been a genera.l decline in the output of cereals and an increase in the production of livestock, dairy produce, poultry and eggs.    This change has only taken place under the pressure of economic necessity:    cereal growing is the branch of farming which has, except in boom periods been confronted with the greatest difficulty.    Prior to the present world-wide depression caused by the general fall in prices which began in the autumn of 1929, severe depression in agriculture, as in industry^ was confined to certain parts of the country and to some branches of agriculture, chiefly cereal growing;    agriculture like industry, had its black spots.7. At the present time, however, the whole of agriculture,like the whole of industry, is suffering from the catastrophic fall in prices which in the last two years has affected almost all   commodities.     The index figure for all
agricultural commodities has fallen from 143 in December ,1929, to 117 in December, 1931.    Practically the whole of agriculture Is faced with the difficulty that prices of commodities have fallen heavily Tfhilst most of the costs of production or overhead charges, such as wages, rents, mortgage payments, otc, have remained practically fixed.    The urgent nood of agriculture, therefore, is essentially the 3ame as the urgent need of industry, namely, to secure a general improvement in prices and wherever possible a reduction of co3ts*Home Production and Imported Supplies cf Pood, 80 To appreciate the problem of home agriculture it isimportant to realise not only the extent to which our people are dependent on importod supplies but also how this dependenoe varies with different commodities.   The latest relevant statistics which are available were published in 1929 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Pishories in its Report on &quot;The Agricultural Output and the Food Supplies of Great Britain&quot;* It mu3t be pointed out, however, that these figures spply for the most pert to the years 1924-7 and that 3ince then the consumption per head of the population has undergone some change, for example the quantity of butter end bacon consumed ha3 noticeably increased and the consumption of margarine has been reduced.    Moreover, values have also been considerably reducedo Severthe less, the following figures are of interest as indicating In broad outline the relative importance of the different commodities in the nation&apos;s dietary and the extent to which demands are met from home and imported supplies.   It should be noted that the values used for the purpose of calculating the figures given in the following table are mainly farmers&apos; prices in the case of home produce and declared values in the case of imported supplies.   These values are, therefore, not a guide to the expenditure of the consuming public *

9.   We have given careful consideration to the methods which can best be adopted for stimulating home production.   We deal with the subject of tariffs first as being appropriate for immediate action.   We attach great importance, however, to a long-range policy on economic development involving reorganisation and a reduction of waste.   Our Report is accordingly arranged, so far as it deals with agriculture, under two main heads concerned with short-range and long-range policy.   It will be observed that it is mainly under the latter head that we discuss (a) milk, (b) potatoes and (c) bacon, ham and lard, which commodities provide the most important field for developing home production.   It will be convenient to deal first with &quot;Short Range&quot;.SHORT RANGE POLICY..10. The Agricultural Policy Committee of the Economic Advisory Council, referred to in para. 5 above, after   stating that they could not recommend a policy which would place agriculture on a peculiar footing and extend to it State assistance which is denied to other depressed basic industries, stated, as their final conclusion:    &quot;We hold no less strongly that if exceptional measures, whether permanent or temporary, involving a departure from our traditional economic policy should be contemplated for the assistance of other industries, agriculture has at least as strong a claim as any other&quot;. We are in general agreement with this conclusion.11. Apart from the predominantly oereal growing areas, which require special measures of assistance (the quota has already been adopted in principle for home-grown wheat), we consider that any assistance at the present time designed for the immediate help of the agricultural producer should be distributed as fairly and evenly as is practicable.
 2..       We have given consideration to the question of tariffs on agricultural imports approaching it from two different point of view -(a) a general moderate revenue tariff (hereinafter referred to as a general tariff) over the whole field of agricultural imports, and(b) tariffs applied only to selected agricultural commodities.13.       We are unanimously of the opinion that the decision as to which of these two methods should be adopted is a matter of high.policy which can be decided only by the Cabinet itself and is clearly bound up with considerations of the balance of trade and tariff policy generally.  .14.       We,aretof opinion, that if there is to be a general tariff over a.wide field, the same principle as is adopted for imports generally should be applied in like manner to imported agricultural commodities.15,       We realise that it is undesirable that any action should be taken which would cause such a rise in the cost ofliving as would necessitate an increase of wages.     We are notin a position to say what is the highest rate of duty for ageneral tariff which could he imposed without having this result.      In view, however, of the present level of wholesale prices of agricultural products, we consider that a generaltariff of about 10/-. could be imposed so far as this aspect of the -natter is concerned.     A tariff of 10may not raisethe wholesale price of the products included by as much as 10$The effect on the cost of living index figure ofa general agricultural tariff would be difficult todisentangle from such effect as may ultimately be produced on the cost of living by the depreciation of the  .In itself the effect of a ID); tariff on the cost of livingought not to be very great, not more than 3 to   &amp;f (whichat the present level of cost of living might represent an addition of say 5 to 9 points).6.
** &amp;16.       Vie now proceed to discuss the other method mentioned in paragraph 12,  i.e. the adoption of a tariff on selected agricultural commodities.17.       The Ottawa Conference.     At their Meeting on December 16th, 1931 (Cabinet 92 (31) Conclusion 5), the Cabinet had before them the Second Report of the Cabinet Committee on the proposed Imperial Economic Conference at. Ottawa (CP. 324 (31)).     On the clear understanding that no Minister was committed in principle or in detail to a tax on foodstuffs of any kind, and that any decision on this subject was reserved until information was before the Cabinet as to what advantages to British trade the Dominions were prepared to offer, the Cabinet agreed to take note of the Report of the Ottawa Committee, and to invite that Committee to discuss the position with representatives of the Dominions and to report to the Cabinet their impressions as to the prospects of an arrangement with the Dominions.18.       In pursuance of this Conclusion, it is proposed that the discussion with the representatives of the Dominions should proceed on the assumptions that duties might be imposed on the following food products imported into this country, and that the tariff concessions to the Dominions in regard to these commodities may, in certain circumstances, take the form, not of free entry into the United Kingdom, but of a rate of duty more favourable than the rate charged on the products of airy foreign country:-Butter.Cheese. Hcnoy.Raw Apples. Raw Pears. Oranges. Grapes.Other raw fruit (grape fruit and possiblypeaches, nectarine and plums).Canned fruit preserved in sugar (includingcanned pineapple).
t$ -7) (** &apos;kt- toCanned salmon, crab, crayfish and lobster.Dried and preserved fruit.(Increase of general tariff on raisins, sultanas and dried apricots).19.   The Horticultural products (Emergency Customs Duties) Act empowers the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to impose by Order duties on the following fresh fruits, fresh vegetables and fresh flowers, etc:-FRESH FRUITS.Cherries Grapes (Hothouse)Currants PlumsGooseberries StrawberriesFRESH VEGETABLES.Asparagus LettuceGreen Beans MushroomsBroccoli and Cauliflowers Peas (Green) Carrots Potatoes (New)Chi o cry (Salad) T omatoe sC u:-.&apos; b e r s T ur a I p sEndiveFLOWERS, ETC.Cut flowers FoliagePlants in flower BulbsFlowers attached to Rose Treesbulbs20.   Duties have, in fact, been imposed by an Order which came into force on the 5th January, 1952, on all the above commodities with the exception of tomatoes and bulbs.   The making of an Order dealing with these two commodities is at present under consideration.21w   The Horticultural Products (Emergency Customs Duties) Act, however, is a temporary measure which remains in force for only a year.   We recommend that the Act afacoUd b-3 continued.
22.       It is obvious that, even if import duties are imposed on all the commodities mentioned in paragraph 18, and if theduties on the commodities in paragraph 19, are continuedindefinitely, the extent to which home agriculture is benefitedby these duties would be very much restricted.   We have,therefore, considered the whole range of imports of other agricultural produce and we make the following recommendations:-(a)   Commodities which should not be included in a selective tariff.(23)     Beef, Mutton and Lamb.(23)     Bacon, Hams and Lard.(24)     Tinned Skimmed Condensed Milk.23.     Beef. Mutton and Lamb;   Bacon, Hams and Lard.    Owing to the extent to which these commodities figure in the working-class budget we do not&quot; consider them suitable for inclusion in a selective tariff.24.     Tinned 3kimmed condensed milk.      There is hardly any commodity on which stronger views are expressed by agriculturists generally than on condensed, skimmed milk of which over three million pounds worth per annum is imported into this country.The law requires that the tin should be marked &quot;UNFIT FOR BABIES&quot; and there is a general impression amongst agriculturists that the milk has little or no food value;    consequently agriculturists have constantly pressed that the importation should be prohibited or that a prohibitive duty should be imposed. The milk is only unfit for babies because babies require milk which is a complete food in itself, and this milk is deficient*   The numbers in brackets refer to the paragraphs in this Report in which comment is made on the various commodities.
&amp; vj lnseeing that the butter-fat has been abstracted.   This milk contains all the solids of milk except butter-fat and it also contains a substantial proportion of sugar:   indeed It is quite a useful article of food in a mixed diet.   We understand that it is used chiefly by the poorer classes for mixing with tea. Moreover, it is a by-product of large-scale butter-making and could not be profitably produced in this country at present. In the circumstances we recommend that at any rate for the present tinned skimmed condensed milk should be allowed free entry.(b) Commodities which should be included in a selective tarifTl25.   The following list of commodities has been selectedprimarily from the point of view of their suitability for tarifftreatment designed to benefit agriculture.We consider that a selective tariff equivalent in aggregate amount to a 10% general tariff could be imposedso far as the effect on the cost of living Is concerned(see paragraph 15 above)*Seeing that the tariff is selective the rateof duty will obviously vary in each case.     These rates will have to be considered at a later stage.10.

26. Eggs.The imposition of a duty on imported eggs presents certain practical difficulties.     The large imports of very cheap eggs do not seriously compete with home-produced eggs. It would not, hovyever, be practicable to exempt these eggs from a duty.     If the duty were to be charged by weight (and still more by number), the effect of the duty would be felt most acutely by the purchasers of cheap imported eggs.     An ad valorem duty is impracticable.     A scheme, which, it is believed, will overcome these difficulties has been submitted to the Customs, and the result of their examination will be considered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Board of Trade. Subject to this scheme proving to be administratively practicable we recommend that og,T,s should be included in a selective tariff. 27. Fruit pulp and other fruit products.The imposition of duties on fresh fruit under the Horticultural Products Act will almost certainly have the effect of increasing the injury caused to home producers by the importation of fruit pulp canned and bottled fruit.     To the extent to which these duties restrict imports of fresh fruit, it may be anticipated that additional quantities will be canned or bottled or converted into fruit pulp on the Continent.     We consider, therefore, that the imposition of a duty on fruit pulp and canned and bottled fruit and possibly jam is a necessary corollary of the duties v/hich have recently be^n imposed on fresh fruit.     We recommend that duties on these commodities corresponding to those on fresh fruit should be imposed.We consider, however, that there is need for a comprehensive enquiry into the organisation of the fruit industry, and that special care should be taken to ensure that new industries such as the canning industry which is growing rapidly in importance should not be endangered.
*j; &apos;CyAt ii i28.     Oat products.A duty on imports 01 oat products from foreign countries would be very -popular in Scotland.    Total imports in 1930 were valued at  600,000.    About four-fifths of the imports came from Canada,    vie recommend oat products as a subject for &amp; selective tariff. 29*     Malting Barley.A tax on imported malting - barley presents very considered  -able difficulties, owing to the fact that it is impossible to distinguish ot the port between barley which might be used for malting and barley which might be used for animal feeding purposes, and agriculturists object strongly to a tariff on feeding barley without e corresponding duty on meat.      it may be possible eventually to afford assistance to barley growers by means of a quota system, but it is impossible to express an opinion on this until a quota scheme ha- been worked out in detail.    This is being examined.    In the meantime the only immediate action which can be taken is the imposition of a tariff.    It may be possible to solve the difficulty of a tariff by some system of treating duty-free bo.rley which will prevent its being used subsequently for malting.    ?ve recommend therefore,that the Cabinet should agree to the imposition of a Customs duty on maltinp; barley conditional on its being found by further investigation (1) that the cost of staining or kibbling imported barley not intended for maltiriK is not likely to increese unduly the price of feeding barleys in this country, and (2) that the process of staining or kibbling will be effective for the purpose..in view. 30.    Plants (certain nursery stock).The plants in question are mainly produced in Holland. Their importation into Germany and Prance is prohibited at the present time and consequently they are being imported into this country and
sold at prices much, below the cost of production here.    A3 a large proportion of these are of poor quality it is in the interests of smallholders and other United kingdom purchasers as well as the United Kingdom producers, that they should be subject to a substantial duty. 31.     Wheat meal and flour.imports in 1930 were valued at  6,600,000.   We make no specific recomuendation for a tr..riff on imported wheat meal and flour.    Any increase in the home supply of milling offals would be of considerable benefit to home agriculture, but this could only be accomplished by a reduction in the quantity of imported flour.    The question can be considered entirely apart from the quota scheme for home-grown wheat, and it will no doubt arise in connection with the scheme for a quota for Dominion wheat. 32.      Fresh liquid milk.The imports of fresh milk other than from the Irish Free State are usually negligible, hut during 1931 3,000 cwts. valued at  2,000 were imported.    V/e do not consider that there is much danger of the importation of appreciable quantities of fresh milk from the Continent at the present time, but it is possible that the trade may be developed in the future.    At any rate, there is no doubt that the importation this year has caused considerable resentment and alarm amongst dairy farmers, and a substantial duty on this import would give great satisfaction to agriculturists without doing injury to anyone.    We therefore recommend that a substantial duty-should be imposed on the importation of fresh liquid milk from foreign countries.
0&apos;j til c33. Condensed milk and milk powder, (other than skimmed mllk)*._____There seems to be no reason why the home production of condensed milk should not be increased if imports were restricted. We consider that sane restriction of imports is necessary before new capital can be attracted into this industry.   An expansion of the home industry would be very valuable to the home milk producer as the factories would then take more of the milk which is now surplus to the quantity required for consumption as liquid milk. We consider that the Government ,s Agricultural Policy should contain a comprehensive scheme for the re-organ!sation of the milk industry and for the reduction of disease amongst dairy cattle.   This matter is dealt with more fully in paragraphs 37-40.   The only immediately effective action which can be taken by the Government is the imposition of a tariff on imports, and we therefore recommend that cream and all kinds of condensod whole milk as well as milkpowder should be subject to a Customs duty.34. Long Range Policy..   The proposals ilav tariffs made in the foregoing paragraphsare suggested for immediate application.   We attach great Importance,however, as already stated, to a long range policy designed tofacilitate economic development and reorganisation in those branchesof the industry which in the long run are likely to be the mostremunerative.   We therefore consider that this matter should begiven a prominent place in the Government18 programme and that special mention should be made of two branches of agricultural policy in which there is much to be done, although the necessaryplans for action will take time to devise.   The first is animaldiseases research and action to reduce the incidence of disease;the second is marketing reform, particularly marketing re-organ!sationwhich we consider should form a necessary corollary of tariff concessions.   We attach great importance to marketing efficiency and we consider that it should be urged on the farmer on every possible occasion.   Improved organisation Is essential if homeagrioulture is to make its due contribution towards helping thecountry out of its present economic troubles.15.
35. The milk Industry,A comprehensive policy in regard to the milk industry - one of the most important branches of agriculture embraces both these subjectsj   indeed, we consider that a comprehensive policy for milk should be tripartite and should include (1) the restriction of imports, (2) the improvement of production by the reduction of waste due to disease, and (3) the reduction of the costs of marketing by re-organisation.   We have already recommended a tariff on imports of milk other than skimmed milk and a tariff on butter and cheese will be discussed in connection with the Ottawa Conference.   Various schemes for reducing bovine tuberculosis have been considered by the Agricultural Departments and we    recommend that an approved scheme should be put into operation at the earliest possible^e^da^e. ^This problem Is of great social importance^as^the elimination of bovine -tuberculosis would res,ult In a saving of child******life.     Moreover, the inc^^ased confidence of the public in the safety of mirlk would probably lead to an increaseof bovine tuberculosis Is of great social importance, since the elimination of tuberculosis from our dairy herds would diminish mortality among children, and would save many whoconstitutions.     It is also of great agricultural importance since (apart from the saving of the farmer&apos;s direct loss) the Increased confidence of the publio In the safety of milk should lead to a material increase in its consumption.problem of reducing the Incidencesurvive childhood from impaired health and weakened
36.     The whole subject of research into diseases of animals has been referred by the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries to the -iigrioultural Research Council, and wo are notSh^h a c ,in a position to make any/recommendation on diseases of dairy stock other than tuberculosis.37.     The question whether the necessary organisation of the milk industry should be under the Marketing Act or otherwise is a matter for further consideration.38.     Some members of the Committee consider that the imposition of duties under paragraphs 32 and 33 should be dependant on the adoption of the other two parts of the tripactite policy.39 *     We therefore recommend that in the Government announce-ment on agricultural policy a statement should be made that the Government intend to pursue a comprehensive policy in regard to milk involving tariffs on imported milk and milk products, the reduction of disease among dairy herds and the improvement, of the marketing of milk.40. Potatoes.     A Customs duty on new potatoes has alreadybeen imposed under the Horticultural Products Act.     We do not recommend that there should be tariff on imported main croppotatoes at the present time .     We consider that any control ofthe importation of potatoes should only be instituted as part ofa policy for organising the marketing of the home crop.     Wetherefore recommend that the Governments statement on agricul-tural policy therein should include^ an undertaking,to appoint are-or^anieation commission, if desired by potato growers, withmarketing of theinstructions to prepare a scheme for the organisation of the/home potato orop and to consider such complementary action consistent with treaty obligations as may appear to be necessary or desirable for the regulation of imports of main crop potatoes.
41. Bacon. Hams&apos; and Lard.Of all branches of agriculture, the pig industry offers perhaps the greatest possibilities of rapid expansion, and such development on a profitable basis would substantially benefit a large number of agriculturists, particularly small-holders.42.   During the period 1928-30, the annual factory output of bacon and hams in Great Britain is believed to have been about 2,000,000 cwts., whereas the Imports into Great Britain for the same period averaged nearly 9,800,000 cwts.    Imports from Denmark in 1931 were on an unprecedented scale, and although these heavy imports from Denmark are due to abnormal causes and are unlikely to be maintained, it must be remembered that bacon export industries are being developed assiduously In a number of northern European countries.43.     Even&apos;vIn normal times the strength of the competition of imports is such that there is no prospect of the organised development of the home Industry being successful if it is left to its own resources.   The expansion of pig production in this country must involve the invasion of the bacon market which is now in the hands of Continental suppliers.    Moreover, Denmark, by far the most important contributor to our supplies to-day, has no alternative market.   Her whole bacon organisation is designed with the single aim of supplying the British market with bacon of one type and quality.   In the event of an attempt to expand home output at the expense of Imports sheer economic necessity would compel Denmark to conduct a price war which, however costly to herself, would make it impossible to build up a new home industry.   Moreover, there Is a wide margin between the price of best Danish bacon and the average of first and second quality English bacon which during the years 1927-29 varied between 1/- and 36/- per cwt. in favour of the
home product.   This margin, at current prices is 18/-, which represents 35,* of the current value of first quality Danish bacon.44.    It is obvious that a Customs Duty, unless it were at a very high rate, would be ineffective as a stimulus to the organisation of the home industry.    It must be bomo in mind in this connection that bacon is an important article of food, particularly in the poorest households, and that although current prices are abnormally low a rise may be expected to occur in the near future in any circumstances quite apart from any artificial rise which might be caused by a tariff.    We have already stated that we do not recommend a selective tariff on imported bacon, hams and lard.    l7o consider that only by quantitative import regulation is it possible to create a guaranteed market at prices reasonable to all parties for a gradually axpanding home production, and to regulate imports in direct ratio to the ability of the home industry to offer an adequate substitute.45.     Import regulation would probably involve the creation of a loose form of national bacon control which would be exercised by a non-trading body empowered to Impose variable quotas upon, and In other ways regulate Imports and home output.    Provided that the operation of this control was restrictive in respect of both imports and home production it is understood that there would be no infringement of international treaty obligations even though the home quota was steadily raised and the import quota correspondingly reduced.    It would be an essential part of the plan that the home quota should be fixed in relation to the ability of the home curers to supply a given quantity of bacon In the quota period.    Satisfactory evidence to this
effect would probably take the form of long term contracts for pigs, and an undertaking to convert these pigs into bacon;    it would involve a high degree of organisation on the part of both producers and curers.     The details of this plan would require careful working out once approval was given to the principles involved.46.     We therefore recommend that the Government should constitute an ad hoc committee charged with the task of preparing a scheme for the organisation of the bacon industry and that the Minister&apos;s statement on agricultural policy should contain an assurance that, provided a satisfactory scheme is evolved, the Government is prepared to adopt some form of quantitative regulation of imports consistent with treaty obligations.4 7 * dome Grown Sugar.In view of the close relation between a home grown sugar policy and an empire sugar policy, the whole qiestion of sugar w duties, subsidies and quotas - has been referred to an ad hoc committee of representatives of the departments concerned and we, therefore, make no recommendation on the subject at this stage.20.
48.    Agricultural Workers.   In 1925 the level of agricultural prices was 59$ above pre-war.   The level of wages In England and Wales was 72% above, while the actual level of hourly wages was variously estimated at approximately 100$ above pre-war. To-day farm prices have fallen to 12$ above pre-war, while wages have remained practically at the 1925 level.   The agricultural wages machinery has. therefore, secured to the agricultural worker a fixed level of wages at a time when all prices have been falling and the workers in employment have therefore enjoyed a steady increase in the level of their real wages i3e. in their standard of living.    In the circumstances we do not consider that any modification of the existing wages machinery Is necessary in the interests of the workers.   That machinery does not, however, give security of employment.   Any increase of prosperity in agriculture which results from the Governments policy will reduce the present Insecurity of empl oyment *49-   We are, however, of opinion that any announcement of the Government policy respecting agriculture should include a statement of the facilities at present available for investigating complaints that the requirements of the Orders made under the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act are not being observed. Same members of the Committee consider that a specific under-taking should also be given to restore wholly or partially the special temporary Inspectorate which was recently dispensed with as a measure of economy,.50.   We consiiJer that the greatest benefit which the Government can confer on the agricultural workers would be to improve rural housing.
51&apos;       Agricultural Education and Research. We. recommend that the announcement, should include a statement to the effect that the Government recognise the,services which agricultural research and education have rendered to the agricultural community;    that they have reason to know that these services meet with steadily growing appreciation among farmers;    and,  that so far as financial circumstances permit, they propose to maintain and develop the organised system which already exi st s.52.     hand Settlement.We wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the agricultural and social importance of small holdings which provide a ladder for the agricultural labourer and we consider that the statement should include an assurance that a land settlement^polioy will be pursued within the limits of the financial resources available.
9 fi53.   The National Mark.   The National Mark as a means of securing the progressive standardisation of grading, packing etc. of home agricultural products is of vital importance to the industry.   The question of expense to public funds is the governing factor.   We accordingly emphasise the necessity of developing the National Mark movement and recommend that plans and investigations to this end should be proceeded with as rapidly as circumstances permit.Schemes covering a dozen or so products are already in operation and promise well.   Schemes are ready to be put into operation for honey, plums, jam and bottled fruits and vegetables Schemes will shortly be ready for cheese, mutton and lamb, and others will be formulated in due course when investigations are completed.Legislation dealing with the grading of beef and eggs andj if necessary, revising the lav/ with regard to the marking of stored eggs should be brought forward by the Agricultural Departments as soon as convenient.   We understand that this legislation is already Included in the Government^ legislative programme for the present Session.MATTERS SBECIFICALLY REFERRED TO THE COM&apos;ITTEE. 54. Supply of Home Produced Beef to His Majesty&apos;s Forces.This matter was specifically referred to the Committee by the Cabinet.   The War Office state that the extra cost of supplying fresh beef to the Army and Air Force throughout the year is estimated at some  500,000, on the assumption that the adoption of the  scheme does not lead to any increase in the price level of fresh beef.   We have considered a scheme limited to the supply of fresh beef on 4 days a week during a period of three months which it is estimated would cost an additional  70,000 per annum for the Army and Air Force and  12,000 per annum for the Navy.   In view of the fact that the service
Departments are not willing to take this extra charge on thejuf V:ar--Or% s4t5e Votefj^ we do not recommend that the proposal should he adopted at the present time. 55.    Allotment Gardens for the Unemployed.This subject has also been referred to the Committee by the Cabinet for consideration (Cabinet conclusion 88 (31) 6). In 1931 a Government scheme was put into operation to assist unemployed and partly unemployed persons to purchase seeds, fertilisers and implements for the cultivation of allotments. The total net co3t of the scheme in England and Wales for the 1931 cropping season is approximately  26,000, and the number of men assisted was 64,000.     A small sum was also expended In Scotland.     As a result of the Government decision, as a measure of economy, not to continue the scheme for the 1932 cropping season, the Society of Friends have issued an appeal for funds in order to enable the work to be carried on. It is understood that up to date they have succeeded in collecting approximately  15,000, which includes a contribution of  5,000 from the Pilgrim Trust.56.     There is no doubt that this scheme has considerable social value, though it is of no benefit to agriculture.     We are unable to recommend that any expenditure on this service should be at the expense of other agricultural services,  seeing that it is essentially an unemployment service.      If the Cabinet desire to reverse the decision not to make any Government grant towards the scheme, we recommend . that they should consider the question of assisting the Society of Friends on a   for   basis, the Government interest being watched by a representative on the Committee administering the fund.
THE FISHING INDUSTRY. I. Tariffs, on Fi3h. 57.     Tho British Trawlers Federation have been pressing for a rohibitive tariff on foreign demersal fish, that is, fish caught near he bottom of the sea, which includes all the white fish such as cod, addock, hake, plaice, soles, turbot, etc.     They state that during the ast twelve months the average price received for demersal fish of all kinds and grades at the ports has been below the cost of catching. His average price in 1931 was about 2d. per lb., specific prices anging, according to the kind and grade, from -Id. per lb. or less for ish sent to the meal factories to about l/6d. per lb. for the best oles.     In that year the retail price has not been appreciably lower han in recent years when the average port price was between 2d. and d. per lb.     The Trawlers Federation maintain that they require an verage price of about 2^d. in order to work at a profit.     The federation attribute their difficulties to foreign competition.     The smersal fish landed by foreign vessels in this country or imported as argo is equivalent to about 14^. of the total quantity of demersal fish landed in Great Britain and 17% of the total value of such fish.     We are advised that even if this fish were completely excluded from this ountry there would be no difficulty in replacing it by an equal quantity caught by British vessels provided the prices obtained were remunerative though supplies of some of the more costly kinds would be reduced.     On the whole, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is of opinion that as regards the cheaper kinds of fish which constitute the bulk of the landings the price to the consumer would be unaffected by a 10% tariff.     The value of foreign demersal fish landed or imported and retained in Great Britain amounted to about  3,100,000 in 1930. There seems to be no doubt that the trawling industry, like many other Industries at the present time, is as a whole being run at a loss, and J recommend that if there is to be a general tariff on Industrial and agricultural products, a general tariff should also be levied in like ijanner on fish of all kinds, including canned fish.
58.   We are unable to agree as to whether there slxould be a selective tariff on demersal and pelagic fish In the absence of a general tariff on other commodities.59.   We recommend that a selective tariff should be imposed on imported oysters for a specified period of the year, and on fresh lobsters, crabs and other Crustacea which are in the nature of luxuries.60.   We recommend a substantial tariff on foreign mussels. These imports (from the Netherlands) amount to about  9,000 per annum.   There are abundant supplies of mussels in this country, but the supply available for human food is curtailed by Orders closing a number of the best mussel beds on account of sewage pollution.    If provision can be made for cleansing these mussels, as is already done at Conway, any deficiency due to lack of foreign supplies can be readily made good.61.   Our home canning of herrings and sprats would probably develop under the influence of a tariff.    In particular, the Industry is said to be depressed at present by the growing Importation of cheap canned pilchards which are a by-product of the pilchard oil industry of California.   We recommend a selective tariff on canned pilchards, herring3 and sprats.62.   The whole question of Customs Duties on fish is too complicated for us to make more detailed proposals in this Report and we suggest that if the Cabinet agree In principle to the above recommendations, all the Departments concerned should be asked to prepare a detailed tariff scheme.63.   Reciprocal Trading Arrangements with Russia.We understand that the question of reciprocal trading arrangements with Russia will shortly come up for consideration and in this connection we emphasise the importance of securing a market in Russia for English and Scottish pickled herrings. In any negotiations on this subject it should be borne in mind that no decision granting free entry into this country to Siberian salmon should be taken pending the conclusion of the Ottawa Conference.
11* General Fishery Policy.64.   We have had circulated to us the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council on the Fishing Industry, which has been circulated to the Cabinet as C.P.1 (32).   This is a voluminous document, which we have not had time to examine closely.   We suggest, therefore, that the Report should be examined, by an Inter-Departmental Committee consisting of representatives of the Departments concerned and of the Secretariat of the Economic Advisory Council.SS.   The suggested selective tariffs and the Ottawa Conference.Some of the commodities which we have suggested for a selective tariff will no doubt come under review in connection with the Ottawa   Conference.   In respect of some of these commodities it will be neoessary from the point of view of home agriculture to impose duties at preferential rates on Empire products.   Also the question arises whether duties on these commodities should be imposed immediately or should be postponed until the Ottawa discussions take place.   We have not, however, given detailed consideration to the list from these points of view as we think that the matter can best be left for-further consideration when the general principles respecting tariffs have been settled by the Cabinet.66.   The Secretary of State for Scotland concurs in our conclusions and recommendations subject to the reservations set out In his note appended to this Report.

REPORT OF THE A6&amp;ICuIffU3AL POLICY COMMITTEE. Note &quot;by the Secretary of- State for Scotland.The Report of the Agricultural Committee represents the efforts of all its members - no doubt at the cost to each of them of some sacrifice for the time being of opinion on matters of great and even fundamental importance - to arrive at a common measure of agreement on action which can immediately be taken to increase the production of food stuffs and to stimulate the development of the farming industry in this country.    Subject, therefore, to certain reservations which I feel bound to make, I gladly associate myself with the principal recommendations of the Report.The controversial feature of the Report is of course the tariff issue, and it Is my duty to make it plain to my colleagues that my general view of duties on food stuffs is not only that they are calculated to foster inefficiency in the industry and to raise prices to the consumer but that they are contrary to the pledges, which the National Government gave to the electors at the General Election through the mouth of the Prime Minister speaking at Easing ton on the 12th October, that there must not be &quot;an extra oppression upon the lives of the mass of the working people of this country.&quot;This general statement, however, must be qualified in three respects.   Firstly, if all other industries are to be protected, the exclusion of agriculture would give the farmers astrong and legitimate grievance; secondly, the principle of excluding luxury imports in the interests of the balance oftrade has already been extended to food stuffs, and might befurther extended and applied to luxury fish; thirdly such duties would, in my opinion, be defensible if applied with adequateguarantees of efficiency in production as part of a constructivepolicy conceived as much in the interests of the consumer as of the produoer. --1-
In the latter&apos;&quot;ca-te^;oT*y&quot; T&apos; place, -the. JjL5.Ur- Pclicy--which -the Committee have adopted, but I -^ish to emphasise that the Committee unanimously agreed that it should be a tripartite policy - of which the three parts are  z-(a) An attach to be launched immediately and vigor-ously pressed home upon bovine tuberculosis and in the near future upon other bovine diseases with the objectof lowering the costs of production in the dairy industry, expanding its markets, and making the milk supply of . the people safe and cheap,,(b) The re-organisation of marketings(c) The imposition of duties on certain categories of milk (the Committee agreed almost unanimously that tinned skimmed condensed milk should not be Included, nor in my opinion should fresh milk be taxed) to give encouragement to the producers and to finance (a) and (b) above.On the other hand duties on eggs, and poultry seem tome very difficult to justify.      Here is a strong, prosperousresilient industry making progress each year and already in afair way to recapture the home market from the foreigner,,      total the egg consumer is undoubtedly to put &quot;an extra oppression&quot;upon the working classes, without even being able to plead thatthe industry is exposed to &quot;unfair&quot;, or even successful, foreigncompetition,      The poultry population of this country has steadilyincreased in recent years as the following figures show (taken from page 53 of &quot;The Agricultural Output and the Food Supplies ofGreat Britain&quot; -- 1929):-Estimated supplies of Poultry,,Pre^Wars. &apos; Post-War,, (1925) a quantity,.

During the past three years, while the proportion of home production to total supplies has remained approxi-mately unchanged at about 2/3,  the former has increased by approximately 200,000 cwts,,   (18%).Prom the same source the following figures are taken with regard to eggs;-Estimated Supplies of Eggs?&apos; RlZ9-y$Zs.

This plan broke down because sufficient supplies of standard quality were not available.
This experience points to toe constractiTe&apos; way -of&quot;stimulating the egg and poultry industry in this country(i)    The marking of imported dead poultry with the country of origin(ii)    Legislation for the sale of eggs (a) by weight,  and (b)  in a clean and frenh condition,(iii)    The prohibition of the description of foreign eggs as &quot;New Laid!,0(iv)    The marking of foreign preserved eggs as chilled -(home preserved eggs have now to hear such a mark.)Tho Committee proposes also to put a tax upon Importedfruit pulp,      I ventured myself to suggest to the Cabinet inmy memorandum C.P0  292 (31)  that the question of a tax uponimported fruit pulp ought to be examined, and I wholly agreewith my colleagues on the Committee that the case for the exclusion of this pulp is strongs     On the other hand v/e were informed on the highest possible authority that if this pulp were excluded there was a risk, not only of &quot;wrecking the jam industry&quot;but at second remove of crippling the canning industry.    This Is anew industry with abounding vitality -which affords an important and increasing market.for our fruit and vegetable products;    withoutany protection,    subsidy or an.;/ other form of State aid It hasincreased its output as followsFruit. Vegetables. Total.(Cans) (Cans) (Cans)1927    5,540,000 2^300,000 7,800,0001931 27,000*000 559000,000 83,000,000It may indeed be admitted that we as a Committee were concerned with agriculture and not with the canning industry but anything which injured the canning industry which &quot;uses 9q&amp; of home produced fruit and vegetables would be a disservice to the vegetable and fruit-growing industries of this country.     At a recent conference between the National Farmers&apos; Union and the
the representatives of the cannere it was stated that the canning factories could &quot;enormously increase their purchases of home grown fruit but must have the assurance of constant supplies&quot;, and that they hoped to &quot;contract to take the whole of the produce from stated farms for a period of5 say, five years at prices to be fixed by mutual consent&quot;.The Committee have not considered whether the result which the tariff is intended to achieve might not be attained without the risks which it involves by agreement between the producers of fruit and vegetables on the one hand and the representatives of the canning and jam industries on the other hand.      At any rate I do not feel justified in joining in a recommendation for a duty until we arc quite sure what its effect would be on these other industries whose fortunes are inseparably linked with those of agriculture.Apart from the commodities with which I have already dealt and barley for which I hope the quota system will be found suitable,  as I doubt very much whether the objections to a tariff so clearly indicated in the Report can he overcome., the Committee proposes to the Cabinet that duties should be imposed on the wide range of articles scheduled in paragraph 25(b),Undoubtedly these duties on Cider, Perry, preserved fruit,, dried and preserved vegetables, oat products, barcey products., maize flour, miscellaneous flour and meal, miscellaneous manufactured cereals, yeast and plants (rose trees and certain nursery stock), will be represented - and indeed exaggeratedly misrepresented -as &quot;an extra oppression&quot;, although the whole value of the imports from abroad - including those from Empire countries, which would presumably continue to enter and perhaps in increased quantities -is only  405 million or loSfi of the total.      Such duties, trivial from the standpoint of the producers, would he certain to irritate and perhaps to antagonise millions of consumers, and from the political standpoint each would be a weapon In the armoury of the Opposition,,
TART VP, Oil riSH.I agree that in the event of a general tariff on manufactured goods end food stuffs there is no special reason for excluding imports of fish, subject to  the understanding, however, that effective means are adopted to safeguard the position of the herring and cured white fish industries.    Both of these are export industries,  the value of  their exports amounting to over five million pounds. vThe situation and prospects of the former are declared in the report recently circulated by the Economic Advisory Council to present problems far mere serious than those of the trawling industry, while the latter works on the narrowest margins and is wholly dependent on ample supplies of cheap raw material,      The risk of retaliation by other countries against our exports cf herrings cannot be ignored,,I cannot, however,   accept the suggestion in Parat57 that, the retail price in 1951 has not been appreciably luwer than in recent years when the port price was higher.The Index Port Prices in 1929 and 1931 were 90 and 72o The Ministry cf Labour:&apos;,s Index Retail Fish Prices for 1929 and 1931 were 114 and 105a      Taking fish retailed at 9d.  per lbc  the fall in average price ie therefore about -fd. per lb.    The average port price of this fish is about 4-gd. per lb.  and the fall since 1929 is .9d.    cr (say)  Id.- per lb.    Therefore the retail price has only lagged 4a. behind the port price.Nor can I agree with the opinion cf the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries expressed in paragraph 57 that as regards the cheaper kinds of fish the price to the consumer wculd be unaffected by a 10% tariff.    In my opinion it is clear from the analysis made by the Fuel Council in 1927 (Report on Fish Prices - p.p.25,  26, and 46) and from the index figures of wholesale and retail fish prices that the consequent increase
\J oIrt-tlie-catrCJaer^B-price-would result in a substantially-equal increase in the prioe to the consumer in retail shops and in fried fish shops though in the latter case the increase might be disguised by the supply of smaller portions or an inferior quality.V/ith regard to the application of the British Trawlers&apos; Federation for a tariff sufficient to increase their average port prices of white fish by about 25% it appears to me that the brief statement in paragraph 57 fails to indicate the weaicness of the Federation&apos;s case for a protective tariff.     The foreign imports have become lower in 1931 than in any years from 1925 to 1930 (both inclusive)..I agree with the recommendations contained in paragraph 59 for the imposition of duties on oysters and other luxury fish, but I find it more difficult to agree to duties on mussels, canned pilchards, herrings and sprats.    Protective duties on such fish would seem to me of little use to the industry and likely to be irritating to the consumer..      In regard to canned pilchards in. particular the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries admitted that their information about the imports was incomplete.Lastly while warmly agreeing with the emphasis placed by the Committee upon the importance of securing a market in Russia for English and Scottish pickled herrings j, I venture strongly to demur to the suggestion that, pending the conclusion of the Ottawa Conference, we should refuse to grant free entry to Siberian salmon even if by giving such an undertaking we could obtain a substantial advantage for the herring fishing industry.     The strongest weapon we can use for this purpose is the import of canned salmon from Russia, the value of which In 1930 was more than  2,600,000.On the one hand we were informed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries that Canada&apos;s capacity for expansion in the canned salmon industry is limited.     From the standpoint of British export -rade and from the amount of employment which it affords, the Erring fishing Industry is the most important branch of the Ashing industry.       Yet the Committee/r-7-
Committee of the Economic Advisory Council finds that &quot;its situation and prospects present problems far more serious than those cf the trawling industry&quot;.    It is doubtful whether there Is any branch of British industry which yields a lower return tr those engaged in it than the herring fishing industry.      I would therefore plead with my colleagues to allow this weapon to be used to the full by the Department of Overseas Trade in order tc recover our lost Russian market which before the War (including as it then did the Baltic States and part of Poland) absorbedno less thanlOfo of the total British cure.(Signed)ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR.th Jarnary. 1932*
