THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTBUCKET.CP. 10 (32).DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on Policy in regard to theLimitation of Air Armaments.1. THE Report of the Cabinet Disarmament Committee (CP. 322) deals with a number of issues of a technical nature which will arise at the forthcoming Disarmament Conference. I feel, however, that the question of the attitude of Great Britain with regard to the limitations of air armaments is so important as to justify my bringing it before my colleagues for separate consideration.2.   The Draft Convention suggests four limitations : (i) By numbers of effectives, (ii) By numbers of aircraft.(iii) By total amount of horse-power in aircraft.(iv) By a total figure for all defence expenditure.I will not here discuss the question of horse-power limitation (which is a highly technical one) further than to say that no practical method has yet been devised which satisfies expert opinion.3. The main issue is the limiting number of aircraft which will be the determining factor, both as regards numbers of effectives and expenditure. In this connection I would draw attention to the situation described in my recent Paper CP. 296 (31), and emphasize the fact that at the present moment this country is only the fifth air Power in the world (on the basis of first line strength) in spite of the fact that we use air power overseas in a manner and to an extent not attempted by any other Power.4. The first question to be decided is : Are we to perpetuate this condition of affairs in the limiting figure put forward for the Draft Convention, or are we to claim some figure more in keeping with our responsibilities at home and abroad ? My own view is that for every reason we are bound to claim the right to equality in the air with any other European Power whether we propose to build up to this claim or not; and, in the first instance, I would ask my colleagues to endorse this principle as the basis of our attitude at this Conference.5. We must then consider what strength we should actually claim. I felt that on this point the Cabinet should have at first hand the views of my respon-sible adviser, the Chief of the Air Staff, and these are given in the paper annexed hereto. It will be seen that the Air Staff consider that for effective parity with France the strongest air Power in the world at the present time Great Britain should have 1,432 machines at home (metropolitan total) and 521 machines over-seas, as compared with the French figures of 1,432 metropolitan aircraft (this figure including 160 bombing aircraft easily movable by air from North Africa) and 235 other aircraft overseas.6. The reasons for the higher numbers are, in general, the geographical handicap imposed on this country for home defence; and the use made by this country of air power in substitution for land forces in territories such as Iraq, the Sudan, Aden, &amp;c. As compared with France, our position is complicated, not only by our overseas requirements, but also by the fact that the strength of the Fleet Air Arm is determined rather in relation to the strongest naval Power (the United States of America) than to France. It is impossible to say how many of the Fleet Air Arm aircraft will, on any given occasion, be available for any except purely naval purposes, either at home or overseas.[6385] b
7. Although a completely adequate case for the figures put forward by the Air Staff can be made out, I imagine my colleagues will see considerable difficulty in this country&apos;s claiming at the Disarmament Conference any higher quota for our Air Forces than that represented by global world-over parity on a one-power standard basis, as measured by the strongest air Power, which is France. There is, however, no real basis of comparison between our global or total requirements and those of France. In consequence, while I am of opinion that in due course we may have to consider what concessions we can make and what risks we can take in order to make our just claims appear less embarrassing, I refrain for the present from attempting to give expression, in terms of figures, to the measure of the concessions which it may eventually be politic to make. A practical consideration is that the present disparity between the size of our air forces and those of France is so great that it would in any case be a good many years before we could actually build up to the strength equal in numbers to the present French Air Force.8. There is one other point I would emphasize and that is that the claim put forward is necessarily relative, and that if the French are prepared, as is earnestly to be hoped, to reduce their air forces, from the present figure of 1,667, our own limiting figure wrould of course also be subject to reconsideration. I have for some time been considering what inducement could be offered to the French to bring about such a reduction, and I have been much attracted by the idea put forward in 1928 (CP. 170) by the present Secretary of State for India (when Secretary of State for Air) of a tripartite agreement on first-line air strengths between this country, France and Italy. We already have certain obligations (which have never been defined) under the Treaty of Locarno. Would it be possible, as a method of approach to a real reduction in French armaments, to hint at the possibility of some more concrete obligation as regards air powrer, and bring in Italy as well as France, Germany and ourselves % I feel that the political objections to such obligations would apply much less strongly in the case of the Air Force than in the case of the Army, and put this suggestion forward for consideration as a possible approach to one of the main problems of the Disarmament Conference.L.Air Ministry, January 5, 1932.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.1. IN previous papers* I have described in some detail the general situation in relation to air armaments in the world to-day. I showed that in spite of our evident needs in the matter of air defence, we are to-day only the fifth Air Power and that we are placed in a position of such serious disparity that we cannot contemplate the stabilisation of national air armaments at their existing relative levels. The attached map 1 presents a visual picture which shows at a glance the balance and distribution of air armaments in the Eastern Hemisphere.There is no evidence that foreign countries, in advancing their claims at the Disarmament Conference, will undertake to reduce their air armaments. On the contrary, France has made it abundantly clear that she has no intention of reducing; Italy is likely to claim parity of strength with France; Japan has put forward an extensive programme both of land based and sea based aircraft; while other countries have notified the League that their air armaments are in course of development or evolution. In no quarter is there any indication of a willingness to reduce Air Forces.On this account and because of our present marked inferiority, the consideration of our air disarmament policy and of the resulting claims which it wall be necessary to put forward at the Disarmament Conference, is a matter of urgency and importance.The entry into force of a Disarmament Convention will bring about an entirely new set of conditions. If our present position is unsatisfactory we are  apart from the armament truce at liberty to improve our defences and to adjust the relative level of our air armaments.   Once the Disarmament Convention is in* D.C.P. 11 and Annesures &quot; (J &quot; and &quot; D &quot; to K.A.I. 16-A.
1 ^7force any subsequent adjustments of relative levels, if not altogether imprac-ticable, would certainly be a matter of extreme difficulty.It will be appreciated that any limiting figures for air armaments once accepted by this or any other country cannot be altered without the unanimous consent of the Council of the League. As Germany has no air force, and has a permanent seat on the Council, any future upward revision of the limiting figures fixed at the first Disarmament Conference is likely to be vetoed. The derogation powers provided by Article 50 of the Draft Convention cover temporary increases only.While the Convention can be denounced, denunciation does not take effect until after a lapse of two years, and in no circumstances during the initial period of the Convention.We cannot, therefore, contemplate the acceptance of limiting figures at a level which might subsequently be found to be inadequate.2. It remains to examine the major defence requirements which must be allowed for in any scheme for limitation of our air forces. For brevity and simplicity this examination is confined to consideration of &apos;&apos; first-line&apos;&apos; strength in aircraft, which provides the most satisfactory method of international comparison and index of military strength.3.   The problem has two main aspects : (a) our requirements as regards &quot;Metropolitan&quot; air forces, and(b) our requirements as regards &quot;Overseas&quot; air forces.4. In the Metropolitan sphere these requirements are predominantly determined by the scale of attack to which this country is exposed from the airr that is to say, on the strength of the French air forces. In other words, our Metropolitan requirements must be closely related to the size of the Metropolitan air forces maintained by France.Map 2 illustrates the position as between this country and France, and obviates the necessity for any further-explanation of the disadvantages of our geographical situation, and of our present altogether unsatisfactory relative position in air strength. We occupy an isolated position, beyond the range of air reinforcements from our overseas contingents, and we are confronted by the largest air force in the world. The French Metropolitan air forces outnumber us by nearly three to one, and, in addition to that, are able to draw upon reinforcements from their North African air garrisons.There are at present 1,210 first-line aircraft stationed in France itself, and not less than 160 more immediately available as reinforcements from North Africa. We have 436 first-line aircraft stationed in England, supported by 127 special reserve and auxiliary air force machines organised on a militia basis. It is obviously impossible to contemplate stabilisation at these relative levels.5. As regards the &quot; Overseas &quot; quota, requirements are mainly dependent upon our responsibilities and on the availability of reinforcements, in relation to the following commitments : (i) the maintenance of air defence forces, including those providedfor internal security in Iraq, Aden and elsewhere, (ii) protection for lines of communication, (iii) coastal reconnaissance and defence.Map 1 shows the distribution of our. own and other existing national Air Forces, and illustrates the overwhelming odds with which our isolated Mediterranean and Far Eastern air contingents may be confronted. None of our overseas contingents can at present be reinforced by air from Great Britain, nor have we any manufacturing facilities overseas.The present position is that we have made adequate provision only for that portion of our overseas requirements which represent the forces necessary for the maintenance of internal security in Iraq and Aden. No provision has so far been made for coast defence, though considerable numbers will be necessary, either as the main coast defence armament or as ancillaries to the older system of gun defences. We have at present 153 first-line aircraft stationed overseas. The French, whose requirements are not strictly comparable to our own and who do not rely upon aircraft for maintaining internal security in any area, have 395. [6385] &apos; b 2
&apos; 6. The negotiation of limiting figures for Air Forces is complicated by-certain special problems: firstly, in connection with Fleet Air Arms; and secondly, because of the influence of civil aviation upon air disarmament questions.7. As regards the Fleet Air Arm, His Majesty&apos;s Government would reasonably claim that the &quot; parity &quot; in Naval forces as between the U.S.A. and ourselves, which is the basis of the London Naval Treaty, should equally be reflected in the air forces allotted to the respective Fleets.It is, however, impossible to treat ship-borne aircraft as a separate issue in the matter of disarmament. The French will claim that our Fleet Air Arm or ship-borne aircraft are a potential menace to France. This contention cannot be denied, more especially as the French only claim to have a Fleet Air Arm of 62 aircraft and 1 aircraft carrier, whereas we now have 153 aircraft and 5 carriers. Moreover, any attempt to treat Fleet Air Arms separately from the remainder of air armaments would immediately lead to corresponding claims in respect of aircraft specially allotted to co-operate with military forces, in which capacity the French have 360 aircraft as against our 60. On the one hand, therefore, we shall have the French claiming that our Fleet Air Arm shall be reckoned with our Metropolitan air forces. On the other hand, we cannot rely upon being able to divert these aircraft from fleet duties to the defence of this country.Lastly, we do not yet know the significance in terms of figures of &apos;&apos; parity &apos;&apos; on ship-borne aircraft with America. In this matter I had hoped that Admiralty requirements would be satisfied by negotiating for Fleet Air Arm parity &quot; at a level more or less in keeping with existing strengths.&quot; The Admiralty have, however, recently assessed, the &apos;&apos; minimum requirements&apos;&apos; of the Fleet (and that only until 1936) at 405 aircraft a figure considerably in excess both of the present carrying capacity of the Fleet and of the existing strength of the Fleet Air Arm (153).It will therefore be appreciated that the formulation at the Disarmament Conference of our total air requirements for limitation purposes will be very materially affected by the standard of strength contemplated for the Fleet Air Arm.8. Civil aviation complicates the disarmament issue in a number of ways. Civil aviation aircraft, civil aviation industries, and the corresponding air organisation, are an asset of definite military value.Recent suggestions for the &quot; internationalisation &quot; of civil aviation reflect the apprehensions felt on account of future development of civil aviation. There is, perhaps, little prospect of any such proposals being put into effect, nor in my judgment have they any practical bearing upon the immediate problems of air disarmament.It is, however, essential that civil aviation be taken into account in the international settlement of air armaments. Failure to do so would introduce an element of dangerous instability into any agreement as to military air forces, and might well lead to a &quot;race in air armaments,&quot; or, alternatively, to the forced development of civil aviation on lines designed to subserve military ends. From a disaimiament point of view, the risks arising from civil aviation reside not so much in the menace of civil aircraft when diverted to military usages, as in the danger that civil aviation developments will be used as an excuse to expand air armaments.This question is one of particular significance to us, since normal demands and our geographical circumstances will prevent us from developing an internal civil aviation fleet comparable to those of our continental neighbours.The solution of this problem and the avoidance of the dangers which I have indicated depends upon the adoption of a system of limitation for air armaments which will prevent the expansion of air forces but permit of their technical improvement. The policy recommended in the following paragraphs contains proposals designed to secure that end.9. As regards the methods of limitation of air armaments, I would again emphasize that &quot; first-line&quot; strengths of military aircraft provide the essential and only satisfactory basis of international comparison.   The introduction of
-other methods of comparison or limitation would greatly increase the difficulty -of securing international agreement and would add little of value to the limitation of first-line aircraft. In particular, it is necessary to emphasize the undesirability of attempting to superimpose budgetary limits upon the limitation of first-line aircraft. It is generally admitted that the basis of expenditure provides an altogether misleading standard of comparison of the strength of air forces of different countries, but such comparisons nevertheless become inevitable once the principle of budgetary limitation is admitted. Moreover, it is clear that budgetary limits would only be accepted at a figure in excess of requirements and would consequently not act as a restriction. Furthermore, as Mr. Adams, Secretary to the United States Navy, recently observed, budgetary statistics can be interpreted in a manner &quot;insidiously inimical&quot; to national interests and in &quot; a manner favourable to the defence interests &quot; of other Powers. These embarrassing possibilities are not confined to America. Lastly, any -attempt to restrict air armaments by means of budgetary limitations can be largely negatived by &quot;legitimate&quot; and unrestricted expenditure upon civil -aviation.10. As stated in paragraph 1 above, the conditions underlying the application of the Disarmament Convention as a whole make it impracticable for us to accept limiting figures which at a later date might require revision in an upward direction. In framing our policy in regard to air armaments, it is accordingly necessary to bear in mind that any attempt to impose an over-rigid and complicated system of restriction will increase the difficulties of arriving at international agreement and will involve difficulties and dangers of its own.11.   Bearing these factors in mind I suggest that we should : (1) accept no further forms of limitation upon air armaments beyond those already contained in the Draft Disarmament Convention : i.e.(i) by numbers of &quot;effectives,&quot;(ii) by numbers of aircraft in commission and in immediate reserve, (iii) by limitation of tataZ-defence-expenditure.(2) refuse to accept the impracticable and undesirable horse-power limitation.(3) concentrate upon establishing a balanced system of national ratios based upon first-line strengths, i.e., upon numbers of aircraft maintained in use or in immediate reserve in operational units.12. It remains to indicate in terms of first-line aircraft, the nature and &apos;extent of the resulting claims which under the system of limitation described above we should advance at the Disarmament Conference.The requirements of India and of the Dominions who contract separately at the Disarmament Conference for such armaments as they require are not now in question.I have already shown that our existing air forces a,re entirely inadequate vis-a-vis existing foreign air armaments, and in respect of our home defence and overseas commitments. It follows that, unless we are to see very substantial reductions in French and other foreign air forces, our claim for air armaments at &quot; the lowest level consistent with national safety &quot; must necessarily involve the claim of right to effect considerable increases in our air forces, both at home and abroad.The limitations figures proposed in the following paragraphs are based upon two major assumptions : (i) That the French air forces remain at their existing strength; (ii) That the future (limitation) strength of the Fleet Air Arm will not exceed the numbers of first-line aircraft (241) envisaged by the pro-gramme of development to which the Admiralty have been working since 1926 (the present strength of the Fleet Air Arm being 153 first-line aircraft).In addition, as the normal distribution of the Fleet results in the Fleet Air Arm being stationed in about equal proportions in home waters and overseas, I classify, for purposes of convenience, the two halves as &quot; Metropolitan &quot; and &quot;overseas&quot; respectively.
13. As regards our limitation requirements for Metropolitan or home-defence aircraft, the disadvantages of our geographical situation require that we should claim the equivalent of effective military strength with the French air forces stationed in, and within range of, France. The assessment of effective military strength in terms of first-line aircraft is a matter of difficulty. Our longer service, voluntarily enlisted air forces are, unit for unit, superior in quality to those of the French : but we are at a marked and irremediable geo-graphical disadvantage owing to the far greater accessibility of London than Paris (or any other vital French centre) to attack from the air. Making allowance for these factors, I would assess our limitation requirements at the following totals: &quot; Metropolitan &quot; Air Forces.Great Britain. France.Limitation Requirements. Existing&apos; Strengths.Land based aircraft .... 1,311 1,210Fleet Air Arm     .... .... 121 (present 62strength 78)Available reinforcements  .... Nil 160 (from north Africa)&apos;Total .... 1,432 1,432For limitations purposes three aircraft belonging to the Auxiliary Air Force and non-Regular portion of the Special Eeserve should be, I suggest, reckoned as the equivalent of one aircraft of the regular Air Force.14. Turning now to overseas requirements, in which sphere no clear-cut &apos;&apos; parity &apos;&apos; issue arises, and where our limitation claims are built up from a number of specific requirements in various areas and for various purposes (see paragraph 5 above), I estimate that, subject to no substantial increases being put forward in the strength of foreign air armaments, we should require the following total of first-line aircraft (for purposes of rough comparison I include the corresponding French figures) : &quot; Overseas &quot; Air Forces.Great Britain. France.Limitation Requirements. Existing Strength.Land based aircraft .... 401 395*Fleet Air Arm     .... .... 120 (present strength 75)Total .... 521 395* 160 of these are also shown under French &quot; Metropolitan &quot; Forces as they can be moved by air-from North Africa at short notice.15.   On this basis, the grand total of our limitation requirements amounts to a figure of Jl 8-E3 aircraft, as against a corresponding existing French figure of&quot; .....567.   The totals are made up as indicated in the table below : Total First-line Strengths in Aircraft.Great Britain. France.Limitation Requirements. Existing- Strength.Land based aircraft Metropolitan.... .... 1,311 1,210Overseas      .... .... 401 395Fleet Air Arm Metropolitan.... .... 121 62Overseas .... 120Total1,9531,667
16. There is, therefore, a wide discrepancy between our limitation require-ments as thus formulated and the existing strength of our air forces, which stands .at a total of 785* first-line aircraft. This position, as I have endeavoured to show, is mainly created by the present predominance of the air forces maintained by the French, a drastic reduction of which it should be the object of the disarmament Conference to achieve.J. M. SALMOND,Chief of the Air Staff.December 31, 1931.o* Includes 127 non-regular aircraft (special reserve and auxiliary air force) reckoned at -i- or 43.o,(See paragraph 13 : last sentence.)
