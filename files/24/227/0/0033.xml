This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1932.SECRET.CP. 33 (32).THE CABINET.future of the royal army clothing department.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The Royal Army Clothing Factory (normal strength about 1,030 civilians, mostly      6o women) which has been established at Pimlico since some time in the middle of the last Factories Century, and which is employed in making up uniform clothing, &amp;c, has for many     936 years been very uneconomic in its working :  25,000 a year would be saved on prices by transferring the work to the Trade.Efforts have been made to improve this situation, but the traditions of the Factory, its inconvenient location, and the antiquated character of its buildings all militate against success.The lease of the Factory in any event expires in 1937, and is not likely to be renewable, but very favourable terms for premature surrender in 1933 have been agreed with the ground landlord, the Grosvenor Estate.Capital for re-establishing the Factory elsewhere cannot be found, nor if it could be, would the discharge of the great bulk of the existing staff be obviated. They have no rights to transfer elsewhere, and it would be very uneconomical to transfer them.In the circumstances it is now proposed either to abolish the Factory altogether, or, alternatively, to reduce it to a small factory of some 200 people for the manufacture of full dress ; the choice will depend on whether the Trade, who have not yet made full dress, can succeed in doing- so. The small factory, if established, would be located at Woolwich.These measures will entail the discharge, with gratuity but without pension, of some 800 to 1,000 people, mainly women. Out of these, 250 are already being discharged owing to shortage of work in 1931-32 ; the rest would go in the summer of 1932, but no notice has been given them, and no public announcement of policy made.The Clothing Store Depot, which is also at Pimlico, will remain there till 1933, when it is proposed that the lease should be surrendered, and will then be moved to Didcot; this move may no doubt entail some further discharges, and will secure further economies.None of the measures proposed does more than anticipate what would probably happen in any event in 1937 when the lease expires, and none of them involves any decrease in national employment, except what will result from more economic production.The whole case has been put to the Treasury, who have approved.H.The Wab Office,Wth January, 1932.Copy No.(.B32/8)   60   1/32   W.O.P.   5979
