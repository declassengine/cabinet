THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC? MAJESTVS government most SECRET.. Copy No.     3 7[TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.]THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE.A MEMORANDUM has been called for on &quot;the British position in relation to European policy.&apos;&apos; It has also, I understand, been contemplated that such a paper might take the form of a note to be sent to Geneva and published like the French disarmament memorandum of July. If this is the intention, I submit that the document must be taken in two stages; for the title &apos;&apos; the British position in relation to European policy&quot; immediately indicates something at once too confidential and too intimately outspoken to serve for publication. For reasons to be developed later, I venture to doubt whether the publication in advance of any document will not seriously disserve our cause and purpose. In the first instance, at all events, it will be necessary to take stock en famille of our own position; and this will involve putting to ourselves in plain words some disagreeable facts which have really long been present to our minds. It will be time enough to consider a second stage of publication when we have-faced, and taken our decisions upon, them or chosen between two evils. We must, in fact, know and define &quot;the British position&quot; before we can proclaim it. And before we can define it &quot;in relation to European policy,&quot; we must have some account of European policy.2. I therefore submit a short verbal map of the past year, and could wish it were in brighter colour. The account shall be as brief as possible, though at this crisis of our, and of world, history some detail cannot be avoided. I trust that I may be pardoned if, with a view to such brevity, I quote from, or refer to, various papers that I have in the past written on this and kindred subjects. Some account has already been given in my two memoranda &apos;1 An Aspect of International Relations &quot; at the beginning of 1930 and 1931 respectively. The latter document was before the Cabinet at its meeting of the 15th December. I would also call attention to my memorandum, Secret, 1056-B, of the 25th June, 1931, on the ten years&apos; assumption of peace. There is not much change for the better to be recorded since the review of 1931, except in the case of Italy, and, in some ephemeral and accidental degree, the case of Russia, which will be dealt with later. Italy has collaborated most loyally and satisfactorily with us throughout our prolonged triangular negotiations with France in regard to naval matters in striking contrast with France; her views on reparations are near akin to our own; Signor Mussolini has entirely dropped the unprofitable bellicose note/largely under the courageous influence of that growing statesman, Signor Grandi; he has developed a positive pacifascism and is probably, for financial, if for no other, reasons, disposed to some genuine measure of disarmament; and he has repeatedly declared himself a treaty-revisionist an ultimate end which we also should have in mind, as explained in the conclusion of my 1931 memorandum although I still feel that he is hazy as to what he specifically means by the expression, which is dangerous in the mouth of such an annexationist State as Italy. Finally, I have secret reason to suspect, and to hope, that, although Italy has not abated her absorptionist policy in Albania, she may be contemplating a resumed attempt at understanding with Yugoslavia, for the failure of which Italy has lately been chiefly to blame. Whether this will go far enough to be fruitful renmins to be seen; but success would go far to eliminate one of the danger spots/ 6152   [6393] &apos;bf^/
of Europe, for it would, by the same stroke, react most favourably upon Yugo-slav-Bulgarian relations, which are at present another anxiety. Were France, however, to get wind of this possibility, the Old Adam in the old Balkan game might still be strong enough to call forth a -thwarting pressure upon her protegee and dependent.3. For this Old Adam is, of a truth, still strong in Europe; indeed, he has been gaining in strength throughout the year and the continent, in a manner well calculated to fortify the taste of the grocer in Mr. Galsworthy&apos;s &quot;Loyalties.&quot; &quot;Well, I prefer my own countrymen, and that&apos;s the truth of it.&quot; This is particularly the case in Germany, where every election has brought fresh access of strength to the Nazis; and, though M. Francois-Poncet professes to prefer them to Dr. Briining, this is, indeed, making a vice of necessity. It need only be added that French policy has done everything to play into their hands and to handicap the Doctor, whom we sincereby, and the French Government at least professedly, have desired to sustain.4. French policy has, in fact, continued to be shortsighted and disappoint-ing. On p. 34 of the memorandum of 1931 it will be seen, that I had in mind the possibility of a long-range policy in co-operation with France. The events of the past twelvemonth have but increased the difficulty of real co-operation with France; and we must not bemuse ourselves with a mere word. Chapter and verse are at hand for this view.   They are as follows :  (a) The French attitude hitherto in regard to reparations.   This needsno development in a paper directed to disarmament.(b) The French attitude in regard to disarmament, reaffirmed in the Julymemorandum. This has been well summarised in the Chiefs of Staff Memorandum, C.O.S. 277 of the 24th September, and in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum of the 12th December. Its text is still &quot;no advance without security&quot;; and its thesis is that Europe should remain perpetually divided into immutable sheep and dishorned goats.   There is little here of progress or settlement.(c) The French attitude in regard to naval agreement, which has beencharacterised throughout the year by ill-faith, obstinacy and discourtesy, seeing that we have not even had an answer to our last and very reasonable proposal. Our views and interests are so far apart that, if, for instance, she does not reduce her submarines by some 40,000 tons at this conference, we shall have to face the necessity and expense of increasing our destroyer tonnage.5. No one, of course, contemplates any avoidable friction with France. We are, in any case, in no position for high words or dudgeon with our nearest and most powerful neighbour, who has of late virtually attained the very thing that we have traditionally sought to avoid in Europe, hegemony, if not dictatorship, political and financial. The advocates of &quot; co-operation &quot; with France must, however, show us on what specific points it is practicable otherwise than by concession on our part. (&quot; The desire for a preliminary Franco-British agreement is general; but as is usual and natural in such circumstances it is apt to be based on the assumption that Great Britain should and will accept the essential principles of French policy in advance.&quot; The Paris correspondent of the &quot; Times &quot; on reparations, the 31st December.) If such co-operation is to have any real meaning, a point has been reached where a contribution must now be made by France. It will be remembered that, when &quot; Candide &quot; arrives at Portsmouth just in time to see Admiral Byng shot for not going near enough to the French, he observes that the French must have been as far from the English as the English from the French. This is unfortunately not the case at the close of 1931; the French have been considerably further from us than Ave from them. The historian of the future will not be indulgent to French and American post war policy. Both have been blind and selfish, and the former has been unduly vindictive as well. Every allowance is made for the psychology of fear, though the fear is more probably of invasion than defeat an important distinction seeing the known and enormous disparity of present strength and the guarantee of Locarno, which^&apos; y 1
is a guarantee against defeat, but not against invasion; and we must recognise with the Chiefs of Staff that &quot;it is questionable whether two out of the three invasions in the last 100 years, which are so often quoted, were calamities entirely unprovoked by France.&quot; Fear is, in fact, now to some considerable extent diluted by the human desire to prolong the pleasurable sensation of being on top. Later in this paper I venture to submit a suggestion whereby this fear, if genuine, may be turned to good account.6. It should, in fairness, be added that there are now some signs that the spread of economic depression may be the beginning of wisdom. A leading-member of the Comite&apos; des Forges admitted the other day that reparations were dead-a statement unthinkable in such a quarter six, or even three, months ago. We have, moreover, something to hope from the probable fall of the present French Government M. Laval is a politician and little else and from the May elections, which are likely to go Left. As a prominent member of the Socialist Radical Congress remarked to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador: &quot;The present Government always seems to say 1 No &apos;; we would try to say &apos; Yes.&apos; &quot;7. In taking clear stock of things as they are in France, we must be careful to guard against any undue leaning to Germany. &quot; The Nazis are coming.&quot; Their violent, and often ridiculous, programme is known. We need not recapitulate the twenty-five points. Hitler seems to be trying to instil some, at least ostensible, moderation into his wild and dense followers. His success remains to be seen. There is lamentably little&quot; ability in the party. The old German spirit is abroad in plenty and predominance, contained only at present by a tight belt. I repeat, at random, one example among many, to wit, the Berlin correspondent of the &quot; Times &quot; on the banning of &quot; All Quiet on the Western Front &quot; : &quot; The 1914 spirit (not so deeply hidden as might have been thought) was allowed to flare up for an unguarded moment. It Avas quickly shut away again, but the brief betrayal of this spirit in unexpected quarters was impressive-and not easily to be forgotten.&quot; Whatever criticism we may make of French post-war policy, we must never forget that, if Germany had won the war, there would have been no discussion as to who did win it. We desire German recovery not from any sympathy, but merely from an enlightened self-interest, and then presumably only up to a certain point.8. As for Russia, she has temporarily put some water into her wine. That is merely because &quot;the devil was sick &quot; or somewhat indisposed. With a heavy adverse balance of trade, she is anxious about her own position. By the irony of things it has begun to appear that the Communist experiment can only function in an environment of prosperous capitalism. She is in no mood for adventure, and has become engaged upon pacts of non-aggression with the French bloc. It is the mood of the moment, and will not, therefore, still the apprehensions of the border States, of whom we need say no more in this paper than that they may well remain shy in the matter of disarmament. The Japanese, however, gauged well and took advantage of this mood, when they chose the moment to break loose in Manchuria, by which action they have also demonstrated their opinion of the present state of the United States of America. It is perhaps still more significant to our purpose that, outside League of Nations Union circles, the bulk of &quot;civilised&quot; opinion and the uncivilised are untroubled by opinions- was with Japan. &quot; The Chinese had been asking for trouble, and had got it.&quot; Japan has indeed caused the Old Adam including even his milder incarnations, such as the anti-League Beaverbrook press to rub his hands with Schadenfreude.   &quot;During the twelvemonth elapsed between the 1929 and 1930Assemblies, the League had a lean period.....To an observer it seems almosta pity that something new and heavy and soluble cannot devise and present itself.&quot; (An Aspect of International Relations in 1931.) Something new and heavy has presented itself, and proved insoluble. Geneva has suffered a severe set-back. The Old Adam confidently anticipates a fresh, and perhaps a final, one at the Disarmament Conference. The signs up to date bear him out. Even in quarters where failure is not desired, there is an almost universal glib and glum assumption that nothing real or tangible will come of it, that the obstacles are too great to be surmounted, the tangles too intricate to unravel. Europe has drifted to the eve, with little more than a fading hope that somehow &quot;it will be all right on the night.&quot;-[6393] b 2
9. It will none the less be possible for us to help to overcome this spirit if Europe is willing. We must first, however, discover and understand the main sources of this spirit. The authors of the Foreign Office memorandum CP. 301 (31) of the 26th November have traced the concatenation of our common troubles as follows : Monetary crisis economic chaos reparations and war debts disarmament security territorial status quo of Europe revision of the peace settlement. That last, indeed, is what il^all ultimately comes back to, and I would refer again to my memorandum of the beginning of the year. We might, indeed, if we were unlucky, have the problem (of treaty revision) thrown upon the Council table of the Disarmament Conference before we had exjDected it.&quot;10. Of the peace settlements &quot; we cannot afford to be too critical, since we took such share of the spoil as suited us; but we must recognise that the democracies of 1919, with the moderation of the oligarchs of 1814 and 1815 before their eyes, failed to follow it; and their high unwisdom not that any good settlement was possible has been with us unto this day. One &quot; settlement,&quot; indeed the Turkish was so wild that it broke down at once; but the others have remained, are at the root of everything, and are probably still untouchable, since the principal beneficiary has recently declared that she would prefer war to change. There is, indeed, little ground for a supposition that any country would do what we did after the Boer War, or that our slow species has suddenly grown up between 1919 and 1932; strong elements in Europe are restrained from violence metu non moribus, and the caution of a scalded generation is a wasting asset.11. Now &quot;the British position in relation to European policy&quot; is that, apart from the initial mistakes now branded in the United States we have been prodigal of amends by good advice and unappreciated good example, by advocating the cancellation of war debts and reparations, by the remission of so much that was due to us, by the undertakings we have signed, and by the great eommitment of Locarno, undertaken to allay qualms that are not ours. We have taken, amid passions, dispassionate views, and have waited as we waited far longer in the case of free trade long and in vain for the rest of the world to follow a lead in sense. We may recall our pathetic and innocent attempts during these last years to batter down tariff walls without a stick. The moral is again one that the Old Adam draws with pleasure.12. It should, moreover if parenthetically be mentioned that, in. the course of our endeavours, we have been careful to cultivate Anglo-American relations to a degree of cordiality never before attained. We are in the United States the most popular member of Europe; and this position we must strive to maintain, with a full knowledge of American limitations. For when we come to deeds, not words, collaboration with Washington so long next door to a fool&apos;s paradise has on the whole proved little easier than with the Quai d&apos;Orsay. Full credit must be given for &quot; the Hoover year &quot; ; but the. United States have often let us down, especially when we were in opposition to France, to whom they actually gave us away this summer when we were trying to support them. Mr. Floover has been a failure, and there is now at the Capitol every sign of a xeturn to the larger lunacy.13. In return for these efforts we have suffered proportionately more than anyone else from all the nationalisms, and particularly the economic nationalism, let loose by the war and its aftermath. Our people have a far greater under-standing of, and interest in, &quot;European policy &quot; than before the war, for the simple reason that foreign and domestic policy and events are now so intimately connected. Moreover &quot; from being the most insular we have evolved, into the most, indeed into the only, international mind among our contemporaries, if we except the happy and detached Scandinavians.&quot; (&quot;An Aspect-of International Relations in 1930.&quot;) Most of us know something about &quot;European policy&quot; nowadays, and many there be that, for good reason, don&apos;t like it, thinking as Mr. Galsworthy&apos;s grocer spoke. France and the United States of America between them have at times made our pro-French and pro-American feelings seem almost like sentimentalism. Yet I do not think that this country is, strictly speaking, anti-French, though such enthusiasm as the relatively modern departure of the French connexion excited has now almost entirely vanished. (The converse is largely true in France.) The position is rather that France, having been necessarily more to the fore, has necessarily come in
for a greater share of the odium and recrimination, which a pitiable world has engendered and lavished. It must be admitted, moreover, that French policy has been at many points contrary to our interests; and to this we must add a sneaking but undeniable sympathy for Germany, bred of the equally undeniable spirit of contradiction so strong in our race. For the rest, there is now probably more political and economic gunpowder lying about than in 1914, and existing sparks are fanned by more highly-developed propaganda, and a generally bad and more widely-read press. As is noted in &quot; The Anatomy of Melancholy,&quot; &quot; the devil might be quiet if the witches did not twist his tail.&quot; The tariff hostilities of a much-divided continent need no history here : on the political side there are the prickly problems of Silesia, the Polish Corridor, Russia and the border States, Bessarabia, Vilna, Transylvania, the Ffabsburg question from which we should do well to extricate ourselves Franco-Italian rivalry in the Balkans, Italy and Yugoslavia, Yugo-slavia and Bulgaria, Italy and Albania, leading again to Italy and Yugoslavia and so back to Italy and France. The truth is that real disarmament is hardly attainable without moral disarmament, which means treaty revision. The latter form of disarmament would render the former far less urgent. We are morally disarmed. No one else is, though a tribute must be paid to the recent efforts and effects of M. Veniselos in his smaller sphere.  The rest of Europe is in a bad way.14. On such chaos this country is aware of having made singularly little impression. What it does not know so clearly is the extent of our present weak-ness, and the fact that our failure to impress the Old Adam has been largely due to our progressive and visible loss of physical weight. We were in slow process of being written off as an active force, and. owing to our internal difficulties and policies, were reckoned weaker than was good for the world. In our anxiety to give a healthy lead we have bled ourselves financially, and banted militarily, in a degree which, if- continued unilaterally the respective figures of military expenditure are given in the footnote to p. 1 of the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum of the 12th December might, as I pointed out in 1930, eventually lead to the pacemaker being mistaken for the quarry. This, from the political angle, is an anticipation and confirmation of the Chiefs of Staff present view that further reduction on our part is hardly compatible with safety, unless others first come down more nearly to our level; and the implication of resolution 2 of the Three Party Committee seems to be the same.15. The foregoing is a short, but I hope sufficient, account of &quot; the British-position, in relation to European policy,&quot; and it brings us to the specific question of disarmament. Of the vast material available a niinimum has been selected as bearing directly upon the problem, which is dealt with in the succeeding para-graphs. It will be seen that both the general and the particular question bristle with difficulties. The prospect is not hopeful, but it is not so hopeless as is now frequently assumed, and much will, as usual, depend on the manner in which we play our peculiarly delicate part. The occasion is a vitally important one. &apos;&apos; The League must have successfully solved at least one major problem of readjustment before we can reasonably express conviction that dissatisfied nations have really renounced war as an instrument of national policy.&quot; (Memorandum of the 25th June.) The Manchurian chance has come and gone. Another failure might prove fatal, even if Germany does not fulfil her threat of quitting. This we must desire to prevent for our own sakes as well as for that of the League. So far as firm ground can be left for the realms of prophecy, we are like to have more eventual trouble with Russia than with any other country. We can be no party to pushing Germany into Russian arms, which were escaped by Locarno and her entry into the League, and into which Georges Dandin seems again to have &apos;&apos; voulu &apos;&apos; to press her.16. But if it is vital to avoid complete failure, complete success is, of -course, in no case possible. What we have now to consider at short notice is how, without too much cost to ourselves, to secure at best a partial and temporary solution, and at worst the credit for constructive suggestion. The latter is essential for reasons not only of international but of internal policy. Conversely, in the event of failure we must avoid being saddled with any of the responsibility Which it will be sought to cast upon us. There would be a hunt for scapegoats, and we are a likely one, if we do not play with skill and effect such cards as we
can muster. Those cards must, moreover, be played as a hand. &quot;We cannot afford to fritter away our few trumps by attempting isolated bargains. We should rather, at the psychological moment, come out with a comprehensive offer-involving comprehensive pressure, as described later. This involves &quot;shock&quot; tactics and the element of surprise. The other desideratum may be mentioned at once. One reason for our loss of weight since 1926 has been that &quot;the foreigner &apos; one must be insular for a minute has been secretly anticipating the gradual dissolution of the Empire, and some of the Commonwealth delegations have at times not exactly discouraged the idea. It is therefore essential that this hand should be played with the greatest possible measure of unity among the Commonwealth representatives.17. So far as is possible, moreover, the hand should be played for time; and, when that is no longer possible or expedient, we should have shock tactics at our disposal. The French elections in May cannot weaken it, and, indeed, will most conceivably strengthen it. Eeason the less, on this and another strong ground, for showing our hand in advance, still less half the hand. I should certainly deprecate &quot;laying all our cards on the table&quot; in advance with the French. We have not enough aces for that. The other ground is to change the metaphor that our gift horse, to be described below, is going to be very critically and grudgingly examined in the mouth. The longer the time for examination, the greater will be the opportunity for carping. Our horse cannot be a &quot;classic &quot; winner, but he can be a very useful performer in the big spring handicap. Given time he will be crabbed down to fitness only for the Belgian knacker.18. These reasons tend to confirm the doubt, expressed in the first paragraph of this memorandum, &quot;whether the publication in advance of any document will not seriously disserve our cause and purpose.&quot; It also leads me to doubt the wisdom of the idea, which has, I understand, been put forward in some quarters, that we should &apos;&apos; sound &apos;&apos; the French, and possibly the Germans, in advance. Little good has hitherto come of sounding the French about these matters. We have been &quot;sounding&quot; them for two years in regard to naval limitation, and they have been tinkling brass to us, and sounding cymbals in their press and Chamber. I am, besides, rather suspicious of the meaning of that verb; it is so often mere diplomatic jargon for giving something or oneself  away. The French can tell us nothing new; the Quai d&apos;Orsay adopted the full thesis of the French General Staff in their July memorandum. We know perfectly well what they mean by &quot;security.&quot; They mean security for their satellites, since they are themselves secured against defeat by the Locarno Agreement; and that security we cannot and will not give them [vide conclusion 1 of the Cabinet meeting of the 15th December). We should thus only produce a dead-end at once. In a memorandum of the 21st September I ventured to suggest that our offers, if approved, &quot;should not be made until the Disarmament Conference has actually met,&quot; and I remain of that opinion.19. If. then, we are to come into the conference with a clear programme in our own minds, but with our hand free to be best played as circumstances permit or dictate, it behoves us to think out in advance the course of those circumstances as we would have them be. The most advantageous course would seem to be that already envisaged by the Cabinet in conclusion (d) of its meeting of the 15th December, &quot;that the Disarmament Conference should be opened with a series of speeches designed to give an uplift to the cause of disarmament, without raising contentious or provocative issues, and thus to create a favourable atmosphere throughout the world, in which the conference could continue its work in detail. This first stage should, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be followed immediately by committees.&quot; It is unlikely that this will please the Germans, who will say that this committee-game has been going on for years; but, in their own interest, which is after all the greatest, we should exercise our powers of suasion to secure adherence to this procedure.20. It is presumably at this stage that we should also &quot; take the oppor-tunity to emphasise the extent to which we ourselves have already disarmed.&apos;-&apos; It is incontestable that we have disarmed to an almost dangerous degree; but such a declaration on our part will not &quot;go over big.&quot; It will only produce declarations of equal, though less well-founded, virtue from many a peccantSome may even think that we should thereby be bordering on &apos;&apos; contentious or
provocative issues.&quot; That, however, can well be avoided; and I have no doubt that we should make such a declaration, having ah eye to politics both at home and abroad, and also to the conclusion to be proposed in the later stage of the conference and this paper. We can be frank and conciliatory without being &quot; superior.&quot;21. So much for the first stage. But we have some reason to think that the French are probably going to endeavour to take the lead at the start, and to hold the field for their thesis. We must be prepared for this, since we must secure a lead for the play of our hand, and not merely follow suit. On the extent, therefore, to which the French force the pace must depend the date for the production of our programme. It should, however, if possible, be held till after May.22. This brings us to the conflict between the French and German theses, and on the attitude to be adopted by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the certain event of its demonstration. We are all agreed that everything should be done to&apos; avoid the immediate outbreak of the antithesis. (In this connexion, I would discard right away Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s idea of raising, or dwelling upon, the security of Germany. An early clash with France would be ensured by such tactics, which are irreconcilable with the sheep and goat theory.) We may, on the other hand, reasonably hope to avoid such a clash by early conversations at the conference not before since the earlier we begin these conversations the earlier we shall have to show our hand; and I would venture to repeat that we should play it for time.23. To the French we should point out, as suggested by Sir M. Hankey, &quot; the dangers that will arise to the peace of the world if Germany is doomed to extremes .... and urge that, in their own interest, they should try to make a sufficient concession to enable the German Government to persuade their people that a first step had been taken to carry out the implications of article 8 of the Covenant.&quot; (As a matter of fact we have considerable ground for believing that the Germans are well aware they can only expect an instalment at this stage, and would be prepared to accept a reasonable one. At one point this summer, for instance, they indicated that they would want a licence for the same weapons as other people, but would be satisfied with a licence for very few.) &quot; In urging this, we could fairly point out to the French that their military strength, especially when considered in conjunction with their political treaties, is such as to give them a large margin of safety, and that concessions could be made without endangering their security.&quot; We most certainly could, and should, do so; our Chiefs of Staff have pronounced the French to be over-insured, and, indeed, they are. We should also refer to Locarno, but chiefly to point out that it has never been properly appreciated by&quot; the French public, because it has never been properly explained to them. And our new offers will share this fate if we are ill-advised enough to make them in secret.24. To the Germans we could certainly urge, as suggested by Sir M. Hankey, that &quot;the Reparations Conference had been undertaken for one reason only, namely, to try to assist German)^ in her difficulties.&quot; And, presumably, that the Disarmament Conference had, by the nature of &quot;things, something at least of the same character. In these circumstances, &apos;&apos; the utmost they can hope for is some concession from France, which the German Government can repre-sent to their people as a first step in the solution of a long-range problem.....(This, as indicated above, they fully understand.)   &apos;&apos; We should point out thegreat risks to them which precipitate action on their part will involve.....Weshould indicate that we are doing our utmost to try to induce the French to go as far as they can reasonably be expected to go to meet the German point of view.&quot; On the other hand, I do not agree with Sir M. Hankey&apos;s suggestion that &apos; we should rub into them the difficulties they themselves have created by failure to say &quot;thank you&quot; for the evacuation of the Rhineland. (I have seen in the French press, during the last three months, plenty of references to their own financial generosity to us, but not one single reference to our tenfold greater financial generosity to them. Ingratitude is a bad habit, but not a sin, in inter-national politics.) Nor do I agree that they should be upbraided with Stahlhelm meetings; no German Government is strong enough to prevent them, and every
, ,  S-&apos;    .German Government relies on the Stahlhelm to help in coping with the Communists at a crisis. Nor with the customs union; our representative at The Hague approved it, and no one in this country thought it detrimental to our interest, except in so far as it frightened the French. All that is over for the present; let it lie. Nor, and least of all, with the pocket battleship. Germany is entirely within her rights; she has, moreover, been positively driven into pocket battleships (and civil aviation) by the Treaty of Versailles. I myself thought she would have been wise to make a concession on the point this summer; but since France ran out of the Bases of Agreement, and has shown clear signs of throwing exaggerated tonnage into the very categories the light ones where toe particularly do not want them, if only Germany can be pressed into not building Deutschlands, it is, until France becomes reasonable, in our own interest that Germany should keep a free hand on this score. We at least are not afraid of them, whereas &quot; France has been building up a modern fleet at a rate which appears quite unnecessary, and which will, if continued, shortly constitute such a potential threat to the British Commonwealth as to necessitate counter-measures &quot; (Chiefs of Staff memorandum of the 24th September).25. It may be urged that we should be prepared for the next step, should these suasions prove unavailing to prevent premature loggerheads. Here we may, perhaps, return to some considerations advanced in the earlier &quot;portion of this paper.28. It is clear that the French thesis is a very bad one, and leads nowhere. Were they to stand pat on it, the conference would be bound for complete failure, and therewith perhaps the disintegration of the League and of Europe. It is clear, moreover, that their thesis is incompatible with our interests, particularly in regard to their Air Force, whose metropolitan strength is thrice that of ours, and on the naval side already aptly characterised by the Chiefs of Staff.27. It is equally clear that the German case is a very good one. For the purposes of this paper, and of our&apos;policy, a present may be made to the French of the juridical view so well expounded in Mr. Beckett&apos;s memorandum, reprinted as an appendix to the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum of the 12th December. The fact remains that the German case is on every ground of morality and &apos; equity exceedingly strong, as is recognised by the Cabinet under conclusion (b) (IV) of their meeting of the 15th December. On these grounds the case is, indeed, almost unanswerable and it happens largely to coincide with our interests. We desire disarmament or the end of over-armament and we do not desire a perpetual hegemony. This is recognised not only by the Cabinet, but by an overwhelming majority in the public opinion of this country. It has been already pointed out that public opinion inclines far more toward Germany than toward France in this as in other matters, and why this is so. More than this, the Dominions are also of this opinion. As shown above, the Dominions and this country are right, and, also as shown above, it is impossible or at least highly inexpedient for us to separate ourselves from, or to go against, the Dominions at this crisis. There is much to be said in logic for the French theory of an immediate ubiquitous and effective international police. There would be still more to be saidwere not France already over-insured. But she is; and, in an imperfect and highly intricate world, we are not dealing in logic. See how it has put the obsession of &quot; two years &quot; into the French mind on reparations !28. If, then, it comes to a show-down between the two conflicting theses, neither international policy, nor Imperial policy, nor domestic policy will permit any British Government to side with the French against the Germans. Domestic polic)r, in particular, is an argument that appeals to French politicians, and in case of extreme need it will have to be added, in tactful form, to the suasions enumerated in paragraph 24. A friend&apos;s regretful hint in this direction may disincline the French publicly to court the isolation, of which they are already well aware and apprehensive as regards feeling in Italy and the United States. Nor will the French be surprised by such a move. The French know that the thesis of His Majesty&apos;s Government has always approximated more closely to that of Germany than to that of France. The French will have little, interest to appear as the scapegoat in provoking a crisis; indeed, they are less likely to do so than the Germans, who have the better ease and nothing to lose.
Adjustment must, indeed, take place by degrees, but there must be some adjust-ment, and some immediate adjustment; and we need by no means despair of bringing the French to realise this.29. The foregoing paragraphs (22-28) might be held to be the answers to question 1 in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum of the 12th December. But we desire to avoid a show-down with France, both for our own sakes and that of the conference and therefore of the League -which it would imperil. We must therefore desire to couple, or rather to follow, this intimation with another more agreeable to them. And so soon as we are forced into this position by any forcing of the pace, will be the moment to begin the play of our full hand, not privately but with the utmost possible publicity. &quot;It is most important for us to avoid committing ourselves on one side or the other &quot; (Cabinet meeting of the 15th December). If we were faced with a choice we should have to support the German case. But there is no reason why we should be faced with such a choice, and there is ample room for manoeuvring to avoid it.30. It is plain that we cannot go the whole way with the thesis of the Quai d&apos; Or say, but we can go some way with them. This will not be far enough to suit the French General Staff. Therefore inducement must ;be supplemented by pressure, and at the conclusion of this memorandum means are suggested whereby uninvidious pressure might be applied to France, if her fears are not only genuine but widespread. This is another reason for which our hand must be played in public.31. It may be convenient at this stage to clear the ground by a series of other &quot; cannots &quot;&apos; in regard to suggestions which have emerged from the voluminous literature on this question : (a) We cannot, in the view of any of our experts, agree to the constitution of a League army, a League navy, or a League air force (see second sentence of paragraph 106, Report of the Interdepartmental Sub-Committee of Imperial Defence on preparation for the Disarmament Conference, R.A.I. 16, of the 27th November). The French are well aware of this, but we know that they are likely to throw these proposals successively on the table, rather, perhaps, withdraw. Johnson&apos;s idea that behind the expression of most opinion lies the desire &apos;&quot;&apos; to-vex someone.&quot; In regard, however, to the.matter of an international air force, I venture to suggest a tentative reservation. We should not be put at the outset into a posture of mere negation. If, indeed, the French play this gambit, would it not be possible for us to consider it by replying as follows? We should be not unwilling to consider the proposal for a part at least of our air force, but on conditions. These would be that the suggestion were coupled with a previous under-taking on the part of France and Italy and, of course, also of the United States and Russia that, in the event of acceptance, they would immediately come down to our level in aircraft, or even lower  when we would follow suit provided a sufficient margin were left for oriental police purposes. Either we should hear no more of the matter,-and should have scored a point for purposes of example and publicity, or less probably -the point would be taken, and we, now fifth Power only in the air, should at a stroke have secured an enormous reduction in a dangerous arm of dangerous neighbours. If this suggestion were accepted, it might go into the pool of conditional assets. In any case, this paragraph contains the answer to question 4r in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum of the 12th December.(&amp;) We cannot agree to the internationalisation of civil aircraft. The arguments of the Air Ministry, and, indeed, of common sense, appear overwhelming on this point, attractive though the idea may have appeared when not too closely examined. De loin c&apos;est quelque chose, et de pres ce n&apos;est rien.(c) We cannot agree to the outlawry of aircraft in war, unless employed against an aggressor under the authority of the League of Nations. Such a provision could not of course be relied upon, and the proposal[6393] c
is unacceptable if for no other reason than our secret knowledge of what is already going on in regard to poison gas.(d) We cannot put forward any proposal for the limitation of tanks and heavy guns, &quot; though we might accept a suitable and practicable proposal if put forward by others&quot; (paragraph 99 of E.A.I. 16). This attitude would therefore also go into the pool of conditional assets.(e) We cannot agree to abolish military aviation, because, unlike othercountries, we are never likely to have much, or sufficient, civil aviation. Paragraph 105 of R.A.I. 16 seems conclusive on this point. (/) We cannot, I venture to think, agree to disclosure of reserves of material (R.A.I. 16, paragraph 119). The only real argument in favour of disclosure of our nakedness is that it would be &quot;a valuable earnest of our pacific intentions.&quot; Now all, or most of, the nations of Europe fear, or profess to fear, that one will make war on another. Nobody but an occasional Soviet scribe with invocations of Sir Ff. Deterding and Aircraftsman Shaw even, or ever, professes to fear that of us. The argument of &quot; pacific intentions &quot; is thereby invalidated, and therewith the case for disclosure.The ground being thus cleared of &quot; cannots,&quot; we may return to the argument where we left it at the end of paragraph 30. What can we accept or contribute ? The answer to this will be the answer to the Secretary of State&apos;s questions 2 and 3.32. The answer is a good deal. In my memorandum of the 21st September, which is based oh a minute of the preceding winter, I ventured to point out that, however little we might like it and however unreasonable we might consider it, the Disarmament Coi/ference was almost certain to end in failure., if we were not prepared to make a further contribution. The authors of Foreign Office memorandum, CP. 301 (31). even envisage the acceptance on conditions of the entire protocol of 1924 rather than the certain disaster of present drift. We have, as a matter of fact, vowing we would never consent, consented to a great part of the protocol (Locarno, Pact of Paris, Optional Clause/ General Act and proposed amendments to the Covenant, and, possibly, the Treaty for Strengthening the Means of Preventing War). This is well set forth in pp. 14 and 15 of Mr. Cadogan&apos;s &quot;Historical Review of the Obligations of Great Britain in the matter of &apos; Security &apos; &quot; of the 18th March. In any case, &quot;the whole hog &quot; of the protocol is ruled out, and wisely, by the Cabinet&apos;s conclusion (&amp;) (1) of the 15th December.33. Without, therefore, going as far as the authors of CP. 301 (31), I had already gone some distance with them without unduly increasing the already existing foreign commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government. My September proposals were as follows :  (a) &apos;&apos; We might offer to the French to consolidate in the Covenant, or at least in one single instrument, all the commitments which we have already undertaken, and all those which we have declared ourselves ready to undertake. That would present to the world a formidable document bearing a very strong resemblance to the protocol, and having there-fore some value in the eyes of a public already over-insured.(b) &quot; My second suggestion is that His Majesty&apos;s Government should declare that they will never consider treaty revision, except within the frame-work of the League of Nations, i.c, by the peaceful means to which all nations are already and repeatedly pledged. This is of special concern to France, owing to her close relations with Eastern European States. The declaration would, of course, have to be carefully drafted, and would bring in a reference to article 19 of the Covenant, so as to restrain and soothe Germany, who attaches special importance to that article.obligations under the Covenant, and the other instruments by which
they are bound, should the need arise. This does not commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to any further interpretation of their obligations under article 16 of the Covenant, but at any rate it shows France that in all reasonable cases they could rely upon our support.&quot; I am, of course, aware of the difficulties of a blockade, which fully emerged at the time of the Manchurian incident, and also of the American complications, but these must both be faced; and I do not believe that in practice we should&apos; since the Pact of Paris have any real difficulty with the United States in the case of a real aggressor. (d) &apos;&apos; It might also be considered whether it would not be desirable to make a further declaration which would confirm an already existing obligation under the Treaty of Locarno, that, in the event of that treaty coming into operation, the British Navy would protect the northern ports of France. This would also require very careful drafting, and it is possible that public opinion would consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government were thereby undertaking some fresh obligation. A glance at the Treaty of Locarno will show that this is not the case, and since doubts have been expressed in France whethei-the British Navy could be counted upon to protect their northern ports in the event of the Treaty of Locarno coming into play &quot; (see remark under paragraph 23 above), &quot; a solemn affirmation of the obvious might be acceptable as a makeweight for the abandonment in part of the present French policy towards disarmament.&quot;34. The foregoing will not now be sufficient to move the French, or at any rate to move them far enough. Our list of inducements is not, however, exhausted, and here we come to the answer to the Secretary of State&apos;s Question 3. The Cabinet, in (b) (iii) of the 15th December, concluded that, &quot; as regards^ji Mediterranean Locarno, the general idea is worth exploring, but opinion was reserved on the &apos;question of&quot; acce^Fmgany&quot;commitmeiit.. In any event, however, the commitment would have to Jbe safeguarded by provision for arbitration as an essential stage before it could take effect.&quot; Since then a very represeiuTative sub-committee has examined theVraestion, and reported against it (C.D.C. (sub) 31.3). It is, therefore, with diffidence that I offer a view in the contrary sense; but, in view of the crucial nature of the decision to be taken, I do so all the same.35. It seems to me, then, that the committee have looked at the matter from somewhat too technical angles, and not all round, that is, in the light of the general political situation and consequences: for there can be little doubt that, if we all stand pat, the conference is going to fail with incalculable results. For an even partial success it is necessary for us to take some chance somewhere. The question is, how best to limit those chances, while obtaining the maximum result. But the committee begin by assuming that we cannot get a price for the commitment, even if taken. Why? Is not that starting beaten? Why should we not rather be in a position to win either way? If we ask a sufficiently high price and we can ask what price we like we are &quot;on velvet.&quot; For either we shall get what we want to our own satisfaction and astonishment; or we shall get not the price, but the credit for a constructive, if abortive, offer. &quot; On the assumption,&quot; say the committee, &quot; that France might be willing to reduce up to a maximum of 5-7 divisions, it will be seen that the commitments we should be asked to undertake would not procure anything at all comparable by way of reductions in return.&quot; But why assume a maximum of 5-7 divisions? We are entitled on demonstrable grounds to ask a b igh price for a fresh commitment, to which our contribution might be the highest, while our interest was perhaps the lowest, or even only an indirect one. I would certainly ask for far more than &quot;5-7 divisions&quot; on land; for two or three times that amount if our experts thought it the right return, or for whatever our experts did think to be the right return. And, in any case, I would insist besides on an immediate reduction of French submarines to our own figure. (Italian and Yugoslav submarines would, of course, be restricted, too; the latter may become a danger if they are built in French yards and kept at French call.) France has 56,042 tons of cruiser-submarines, which are unsuitable for coast defence. It is in our highest interest to get rid of these. And by what other means ? The alternative (see paragraph 4 Wle-w) is largely to increase our destroyer tonnage, which neither0 [6393]atr5rvv d
financially nor electorally can we well afford. It has been decided that we are to press again for the abolition of submarines. Agreed. But we know that we shall not succeed because, while we call them weapons of offence agreed again almost all other Powers dub them weapons of defence. But, in the next breath, our experts, plus a sub-commission of the League, turn round and &apos;&quot; have definitely stated &quot; that no distinction can be drawn between offensive and defensive armaments. Nobody so far seems to have taken up this contradiction, but somebody at Geneva is surely bound to do so, if we press our case beyond a formal gesture.   In other words, we are, at our own showing, on weak ground.36. Again, the committee have expended criticism upon the French draft put forward at the Naval Conference of 1930, because it is the sole model in existence. But why should it be ? If we are to put a price to a commitment, we can prepare and put in our own document, and so keep a controlling hand on the commitment. Time and space prevent me from here enlarging upon this theme; but surely the stakes being what they are the idea, and therewith a powerful lever, should not be discarded until we have at least tried our hand at this. And if so, can it not be well provided that the commitment would only come into play on the unanimous finding of the Council of the League; in which case ive shall have to satisfy ourselves before action is involved. We shall have lost our cunning indeed if we cannot conceive and lay down a document, which will not necessarily bring us into action on sea and in the air, if the Greeks and Turks should set about each other.37. The committee add that the suggestion of a Mediterranean Locarno can have &quot; no particular attraction for the majority of the Dominions,&quot; and go on &quot; to consider the disadvantages of again undertaking commitments without them.&quot; I need hardly say that I concur in their paragraph 18, for I had already stressed the need of Empire unity in paragraphs 16 and 27 above. It may be that, as the committee say, in paragraph 19, the Dominions would consider that there is no, &quot;satisfactory quid pro quo&quot; for them in such a deal. But is that really so? Nobody, especially young people, get out of having a future; and the effects of failure are not going to be confined to Europe and the League. There is some interest for everyone in preventing the destruction of civilisation; indeed, it is hard to conceive a greater one. If we are all going to take the narrow view foreshadowed by the committee, there is indeed little hope; and the less we say about the French the better. Is it not again &quot; starting beaten &quot; to assume that the Dominions will be blind or deaf, before we have even tried our hand at consultation and explanation? And even if the Dominions remain obdurate so far as they themselves are concerned, can we not follow the Locarno precedent ? New Zealand had then ironically enough to be restrained, in the name of Imperial unity, from following us ! And the &quot; final and unanimous conclusion &apos;&apos; of the Imperial Conference of 1926 was : &quot; The conference has heard with satisfaction the statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with regard to the effort made to ensure peace in Europe, culminating in the agreements of Locarno; and congratulates His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain on its share in this successful contribution towards the promotion of the peace of the world.&quot; Locarno is unpopular in this country wdien it is not comfortably forgotten. But it is done, and wisely done; the only thing that was unwise was that we got no price for it. We should get a double price now. WhoA-then is there to hinder, at worst, a like procedure after prior consultation ? I would beg the Cabinet, in spite of the impressive composition of the sub-committee, to reflect again upon the political implications of this suggestion, before they reject it. The result of breaking no eggs is admittedly not an omelette, but it may well be a mess.38.   I therefore return from this digression to the series of &quot; inducements &quot;; and venture, provisionally at least, to include in it (e) A Mediterranean Locarno, subject (1) to the safeguards prescribed by the Cabinet; (2) to the conditions described in paragraph 34; (3) to the safeguards suggested in paragraph 36; (4) to prior consultation and, if possible, agreement-with the Dominions.39. Even so, the insatiable French appetite for &quot;security&quot; may not be satisfied. She will still be thinking chiefly of the Poles, secondarily of the. Yugoslavs and Czechs, and perhaps &quot; a little, much, and not at all &quot; of the poorj
and decrepit Roumanians. She may still hanker for the whole body of salvation in the protocol. For that, if we have gone as far as suggested above under (a)-(e) (but (e) is the essential part), a very reasonable move is available. Let there be, if there must be, a European continental protocol. We will be members of it, but only, so to speak, country members, or members resident abroad, and therefore on a reduced subscription. We should abide by all our obligations enumerated under paragraph 32, plus the amended Covenant, of course (conveniently summarised on p. 12 of Mr. Cadogan&apos;s memorandum), plus the Treaty of Financial Assistance, plus points (a) to (e). We should naturally refrain from any help or comfort to the aggressor; and there might be some hope that we might shame or lug the United States into such a declaration also, although the year 1932 is a bad one for American virility, being one of the two and a half out of every four when the approach, passage and recovery from presidential elections render them completely impotent. Let those, then, who desire a continental protocol have it with our blessing; and we will pay a high, but not a full, subscription. To this subscription and membership I will refer again under the pressure to be described at the conclusion of this memorandum. This is point (/) in our programme. But we have not yet finished our inducements to the French, and there are yet two to come.40. (g) Germany, for her part, will have to sign the General Act. This she has not only not hitherto done, but has shown a strong aversion from doing.41. (h) Germany will have to sign the draft declaration, or multilateral political truce, of which a copy is appended as annexe. This I drafted last summer and it may, of course, need some or considerable modification in the hope of leading the Germans up to the mildest possible form of a French desideratum, which might have promoted a flow of reconciliation and of money. It was put in a multilateral form in order to make matters as easy as possible for the Briining Government, which was then, as now, in a precarious condition. The Germans were nervous, and shied off the whole subject. We did not press the matter beyond that; and pressure would also have been necessary upon the French, to induce them to accept so gentle a document. It might have had an effect then; it will probably do so now; in any case, it will have to be embodied among our inducements, and forced along if necessary.42. It may be said that Germany will shy again at these two points. That is likely, but there must be, and will be, inducements and attractions for Germany as well as for France. To these France must be brought to agree. Some can be suggested here; some she may be able to suggest for herself.43. (i) There should be onejstandard for the limitation of navies throughout the world; and we are prepareoTto abrogate the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles (R.A.I. 16, paragraph 94) ana to bring the German navy on to the same category basis as provided in the Washington and London Naval Treaties. There is considerable inducement to Germany in this; firstly, the abrogation of part of the Treaty of Versailles, and, secondly, the basis of equality, for which she is always clamant. On the other hand, there is some inducement 1o France, too. She &quot;is always squealing about Deutschlands, and, as already pointed out, Germany has been driven into Deutschlands by the Treaty of Versailles.44. (ii) We might adopt a suggestion, made by our experts, for a time limit for the disarmament clauses of the Peace Treaty. France will jib at this, but even she cannot expect them to operate even, in theory for all time.. They are, indeed, already failing to operate; there is a series of infractions, of which we are aware, but not interested to note. These infractions will merely and gradually increase, provided that Germany is wise enough to avoid an explosion at Geneva or at home. Time is on her side here, if she will let it be. The French may as well cease to blink it, and get the credit for a graceful but moderate gesture, when the alternative is to have at least as much, and probably more, filched, with a thumbed nose at their back.45. (iii) The Germans will have to have some equality in principle of treatment, though not in quantity.   We cannot abolish military aviation (vide supra):   They will, therefore, have to have some military aviation; we cannot indefinitely confine them to civil aviation, into which they have been driven. r6393&quot;! d 2
They will secure this anyway. The concession may as well be courageously made, and limited, temporarily and nominally, though the Germans might conceivably even keep faith for a while. The same applies to tanks and heavy guns, unless some medicine-man can produce the miracle of the &quot;suitable and practicable proposal&quot; already mentioned, but not expected. Here, again, the Germans might, probably would, be content with a moderate instalment, and the way for this might be prepared in the private conversations already suggested at Geneva.46. (iv) We come at last to the most difficult, and hitherto rather hopeless, question of conscription. Here I would draw particular attention to the valuable paragraphs (109-16) in R.A.1.16. I would begin by saying that the argument in favour of conscription described in paragraph 115 would not seem to have much value; and that there is some force in the suggestion of paragraph 116 that the reopening of discussions on this contentious subject &quot;may lead to some bitterness of feeling, and may also impair such agreement as has already been reached with so much labour in the draft Disarmament Convention.&quot; I venture, however, to suggest with some diffidence that there might be a way round this. In para-graph 112 the experts, recognising that we are unlikely to get agreement on the question of limiting the numbers of the annual contingents, make three suggestions for limiting their efficiency, both while with the colours and while in the reserves. These are (a) to reduce the periods of service to a level such as prevails in the Swiss army; (b) to prevent a compensating increase of long-service personnel by limitation of the number of such personnel; (c) to reduce the number of officers and reserve officers. Now these suggestions are unlikely, as pointed out, to be generally palatable; they would be, as they stand, particularly unpalatable to France. Would not a solution be possible, or at least worth putting forward, on the following lines ? Proposal (a) would be cast rather into this form, that compulsory military service should be permissible for Germany at a date to be determined, which would be identical with that fixed under paragraph 44. The delay would be something at least on the French side, especially if it were coupled with these additional provisions. It would, as under (a), be conditional on all European countries giving to their conscripts only such training as is undergone by the Swiss a short period in the first year, and a matter of da)rs thereafter. (I have not the exact periods by me here.) Moreover, for the countries with smaller populations, there would be compensa-tion in the size of the standing army. Thus, by way merely of illustration, if Germany had a conscript army on the Swiss model, plus a standing army of, say, 50,1)00, France, with her smaller population, would be entitled to a standing army of 150,000. Italy, having rather a larger population, would get rather less. (Such figures would incidentally suit our own pretty well.) There would be a corresponding compensation for a superiority in military aircraft, on the assumption that the larger population would have a superiority in civil aviation. But there would be a still further allowance for colonial armies; and Germany lias no colonies. France would, therefore, get a double margin of superiority, which would still work out at an imposing figure; while Germany also would get a pleasing concession. On the other hand, the model of the Swiss army has been so much praised in the most peaceful circles, that an imitation of it could not be represented in any circles as a return to militarism. All this may, perhaps, sound, over-ingenious, but I submit that we are in straits where it is everybody&apos;s duty to exercise ingenuity. The proposal may be rejected at home, though it is not far away from the idea in the sub-committee&apos;s paragraph 112, or it may be rejected abroad, though it should have a somewdiat better chance there than paragraph 112 (a) as it stands. In any case, I put it forward for examination. Cm the widest grounds, and for the sake both of ourselves and of the world, we must have a hand to play and take a lead possibly the lead in playing it; and no card that might strengthen it should be rejected out of hand.47. Finally, we must face the possibility of our total contribution being rejected, with the consequent failure foreseen in my memorandum of the 21st September. This is a strong possibility. Europe is now in a number of bad tempers, with prolific sources of quarrel, with little^evinced disposition to save her soul and skin by reasonable settlements. She has not hitherto been satisfied or appeased by our large and reasonable contribution both in substance and suggestion during a bitter and fruitless decade; and the jack-o&apos;-lantern
0s?improvement is for ever a stage further for us on unsound ground. There must be an end somewhere to this process, and the end had best be now. It is here that the element of pressure comes in, and it applies to Europe ,all round, including especially both the present protagonists, the French and the German. Balzac once observed that &quot;business is other people&apos;s money.&quot; For us European ^ politics are mostly other peoples&apos; feuds and grievances. We have sxpeaeded e^-^^^-some foreign causes, but a point has come where we can go no further than &quot; according to plan &quot; in political polygamy. We have been taken for granted, and we are not granted. Beyond a certain point, the quarrels of Europe are not our quarrels, and the point may now be reached when, failing agreement on our contribution, we must say so (vide Cabinet conclusion (b) (i) of the 15th December). This has been the consistent attitude both of our statesmen and of our people. What I am saying may sound drastic, but there is nothing new or startling in it. It is nothing but an ancient and ineradicable fact, which implies no diminution of our sympathy, our faith, our collaboration so far as the League of Nations is concerned. All that is new is the opportunity in the literal sense of making it plain, the manner in which it is conveyed and this paragraph is intended to convey not the words but their background and the account to which it can be turned in a crisis. It may be the moment or never. We have a fresh chance; we have a National Government that has impressed, though it may not suit, the rest of the world. &quot; At this critical moment in our history it is clear that British foreign policy must be formulated on a very broad basis.&quot; I fear that the Disarmament Conference will run almost entirely on political and technical lines, and that, with the reservation that follows, economic factors will come little into play, as contemplated in CP. 301 (31). Its authors therein discuss two tariff policies : (1) to batter down high tariffs and reconcile Europe; (2) a high tariff with Empire preference. They add that the first would best suit the Foreign Office and the world ! I do not dissent. But if Europe will not have our contribution and collaboration, she will be driving us progressively from the frame of mind of the first to the frame of mind of the second. It may be that the largest problem of our future will be to combine or reconcile a policy of Empire with a policy of Europe. The latter will have to remind herself of what she already knows, that, at heart at least, we are not primarily concerned with her, that we have that other policy with its responsibilities, its interests and its development. In particular, if she will not recognise it, we might even conceivably and eventually have to choose between them. We are bound to Europe by geography and economics; the map and the figures speak for themselves so far. If Europe rejects collaboration and recon- \, ciliation, will not be houses-broken, and proceeds to make the place relatively c^1^ n i uninhabitable, she willlbe driving us into the Commonwealth as surely as Germany ewas driven into Deutschlands. We are still eager Jto play our part, must indeed continue to play a part, but on the extent of it the last word rests with her. We can continue to play a lead, or we can at will, and without ostensible change of garb or character, simply &quot;walk on,&quot; and still draw a salary. It may be countered that there is some bluff in this, that some of us have but tempered illusions about the Commonwealth, which has its full share of mauvais coucheurs. The answer is, firstly, that there is some bluff in it, as well as truth; but that the move would be, at need, a legitimate and even requisite one. On the one hand, France still counts on us, at a more remote pinch; she has persistently and foolishly quarrelled with two out of the three most prolific European nations, Germany and Italy, and often with the third, Russia, whom she suspects of &quot;laying&quot; for a couple of her satellites, Poland and Roumania. She would be very reluctant to contemplate a gradual cooling on our part towards Europe, by which she understands herself, for this would tend to leave her eventually more alone with these more prolific mothers of children. Germany, on the other hand, would be most loth to compromise our honest brokerage, and to contemplate herself, particularly now, en tete-a-tete with a predominant French block bereft of either moderator or counter-weight. We should be a loss to the club as a full subscriber, and the resident members, especially, perhaps the less heavy ones, would shrink from thinking of us on a reduced fee. If it be objected that the suggested intimation would be a bold move, it is submitted that a point may be reached in the course of this year where bold moves will be essential to success, and should at least be weighed in advance. If it-be objected that such an intimation would be difficult to regulate in practice, the
reply must be that, while we cannot, and would not wish, to imitate the American ostrich, there are many European occasions on which it would suit us well and better to be unrepresented or represented merely by an observer. I fancy that the Secretary of State for the Dominions would endorse this view, if he still has in mind last summer&apos;s Convention for the Creation of an International Agricultural Mortgage Credit Company, when interests of South-Eastern Europe were not in harmony with those of the Dominions. From that impasse we have been extricated by our well-understood financial stringency. But there are others; examples could be developed with more time at my disposal and without detriment to our League position, though there may not be much League left to work for -if the conference fails. It is a question of an attitude and a tendency more than anything else, but we should get full value for it. At present, as for Locarno, we get none.48. Into this particular valley of decision, however, we need not descend until we have seen as much as possible of the country ahead from the Great Divide of 1932, and as this memorandum is already of inordinate length, I will end it by summarising the programme which I have adumbrated :  (1) The conference to open with speeches designed to create a favourable atmosphere. These may well occupy a month or more, and will be followed by the setting up of committees.(2) By private conversations early during the conference we must endeavour to prevent an overt clash between the French and German theses.(3) Our own contribution to be produced in public as late as possible and preferably not before May, will consist of two complementary halves, designed the one to satisfy legitimate French demands for more security, the other to convince Germany that we are in favour of definite steps towards limitation of armaments on a fair basis.Under the former heading come (a) Consolidation in one instrument of our present commitments.(b) A declaration about treaty revision.(c) A declaration of our intention to honour our existing obligations.     -(d) An interpretation of the Locarno Treaty regarding the northern ports of France (paragraph 33).(e) A Mediterranean Locarno (paragraph 38). (/) A European protocol (paragraph 39).(g) Germany to sign the General Act (paragraph 40).(h) Germany, among other nations, to agree to a political truce for a termof years (paragraph 41 and annex).Under the latter come (i) Abrogation of naval clauses of Treaty of Versailles, on condition thatGermany agrees to limitation by categories (paragraph 43). (ii) A time limit to  the  disarmament  clauses of  the  Peace  Treaty (paragraph 44).(iii) Concessions to Germany in matters of military aircraft, tanks and heavy guns (paragraph 45).(iv) An arrangement about conscription on the lines of paragraph 46.49. This looks a formidable list, and I am prepared to learn that this or that item is decreed impracticable. I am also aware that items (i) to (iv) tend rather to rearmament rather than to disarmament. But since we have no material contribution of British disarmament to make, and since our written obligations, as well as our interests, compel us not to go empty-handed to Geneva, I venture to submit these proposals, convinced as I am that only by some such means can the divergent views of France and Germany be reconciled, even for a term of years.50. Our position, in summary, is this : If we do not take some risk in these coming months, we may be running a larger risk in the coming years. Why should that be so? For this reason. We have let our strength deteriorate on the strength of the duration and efficacity of the League.    (In some respects
the results have been almost ludicrous : there is not, so far as I know, a. coastal-defence gun in the Empire that cannot be outshot by an 8-inch-gun cruiser, without possibility of reply.) If, by failure, of the ponferance the League breaks down in 1932, what courses are opert^to us? Iii &quot;Europe there would seem to be three : (i) Such a programme of rearmament, or rather of remedied deficiencies, as no British Government could, I submit, well face in the immediate future, either financially or politically and by politically I am thinking largely of internal politics, (ii) Acceptance and perpetuation of the present French hegemony. Already we are in a position where, if France on any point chose seriously to insist, we should be unable to resist. Even if we accept that unhealthy condition, how long will Europe do so ? It would be like to prove an unendurable condition that would endure till the next war. (iii) A return to the old and vicious &quot;balance of power.&quot;We have learned by experience what that is apt to mean, and that is something perilously like the result of (ii). There is, in theory, a fourth possibility, and that is to act upon (i) and to remain rigorously aloof. But we know, both by experience and by already existing commitments, that this is impossible in practice. In any of these events, the conduct of foreign policy would become extremely difficult, and the assumption of ten years of peace would have to be dropped at once.R. V.January 1, 1932.Annex.1. Increasingly impressed by the urgent necessity for establishing confidence and good understanding between nations;2. Conscious of the almost insurmountable difficulties which the traditions of the past have placed in the way of this effort;3. Gravely disturbed by the dangers with which Europe will be threatened should the present crisis continue, and convinced, that the overwhelmingly important interest of peoples is the immediate economic reconstruction of the Continent as a whole :4. The Governments of ... . make the following declaration, in which it is hoped that the other Powers of Europe will join;5. During a period of five/ten years they solemnly agree to subordinate their old differences to the promotion of their common welfare, to refrain from actions likely to revive past quarrels or to bring existing agreements into the field of polemics, and generally to renounce and discountenance all proceedings liable to disturb good relations.6. The gravity of this present crisis has ahead)&apos; had the effect of establishing between the economic and financial centres of the signatory countries, contacts of ah intimate and friendly nature, and in order to strengthen this entente the signatory Governments will, during the said period, exert themselves to give these contacts a still greater and more methodical development. To this end they agree to meet periodically for direct exchange of views on any matter of common importance.
