A&apos; COPY WO, CP. 8(52).CAB I HE T.TRJL?5 TT.TOJUX PAY^N TS-Memorandum by ^the Minisft ere of Health and Labour.1.     As instructed by the Cabinet in Conclusion 4 of Cabinet 89(31) we submit a report of the working or* the transitional payments scheme.     The scheme began only on the 12th ilovember, and the period allowed for the disposing of the initial accumulation of cases does not expire till the 12th instant. We cannot therefore give more than a preliminary impression with regard to its workings2.     On the whole it may fairly be claimed not only that the scheme has been successfully launched but that the diffioultiea and complaints have been less then might reasonably have been expected.     A certain number of local authorities were reluctant either to start the scheme or to carry on in face of difficulties that developed locally.     Some threatened to go on strike.     With tfhe difficulties at Sheffield for the time toeing removed, so far as is known all local authorities are now administering the Order in Council.3.     The cases decided up to 2nd January (excluding reviews of previous assessments) numbered approximately 800,000 distributed reughly as follows:-Number.   Per,, cent.Assessed at full rate of benefit ........    360,000        45Assessed at less than full rate ofbenefit ..........    280,000        35Assessed at nil.........................    160,000       &quot;20800,000       100 TO TAX:__;___At 2nd January there remained about 150,000 cases still awaiting a first assessment.
1JL fv U4.     The chief difficulties that have arisen may &quot;be classed under three headings:-   (a) Disability Pensions; (b) Savings; (c) Family Income.(a) Disability Pensions have caused more difficulty on the platform than in practice.     Ho evidence exists of harshness by Public Assistance Committees dealing with war disabled men though, of course, we may find some individual cases where the decision nay be challenged on this ground.     Considerable latitude in accordance with existing Public Assistance principles is being exercised by Public Assistance Committees generally with regard to disabled men and no objection is being raised hy  us.(b) Savings.    There have been difficulties also with regard to persons in possession of savings.     Under the Poor Law a person in possession of available assets is not a lawful subject of relief.      In accordance, however, with the Circular L.A.3 sent to local authorities, if, in the treatment of individual cases of persons who have savings, authorities for thetime  apply standards which, for easily comprehensible reasons are somewhat less strict tha^vthe normal standards of public assistance, it has not been regarded as calling for immediate intervention by us.     Wh re, however, authorities ad&apos;jpt a practice of paying transitional payments, i.e. State relief to persons with appreciable liquid assets, pressure is being applied in order to bring them into line;    on the other hand,  in one or two oases where the strict Poor Law principle was being applied in such a way as to create hardship authorities have been given a hint to exercise more discretion.(c)  ^Al7-J;r;:L^!.*    In some parts of the country there has been objection to the principle that the incomes of all the members of the household sharing the same table are taken into account.     The principle of the family as a unit is, however, fundamental to public assistance and must be maintained.   No Public Assistance Authority has seriously challenged this principle.
5.    The &quot;Manchester Guardian&apos; has been publishing rdpjroa on its own enquiries into the working of the scheme, and on31st December summed up the position thuss    &quot;The results .....suggest that, although our local correspondent have not found complaints of hardship to be general in their districts, there are wide disparities in the administration of the test&quot;. 6.    The &quot;Guardian&quot; is not a friendly critic and its statement with regard to the absence of complaints of general hardship is therefore a valuable confirmation of the impression we have ourselves formed.     The stress which it lays upon disparities is equally important.As was pointed out in CP. 260(31) before the scheme was launched variety of standards is a well-known feature of the Public Assistance system and is necessarily imported into the transitional payments scheme now in operation.     &quot;We shall undoubtedly be pressed strongly to remove the disparities by laying down the standards to he applied even though, as is in faot the case, this would require legislation; there are, however, grave objections to such a course, as set out in CP. 289 (31) , CP. 260(31)  and CP. 211 (31)  and we must continue to resist all proposals of this kind. 7.   The Order in Council deliberately omitted any Ministerial power to intervene in individual cases, and even as regards general principles the only criterion is the Public,Assistance standard, which cannot be altered or defined by Ministerial regulations or instructions.   Pressure has, however, been brought to bear on a few authorities which were departing widely from their own Public Assistance standards.   In some other cases a difficult situation was being created by rigid adherence to an undiscriminating Poor Law standard where in neighbouring areas
an easier standard was being applied.   Here it was more difficult to intervene, but an attempt has been made to get over the difficulty by pointing out to the authority that as a Public Assistance Authority it possesses a reasonable discretion which it can and should exercise. 8.     The general line taken has been that wherever Public Assistance Authorities interpret the Order in Council in a responsible manner, full allowance will be made for their difficulties and for the time being they are not being pressed to comply with the strict interpretation of the law. 9,    Deputations from some of the larger Local Authorities have been interviewed in the two Departments.   The Impression has been gathered that a good deal of the difficulties have been due to a lack of realisation both on the part of the authorities and of the public that transitional payments are really nothing else than State relief, that applicants have long exhausted any contractual right to unemployment benefit, and that in the present finanoial emergency the State has a right to withhold relief save in those oases where the with-holding of relief would cause undue hardship.   The change of attitude following on this being made clear has been very striking.10.      As regards financial results, it is too early to speak precisely, but the indications are that the saving, on the present basis, will be of an amount oomparable with that estimated in the Soonomy Bill White Paper, viz.  10 millions a year on a live register of 3,000,000.11.      It would be too much to expect that so soon after the inception of the soheme, local authorities in all areas would be administering it strictly in accordance with the lawj   and
1It Is not surprioirjng t-het. some authorities are departingsubstantially from public assistance practice in assessing the amount of the payment a,able to take in the dli-ec Lion of controlling the assessments made by authorities has necessarily been limited.   Even if it had been possible to scrutinise the work of the numerous bodies concerned, it has been considered Inadvisable to bring immediate pressure on them to secure a strict compliance with the Order in Councilo12.        Now that the scheme is launched it will be our next task to endeavour by methods of administration to correct Irregularities, and remove as far as possible differences in practice.   The only express power of control on the transitional payments side is the extreme measure of supersession, and any attempt to proceed too rapidly would be dangerous.   We can only apply methods of guidance and admonition, and the first step will be to continue the careful survey of the administration in the various areas now being made by the Inspectors of the Ministry of Health and of the Department of Health for Scotland.   We cannot be certain in advance that these administrative methods will prove to be adequate, but in our opinion this is clearly the line on which we should proceed. 13.       We should add that the problem of what provision is to be made permanently for persons who fall outside the Insurance Scheme is one of the terms of reference to the Royal Commission.   Pending their recommendations, it is clear from experience of the l .st six weeks that, provided the principle of the &quot;Means Test&quot; Is to continue, that te3t can most conveniently and economically be applied by the Public Assistance Committees.   Looking baok It is oertaln that the two Departments concerned could not have set up the neoessaryThe action which the two Departments have yet been
machinery and It is more than doubtful whether the limited discretion that can properly he vested in Government officials could have satisfactorily met the infinite variety of personal oircumstances involved. On the whole the local authorities have played their part admirably and have shown great public spirit in oarrylng through a heavy and often unpleasant duty.(Intld.)
