*3 I&apos;. 9ij z) &amp;/b IX)CUMENT 16 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJLSTYW government EBNMEirrVCOPY MO.      cabinet.32) .Trawling in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde. Memorandum by the   Secretary of Statefor Scotland.I desire to submit for decision the question of the policy to be adopted in regard to trawlin^ in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde.     The history and present position are explained below.     Briefly put trawling in these areas is prohibited in pursuance of the Herring Fishery (ocotland) Act, 1889.     Since 1907, however, the prohibition (although upheld by the High Court of Justiciary) has not been enforced against foreign trawlers.     Although foreigners are prevented from landing their catches in the United Kingdom they enjoy a privilege over British trawlers by admission to the Firths. Their admission arouses great complaint from the local fishermen whose representations receive strong support in all parts of Scotland.     Repeated attention has been called to this situation and successive Governments have been pressed to remedy it - tiie last Parliamentary occasion being the Debate in the House of Commons on 3rd June, 1931. .It appears to me to be of great importance that the present Government should reach a decision on the questions of policy involved, and I, therefore, submit my proposals with explanations which I am afraid are necessarily rather lengthy.An additional reason for obtaining a decision is that the Netherlands Government has asked the Foreign Office whether H.M-Government are willing to participate in an International Fishery Conference to consider the revision ana extension of the North i*ea Convention, 1882,and in my opinion the reply to begiven/
given is dependent on a decision on the foregoing questions of policy.Questions relating to fishing in the Scottish Firths are at least as bid as the Union of the Crowns and England and Scotland have frequently had disputes about them. The history o-f the question of trawling in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde since 1889 is briefly as follows:-Moray Firth.Section 7 of the abovr mentioned Act of 1889 pro-vides that beam and otter trawling nay be prohibited in any part of the Moray Firth by Byelaw   nade by the Fishery Board for Scotland and confirmed by the Secretary for Scotland. The existihrr, Byelaw made and confirmed in 1092 prohibits such trawling in the whole of the I^oray Firth.     In 1905 a full Bench of the High Court of Justiciary (13 Judges) decided on appeal in the case of Mortensen v. Peters that, as a matter of construction the Act of 1089 applies to foreign as well as to British subjects, and that 1&apos;ortensen (a foreign /^n subject acting as Master of a vessel registered in a foreiJ?n country) was rightly convicted of a contravention of the Byelaw.     The Court had not to decide the question whether the Act of the Legislature was or was not in contravention of generally acknowledged principles of international law but some of tho Judges referred to certain aspects of international law in relation to the territoriality of bays.     In particular Lord Dunedin said there were at least three points which went far to show that the locus of Mortensen&apos;s offence (about 5 miles off Lossiexnouth) was intra fauces terrae. i.e. within the jaws of the land.     Lord Kyllachy oonoidered that it was vain to suggest that according to international law there was ahy part of the Moray Firth which was simply an area of the open Sea,Early/
Early in 1907 further convictions were obtained against foreign Masters of trawlers registered in Norway for breaches of the Byelaw committed in the Moray Firth at distances varying from about 5 to 12 miles from the coast. On the formal protest of the Norwegian Government, however, the Foreign Office intervened and the foreign skippers who had been sent to prison were released.     Since 1907 no attempt has been made by any British Government tc prosecute foreign trawlerB for trawling in the Moray Firth.In order to stop or reduce trawling by foreigners in the Moray Firth and similar areas Parliament in 1909 passed the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Prevention Act, which forbids the landing or sale in the United Kingdom of any fish caught by trawling in the Moray Firth or other prohibited areas. This has been effective in stopping the landing of catches at British ports , but both before and after the war foreign trawlers have worked in the Moray Firth and landed their catches at foreign portsi Firth of OlvAe.The legal position is substantially the same except that Section .6 of the Act of 1889 ftirectly prohibits trawling in the Firth of Clyde * unless the Fishery Board for Scotland give permission by Byelaw confirmed by the Secretary for Scotland.     Since 1907 foreigners have not been prosecuted for trawling in the Firth of Clyde.     Following the Act of 1909 few foreigners trawled in the Firth of Clyde until about 1927.     In the period 1927/3ii however, incursions by foreign trawlers have greatly increased reaching in 1931 a total of 22 vessels (all Dutch) who were observed on 119 occasions.In 1929 the Fishery Board for Scotland proposed a Byclaw opening experimentally for three years an   area in the outer part of the Firth of Clyde for 5 months in the year.     The then Secretary of State for Scotland, however,decided/
decided not to confirm the Byelaw.      In giving his reasons in the House of Commons he said that he thought that it would be inexpedient to take any partial action in the direction of modifying existing restrictions on trawling which might prejudice or complicate wider international issues.The present position in the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde is, therefore, that while the Sections of the Act and the Bj^elaw have not been repealed or modified no Government since 1907 has enforced then although there is no doubt that the Courts would convict if prosecutions were authorised.Foreign trawlora (mostly Dutch) operate in con-siderable numbers in the Horsy Firth and Firth of Clyde enjoying a privilege over British trawlers and injuring the interests of tho local fishermen both by depleting the quantity of fish on tho grounds and in the oaae of the kor&amp;y Firth by dsaagln.&quot;- the anchored cod nets which some of the men use.     The economic effects of the operations of the foreign trawlers have become extremely important during recent years because the herring fishings on which the Horay Firth fishermen mainly depend hove been very adversely affected by economic conditions and have not provided a livelihood, particularly during the past year - when the conditions could only be described as disastrous.     As a set off to the deficiencies thus caused in their earnings it is essential that the fishermen should have as full opportunities as possible of developing their supplementary occupation of catching white fish with lines, etc. in their home waters.      In all about 8,000 fishermen are involved and I need not emphasise the deterrent effect which the foreign trawlers have on their efforts to find a way out of their/ . \ dsspcrato/
desperate position.In a sentence I consider the present position in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde to he an indefensible one which urgently calls for remedy.     The general policy which I recommend is to maintain the existing prohibition of trawling and to endeavour to make it effective against foreign as it now is against British fishermen,     (when that has been done but not before, it may be practicable to consider a partial relaxation of the prohibition in the Firth of Clyde which would benefit British trawlers).1 have considered the following alternative methods for making the closure of the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde effective against foreign trawlers.(a)   To resume the prosecution of foreign trawlersfound working in the Firths,There is no doubt that the Courts would convict following on the unanimous decision of the High Court of -Justiciary in Mortensen v. Peters.     I realise, however, that this course^might raise international questions as to the extent of British rights of sovereignty or jurisdiction in these areas and that a determination of those questions is not practicable at present.     On that point the Lord \ Advocate in the Debate on 3r;1 $une last after referring to the judgments of Lord Dune din and Lord Kyllachy said &quot;I think it may quite properly be said, therefore, although it might be disputed by foreign countries that the Moray Firth is within the territorial jurisdiction of this count-ry&quot;, While preserving our claims in this respect I accept the view that the prosecution of foreigners should not be resumed in present circumstances if a satisfactory alter-native can be found.(5) (b)/
(b)   To ondearour to conclude with the Powers concerned a Convention specifying the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde as part of the &quot;exclusive fishery limits&quot; of the British Isles.This course has advantages from svy standpoint but I recognise that it would probably present greater difficulties from the standpoint of other Departments than the policy mentioned in (c) below.     I should, therefore, be prepared to agree to (c) as a compromise.(o)   To endeavour to conclude with the Powers concerned a Convention requiring foreign fishermen to observe the restrictions for the time being applied by H.M. Government to British fishermen in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde.This is the line of policy redommended by the Departmental. Committee presided over by Lord liackenzie whose report was published early in 1924.     As stated above, I am prepared to accept it if it is regarded by other Departments as presenting fewer difficulties than either of the foregoing policies from their standpoint.     I submit, however, that this policy represents the minimum demand Upon other States which will meet the case.The Tleport of the Economic Advisory Council !s Com-mittee on the Fishing Industry (of which the Cabinet took note on the 11th January )  refers to the tyhestions of the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde in paragraphs 370 - 382, and in paragraph 383(48) and (49) (see Appendiic I).     In paragraph 376 the Committee explain that on the question of securing the application of the present restrictions to foreign trawlers &quot;a large number of important considerations become relevant on which it would be outside our province to express an opinion and on many of which we have taken no evidence&quot;.     As regards(6) the/
the Moray Firth, however, the Committee recommend that the Departments of State concerned should carefully consider &amp;-suggestion &quot;that Hi3 Majesty&apos;s Government should put forward for the consideration of the foreign Powers concerned pro-posals for modifying existing International Conventions, which, while securing the immediate object of closing the Firth to foreigners will avoid the possible dangers alluded to in the preceding paragraph&quot;.     This is the same method as I propose in Paragraph   5 (c).     I have discussed the matter with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries who considers that, as it is a question which concerns more than one Department, it ought to be decided by the Cabinet.With regard to the Firth of Clyde, the Committee (subject to a reservation by Mr. Murray) suggest con-sideration of the possibility of securing international agreement to the effective closing of the Firth failing an agreed byelaw for the partial removal of the present res-restrictions (end of Paragraph 382).     I am satisfied that such a byelaw could, not be agreed and moreover that any modification which would still leave the foreign trawler in a privileged position in the Firth of Clyde, would be open to great objection,     I therefore propose that the policy in Paragraph 5 (c) should be adopted for the Firth of Clyde as well as the Moray Firth.     In this instance also the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries considers that the qu-stion ought to be decided by the Cabinet.I anticipate that the British Trawlers&apos; Federation (which made representations to my predecessor after the Debate in June last) may suggest that the policy (c) involves risk to their interests by encouraging Iaeland or other countries to take similar action.     It should be remembered, however, that in the case of the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde H.M. Government is dealing with areas(7) in/
in which for 25 years foreign vessels have had the exclusive privilege of trawling.     So far as I am aware there are no areas in any foreign countries which are in similar case, and if so, this important difference would justify H\H. Government in denying that the proposal (c) as to the Scottish Firths affords any justification for a claim by (say) Iceland to similar treatment of any of her inlets even it they are comparable with the Scottish Firths in geographical and other circumstances.In this connection I would point out that the only real alternatives to the policy of effective closure of the Scottish Fifths against foreigners are (l) to maintain the present unsatisfactory position, (2) to open the Firths to British and foreign trawlers with disastrous results to the local communities of fishermen.     I submit that each of these is out of the question.An international agreement which expressly authorised foreign trawlers to work in the Moray Firth subject to regulations intended to protect anchored cod nets would afford a doubtful protection to the latter and would involve either (l) continuance of the anomalous privilege of the foreign trawlers or (2) opening of the Moray Firth to British as well as foreign trawlers.     The latter would be disastrous to line and other fishermen whose catch in the Firth averages about  200,000 a year as compared with an average catch of about  20,000 a year with anchored cod nets.If my colleagues endorse the policy which I recommend, in paragraph 5 (o) the method, of carrying it out requires consideration.In ordinary course it would be appropriate for II.M. Government to propose an International Conference of the Powers concerned in order to discuss the pronosed Convention.la) As/
As already stated, however, the Netherland Government (after discussions with France) has proposed an International Conference to consider the revision of the North Sea Convention of 1882 and the extension of its area southwards, westwards and northwards (see the annexed copy of the Netherlands Minister^s letter to the Foreign Office -Appendix II).     In so doing the Netherland Government may have in mind the strong criticisms recently directed again at their country owing to the damage caused by Dutch trawlers to anchored cod nets in the Moray Firth.I suggest that the policy (c), if approved by my collee,colleagues. should be made an essential condition of the participation of HeM, Government in the International Conference proposed by the Netherland Government and I should be in favour of participation on this condition and not otherwise.     In my opinion the Government would be exposed to serious criticism in Scotland if it entered into an International Conference for revision and extension of the North Sea Convention and omitted to put forward proposals for a satisfactory solution of the problem of the Scottish Firths.(Id.)

APPENDIX I. Extract from Conclusions of Committee of Economic Advisory Council.(48) The Moray Firth.A difficult situation has existed for many years in the Moray Firth owing to its partial olosing to trawling under the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1389.     Acting on the powers conferred upon them by this Act, the Fishery Board for Scotland made by a by-law closing the Firth to trawling.     It was not long, however, before difficulties were experienced in its application to foreign trawlers. Litigation took place in the High Court in Scotland, which decided, as a matter of construction, that the Act could be eniorced against all persons of whatever nationality. Shortly afterwards, however, the situation was transformed by the decision of Eis Majesty&apos;s Government in 1907, on representations received from the Norwegian Government, to release the foreign skippers then in prison in this country and to discontinue the prosecution of foreigners for offences under the Act .     In the twenty-four years that have elapsed since this decision was taken in 190 7, no change has taken place in the legal position apart from the passing of the Trawling in Prohibited Areas Act, 1909, which prohibits the landing or sale of fish within the United Kingdom from vessels which within the two previous months have caught fish or have taken on board fish whioh has been caught within the areas set out in the Act of 1889, including the Moray Firth.     The position thus is that British trawlers are excluded from the Firth, although trawling by foreign vessels is permitted.(!) Our/
Our conclusion on this question is that the balance of advantage as between one section of the fishing industry and another (particularly in Scotland) is in favour of continuing, for the time being, the olosure of the Moray Firth to British trawlers.     The exclusion of foreign trawlers from the Firth, if attempted, would raise important questions of general polioy.     It has been suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should put forward, for the consideration of the foreign Powers concerned proposals for modifying existing International Conventions which, while securing the immediate object of closing the Firth to foreigners, will avoid the possible dangers alluded to in the preceding paragraph.     We consider that the practicability of this suggestion should be carefully considered by the Departments of State concerned. We think,, however, that in the meantime all possible steps should be taken to ensure that the cod-net fishermen adequately mark, light and watch their nets.     If this were done, it would be of advantage if arrangements were made for the more intensive patrolling of the Moray Firth by the vessels of H.M. Fishery Protection Service, and by the cruisers oi: the Fishery Board for Scotland, with a view to putting a stop to the activities of any foreign trawlers who damage anchored cod-nets when properly lighted and marked. ,Ve suggest that the necessary arrangements to this end should be made by the Fishery Board for Scotland. (Paragraphs .370-37? .)(49)   The Firth of Clyde.The Firth of Clyde is closed to trawling under the provisions of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889. In this case also the restrictions of the Act against foreign vessels have not been enforced since 1907;    and trawlers of foreign registration appear regularly in increasing numbers
in the Pirth each year.     The alternative courses are: (i) the maintenance of the status quo, (ii) the effective closing, of the Pirth to foreigners or (iii) the opening of the Pirth to trawlers.     Legally there appears to be a stronger case for the second course than ,there is in the Moray Pirth.     The objections, however, to the admission of trawlers to the Pirth of Clyde are much weaker.     The consideration which appears to us one of the most significant is that the local fishermen do not mate use of the valuable local hake fishing.     It is clearly absurd to allow this to remain a monopoly of foreign fishing vessels.There are no good grounds for maintaining the status quo in the Pirth of Clyde., the closure of which to British trawlers inflicts a definite hardship on the British trawling industry.     Further, no real injury to the local fishermen would be li.-.ely to follow the removal of the present restrictions to the extent proposed by the Fishery Board ior Scotland in their &quot;by-law in 1928.   The menis fears on this subject are, we believe, largely misconceived.     Ii, as a result of renewed discussion with the Fishery Board ior Scotland, the fishermen were prepared to withdraw their opposition, the way would be clear for the Fishery Board for Scotland to submit to the Secretary of State for Scotland for confirmation such an agreed by-law.     Failing this, it would be for the Departments to consider whether such a by-law should be made notwithstand-ing this opposition, or whether it would be possible to secure international agreement to the effective closing of the Firth.    (Paragraphs 37 8 - 382.;
I have the honour to inform you that the necessity has been felt in the Netherlands to revise and amend the International Convention Hegulating the Police of the North Sea Fisheries, signed at The Hague, May 6th, 1882, many of its provisions having become antiquated on account of modernised fishing methods.Some time ago the French Government intimated the desire to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to conclude an inter-national agreement with the object to provide rules as to claims for salvage of nets and to protection^of nets in the open sea.The Netherland Government agreeing in principle with the French proposals and being of the opinion that it is desirable to revise the Convention of 1882 in its entirety proposed to hold an International Conference at The Hague which shall deal with all questions adherent to the fisheries in the North Sea.     The French Government concurred with this view.In accordance with instructions received from His Excsllency the Minister of Foreign Affairs I venture to enquire whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland view these proposals favourably and are prepared to participate in an International Conference to be held at The Hague at a date to be fixed later in order to revise the Convention of 1882 and discuss the   French proposals regarding the protection of nets.The Netherland Government suggest the following points for discussions:(1) 1./Netherlands Legation,LONDON, 23nd May,1931.
9 p rr3 jThe limits Of the Convention (art.4).It is proposed to extend the limits Northwards, Southwards arid Westwards, so as to bring the English Channel and the Northern regions under the Convention. z .   ReRistration marks.,As art.8 only applies to sailing vessels it is desirable to incorporate rules for other types of fishing vessels.   Article 11 also wants revision as practice has shown that the existing regulations are riot always observed. 3.   Article 14 - .24.,These articles which provide minute rules to avoid conflicts between the different fishing vessels should be altered and amended as the methods of fishing with which they deal are out of date. 4*   galvage of fishing implements.As already stated by the Prenoh Government the want is felt for uniform rules regulating the amount whioh the owners shall pay to the salvors of their nets. 5.   C, iyil action for ^recovery of damage to fishing gear,The Convention should contain regulations governing this subject.I have, &amp;c, (Signed) R. de Marees van Swinderen.The Right HonourableArthur Henderson, M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c,, &amp;c.
