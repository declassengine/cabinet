9 &apos;7 this  Document Is the property of His Britannic Majestyls Government.CRET - CABINET. j.P. 37  (32) horay Firth. wMemorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for Scotland appears to accept, at all events for the time being,  the view strongly hold by the Admiralty, Board of Trade and Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and I believe by tho Foreign Office also, ,thnt the attempt to close the Moray Firth, either by claiming it as territorial waters or (which In International Law is tha same thing, since exclusive fishing is essentially a soverign right) by getting it recognised as part of the exclusive fishery limits of the United Kingdom, would not serve the national interests hut only the interests of a small number of Scottish fishermen.     Therefore this larger question, which was fully discussed by my predecessor last year in CJ.P. 185(31), need not be reopened here.The proposal which the Secretary of State for Scotland now recommends is that the Foreign Powers concerned should he pressed to agree to their fishermen being subject to the restrictions applicable to British fishermen in the Moray Firth,  -of which restrictions the most important is the prohibition of trawling,- and that acceptance of this policy shall he a condition of our participation in the proposed International Conference to consider the revision of the North Sea Convention of 1882.I leave It to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to say whether this sudden demand that Foreign Powers shall surrender what they may reasonably regard as valid international rights might not seem rather a brusque reply to a proposal for an International Conference.The practical objections which I see to the proposal are the improbability of any of the countries concerned agreeing to make this concession without demanding valuable concessions In exchange,  and the danger of proceeding on the very unsafe assumption that such demand can simply be refused.    We should probably be forced into a bargaining match with the other Powers,/in
9 n hin which case our representatives must be carefully instructed, not only to resist proposals Injurious to the interests of the British Trawler Industry, which from a national point of view ar far more important than those of the Scottish inshore fishermen, hut also proposals in any way compromising our traditional resistance to attempts to extend the limits of territorial waters.In this connection, the Admiralty assume that, If a Convention on the lines suggested is obtainable without sacrifice of larger Interests, the restrictions agreed to would be enforced in the manner provided for by the North Sea Convention, under which the Navies of the High Contracting Powers alone have the right of supervision and offenders arc triable only In the courts of this own country,     A claim that British vessels should have the sole right of supervision and that offenders should be triable only in the Scottish courts would be tantamount to claiming the Moray Firth as territorial waters.In the above remarks I have referred particular! to the Moray Firth, because It is a much more difficult case tha that of the Firth cf Clyde, which the Secretary of State for Scotland couples with it in his memorandum.       On the ground of configuration there Is some justification in International Law for claiming the Firth of Clyde as national waters, whilst there is no such justification in the case of the great open area of the Moray Firth.B. E. M.%iiralty,:5th January 1952.
