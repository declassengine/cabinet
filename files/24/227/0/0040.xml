River Plate House,Finsbury Circus,London, E.C.2.22nd January,  1932.Rt. Hon. Walter Runciman, P.C President,H.M. Board of Trade.LL.DM.PSir,The policy of Imperial Preference has been broughtto the notice of H.M. Government as one of the measures which would be helpful in assisting the financial position in this country and augmenting its trade with the Dominions and Colonies.     Consideration will no doubt be given by H.M. Government to this question.In the event of legislation on such lines being decided upon, consideration will doubtless be similarly given as to the best means of retaining and extending our trade with foreign countries under the altered conditions which would then arise.In this latter connection it is desired to bring to the notice of H.2vt. Government the magnitude and importance of the business and trade interchanged between this country and the Argentine Republic and of the very large amount of capital invested by British Nationals in that country.The gentlemen whom I have the honour to introduce to you and.whose names are appended to this letter, are deputed to represent the principal financial and commercial interests directly connected with Argentina(a^ Banking and FinanceCb) Railways(c) public Utilities (other than Railways)(*d) Land and Pastoral(e^ Cold Storage and Heat Products(f) Shipping(g) Cables and Wireless
9 QBalance of Trade.Advantage to the British tfercantile Marine.5. During the Decade ended in 1930, the average annualturnover of visible trade between the two countries was 97,379,404 87,402,976  116,445,879  67,398,787Example of Argent ine Railways.These figures compare with -for Canada    .........for Australia .......for New Zealand     ......Of the average visible trade turnover quoted above  69,772,995 of 71.65 per cent consists of imports by the United Kingdom from the Argentine, while exports to that country stand at  27,606,409 or 28.35 per cent of the total;    leaving an average yearly balance of &apos;visible&apos; trade against the United Kingdom of  42,166,585.Outside the British Empire there is no country where British capital and enterprise have played so great a part as in Argentina,  and to-day it is estimated that between  400,000,000 and  500,000,000 of British capital is invested in that country.     The service on these invest-ments reduces the average of the unfavourable visible balance of trade between the two countries over the decade ending 1930 from  42,000,000 to  21,000,000. 4. It is difficult to determine in figures the value toBritish shipping of the carrying trade between this country and the Argentine, but H.M. Commercial Secretary in Buenos Aires states that not less than 5,000,000 tons of British shipping visit Argentine ports annually.     The earnings of this tonnage will further reduce the visible balance of trade between the two countries. 5. Of British capital in Argentina no less than 270,000,000 is invested in Railways controlled from London. These railways during the ten-year period 1921/30 spent in the United Kingdom on materials, stores and freights a sum of  75,000,000.     Of this amount, freights paid to the
British shipping companies accounted for nearly  9,000,000. The proprietors have received during a similar period sums amounting to  120,000,000 in the form of interest and dividends derived from their enterprises in Argentina, and these proprietors from their profits have naturally contributed their proper proportion to the Exchequer, e&apos; 6. It should also be borne in mind that the sterlingbonds of the Argentine Government held in the United Kingdom and included in the capital invested in Argentina, as stated in paragraph 5, require, in respect of interest and sinking funds, the remittance to London of over  4,000,000 annually, and that such monies can only be provided by Argentina by the maintenance of her export trade. 7. Prom the figures already given it will be apparentrshow important is the prosperity of the Anglo-Argentineishgroup of companies to the very large body of proprietors and manufacturers in the United Kingdom,Judging from the figures compiled by some 40 of the larger undertakings, the value of orders, exclusive of freight charges, placed in the United Kingdom by British companies to carry on their business in, or trade with Argentina, would account for nearly half of the export trade of the United Kingdom with that country.     These orders depend upon the prosperity and progress of that Republic;    any set-back there would therefore prejudicially affect industry and trade in the United Kingdom, especially in the heavy industries. &apos;s   8. Argentina&apos;s ability to purchase in this countrys.       depends on her being able to export the raw materials andfoodstuffs which represent her principal economic resources. This is also true of the British undertakings which by their nature cannot be withdrawn from her soil and which are therefore entirely identified with the prosperity of the country in which they operate.
of9.We believe that if the advantages of a century of constructive development are to be maintained, no difficulties beyond those common to all trading nations at this time should be placed in the way of a furtherance of mutual trade between the United Kingdom and the Argentine.We wish to express our considered view that Argentina offers as a whole one of the most valuable and expanding markets   open for the sale of those finished industrial products in which this country specialises.There is no country where more genuine ties of friend-ship with the United Kingdom exist than in Argentina, where so many British subjects have made their homes.We therefore respectfully suggest that after provision has.been made for Imperial requirements some special treat-ment for Anglo-Argentine trade should be granted.We have little doubt that if H.M. Government can intro-duce a plan by which Argentina can continue to find a market in this country, reciprocal advantages would be obtainable from the Argentine Government to the benefit of all concerned.Finally, we wish to place on record that this Deputation and the Anglo-Argentine interests which it represents hold themselves in readiness to supply any information to H.M. Government which it is in their power to provide.We have the honour to be* Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd.) A. Maxwell.Faringdon. R. Foster. Evelyn Baring. H.C Allen. Follett Holt, E.H. Vestey. J.C.
