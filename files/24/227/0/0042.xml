g[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITAFKIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. QJ\ &apos; COPY NO. /(32).TRAWLING IN THE MORAY FIRTH AND FIRTH OF CLYDE. &quot; Memorandum, by the Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries.As the principles at issue in the case of the Moray Firth and that of the Firth of Clyde are in essence the same, I propose, in dealing with the questions raised in thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, on this subject (CP.35 (32)) to confine my observations mainly to the Moray Firth.1. I recognise that the fishermen of the Moray Firthare a valuable, hardy and enterprising body of men, deserving every possible encouragement, and I am well aware of the difficult times through which they have passed and are passing, but I regret to find their claims in conflict with general interests.     Unfortunately any plan to exclude foreign trawlers from the Moray Firth may give rise to claims by other Nations, particularly Iceland and Norway, which would be difficult to resist, and if successful would exclude our trawlers from fishing grounds of far greater value.2.        Moreover, while I recognise the strength of the feeling in Scotland on this subject, I am also aware that such action as the Secretary of State for Scotland suggested sts would have grave political repercussions in England and Wales.3. It is proposed to give to the fishermen living onthe shores of the Firth what would amount Almost to an &quot;exclusive right of fishing.   I am bound to point out that they would thus be placed in a privileged position enjoyed by no other fisherman in the British Isles.4. I would remind my colleagues that the hroad questionof policy regarding territorial claims over so-called &quot;Historic inlets,&quot; was decided in 1923, when H.M. Government adopted the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on
the Limits of Territorial Waters, and submitted the Report to the Imperial Conference, by which it was approved.    In paragraphs 16 and 17 of that Report, which deal with claims to territorial jurisdiction over inlets and bays, the width at the entrance of which exceeds six miles,  it is laid down that the policy of the Empire should be to restrict such claims as muoh as possible, and it is indicated that the   tenability of such a claim would depend primarily upon the shape and degree of enclosure of the area of water in question, with special reference to the extent to which it penetrates into the land.     The Report was again considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee appointed for the purpose of formulating the British case to be presented to the Codification Conference of the League of Nations, which met at The Hague in March, 1930.    The principle of restricting 3ritish claims to territorial jurisdiction to a minimum was inherent throughout their Conclusions, which formed the basis of the instructions given to the Delegates of II.M. Government who attended the Conference.5.       It seems to me, therefore, that it would be quite impracticable to adopt the first of the three methods suggested in the memorandum of the Secretary of State for Scotland, which implies a claim to territorial jurisdiction over the whole of the Pirth, a wide, open bay, 73 miles across at the opening with an area of 1,800 square miles.6.     We should, I think, be somewhat embarrassed in now inviting Foreign Towers to enter a Convention defiling the Moray
Firth, and the Firth of Clyde as part of the exclusive fishery limits of the British Isles, the second method suggested in the memorandum of the Secretary of State for Scotland.   The Moray Firth lies within the area covered by the Horth Sea Fisheries Convention of 1882.   That Convention, in Article 2, defines the areas within which, the fishermen of each country are to enjoy the exclusive right of fishery.   Those areas are the waters within a distance of three miles from low water mark, and, as regards bays, the waters within any bay up to a line drawn three miles to seaward of a straight line drawn across the bay in the part nearest the entrance at the first point where the width doe3 not exceed ten miles.   If there wez*e anygeographical or historical claim to such exclusive rights in the whole of the Moray Firth, this claim should have been established in the Cenventi-en.   In 1882, however, only seven years before the enactment of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889, the Government of the day entered into a Cenventlon by the terms of which any claim to exclusive fishing rights beyond the three-mile belt outside a ten-mile bay line, and, &apos; a fortiori&apos;, any claim to territorial jurisdiction beyond that limit, were definitely ruled out*7.   The Secretary of State for Scotland, while he does not, I think, admit that the first two methods must be finally discarded, suggests &quot;as a compromise&quot; a third one, which is, to enter into a Convention under which foreign fishermen would be required to observe the restrictions now applied by H.M. Government to British fishermen in the two Firths.   He suggests that the case of the Moray Firth, and by analogy, of the Firth of Clyde, could be differentiated from all other cases where claims to reciprocity might be advanced, on the ground that in these two areas above has the Sovereign Power enforced against its own nationals regulations which it does not enforce againstforeign nationals.    But it is doubtful whether any of the Powers
concerned would be prepared to accept the view that, because Great Britain had for 25 years enforced certain regulations against her own fishermen In an area of international waters, she could justly claim the enforcement of the same regulations upon the nationals of other countries without allowing other countries to adopt analogous regulations within waters adjacent to their own coasts, and to enforce them against foreign visitors to those waters.   There is, moreover, in my opinion, little practical difference between this method and that of claiming exclusive fishing rights.8.   The present position In the Firth is admittedly unsatisfactory, but I think there is an alternative method of meeting it over and above those set forth by the Secretary of State for Scotland in paragraph 8 of his memorandum.    I suggest that we might discuss with the other Powers concerned an amplification of the North Sea Convention embodying further provisions for the regulation of the operations of fishing vessels, to prevent damage of one method of fishing by another.    Such regulations could provide, for instance, for the protection of anchored nets against damage by trawlers or other fishing vessels.   No serious difficulty should, I think, be encountered in securing the embodiment of satisfactory provisions to this end In any revision undertaken of the North Sea Convention;    and if the operation of that Convention were extended beyond the limits of the North Sea, analogous provision could be made in regard to the Firth of Clyde.    I am confident that the Admiralty would be prepared to make special arrangements for patrolling the Firth during the critical months.9. I have considered the report on this question of the Committee on the Fishing Industry of the Economic Advisory Council.   The Committee draw a double distinction between the case of the Moray Firth and that of the Firth of Clyde.   They
come to the conclusion that, on geographical grounds there Is better support for a claim to territorial jurisdiction in the Firth of Clyde than in the Moray Firth.    On practical grounds, however, they find advantage in the closure to trawlers of the Moray Firth, but little or none for the total closure of the Firth of Clyde.   They favour, therefore, the partial opening of the Firth of Clyde and the maintenance, if possible, of the closure of the Moray Firth to travelers. They Invite the Departments of State concerned (that Is primarily the Ministry and the Scottish Office) to consider the practicability of putting forward to the foreign Powers concerned proposals for achieving the latter object.   The Secretary of State for Scotland and I have discussed this question and it is because we have failed to reach agreement that we ask for the decision of the Cabinet.10.    To conclude,  I am afraid that I am obliged to resist any proposal to claim cr to seek in respect of the waters In question territorial jurisdiction or exclusive fishing rights, or a right of regulation, which amounts to much the same thing.    I am inclined to think, moreover, that, should H.M. Government advance the last-mentioned proposal, while it would probably be embraced with readiness, if not with eagerness, by some of the countries concerned, others would strenuously resist it.    Germany, Holland and Belgium, for example, have no bays as to which they could set up counter claims, and would see in the suggestions not the risk only of exclusion from the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde, but that also of exclusion from a number of large bays of similar geographical formation off Iceland and elsewhere. Their apprehensions -would be shared by the trawling Industry of Great 3ritaln, upon whom we depend for the bulk of our supplies of fish for the home market.(In&apos;ld)    J.G. stry of Agriculture and Fisheries.26th January, 1932.
