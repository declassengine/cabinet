Memorandum &quot;by the Mjnlster of Transport.Copy No. fj..&apos;. ..In accordance with the Cahinet Conclusion 1(J2) J, I have conferred with the First Commissioner of V/orks and have seen the Chairman of the Improvements Committee of the London County Council on the subject of the future of Waterloo Bridge.2.      I enquired whether the London County Council had given full consideration to the possibility of restoring Waterloo Bridge to a state of efficiency without altering its design or dimensions and constructing an additional bridge to the east of Somerset House (the Temple Bridge), and have received today a written report stating their attidude which is reproduced in the appendix to this memorandum.      It is adverse to the proposal.3.      In general, it must he admitted that there is much force in the statement of the &quot;demerits&quot; which they see in the scheme, although, as regards traffic, I think   that some advantage would be secured by the &quot; Temple1&apos; scheme as a northern access to the new &quot;bridge would he near the centre of the Aldwych traffic layout, instead of as at present at the extremely congested intersection of Wellington Street and the Strand.On the other hand, as the Council point out,  those interested in navigation would object strongly to an additional bridge in this position.The scheme would he costly.      Together with the cost of reconditioning the existing Waterloo Bridge,  the expenditure might amount to  5 millions in all.
u b4.     In these circumstances, it does not appear that the proposal can he further pressed.5.      I informed Sir Percy Simmons that the Government would not be able to make a grant of more than 60 per cent, of the cost of any approved scheme for dealing with &quot;Waterloo Bridge and thst, in accordance witjh the practice of the Ministry of Transport, a stipulation would he attached that the Council should take effective steps to secure a proper architectural design and should submit their proposals for approval from the technical and other points of view.     he readily gave me an assurance that the Council would for the purpose of advising them and carrying out the work, associate an eminent engineer and an architect of high standing and repute.     He further agreed that, at a later stage, it might be advisable for the Council to give the Royal Commission on Pine ivrts an opportunity of commenting upon the design proposed to be adopted for the new bridge, but did not think this co-operation should go the length of giving the Royal Oommision any right of veto.In view of the strong opinions expressed by the Cabinet, Including the First Commissioner of &apos;0forks, against the proposal to reconstruct Waterloo Bridge for four lines of traffic, I did not allow Sir Percy Simmons to think that the Government would be prepared to contribute any grant to such a scheme.      I mention this because on Friday last statements appeared in the Press implying that the London County Council will not arrive at any decision as to their course of action until they have heard from the Government what our intentions are.      I assume that the Government does not wish to put itself in the position of actually vetoing any proposal for reconstructing Waterloo Bridge for four lines of traffic.      I, therefore, propose to inform Sir Pert*y Simmons confidentially

This would &quot;be subject to the Council giving an undertaking to act under proper architectural advice.The grant from the Road Fund would he 60 per cent, of the approved cost of an approved scheme.As the London County Council meets on Thursday next I propose to inform Sir Percy Simmons to the foregoing effect on Wednesday afternoon.The First Commissioner of &quot;Works concurs.(Intld)   P.J.P.
APPENDIX.9 0 a london COUNTY COUNCIL,C.I.C.The County Hall,Westminster Bridge,8.E.1.E. 324.25.18th January, 1932.Sir,Waterloo Bridge.In accordance with the promise given by the Chairmanof the Improvements Committee of the Council at his conference with the Minister of Transport on the 1ifth instant, I enclose a statement showing the demerits of the suggested scheme to construct a new Temple Bridge and to recondition Waterloo Bridge, each bridge to be used for one-way traffic only.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(sgdc)    MONTAGUE H. COX.Clerk of the Council.The Secretary,Ministry of Transport, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,
9 or*J O \JLONDON   COUNTY   COUNCIL.TEMPLE AND WATERLOO BRIDGES.Demerits of the suggestion to construct a new Tenvple Bridge and to recondition Waterloo Bridge, each bridge to be used for one-way traffic only.Navigation - The new suggested Temple Bridge (running from opposite the eastern arm of Aldwych) would be a very short distance from Blackfriars and Waterloo Bridges - only about 625 yards from the former and about 3.55 yards from the latter.     On this reach of the river there are special difficulties of navigation and any obstruction of the fairway Is open to serious objection on navigational grounds.     The Port of London Authority and the users of the river would no doubt strongly oppose any proposal which would interfere with navigation.     In order to meet the navigational difficulties it would probably be necessary to design a bridge with no more than one, or at most, two piers in the river.The adoption of the suggestion for two one-way traffic bridges would not remove the objections of river users to the existing Waterloo Bridge.     Representations have been made on behalf of the navigating interests that Waterloo Bridge, with the narrowest arches of any bridge on this part of the Thames set across the river just where it turns at right angles and the current sweeps round in a continuous curve, offers at present the most serious obstacle to navigation which has to be met anywhere in the tidal reaches. If Waterloo Bridge were reconstructed with not more than five arches over the river, the river traffic would be assisted.
Traffic - All traffic passing on to the new Temple Bridge, except that passing from the east, would cut across the east to west traffic along the Strand.     The cross river traffic would consequently necessitate two hold-ups of traffic only a short distance apart - at each end of Aldwych - instead of one hold-up, as under the present system of traffic control.On the south side   the cross river traffic is at present controlled at one point - the intersection of Waterloo Road and York Road - Stamford street.     The construction of a second bridge would introduce one or more additional intersection of north to south traffic with east to west traffic, and this new problem would have to be dealt with.Amenities of the Embankment - The new Temple Bridge would have to be carried over the &quot;victoria Embankment at a distance of only about 335 yards from Y/aterloo Bridge.     This additional bridging over of the embankment would detract from the amenities of the thoroughfare at this point.The overcoming of the navigational difficulties referred to above would present the aesthetic difficulty of designing a bridge of only two or three openings which would be in keeping with adjacent bridges, particularly Waterloo Bridge which has nine arches.Time for tcompletion - Parliamentary powers would be required for the construction of the new bridge.      It would not be possible to obtain these powers until late in 1933* Allowing for this fact, it is probable that some six to eight years would elapse before the new bridge would be available for traffic.The time required for the reconstruction of Waterloo Bridge to take six lines of traffic would be from three to four years.
9 ej *7- *Csptial Coat -   Detailed estimates of a new Temple Bridge have not been prepared, but it was estimated in 1925 that the cost of the scheme, including approaches and rehousing, would he of the order of  p,500,000.      This estimate was on the basis of the construction of a oridge of 30 feet in width and approaches 100 feet in width.  .   If the use of the bridge were restricted to south-bound traffic (Waterloo Bridge being reconditioned to take north-bound traffic) the cost of the works would be reduced, as a bridge of less width would suffice.On the other hand, several new buildings have been erected since 1925 which would probably be interfered with in connection with the construction of the approaches.     koreover,It would probably be&apos;deemed necessary to provide traffic-circuses at the intersections of the bridge approaches with important roads.     For these reasons, the rough estimate for property prepared in 1925 would have to be materially increased.It will consequently be seen that the cost of constructing the new Temple Bridge would probably exceed  3,500,000, even if it were constructed of a width sufficient to take only one-way traffic.The estimated cost of rebuilding Voterloo Bridge in its present form by taking down and reconstructing all the bridge, except the abutments and perhaps the first pier from the north, all of which would be otherwise dealt with, is  988,000.The total cost of carrying out the suggestion of constructing a new Temple Bridge and reconditioning Waterloo Bridge, each to take one-way traffic only, would therefore probably exceed  if, 500,000.-The estimated cost of reconstructing Waterloo Bridge, with fewer spans than at present, to take six lines of traffic, is  1,295,000.
i 9 *? o-  kr -Annual cost - The e st:Lmated^cc^t--o m2aJjrtai^^ steel bridge in the neighbourhood of Waterloo Bridge, allowing., for repainting the bridge every fifth year and repaving   the carriageway every fifteenth year, is  2f,500 a year.The cost of maintaining a stone bridge, allowing for repaving   the carriageway every fifteenth year:, would be approximately  ^,000 a year.Tne total estimated cost of maintaining two one-way bridges is, therefore,  J,500 a year, whereas the cost of maintaining a new steel Waterloo Bridge is  4,500 a year.The debt charges, during the period (60 years) of repayment, would obviously be very much heavier If the Temple Bridge were provided than if a new Waterloo Bridge were constructed to take six lines of traffic.Conclusion -   It will, therefore, be seen that in comparison with the scheme for reconstructing Waterloo Bridge to take six lines of traffic, the proposal to construct a new Temple Bridge and to recondition Waterloo Bridge, each bridge to take one-way traffic only, possesses serious demerits from the points of view of navigation, traffic and time required for completion.     Apart from these considerations, however, the increased cost of construction and maintenance -would appear to prohibit the adoption of the scheme for two one-way traffic bridges.(Qgd) Montague II. Cox. Clerk to the Council.The County Hall, S.32.1.18th January, 1952.
