LuxTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S gOVERMMEKT.C7P716(3S) COPT NO. .3__CABINET UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT - ANOMALIES REGULATIONS.MEMORANDUM   BY    THE    MINISTER    OF    LABOUR.1.      In accordance with the usual procedure all disallowancesunder these Regulations have been imposed either by the Court of referees or by the Umpire.    The figures are as follows:Coarts of JReferees Umpire(up to 14th (up to 5th January,December, 1931). 1932).Allowed. Disallowed. Allowed.      Disallowed.seasonal workers 5,676 16,307                                19                   17 Week-endWorkers 394 1,315                                  1                     6 MarriedWomen 22,169 1293638                              209                 231Some of the decisions of the Umpire relate to &quot;test&quot; cases and cover a number of other cases.2.     The fact that disallowances are imposed by local Courts of Referees all over the country means that a certain lack of uniformity in decisions is inevitable at- the outset.    The possibility of Appeals to the Umpire ensures that in time the general principles on which the Courts act are uniform but there will always be some local divergencies.    As the disallowances by Courts of Referees -given above are being reviewed in the light of the Umpire&apos;s subsequent decisions the figures do not necessarily represent the final position.3, Regulation I. Highly paid short time and casual workers., The Anomalies Bill as introduced sought to enable effect to be given to the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Unemployment1, /Insurance
Insurance relating to casual and short time workers receiving high earnings for one, two or three days per week.    The Bill was altered in parliament in such a way that it has not been possible to make any effective Regulations on this point. 4.      Re tru I a t iouj^   Seasonal workers.    Some complaints have been received as to the effect of this Regulation on certain classes such as salmon fishers on the Tay and elsewhere, brick makers, fishworkers, ice cream sellers and hotel etc. workers in certain districts.    The point has also been made that persons who take seasonal work rather than remain idle may lose the benefit of their contributions.      Umpire&apos;s decisions have,  to some extent, met this latter difficulty.    With regard to the complaints generally,  it may be pointed out that the view has been taken deliberately that persons who only work during a particular season ought not to get Benefit in respect of periods when they do not normally work and that where the season does not ordinarily extend over more than eighteen weeks in a year exemption from paying contributions may be claimed.    The whole question as it affects seasonal workers will, however, be carefully watched. 5.      Regulation 5.    Week-end workers.    So far as has aoreared hitherto the Regulation is effective for the purpose for which it was intended and does not inflict undue or avoidable hardship, o.     Regulation 4.    Married, women.    Figures under this Regulationfor the whole country are given above in paragraph 1. The following table gives figures for certain specific areas.Live Register,i Claims to benefit dis-j allowed by Courts of \ Referees 21st October j to 14th December, 1931.Number of Married Women on Register19th Oct. 1931.7 th Dec. 1931.Number.percentage of register on 19th Oct. 1931.Western Division &apos;f Great Britain108,000! 170,50075,00095,00035,51194,12733-/2./The
The operation of this Regulation has shewn that there has been pretty general acceptance of the principle underlying it. The complaints have related mainly to districts and industries (particularly the cotton industry)  in which married women are normally employed.    The Regulation provides that regard should be had to the industrial circumstances of the district in which the claimant resides.   At the outset there was inevitably some diversity in the interpretations on which different Courts of Referees based their decisions and with regard to this particular provision some of the Lancashire Courts adopted a stricter interpretation than the Umpire was prepared to endorse.    The Umpire has iiiterpreted the expression &quot;industrial circumstances&quot; as meaning that, speaking generally, women who have been employed in the cotton trade since marriage will not be disallowed benefit merely because owing to incus trial depression the prospect of their obtaining employment in their normal occupation is somewhat remote. It should be pointed out that the Umpire has explained that this does not mean that industrial depression can never be a factor in the case.    Furthermore,  in interpreting this Regulation the Umpire will be guided, very largely, by the view of the Court of Referees for the locality in which the claim arises since they may be presumed to be familiar with the local circumstances.    This means that there may still be complaints of lack of uniformity as between one district and another but the decision just referred to will certainly help to clarify the position and the figures of disallowances of Courts of Referees given above may be expected to be altered after cases have been reviewed in the light of this, decision,,7.      It is worthy of note that taking the -Anomalies Regulations generally there has been nothing in the way of a press campaign against them.    I should perhaps mention that representations of a general nature have been received from the Trades Union Congress General Council.    Beyond mentioning the point referred to in Paragraph 6 above the General Council do not specify the points3. /on
oil which they think the Regulations require amendment and their representations probably need not he taken too seriously.8.      In accordance with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee the working of the Regulations will he carefully watched, and later on, in the light of experience,  it will be necessary to decide whether any amendment of the Regulations is required; but it is as yet too early to express a final view.(Intld. ) II.B.11th January,  1932a4n
