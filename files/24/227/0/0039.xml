0 ( Qb DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CRET,39 (52)COPY NO*      /CABINET,COMMITTEE ON THE HOME WHEAT QUOTAREP OR]lo At their Meeting cn January 20th, 1938,(Cabinet 4 (32) Conclusion 5) , the Cabinet agreed, that aCommihtee composed of  The Lord President of the Council      (In the Chair) The Lord Privy seal the Secretary of State for the Colonies The Secretary of State for War The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and       The Secretary of State for scotland should examine the proposals contained in the Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (cp 22 (32)) andreport as to how far they considered them to be the bestscheme that could he devised in order to enable a system efa wheat quota to he applied to British farmings2. Y/e have carefully examined the proposals containedin CPU  22 (32)  in the light of further Information and explanations given to us by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and his Officials,     We unanimously recommend the Cabinet to adopt these proposals as the foundation for the proposed home wheat quota Bill,3C We have considered the two matters mentioned inparagraph 8 of CP. 22 (32) viz,  (l)  the maximum quantity of1 o
wheat (paragraph 1 of the plan) and (2) the basic price (paragraph 15 of the plan).As regards (i), we think that the figure of 6 million quarters of wheat should be inserted in the Bill as fixing the maximum limit of the charge to be levied in any one year in respect of the quota.As regards (2), we recommend the insertion in the Bill of 45/- per quarter of 504 lbs. as the &quot;basic price&quot;.4. we think it most important that an undertaking shouldbe obtained from the milling industry that the industry will not add to the price to the flour consumer any amount in excess cf the amount of the quota levy.    If a voluntary undertaking to this effect cannot be obtained from tho industry, we suggest      that consideration should be given to the practica-bility of a requirement being compulsorily imposed upon the industry by means of a provision in the Bill.5. The question of the imposition of a statutory time limit for the scheme has been before us, but the balance of opinion was in favour of no time limit for the duration of the scheme being inserted in the Bill.6. We- accordingly recommend the Cabinet -(l)    To adopt the proposals contained inC.P. 22 (32) as the foundation of the proposed home wheat quota Bill.(2)    To authorise the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries to include in his draft Bill the figure of 6 million quarters as themaximum quantity cf wheat&apos;  and the figure of 45/- as the &apos;basic price&apos;, and also to include in the Bill (failing a voluntary undertaking by the milling industry) the requirement that a miller shall not add   to the price to the flour consumer any amount in excess of the amount of the quota levy, if, on consideration, such a course is found to be practicable.
OOrt(5) That no time limit for the duration of the scheme should he inserted in the Bill.(4) To authorise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to release for public information a summarised version of the home wheat quota plan, in the form approved by the Cabinet *Signed on behalf of the CommitteeSTANLEY BALDWIN,CHAIRMAN,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 26th January, 1952 c3
