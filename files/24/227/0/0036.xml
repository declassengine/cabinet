REPORT.Introductory.1. AT their Meeting on the 14th December, 1931 (Cabinet 89 (31), Conclusion 7), the Cabinet agreed &quot;That a Committee, composed of representatives (e.g.; Parliamentary Under-Secretaries or others) nominated by the following Ministers The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Transport,should consider the machinery and organisation now used. e.g., Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, &amp;o, which are in process of termination, for providing work for the unemployed, and report what amendments in it should be made or alternatives set up. They should bear in mind that the number of persons for whom it is impossible to find permanent employment will probably remain at a very large figure, which is not likely to be reduced materially, for some years to come. They should consider the work done by the Lord Privy Seal as employed by the late Labour Cabinet for stimulating and co-ordinating efforts to create work.&quot;2. It was subsequently decided that the President of the Board of Education and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should also be represented on the Committee, which was duly constituted as follows :  The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, The Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.I. Retrospect.3. Before setting out the present position in regard to the organisation and machinery for providing work for the unemployed, it may be of value very briefly to review the efforts of the past eleven years in this direction. The first Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed in August 1920 in consequence of the collapse of the post-war boom. The general impression at that time was that the trade slump would be short-lived like pre-war trade depressions and the remedies applied were mainly of a short-term character. They fell into two classes : (1) Schemes which aimed directly at the revival of trade and industry in its normal channels, such as the Trade Facilities and the Export Credits schemes;(2) Schemes for the provision of additional, employment on public works, including roads and works carried out by local authorities and public utility companies other than railways.4. With the persistence year after year of a high rate of unemployment in most of the basic industries, the true significance of the post-war depression gradually came to be recognised, and increasing attention was paid to the development of long-term schemes of economic reconstruction. While the policy of public works was continued with increased vigour, active steps were taken to develop the electrical industry, to increase permanent employment on the land by afforestation and land settlement, and to promote oversea settlement.   By
1926, however, doubt had arisen as to whether the continuing heavy expenditure on public works was not prejudicing the recovery of the depressed industries, with the result that no net addition was being made to the sum total of employment. The pressure for further new schemes accordingly relaxed. The tendency to seek a remedy rather by the stimulation of industry in its normal channels led eventually to the derating of industry and agriculture under the Budget of 1928, but public works came once more to the forefront at the beginning of 1929 as part of a new policy of transferring surplus population from the depressed areas. This proved of considerable value in providing an outlet, especially for the younger unemployed in these areas, until the general spread of the depression practically brought the policy to a standstill. In the meantime a new Government had assumed office and was not only pressing vigorously forward with extended schemes on lines previously followed, but had commenced a searching examination, and wherever possible the application of further remedies, both long-term and short-term.5. In this connection a new departure was made in Government organisation. Formerly each successive Government had appointed a Cabinet Unemployment Committee to co-ordinate the independent activities of the several Departments, but in 1929 Mr. J. H. Thomas, as Lord Privy Seal, was &quot;charged with the special duty of dealing with unemployment.&quot; Three other Ministers designated by the Cabinet, together with the permanent heads of the Departments mainly concerned, formed a consultative Committee and a small secretariat was collected.6. The short-term remedies that were adopted followed in the main the general lines of previous schemes, the more important new features being the extension of development grants to railway companies in this country and the introduction of a wholly new scheme of grants for Colonial development. The development of a long-term policy, however, encountered serious difficulties with the rapid onset of the world depression, which, for instance, reduced even the existing scheme of oversea settlement to negligible proportions. The possibilities of expanding employment in home industry were actively explored and much valuable information was collected by a series of enquiries under the direction: of the Committee of Civil Research, and its successor, the Economic Advisory Council, into the position of particular industries. These enquiries indicated that the causes of the continuing depression lay to some extent in inefficient marketing, but mainly in the high level of the costs of production. Leaders of industry and finance who were consulted attributed this high level partly to&apos; factors outside the control of industry, especially high taxation, and partly to deficiencies in organisation and equipment, and, as a result of these consultations, a new financial machine for the furtherance of industrial reorganisation was constituted in the Bankers&apos; Industrial Development Company. The Committee understand, however, that, up to the present, economic conditions* have been so adverse that opportunities for the profitable employment of new capital in industry have been practically non-existent.7. After a years experience of the working of the new Cabinet organisation it was decided in June 1930 to revert to the conditions of departmental responsi-bility for unemployment questions similar to those which had existed under previous Governments. A Panel of Ministers was appointed under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister to formulate policy and co-ordinate departmental action with the assistance of a Secretariat of specially selected Civil Servants under Sir John Anderson. In accordance with this policy, Govern-ment co-operation with the reorganisation of industry became a matter for the President of the Board of Trade, Sir Horace Wilson being appointed to assist him as Chief Industrial Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.8. Other aspects of a long-term policy engaged the. special attention of Ministerial and other Committees under the Labour Government as under previous Governments, e.g., Cabinet Committees on Agriculture, Trade Policy and Production of Petrol from Coal.* Obstacles in the way of large-scale industrial reorganisation are belief in the advantages (initiative, personal enterprise and flexibility) of the small unit, the reluctance of proprietors and creditors to write down the nominal value of their assets, and the unwillingness of the stronger concerns to merge their interests with those whom they regard as in a loss sound position.[6484] b 2
9. The trend of opinion among Ministers and others closely engaged in the study of the problem was already away from the policy of public works when the May Committee in July 19.31 emphasised the seriousness of the financial position. In the May Report many of the unemployment works then being carried out were criticised on the ground that the economic benefit to be obtained therefrom was too small and too remote to justify the heavy cost. The Committee recommended extensive economies in this field and these were in the main approved by the National Government.II. The Present Position of Public Works   Schemes.(a) Roads.10. Apart from any savings effected in the current financial year, the authorised reduction of  7,865,000 in the estimate of Road Fund grants for 1932-3 represents an estimated curtailment of expenditure of between  13 and  14 million in that year.11. The total of road improvement schemes approved since June 1929, which stood on the 24th August last at  62-9 million, had by the 30th November last been reduced by postponements and cancellations to  56-6 million, and a number of other major schemes amounting to  9-5 million, which had not yet reached the stage of formal approval, were also dropped for the time being. This total reduction of expenditure by  15-8 million involves a reduction on Road Fund liabilities of  11 million spread over several years. It is not yet possible to say whether further curtailment of the approved programmes may be necessary in order to secure the required cash reduction of  7,865,000 in Road Fund disburse-ments in 1932-3. On present estimates the outstanding liabilities of the Fund for improvement schemes on the 31st March next will stand at  23 million and apart from any new schemes that may be accepted under future annual programmes these may be assumed to involve the payment of grants amounting to :  8-5 million in 1932-33.  7 - 5 million in 1933-34.  5 million in 1934-35.  2 million in 1935-36.The actual rate of expenditure will depend on the rate at which the several highway authorities carry out the works.12. The total number of men directly employed on road improvements of all kinds stood at about 41,000 in August last; 32,000 at the end of November and by the end of March is estimated to have fallen to about 25,000. Any estimate of employment at the 31st December next is necessarily very speculative, but it will probably be in the neighbourhood of 15,000, i.e., directly employed. Prior to 1929 the number of men directly employed on road improvement work was approxi-mately 12,500. Indirect employment provided by road works is usually estimated as roughly equivalent to the employment on the site.(b) Schemes under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929.13. Payments from the Road Fund even large grants towards capital works have always been made from revenue, and the opportunities for immediate economy are consequently large. Grants under the Development Act, however, whether made under Part I to Public Utility Companies trading for profit (on the recommendation of the Lewis Committee) or under Part II to local authorities and public utility companies not trading for profit (on the recommendation of the St. Davids Committee) have in the main taken the form of contributions towards the loan charges incurred by the grant-receiving body. The liability of the Exchequer in respect of such schemes extends over a considerable period and the immediate effect of any curtailment of activities is proportionately reduced. The powers granted by the Development Act expire as regards new approvals in August 1932.
St. Davids Committee.14. Dealing first with, the Unemployment Grants Committee, which prior to 1929 covered a great part of the field then assigned to the new Committee under Part I, the total capital value of works assisted since the original appointment of the Committee in December 1920 amounts to  191 million. Since the 1st June, 1929, approvals have amounted to  79,163,000. During the past eleven years the terms of Government grants have been repeatedly improved in order to attract more schemes. The original offer was a grant&apos;of one-third of the wages of additional men employed (representing in the average case about 15 to 20 per cent, of the total cost). The rates of grant in force in July last were equivalent, in the case of non-revenue-producing schemes, to more than 60 per cent, of the capital cost and in the case of revenue-producing schemes to about 25 to 35 per cent. Offers of grant in 1931 on these terms were conditional on work being actively commenced by the 31st December, 1931.15. Following on the report of the May Committee, the maximum rates of grant have been reduced for non-revenue-producing schemes to about 25 per cent, and for revenue-producing schemes to about 19&quot; per cent. The total of new approvals on the reduced*terms for the quarter ended the 31st December, 1931, was about  6 million. As the condition of commencement by the 31st December, 1931, has been maintained subject to one month&apos;s extension in certain cases, new approvals have now practically ceased.16. Even before the falling off in hew approvals the number of men directly employed had shown a tendency to decline. The peak figure of 57,720 was reached in the second quarter of last year. At the 31st December, 1931, some 1,100 schemes were in operation giving direct employment to about 47,000, and it is estimated that at the end of 1932 these numbers will have been reduced to 200 schemes and about 15,000 men directly employed. As in the case of road works, the total employment provided is usually estimated at double the direct employment.17. The charge falling upon the State in respect of schemes approved by this Committee has steadily grown since 1920, and for the year 1932-33 is estimated at  3,600,000. Apart from any possible further developments, the charge will increase to about  5 million by 1933 and not begin to fall till 1937, not finally running out until 1963.Lewis Committee.18. While the total value of schemes approved by this Committee since its appointment in August 1929 has amounted to  40,300,000, the much smaller number of schemes concerned (186 as against over 4,200 approved during the same period by the St. Davids Committee) has enabled much more detailed considera-tion to be given to the merits of each scheme. In general the rates of grant have been subject to the maxima in force for the time being for revenue-producing schemes dealt with by the St. Davids Committee. No time limit has been imposed on applications under Part Tin view of the economic value of the schemes, but with the intensification of the depression opportunities for further profitable development of the public utility services have receded. Only  1,200,000 of new applications were submitted between the 24th August and the 31st December last,  1,100,000 relating to one scheme, and only three schemes of importance are now under consideration amounting in all to  6,700,000. The chief of these is an L.N.E.R. suburban electrification scheme estimated at  4,600,000, which is being-held in suspense pending the passing of the London Passenger Transport Bill. The conditions under which Part I schemes are carried out do not admit of any close estimate being made of the employment thereby afforded, but, on the lines adopted by the late Mr. Hartshorn, speaking as Lord Privy Seal in the House of Commons on the 12th February last, it may be estimated that the total employ-ment, direct and indirect, on these schemes, which is now probably at a peak figure of over 50,000, will have fallen by the 31st December next to a little under 15,000.19. The Exchequer charge in respect of schemes already approved is estimated for 1932-33 at  650,000 and will reach its maximum of  1,450,000 in ,1934-35 and thereafter fall away until the maximum statutory period of 15 years for any loan expires in 1950.[6484] &quot; 3
(o Colonial Development Act.20. Compared with the foregoing schemes that of the Colonial Development Act is of minor importance, the total cost of schemes recommended for approval up to August last being  9-4 million of which  3-6 million was to be spent in the United Kingdom. Assuming that these schemes, like those under the Lewis Committee, are&quot; spread over 3 years, the usual ratio of 4,000 man years for  1 million of work would indicate an average employment value of about 5,000 men. Since August a few additional schemes have been approved, but economic difficulties of the Colonies have led to the abandonment of others. A limit of  750,000 per annum has now been placed upon the Exchequer grants to the Colonial Development Fund and it seems improbable that the volume of employ-ment afforded under the Act will show any notable variation during 1932.(d) Land Drainage, Water Supply, Harbours, &amp;21. In addition to the schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee schemes to the total of about  1,800,000 had been approved from the 1st June, 1929, to the 24th August, 1931, for capital grants by other Government Departments towards the improvement of land drainage and rural water supply, the reconditioning and extension of fishery harbours, &amp;c, provision for these grants being made on the relevant Votes. Since August 1931 many of these commitments have been cancelled or postponed on grounds of economy and new approvals are in the main limited to cases of proved urgency.Summary of Employment provided by Public Works Schemes.22. Summarising the estimates given in the foregoing paragraphs, it would appear that the total employment, direct and indirect, provided by the schemes therein referred to, which at the 31st December, 1931, was probably about 220,000, will by the 31st December next have declined to 75,000 or 80,000.(e) Housing.23. Although not considered as failing within the category of unemploy-ment relief works, housing has important reactions on employment and cannot be disregarded in this connection. As in the case of schemes under the Develop-ment Act, Government assistance to housing since the War has mainly taken&apos; the form of a contribution towards loan charges over a term of years, the period being originally 60 years, then 20 years, and now;; mainly 40 years, the responsibility for raising the necessary capital funds being left with the local authority and private house-builder. The aggregate Exchequer liability for the current year is estimated at  14,500,000, and the present value of the future accrued liability as at the 31st March last was about  218 million. In view of the fall in cost of building since the last revision of the Exchequer subsidy and the general downward movement of prices, the May Committee recommended a reduction in the rates of subsidy from April 1932, but this recommendation was not accepted and under existing legislation the next revision Will take place in October 1933. In the meantime it has been decided to concentrate on the provision of small houses for which there is a large unsatisfied demand that is not likely to be met by private enterprise.24. In the year ended the 30th September last, the total number of houses built in England and Wales was 195,000 and in Scotland about 11,000. Of these private enterprise had provided in England and Wales 131,656 houses (all bur. 1,866 being built without subsidy). In,Scotland, although the subsidy provisions of the 1923 Act are there still in operation, the total contribution of private enterprise.was only about 3,000. In the calendar year 1930 it had been 4,546, of which 3,138 were built with the aid of subsidy, and 1,408 otherwise. More recent returns show a, considerable expansion in subsidised building by private enterprise in Scotland, the number of such houses under construction at the 30th November last being 3,007 as against 1,023 the year before. It remain-clear, however, that the main contribution towards the improvement of the housing of the working classes in Scotland must, for some time to come, continue to be made by local authorities.
In November last the total number of State-assisted houses in various stages between approval and completion stood at 80,293 in England and Wales as compared with 70,677 in 1930. 19,479 in Scotland as compared with 13,847 in 1930.The improvement in the position in Scotland is specially noteworthy. There are, however, indications in the number of applications now coming forward that this favourable position may not be maintained after next summer.III. Public Works as an Unemployment Policy.25. It will be obvious from the foregoing sections that the policy of public works for the relief of unemployment after being pressed in varying degree since 1920 has come to be deemed less appropriate to more recent conditions. It may be convenient at this stage to review the four main arguments generally advanced in favour of such a policy in the light of the experience that has been gained.   They may be briefly stated as (i) that it provides employment at full wages;(ii) that it affords an opportunity of using idle labour to increase theeconomic equipment of the country and therefore to improve its competitive position;(iii) that in a normal trade depression it tends to check the vicious circle of contracting demand and falling prices, and thereby to set in motion economic forces leading to a trade revival;(iv) that it maintains the individual, local and national morale.(i) Employment.26. Experience has shown that the proportion of the unemployed who can be found employment on public works is severely limited by considerations of age, sex, physique, locality, the difficulty of finding suitable works, but, above all, by cost. The attached diagram shows the total numbers of unemployed and those directly provided with work on State assisted relief schemes in each of the past seven years. (In addition, it has usually been assumed that these schemes have indirectly provided work for an equal number of men.) While the average yearly cost of unemployment benefit has been throughout under  50 a man, the cost of public works is generally estimated  500 a man directly employed, and if an equal number of men be assumed to be provided indirectly with employment, at  250 a man. Unless, therefore, the works themselves have an economic value on completion at least equal to four-fifths of their cost, the country is the poorer in its national wealth by their execution.(ii) National equipment.27. At the commencement of a trade depression there is usually a great variety of public works, which, if not already overdue, are likely to be needed in the near future for the efficient conduct of the nation&apos;s trade and industry, but as a depression becomes prolonged the works coming forward are less and less attractive economically. After eleven years of effort of this kind there seems to be good reason for thinking that the equipment of the public utility services of this country is in most fields in advance of any requirements of trade that can be expected in the nearer future, and that any shortcomings of this country in the matter of equipment lie rather in its productive industries. Against the advantage which results to industry from such works and many of the schemes which have been assisted in the past do little or nothing to improve its competitive position must be set the resulting debt burden involved, which falls in large measure upon industry.(iii) Trade Expaxasion.28. The expenditure of this country since 1924 on public works put in hand to.relieve unemployment, road improvements, and on subsidised housing (about  450 million) has exceeded  700 million.   The bulk of this sum has been raised
by loan, and, according to economic theory, would, in a normal trade cycle, have led to an expansion of credit with an upward trend of prices and beneficial reactions on industry and employment. It has, however, become increasingly apparent that the economic difficulties of this country since the War have not been clue to a depression of the familiar pre-war type. Any tendencies of this kind have been wholly outweighed by the operation of economic forces and other influences here and abroad, working in the contrary direction. It has been argued that the effect of this expenditure would have been much more marked had it been concentrated in a much shorter period, but eleven years of experience go to show that such concentration could only have been achieved by the dictatorial methods and wastefulness necessarily associated with war conditions.(iv) Morale.29. There still remains, however, the weighty argument of the effect of a public works policy in maintaining the morale of the unemployed and of the public generally. While such evidence as is available seems to indicate that the public works for the relief of unemployment have in the main been carried out hitherto with an efficiency not markedly inferior to that of ordinary-employment, there can be no doubt that a heavy rate of expenditure, stimulated by generous State assistance, has a strong contrary tendency. As regards the individual worker, the moral effect of a spell of employment on relief works is small compared with the inspiration given by a revival of hope of a return to normal work. The necessity for taking definite action to maintain his morale must be judged, therefore, very largely by the prospects of this hope being realised in the near future. In this connection it is important to bear in mind that, while the national position, considered as a whole, may not be unsatisfactory, a need may arise for special action to revive public confidence in particular areas.IV. Future Policy in regard to Unemployment Schemes.30. After reviewing the experience of the last eleven years and the present situation in regard to schemes of public works for the relief of unemployment, the Committee proceed, in accordance with their terms of reference, to submit some suggestions as to future policy in regard to employment schemes. The employment position in this country is dominated by the international situation generally and by fiscal policy both at home and abroad, and the unemployment policy of the Government must in the main lie in these fields.31. As regards the field of schemes specially directed to provide employ-ment, with which the Committee is more directly concerned, the difficult Budget position clearly vetoes any large additional charge upon the Exchequer; indeed, under present conditions, to withdraw more money from the taxpayers pocket in order to spend it on providing work would probably tend to reduce rather than increase the sum total of employment.32. The alternative of proceeding by way of loan has been pressed on many occasions, but it is not generally realised how largely this method of financing expenditure has, in fact, been adopted in recent years, both in regard to unemployment schemes and also in the case of housing; not, it is true, by a spectacular national development loan, but by loans raised by other parties on the promise of a State grant for a term of years. As already pointed out, the bulk of the expenditure of over  700 million on these services since 1924 has been met in this way; in addition, local authorities have raised considerable loans for the normal development of their services, especially trading undertakings. The total outstanding indebtedness of local authorities in England and Wales* at the 31st March, 1930, was  1,223 million, as compared with  658 million at the 31st March, 1921, an increase of  565 million. In recent years fresh loans have been contracted at the rate of about  100 million per annum, as against repayments of debt of about  30 million per annum.* The total outstanding indebtedness of local authorities in Scotland at the loth May, 1929,. yv&apos;as  187 million. Fresh loans were being contracted at the rate of about  8-\ million per annum,, as against repayments of debt of about  4 million per annum.
33. In present financial circumstances, when the vital issue of the sufficiency of the national income to maintain existing standards of life in this country is at stake, the Committee are strongly of the opinion that it is essential to reserve the capital resources of the nation for such developments as will definitely add to the national income. The heavy expenditure on public works of the past eleven years, considered merely as a means of providing employment, has shown itself unduly burdensome in relation to the very limited results obtained; considered as a means of improving the national equipment, it has not been sufficiently regulated by the consideration of a profitable return. Even in the sphere of public utility enterprise, there is reason to think that in some directions develop-ment has been carried to the point at which there is danger of it becoming uneconomic.Roads.34. Dealing first with road policy, the large improvement programmes launched since the War have given us a road system in this country probably superior to any in the world, and fully adequate in most respects to any demands that industry and trade are likely to make on it for the next few years. In so far as development proceeds beyond this standard, an unprofitable burden of maintenance is being imposed on the country. The Committee recommend, therefore, that the present restrictive policy in regard to road improvements should be maintained, such further road schemes as may prove to be urgently necessary being provided for in the annual budget of the Road Fund. In this connection the Committee understand that the Labour Government had before them certain road and bridge schemes of outstanding magnitude, as to the value of which there has been considerable doubt, but which have not as yet been the subject of a final decision. The Committee recommend that these schemes should be examined from the standpoint now suggested.Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929.35. The schemes falling within the scope of this Act are of great diversity, ranging from such valuable projects as the standardisation of electrical frequency on the North-East Coast to works of purely amenity value. After eleven years of operation, with increasingly generous Government grants, it is hardly to be expected that many more schemes of a genuinely profitable character will be coming forward at any rate, until trade conditions change materially for the better. At the same time the Committee are reluctant to recommend the scrapping of a useful piece of machinery. It is, however, in their opinion necessary to concentrate any State assistance that may be given in the future on schemes calculated to increase the national income which are not likely to go forward in the near future without some measure of State assistance. Within the strict application of these conditions, and subject to the limit of grants now being-offered under Part I of the Development Act, such assistance should be available either to public utility companies or. for the trading undertakings of local authorities, but, in order to secure uniformity of treatment, the Committee think that it would be desirable that all such schemes should be dealt with by one Committee. Without attaching any condition that the schemes shall be of substantial magnitude, which Would operate prejudicially against small under-takings, they contemplate that effort would be mainly concentrated on major schemes.36. The precise machinery for carrying out this recommendation will require some further consideration by Departments, there being at the present time one Committee operating under Part I of the Act and another Committee under Part II. It may prove possible to make interdepartmental arrangements whereby the one Committee now proposed may exercise both sets of functions, to the limited extent now contemplated, without the necessity of amending the Development Act. Subject to further consideration of this point of detail, they recommend that legislation be introduced to extend the Development Act for a further period of three years from August next, a statement of policy being at the same time made in the House of Commons as to the restricted use to be made&apos; of the extended powers.
37. In this connection a point of some importances should be noted as regards the method of providing the Government assistance in these cases. Hitherto, whereas grants from the Road Fund in aid of road improvements have always been paid in capital sums concurrently with the execution of the work, the States subsidies to capital works carried out under the Development Act have in the main taken the form of a contribution to loan charges, and have in consequence been spread over a term of years. Reference has already been made in Section II of this Report to the considerable liabilities which have in this way been thrown upon the national budgets of future years. Inasmuch as one of the main arguments, in present financial conditions, for the continuance of State subsidies to any scheme under the Development Act is the saving in unemployment benefit or transitional payments to be derived from the scheme, and the bulk of this saving will be obtained during the period of execution of the work, it is a matter for consideration whether the principles of sound finance do not require that the State grant to such a scheme should be provided over a like period, or whether such a course would too severely restrict the scope of the scheme.Colonial Development Act.38. Schemes under the Colonial Development Act are now being considered with special reference to the economic advantage accruing to this country. The Exchequer liability under the Act has already been limited to  750,000 per annum, and the present Committee do not propose any further restriction.The Immediate Future.39. Under the policy suggested in this section of this Report, the amount of employment provided by schemes of public works will, of course, rapidly diminish in the course of this year, and, apart from any further schemes that may be approved under the Development Act, will have fallen to roughly one-third of its present figure by the 31st December. The main trend of Government unemployment policy will have passed into the international and fiscal fields. The Committee are. however, reminded in their terms of reference that the number of persons for whom it is impossible to find permanent employment will probably remain at a very large figure for some years to come, and it is necessary to consider whether Government action can with advantage be initiated in other directions, if not to provide permanent employment, at any rate to maintain individual and public morale during this period.40. Inasmuch as, in default of other remedies, the nation as a whole has to maintain an unemployed man at an estimated average cost of roughly  50 per annum, the question has been asked on many occasions whether it would not be preferable to pay this, or such smaller sum as may suffice, to an employer to induce him to keep the man in work. Proposals of this character, however, have always been found, on careful examination, to break down&apos; on the difficulty of distinguishing between employment which would, and employment which would not, be available without a subsidy. Failure to maintain such a distinction would lead inevitably to subsidised wages and to the classic abuses associated with the poor law administration of a century ago.41. The desirability of turning any Government expenditure in connection with unemployment to the maximum possible benefit to industry has led from time to time to proposals for direct Government aid both towards the modernisa-tion of ordinary industrial equipment and also towards the development of new industries, or improved processes in industry. It has been represented that our industrial competitors in other countries have in great measure been able to re-equip their enterprises and initiate new developments without incurring any large permanent burden of debt charges, either as a result of the depreciation of the national currency or by using surplus profits, and this country may in the end be driven to make great sacrifices in order to put its own industries in an equal position. The matter is of the utmost importance to the future prosperity of this country and offers several lines of approach. In the years immediately following the War, the method of direct subsidy was extensively applied in the form of State guarantees of capital issues under the Trade Facilities Acts, but this method was eventually abandoned in 1926, after heavy contingent liabilities had been accepted by the Exchequer.   Development along the line of relieving&quot;
9 rhindustry from public burdens led to the Derating Scheme in 1928. Subsequent proposals in Parliament along the same lines related to income tax allowances in respect of replacements of plant. In September last an undertaking was given that relief in this direction would be afforded by the next Finance Act. The Labour Government endeavoured to secure a closer concentration of effort into the most effective channels, particularly by its investigations of the position of leading industries, the formation of the Bankers&apos; Industrial Development Company and its Land Utilisation Bill. Now the problem has passed to a Govern-ment authorised to explore every method including protective duties and quotas. These last have obviously great potentialities in regard to the establishment of new industries, though they may give rise to difficulties in other directions.42. How far it may be practicable to use these methods also to promote the reorganisation and re-equipment of existing industries will, no doubt, engage the attention of the Cabinet in the near future. Action along such lines may avoid many of the dangers inherent in any more direct form of State subsidy : at the same time the possibility of a resort to direct State assistance in some shape or other, for particular purposes, cannot be entirely ruled out. The case would be strengthened should the economic situation deteriorate and there be danger of a public agitation for the revival of the wasteful policy of extensive programmes of relief works, for it is important to remember that even a moderate degree of success in the revival of trade and industry in its normal channels will provide more employment and have an infinitely greater effect on the national morale than any extension of public works that may be practicable under present conditions. Without, therefore, expressing any sort of opinion as to the relative merits of proceeding, either generally or in particular cases, by means of tariffs, quotas or in other ways, the Committee recommend that the possibility of useful Government intervention in the reorganisation and re-equipment of industry and agriculture, and in the development of new industries and improved processes in industry be actively and continuously explored.43. From this point of view the Committee would also refer to proposals which, it is understood, have already been sent forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade to the President of the Board of Trade, for eventual submission to the Cabinet, with regard to the Export Credits Guarantee Department. These proposals, the Committee are informed, advocate that the Export Credits Guarantee Advisory Committee should be empowered, as in the past, to guarantee credits for a longer period than one year, subject to certain-conditions.44. It is also desirable to review the assistance which the Department of Overseas Trade can give in maintaining employment in the export trade of the United Kingdom. At a time when most countries, in their desire to secure a favourable balance of trade, are imposing restrictions upon importation and upon the remission of funds to pay for goods imported, it&quot; is essential that the fullest use should be made of the organisation provided by the Department at home and overseas, and the Committee would recommend that proposals submitted by the Department to enable it to assist exporters should be treated as matters of urgency.45. The Committee do not suggest that the foregoing constitutes anything like a complete or final survey of proposals for dealing with unemployment, otherwise than by means of general economic policy. The situation needs to be explored in more detail and should clearly be kept under review. This is not a matter for any one Department, and the Committee accordingly recommend that a standing Cabinet Committee should be appointed for this purpose. This Committee would co-ordinate departmental policy and submit recommendations for further State action, as may from time to time seem desirable. What form that action should take and the extent to which it should be applied must depend very closely on the course of employment. There are indications in some quarters that the recent improvement may not be maintained, but these are as yet much too uncertain to base any decisions of policy thereon. Pending further develop-ments in the industrial and economic position, however, the Cabinet Committee recommended above might with advantage give detailed consideration to any outstanding schemes awaiting decision, and to a number of proposals which have recently been submitted to the Committee on such matters as the extension of the
Ministry of Labour training and reconditioning centres, the Government building-programme, the provision of allotments and small holdings, land drainage. &amp;c. Some of these proposals are dependent to a considerable extent on a revival of trade, others are more in the nature of reserve plans to hold in readiness against a possible worsening of the position.46. The Committee feel bound, however, to stress, in conclusion, their conviction that, while the moral and economic effect of special action is this kind may in certain contingencies be valuable, it cannot be expected, especially in the present difficult financial conditions, to make any very large addition to the volume of employment. Apart from any beneficial effects of Government action in the wider spheres of fiscal policy and finance, both national and international, it seems clear that by far the most important direct contribution of the State towards assisting the unemployed must for some time to come consist of cash allowances, paid under the various regulations presently in force or as modified. These are now being reviewed by the ITolman Gregory Commission, and will be the subject of recommendations by that body at an early date.Summary of Suggestions.47. The Committee submit to the Cabinet the following suggestions as to policy: I. The Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act to be extended for three years and to be applied by one Committee only to developments calculated to increase the national income.II. Present policy in regard to road expenditure to be maintained.III. The possibility of useful Government intervention in the reorganisation and re-equipment of industry and agriculture, and in the develop-ment of new industries and improved processes in industry, to be actively and continuously explored.IY. A Standing Cabinet Committee to be appointed to watch developments, to co-ordinate departmental policy and to submit recommendations for further State action as may from time to time seem desirable. The Committee might proceed forthwith to examine in detail such proposals as have already been submitted to this Committee and any outstanding schemes on which no final decision has as yet been given. &apos;Signed on behalf of the Committee,WALTER ELLIOT, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, January 25, 1932.
