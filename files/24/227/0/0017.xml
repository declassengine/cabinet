REPORT.The French Draft for a Mediterranean Locarno.1. The only information which we have as to what the French may mean by a &quot;Mediterranean Locarno &quot; consists of a draft formula produced privately by the French Delegation during the Naval Conference of 1930, a translation of which is as follows : (a) The High Contracting Parties undertake to do nothing of a nature to affect prejudicially the rights at present enjoyed by each of them in the territories which come under its authority and the coasts of which are washed by the Mediterranean, or the exercise in the Mediterranean by a High Contracting Party and its nationals of the rights of free navigation recognised by international law.(b) If there should arise between certain of the High Contracting Partiesa difference in regard to the rights mentioned in Article 1, which it has not been possible to settle by diplomatic, arbitral or judicial methods and which has not formed the subject of a unanimous recom-mendation of the Council of the League of Nations, these Powers should concert with the other Contracting Parties with a view to an amicable settlement of this difference by such means as may appear appropriate in the circumstances.(c) In the event of the Council of the League of Nations deciding that oneof the High Contracting Parties has committed an act of aggression against another contrary to the provisions of the Pact of Paris of the 27th August, 1928, each of the other High Contracting Parties will furnish, in the Mediterranean, immediate assistance to the Power which has been attacked, and will take all measures which the Council may recommend with a view to the maintenance or re-establishment of the territorial status quo.If there has been a &quot;flagrant violation &quot; of the Pact of Paris, each of the High Contracting Parties will furnish this assistance as soon as it has been able to satisfy itself as to the necessity of immediate action. The High Contracting Parties will, for the rest, conform to the recommendations which the Council of the League of Nations may make unanimously, to the exclusion of the votes of the parties engaged in hostilities.(d) In the event of the rights mentioned in paragraph (a) being menacedby the aggressive action of any other Power, the High Contracting-Parties shall, in order to fulfil their obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations, communicate with each other fully and frankly in order to arrive at an agreement as to the most efficient measures to be taken jointly or separately to meet the necessities of the situation.The interpretation of this Draft Treaty.2. It is not known who the French intended should be parties to this proposed treaty; it might be those of the Mediterranean Powers who are Members of the League of Nations, or some of them, or Great Britain, France and Italy only, or even all Mediterranean Powers, including Turkey.3. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of the draft are based upon the Four Power Pacific Treaty signed at Washington on the 12th December, 1921. The references in the draft to the League did not figure in the Pacific Treaty because the United States was a party to it, and the last words of paragraph (a) (&quot; or the exercise .... international law &apos;&apos;) are also new.4.   Paragraph (c) is the Locarno element in the draft, but differs from that treaty in some respects.     There is nothing corresponding to the obligation in Article 2 of Locarno not to go to ,war, any such provision being presumably [6432] b 2
considered unnecessary in view of the conclusion of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, and similarly the 1&apos; guarantee&apos;&apos; applies, not as in Locarno to a breach of the obligation not to go to war assumed by the same treaty, or to a breach of the Versailles provisions about the demilitarized Rhineland zone, but to &apos;&apos; an act of aggression &apos;&apos; contrary to the provisions of the Briand-Kellogg Pact. In both cases it is for the Council of the League to decide whether a breach has occurred which brings the guarantee into operation, and the draft contains a provision for the case of a flagrant violation &apos;&apos; of the Pact which resembles the corres-ponding Locarno provision, though the wording- is different and does not make it plain that even in that case the matter is to be submitted to the Council of the League and the Parties are to act in accordance with its recommendations. The exact scope and effect of the last sentence of paragraph (c) are not very clear.5. The wording of the guarantee itself differs somewhat from the Locarno model. Under Locarno the guarantors are to &apos;&apos; come immediately to the assistance of the Power against whom the act complained of is directed &apos;&apos;; under the French draft each of the guarantors is to &quot; furnish in the Mediterranean immediate assistance to the Power which has been attacked &quot; and to &quot; take all measures which the Council may recommend with a view to the maintenance or re-establishment of the territorial status quo.&quot; The latter phrase does not correspond to any specific provision in Locarno, though Article 1 guaranteed the maintenance of the territorial status quo of the Franco-German and Belgo-German frontiers; it may be intended to be based upon Article 10 of the Covenant.6. The French draft does not contain anything equivalent to Article 3 of Locarno, providing for the settlement of all disputes between the parties in whose favour the guarantee is given, since paragraph (b) does not go nearly so far as the Locarno provisions. It may have been the French intention to leave this point to be dealt with by the Optional Clause and the General Act, in which case the question whether those instruments could be regarded as adequate for the purpose in view of the terms in which they were accepted by the States concerned, might require careful consideration.7.   Comparing our position under the French draft with that under Article 16 of the Covenant, it may be said that (a) Since the guarantee applies to all acts of aggression contrary to theBriand-Kellogg Pact, its scope is wider than that of Article 16 so long-as the amendments to the Covenant now under discussion are not adopted.(b) It is for the Council of the League to decide whether an act of aggressionhas been committed,which brings the guarantee into force, while under the Covenant each Member decides for itself whether Article 16 has come into play. On this point the French draft corresponds to the amendment to Article 16 which was adopted in 1921, but has never come into force.(c) Under Article 16 the Council recommends what effective military, navalor air force the Members of the League are severally to contribute. Under the French draft there is an obligation to &apos;&apos; furnish in the Mediterranean immediate assistance.&quot;(d) Under the French draft there is provision for immediate action prior to consideration by the Council in the case of &quot; Flagrant Violation &quot; of the Pact of Paris.Possible Forms of Mediterranean Locarno.8. In the preceding paragraphs we have given the only text of a Mediterranean Locarno which, so far as we know, has ever been drafted, and we have further attempted to examine the implications of this text. So far as we can see a proposal of this nature might take any one of the three following-forms :  (a) A pact inclusive of all countries bordering the Mediterranean; that is to say, a pact of an all-embracing nature so far as this region is concerned;
(b) A form of pact restricted to two or three or even four States; this might,perhaps, be called a Western Mediterranean Locarno, and might embrace France, Italy, Spain and ourselves;(c) A purely consultative pact on the lines of the Four Power PacificAgreement.9. Then there arises, also, the question of whether any such agreement could or should be confined solely to naval forces, or whether it would inevitably mean a commitment of an ell-embracing nature.Objects of a Mediterranean Locarno.10. Having defined to the best of our ability what is implied by the phrase &quot;Mediterranean Locarno,&quot; we can proceed to consider what would be the objects of any such agreement and what advantages, if any, might accrue to us as a result of our adherence; also and no less important, what commitments we might be expected to accept, and whether such commitments would extend beyond those which might arise either under Article 16 of the Covenant or the Treaty of Locarno.11. The main object of a &quot;Mediterranean Locarno&quot; is, we understand, to give France certain guarantees which might enable her to reduce the strength of her land and air and perhaps sea forces, and to facilitate naval disarmament among the naval Powers of the Mediterranean. The idea underlying the French proposal which was first mooted at the London Naval Conference and which we hear may again be raised at the Disarmament Conference is that if the safety of France&apos;s communications Avith North&quot; Africa can be guaranteed, thus ensuring the arrival of vital reinforcements whenever they may be required, then she might consider some reduction of the forces she maintains on French territory at the present time. In other words, the quid pro quo is to be some measure of disarmament. And if this is so, obviously no form of Consultative Pact would be of any value to France.12. The only countries able seriously to interrupt or menace France&apos;s North African communications at the present time are Italy and ourselves, and we assume, therefore, that it is France&apos;s idea to ensure our help i f she became involved in war with Italy, with the evident risk of its extension to Germany. Equally, of course, we should have to guarantee Italy against France, and, in view of the interest Spain has always taken in the idea of any &quot;Mediterranean Locarno,&quot; we could hardly expect that she would consent to be left out.What a &quot; Mediterranean Locarno&quot; would really Mean to Us.13. We have outlined briefly the objects which appear to have promoted the idea of a &quot; Mediterranean Locarno.&quot; We now propose to examine practically this proposal with a view to seeing Avhat, if any, real advantages might accrue, not only to us, but to the cause of World peace and the furtherance of disarmament.(a) Possible Commitments: (i) In paragraph 9 we asked whether any such form of pact could be restricted to naval armaments or whether it would inevitably involve a commitment of a general nature. We are of the opinion that it would be impossible to confine our assistance to the Navy only. In the first place, once a casus belli had arisen, we could hardly expect our enemies to be bound to confine their activities to naval warfare: if we were at war with Italy, it is not likely that she would refrain from attacking Malta with all the forces she could command. In the second place, aircraft now form part of the permanent equipment of a number of naval vessels, and having regard to the fact that the Mediterranean route lies within the range of shore-based air-craft, inevitably the Air Force would be committed as well. Thirdly, if Italy was faring badly on her land frontiers it would be difficult for us to stand by and do nothing to assist her. Again, if smaller Mediterranean Powers were involved the issues might be confined almost wholly to land warfare. [6432] &apos; B 3
(gFinally, it is hardly conceivable in these days, to think of going to war in sections. The Navy cannot operate without bases, for the defence of which military and air forces are required; ipso facto, if the Navy is at war so are the other two services.(ii) It seems to be clear, then, that any form of Mediterranean Locarno must involve the employment of the whole of our armed resources. What other commitments are involved? If the Pact was of an all-embracing nature, it is possible, even probable, that we should be drawn into any disputes between the smaller Mediterranean Powers. If Turkey executed a massacre of Greek citizens we should be expected to intervene; if Italy invaded Albania or Yugo-Slavia we could hardly expect to remain aloof. We might, in fact, lay ourselves open to a number of indefinite and ill-defined commitments, in circumstances under which normally we might have only an academic interest. As has been shown clearly in the opening paragraphs, the form of pact proposed demands immediate intervention in the &quot;case of flagrant violation and does not in that case interpose the buffer of the League Council between the committing of the outrage and the punishment thereof.(b) Advantages and Disadvantages.(i) The chief pre-occupation at the present moment is to find some method whereby France can be persuaded to reduce her armed forces. A Mediterranean Locarno is alleged to be one method, and it is well, therefore, to understand what such reductions might mean. It must be borne in mind in this connection that the Locarno Treaty was not followed by any considerable measure of disarmament. If the plan of a Mediterranean Locarno was adopted we should have to insist on some definite measure of disarmament in return. The first reinforcements France expects from North Africa total, we believe, 3 divisions in the first 3 weeks and a further 4 divisions in the course of the next 2 or 3 months, all of fairly high fighting value. France counts on getting over a considerable proportion of these reinforcements in a war with Italy, even if she were without any naval assistance and she requires them for her mobilisation plan. We cannot assume, therefore, that France would be willing to reduce up to a maximum of these figures, nor would the commitments which we should be asked to undertake procure anything at all comparable by way of reductions in return.(ii) There is admittedly a possibility that France and Italy might begin an intensive naval competition; on the other hand, in view of their respective financial conditions and the general economic outlook, it seems hardly possible to contemplate any such action on the part of either country. In any case, no increase can be made of vessels governed by the Washington Treaty till 1936. The position under the London Naval Treaty is not quite so satis-factory, however, and if neither France nor Italy can be got to restrict certain of their present demands in the categories of smaller naval vessels, we might be forced to invoke Article 21 of this Treaty. It does not seem, however, that we should gain any satisfactory return so far as naval construction -vis-a-vis France and Italy is concerned, because the saving in tonnage to us could not be held to balance, in any way, the wide commitments which we should have to undertake.(iii) It is suggested we might be able to prevent the creation of navies by the smaller Mediterranean Powers. So far, these fleets are paper fleets, and we should not, in any case, be caused serious anxiety, except, perhaps, in respect of submarines. The only country likely to demand a large fleet of submarines is Yugo-Slavia, and it must take some years for this fleet to materialise, even if her claims are admitted at the Disarmament Conference, which is by no means certain. It does not consequently appear that airy-thing we should be likely to gain in the direction of preventing the increase of small navies would make it worth accepting the commitments involved.(iv) Finally, it has been suggested that we might obtain guarantees of security for our communications in the Mediterranean. In the opinion of the Admiralty, however, we must safeguard these communications ourselves, and since, presumably, under a Mediterranean Locarno we should be either fighting against France or Italy, any guarantees we might get would be more or less neutralised.
The question of the safety of Mediterranean communications has been very fully investigated by the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Sub-Committee on National and Imperial Defence, of which Lord Salisbury was Chairman, first raised this issue in their report elated the 9th March, 1923 (C.I.D. Paper No, 436-B, Part II, paragraph 19 (e)), and the Committee of Imperial Defence, at their meeting held on the 4th February, 1924 (C.I.D. 180th Meeting, Minute 1 (Conclusion 10)), directed that a special enquiry should be conducted into this question. The Chiefs of Staff accordingly arranged for a special committee of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade to examine the problem of the safety of our Mediterranean communications, and this committee reported (C.I.D. Paper No. 596-B) not only on the position of trade with Mediterranean countries and through-trade using this route from the Far East, but also on bunkering facilities if the Mediterranean route should suddenly be closed. Their conclusions were that, if the Mediterranean route was to be closed, so far- as trade was concerned, no outstanding difficulties were likely to arise, with the exception of the supply of iron ore from S.E. Spain and Algeria, and long staple cotton from Egypt; and. further, that no great difficulties were likely to be anticipated in providing bunkering facilities for the alternative routes to the Mediterranean which would have to be used. These conclusions were approved by the Chiefs of Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 610-B) and by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their meeting held on the 22nd June. 1925 (C.I.D. 200th Meeting. Minute 2 (Conclusion 3)).It does not seem, therefore, that a Mediterranean Locarno would have any influence on the situation one way or another, but would merely add further entanglements without providing-any adequate return.The Position of the Dominions.14. In addition to the points we have set out above, there remains one vital consideration which cannot be ignored the attitude of the Dominions.15. It will be recalled that the Locarno Treaty was signed only by the United Kingdom Government, and the Dominions were expressly excluded. In this case, however, owing to the failure of the Anglo-American guarantee and the rejection of the Geneva Protocol, we had a sufficiently strong inducement to make us accept certain obligations, even though we could not carry the Dominions with us. The question arises, therefore, supposing it should be decided that the idea of a Mediterranean Locarno was sufficiently attractive to merit serious considera-tion, what attitude would the Dominions be likely to take up, and what, if any, benefits might they receive which could make any such proposal appeal to them ?16. The chief, and, indeed, perhaps the only inducement, might be a guarantee of communications through the Mediterranean; but, as we have already shown, we do not think any form of Mediterranean Locarno is going to help very much, if at all, in this respect. In any case, India is more affected than any Dominion, since neither Canada nor South Africa are directly concerned at all, and the routes via the Cape or Panama are quite satisfactory alternatives to the Mediterranean route for Australia and New Zealand. It is obvious, therefore, that there can be no particular attraction for the Dominions from this aspect.17. If, then, there is little or no gain to the Dominions, it is hardly likely that they will view the idea of a Mediterranean Locarno with any more favour than they regarded the original Locarno Treaty, and it is well, therefore, to consider the disadvantages of again undertaking commitments without them.18. In the first place, it is of importance that we should do nothing to weaken the prestige of our position as the leading member of a great and united Empire; at the forthcoming Disarmament Conference we shall need all the moral if not the physical strength we possess if we are to help to steer this Conference through the troubled waters that lie ahead of it. And, in any event, the success of our continued efforts for the maintenance of peace would lose much of their force without the solid weight of Dominion opinion behind them.19. In the second place, it is of vital importance that we should do nothing to weaken the spontaneous help that has always been so freely given in times of emergency.   If, unfortunately, the need should ever arise again, we
might find ourselves hard pressed if prompt assistance was not forthcoming from the Dominions; and if we had undertaken commitments Avhich we were suddenly called on to honour, but which the Dominions had previously refused to accept, the position might be very doubtful. This is a point of particular importance, because we cannot conceive that any Dominion Government would be willing to accept vague and undefined commitments, -without any satisfactory quid pro quo, which might lead them into a war for which their public had no sympathy, and which the Parliament at the time might refuse to sanction. And this consideration is not confined to the Dominions alone.20. Thirdly, the possibility of our becoming involved in a major war without the co-operation of the Dominions, and from which they were deliberated holding aloof, is not one likely to commend itself to British public opinion. It is difficult to imagine a contingency better calculated to weaken the bonds which link the Empire.Summary of Conclusions.21. The idea of a Mediterranean Locarno, although not new, has never before been fully considered, and we have therefore examined it in some detail. We have come to the conclusion that we cannot recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept any form of agreement of this kind involving military commitments, probably of an extensive nature. In return we should be unlikely to receive any adequate quid pro quo, either in the general cause of disarmament or in giving us any increased security of any kind. The reasons which have led us up to our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a) The obligations to be assumed under the proposed French draft appearto exceed those we have assumed under Article 16 of the Covenant or the Treaty of Locarno, in that the scope of the guarantee is wider, the Council of the League and not each individual member is to decide whether an act of aggression has been committed (except in the case of flagrant aggression &quot;), and there is a definite obligation to furnish immediate assistance.    (Paragraphs 1-7.)(b) It will be impossible to restrict any form of guarantee to purely naval forces, not only because it is not practicable to go to war with only one arm of the service in these days, but also because any such guarantee, being of a unilateral nature, would not bind the potential enemy or enemies by similar restrictions.    (Paragraph 13 (a) (i).)(c) The guarantees, to be of any value to France, would have to be of anall-embracing nature, and might, in consequence, lead to our being entangled in disputes in the Mediterranean zone in which normally our interest might be purely academic and confined solely to the maintenance of peace.   (Paragraph 13 (a) (ii).)(d) It is unlikely that France wrould agree to make reductions in her land forces which would be equivalent to the 3-7 Divisions she would be guaranteed from North Africa; a quid pro quo of small proportions in return for the commitments which we might have to undertake. (Paragraph 13 (b) (i).)(e) The advantages we might obtain for ourselves as a result of our guaranteeare too unsubstantial to counter-balance the responsibilities we might be called on to shoulder, because (i) It is unlikely, for financial reasons, that France and Italy willinaugurate an intensive naval construction competition in the Mediterranean; and, in any case, such a programme could not affect vessels limited by the Washington Treaty until after 1936.    (Paragraph 13 (b) (ii).)(ii) Any increase in the fleets of the smaller Mediterranean SeaPowers is at present problematical, and even if the claims which appear likely to be put forward at the Disarmament Conference are allowed, we shall only be affected to any considerable extent if Yugo-Slavia is permitted to construct
a fleet of submarines. Any likely restrictions of the smaller navies is consequently not worth the commitments involved. (Paragraph 13 (6) (iii).) (iii) No additional security would seem to be provided for our sea communications in the Mediterranean, and if they should be threatened at any time we have practicable alternative routes.   (Paragraph 13 (b) (iv).)(/) It is unlikely that any of the Dominions would be willing to join with us in signing any form of Mediterranean Locarno, especially as we are unable to discover any sufficient benefits which might act as an inducement to them to accept the commitments involved; and we feel that it is vitally important, for a variety of reasons, to take no action which might either tend to create a cleavage between ourselves and the Dominions, or to diminish our prestige as the leading member of a united Commonwealth.
