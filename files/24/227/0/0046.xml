At the meeting of the Cabinet on Friday 22nd January, 1932, the proposal was made  (Cab. 7(32) Conclusion 4) that the Report of the Agricultural Policy Committee (CP. 21(32)) should be withdrawn until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had submitted to the Cabinet his proposals on the Balance of Trade, when the Report could be re-examined in the light of the Cabinet decision on general Balance of Trade policy.    This memorandum directs attention to those questions of agricultural policy which still require a decision of the Cabinet.2. The Report of the Agricultural Policy Committee (CP. 21(32)) is divided into two parts dealing respectively with short range and long range policy.   The Committee recommend in regard to both agriculture and fisheries that the Governments short range policy should be one of tariffs on imports, and they express the opinion that if there is to be a general tariff over a wide field the same principle as is adopted for imports generally should be applied in like manner to imported agricultural commodities, and to fish of all kinds, including canned fish (paras. 14 and 57).    The Committee also submit a list of agricultural commodities and of certain kinds of fish which might be included in a selective tariff (paras. 25 and 59 - 61).reservations to the recommendations of the Committee in anote appended to the report.3. The docision of the Cabinet in connection with the balance of trade disposes of the question of a general tariff on agricultural products and on fish,  so far as it is raised the Secretary of State for Scotland has made certainin
fi f5 Qlii&apos;-this- report. - The eventual rate of duty on certain of these imports will, however, depend on the result of the negotiations at the Ottawa Conference, it being understood that tariff concessions to the Dominions at that Conference will, in the interests of home agriculture, take the form, In some cases, not of free entry Into the United Kingdom but at a rate of duty more favourable than the rate charged on the products of foreign countries.4. The question whether there should be any selective surtaxes on non-essential agricultural products and on fish will presumably fall for the consideration of the Advisory Committee which is to be set up to deal with that subject.5. There is^ however,  one commodity which calls for special mention in the Governments statement of policy.    This is malting barley (page 13, paragraph 29).   The Committee recommend that pending the preparation of a quota scheme, which will take time,  the Cabinet should agree to the imposition of a selective customs duty on malting barley conditional on its being found by further investigation -(1) that the cbst of staining or kibbling imported barley not intended for malting is not likely to increase unduly the price of feeding barleys in this countryj    and (2) that the process of staining or kibbling will be effective for the purpose in view. In view of the fact that all barley (i.e. feeding barley as well as malting barley) will be included In the general tariff of 10$ there will be a strong demand from farmers for a surtax on malting barley only, and I suggest that if the Cabinet agree with the Committee&apos;s reuommendations, the Government&apos;3 announcement of agricultural policy should Include a statement that the administrative feasibility of levying &amp;  Customs duty on malting barley is under considerationwith
with a view to tho question of a surtax being referred to the advisory Committee at the earliest possible date.6. The only other question in connection with agricultural tariffs which requires a decision of the Cabinet Is the recommendation of the Agricultural Policy Committee that the Horticultural Products (Emergency Customs Duties) Act should be continued (pago 8, paragraph 21).7. There are still to be considered the recommendations of the Committee on long range policy which, the Committee suggest, should be designed to facilitate economic development and re-o.-iganisation in those branches of the agricultural industry which, In the long run, are likely to be the most remunerative (paras. 34 et seq.).    In this connection decisions by the Cabinet are required on the following recommendations of the Committee(a) Milk. The Committee recommend that the Government announcement should include a statement that the Government intend to pursue a comprehensive policy In regard to milk and milk products involving tariffs on imports (which will now be Imposed as part of the general tariff), the reduction of disease among dairy herds and the improvement of marketing.    The Committee recommend that an approved scheme for reducing bovine tuberculosis should be put into operation at the earliest possible date, and I suggest that a small Committee of Officials of the Departments concerned with this question should be appointed to consider the matter and report on what, in their opinion, is the most suitable scheme.   As regards marketing the National Farmers&apos; Union at their annual meeting a few days ago passed a resolution by a small majority recommending that are-organlsatlon
re-organisation commission under the Agricultural Marketing Act,  1931, should he set up for the milk industry (pages 16 and 17). (b)Potatoes.   The Committee recommend that the Government statement should include an undertaking to appoint a re-organisation commission, if desired by potato grov;ers, with instructions to prepare a scheme for the organisation of the marketing of the home potato crop and to consider such complementary action consistent with treaty obligations as may appear to be necessary or desirable for the regulation of imports of main crop potatoes (page 17, para. 40). (c) Bacon and Hams.   The Committee do not suggest a tariff on bacon and hams.   They recommend that the Government should constitute an ad hoc committee charged with the task of preparing a schemo for the organisation of the bacon industry, and that the Government statement on agricultural policy should contain an assurance that, provided a satisfactory scheme is evolved, the Government is prepared to adopt some form of quantitative regulation of imports consistent with treaty obligations (page 20, para. 46). (d)Agricultura 1 y orkers.   The Committee recommend that any announcement of the Government policy respecting agriculture should include a statement of the facilities at present available for investigating complaints that the requirements of the Orders^made under the Agricultural wages (Regulation) Act are not being observed.    Some members of the Committee consider that w Ith a view to increasing the number of test Inspections, a specific undertaking should be given to restore wholly or partially the special temporary Inspectorate which was recently dispensed with
with as a measure of economy (page 21, para. 49). (e ^Research and Education.   The Committee recommend that the announcement should include a statement to the effect that the Government recognise the services which agricultural research and education have rendered to the agricultural community, that the Government have reason to know that these services meet with steadily growing appreciation among farmers, and that so far as financial circumstances permit the Government propose to maintain and develop the organised system which already exists (page 23, para. 51). (f)Land Settlement.    The Committee recommend that the statement should includo an assurance that a land settlement policy will he pursued within the limits of the financial resources available  (page 22, para.52). (g)National Mark.    The Committee emphasise the necessity of developing the National Mark movement and recommend that plans and investigations to this end should be proceeded with as rapidly as circumstances permit, (page 23, para. 53). (fa)Fish.    The Committee recommend that the report of the Economic Advisory Council on the fishing industry (CP.  1(32))  should be examined by an Inter-departmental Committee consisting of representatives of the Departments concerned and of the Secretariat of the Economic Advisory Council.J.G.ry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 10, &quot;Jhitehall Place, S. v i. 1.27th January,  1932.
