THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1932.SECRET. Copy No.      9CP. 5 (32).CABINET.DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.Note by the. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the Report of theCabinet Committee.1. AS this Report is of necessity a long and rather technical document, it is convenient to summarise its main features. It Avill be found that while some important steps are proposed in the direction of international disarmament, the reductions fall short of the full hopes of many who have not had to study the technical aspects of the matter or the special needs of the British position. The recommendations, standing by themselves, may well be considered not to &quot;fill the bill.&quot; After setting out what they amount to, I propose in a subsequent para-graph to point out the dilemma in which we are placed if we want to give a further lead and to indicate the only way in which, as it seems to me. we can make our own efforts towards international disarmament more effective.2. If the Cabinet approves the recommendations of the Committee, the British Delegation at Geneva will be authorised to advocate, or support under conditions which vary in each case : (a) The abolition of submarines (paragraph 64, page 15 of the Report);(b) The reduction in size of capital ships and reduction of maximum guncalibre (paragraph 63, page 14);(c) The abolition of gas and chemical warfare (paragraph 77, page 17). i.e.,we should support Article 39 of the Draft Convention;(d) The abolition of conscription (paragraph 10, page 5);(e) The principle of prohibiting land guns above a certain calibre (para-graph 66, page 15);(/) Subject to discussion with the Dominions, the principle of budgetary limitation, and, generally, of the methods of limitation contained in the Draft Convention (paragraph 18, page 6, &amp;c.);(g) The establishment of a permanent Disarmament Commission (para-graph 56, page 13).3. The principal matters in which the Committee has found itself unable, having regard to the advice of the Service experts, to recommend a course which is widely advocated by many well-wishers to disarmament are (a) The abolition of military aeroplanes (paragraph 69, page 16); and(b) The abolition of tanks (paragraph 67, page 16).4. Now the above list of proposals, though really very substantial, will be regarded, in many quarters, as going but a part of the way. In particular, there is the omission of a proposal to reduce numbers by an all-round percentage cut. It is impossible to apply an all-round percentage cut unless a suitable datum line is first established which will be fair as between the countries that have already set an example by large reductions (as Britain has) and other countries which have not. Here arises the dilemma referred to above : we cannot hope to persuade other Powers to reduce their armaments by telling them that we cannot reduce ours; and, on the other hand, our -previous reductions have made it, in ther6434]
opinion of our technical advisers, practically impossible to effect very substantial further reduction ourselves.5. there seems to me to be only one way out of this dilemma and it is for the cabinet to consider whether they will take it. that way is to make some proposal which will afford added &quot; security &quot; to others on condition that others come down to our level of armament, or, at any rate, reduce to a point which we regard as a satisfactory equivalent. the advantage of this method of endeavouring to secure a reduction is that we are able to make the proposal and still keep control of its working out in our own hands by defining the conditions under which we would accept the new commitments, &amp;c.6. the most practical application of the above policy would be that his majesty&apos;s government should offer to participate in a mediterranean locarno on condition that the other PoAvers participating should reduce their armaments to a point which we should consider suitable. the mediterranean locarno would be in the nature of a pact of mutual guarantee between powers bordering on the mediterranean or having great interests in that region. the guarantee would take the form of an undertaking for mutual assistance in the case of any one of the signatory powers being attacked by any of the other PoAvers signatory. (it will be seen from cabinet resolution of the 15th december (cabinet 91 (31), conclusion 2 (b) (iii)) that the idea of a mediterranean locarno was thought to be worthy of careful consideration.)i must make it quite clear that the suggestion in paragraphs 4-6 of this note has not been before the committee. it represents only the result of my own reflections, and i am also aware that a departmental sub-committee has reported against this proposals in forming a judgment on it. however, one has to ask oneself : (a) are not the consequences of failure at the disarmament conference so grave as to justify such a proposal as the means of securing reduction of arma-ments, or, at any rate, of absolving britain from the reproach of having failed to make an adequate contribution to secure it? (fe) granted that any new commit-ment on our part has to be narrowly scrutinised, is such a commitment as this, in return for a substantial reduction of armaments on the continent, less dangerous than the position which is likely to arise Avithout it ?j.

REPORT.Introduction.1. THE Cabinet Committee on Preparation for the Disarmament Conference was appointed &apos;&apos; to undertake the supervision of the remaining work of preparation for the Disarmament Conference, and prepare instructions for the United Kingdom delegation for the approval of the Cabinet.&quot;2. In accordance with these directions the Committee has put before the Cabinet an appreciation of the elements in the political problems underlying the whole question of international disarmament.3. Quite apart from these political problems, however, there are a considerable number of technical problems which must present themselves when it comes to giving effect to any limitation or reduction of armaments. What these problems are likely to be can be seen from a consideration of the Draft Disarmament Convention, which was prepared by a Committee of the League as a basis of discussion at the Conference. The Resolutions of the Three Party Committee also indicate possible topics for discussion. It is the purpose of this Report to examine these remaining problems and to put forward, where possible, recommendations to the Cabinet as to the policy which might appropriately be pursued. It is felt to be desirable that the Governments policy on all points connected with the Disarmament Conference should be determined, in so far as this is possible, before the United Kingdom delegation leave for Geneva. It is realised that in certain cases it may be impossible to give definite directions, and that some discretion must be left to the United Kingdom delegation to deal ad hoc with questions as they arise on the spot. It will be difficult, however, to know where such discretion can be given without first considering the more important points that will come up for discussion.4. A short explanation is given of each point as it arises, and, where necessary, the Departmental views as expressed in the report of Mr. Cadogan&apos;s Committee have been included. In this way it is hoped it may be possible to show clearly the reasons for, and the force of any recommendations put forward.THE DRAFT CONVENTION.Part I. Personnel.Chapter A. Effectives (Articles 2-4).5. These Articles deal with the limitation of effectives in the land, sea and air forces, and also in formations organised on a military basis; that is to say, that each country is required to fill in the tables annexed to this chapter the figures for the average daily effectives of their armed forces, which they agree are not to be exceeded for the duration of the Convention.6. The German delegation has made a reservation to these articles to the effect that no attempt has been made in this Convention to limit or reduce the reserves of personnel in conscript States. The German reservation is senseless, really, because by no means is it possible to &quot; limit or reduce the reserves of personnel.&quot; Reserves consist of men who have served their time and received their training with the colours, whether in a conscript or in a voluntary service army. It is impossible to &quot;limit&quot; them they just accrue. Of course in the case of the conscript army they accrue in larger numbers, because the period of training is short and every man becomes a reservist once he has been through his
training. What the Germans mean by their reservation is a protest against conscription (which is denied to them). But we cannot abolish conscription (of this more later); short of abolition, we can only attempt to lessen the evil by limiting the size of the annual contingent. This is quite possible under the Draft Disarmament Convention, which provides for a total limitation of effectives with the colours. If only that total can be kept low enough, conscript States will have to choose between taking each year for training only a percentage of their possible recruits or reducing the period of service to a duration that will seriously impair the efficiency of their troops with the colours and, in proportion, of their reserves. The Germans ought to reach the same conclusion that we have reached that we shall not, in practice, secure the abolition of conscription. They had much better take the Draft Convention as they find it, and try to insert such figures as will reduce the size or the fighting efficiency of the continental conscript armies.7. So far as this country is concerned, the only questions of policy involved are those in connection with the insertion of figures in the tables. The War Office have already put forward suggestions as to the strengths which we should claim. The total is slightly larger than our present figures. These figures repre-sent the number of personnel required in the light of our commitments, together with a margin for contingencies. The Admiralty and Air Ministry have also submitted proposals for the respective strengths of their services, and these three papers are being circulated direct to the Cabinet for consideration.Recommendation.We therefore recommend That the method of limitation of effectives in the land, sea and air forces on the lines of Articles 2-4 of the Draft Disarmament Convention should be supported. We fully realise that if every nation, while adopting this method of limitation, claims for itself a higher maximum than it has at present reached, no general disarmament will be secured by applying this method. Nevertheless, the fixing of maxima at as low a figure as possible is a method which we are bound to approve..Chapter B. Period of Service (Articles 5-9).8. The provisions in this chapter apply only to effectives recruited by conscription, and therefore are inapplicable so far as we are concerned. The general scheme of this Chapter is to provide for the limitation of the maximum total periods of service to which the effectives recruited by conscription are liable; that is to say, the total period of service of such personnel must not exceed x months. The actual number of months is at present blank, and remains to be filled in at the Disarmament Conference. The Chinese dele-gation have, however, reserved the right to raise again the question of the abolition of conscription, and it is necessary, therefore, for us to decide on the attitude we may wish to adopt to this proposal, if it is again put forward.9. We have, in the past, advocated the abolition of conscription. We secured its abandonment by the defeated nations after the war. So long as all continental nations (except the ex-enemies) retain conscription, and freedom in the manner of applying it, the size of their armies is conditioned by their vital statistics alone. But we must face facts, and the fact is that we shall certainly not succeed in securing its abolition. The arguments of its advocates are these  -they may be good or bad. The whole of their democratic system is based on the idea of equality of sacrifice in the national interest. They cannot contem-plate any departure from the principle of liability of service. The French in particular have evil memories of the system which existed under the Second Empire, and to which they ascribe the culminating disaster. They maintain that a system of universal service gives almost every family in the land a direct stake in the question of peace or war, and that therefore conscription mobilises the population against military adventure.   (The answer to this is that the last
war showed us that no family is exempt in any case once the country is involved.) Finally, they have the to us, almost unintelligible fear that an army of &quot; mercenaries &quot; might be used as a political pawn.10. Therefore, while we may say that in our view the abolition of conscription would be a useful step towards the limitation of armies, it may be more practical to urge that, even with the retention of conscription, there is no reason why the numbers of effectives with the colours and, as a consequence, ultimately of the reserves should not be reduced by raising standards of fitness and enlarging the grounds of exemption.Recommendation.We recommend That as a general principle we should support any proposal for the abolition of conscription. We realise, however, that this is a somewhat contentious subject, and that it is possible that to raise it at the Conference might prove a source of irritation to countries now employing the conscription system without any likelihood of getting the proposal to abolish conscription accepted. We would suggest, there-fore, that the instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation on this point should be so framed as to allow them latitude either to advocate the abolition of conscription, if circumstances prove favourable, or to adopt a non-committal attitude if, in their opinion, such a course might prove wiser. We would also point out that to advocate the abolition of conscription would be definitely to support Germany against France, and. for political reasons, it is possible that such a course may prove undesirable.Part II. Material.Chapter A. Land Armaments (Article 10).11. This Article makes provision for limitation of the annual expenditure on the upkeep, purchase and manufacture of war material for land armaments.12.   This is the beginning of &quot; Budgetary limitation.&quot;13. The Governments represented at Geneva were unable to agree on any numerical limitation of land war weapons, such as was imposed on the defeated countries. The chief reason for this was that any such limitation, unless it was to be a farce, would require a degree of supervision which, though easy enough to impose on defeated enemies, would not be willingly accepted by independent Governments.14. The only alternative on which agreement could be reached was a system of limitation of the expenditure on such weapons.   Hence this article.15. With every day that passes, it becomes more and more futile to limit the effectives of an army if there is no limitation on the material equipment. The whole tendency is towards the perfection of weapons and development of machinery, and if there is no other way of doing it, it would seem necessary at least to have a limit on what may be spent on equipping an army with weapons and meclianical accessories.16. For a discussion of the merits and difficulties of budgetary limitation in general, see the Report of Mr. Cadogan&apos;s Committee, paragraphs 30-45 inclusive.17. The American Delegation stated that, for constitutional reasons, they were unable to accept the idea of budgetary limitation. They intimated that they would prefer some form of direct limitation. It is, however, not certain that the United States Delegation would maintain their constitutional objection, and it is interesting to note that in supplying their statistics for the use of the Disarmament Conference they have given full and detailed budgetary particulars. The German Delegation has objected strongly to this Article on the grounds that
no attempt is made to limit directly either material in service or in reserve. Moreover, this constituted an additional limitation on Germany, which was not included in the Peace Treaty, and if she is to remain bound by the latter, she would naturally resent any additional limitation.18. From our own point of view the War Office have always considered that a numerical limitation, for the reason given in paragraph 13 above, is imprac-ticable, and they have therefore always accepted the idea of indirect or budgetary limitation for land war material.Recommendation.We recommend That we should support the method of limitation of land war material as proposed in Article 10 of the draft Convention. We appreciate that to limit land armaments only by means of restricting the amounts spent thereon falls a long way short of the limitation imposed on Germany under Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, but we also realise that the difficulties of limiting all kinds of land weapons, including the smaller varieties, e.g., machine guns, rifles, &amp;c, are almost insuperable, and we think, therefore, that, in practice, the indirect method is likely to prove the most effective.Chapter B. Naval Armaments (Articles 11-23).19. These Articles deal with limitation of naval armaments, and it is sufficient to say that they are based entirely on the Treaties of Washington and London; that is to say, limitation is by total tonnage in categories, together with a limitation of the maximum calibre of main armament guns in each category.20. The Admiralty are most anxious that nothing should be done in the draft Convention to invalidate or amend the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which they rightly point out form the only armaments limitation at present in existence. One of the main objects of the London Naval Conference, as defined in the invitation issued by His Majesty&quot;s Government in the United Kingdom, was to facilitate the task of the League of Nations Preparatory Corn-mission and of the subsequent General Disarmament Conference. This point was stressed in the French reply to the invitation, which made the point that this was in fact the &quot; express object &quot; of the Conference.The London Naval Conference, by reaching agreement between the major Naval Powers limiting the tonnages of all classes of ships until 1936, did undoubtedly make a valuable contribution to Naval Limitation of Armaments and take a big step in the direction of facilitating the task of the Disarmament Conference.The difficulty of the Disarmament Conference will be enormous, especially as it now appears that, apart from the large number of smaller Powers whose conflicting claims will have to be reconciled, the question of the tonnage to be allowed to France and Italy, will also have to be discussed.If the major Powers enter the Disarmament Conference in agreement among themselves, they will be in a strong position to influence and bring pressure on other Powers to reduce their armaments in turn. If, on the other hand, the major Powers reopen the whole question between themselves, they will be in no position to do this their influence will be greatly reduced, and with it the prospect of success in imposing any reduction on other Powers.Shortly, it may be said that to throw the Agreement reached at the London Conference into the melting pot at the 1932 Conference would be likely to increase the difficulties of that Conference to an impossible extent.One way, and perhaps the simplest way, of securing the desideratum that nothing which is now done should put in jeopardy the Washington and London Naval Treaties, would be to provide that the Naval clauses of the Disarmament Convention should co-terminate with these Treaties.21. So far neither France nor Italy have subscribed to Part III of the London Naval Treaty, and therefore they are not bound as regards numbers of light cruisers, destroyers and submarines.   Efforts are at present in progress to
obtain their adherence to this part of the London Naval Treaty before the Disarmament Conference meets. It is not known, however, what are the prospects of success in this direction, but- it is known that the figures in the bases of agreement are on a higher level in respect of certain types of vessels than His Majesty&apos;s Government at the time considered acceptable in relation to our strength under the London Naval Treaty. It may not be possible to determinp exactly what the position will be until the Disarmament Conference, but it is pointed out that should France insist on a very high figure for submarines or light surface vessels it may be necessary for us to reconsider the figures by which we are bound. It will be recollected that Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty does provide a let-out clause for meeting such a contingency.22. A number of small, and in some cases, newly created. States have put in a reservation to these Articles intended to prepare the way for a demand for the creation of what they consider to be adequate naval forces for the protection of their interests. The demands of these States will need careful scrutiny because it is understood in certain cases considerable numbers of submarines will be claimed. In order, however, to meet the case of those maritime States not parties to either the Washington or London Naval Treaties, the Admiralty have submitted detailed proposals. This paper also contains special reference to the present position of Germany, who is limited as regards her naval forces by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, the provisions of which differ from those in the Washington and London Naval Treaties. The Admiralty emphasise the undesirability of having two methods of limitation of naval forces, one of which has tended to the production of what may be termed a freak battleship. They suggest that from every point of view it would be desirable to bring Germany in on the same basis as all other countries, though this suggestion is not meant to imply necessarily that Germany should be allowed any considerable increase in the size of her naval forces at present.23. Generally speaking, therefore, our aim should be to confirm the Treaties of Washington and London, and to fix the tonnage of all navies not governed by those Treaties at proportionate levels.Recommendations.We recommend (a) That we should support generally the method of limitation of naval armaments as proposed in Articles 11-23 of the draft Convention, and, in particular, we should strongly support the proposal that nothing should be done in the draft Convention to invalidate or amend the Washington and London Naval Treaties.(&amp;) That one method, and perhaps the simplest, of securing that nothing is done to jeopardise the Washington and London Naval Treaties would be to provide that the naval clauses of the Disarmament Convention should co-terminate with these treaties. As it is possible, however, that other methods of securing this desideratum may be suggested, we think that discretion should be left to the United Kingdom delegation as to the method of securing this principle.(c) That we should make every effort to induce Prance and Italy to modify the claims which they are at present putting forward under Part III of the London Naval Treaty. Unless the final figures submitted are satisfactory from our point of view, we think our delegation should be Instructed to reserve our position under Part III of the London Naval Treaty. It is possible that this matter will not have been settled before the Disarmament Conference, and it may, therefore, be necessary either to allow our delegation some latitude in regard to this point, or else to instruct them to refer the question back for-decision by the Cabinet when it arises.(d) That Ave should endeavour to get the demands of the smaller maritimePowers for the creation of naval forces of appreciable sizes reduced as far as possible, particularly claims for the construction of submarine fleets. The majority of these smaller and newly-created States possess no naval forces of any significance at present, and it is, therefore, undesirable that the Disarmament Conference should be[6356] c
used as a medium for the creation of forces which might otherwise not be contemplated at all. (e) That we should endeavour to obtain acceptance of the idea that the methods of limitation of German naval forces should be the same as. those under the Washington and London Naval Treaties. In putting forward this recommendation we are not wishing to imply that any considerable increase should be permitted at present in the numbers and tonnage of the forces allowed to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, but rather that Germany should be prevented from producing vessels of a freak nature, which may conceivably lead to a competition of an undesirable nature. We realise fully that this suggestion impinges on matters of some delicacy and would require extremely careful handling at the Disarmament Conference, and we suggest, therefore, that, while our delegation should be told that we support the principle of one universal form of limitation of naval armaments, they are left discretion as to the method by which they put forward this proposal, and even given latitude not to put this proposal forward at all, if it is likely merely to cause difficulties in the Conference without any likelihood of success.Article 24.24. This Article provides for limitation of annual expenditure or budgetary limitation of naval war material, in addition to the direct limitation provided for in the preceding articles.25. It has been explained above how budgetary limitation was applied to land war material because of the impossibility of applying a numerical limitation. Certain continental nations make a great point of the equal treatment of all three arms, and consequently demanded the extension of budgetary limitation to naval and air material.26. The question of the application of budgetary limitation to naval material raises, in any case, amongst other questions, some difficulties of adjust-ment as between ourselves and the Dominions, and until it has been possible to discuss the various points with the Dominions it would seem wiser to defer any definite recommendation on this matter.27. Subject to the result of the iDroposed discussions with the Dominions, and provided our budgetary figure is such as to enable us to construct and maintain the full amount of tonnage allowed to us under the Treaties of Washington and London and to make good existing serious deficiencies in reserves of war material, fuel, stores, &amp;o, there would seem, apart from the unnecessary complication, to be no insuperable objection to the acceptance of budgetary limitation. The whole question is discussed in paragraphs 47-51 inclusive of the Report of Mr. Cadogan&apos;s Committee.28. Mention has already been made of the difficult)&quot;- experienced by the American Delegation in accepting budgetary limitation. The United Kingdom Delegation has put in a reservation to the effect that its acceptance of this article must depend on the attitude finally adopted by other maritime Powers.29. Attention should, also, here be drawn to another considerable difficulty in regard to the application of budgetary limitation to the Navy. Under the Washington and London Naval Treaties, the members of the British Common-wealth are allowed one single quota of vessels in all classes which can be distributed between the Commonwealth without restriction; that is to say, provided the total tonnage allowed in each category is not exceeded, its distribu-tion in the Commonwealth is a matter of domestic policy. It should be pointed out that the Washington and London Naval Treaties are not League instruments, .and the fact that it was found possible to adopt the abqve arrangement does not imply that it would necessarily be regarded as suitable in the case of a treaty concluded under the auspices of the League.30. The Admiralty point out that if one quota is allowed for ail the members of the Commonwealth for tonnage and numbers of vessels, it should logically follow that we should be allowed also one collective limit for expenditure, if it
should be finally decided to accept budgetary limitation for Naval Forces. On the other hand, there would be considerable difficulties in procedure owing to the difference in time of the budgetary years in the different parts of the Common-wealth. The Admiralty naturally insist that, being situated as we are, we ought not, under any circumstances, to accept any kind of limitation which would prevent the distribution of Naval Forces in accordance with strategic needs, or would prevent one part of the Commonwealth assuming a larger proportion of naval defence than it does at present. This matter is of considerable importance, and although the Dominions were informed at the Imperial Conference, 1930, of the position, no discussions with them have taken place, and it is, therefore, not possible to say what their reactions on this matter are.Recommendation.We recommend (a) That, in view of the fact that acceptance of the limitation of annual expenditure on naval war material, as proposed in Article 24 of the draft Convention, affects intimately the division of expenditure between this country and the Dominions and may involve difficulties of adjustment, no final decision should be given on this article of the Convention until discussions have taken place with representatives of the Dominions, which it is hoped to arrange at an early date. In any case, however, we recommend that, if other maritime Powers do not accept this limitation of annual expenditure, we should not accept it either.(b) That if the limitation of annual expenditure is accepted we should insist that it is without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaties of Washington and London; that is to say, the budgetary figures should enable us to construct and maintain the full amount of tonnage allowed to us under those Treaties.Chapter C. Air Armaments (Articles 25-28).31. These articles make provision for the direct limitation of military and naval aircraft of all kinds by limiting the number and total horse-power of aircraft in commission and in immediate reserve. It should be noted here that this is the only kind of limitation proposed for air war material. Unlike the other two Services, the idea of budgetary limitation, although suggested, was rejected.32. The question may well be reopened. If budgetary limitation is accepted for military and naval material, it will almost certainly be i^proposed for air material as well.33. The argument in favour of its adoption is that it would prevent competition in the development of more powerful and consequently more expensive types of aircraft.34. Article 28 also seeks to prevent the use of civil aviation directly to supplement military aviation.35. The German Delegation have put in their usual reservation that the limitation proposed does not touch material in reserve.36. As regards our own Air Force, the Air Ministry have several points of importance in connection with the filling in of the limitation tables attached to this article.37. The first of these questions deals with the size of the metropolitan and overseas quotas to be allowed. As regards the metropolitan quota, it was suggested that we should claim effective parity with France.[6356] d
38. The Air Ministry suggest that, if both limitation of numbers of aircraft and also of total horse-power of aircraft are to be retained, in order to obtain effective parity with the military air forces of France, we should require either(a) a larger number of aircraft of equal performance to those of the French, or(b) if we have numerical equality, our aircraft should have superior individual performance, i.e., a margin of horse-power.39. The Air Ministry state that they are unable to suggest any figures for the size at which the air force may be limited under the Convention until the question of the relative sizes of the British and French air forces as regards metropolitan quotas has been determined. As regards the question of the numbers for the overseas quota, the Air Ministry suggest that the figures could only be arrived at by an analysis of the particular and co-ordinated requirements in each theatre. They add that whatever figures may eventually be determined will probably be. larger than the present figures.40. As regards horse-power for aircraft, the Air Ministry have submitted a memorandum, in which they suggest that the horse-power limitation for aircraft such as has been proposed by the Expert Committee of the League for application to the draft Disarmament Convention is impracticable, and is likely, in its application, if adopted, to be against the best interests of this country. They recommend that no such limit should be accepted.41. The Air Ministry are also uneasy as to the position of seaborne aircraft, and have explained at length their views. They point out that there are large projected increases in the seaborne air forces of foreign naval powers, and more particularly in the United States. There are no restric-tions at present on the size of the fleet air arm (other than the limitation under the Washington Naval Treaty of the total tonnage of aircraft carriers allowed); and the Air Ministry assume that, as we are permitted parity with the United States under the Washington Naval Treaty, as regards naval vessels, logically we ought also to claim parity as regards the fleet air arm. It is felt to be very important to prevent a competition in ship-borne aircraft, and that consequently negotiations should be opened with the United States with a view to arriving at some agreed basis which will obviate the necessity of any increase beyond the real needs of our fleet air arm. In any such negotiations it is felt strongly that no attempt to alter the basis of the Washington and London Naval Treaties should be made, and that the method of limiting the number of aircraft to be carried would consequently appear to be that most likely to prove acceptable.Recommendation.We recommend (a) That we should accept the method of direct limitation of military aircraft of all kinds by limiting the number in commission and in immediate reserve, as proposed in Articles 25-28 of the Draft Disarmament Convention.(b) That the additional limitation of total horse-power of aircraft in corn-mission and in immediate reserve also proposed under Articles 25-28 of the Draft Disarmament Convention, is right in principle, but we have doubts as to the wisdom of accepting this additional form of limitation because we are advised that the application of the limita-tion of horse-power is impracticable and is capable of extremely easy evasion. A method of limiting horse-power has been proposed by a Sub-Committee of the League, but it is understood that this method is not considered satisfactory. We think, therefore, it might be advis-able to instruct our Delegation to the effect that we reserve our acceptance of this form of limitation unless a really satisfactory method can be found. In other words, our Delegation should be allowed to use their discretion in this matter.(c) That we should support the provisions of Article 28, which seek to preventthe use of civil aviation directly to supplement military aviation.
(d) That, while realising fully the weight of the Air Ministry^ contention.that, in view of the vulnerability of this country to air attack, we ought not to accept any limitation of metropolitan aircraft inferior to that of the strongest Continental Power capable of attacking this country from the air; we feel that to claim parity with France, as the proposal implies, is to go to the Disarmament Conference asking for the right to double the strength of our air forces maintained in the United Kingdom. Since, however, this is a matter which vitally affects the security of this country, we hesitate to recommend that we should accept a lower figure than France, and we propose that the first step should be a strong endeavour to get France to reduce the size of her air forces. If this should prove impossible, then we think our numbers should be framed on a basis which will afford us reason-able security in the light of the figures France proposes to insert in the draft Convention.(e) That the quota allowed for overseas aircraft should be based solely onour requirements in the different overseas theatres, allowing perhaps a small margin for contingencies, and that the Air Ministry should be instructed to submit figures on this basis..(/) That it is very important to prevent a competition in ship-borne aircraft, and that negotiations should be opened with the United States with a view to arriving at some agreed basis which will obviate the necessity of any increase, beyond the real needs, of our fleet air arm. In any such negotiations we feel strongly that no attempt should be made to alter the basis of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and that the method of limiting the number of aircraft to be carried would consequently appear to be that most likely to prove acceptable. We feel that some latitude must be left to our Delegation to conduct these negotiations as best they can, and, if necessary, to refer any important matters of principle raised to the Cabinet for decision.(g) That, although no provision is made at present in the Draft Disarmament Convention for the limitation of expenditure on air war material, there appear to be some grounds for accepting such limitation. The Committee of the League has reported that such limitation is feasible, and we suggest that our Delegation should be instructed not to support but, on the other hand, not to oppose the addition of separate budgetary limitation for air war material if such a proposal is brought up and- should be generally accepted at the Disarmament Conference.Part III. Budgetary Expenditure (Article 29).42. This Article proposes that the total expenditure on land, sea and air forces and formations organised on a military basis, shall be limited.43. The position as regards budgetary limitation can be stated briefly as follows : It is proposed that, in addition to the limitation of the total global expenditure figure as given in Article 29, there shall be separate limitation within this global total for expenditure on land war material and naval war material; provision is not made for separate limitation of air war material.44. The method by which budgetary limitation may be applied in practice is the subject of a report by a special Committee of Experts, set up by the League (C.D.C. (31) 6). This report was examined in some detail by Mr. Cadogan&apos;s Committee, and the results of this examination were included as Appendix li A &quot; to their report (C.D.C. (31) 10).45. The Committee of Budgetary Experts reported that it would be possible to have a separate total expenditure limitation for each of the three services, and we are prepared to recommend acceptance of this principle.46.   The American reservation on budgetary limitation has already been noted, and attention may also be drawn to the fact that we shall be obliged to claim budgetary limits considerably in excess of the scale of our present expen-diture in all three Services.   Until the questions requiring adjustment between [8358] d 2
ourselves and the Dominions in respect of budgetary limitation of naval war material and total naval expenditure have been discussed, it is not possible for us to put forward any definite recommendations.Recommendation.We recommend That, although we recommend, in principle, acceptance of the proposal that there should be a separate total expenditure limitation for each of the three Services, we desire to reserve our recommendation on Article 29 of the Draft Disarmament Convention until we have discussed with representatives of the Dominions the problems connected with the proposal to apply budgetary limitation to naval war material and total naval expenditure.(Note. We have not consulted the Treasury in framing our recom mendations on budgetary limitation.    We realise that this question raises certain principles in which the Treasury may be vitally interested, and we suggest, therefore, that before any final decision is taken, the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be sought.)Part IV. Exchange of Information (Articles 30-38).47. These Articles provide model tables, the idea of which is the exchange of information each year in regard to the size of the armed forces and the sums of money spent on them. The German delegation has made a reservation, the point of which is that no arrangements are contemplated for publicity of trained reserves, the figure of the annual contingent, or for any reserves of material.48. In regard to this question of publicity of reserves of personnel, it is understood that, even if official publicity is not given, it is comparatively easy to calculate the personnel available in any country. The question of publicity of reserves of material is quite another matter, however, and it may be recalled that Resolution 8 of the Three-Party Committee suggested that it was desirable to press for full publicity in regard to reserves of material as well as personnel. The Chiefs of Staff have submitted a report strongly condemning the idea that we should disclose reserves of material, and they added that it was only the fact that reserves of material had been kept secret which has enabled them to accept the very deplorable condition into which the reserves of all our fighting services have, for financial reasons, been allowed to deteriorate. They add that, if it is proposed to adopt publicity of material as part of our policy, they will be compelled to ask for large increases in their votes in order to make good deficiencies.49. Disclosure of our own weakness would have two obvious disadvantages : it might expose us to attack, and it would lessen our weight in the councils of the world.50. As regards the former point, it might be answered that to suggest that the weaker nation might be fallen upon by its neighbours, anxious to take advantage of their superiority, is to argue a cynical disregard for the Covenant, the Pact of Paris and other international instruments in which Governments have professed faith.51. There appears to be no answer to the second point. On the other hand, the disclosure of reserves is argued by many Governments to be a necessary concomitant of budgetary limitation. In the case of two armies of equal size, it would be unfair to impose the same budgetary figure if, in fact, one army was already fully equipped with up-to-date weapons, while the other was not. That would be penalising the one country that had economised on its armaments to the advantage of the other that had armed to the teeth.52. That is the advantage that we should get from disclosure of reserves  a comparatively larger budgetary margin than other countries, assuming that we are more behindhand in our stocks of material than they are.53. In any case it should be borne in mind that these two questions, budgetary limitation and disclosure of reserves, are closely bound up together.
54. Article 37 contemplates certain publicity for civil aviation, and various delegations have suggested that it might be more convenient to deal with civil aviation in a special separate convention.55. It is also possible, we understand, that the question of inter-nationalising civil and perhaps military aviation may be raised at the Conference. The Air Ministry have expressed emphatically the view that any such proposals, besides being of an impracticable nature, would react very unfavourably on us, especially as regards civil aviation, because for geographical and other reasons, the size of our civil aviation can never be at all comparable with that of the organisations in States on the continent, which are more favourably placed.Recommendation.We recommend (a) That we should accept the machinery proposed in Articles 30-34 and36-38 of the draft Disarmament Convention for the exchange of information as to the size of the armed forces of each country and the sums of money spent on them. As Article 35 raises a point on which further discussion may be necessary at Geneva, we suggest that the final decision be left to our Delegation to determine.(b) That there Avould be no objection to accepting in principle, the idea of publicity of reserves of personnel since this information is readily available whether official publicity exists or not. On the other hand, it is difficult to divorce publicity of reserves of personnel from publicity of reserves of material, and we are impressed with the idea that it would be definitely detrimental to our security to press for publicity of material, and we recommend therefore we should not support the idea of any publicity of reserves at all.(c) That as regards the question of dealing with civil aviation in a separateConvention instead of including certain publicity as is proposed in Article 37, we suggest that discretion should be allowed to our Delegation as to the attitude they adopt in accordance with the discussion as it may develop at the Conference. (cl) That we should not support any idea of internationalising civil or military aviation. We do not think that any such proposals are really practicable, and we are doubtful whether, if adopted, this form of force might not react to our disadvantage in view of our peculiar situation, and the lack of civil aviation facilities in this country.Part VI.- Miscellaneous Provisions.Chapter A. Permanent Disarmament Commission (Articles 40-49).56. These articles make provision for the setting up of a Permanent Disarmament Commission to supervise the execution of the Draft Convention. The method proposed is that this Commission, which shall be of a permanent nature, shall receive all the returns in connection with the Draft Disarmament Convention, shall scrutinise them, and, in any case of doubt, shall examine witnesses thereon; should any cases of defection become apparent, they would report the matter to the Council of the League. No objection has been raised to this procedure, which was the one contemplated m Resolution 6 of the Three-Party Committee Resolutions. It is considered, however, that no system such as was applied to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, which involved the right of inspection on the spot, could be applied to nations not situated in the - same position as was Germany at that time.Recommendations.We recommend (a) That we should accept the proposal to set up a permanent Disarmament Commission to supervise the execution of the draft Convention as proposed in Articles 40-49 of the draft Convention.(6) That we should oppose any suggestion to apply any system of supervision which might imply the right of inspection on the spot.
Chapter B. Derogations (Article 50.)57. This article is a let-out clause of which States may take advantage under special circumstances.Recommendation  We recommend That we should accept the provisions of Article 50 of the draft Disarmament Convention whereby, under special circumstances, States are given the right to suspend temporarily any provision or provisions of the Convention.Chapter C. Procedure regarding Complaints (Articles 51-52).58. These articles provide for the method of dealing with complaints, the procedure for which shall be to lay the matter before the Permanent Disarmament Commission.Recommenda tion  We recommend That we should accept the method of dealing with complaints proposed in Articles 51-52 of the Draft Disarmament Convention.Chapter D. Final Provisions (Articles 53-60).59. These articles deal with the duration of the Convention method of ratification, denunciation, &amp;c.60. As has already been noted, the Admiralty are very desirous that the naval clauses of the Draft Convention should be co-terminous with the Washington and London Naval Treaties.61. As regards the procedure for denunciation of the Convention, some, doubts have been expressed and as a result the legal advisers to the Foreign Office were consulted.It appears that the Convention cannot be denounced at any time during the initial period covered by the Convention and in any case denunciation cannot take effect until two years after such denunciation has been made.Recommendation.We recommend -That the final provisions of the draft Convention as set out in Articles 53-60 should be accepted subject to the proviso which we have already noted that it may be found desirable to press for the naval clauses of the Convention to co-terminate with the Washington and London Naval Treaties.SUGGESTIONS FOR ABOLISHING OR LIMITING SPECIFICWEAPONS.62. Resolution 6 of the Three-Party Committee pointed out the desirability of limiting or eliminating those weapons which were either prohibited or restricted by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles : it may be convenient, therefore, to deal with various weapons covered by this recommendation.(a) Is!aval Armaments.(i) The reduction in size [tonnage and calibre of main armaments) or abolition of capital ships.63. It is understood that the Admiralty would have no objection at all to some reduction in the size of the capital ship; such a reduction, if universally applied, would ultimately be of great financial benefit to us, even though we-
cannot, owing to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, in any case construct any new capital ships before 1937. The Admiralty suggest that as certain Powers may wish to lay down new capital ships before 1937, it might help in the general direction of reduction of armaments if agreement could be reached at Geneva to a reduction in the size of the capital ship, and, after consideration, they would be prepared to agree to the following limitations upon the size of new capital ships, and of their main armament guns : If the gun calibre is limited to 12-inch : 25,000 tons maximum displacement. If the gun calibre is limited to 135 or 14-inch :  27,500 tons maximum displacement.If the gun calibre is limited to 15 or 16-inch:  35,000 tons maximum displacement.A proposal for the reduction in size of capital ships was put forward at the London Naval Conference, but was rejected by the United States. It is under-stood, however, that the United States Government might now be disposed to come down to 28,000 tons, provided they are allowed themselves to initiate such a proposal, so as to avoid internal criticism that they have given way under foreign persuasion.Recommendation.We recommend That we should support the idea of a substantial reduction in the size of capital ships. In view of the ffict that the United States strongly opposed this suggestion at the London Naval Conference, but are believed recently to have modified this attitude, it might be better to allow the suggestion to emanate from the United States. We suggest that the method of handling this proposal should be left to the discretion of the United Kingdom Delegation.(ii) The abolition of the submarine, including the suggestion that all maritime States should adhere to Part IV of the London Naval Treaty. (Rides for submarine warfare against merchant ships.)64. The Admiralty would welcome the abolition of the submarine. On the other hand, France and Japan and a number of other States are firmly opposed to its abolition. This difference of opinion is mainly a question of national doctrine. France and Japan both hold that the submarine is essentially a defensive weapon, whereas we hold that the submarine is an offensive weapon. It seems unlikely, particularly in view of the large submarine tonnage which France has demanded, that it will be possible to secure the abolition of this weapon. There is plainly so little chance of securing abolition that any positive proposal to that effect on our part would be regarded as insincere. But there is no reason why that should deter us only we should have to consider carefully how to word our views on the point.65. If it is impossible to get the submarine abolished, then the Admiralty are most anxious that all maritime States should adhere to Part IV of the London Naval Treaty, which is an attempt to prevent submarines employing the same tactics against merchant vessels as were employed by German submarines in the last war.We recommend-.(a) That we should support any proposal for the abolition of submarines. In view of the fact that France and Japan and a number of other States are believed to be firmly opposed to the abolition of the submarine, we suggest that the handling of any such suggestion should be left to the discretion of the United Kingdom delegation.(b) That if it is found impossible to get the abolition of submarines accepted, we should propose that all maritime States should adhere to Part IV of the London Naval Treaty which embodies rules of war for submarines against merchant vessels.
(b) Land Armaments.(i) The prohibition of all guns above a certain calibre.66. This proposal is not recommended by the Chiefs of Staff on grounds of technical difficulties and the fact that any limitation or restriction of heavy guns could hardly be confined to land war material. Consideration would, also, have to be given to the restriction of bombing aeroplanes, which are merely a develop-ment of the heavy gun. It is also pointed out that any such restrictions could hardly be made effective without some system of control such as was imposed on Germany after the War.We recommend -That we should not put forward any suggestion for the prohibition of all guns above a certain calibre, but that if any reasonable and practicable suggestion of this nature is put forward and seems likely to be generally acceptable, we should not oppose it.(ii) The Abolition or Restriction of Tanks.67. The War Office have pointed out that they are not in favour of any attempt to abolish or restrict tanks, on the grounds that the tank is definitely a life-saving weapon, and also that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to define a tank or to differentiate between tanks and armoured lorries or armoured machines of all kinds. They urge that, if limitation of tanks is proposed, then also logically a limitation must be put forward for machine guns, to which the tank is the answer, because the machine gun is the weapon which dominates the battlefield to-day.68. It must be borne in mind, however, that these arguments have to be rather delicately put in the presence of a German Delegation.We recommend That we should not put forward any idea to abolish or restrict tanks. In view of the restrictions placed upon Germany by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, however, this question may need rather delicate handling.(c) Air Armaments. The Abolition of Military Aircraft.69. The abolition of military aircraft cannot be considered unless some means is found of dealing with the possible menace of civil aircraft.70. Civil machines can easily and rapidly be converted into Bombers. The abolition of military aircraft would therefore result in the supremacy in the air of the country with the most highly developed civil aviation. In present circumstances there is no possibility of our being that country! In fact, it is certain that we must lag behind many continental countries.71. Only two methods have been suggested of dealing with this menace of civil aviation. One is the internationalisation of civil aviation, in such a way that no one country would at any moment have complete control of sufficient suitable machines, personnel and material to afford it a chance of bringing off a successful aggression. The other is the formation of a central international military air force at the disposal of the League. It is maintained by those who advocate this scheme that such a force, even though it were comparatively small, would be able to deal rapidly and effectively with any force of converted machines likely to be brought into action by any one country.72. No detailed scheme for an international Air Force has even yet been submitted. There are indications that the French are likely to submit&apos; one at the Disarmament Conference.73.   Our expert advisers are extremely sceptical as to its possibilities.74. If it could be brought into the realm of practical politics, and if it would permit the abolition of national air forces, that alone might justify the Disarmament Conference by the removal of the threat of air warfare and by the resulting financial saving.
We recommend (a) That although the idea of abolishing military aircraft is attractive, it will not be properly effective unless some satisfactory method can be found by which civil aircraft can be prevented from being used for offensive purposes.(5) That since proposals of this kind are at present extremely nebulous, the United Kingdom Delegation should be allowed to use their discretion in dealing with these points as they arise, subject to the proviso that if any matters of principle affecting the defence of this country should arise the final decision must be referred to the Cabinet.(d) Armaments Generally.(i) The Prohibition of all Offensive Weapons.75. The Chiefs of Staff have studied this question. They have confirmed the report of a special League Commission appointed to consider this question, which recommended that no distinctions were possible between offensive and defensive weapons, and that the only weapons that could really be classed as purely defensive were such things as concrete emplacements, &amp;c, on which guns could be mounted.76. On the other hand we must remember that we have forbidden the ex-enemy States the possession of certain weapons. These were apparently selected on account of their offensive potentialities. If we agree that there is no distinction between offensive and defensive weapons, and if we wish to maintain these particular prohibitions on these States, we must find some other justification.Recommendation.We recommend That we should not support any proposal for the prohibition of all offensive weapons, on the grounds that such distinctions do not appear to be possible. We think that the United Kingdom Delegation must be allowed some discretion in dealing with this matter, because certain arguments have been put forward to prove that because enemy States were deprived of offensive weapons after the War, therefore such prohibition is possible. It is believed, however, that the intention of the framers of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles was to allow Germany only sufficient forces for the maintenance of the integrity of her frontiers and for the maintenance of internal order.(ii) The Prohibition of all Preparation for Chemical Warfare.77. Article 39 of the Draft Convention embodies the terms of the Geneva Gas Protocol, by which countries undertake, subject to reciprocity, not to use poisonous gases or liquids in war, and also undertake unreservedly to abstain from the use of all bacteriological methods of warfare.78. It has been suggested that endeavours should be made to restrict the manufacture of gas in peace time, and the German delegation have inserted a reservation in the Draft Convention to this effect.79. It seems impracticable to apply any such restrictions, when it is remem-bered that plant suitable for making poisonous gases is in daily commercial use in many countries for purposes not connected with war at all. It is admitted that all countries are making full preparations to defend themselves against gas attack, and, in order to do so, are manufacturing all kinds of offensive gases, presumably in small quantities, in order to make more efficient their means of defence; but unless some form of drastic inspection on the spot is introduced it seems impossible to prohibit preparations in peace time, ana, even with super-vision, as we know in Germany, evasions would be comparatively simple.[6356J e
R ecommendation.We recommend (a) That we should support Article 39 of the Draft Convention, whichforbids the use of poisonous gases, &amp;c, in war.(b) That we should not support any proposals for the restriction of themanufacture of gas in peace time, on the grounds that such restric-tions are impracticable.(iii) The Restriction of the Manufacture of Armaments.80. Under Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, the manufacture of arma-ments in Germany was strictly limited. Here, again, this was possible only by reason of the condition in which Germany was placed, and was capable of enforcement only by rigid inspection and the destruction of all surplus material. It is not possible to contemplate any State not situated as Germany then was agreeing to the drastic provisions which were enforced in Germany.Recommendation.We recommend That we should not support any idea for the restriction of the manufac-ture of armaments, on the grounds that no such restrictions are capable of enforcement without a form of rigid inspection, which it is not possible to contemplate.(iv) The idea that forces should be limited so as to prevent an aggressorsucceeding with a knock-out blow.81. Some prominence has been given to this idea in Resolution 3 of the Three-Party Resolutions, together with the idea that the aim at the Disarmament Conference should be to give security to all States. It is understood that the idea underlying this proposal is that each country should, so far as possible, have a strength in proportion to its neighbour, sufficient to hold up an invasion the length of time necessary for the organization of the forces of other members of the League against the aggressor.82. It has been pointed out, also, that it is obviously impossible to give every State security against another, for this would imply that, e.g., Denmark should be able to resist attack by Germany. In view of the inevitability of States maintaining different sizes of forces, the idea of preventing a knock-out blow, however desirable it might be, does not seem to be practicable, more especially in view of the development of air forces to-day..83. On this point, see paragraphs 18-26 inclusive of the Report of Mr. Cadogan&apos;s Committee.Recommendation.We recommend That it does not appear necessary to put forward any recommendation on the idea that forces should be limited so as to prevent an aggressor succeeding with a knock-out blow. The aim of this idea is obviously excellent, but we do not think it is possible to apply it in practice, and, since the suggestion emanated from the Three-Party Resolutions, it is not very likely that it will be raised at the Disarmament Conference.Summary of Recommendations.84. We suggest that the instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation to the Disarmament Conference should be based on the following recommendations; but we would draw particular attention to the fact that, in certain cases, no definite recommendation can be framed until prior consultation with the Dominions has been held, and in others it would appear desirable to allow some latitude to our Delegation to act in accordance with the varying circumstances which may arise and which are difficult to forecast beforehand : 
The Draft Convention.Articles 2-4 (Effectives).1. That the method of limitation of effectives in the land, sea and air forces on the lines of Articles 2-4 of the Draft Disarmament Convention should be supported. We fully realise that if every nation, while adopting this method of limitation, claims for itself a higher maximum than it has at present reached, no general disarmament will be secured by applying this method. Nevertheless, the fixing of maxima at as low a figure as possible is a method which we are bound to approve (paragraphs 5-7).Articles 5-9 (Period of Service).2. That as a general principle we should support any proposal for the abolition of conscription. We realise, however, that this is a somewhat contentious subject, and that it is possible that to raise it at the Conference might prove a source of irritation to countries now employing the conscription system without any likelihood of getting the proposal to abolish conscription accepted. We would suggest, therefore, that the instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation on this point should be so framed as to allow them latitude either to advocate the abolition of conscription, if circumstances prove favourable, or to adopt a non-committal attitude if, in their opinion, such a course might prove wiser. We would also point out that to advocate the abolition of conscription would be definitely to support Germany against France, and for political reasons it is possible that such a course may prove undesirable (paragraphs 8-10).Article 10 (Land War Material).3. That we should support the method of limitation of land war material as proposed in Article 10 of the draft Convention. We appreciate that to limit land armaments only by means of restricting the amounts spent thereon, falls a long Avaj7 short of the limitation imposed on Germany under Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, but we also realise that the difficulties of limiting all kinds of land weapons, including the smaller varieties, e.g., machine guns, rifles, &amp;c. are almost insuperable, and we think, therefore, that in practice, the indirect method is likely to prove the most effective (paragraphs 11-18).Articles 11-23 (Naval War Material).4. (a) That we should support the method of limitation of naval armaments as proposed in Articles 11-23 of the draft Convention, and, in particular, we should strongly support the proposal that nothing should be done in the draft Convention to invalidate or amend the Washington and London Naval Treaties (paragraphs 19-20).(b) That one method and perhaps the simplest of securing that nothing is done, to jeopardise the Washington and London Naval Treaties would be to provide that the naval clauses of the Disarmament Convention should co-terminate with these Treaties. As it is possible, however, that other methods of securing this desideratum may be suggested we think that discretion should be left to the United Kingdom delegation as to the method of securing this principle (paragraph 20).(c) That we should make every effort to induce France and Italy to modify the claims which they are at present putting forward under Part III of the London Naval Treaty. Unless the final figures submitted are satisfactory from our point of view, we think our delegation should be instructed to reserve our position under Part III of the London Naval Treaty. It is possible that this matter will not have been settled before the Disarmament Conference, and it may, therefore, be necessary either to allow our delegation some latitude in regard to this point, or else to instruct them to refer the question back for decision by the Cabinet when it arises (paragraph 21).(d) That we should endeavour to get the demands of the smaller maritime Powers for the creation of naval forces of appreciable sizes reduced as far as possible, particularly claims for the construction of submarine fleets. The majority of these smaller and newly created States possess no naval forces of any significance at present, and it is, therefore, undesirable that the Disarmament Conference should be used as a medium for the creation of forces which might otherwise not be contemplated at all (paragraph 22).-  [6356] e 2
(e) That we should endeavour to obtain acceptance of the idea that the standards of limitation of German naval forces should be the same as those under the Washington and London Naval Treaties. In putting forward this recom-mendation we are not wishing to imply that any increase should be permitted in the numbers and tonnage of the forces allowed to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, but rather that Germany should be prevented from producing vessels of a freak nature, which may conceivably lead to a competition of an undesirable nature. We realise fully that this suggestion impinges on matters of some delicacy and would require extremely careful handling at the Disarmament Conference, and we suggest, therefore, that while our delegation should be told that we support the principle of one universal form of limitation of naval armaments, they are left discretion as to the method by which they put forward this proposal and even given latitude not to put this proposal forward at all, if it is likely merely to cause difficulties in the Conference without any likelihood of success (paragraphs 22 and 23).Article 24 (Naval War Material Budgetary Limitation).5. (a) That, in view of the fact that acceptance of the limitation of annual expenditure on naval war material, as proposed in Article 24 of the Draft Convention, affects intimately the division of expenditure between this country and the Dominions and may involve difficulties of adjustment, no final decision should be given on this article of the Convention until discussions have taken place with representatives of the Dominions, which it is hoped to arrange at an early date. In any case, however, we recommend that if other maritime Powers do not accept this limitation of annual expenditure we should not accept it either (paragraphs 24-27 and 29-30).(b) That if the limitation of annual expenditure is accepted we should insist that it is without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaties of Washington and London; that is to say, the budgetary figures should enable us to construct and maintain the full amount of tonnage allowed to us under those Treaties (paragraph 28).Articles 25-28 (Air War Material).fi. (a) That we should accept the method of direct limitation of military aircraft of all kinds by limiting the number in commission and in immediate reserve, as proposed in Articles 25-28 of the Draft Disarmament Convention (jDaragraph 31).(b) That the additional limitation of total horsepower of aircraft in commission and in immediate reserve, also proposed under Articles 25-28 of the Draft Disarmament Convention, is right in principle, but we have doubts as to the wisdom of accepting this additional form of limitation because we are advised that the application of the limitation of horsepower is impracticable and is capable of extremely easy evasion. A method of limiting horsepower has been proposed by a Sub-Committee of the League, but it is understood that this method is not considered satisfactory. We think, therefore, it might be advisable to instruct our Delegation to the effect that, while we accept the idea of limitation of horsepower in principle, we reserve our actual acceptance of this form of limitation unless a really satisfactory method can be found. In other words, our Delegation should be allowed to use their discretion in this matter (paragraph 40).(c) That we should support the provisions of Article 28, which seek to prevent the use of civil aviation directly to supplement military aviation (paragraph 28).(d) That, while realising fully the weight of the Air Ministry&apos;s contention that, in view of the vulnerability of this country to air attack, we ought not to accept any limitation of metropolitan aircraft inferior to that of the strongest Continental Power capable of attacking this country from the air, we feel that to -claim parity with Prance, as the proposal implies, is to go to the Disarmament Conference asking for the right to double the strength of our air forces maintained in the United Kingdom. Since, however, this is a matter which vitally affects the security of this country, we hesitate to recommend definitely that we should accept a lower figure than France, and we propose that the first step should be a strong endeavour to get France to reduce the size of her air(
forces. If this should prove impossible, then we think our numbers should be framed on a basis which will afford us reasonable security in the light of the figures France proposes to insert in the Draft Convention.(e) That the quota allowed for overseas aircraft should be based solely on our requirements in the different overseas theatres, allowing perhaps a small margin for contingencies, and that the Air Ministry should be instructed to submit figures on this basis (paragraph 39).(/) That it is very important to prevent a competition in ship-borne aircraft, and that negotiations should be opened with the United States with a view to arriving at some agreed basis which will obviate the necessity of any increase beyond the real needs, of our fleet air arm. In any such negotiations we feel strongly that no attempt should be made to alter the basis of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and that the method of limiting the number of aircraft to be carried would consequently appear to be that most likely to prove acceptable. We feel that some latitude must be left to our Delegation to conduct these negotiations as best they can, and, if necessary, to refer any important matters of principle raised to the Cabinet for decision (paragraph 41).(g) That although no provision is made at present in the Draft Disarma-ment Convention for the limitation of expenditure on air war material, there appear to be some grounds for accepting such limitation. The Committee of the League has reported that such limitation is feasible, and we suggest that our Delegation should be instructed not to oppose the addition of separate budgetary limitation for air war material if such a proposal is brought up and is likely to be generally accepted at the Disarmament Conference (paragraphs 31-33).Article 29 (Total Budgetary Expenditure).7. That, although we recommend, in principle, acceptance of the proposal that there should be a separate total expenditure limitation for each of the three Services, we desire to reserve our recommendation on Article 29 of the Draft Disarmament Convention until we have discussed with representatives of the Dominions the problems - connected with the proposal to apply budgetary limitation to naval war material and total naval expenditure.(Note. We have not consulted the Treasury in framing our recommen-dations on budgetary limitation. We realise that this question raises certain principles in which the Treasury may be vitally interested, and we suggest therefore that before any final decision is taken the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be sought) (paragraphs 42-46).Articles 30-38 (Exchange of Information).8. (a) That we should accept the machinery proposed in Articles 30-34 and 36-38 of the Draft Disarmament Convention for the exchange of information as to the size of the armed forces of each country and the sums of money spent on them. As Article 35 raises a point on which further discussion may be necessary at Geneva, we suggest that the final decision be left to our Delegation to determine (paragraph 47).(b) That there would be no objection to accepting in principle the idea of . publicity of reserves of personnel, since this information .is readily available whether official publicity exists or not. On the other hand, it is difficult to divorce publicity of reserves of personnel from publicity of reserves of material, and we are impressed with the idea that it would be definitely detrimental to our security to press for publicity of material and we recommend therefore we should not support the idea of any publicity of reserves at all (paragraphs 48-53).(c) That there is no objection to dealing with the question of civil aviation in a separate Convention instead of including certain publicity as is proposed in Article 37. We suggest that discretion should be allowed to our Delegation as to the attitude they adopt in accordance with the discussion as it may develop at the Conference (paragraph 54).(d) That we should not support any idea of internationalising civil or military aviation. We do not think that any such proposals are really practicable, and we are doubtful whether, if adopted, this form of force might not react to our disadvantage in view of our peculiar situation, and the lack of civil aviation facilities in this country (paragraph 55).
Articles 40-49 (Permanent Disarmament Commission).9. (a) That we should accept the proposal to set up a permanent Disarmament Commission to supervise the execution of the Draft Convention as proposed in Articles 40-49 of the Draft Convention (paragraph 56).(6). That we should oppose any suggestions to apply any system of super-vision which might imply the right of inspection on the spot (paragraph 56).Article 50 (Derogations).10. That we should accept the provisions of Article 50 of the Draft Dis-armament Convention whereby, under special circumstances, States are given the right to suspend temporarily any provision or provisions of the Convention, (paragraph 57).Articles 51-52 (Procedure regarding Complaints).11. That we should accept the method of dealing with complaints proposed in Articles 51-52 of the draft Disarmament Convention (paragraph 58).Articles 53-60 (Final Provisions).12. That the final provisions of the Draft Convention as set out in Articles 53-60 should be accepted subject to the proviso which we have already noted, that it may be found desirable to press for the naval clauses of the Convention to co-terminate with the Washington and London Naval Treaties (paragraphs 59-61).Suggestions for A bolishing or Limiting Specific Weapons.13. (a) Naval Armaments.(i) The Reduction in Size or A bolition of Capital Ships.That we should support the idea of a substantial reduction in the size of capital ships. In view of the fact that the United States strongly opposed this suggestion at the London Naval Conference, but are believed recently to have modified this attitude, it might be better to allow the suggestion to emanate from the United States. We suggest that the method of handling this proposal should be left to the discretion of the United Kingdom Delegation (paragraph 63).(ii) The Abolition of the Submarine.(a) That we should support any proposal for the abolition of submarines. In view of the fact that France and Japan and a number of other States are believed to be firmly opposed to the abolition of the submarine, we suggest that the handling of any such suggestion should be left to the discretion of the United Kingdom Delegation (paragraph 64).(b) That if it is found impossible to get any limitation of submarines accepted, we should propose that all maritime States should adhere to Part IV of the London Naval Treaty, which embodies rules of war for submarines against merchant vessels (paragraph 65).(b) Land Armaments.(i) The Prohibition of all Guns above a Certain Calibre.That we should not put forward any suggestion for the prohibition of all guns above a certain calibre, but that if any reasonable suggestion of this nature is put forward and seems likely to be generally acceptable, we should not oppose it (paragraph 66).(ii) The A bolition or Restriction of Tanks.That we should not put forward any idea to abolish or restrict tanks. In view of the restrictions placed upon Germany by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, however, this question may need rather delicate handling (para-graphs 67-68).
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 11, 1932.o(c) Air Armaments.The Abolition of Military Aircraft.(a) That although the idea of abolishing military aircraft is attractive, it will not be properly effective unless some satisfactory method can be found by which civil aircraft can be prevented from being used for offensive purposes (paragraphs 69-70).(b) That since proposals of this kind are at present extremely nebulous, the United Kingdom Delegation should be allowed to use their discretion in dealing with these points as they arise, subject to the proviso that, if any matters of principle affecting the defence of this country should arise, the final decision must be referred to the Cabinet (paragraphs 71-74).(d) Armaments Generally.(i) The Prohibition of all Offensive Weapons.That we should not support any proposal for the prohibition of all offensive weapons, on the grounds that such distinctions do not appear to be possible. We think that the United Kingdom Delegation must be allowed some discretion in dealing with this matter, because certain arguments have been put forward to prove that because enemy States were deprived of offensive weapons after the War, therefore such prohibition is possible. It is believed, however, that the intention of the framers of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles was to allow Germany only sufficient forces for the maintenance of the integrity of her frontiers and for the maintenance of internal order (paragraphs 75-76).(ii) The Prohibition of all Preparation for Chemical Warfare.(a) That we should support Article 39 of the Draft Convention, which forbids the use of poisonous gases, &amp;c, in war (paragraph 77).(b) That we should not support any proposals for the restriction of the manufacture of gas in peace time, on the grounds that such restrictions are impracticable (paragraphs 78-79).(iii) The Restriction of the Manufacture of Armaments.That we should not support any idea for the restriction of the manufacture of armaments, on the grounds that no such restrictions are capable of enforcement without a form of rigid inspection, which it is not possible to contemplate (paragraph 80).(iv) The Idea that Forces should be limited so as to prevent an A ggressorsucceeding with a knock-out blow.That it does not appear&apos; necessary to put forward any recommendation on the idea that forces should be limited so as to prevent an aggressor succeeding with a knock-out blow. The aim of this idea is obviously excellent, but we do not think it is possible to apply it in practice, and since the suggestion emanated from the Three-Party Resolutions, it is not very likely that it will be raised at the Disarmament Conference (paragraphs 81-83).(Signed) JOHN SIMON (Chairman).J.
