0 O fiRETo,24(32).(This Doc\:.ment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)iCABINET.Programme of New Construction for 1952. Memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltycThe New Construction Programme which I ask the Cabinet to approve for submission to Parliament with the Navy Estimates for 1932 consists of the following vessels:-2 Cruisers  (LEANDEE class)1 small Cruiser (aEETKUSA class)1 Leader and 8 Destroyers.3 Submarines (one of the &quot;G&quot; or Fleet type, one Minelayer Submarine, and one VS&quot; or Patrol type).4 Sloops.1 Destroyer Depot Ship. 1 Shallow Draught Gunboat,and small craft (namely one Boom Defence Vessel,one Tug, two Tenders, 3 Lighters).This Programme of Cruisers, Destroyers, and Submarines represents what was described to Parliament last year as the norjial annual instalment of warship building under the London Naval Treaty.     Actually, as is well, known, thisnormal instalment provides for only about half the annual replacement in respect of Destroyers that would be necessaryin order to give us our full quota of under-age Destroyersi&apos;       ---- &quot;    1...........under the Treaty,, apart from any - quest ion of additional building under Article 21 of the Treaty (the so-called Escalator clause).Of the other vessels:-The four Sloops correspond with the annual replacement of 4 to 5 vessels a year necessary to maintain the required numbers of this useful and economical type:The new Destroyer Depot Ship is required to replaceH.M,S.SANDHURST (the Depot Ship of the Destroyer Flotillasof/
- 2 - .of&quot; the Mediterranean Fleet) which is nearing the end of her effective liie:-By 1936, when the new ship will he ready for service, the SANDHURST will he 30 years old and past the age of economical repair:The River Gunboat is to replace H.M.S.MOORHEN, which is now serving in China in the West River Flotilla, and is already 31 years old.The email Cruiser is intended to be of the same type as the small Fleet Cruiser included &quot;in the 1931 Programme,      It was originally anticipated that the require-ments for a ship of this class could be provided on a displacement of about 5,000 tons, but partly in order to provide more adequate accommodation for the ship&apos;s company, and partly because the recent EMPEROR OF INDIA experiments have made it necessary to adopt a re-arrangement of the machinery spaces in order to increase their safety when the ship is in action, the disp3.acement must be increased to about 5,500 tons.      This change also necessitates a slight increase in cost (from  1 .-,350,000 to  1,400,000).On the assumption that the ships will not be ordered until nearly the end of the financial year, the money proposed to be provided in 1932 to start the programme is only  30,000.A financial statement showing the total estimated cost of the progz^amme and the manner in which the expenditure would normally be spread over the years of building is attached.(Intdo)      B.
