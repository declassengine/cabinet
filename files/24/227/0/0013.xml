THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1932.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    KOCP. 13 (32).CABINET.AT the suggestion of the Prime Minister, I circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a note on some of the international aspects of reparations and debts.J. S.January 9, 1932.REPARATIONS AND DEBTS-A BIRDS-EYE VIEW.1. IF it were not for the Hoover moratorium suspending inter-govern-mental payments till the 1st July, 1932, those payments in 1931-32 would be approximately as follows (reichsmarks converted into  s at 20 to  1 and depreciation of sterling being ignored) : Germany should  be paying   77 million  in  reparations  ( 47  million conditional,  30 million unconditional).France should be (a) Receiving about  40 million of the above ( 17 million of theconditional,  23 million of the unconditional);and (b) Paying away, as an instalment of her war debt,  23^- million( 13Jj million to Britain^) and  10,300,000 to America);thus keeping for herself  16J million (her &quot; solde &quot;).Britain should be (a) Receiving From Germany,  14^ million reparations ( 12^- million con-ditional,  2 million unconditional); From France,  12^ million war debt, plus  815,000 Hagueannuity;From other ex-Allies,  5f million war debt and Hague annuities;Total,  33^ million; From the Dominions (although these debts are on a different footing),  9^ million; and should be (b) Paying approximately(2) the same sum (actually  32,800,000 thisyear) to America as an instalment of her war debt.(!) /.(;., war debt  !2i million and &quot;Hague annuity&quot;  815,000. As the French debt to us is payable in sterling-, France would profit by its depreciation and would be able to retain a larger portion of German reparations than was contemplated.   The Hague annuity is calculated in gold.(2) There is a surplus of . 700,000 a year which goes towards the excess of payments to America over receipts before the Balfour Note.6159   [6408] b
America should be receiving in gold the above-i-1 32,800,000 from Britain; 10,300,000 from France;  3,250,000 from other war-debtors;  4,000,000 relief debts;  3,200,000 reparations;Total    53,550,000.2. It follows from the above figures that, if there was a final wiping-out of both war debts and reparations Germany would be relieved from paying an annual sum (averaging  100 million), which is now  77 million (excluding the service of the Young Loan), and which under the Young plan rises in 1966 to  120 million, and then falls to  80 million, and ends only in 1988.France would lose her annual &quot; solde &quot; (net surplus of reparation receipts, including deliveries in kind, over payments for war debts), at present amounting to about  16 million.(Belgium would similarly lose a &quot; solde &quot; of  3^ million.)Britain, apart from debts due from the Dominions, would neither gain nor lose any very substantial amount, but would be left permanently saddled with the large excess of her payments in respect of the war debt to America over her receipts from reparations and war debts ( 200 million, allowing for interest at 5 per cent, on both sides of the account). If Dominion debts, &amp;c, were also wiped out (in spite of the very different considerations involved), Britain would lose nearly  10 million a year, or two-thirds of the loss suffered by France.America would lose all her receipts of war debts. They total about  4,500 million, spread over sixty years; this year&apos;s instalment would be  53,550,000 gold (see end of paragraph 1), i.e. (if one confines oneself to the payments themselves without estimating economic consequences), Germany would gain enormously; France would lose materially; America would lose heavily; but Britain would remain unaffected (assuming payment by the Dominions to continue) so far as balance of receipts and payments is concerned.3. Britaihs position as the party whose balance of receipts and payments is (on the above assumption) unaffected by all-round cancellation will provoke the criticism that it is easy to urge sacrifice on others when yo\i do not join in it yourself.   But (a) We have set an example of generosity in dealing with inter-Allied debts. We remitted two-thirds of France&apos;s debt to us, because in 1926 France appeared to be unable to transfer the payments required to discharge her obligations in full. By the Balfour Note we disclaimed the receipt of any balance of payments beyond what was needed to meet our debt to America. The size of that debt is itself due to. our having placed our own surplus production at the disposal -of our European Allies instead of selling it for cash, which Avould have paid for our American purchases. It has been funded on terms far more onerous than the French debt; if we had been given the terms afterwards conceded to France, the Treasury calculate that, instead of having paid to America  268 million since 1923, we should have paid only  84 million. If the British -debt were now retrospectively treated on French funding terms, we should, in view of the  268 million already paid, have nothing more to pay till 1939; and(b) If there is no all-round suspension or reduction (i) Germany will be unable to pay on the Young scale when the Hoover year ends;(ii) France will declare herself unable to pay either America or ourselves; ; - and(iii) Britain cannot pay America.
4. It is well to consider what course. would be open, in ,the absence of a new agreement, to the disappointed parties in the events (i), (ii) and (iii) above.5. As for (i), Germany has bound herself in the most solemn manner to pay to the Bank for International Settlements the annuities prescribed in the Young plan. That plan was in terms accepted by all parties, including Germany, &apos;&apos; as a complete and final settlement &quot; (article 1 of The Hague Agreement, the 20th January, 1930; cf. Debt Certificate of German Government, which is Annex III of that agreement). It was never contemplated by the authors of the plan that circumstances could arise in which the unconditional annuities could not be paid and transferred indeed, they prided themselves in their report that the figure of the unpostponable annuity was fixed so low &quot;as to remove every possibility of the risk of error,&quot; and justified it as a deliberate under-estimate of what Germany could certainly do without weakening her credit (paragraph 8 (c) of the report). Hence the Transfer Committee of the Dawes plan (which had the task of regulating transfers of reparation payments from marks into foreign currencies, so as not to threaten the stability of German currency) was dispensed with under the Young plan. And the anticipation has proved equally wdde of the actual course of events in the case of the postponable annuities of the Young plan, for (a) all that was provided against was &quot;the possible consequence of a comparatively short period of depression &apos;&apos;; (&amp;) it was assumed that any danger would be adequately guarded against by allowing a ninety days&apos; notice to postpone transfer into foreign currencies for a period not exceeding two years; and (c) it was contemplated that, even if transfer was thus postponed, payment in marks of the annuities would be made to the Bank for International Settlements.All this is now found by the report of the Basle Advisory Committee to be quite inadequate to meet this emergency. The committee, though primarily concerned in ascertaining the justification for Germany&apos;s declaration that she will not be able in the year beginning in July next to transfer the conditional part of the annuity, adds that it must &quot; draw the attention of the Governments to the unprecedented gravity of the crisis, the magnitude of which undoubtedly exceeds the &apos; relatively short depression &apos; envisaged by the Young plan, to meet which the &apos; measures of safeguard &apos; were designed.&quot;And the experts go on to point out that the Young plan, with its rising series of annuities, contemplated a steady expansion in world trade, not merely in volume but in value, in which the annuities payable by Germany would become a factor of diminishing importance, whereas, in fact, not only has the trade of the world shrunk in volume, but the exceptional fall in gold prices has added greatly to the real burden not only of German annuities, but of all payments fixed in gold.If Germany, without any new agreement being reached, now fails to make the Young payments, the question might arise under Annex I of The Hague Agreement &quot; whether the German Government has committed acts revealing its determination to destroy the Young plan.&quot; This question would have to be decided by the Permanent Court of International Justice, and it is only in the event of the court giving an affirmative answer that the creditor Powers could &quot; resume their full liberty of action.&quot;In the unlikely event of France, on Germany&apos;s failure to pay forthwith, going into the Rhineland, that wrould be an invasion of Germany within article 2 of the Locarno Treaty, and if it amounted to a &quot; flagrant violation of article 2,&quot; then Britain has undertaken immediately to come to the help of Germany as soon as Britain &quot; has been able to satisfy itself that this violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression.&quot; Even if, as the result of the decision of The Hague Court, the creditor Powers resumed their full liberty of action, this could not of itself authorise the invasion of Germany and the same considerations would apply. But before all this could occur, Germany, alleging a violation of article 2, might bring the question at once before the Council of the League.And it may well be doubted whether France, in the event of Germany&apos;s default, would injure her own case by a breach of article 2 of the Locarno Treaty. Her alternative is to proceed to secure settlement by peaceful means under article 3.
6. As for (ii), when the French Parliament ratified the debt settlements-with America and Britain in July 1929 the Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution stressing the relation of the payment of German reparations to the French payment of debts; nevertheless both the agreements actually ratified and now in force were and are unconditional agreements. In the case of the British settlement the agreement which, though ratified in 1929, had been concluded in 1926 was accompanied by an exchange of letters between M. Caillaux and Mr. Churchill. In these M. Caillaux reserves the right to ask for reconsider a-tion if transfers from Germany fall below half what is due from France to the United States of America and Britain; but Mr. Churchill only assented to this, statement subject to the observation that the settlement depended, like the debt itself, on the sole credit of France, and that &quot;in the hypothetical circumstances mentioned Great Britain would already have suffered a diminution of the receipts from the Dawes scheme, which we had taken into account in arriving at the various debt settlements, and this was one of the factors which would have to be borne in mind in the event of any reconsideration of the question being desired by the French Government. The effect of Mr. ChurchilPs words is that if it comes to reconsideration His Majestys&apos; Government are not committed to a revision of the agreement in France&apos;s favour.7. As for (iii), there is also nothing in our debt settlement with America entitling Britain to suspend jmyments if we do not receive reparations from. Germany, or debts from France or Italy. We need a sort of inverted Balfour Note, explaining that we cannot in the future pay over more than we receive.(3)&apos; The American Senate rejects all such argument: the message of Mr. Hoover to-Congress insists that debts and reparations are not connected : and already one hears in certain quarters of America the cool suggestion that Britain might make good its default by transferring to the United States the West Indian. Colonies.8. This analysis reinforces the necessity for reaching a new agreement. Such an agreement might conceivably take the form of an agreement between the creditor Powers, leaving Germany out. That is to say, the Young plan would still, in the view of the creditor Powers, apply to Germany, but they would agree amongst themselves that there should be a temporary suspension of effective payments. The advantage of this method, perhaps, is that it does not necessitate Germany putting her hand to an agreement which recognises a liability, even contingently, to resume payments after an interval. The better alternative, if it can be brought about, is an agreement to which Germany also is a party. This is more satisfactory for the French since it leaves France with the comfort that the Young plan survives and the postponement is a modification within its framework. Moreover, this would best satisfy the requirements formulated by A.merica that Europe should first reach an agreement about reparations and then should approach America to see what she would do about debts. Suspension of reparation payments for a period, with the provision that resumption thereafter should only take place if an impartial body declare it to be feasible, would be the most likely line to meet German susceptibilities and yet keep the Young plan nominally intact. But the formula is very difficult to devise, since it ought to be capable of being represented to German public opinion as the end of reparations and to French public opinion as their resumption hereafter!9. If, then, an agreement is to be devised, by what method can it be pursued ? In tackling the chain Germany-France-Britain-America the difficulty is to know at which end to begin. In the present atmosphere it seems pretty hopeless to begin at the American end. The arguments that had no effective weight when the United States were prosperous will cut no ice when America has ten million unemployed. Even if the prospect of persuading American opinion were greater than it is, the utmost that could be expected would be that the rate of interest on the British debt should be reduced to the lower rate of interest on the French debt. That would only relieve our burden by one-half (assuming the adjustment not to(3) Indeed, the Balfour Note may be said to imply this. Consider the following- extracts : It cannot, be right, that one partner in the common enterprise should recover all that she has lent, and that another, while recovering nothing, should be required to pay all that she has borrowed..... In no-circumstances do we propose to ask more from our debtors than is necessary to pay to our creditors.. And, while we do not ask for more, all &quot;ill admit that we can hardly be content, with less.&quot;
be made retrospectively) and where is the balance to come from if Germany can&apos;t pay France and France won&apos;t pay us? Moreover, tackling the matter from the American end, even if our rate of interest were reduced, might result in Britain&apos;s being morally committed to pay the smaller sum at the very time when France and Italy are refusing to pay anything at all. The deduction, therefore, is that we must begin from the German end of the chain.10. Here we start with a proposition which no independent judgment can challenge. Germany cannot pay reparations, and it is quite uncertain how soon the time will arrive when she can pay them. This is the unanimous view of the experts at Basle, and they include four neutrals. It is therefore inevitable that the source from which France intended to pay her debt to Britain and America is drying up and no one can say when it will be possible for the stream to reflow. The first proposition which ought to be agreed at the Reparations Conference, therefore, is that Germany cannot be required to pay the stipulated annuities, Avhether conditional or unconditional, when the 1st July comes. There must be an interval.11. The second proposition is that that interval must be (ai) long enough to give Germany a chance to recover by the restoration of confidence in her finances-without which investors will not- lend to her, and (6) for a length of time which cannot now be definitely fixed in advance. It is quite illogical for the French memorandum to speak of two years as the maximum possible period of depression. The two years is borrowed from a clause in the Young Plan, which provides for suspending the transfer of the conditional annuities, but the existing depression is something which the Young Plan never contemplated at all. The minimum period ought to be, say, five years, with a proviso which would automatically extend it, unless by that time conditions of prosperity had so returned that Germany could resume some portion of her payments.12. Next comes the question of the French and Italian debts to this country. If Germany does not pay France, we shall have to accept it that France does not pay us, for France will decline to do so. Our object ought to be to insist that no arrangement is possible which leaves France with some payments from Germany while France refuses to make any payment to us. In other words, France must give up her &quot; solde.&quot; What bargaining counters have we which might induce France to do this? We have only two. The first is the suspension of the war debt and Hague annuity payments from France to ourselves. These, however, at present only amount to a little over  13 million (sterling), whereas France&apos;s-&quot; solde,&quot; if both conditional and unconditional annuities were paid, amounts to  16 million (gold). The only other inducement we can offer is that of joining-hands with France in representing to America that, in view of the ceasing of German reparations, we consider that the debtor Powers will have to suspend payments to America. This is an inducement of some value to France, not because she would not be prepared to act single-handedly (for she would say she could not pay and America could not make her), but because her moral position in refusing to pay is much worse than ours. In fact, France could pay if she wished to do so, notwithstanding that reparations ceased. In this respect France is in a much better position than Britain. Under the terms of the Franco-American Debt Settlement they have the right to suspend 60 per cent, of their debt to the United States for three years and can avoid the discredit associated with default for a paltry 38 million dollars a year. Britain, however, can only postpone for two years about one-fifth of our annuity and must pay 150 million dollars a year to avoid default. Britain has a far stronger moral claim for consideration. Consequently, co-operation with France on this head is worth something to France. On the other hand, it would sacrifice the great moral advantage we have in American eyes. Our claim for consideration is much more effective if we do not join France in filing a sort of joint petition in bankruptcy13. I presume that all the discussions at the Reparations Conference on the subject of the suspension of reparations and the suspension of the payment of France&apos;s debt to us would be impliedly conditioned by the proviso that what was being discussed could only be carried out if there was a corresponding suspension of debt payments to America. There is, so far as I can see, no other course. I [6408] c
do not think America will come to the Reparations Conference at all. She will say it is none of her business and that the European countries must settle these things amongst themselves. We must therefore do our best to do so, and, if possible, present America with an agreement which (1) Suspends reparations for a substantial period;(2) Provides that there will be no renewal of them save under conditionswhen Germany can pay; (3) Suspends payment of debts to Britain by France and other ex-allies for asimilar period; and (4) Leaves us in the position of being able to say to America that we havereached agreement with Germany and France, and that we now look to America to agree to a corresponding adjustment.J.
