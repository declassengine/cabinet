0 r5 ^(\i        ijHIS DOCUMENT IS, THE J?ROPERTY.....OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^.S !GOVEfflNlMENT.SECRET COPY NO.        ^CAB IN B T.UNEIvgLOYlCSNT INSURANCE, EXTENSION OF TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. MenoraBduri Toy the Minister of Labour.It will he necessary to pass before Easter a short Bill further extending the ,Hransitj^nalmperiod,, during which payments under the Transitional Payments Scheme nay be made to claimants who have not got the &quot;30 contribu-tions&quot; qualification under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme propero     Under existing legislation the power to make transitional payments to this class of claimant will begin automatically to expire on 18th April next, and will finally run out in April, 1933.      The number of individuals concerned is over half a million.It will,  of course, he necessary when the Report of ^^the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance is received to make a general review of the insurance and transitional payments schemes and probably to pass a comprehensive Bill. The Report:&apos;.of the Commission will nob? however, be received for some time yet, and it seems clear that any legislation based on it will not be passed before next year.Under existing legislation certain important provisions in tho unemployment insurance scheme expire on 30th June,1933, so that it will be necessary to pass general legislation before that date.     We could not, I think,  in any event contemplate a shorter extension pf the transitional/period
period than twelve months from 18th April, and in view of the expiration of the  existing provisions I have mentioned on 30th June, 1933, it would obviously he convenient to have the transitional period extended to the same date.I should mention that the extension will not affect the conditions under which benefit and transitional payments are paid;    in particular,   the &quot;&quot;needs&quot; test will continue to he applied to transitional payments in accordance with the Order in Council.The White Paper on the National Economy Bill (Cmd. 395 ) tacitly assumed that the transitional period would he extended, and allowed for this in the estimates which it gave for the year 1932/33.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurs in the proposed extension to 30th June, 1933, subject to consideration of any point which may arise on the draft Bill when it is ready.I ask for authority to introduce the necessary 3ill and to pass it through all its stages before the Easter &quot;Recess.(Intld.) H.3.16th January, 1955.
