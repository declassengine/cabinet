CP.14(32) --------DISARMAMENT      CONFER EN CE.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on Policy in regard to the Limitation of Naval Armaments.To supplement the Report of the Cabinet -Disarmament Committee (CP. 5 (32)) I circulate to the Cabinet particulars in regard, to the figures proposed by the Admiralty for Naval limitation,,The Draft Convention will limit -(1)    Ships of war in certain categories, by total tonnage and in other ways: (2)    Ship-borne aircraft (In their capacity as onecomponent of the limitable total for all aircraft): (3)    Numbers of effectives: (4)    Naval expenditure -(a) in the aggregate;(b) on Naval war&quot; material.(1)    LIMITATION OF WARSHIPS is fully dealt with in the Committee&apos;s Report,  and,  in brief, the position is that the Washington and London Naval Treaties represent the only sure ground on which to stand, and should be retained intact.(2)    AIRCRAFT OF THE FLEET AIR ARM.    The Fleet Air Arm, wherever stationed,  is a unit separate from the aeroplanes of the land and air armed forces, and it is strategically unsound to consider any part as available to replace them. This distinction no doubt underlies the Table annexed to Article 36 of the Draft Convention, where aeroplanes are shown in three categories, viz. metropolitan,  overseas and ship-borne.* This/* (Actually the Table reads &quot;Aeroplanes in Aircraft Carriers&quot;, but this will require to be amended).
152This makes imperative the separate consideration of the limitation of Naval aircraft and it is essential that this coiratry&apos;s ?l&apos;imitation figure for all aircaaft should include full provision for the Naval strategical and tactical requirements assessed by the Admiralty on the basis of the Washington and London Naval Treaty limitations for ships.The proposals of the Admiralty with a view to the prevention of competition in ship-home aircraft are contained in the Paper circulated to the Committee (C.DoC (31) 23) - Appendix I.      Briefly, they reject the idea of negotiations &quot;being undertaken on the aircraft carrying capacity of the Fleets at this Conference, as this would imply revision of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and, moreover, very divergent views exist between the nations on this subject.      The Admiralty&apos;8 suggestion is that negotiations should be opened with the United States for the numerical limitation of the aircraft to be carried in the two Fleets,      Subject to parity with the United States and the 5 : 3 ratio with Japan, the A-Oiairalty would be willing to accept a limitation figure of not less than 400 Naval aircraft, which represents our own minimum requirements on the basis of the treaty fleet and is in fact 175 ail-craft below the fully carrying capacity .(3)    E?gECq?IVES*    The Admiralty have put forward in the Paper circulated to the Committee (CoD.C0(31) 35) - Appendix II, a limitation figure for total effectives of 115,400. The basis of this figure, is, briefly, that we should be enabled to man fully with active service personnel the fleet to which we are entitled -under the treaty    Provision is made in this limitation figure for personnel to man aircraft up to the total carrying capacity of the fleet and on the basis of the reduction in numbers of aircraft with the Fleet to 400,the/ .
the limitation figure for effectives can be reduced by 300 to 115,100.      It is important to note that on a 5 : S ratio with Japan, based on total tonnage, our number of effectives, calculated with reference to the actual numbers allowed for in Japanese estimates for 1931, would be over 150,000.(4)    BUDGETARY LIMITATION.      The Committee&apos;s Report recommends that no final decision should be given on this question until discussions have taken place with representatives of the Dominions, but that in any case we should not accept budgetary limitation for the Navy unless it is also accepted by other maritime nations.The Committee also state that if we do accept budgetary limitation for Naval Y/ar Material, we should insist that we should retain freedom to construct and maintain the full amount of tonnage allowed tc us under the Washington and London Naval Treaties.The Admiralty are of opinion that the only effective method of naval limitation is the direct method as in the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and that budgetary limitation superimposed on the direct method for navies is likely to be only an added complication that will achieve little.On the assumption that limitation figures may be required, the Admiralty,  in C.D.C.(51)  35 - Appendix II, have put forward a total limitation--figure of  67,000,000 -representing an average over the four years 1933 to 1936 -and a limitation figure for naval war material, on the same basis, of  38,500,000.      Both these are in excess of current expenditure, since they must enable us to -(a) build up as quickly as practicable to the limits allowed by the Treaty, should such action be necessary;
(b) equip the Fleet with full allowances of ammunition;(c) replenish reserves where,  as a matter of economy, we are at present going short.Both limitation figures would, of course, be subject to vlrement with the Dominions.I submit that the Cabinet should now authorise the Delegation to take these limitation figures under the several heads as the basis of our policy on K&quot;aval matters at the Disarmament Conference.Admiralty,  S.Wfl. 11th January, 1932,

Note by the First Lord cf the Admiralty.I circulate herewith a Memorandum by the Admiralty on the limitation of seaborne air forces for consideration of the Committee with reference t(? the Paper by the Chief of the Air Staff circulated by the late Secretary of State for Air as C.P. 259(31) and reprinted for consideration by the Committee as Annexure &quot;E&quot; to C. D.C. (3l)-10.A-,ralty, S.^L December,  1931.
15STHE LIMITATION OF SEA BORME AIR FORGES .The Admiralty have, given careful consideration to the paper by the Chief of the Air Staff on the limitation of sea borne air forces and the covering memo ran dura by the Secretary of State for Air, CP.259/31.     So long as limitations are imposed on surface ships the Admiralty are willing to accept the principle of limiting sea borne aircraft, subject to certain important reservations.Seci borne aircraft fall naturally into three categories.(a) Flying boats,(b) Carrier borne aircraft, (-c)  Ship borne aircraft.(a) Flying Boats.    The Admiralty note that these craft are not mentioned in the Air Ministry memorandum, but they must not be overlooked when the general question of the limitation ef sea borne aircraft is under consideration.(b) Carrier borne aircraft. Limitation of these can be effected in the following ways -(i) By limitation of total tonnage of the carriers,(ii) By limitation of the carrying capacity of the carriers,(iii) B,y limitation of the aircraft which may be carried in time of poaefio(i) The present limitation of total tonnage of aircraft carriers is that accepted at the Washington Cos&amp;f eroace, namely 13,5,000 tons.    At the time of the London Naval- Conference the Admiralty suggested a reduction in carrier tonnage to 125,000. This figurn was subsequently reduced by H.*ii.Govei-nrnent to 100,000 a figure which would pr-abably make it impossible foot us to construct the number of vessels required to allow foV refits jind losses.    This figure of 100,000 was -put forward at the So-nf ersnce.&quot; The United States of America, however, who arts setting the &quot;aaoe in the de-velopment qf Haral air foTOses, aho wed aa fiispjsirdop even to consider it
and it is most unlikely, that fXirther negotiations now would lead to any different result.    Moreover,  the Admiralty are convinced (and they &quot;believe that the Government share  their view)  that it would he a cardinal error of policy for us to reopen at the Disarmament Conference a discussion of the terms of tho hard won Naval treaties which are already in force and which rooresont th only effective contribution to reduction of armaments yet. made. To throw these treaties into the melting pot in 19 32 would he only likely to increase  the formidable difficulties of that conference to an impossible extent.Consequently the Admiralty consider that any question of reducing carrier tonnage below the Washington Treaty figure should not only not he the subject of negotiation with the Uaited States hut should not be raised at the Disarmament Conference at all and should remain for discussion at the 1935 Naval Conference.(ii) It is difficult  go make radical alterations in the design *,f existing carriers and a limitation of their carrying caps-city between now and 1936 does not appeer hopefuls    In any case U.S. Carriers at present carry b. considerably larger number *vf aircraft than our own and any limitation that could be agreed5 would,  so far as we are concerned, be likely to be in excess of our present carrying capacity.(iii) A limitation of aircraft to be carried appears to the Admiralty to be the best method of securing economy in peace time, but it is necessary to emphasise that in common with any attempt to limit tanks and similar comparatively small weapons of land warfare^ any agreement to restrict the numbers of air-craft Carried will quickly cease to he operative after the outbreak of war, since rircrait, unliice ships, can be rapidly produced in large numbers when occasion demands.In order to meet the views of the Air Ministry so far as possible the Admiralty would be prepared to reduce (on a
Mc.Kenna -t. *y cjbasis of parity with the U.S.a.) the number of aircraft carried in peace below full carrying capacity to the lowest point compatible with our absolute requirements.As the result of a careful review of these absolute requirements the Admiralty would be prepared to a accept the following number of carrier-borne aircraft until 1936.S/R      (Reconnaissance 100(Spotter 6T/B      (Torpedo bomber) 72Fighter 72Total 250(c)    Ship borne Aircraft,      Turning sow to the aircraft carried in ships other than carriers until 1936,Cruisers.      Clearly require aircraft for reconnaissance to extend their range of vision but it appears that a limiting figure of 2 of these aircraft for each cruiser could be accepted.Capital Shj-os. Require spotters and/or possible  tighter Reconnaissance aircraft and here again a limiting figure of 2 aircraft for each battleship could be accepted.The total ninimum number of aircraft required may thenbe estimated as followsi-rIn 15 Capital Ships........, 30In 50 Cruisers........ 100In Carriers................. 250Margin for Submarines, Sloops and other Auxiliary Services,.      25405Should the Government desire as a matter of policy to raise the question at the Disarmament Conference, the Admiralty would therefore be prepared to recommend that we should negotiate for a reduction of sea borne aircraft to 400, subject always to
the principle of parity with the United States and t&amp; -the    ^&apos; 5 :  3 ratio with Japan.      But they think it right to point    -out that as it is the United States which is forcing the pace in these matters, the effect of such negotiations may Be to impose a higher limit than we desire with the knowledge that the United States will build up to that limit in the shortest possible time.The Chief of the Air Staff in his memorandum remarks that,it would be impracticable to fix the limiting figures for our air forces upon two independent standards of parity with France and the United States at the same time.        The Admiralty appreciate this difficulty which appears to have arisen from the fixing of a single  quota for all aircraft  in Article 25 of the draft Disarmament Convention.      But as the Chief of the Air Staff points out, the considerations which govern the size of the Fleet Air Arm are entirely different from those with which the Ail- Ministry  is concerned. The problem of home defence,and in particular the defence of London, can only arise in the case of war with one or possibly two continental powers, while any limitation of sea borne aircraft has to be considered in relation to wars which may arise in any part of the world. The Admiralty are not without hopethat other countries may have similar difficulties and that it may be found possible at the Disarmament  Conference to treat these two separate problems by themselves, notwith-stending the single quota provision in the draft Convention.itehall Gardens, S.*4.1. , &quot;h December,  1931.
OCUMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS IfclTAlTCflC l&apos;[AJ:KSTY:&apos;S GOVERNMENTRET(51)   35,c A b I dtcabinet ^committee on eli^rat ioj73jtor the disarmament ^npsbescs.Memorandum by the Admiralty M&apos;n the px-jr^aed figures of limitation for personnel and expenditure.GENERAL CONST DBRATI PITS.Many of the general consideration? mentioned by the Army Council in their memorandum C.D..C, (31)  12 apply eaually to the Navy.        The great reductions already made caving to a desire to show reduced expenditure cn armaments, to financial stringency hr to the operation of the 10 year peace rule, have brought naval expenditure far below any figure at which we&apos; can afford to stabilise.The Army Council compare 1925 with 1951..      Net naval expend-iture in 1925 was  60 millions;    the estimate for 1931 is  53.-6 millions; notwithstanding that Appropriatiens-in-Aid have fallen from  3.5 millions in 1925 to  3 millions in 1931.     A truer indication of the reduction in the standing maintenance charges for the Navy is obtained by ignoring non-effective votes, fleet air arm and Appropriatiohs-in-Aid,   (the bulk of which do not figure in the Geneva Naval Budget) and also by ignoring New Construction; to which special considerations apply.    The resulting comparison for maintenance is  46.6 millions in 1925 against  39.1 millions estimated for 1931.The total of Naval personnel has fallen from 100,284 in 1925 to 91,840 which is the figure expected to he reached at the end of March next.But apart from /these-general&quot;considerations which arc mentioned by the Army Council,, there are certain special.-considerations governing the limitation of Naval effectives)
and &quot;budgets which have been set out elsewhere but are repeated here since they form the basis of the calculations which have been made to obtain the limitation figures.The Admiralty have always taken the view that the only really effective method of Naval limitation is the limitation of size and tonnage as in the Washington and London Naval Treaties.    rvhile the Admiralty are In favour of -publicity as affording a check on a country&apos;s expenditure on armaments,  in their view budgetary limitation and limitation of effectives should only be accepted in respect of our Naval forces if related directly to the numerical limitations imposed by Treaty.    The Admiralty have further stated their opinion that although this country is maintaining at present the strength of its Naval forces considerably below that allowed by the Naval Treaties,  such action should not be interpreted in any way as abrogating the right to construct up to the full Treaty limits.It follows that any limitation figure accepted for our Naval forces would have to be computed on the. basis of enabling us -(a) to build up as quickly as practicable to the limits allowed by treaty should such action be necessary..(b) to man fully the  ships as they are built as well as existing ships.-(c) to equip the ships with full allowances of ammunition.(d) to retain full liberty adequately to replace reserves of materials   stores and fuels  or to develop auxiliary services even if,  as a matter of economy, such action is not being taken at present.(e) to complete the Singapore base at any time it may be so desired.
SPECIAL AS SUMP TIpjfS,In calculating this limitation figure the Admiralty have assumed that on the principle mentioned above the limitation figures will he related to the existing Naval treaties,   these of Washington and London,  and that no action to inorease the Naval forces has been taken as permitted by Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty (the &quot;escalator&quot; clause). If the Er&amp;nco Italian discussions do not res\ilt in an agreement satisfactory to us,  or if there are any appreciable increases in the navies of other powers,  and Article 21 has to be invoked,  the figures will need revision.The Treaties prescribe limits for the Naval forces of the British Commonwealth of Nations as a whole.,      The arbitrary assumptions which the Admiralty have made as to the ships to be built and maintained by members of the Commonwealth will need thj approval of the Dominiens prior to the Conference.      Gne of these assumptions is that Australia will build a LI1ANDEK class oruisor in replacement of h.MRCA. S.BRISBANE,      If this is not dene  and provision for this  cruisor is net made by Australia,  it will be necessary for out limitation figure to be increased accordingly.The Admiralty have assumed that the Naval clauses (Of the Disarmament Convention will remain in force,  like the Washington and London Naval Treaties,  till 31st December 195-:&apos;. They have also had to assume a date for the commencement of the Convention; this has been arbitrarily taken as 1st January 1933.      They have also assumed,  in accordance with recommendation XXXV&apos; of the Cadcgan Committee,  CD. C.   (3l)l0, that budgetary limitation, if adopteds should apply to the average naval expenditure during tho period of the convention up to the 31st December 1936 instead of four-yearly periods proposed by the Budgetary Experts.Since the financial year in this country is
iiiJfrom 1st April to 31st *,iarch, Budgetary limitation has heen assumed to he from 1st April 1933 to 31st March 1937.Finally, for the purpose of calculating personnel requirements the Admiralty have assumed,  again quite arbitrarily,  that the fleet remains stable after 31st December,  1936.PERSONNEL.Table VI annexed to Chapter A of part I.  of the Draft Convention provides for the limitation of total effectives (officers, petty officers and men) in the sea armed forces.      (Table VII deals with sea formations organised on a military basis, but as there are no such formations this Table need not be further considered).As already stated,  the Admiralty&apos;s view is that the most satisfactory method of limiting Naval forces is bylimiting tonnage, but the limitation of personnel was*introduced and accepted by the Preparatory Commission in order to allay the apprehension felt in some conscript countries that a surplus of Naval effectives might be worked up for use as soldiers.It has been generally accepted at Geneva during ths discussions of the Preparatory Disarmament Commissioxi that the limitation of Naval personnel does not affect the lawful claim of a country to maintain in commission a fleet adequate to guarantee its security.The Admiralty concur in this  vi^w and have assumed that the limitation of personnel will be related to the limitation of tonnage in such a way as to admit of manning fully the whole fleet allowed by the Convention and such exempt vessels as we intend to maintain.      Whatever may be the maximum personnel required to be borne during any year during which the Convention is in force in order that the whole fleet may be fully manned will thus form the limitation figure. It is recognised that when our figure is calculated in this111S
Iway there will he a considerable margin between the limitation and publicity figures but it would clearly be out of the question to impose a handicap wn a country by means of a personnel figure which did not allow the fleet to be fully manned,   just because that country as a means of economy was not keeping its number up to the maximum in peace.    In fact the paradoxical position arises that the better prepared a country&apos;s Navy is for war in respect of personnel,   the smaller will be the margin between the &quot;Publicity&quot; and &quot;Limitation&quot; figures for effectives which that country can accept.The discrepancy need not,  and usually does not, exist in such an acute form in conscript navies,  since in their case the expense entailed by making provision for fully manning their fleets is much less than in these countries which adopt the voluntary system.Fwr example,   the Japanese estimates for 19:51 allow- for a total number of Naval effectives cf 90,700,  which figure is based on the requirements to man their whole fleet. If a comparison is made between the total tonnage of the British and Japanese Fleets,  a figure for us comparable tm the above far exceeds our present numbers.    The 5  ; 3 ratio would give us over 150,000.In calculating the United Kingdom figures the Admiralty dssuse full crews for all sea-going ships of the peace fleet,  including ships in reserve, with the necessary margins for leave,  sickness,  crossing reliefs, etc.    They provide for any necessary increase in harbour establishments due to higher numbers under- authorised scales, e.gu Instructor cooks,  etc:    They provide also for the necessary increase in numbers of recruits and numbers under training.
On the above mentioned assumption,  the maximum personnel for the United Kingdom during the period of  the Convention will be 115,400 effectives, which is therefore the figure to be inserted in Table VI.(The number of Naval effectives included in the Publicity Statement for the financial year 1929-30 was 95,042.)The number of recruits included in this limitation figure is based on the arbitrary assumption that on the 31st December,  1936,  the fleet becomes stable and that the personnel remains unaltered in the years immediately following.The inclusion in the limitation figures of any provision&apos; in respect of reservists is dependent upon the method upon which figures are calculated.    Pull provision being taken for the manning of the whole- fleet and Naval establishments with whole time effectives,   the reservists intended for these duties will,  having regard to the method laid down in the Draft Contention for reckoning the number of effectives,  be more than amply covered,   and it seems unnecessary in calculating the United Kingdom figure,  to make specific provision for any reservists.It has been assumed that there will be 575 Aircraft with the fleet,  that their pilots  (Naval and R.A.F.) will be allowed for in Air Force limitation figures but that observers and naval ratings as allowed by scale are to be included in the naval personnel figures.    If the Aircraft are reduced to 400 as proposed in C.D.C.(5l) 25, the limitation figure can be reduced by 500 to 115, 100.The fleet as limited by Treaty comprises the Navies of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. While the Admiralty/
1 fifij- v* jhave necessarily had to make  certain assumptions as to what part of that fleet will he manned by United Kingdom personnel no final decision can he taken except in consulta-tion with the Dominions.LIMITATION OF sx^TOlgflgg.Provisions of the draft convention dealing with Budgetary Limitation.The Draft Convention prescribes:(a) Limitation of total annual expenditure on Armed forces &apos;&apos;Article 29).(b) Limitation of expenditure on war material for Naval armaments (Article 24).(c) Publication of figures annually ir. a Model statement to show that the limits under (a) and (b) have notleer, exceeded (Articles 33 and 38).Separate limitation and -yirementoThe Admiralty agree with the views of the Army Council as eez forth in para.  18 of G. P. (31) 12 and have based their figures on the assumption that there will be no virement between the expenditure of the three services.    The Admiralty assume however that transfer1 *?f expenditure on Naval forces and war material will be permitted &quot;between members of  the British Commonwealth of Nations.Model Statement already furnished to the League.-.0ur total expenditure on ^he Navy and on war material for Naval Armaments,  calculated ss far as passible in accordance with the instructions proposed by the Committee of Budgetary Experts is for the financial year 1929-30 as follows:-(a) Total Expenditure *  49.9 millions.(b) War Material  23.4 millions.

Rates and Prices.The rates of naval and civil pay and prices are those expected to rule in 1932.      No provision for further fluctuation in currency has been made. PaZ.On the other hand,  allowance has been made for the lower rates of pay which reduces the limitation figure by net less that  1,000,000. Conclusion (a) Total estimates ,The total estimates compiled on the foregoing basis for the four years 1933 to 1936 are as follows  (in units of one million pounds):-1935        1934        1935        1935 57.5        65.5        75. 3        59.0 The average of these four figures is 67.0 million, and this therefore,  in accordance with recommendation XXXV of paper C.D.C.(31)10, becomes the limitation figure for total expenditure.      It compares with expenditure in 192? of  49.9 million,  an estimated expenditure for 193G of .S46.0 million, for 1931 of  45.8 million and for 1932 of  42,6 million.(b) Head IV.      Naval war material.Tho figures for war material (&apos;Head IV) for- 10 -
1933 to 1936 are as follows (in unit-sr--of&quot; one milla.oir pounds) :-1933 1934 1935 -   193628.5 37.6 46.3 41.4The average of these is 38.5 million, which is therefore the limitation figure for naval war material.This compares with expenditure in 1929 of  23.4 million and estimated expenditure for 1930 of  21.2 million, for 1931 of  19.1 million and for 1932 of 20.-3 million.      (This last figure of  20.5 million for 1932 may-he reduced &quot;by anything up to  1.3 million when the estimates for 1932 are finally settled).The wide difference between the figures for the&quot;&apos;four years shows how ^impossible it would be to adopt the Budgetary Experts&apos; proposal that expenditure in any one year should not differ from the average by more than a small fixed percentage.
