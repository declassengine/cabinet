Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I oirculate, for the information of my colleagues, a statement which I have received from a Committee representative of the heavy steel industry.    The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers, in forwarding the memorandum, said that it was signed by all the members of the Committee;    that the Committee represented 71 per cent, of the total production of the country in their own personsj    and that the views expressed may be taken as representing the whole of the heavy steel Industry. Though the memorandum was addressed to me, I understand that it was the hope of the Committee that it might be brought to the notioe of the Cabinet.W.R.d of Trade,:5rd January, 1932.
NATIONAL   FEDERATION    OF    IRON   AND   STEEL MANUFACTURERS.MEMORANDUM on thePRESENT    POSITION    OF   THE    IRON   AND   STEEL    INDUSTRY.Submitted to:The Rt.Hon. Walter Runciman, M.P. President of the Board of Trade.
CONFIDENTIAL.N.F.I.S.M11-1-32.THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE IRON &amp; STEEL INDUSTRY.1.   GENERAL.     The present position of the iron and steelindustry is so serious that the possibility of maintaining it under present conditions is definitely in question.    It is therefore essential that H.M. Government should be made aware of the seriousness of the present position:    the factors contributing to it:    the possibilities of recovery: and the conditions precedent to such recovery.There have been four major enquiries into the iron and steel industry all of which recognised the difficulties of the industry,  its necessity to the national life, national defence and its dangerous condition:    they were:(i) Departmental Committee of the Board of Trade &quot;The Ironand Steel Industries After the War&quot; in 1917. Cd.9071.(ii) &quot;Balfour&quot; Committee on Ind\istry and Trade, &quot;Volume Y.containing 126 Pages, Vols.1, 11 &amp; 111 contained 25 pages.(iii) Civil Research Committee of the Cabinet July toDecember 1925.(iv) Civil Research Committee of the Cabinet July 1929to May 1930.2.    SCALE OF THE INDUSTRY.      Estimated productive capacity:pig iron 12 million tons per annum:    steel 12 to 14 million ingot tons per annum.3.    EMPLOYMENT CAPACITY AT FULL OPERATION.      Direct to rolled products 300,000:    indirect ancillary trades,  coal, ore, limestone, mining and transport not less than 200,000, making a total of 500,000 men.4.    DECLINE.    As measured by production,  imports and exports in recent years.

Steel production in 1931 is 68 per cent of the output in 1913 and 63 per cent of the out-put in 1924.In 1913 Exports exceeded imports by 238,000 tons per month, but since September 1930 Imports have exceeded Exports each month and in the last three months by no less than 127,200 tons per month and in November as a result of &quot;forestalling&quot; by no less than 184,000 tons or the amount of the average monthly imports for 1913.Whereas in 1913 338 blast furnaces were operating, 70 only are operating today;    of Wrought Iron works 94 were manufacturing in 1913 only 33 are operating today; of steel works 88 were in operation in 1913 and only 45 today.
Unemployment is 42.9 per cent of those registered as employed in the industry;    whereas the national percentage is 21.4Finance.   The great majority of the concerns in the industry have not only paid no ordinary dividend for ten years, but have not earned ordinary depreciation, as a con-sequence interest on prior charges has in effect to a large extent been paid out of capital. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO DECLINE.(i) Free Import Market. Great Britain being a free market permits competition from low wage countries and the dumping of surplus production below the cost of pro-duct ion in the country of origin:    also competition subsidised by various methods such as special rail-way rates for export trade.(ii) Much heavier taxation and social service charges in the united Kingdom than abroad.    Cost of Social Ser-vices 200 per cent higher than in 1913.(iii) Higher Capital Charges.     All competing countries have rehabilitated their industry out of war eompen-sation or national funds and have liquidated their pre-war fixed capital debts by inflation.    In the United Kingdom the interest on Fixed capital amounts to not less than 15/- per ton at present rate of pro-duction whereas if working at full capacity fixed interest charges would be in the neighbourhood of 6/6 per ton, showing the influence of volume of pro-duction on the incidence of fixed charges, (iv) Wages.    The ratio of average wages on a gold basis in the iron and steel industry of the United Kingdom and those of Continental countries is represented by the following:    United Kingdom 100;    Germany 59; France 47;    Luxemburg 44;    Belgium 40.      Continental wages have declined further since these ratios were calculated.
O W ix*(v) Burden of Railway Charges and sheltered industries generally.      Railway rates are still of the order of 55 per cent above pre-war and represent BO per cent of the realised prices for the products of the industry whereas the selling prices of those products are only 4 per cent above pre-war.    The sheltered industry element in manufacturing costs is generally of the order of 60 to 70 per cent higher than pre-war.(vi) The premature return to the gold standard in 1925, and the revaluation of the   at pre-war parity, has been one of the most important factors contributing to the decline of British industry, since it was quite impossible to reduce wages proportionate to the in-creased purchasing value of the  , and as a consequence, exports were handicapped by approximately 10 per cent reduction in price while maintaining the same costs, and imports were in effect subsidised by 10 per cent. This return was made in spite of the warnings of industry that the results must prove disastrous to industry and consequently increase unemployment.This followed the violent stimulation to the competi-tive power of France, Germany, Belgium and Czecho-Slovakia, by their adoption of the reverse policy in an extreme form.    The effect of our departure from the gold standard in September is not yet evident. As a result of these various factors the present dis-parity in cost levels between this country and the Continent is so so great that it is definitely impossible for any superior efficiency of British industry ever to meet   -6.    MEASURES TAKEN BY THE INDUSTRY TO MEET THE SITUATION.A large number of measures of a corporate nature have been taken which may be briefly summarised.
Amalgamation.     Important groups have been amalgamated in Scotland, North East Coast, Lancashire, Sheffield and South Wales,  the five regions which successive enquiries have visualised as being suitable areas for amalgamation.    Further reorganisation on these lines requires, however, additional capital and a measure of confidence in the future of the industry which under present conditions is entirely lacking. Co-operative Action.(a) Through Trade Associations.    These have for their general object the stabilisation of prices in the interests of both producers and consumers.    Recently co-operation with consumers to a greater degree through the granting of rebates and special financial assistance in developing export markets under present conditions has been arranged.    The method may be described as the pooling of competitive power of the producing and using industries in their common interest.    These special arrangements apply to the shipbuilding industry and the structural engineering industry, while negotiations are in progress for the development of a similar degree of co-operation with the Re-rolling industry which is mainly responsible for the imports of semi-finished material.(b) The British Steel Export Association.    A Selling Company designed to develop the export trade which is making progress particularly in the Canadian market, where it has established permanent representation.    It is receiving the cordial support of the Canadian Govern-ment, of important Canadian consumers and is developing co-operation with Canadian producers.    This Association
3 Q /Io o&apos; ^flwMwmiitawliiiiWfWiiMi ilk        --Tffli iftiHii*aiiiiii tflifciwiii^irnintrn to i I also sent a mission to the South American markets and is developing the Export trade through London in various other export markets of the world.     It is proposing to extend its operation by foreign missions still further.(c) British Steelwork Association.     An Association of steel makers and steel users (Structural Engineers) which is in effect a market research association for the development of the use of structural steel.   Apart from propaganda the Association has prepared designs for bridges for local authorities all over the Kingdom, in the furtherance of the adoption of steel rather than other structural materials for bridge work.In connection with this Association the Building Research Council has been formed in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for the development of the use of steel for building purposes and the amendment of the existing building regulations (which are based on the practice and standards of 40 years ago ) in order to facilitate the extension of the use of steel under regulations based on modern knowledge and technique.(d) British Steel Mark. -With a view to popularising British steel and bringing its advantages before the public the Feder-ation has registered a National Mark, the signifi-cance of which in quality, employment value, and economy in service is emphasised in the propaganda
9 a k*j J Ji .in...iiMiH n.....iiltMUMmMMUnlMHirfliHiiMmof the British Steelwork Association.      The British Steel Mark has been already adopted by firms respon-sible for 70 per cent of the ingot steel output of the country and is used by practically all steel mak-ers engaged in the production of structural steel, (e)    The Iron and Steel Industrial Research Council. This has developed from an organisation formed in 1925 for securing fuel economy in the industry on the general principles of the German Warmestelle, and is responsible for promoting research into the whole of the industrial processes of the industry, with a view to the improvement of productive efficiency and reducing costs.This Council works in conjunction with the De-partment of Scientific and Industrial Research from whom it receives a grant.A feature of the 21 Sectional Committees work-ing under this Council is that they are constituted mainly from those responsible for the practical opera-tion of the industry, supplemented where necessary by leading scientists in the particular field of scientific work concerned.The work of the Research Council receives Inter-national recognition, and the Technical Department of the National Federation maintains, through an inter-change of visits with America and the Continent, the closest contact with the development of productive technique throughout the world as it is in continual correspondence with every similar organisation and cognate scientific society, and with whom exchange of information is also established on a systematic basis.
(f)   Heavy Steel Industry Committee.     This consists of representatives of five districts, Scotland, North East Coast, Lancashire, Sheffield and South Wales, which meets to consider the productive and commercial policy of the heavy steel industry in its broadest sense.   This Committee is responsible for the general policy affect-ing co-operation with using industries and the ultimate policy of co-ordinating expansion,  if conditions can be created within which additional capital expenditure in the industry can be justified.By far the largest proportion of the output of iron and steel is controlled by companies which are vertical combinations controlling the major portion of their raw materials, ore,  coal, coke and limestone right through to the finished product. EFFICIENCY OF THE INDUSTRY.The general charges of inefficiency of the industry have been made by those unconnected with it, and without technical knowledge as a superficial explanation of the depression without relating that depression to the real causes of political, financial and economic origin out-side the control of the industry itself.Generally it may be claimed that under the condi-tions that have obtained in the past ten years the eff-iciency of the British iron and steel industry is high and its productive plant is in such a condition that it can be readily brought up to the highest standard of efficiency when sufficient confidence is restored to warrant additional capital expenditure.      It is accept-ed by those foreign competitors who have visited them that there are British works unsurpassed if not
9O 0 bunequalled in the general efficiency of their plant and productive methods.      It is not easy to demonstrate the efficiency of the industry in a non-technical Memorandum tut it is at least significant that the most acute eompe-tition with which the industry is faced comes not from America and Germany which are regarded by critics as being the most efficient but from the low wage countries of Belgium and Luxemburg.      In 1930,  for instance, according to the Board of Trade returns 64.1 per cent of the imports came from Belgium and Luxemburg,  only 14.1 per cent from Germany and 0.5 per cent from the United States.It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the industry is a highly technical one and it cannot be re-organised effectively from outside by those having no knowledge of either its technical processes or its economic structure. 8.    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO RECOVERY.In this the most highly industrialised country in the world national policy must obviously be concentrated on the restoration of prosperity to industry and the increase of employment, and this should be the main consideration in domestic and foreign policy, as the only method of res-toring to this country world leadership.(a)    In order that the industry may operate under the most efficient conditions and so secure the lowest possible costs the maximum volume of production which the markets open to the industry permit must be obtained.This requires at least equality of opportunity with competitors in the home market.     Present competition from the Continent is based not on superior efficiency but on their being able to sell a proportion of their output at less than the costs of production.     The three million tons of imports which this country is now importing
annually represent less than 10 per cent, of the productive capacity of the Continent.     The Continental makers even under normal conditions find it profitable to dispose of this percentage in Great Britain at prices less than their home prices.     At times like the present competition for orders in Britainrs free market involves Continental makers in a substantial loss.     For instance, the Bergwerks Zeitung of November 29th last states that the sale of semi-finished material,  joists and railway material is taking place at from 50 to 70 Marks below the cost of production, French Iron and Steel Makers corroborated this in the past few weeks by stating they were selling for export at 40 per cent below their cost of production.      Conditions such as these have forced the British works into a competition which has in-volved the dissipation of capital which can only mean in the long run the ruin of British industry.     As has already been pointed out British industry is supporting a large propor-tion of the capital expended to meet national needs during the war while other competing countries have not only written off war capital but either by war compensation or inflation have written off the whole of their pre-war fixed capital indebtedness.      Competing countries have, therefore, highly equipped, expanded and modernised iron and steel industries without a proportionate additional capital in-debtedness.(h)   A revision of our Fiscal system which will make it possible for British industry to negotiate with their inter-national competitors an agreement for the regulation of the iron and steel trade of the world having for its object the raising of world prices at least to such a level as will en-sure a legitimate profit above the cost of production while at the same time leaving a margin for the free play of competitive efficiency.
hj t-.J t.y(c)    A reduction in railway rates so as to make them more commensurate with the wholesale price index and to ensure that they do not impose a burden on the industries dis-proportionate to the services rendered.There are other factors of more general application, but which are of particular interest to the iron and steel industry such as a reduction of taxation:    the better dis-trihution of the wage fund, with a view to a greater approach to equalisation between the wage level in sheltered and unsheltered industries:    the stabilisation of the   in due time at such a level in relation to foreign currencies as will permanently remove the handicap which the return to the gold standard in 1925 occasioned to British industry from that date to September last.    The relief of industrial reserves from income tax until distributed as dividends or bonus shares as soon as national finance permits in order to encourage the modernisation and expansion of equipment out of revenue so as to improve British competitive power and employment capacity.9.   THE Future of THE INDUSTRY.(i)     If existing conditions are allowed to persist, the result to the industry must prove disastrous, and involve a large proportion if not the whole of it in collapse, which will render rebuilding exceedingly difficult if not impossible and certainly delay its recovery for many years even with a protected home market.The industry has exhausted not only its own liquid resources but its box-rowing powers in the past ten years, during which it has been exposed to the competition from industries subsidised in the manner already described. It cannot be too clearly or definitely stated that the
industry is not responsible for the results of the failure to provide conditions within which it is able to secure its own recovery.    The conditions which have caused its decline have been imposed upon it from without as a result of thet post-war policy pursued by successive Governments.Under existing conditions, no iron and steel productive plant in this country designed in the light of the latest scientific and industrial experience could meet the present competition experienced    in this market and pay any return on the capital involved, or even earn adequate provision for depreciation.    But given moderate protection in the home market,  combined with protection against &quot;dumping&quot; it is believed that even with the present low volume of demand represented by production, plus the very large volume of imports (a large proportion of which should become available to British works in the event of a protective policy being adopted) that       &quot;&apos;  -expenditure of additional capital would be justified.(ii)      Organisation.      Every Committee of Enquiry has indicated, as indeed was natural, under post-war conditions, and having regard to the large scale organisations in foreign countries,  that regional organisation of the industry on the basis of amalgamation of iron and steel companies in the five principal producing centres was desirable.The amalgamation of firms producing the same products has been the progressive policy of the industry and a very considerable measure of amalgamation has already taken place.    It may be said that in Scotland, North East Coast, Lancashire, Sheffield and South Wales,rTTi&apos;i rTrrflniimm..........ifriillllUMl^lllflnniiiiMiillflil......mmjtmlmmiwmwtlittwflllm inn.....inRMBMJMIIIIIWlimnianM igTiitlli- m m i......miiiipmanmiiiiiiN................-&quot;Trriii^nffn hi-w^-WMIHmit
1 \j xmore than half of the productive capacity of heavy steel in each of these districts is embodied in one financially amalgamated group, and of the balance it may be said -as regards steel production - all the producers are working in close association to ensure a national policy being followed.(iii) International Policy. If Great Britain were given control of her home market international agreements wouldbe facilitated.i! Continental countries are anxious that the British industry should participate in international arrangements and many of them have expressed the view that until the British market is protected no effective stable internation-al Cartel is possible.    They admit they are dumping their surplus production in competition with each other at even 40 per cent below their own costs of production, and they would rather have a regulated market on which they could base their own immediate and future policies than the uncertainty which obtains at present.    The destruction of confidence which a falling price level has engendered has caused a restriction of capital enterprise to a level below what is potentially possible.The International Steel Cartel was formed in September 1926 and in December of that year representatives of the British industry met a Committee of the Cartel to consider participation, but since a quota of only 8 million tons per annum was conceded to Britain by Continental countriesiowing to our free market the British industry had no basis for negotiating a higher quota:    the offer was declined with the full understanding of the difficulties of the British industry, on the part of the Continental countries
who made it.This decision was justified by subsequent events as the production of 1929 in this country was 9.6 million tons.(iv) Imperial Policy.    In the Dominions, where British industry has a preference, and where iron and steel indus-tries have been established as a result of the inability of this country to supply their needs during the war period, negotiations have been begun with India, Canada, Australia, and an invitation extended to South Africa, with a view to the British and Dominion industries concerned co-operating with Dominion industries in the development of their own markets.    The constitution of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers has been changed recently to permit of membership of that Federation by Dominion industries.    Representative industries in India and Australia have already become members:    others have it under considera-tion as soon as economic conditions improve.The basis of co-operation is agreement as to what products are in sufficient demand to be efficiently produced in the Dominions in question, leaving the others to be supplied by Britain under preferential duties as against the rest of the world.(v) Central Selling.      The British Steel Export Association forms the basis of a comprehensive selling organisation for the development of overseas markets, which would be expanded to ensure effective technical representation in all con-suming markets.    This is obviously dependent on confidence in the future, on which to base a permanent organisationof this character, involving the selection and appointment of suitable technical personnel and the capital commitment involved in the maintenance of further organisations overseas.
%There is no doubt that the adoption of these several measures and others which profit earning would render possible, would result in an increase in competitive power, and an expansion of markets, not only through the develop-ment of consumption in the more backward consuming markets as a result of a more aggressive commercial policy, but in the development of new uses for products of the industry.10. PROTECTION - DISADVANTAGES AND ADVANTAGES.DISADVANTAGES: (i) It is claimed that the products of the industrybeing the raw material of finishing industries, that protection depriving these industries of the cheap xm-ports, would react unfavourably to their competitive power in export markets.This is accepted as an axiom without a critical examination of its full implications, such as the pro-portion of the cost of the raw material to the total finished product, etc.Machinery exports for example are valued at  100 per ton in the Board of Trade returns;    the amount of iron and steel they contain represents some 10 per cent of their value.     The British Engineersr Association re-presenting the heavy engineering industries support pro-tection for the iron and steel industry.In the sheet and tinplate industries, in which it is claimed by a small section that cheap foreign steel is necessary for their export trade, 85 per cent of the out-put in 1929 was made from British steel but today the pro-portion is decreasing owing to the competition of the small proportion of makers using Foreign steel.
These industries control 70 per cent of the world export trade even under present conditions owing to the supremacy of British manufacturing technique.The British motor car industry desires to be wholly dependent on British steel;   while the Electrical industry also strongly supports the application of the steel industry for a tariff.Thus some of the principal using industries, realising-that their dependence on foreign sources of supply would, he fatal to their continued existence, support   protection of the iron and steel industry.The thesis that protection will result in higher prices than are obtainable from the Continent, is undoubtedly true under existing conditions, but the policy of free imports carries with it implications that are far more dangerous to the using industries than the possibility of an increase in price which has such a small influence on their ultimate competitive power, since they threaten their continued existence in this country.(ii)    The possibility that the British iron and steel industry may when relieved of competition from foreign countries, ex-ploit the position to its own profit and to the disadvantage of using industries by artificially raising prices.Apart from the fact that such a policy would operate to the detriment of the industry by decreasing the oonsurap-tion of steel, which it is the object of the industry to in-orease,  it is the considered policy of the industry to make every effort to maintain the existing British price level, and to secure its own re-habilitation from reduced costs which will result from an increasing volume of production.
A ft 5j  u jThe price level according to the Board of Trade index has for the past four years been but little above pre-war and it is the definite policy of the industry to continue to reduce prices in the interests of increased competitive power and volume of demand.(iii)    Inefficiency.     That protection may result in a slackening in the rate of progressive development and competitive efficiency.Apart from the fact that this would be detrimental to the best interests of those who are mainly concerned with the prosperity of the industry those responsible for it are prepared to give an assurance that immediately the home market is effectively protected they will proceed with the carrying out of plans which they have had drawn up and continually amended to suit the changing conditions of the past ten years which involve substantial prospective expenditure, provided capital is obtainable.At the same time if profit earning conditions can be created, as the industry believes, the expenditure of the industry on research will be progressively increased.The industry recognises that protection may deprive a small section of industry of the possibility of consider-able profits made under present conditions of free imports, and that those affected will feel they have cause for protest.But it is submitted that such profit is at the expense of national income and even in large part a charge on the National Exchequer, from the unemployment which results.ADVANTAGES.(i)    The collapse of the industry would be prevented and a foundation established for its progressive development from within.
(ii) By providing an increased volume of production to the industry protection will enable it to reduce its costs and increase its competitive power at home and abroad, and ultimately to provide a sound foundation for British manufacturing industry generally, which will otherwise be involved in the event of the collapse of the iron and steel industry.     Conversely a reduction in our imports will increase the costs of continental competition. Dependence on foreign sources of supply of iron and steel in peace or war must reduce this country to a second class power, economically as well as diplomatically.(iii) The confidence which such security would engender not only in the iron and steel and ancillary industries but on those dependent upon it, would result in a general for-ward policy and the creation of an entirely new morale in British industry.(iv) The possibility of giving effect to the forward policies which the iron and steel industry has formulated in the development of export markets both imperial and foreign.(v) The possibility of stabilising the world price level through co-operation with the International Cartel which British industry could almost certainly lead, and thus stimulate the world recovery of international trade.(vi) The progressive organisation of the industry and the expenditure of additional capital in modernising and balancing of plant would give a stimulus to the Engineering and cognate industries.(vii) The establishment of a national Committee controll-ing and directing the policy of the industry as a national unit vis-a-vis the Empire and foreign countries.The basis of these organisations already exists and has been in operation for some years.Where they are not functioning as trade organisa-tions they exist as Committees of the National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers,
(viii) The possibility o.f providing special plant.    As an example Basic Bessemer steel may be taken.    This method was pioneered in Great Britain and although abandoned for engineering purposes its elimination as semi-finished material, for which there is still a large demand, was due to unfair Continental competition.    It is possible to produce the quality at costs competitive with Continental costs but notin competition with present Continental selling prices and plans are already prepared for such development.    Under existing conditions unfair competition and dumping makes finance impossible and therefore retards a scheme which, judged on a cost of production basis,  is thoroughly economical even compared with the cheapest and best Continental steel practice,(ix) The relief of unemployment.    Every 1,000,000 tons of imports of steel deprives 40,000 men of employment for one year with the consequent charge on National funds for their unemployment dole etc.(x) The effect on the Adverse Balance of Trade would be important since the total value of imports of iron and steel, most of which could be made in this country,  for the year 1931 was over  20,000,000..(xi) The general increase in productivity and employment would enable ancillary industries and services, for example, railway companies to work at higher efficiency and thus reduce their costs and contribute to a general reductionof the price level on an economic basis.11. CONCLUSION.In conclusion it must be stated that the alternative appears to be the collapse of a substantial part of the industry to a scale at which it may be maintained for a greater or shorter period on special lines of production
in the technique of which Britain for the present holds a diminishing advantage.This will &quot;be quite insufficient for meeting national needs either in peace or war and would &quot;be on a scale from which it could not possibly be expanded in the event of a national emergency.In this country the raw materials of the industry, ore,  coal and limestone, are associated in much closer proximity than in any other country.     These natural advan-tages over competing countries have been an important factor in the birth and development of the iron&apos; ani. steel industry of this country and provide a sound foundation on which to build the future prosperity of the industry when suitable economic conditions are created.These relative advantages are less today than in the past century, due to the high cost of British Railway rates; the partial exhaustion of high grade ores in various districts, and the reduction in the cost of transport of impontei ores in countries not so favourably situated.In making this somewhat exhaustive statement of the grave position of the industry, those who have prepared it desire to state that they are discharging what they conceive to be their responsibility to the Government and the Nation, and have not exaggerated in any particular the gravity of the present crisis.     The position of the industry is so critical that immediate protection of the h*me market is an essential condition precedent to any action that the industry can itself take for its revival.A continuance of present conditions must jecpardise the future existence of the industry as a whole, and the issue nn which a decision must be made is.no less than whether it is
