H.India Office, 12th January 1932.Telegram xrom Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of Statefor India, dated 10th January 1932.Madras.Little serious Congress activity in this Presidency so far. Prohibitory orders under section 144 were passed in various places on the 4th and 5th, and meetings held in defiance of these orders were dispersed by force iu Cocanada, Cuddalore, Conjeeveram, Madura, Masulipatam, Trichinopoly and Arcot. Congress organisations generally are dissolving themselves and appointing dictators. So far 37 associations have been declared unlawful. Molestation and Boycotting aud Unlawful Association Ordinances were applied to the whole Presidency on 5th and 6th January respectively, and Unlawful Instigation Ordinance to Kistna East and West Godavari on 7th January.Bengal.General situation quiet.   Very few signs of civil disobedience at present. United Provinces.All magistrates ordered on 3rd January to stop processions and meetings on occasion of Gandhi&apos;s arrest by order under section 144 and disperse them peacefully. Except in Benares, Allahabad, Cawnpore and Lucknow, these orders were with few unimportant exceptions everywhere obeyed. In Allahabad processions were taken out on 4th and 5th January and hartal was observed. Processions were stopped by police. On first day, a large and abusive crowd assembled, which was dispersed by police, using polo sticks. Two men were knocked down when crowd fled and trampled to death ; few minor casualties occurred, 50 arrests were made. On second day, crowd was orderly, no action taken, procession dissolved at sunset. On third day, prohibition order was modified and orderly procession allowed to visit usual meeting place. On fourth and fifth days, no procession occurred at Benares. Small procession and meeting took place on 4th January and some arrests made. On 5th January hartal took place, large procession organised, Town Hall was occupied by magistrate with police. Procession not allowed to enter, crowd became violent, assaulted police with bricks. Magistrate compelled to order firing ; 14 rounds of buckshot were fired and charge made, which dispersed crowd. Two men were killed and about 50 iujured. Hartal continued on 6th January, but shops opened on 7th and situation more normal. At Lucknow, meeting place was occupied by police and attempts to take procession out frustrated for three days. Few arrests of leaders made daily at Cawnpore. Small processions taken out and meetings organised in deliance of orders almost entirely by Hindus. Situation controlled by police and few arrests being made daily up to date. Elsewhere few hartals occurred, but on whole singularly little agitation resulted. No further extension of No-rent Ordinance made, but in view of Congress decision to start civil disobedience movement throughout Province, Govern-in en t have arranged to extend Emergency Powers, Instigation and Molestation Ordinances throughout Province to-day. Except in Allahabad district, effect of Ordinance on no-rent propaganda has been satisfactory and rents being collected everywhere.   In Allahabad progress still slow.5S7    - 60   1.32
So far no reports of boycott or picketing received, but His Excellency will preside at meeting of Chambers of Commerce and business men this afternoon in Gawnporeto-assure them that Government will take necessary steps to prevent inconvenience or loss to trade resulting from Congress activities. Similar meeting being organised iu all divisional headquarters by Commissioners. Total convictions reported, 117 under Ordinance, 66 under ordinary law.Punjab.Frontier developments have not ruffled Punjab, though there is a certain anxiety for fuller information, preferably from non-official sources, which Congress circles seek to stimulate. Gandhi&apos;s arrest and subsequent action by Government of other Provinces under Ordinances have had no repercussion except to some small extent in Amritsar and. Lahore. Provincial Working Committee advised all Congress Committees to dissolve and appoint dictators. Some districts have acted accordingly, notably Amritsar, which has appointed a dictator and War Council. In Lahore policy has been changed, and Dr. Alam has publicly announced that Congress Committees have not been dissolved. Public generally remain apathetic, and picketing, though threatened in Lahore and Amritsar, has not started. Business circles report considerable increase iu foreign cloth market consequent on His Excellency&apos;s assurances to merchants. We anticipate no untoward developments in immediate future. Steps are being taken to defeat volunteering in Amritsar, and Independence Day, originally advertised for 10th, will probably,be a fiasco. Total arrests have been five in Ludhiana and three in Amritsar, all under ordinary law. Total number of associations notified, five.Burma.Everything quiet and no reactions on arrest.of Gandhi, except partial hartal on first day.   Provincial Congress Committee decided to do nothing in view of peculiar-situation in Burma.    Few minor members of Committee have resigned.    Paddy market slightly disturbed and some merchants were instructed from Bombay to ship no rice by British Indian steamers.Bihar and Orissa.Prompt action against Congress leaders, Congress offices and volunteer camps has temporarily at least disorganised movement and districts report abandonment of camps and offices and dispersal of Congress workers into Mufassil. Arrests and dispersal of unlawful meetings and processions effected without any disturbance or sympathetic demonstrations, at Patha. Congress headquarters seized on evening of 4th and Rajindra Prasad arrested with four other leaders in Hazarabagh. Provincial Congress camp seized on 6th in Orissa. Local dictator arrested in Cuttack and All-India Congress Camp at Puri reported abandoned. Tirhut and Bhagalpur divisions are quiet and no activity in Chotanagpur. No general revival of picketing, and arrests under Molestation Ordinance only reported from Cuttack, Balasore and Palainan. No developments of no-rent campaign. SearchligJit, leading Congress paper, suspended publication as result of action taken to prevent circulation. General public appears to approve decisive measures taken by Government. Not possible to anticipate future developments or effect of dispersal of workers into Mufassil areas.Assam.Apart from meetings at Sylhet and Dhubri to protest against Ordinances and arrests, and attempts in a few towns to enforce hartal on 5th January which met with success only at S3,lhet and to some extent at Dhubri, Assam has been quiet, and no other overt action has so far been taken. Newspapers report that Congress Committees in the Province are being or have been dissolved and individuals appointed as dictators.North-West Frontier Province.Peshawar district. Satisfactory on whole. Columns of police supported by troops working from various centres have been active in visiting worst villages to arrest local leaders and to show flag in areas where there are signs of disaffection. During week, troops employed twice near Mardan and once near Swabi to break up hostile demonstrations, on all occasions without recourse to firing. Attempts to picket shops in city and civil courts in Mardan, Charsadda and Novvshera have been foiled without much difficulty. Loyalists and intelligentsia still rather nervous of coming out into open on Governments side in case they are again let down by a repetition of
Delhi Pact, but their confidence is slowly increasing, and Khans and Maliks are beginning to reassert their authority. Grain prices maintain satisfactory level and revenue collection good throughout district. In Kohat, district situation has greatly improved since despatch of column to disaffected Khattak area. Arrests made there have impressed people with Governments determination, and their attitude has changed for better. Elsewhere in district, Congress agitation has practically died out. There has been a certain amount of picketing in Bannu city and district necessitating arrests, and attitude of people still rather sullen, although it is improving. In Dera Ismail Khan district Congress movement confined to Tank Tehsil and is not serious. In Henzada district Congress movement virtually dead. On the whole there has been a steady improvement throughout the Province, and general situation is very satisfactory. So far there has been practically no reaction to Gandhi&apos;s arrest or other events. Down country trans-frontier situation good,- except for Mohmand country, where certain notoriously hostile Mullahs collected a small lashkar and moved down to within 20 miles of British border. Firm attitude of assured clans-checked them, aud they started dispersing on 8th January. Rain started yesterday and continued to-day, and this, combined with beginning of Ramzan, will probably settle incident for time being. Political situation, Ajmer Merwara: -Measures taken were extension Unlawful Association and Molestation Ordinances. District Congress Committees and Ajmer Nau Javvan Bharat Sabha were declared unlawful associations. Three Congress leaders arrested at Ajmer and five at Beawar. Possession taken of five places from which Congress propaganda disseminated. No serious picketing, but hartals observed in district after Gandhi&apos;s arrest.Bombay.Operations commenced on 4th instant with arrest of Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel under Bombay Regulation. Promulgation of Ordinances was promptly followed by arrests of notorious and dangerous agitators under Emergency Powers Ordinance,, section 3. Arrests so far reported total 187 in 14 districts and Bombay city ; full information not yet received. Arrests have been received quietly by general public and little interest evinced even in the way of hartals. A few protest meetings have been organised, attendance not usually large, and speakers in many cases subsequently arrested. His Excellency&apos;s message to the public, which appeared in Press on 7th, has been widely noticed, and had good effect. Picketing on a small scale reported from several stations and being dealt with. Everything quiet generally. Five hundred and twenty-six associations in the whole Presidency have been declared unlawful under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, and 14-2 buildings notified under section 3 of Ordinance Four. A number of these buildings, including Congress House, Bombay, already seized without incident. In some cases, persons arrested under section 3^ Emergency Powers Ordinance, have voluntarily severed connection with Congress, and are being released accordingly.
