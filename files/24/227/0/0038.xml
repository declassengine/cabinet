DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).CABINET . THE JUDICIAL VACANCY.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor,.In Novemher, 1927, Lord Cave circulated to the Cabinet a memorandum CP.  278(27), proposing that an address should be moved in both Houses under the Judi-cature Act of 1925, for the appointment of two additional Judges in the Kingrs Bench Division.      The Cabinet approved the proposal and the resolutions were passed, the address-ffas presented on the 14th February 1928, and Mr. Justice Charles and Mr. Justice Humphreys were appointed according-ly on the 17th and 18th February, 1928.      This brought the15 up to 17.By the operation of the Judicature Act of 1925 the resolution thus passed had effect for twelve months and, therefore, when Mre Justice Salter died towards the end of 1928 it was not necessary to have recourse again, to Parlia-ment and on the 14th December, 1928, Mr. Justice Macnaghtep was appointed In hie place, thereby bringing the number of Puisne Judges again up to 17.In October, 1929* Mr. Justice Shearman   resigned and the vacancy so created has, from motives of economy, remained unfilled.     It vas hoped that the remaining 16 Judges would bo able to carry on the work in the Kingrs Bench Division adequately,ThiB hope has proved to be unfounded.     The figures show that the appointment of two Judges in February, 1928, effectedCRET.50(52).number of Puisne Judges of the Kingrs Bench Division from
91 fian immediate improvement in the position which was main-tained until Mr.  Justice Shearman&apos;s retirement in October1929, and that from then onwards it has heoome progressivelyworse.The improvement was shown by comparing the figures for 1927 with those for 1928o    These show that the number of actions tried by the Judges in the year rose from 1,093 to 1,203, and that the cases left over at the end of the year dropped from ly017 to 851.The improvement was nearly maintained in 1929 s although more cases were entered during the course of the year.Since then the position has been distinctly worse. The year 1931 may be taken as a fair examples    At the beginning of the year 1,160 cases had been left over frcm the year before;    2,414 were entered during the year making a total of 3,574.    Of these 1,314 were disposed of out of Court, leaving a balance of 2,260 which represents the task before the Judgeso    Of these the number actually tried was 1,071 and the number left over at the end of the year was 1,189.This rate of progress is far from satisfactory. It means that of the cases now awaiting trial some were ready for trial nearly a year ago and many ready for trial since then will not be tried within a year.    It means also that some of the cases &quot;otherwise&quot; disposed of are settled out of Court owing to the difficulty of obtaining a trial within a reasonable timeoEven this rate of progress has not been achieved without assistanceo    It has been necessary to spend  2,500 upon Commissioners of Assize.    It should be added that there has been a considerable amount of illness this year among the Judges accounting for an aggregate of 97 judicial dayso
The figures given relate only to a part of tho King&apos;s Bench Judges&apos; work, hut the figures for the other part afford no alleviation of the position.      The number of appeals from inferior courts awaiting trial by two or more Judges in London has risen from 120 at the beginning of 1928 to 154 at tho beginning of this year.,      The ordinary criminal and civil work on circuit (including divorce) remains about the same.If the vacancy is now filled, bringing the number of Puisne Judges up to 17 and the number of king Bench Judges,  including the Lord Chief Justice, up to 13;    if an average number of cases are entered during the year and an average number are disposed of out of Court;    if there is no illness among the Judges, and if a Judge gets through 70 cases in a year (which is rather above the average), not counting divisional court work or work on circuit, there will remain over at tho end of 1952 at least 1,000 cases,      1 cannot, therefore, hold out any hope that the amount spent on Commissioners of Assize will be seriously diminished by the appointment of an additional Judge, but if one were not appointed,  the amount spent on Commissioners would be seriously increased.The estimated gross cost of appointing a new Judge is as follows.      The statutory salary is  5,000 per annum. This has been reduced by the Economy Act to  4^000 per annum. The income tax on this salary, at the present rate., amounts to  l,000o      In addition surtax reduces the net salary to a figure between  2,000 and  5,000,,      To the net salary must be added the salary of the Judge&apos;s clerk, namely  400 per annum carrying Civil Service bonus.(Intld. )     S.House of Lords, S97,1.
