Copy No.CABINET.Reports by Local Governments on the Political Situation in India.MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OE STATE  FOR INDIA.I circulate for the information of my colleagues copy of telegraphic reports from, the Local Governments iu India.India Office, 26th January 1932.S. H.Bombay.Action under the Emergency Powers Ordinance continues against the leaders of the movement and is reported to be generally effective in keeping the situation quiet. There have been J 09 arrests under section 3 during the week in all districts, including Bombay cit3*, making a total of 527. Detention beyond 15 days has been sanctioned in 351 cases up to date, while the remainder are being released with orders under section 4. So far there have been 64 arrests for disobedience of such orders in nine districts and Bombay city. About 80 buildings have been seized up to date under Unlawful Associations Ordinance in whole Presidency. Generally, unlawful activities are confined to petty demonstrations and incidents, but anumber of persons were slightly injured when an obstinate procession in Dobad was dispersed with canes by the police. In Belgaum, lawbreaking is being organised on a more serious scale, and includes the cutting of toddy trees, forest offences and cutting telegraph wires. Forest offences are also reported from four villages of Kanara. The no-tax campaign has been noticed chiefly in the Belgaum district. Elsewhere, collections of land - revenue are proceeding satisfactorily where revenue is due-Ordinance 3 has already been extended to land revenue dues throughout the Presidency, excluding Sind. Picketing has been scarcely noticeable, except in Ahmedahad, Belgaum and Bombay city. Attempts to discredit currency notes in Ahmedabad city have resulted in a rush for silver at the Imperial Bank,, but the panic subsided after two days. A P&apos;arsi who was stabbed in Ahmedabad is believed to have been mistaken for a Police Inspector. Bombay city is quiet, but the cloth markets remained closed for most of the week. The Bullion Exchange closed for two days. The number of picketers, male and female, is about 120 daily, with special concentration at the Mint and Bullion Exchange. Arrests are being made daily. A meeting of protest organised by Commercial Associations against the Ordinances and arrests of leaders, advertised for 21st instant, did not take place owing to a warning by the Commissioner of Police. The people who gathered were-dispersed, but some stone throwing by hooligans followed.Madras.The situation during the week has been generally quiet. Sporadic picketing by small parties of volunteers continued in Madras and in some places in the Mofussil. There have been no serious attempts to hold unlawful meetings. The dispersal, of volunteers was effected without incident. Fifteen more associations have been declared unlawful, making a total of 89. The total number of persons convicted up to date is 453, and 53 persons and two presses have been bound over.The situation everywhere is under control.North-West Frontier Province.The situation has continued to improve slowly but steadily and without any serious set-backs in the Peshawar district. The City, and the Nowshera and Charsadda tahsils have been quiet and well behaved. Revenue payments in Charsadda have been most satisfactory. There is still agitation in the Mohmand Tappa, south of Peshawar. In Mardan subdivision the situation has improved in the Katland area, 660&quot;     60   1.32
but is not yet satisfactory. On 16th January, near Gujrat, north-east of Mardan, villagers attacked a small police escort and attempted to release prisoners. The police had to fire, killing one villager and wounding another. Landkhwar village, which is suspected of being the centre from which secret orders have been emanating, was visited by the column yesterday and a number of Congress papers were seized. Owing to the improved situation in the Maira-Mohmand tract the column has been withdrawn to Mardan. Kohat district is satisfactorj&apos;- except for a recrudescence of agitation in the backward tracts of the Khattak area; resulting in a number of villagers offering themselves for arrest. The Bannu situation has been very satisfactory throughout the week. In n&apos;installera Ismail Khan, the situation in Tank tahsil is now easier and the Maliks are exercising some measure of control although agitation still continues. On the whole the situation is very satisfactory. Interest in reforms and -a revulsion of feeling against the Congress are spreading, and propaganda on these lines is being effective, but wild stories spread by Congress agents continue to gain credence and cause excitement in some areas. Much will depend on the maintenance -of the present improvement during the second half of Ramzan, to counteract the excitement which may normally be expected after Id. Forty-five arrests have been made under the Emergency Powers Ordinance during the week.United Provinces.The situation is outwardly more peaceful.   Nine districts report conditions to be practically normal and agitation and defiance of orders to be less marked. Allahabad is comparatively quiet with few processions. Lucknow, both city and district, is quite.Cawnpore is more peaceful with little agitation in villages ; rent and revenue is coming in steadily but slowly. Two incidents of note were, first, an encounter in Budaun district between small force of police and a Congress leader accompanied by -a large and threatening crowd. When the leader was arrested the crowd attacked the police, and eight shots were fired, resulting iu one death and three injured. The mob subsequently looted some shops in the bazaar. The second incident was the murder of a man in the United Provinces district who had given evidence in four cases under the Ordinance. The murder is believed to be result of this evidence. A number of Congress offices have been taken into possession, and cash and securities amounting to Rs. 24,000 belonging to Prem Mahavidyalaya at Brindaben have been seized. Picketing on a small scale is reported from seven districts, partly by women. Underground propaganda for boycotting British goods is being organised, specially .at Cawnpore. Convictions during the Week were, under Ordinances, 312; under ordinary law, 580.   Total convictions up to date, 1,623.   Released on apology, 281.Ajmer Merwara.There has been little Congress activity during the past week. Nine persons have been arrested. Batches of volunteers are reported to be coming to the district from other Provinces or States. A certain number of persons sympathise with the civil disobedience movement, but at present are inactive, watching events, and hoping for support from outside. Attempts may be made to organise demonstrations on Independence Lay, 26th January.   Everything is quiet in the rural area.Bihar and Orissa.The Province is generally quiet, but picketing continues in Balasore and Cattack, necessitating rather numerous arrests. More picketing activities are reported from Champparan, where there has also been an extension of the no-rent campaign in three than as.   Total convictions up to 19th January are about 650.Assam.Some agitators in Sylhet are still endeavouring, by meetings and speeches, to arouse enthusiasm for the civil disobedience movement and secure volunteers. Hitherto they have not met with much success. Picketing has been attempted in some centres and, in Sunamganj, four persons, including two women, have been convicted under the Prevention of Molestation and Boycott Ordinance. All is quiet at present in Assam Valley.
From the Resident, Mysore.In Bangalore 48 persons have been imprisoned since the I6th, including two troublesome individuals handed over by Mysore State. In addition, three juveniles have been whipped. There have been feeble attempts at picketing. Ordinances 1 and 5 have been extended to the station.   The situation generally is satisfactory.Coorcj. Twenty-two convictions up to date. Local Congress Committee declared unlawful under Criminal Law Amendment Act.   Situation is very satisfactorv.Burma.Satisfactory progress continues and further surrenders and captures of remaining leaders are taking place. It is hoped that the projected rising in Zigon Subdivision has been definitely crushed. In Pegu district a small party of civil police were fired on in the jungle, and a head constable was wounded. The head constable has since died in hospital. No other casiialties reported. Sixty-eight under-trial prisoners released, and the number remaining in custody is 584. The paddy market is firm, with a slight upward tendency. Satisfactory progress has been made in the collection of capitation tax and Thathahameda. In Thayetmyo district, 95 per cent, of capitation tax has been paid in.   The number on relief works is about the same.There is nothing of importance to report about political situation. Burmans take no interest in Indian news. Indians have expressed indignation at the recent arrests of J. M. Sen Gupta and others, but no hartals or demonstrations have occurred.No arrests have beeu made in Burma.-Bengal.Civil disobedience has been keep alive in Calcutta on a small scale The National Bank of India has been picketed. The movement is only causing anxiety in Munshiganj Subdivision, Dacca, but the situation is controlled there. Some activity is expected on the 2(5th January, Independence Day. The number of arrests under section 3 totals 120. Terrorists have assaulted a police sergeant at Dacca, stealing 3. revolver, and also threw a bomb into a compartment of a train occupied by the District Magistrate, Howrah.Punjab.There has been somewhat more Congiess activity in Lahore and Amritsar; -elsewhere Congress efforts continue to be ineffectual. In Amritsar the arrest of the first batches of volunteers, as well as internal Congress factions and personal rivalries combined to delay Congress activities, but the preaching of boycott has -continued and picketing is now threatened. In Lahore house to house canvassing by women has continued, and picketing commenced on the 18th and has continued daily. Counter measures taken have been the demand of securitj7&apos; from one uewspaper and one press, arrests of 50 male and eight women volunteers, the arrest of nine leaders, -and the serving of three orders under the Emergency Powers Ordinance. The effect on the Amritsar piece-goods market has been a virtual preference for Japanese goods. Lahore cloth market, which is less important, is beginning to be disturbed. Dealers are complaining more of the crowds that attend arrests than of the picketers themselves. Special difficulties have arisen from the narrowness of the streets in the cloth bazar and the consequent difficulty of traffic control, from women&apos;s activities -as picketers and cauvassers, and from the fact that as a result of most of the first-class leaders being under restraint, the lesser personalities now in charge do not, and perhaps cannot control meetings and crowds, whose tendency to rowdyism is increasing.Central Provinces.The civil disobedience movement has made no progress during the week in Nagpirr. The arrest of leaders has had a good effect and, except for slight trouble in Wardha, the division has been quiet. In J ubbulpore Division, meetings have been dispersed in Saugor and Khandwa, but elsewhere the position is nomal. In Raipur, the situation is reported to be very quiet. Some references have been made at meetings to the difficulties of rental payment and there has been mild picketing in Balaghat. In Berar, leaders have been touring to explain that the -breach of the pact was due entirely to Government and that foreign goods should be boycotted, but speeches have not been violent and in many cases have been studiously
moderate. The Unlawful Association Ordinance has been applied to Nimar and Saugor districts, the Molestation and Boycotting Ordinance to Nimar, and the Unlawful Instigation Ordinance to Bilaspur. The total number of persons arrested since the beginning of the movement is 256 and the total number convicted 166.Government of India.Delhi reports some slight increase in Congress activity, but nothing serious. Satisfactory features of the provincial reports are : (a) Decreasing extent to which it is necessaiy to make arrests under section 3 of the Emergency Powers Ordinance, especially in the North-West Frontier Province.(b) Very slight extent to which rural areas are at present affected.(c) Steady improvement in the North-West Frontier Province.(d) More peaceful conditions in the towns of the United Provinces.On the other hand, there has been some extension of activities in particular areas,, with signs that Congress are making efforts to recover from the initial blow. In. particular, the effects of silent boycott are more marked.
