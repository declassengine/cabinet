DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT ). RET. C i&apos; CABINET.AGRICULTURAL POLICY - THE HOME vVHEAT QUOTA.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.1.      The Cabinet at their meeting on the 25th November last, (Cabinet 81 (31) Conclusion 4), authorised me to announce that the Government had decided to apply the principle of&quot; a quota to home-produced millable wheat, and intended to introduce legislation to enable the decision to become effective for the whea-t crop of2.     The announcement was made in the House of Commons on the 26th November, 1931.    On the 2nd December, I laid before the Cabinet (Cabinet 84 (31) Conclusion 6) a Memorandum (CP.302 (31)) outlining a plan which I proposed to disouss with the principal organisations concerned.    I then said that it might become necessary, as the result of these discussions, to make some modifications of, detail.3.     The discussions in which other Departments participated were begun at once, and my colleagues might like to know that agreement has now been reached   with the industries.    1 am proceeding with the drafting of tne Bill which I will submit in due course, and meanwhile I am circulating herewith the agreed plan for information.4.      In my announcement in the House of Commons, I stated that the Government had decided to apply the principle of a quota to secure an enhanced price and a certain market for home grown wheat of millable quality, that there would be no subsidy from the Exchequer, and that no encouragement would be graven to the extension of wheat-growing to land unsuitable for the purpose.COPY NO.2 (32).1932......-:3?
5. Subject to these governing conditions, I havebeen prepared to consider any modification of the original plahdesigned to meet legitimate criticism from the trade interests, aff ected..6. The agreed plan retains essential features of the original proposals.     These include prescribing a quota, defining a minimum standard of millable quality for wheat, creating wheat certificates On the first sale of wheat by the grower, and the satisfaction of the quote-obligation of flour millers and importers) by the purchase and surrender of wheat certificates or an equivalent document.7. The main features in which the modified differs from the original plan are the continuance of a free market for all home-grown wheat instead of a restricted and regulated market, the establishment of a Wheat Commission appointed by the Minister to advise him and to operate the scheme in place of a producers&apos; Marketing Board, the abolition of trading in wheat certificates, the imposition upon flour millers of an obligation to purchase wheat unsold on fanas in June and July of each year, and the payment of the balance of the enhanced price by the Wheat Commission to growers At the end of each cereal year instead of on the actual sale of the wheat.     provision is also made for organisations of flour millers and importers to act collectively for their members in certain matters.     The agreed plan holds the balance fairly between flour importer and home miller.8.  When I submit the draft Bill for my colleagues&apos; consideration I will put forward recommendations in regard to (1) the maximum quantity of wheat (para. 1 of the plan), and (2) the &quot;basic&quot; price (para. 15 of the plan).9. My colleagues will realise that it has been necessary\
necessary to discuss the proposals with a comparatively large number of individuals, and that wide publicity, generally ill-informed, has been given to these discussions. The fact that agreement with the industries ooncemed has been reached is now well lcnownj and it is becoming increasingly difficult to resist the desire of the principal organisation to convey the details of the plan to their members generally.      In these circumstances, I shall be glad to have the authority of my oolleagues to release for public information a summarised version of the annexed plan.(Intld. ) J.G.inistry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 14th January, 1932.\

For the purpose of
this provision, 100 cwts. of wheat are to he taken as the wheat-equivalent of 66^ cwts. of flour.The Minister may vary the quota from time to time, but so far as practicable, the quota shall be maintained at a uniform figure during the course of a cereal year, and, averaged over the cereal year, shall represent the proportion which the &quot;estimated supply&quot; bears to the wheat-equivalent of the total amount of the deliveries of home-milled flour and the retained imports of flour in the United Kingdom as estimated by the Commission (see also para. 12). 3.    Fulfilment of Quota Obligations.(a)   Flour Millers shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of any Order prescribing a wheat quota:-(i) on production to the ^heat Commission, by them, or by the Flour Millers&apos; Corporation (para. 19) on their behalf, of evidence of the purchase of home-grown wheat in the form of Wheat Certificates or other suitable documents equivalent to such Certificates, and known as &quot;prescribed documents&quot;, corresponding with the amount of their quota obligations.(ii) on the purchase by the Flour Millers&apos; Corporation,if so required by the Minister, on the advice of the Wheat Commission, of any home-grown wheat of millable quality of the previous harvest remaining unsold on farms during the months of June and July in any year and tendered, in the prescribed manner, by the wheat Commission, provided that the quantity of wheat so tendered, together with the quantity of certificated wheat already sold during the cereal year, shall not exceed the &quot;estimated supply&quot;.
