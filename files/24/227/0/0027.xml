At the outset we feel bound to place on record the very serious outlook for the his armament Conference, which has prompted this proposal.    France ha? laid down her policy at the. Disarmament Conference in aMemorandum dated July 17,  19 31&apos;.    From this document itlittleis clear that there is /   prospect of any serious measureof French disarmament unless she receives some furthersatisfaction in the matter of security .   Without somemarked advance by Franee it is not unlikely that Germany,given the present internal political situation, mayrefuse to remain in the Conference.

TheLeaf rue of Nations itself, even, if it. survives soshattering a blow, will, for a ion.? time to come, hecrippled and. emasculated.    It will no longer provide thesafeguard of peace that for many years has been held, by successive Governments to justify the assumptionunderlying our defensive preparations ^ that there willhe no war for ten years from any given date, and the consequential low scale of armaments to which the three defence Cervices have been reduced.    The country maythen he faced with a situation in which the choice
o y (jwill lie between the rehabilitation of our armaments at a cost^^^wliirjh. we cannot afford and which British public opinion might be slow to authorise, and the acceptance of a situation in which Prance,  fully armed, exercises hegemony in Europe.5. It is in order to avert r* situation fraught with so much anxiety by offering France some further degree of security,  that the proposal for a Mediterranean Locarno has been put forward   in Sir Robert Vansittart&apos;s case not as a proposal that he favours on its merito, but as possibly the less of two evils with which the National Government may find itself confronted,  and therefore, event\.ially, as the principal feature of a comprehensive policy embracing other proposals as well.    It is known that- for some years France has desired&apos; something of the hind, and it is believed that the French relegation may put the proposal forward at the Disarmament Conference.   Whether she will offer an adequate measure of disarmament in return&apos;for that alone, or whether she will aim at some wider plan,  such as the Geneva Protocol of 1924. we have no means of knowing.&quot;tt6. What France stands to gain in the event of a Mediterranean Locarno is, firstly,  a guaranteed protection from Italian naval attack for her transports crossing the Mediterranean with troops from North Africa destined for the defence of France:    and, secondly, a. more general protection of her- Possessions in the Mediterranean, includ-ing those in North Africa,  against aggression by Italy.    In this way the guarantee agains t an aggression by Germany provided by the Locarno Treaty would be supplemented by a. corresponding guarantee against aggression by Italy.    But, whereas  in the case of the major Locarno guarantee no defi-nite price was exacted from France in the direction of dis-armament, if has been suggested that, in return for this secondary giiarantee in the Mediterranean, we should insist on   a   larger   measure   of   disarmament,
including reduction of French submarines and aeroplanes at least to our level.7.    The proposal can conveniently be considered under three headings:--1 . If we can get our price,  is it worth while? -&quot;&quot;&quot; &apos; -*2. Can we get our price?v-------5.  If we fail to get our price, are we better or worse off?IV.8. The first of the above questions raises the whole issue of the advantages and disadvantages of the scheme.9. . From a purely British standpoint one advantage would be avoidance of the necessity of increasing our destroyer strength in order to counter the great strength of the French Navy in submarines,  involving resort to the &quot;escalator&quot; clause of the London Naval Treaty.10.    A second advantage would be relief from the formidable menace in the air to which we are at present exposed,  owing to the great numerical superiority of the French air forces,  and which would become more formidable in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 4.11.    A third advantage would be the easing of the tension between France and Italy, with its potentialities of naval rivalry in the Mediterranean and its reactions on our naval construction programme as limited, by the London Naval Treaty.12,    Added to the above is the expectation that thoe conclusion of such an agreement would enable the French Government to adopt a more accommodating attitude towards the whole problem of disarmament,
9 -f iu x X13.    The disadvantages are numerous and weighty.1 if.   A political objection is that any scheme involving further guarantees and commitments in favour of France would be unpopular.      It would be difficult to persuade public opinion here to accept a guarantee sufficiently effective to give satisfaction to Prance.15.   A second political objection is that the Dominions are very unlikely to participate in any Mediterranean guarantee.      As pointed out in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee, the guarantee,  if entered into in such circumstances, would be likely to weaken the bonds which unite the Empire, particularly if as a result we became involved in actual hostilities. Even in normal times the existence of a Mediterranean Locarno agreement would be likely to exercise a detrimental effect on the naval co-operation which Australia and New Zealand now give, and hope to give in greater degree when economic conditions improve.16. A third political objection is that the agree-ment,  once concluded, will he continued into a future when circumstances may have changed for the worse and have increased both the risk and the liability. If the term of the Treaty was limited its value to France would he diminished and the price we could demand would have to he lowered .17. The military objections to the proposal are very considerable.   Tlr   proposal envisages assistance either to France against Italy or to Italy against France.     In the former case hostilities might at least he limited to the Mediterranean.    Put they could not he confined to naval action.    Attacks by air and by sea, including landing operations against our naval base at-5-
0 4 t) &amp; XMalta, would come within the range of possibilities. The three Defence Services would all be liable to become engaged in hostilities.   &quot;Ihere would be a demand, in time of peace,  for Malta to be put. in a state of defence to resist the formidable scale of attack that Italy could bring to bear and for the provision of alternative Naval facilities  on an increased scale at Gibraltar, both involving heavy expenditure.18. In the other case in which we were called upon to assist Italy against France, the scope of operations could not be limited to the Mediterranean, but would involve hostilities on the widest scale, including attacks on London by air, and on our maritime communica-tions wherever they are assailable by French forces. The liability in this case cannot be limited in a geographical sense to the Mediterranean.    It is hardly too much to say that, in order to protect Italy against France, we should, have to involve the whole of Europe in war .Further, we should be committed to the maintenance of Italy&apos;s communications in the Mediterranean It has been recognised that modern methods of attack would make the maintenance of our own communications in the Mediterranean a matter of extreme difficulty in the event of war with France.    The question of routes alternative to the Mediterranean has consequently been investigated by the Committee of Imperial Defence and found practicable,  if necessary.In the case of Italy&apos;s communications no alternative routes are possible and consequently in guaranteeing those communications against France we should be accepting a naval commitment in the Medi-terranean considerably greater than that involved in
0-2 9O I Othe protection of our own communications.   To honour this commitment it might he necessary to concentrate such considerable naval forces in the Mediterranean as seriously to prejudice the protection of our own communications in other parts of the world.19. A Mediterranean Locarno, then, would tend to increase the risk of our being drawn into a European conflict, and the additional commitment, super-imposed on commitments for Imperial Defence which even today we are barely able to meet, would involve addit iona 1 expenditure.SO. The guarantee in the case of a Mediterran-ean Locarno would probably he somewhat wider than in that of the original Locarno Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, which is confined to the maintenance of a territorial status quo and inviolability of frontiers.SI. So far - - the question has been examined on the basis of a Treaty limited to the United Kingdom, France and. Italy. It is by no means certain, however, whether it could, he confined so narrowly. Even a scheme restricted&quot; to the three countries might be brought into operation as the outcome of hostilities arising between Italy and Jugo-Slavia involving France.    In 1930 the......Spanish Government Insisted strongly on its right to participate in any discussions affecting the western ha sin of the Mediterranean.    A. scheme embracing other States with a Mediterranean seaboard would extend the commitment.   Turkey, however, not being a member of the League of Nations, could hardly be included.-6A-
9 i f\O i. lx22. On balance, the above considerations raise grave doubts as to whether,  even if we could get our price, the proposed guarantee would be worth while .&apos;   VI.23. The question now arises as to whether we could get our price.   As the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet, his experience in the conversations during the London Naval Conference, 1930,  does not encourage the belief that  Prance would pay a heavy price for a Mediterranean Locarno.   The lowest price that has been suggested includes at least equality in submarines and in aimeraft.    The former would involve a reduction of about 45,000 tons of modern submarines, a weapon to which the French are especially attached,  partly on the senti-mental ground that it is claimed as a French invention. The adjustment of French claims in Cruisers and Destroyers would involve further sacrifices on their part.&quot; The air force reductions would hardly be more palatable.   To these reductions must be added a diminution in land forces which, even if not part of the agreement, would be essential to the success of a general Disarmament Convention.24. On the whole, then, the prospects of our obtaining a satisfactory price are far from promising.
85. On the question of whether we should he better-off if v?e made the offer of a Mediterranean Locarno and failed to secure acceptance there are two views.    One is that we should he no worse&apos;off.   We should have made a very impressive effort and have vindicated beyond doubt our readiness to make sacrifices in order to secure a measure of disarmament.85. The other vie1&quot; is that the situation would develop in a less decisive manner.    Our offer would he met by a counter-offer of an unsatisfactory character. A bargaining process would, begin,  and in the end we might find ourselves saddled with the odium of being responsi-hle for standing in the way of some measure of dissr.ma-men t which, although below our minimum conditions. would he represented to the world as substantial.VIII. 7. At this moment no-one can foretell whether the prospects of the Disarmament Conference are as gloomy as we have sketched them at the out set. of this Report. We are incensed that few responsible people in Europe can he found to predict success .    There is even, we feel, a possibility that France herself may realise    the danger;, of a breakdown   and. make an effort to avert it.80. Our Delegates will, we may he sure, face the situation with confidence and enthusiasm, hut we do not conceal from the Cabinet that before very long they may be confronted with political difficulties of the first-order of magnitude if the Conference is to be saved.29. Our general conclusion is that the failure of the Disarmament Conference would be a disaster, theTrnnTn -rMii.inmi.iKii.il_i aitr--^^^*&apos;1J&apos;&apos;&quot;M&apos;w&apos;&apos;^-^.....    &quot;feffects of which can hardly he measured.   We have
V 6 *j x \jearnestly considered a Mediterranean Locarno Agreement as one of the measures that might be adopted to avert such a catastrophe, but we cannot recommend the Cabinet to authorise the Delegation of the United Kingdom to put forward or agree to the proposition.    Our advice, however, is without prejudice to the possibility of a reopening of the question in connection with any possible reconsideration of the whole political situation, which may be necessary in order to avert a breakdown of the Disarmament Conference.Signed on behalf of the Committee J.RAMSAY MACDONALD, (Chairman) .2, Whit eh all Garde ns    S .W . 1, January 18, 19 32.
A P, P END IX.Extract from the Conclusions of a Meeting of the Cabinet held on Tuesday,  January 14, 19 30 (Cabinet 1 (50), Conclusion 1 E).&quot;Proposed MediterraneanAgreement. rAttempts will no doubt be made to bring into discussion at the Conference cognate political matters such as a Mediterranean Agreement.    These we must resist on principle, and strive to keep the Conference to Naval business .   We may find it impossible, however, to do that with absolute rigidity,  and in order to open the way for reason-able agreements we may have to indicate our willingness to consider certain political points. Our general attitude, however, must be unwilling-ness, and we ought to oppose- every attempt to embody such agreements in the Naval Agreement.   Furthermore, in-speaking about these agreements we must make it clear that this country will refuse to take upon itself any obligations over and above those which it has already undertaken under the Covenant of the League of Nations, Locarno Agreement,  etc.&quot;
