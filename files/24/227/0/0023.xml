If we had not Insisted upon the balancing of the budget, the credit of India in London would not have taken the favourable course of the last three months - a reso.lt in striking contrast with the turn of events during the first session of the round Table Conference eThe balancing of the budget was initiated and pressed from here and the exchange decision was taken in the teeth of Indian opposition,,      Whilst I should be the last person to claim universal infallibility for Whitehall, the course that events have taken seems to me to illustrate the advantage of control at least upon this occasion.      It also goes to show how wisely I was advised by my own experts and how full3&apos; justified the Treasury and the Bank of England were in supporting them*(Intld)0    So HoIndia Office, SoWdo 15th January 1932c
