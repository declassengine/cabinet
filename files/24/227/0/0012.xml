Thi?\ ^oamenfc is the property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1932.SECRET.Copy No. qCP. 12 (32).THE CABINET.DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE: PROPOSED   FIGURES OF LIMITATION FOR PERSONNEL AND EXPENDITURE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Memorandum by the Army Council.H.The War Office,9th January, 1932.MEMORANDUM BY THE ARMY COUNCIL.Genebal Considebations.1. Following upon the receipt of the Draft Convention drawn up by the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, which, together with an accompanying report and a despatch from Viscount Cecil, was published as Command Paper No. 3757, the Army Council have had under consideration the recommendations which they should make in connection therewith. Before dealing with the proposed figures of limitation for personnel and expenditure, the Council desire to make some observations of a general character.2. The reductions made in personnel have already been recorded elsewhere, but it is desirable to repeat them in this paper. After the war, we were the first nation in Europe to revert immediately to our pre-war Army and voluntary service. Moreover, the Special Reserve, which had been an important factor in our pre-war mobilization arrangements, was abolished, including, in addition to other arms, 3 Special Reserve cavalry regiments and 101 Special Reserve infantry battalions. In 1921, the military advisers of the Government even accepted the risk of heavy reductions below the 1914 standard, in view of the Cabinet decision that a major war was unlikely&apos; for ten years. The Army was then reduced by 9 cavalry regiments, 61 batteries and companies of artillery, 21 companies of engineers, 21 battalions of British infantry and 6 battalions of Colonial and native troops.3. At the same time, there has been a continued reduction in Army Estimates amounting, during the six years ending 1931, to over  4 million, that is 10 per cent, of the net estimate of 1925. These net reductions have been made notwithstanding the fact that, during the same period, the Appropriations in Aid of Army Votes have fallen by over  3 million. This tendency has been due in no small measure to the desire of successive Governments to take some practical steps in the direction of disarmament and to the insistent pressure of financial stringency, which have led to the progressive restriction of the sums granted to the Army. It has been possible to keep within these reduced Estimates only by a searching overhaul of all military expenditure and by the postponement of a number of absolutely necessary Services. At present, Army Estimates are abnormally low, chiefly because strengths are seriously below establishments, and because the existence of surplus stocks (now approaching exhaustion) has reduced current purchases below normal. ^(b32/8)   60   1/82   w.o.r.   6957
4. The low level o  our Estimates has also been possible owing to the decision oi successive Cabinets that &quot;it should be assumed, for the purposes of framing Estimates of the Fighting Services, that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years &quot;. This decision has recently been examined in a Foreign Office memorandum (D.C. (P) 46) and the conclusion is reached that the &quot;ten years&apos; rule&quot; can only be safely continued subject to five conditions, none of which is at present being fulfilled.5. Furthermore, it is clear that any figure of limitation inserted in the forthcoming Convention will be regarded as a maximum which, unless world conditions change considerably, we shall be bound at future conferences not to exceed. We cannot, therefore, afford to stabilize for all time at our existing level. Certain increases in Army Estimates will be automatic, while in other cases expenditure for essential services is long overdue. Unless there is a radical alteration in the military policy of the country and a substantial reduction in our military commitments, it is impossible to accept our current expenditure or establishments as a standard of limitation for the future. The deterioration in the international situation, wdth even graver possibilities in the future, makes it a matter of elementary prudence to reserve our position by ensuring a substantial margin for establishments and for expenditure above the present abnormally low level.Pkesonnkl.6. Tables I, II and III annexed to Chapter A of Part E of the Draft Convention provide for the limitation of the total of ta) all ranks, (b) officers, and (c) other ranks of more than &quot; x &quot; months service, serving respectively at home, overseas, and at home and overseas combined.7. As the number &quot; x &quot; has been left for the Disarmament Conference to determine, it is as yet impossible to compute the figures for long service personnel referred to under (c) above.8. Table II is optionnl and involves the separate limitation of &quot; armed forces &quot; stationed overseas. This is contrary to our inten-sts, as it might prevent the despatch of reinforcements overseas. The Council do not recommend, therefore, that we should accept limitation under this table.9. Tables IV and V deal with &quot; formations organized on a military basis,&quot; which are defined in Article 4 of the Draft Convention Such &quot;formations&quot; (Table IV) do not exist at home, and such as exist overseas (Table Y) are administered by Colonial Governments.10. As India is a separate member of the League, it will not be necessary to include any troops in India in the figures for Great Britain. It wall be for the Colonial Office to present the relevant figures for the &quot;armed forces&quot; (Table HI) and &quot;formations organized on a military basis&quot; (Table Y) which are maintained by Colonial Governments.11. In order to arrive at figures for limitation of personnel to be recommended for insertion in the Convention (after the addition of Colonial Office figures in regard to Tables III and Y), it is necessary to ascertain, first of all, what are our existing figures for personnel, as measured by the standard prescribed in Article 3 of the Draft Convention, namely, that of 11 average daily effectives.&quot; The definition of this term &quot; average daily effectives&quot; leaves vague a number of points which will have to be settled at the Disarmament Conference. For the most part, these are of minor importance, and will not materially affect the totals. One point, however, deseiwes attention, namely the question as to whether periods of temporary absence on leave, in hospital, etc., should be counted as days of duty, or should be excluded. The Council are in favour of counting such periods as days of duty, principally for the sake of simplicity, and have adopted that method of calculation in the returns actually submitted to the League, as have the Admiralty and the Air Ministry ; they recommend that endeavour should be made at Geneva to get this procedure accepted.12. The Council hold strongly that establishments and not strengths should be taken as the basis of the limitation figures in i-espect of the British Army for insertion in the Convention. Establishments are fixed by Parliament, whereas strengths vary according to the state of recruiting. It is at least legally possible to recruit up to establishment at any time, but not above.On these premises, a table has been prepared showing the establishment of the British Army for 1931 translated into terms of &quot;average daily effectives,&quot; and is
114attached as an Appendix to this Memorandum. Normal (but nut maximum legal) periods of training for Army Reserve, Supplementary Reserve and Territorial Army are reckoned.13. For reasons discussed in detail below, the figures given in the Appendix cannot be accepted for limitation purposes, and it will be necessary to add a margin. The following are the more likely contingencies which such a margin should be designed to cover without having recourse :o the derogation clause provided in the Convention (Article 50) : (a) Temporary and occasional excesses over and above establishment caused bytrooping. In a normal year, this might increase the average daily effectives by anything up to 1,000 and for this purpose a pool is allowed for in Army Estimates, but has been excluded from the figures given in the Appendix.(b) The present distribution of our forces cannot be regarded as permanent.Circumstances might necessitate a redistribution of the Army involving a transfer of troops from (i) the Colonies to Home, or (ii) from India to other parts of the Empire.(i) Transfer of troops from the Colonies to Home.This involves only a redistribution of, and not an addition to, our Total Forces, and. while an allowance for such transfer must be made in Table I (Land Forces at Home), no allowance need be made in this respect in Table III (Total Land Forces).(ii) Transfer of Troops from India to Home and the Colonies.This would involve an addition to our total Land Forces, and allowance for this must be made in Table III (Total Land Forces). In so far as such troops from India may be stationed at home, allowance must be made in Table I (Land Forces at Home) as well.(c) The possibility of basing the Expeditionary Force requirements on a more rapid rate of despatch. Additional requirements to mobilize the whole Expeditionary Force at &quot; Z &quot; are approximately : Regulars        ............    12,000Regular Reserve       ...       ......    32,000Supplementary Reserve       ...       ...    15,000This would mean an increase in the average daily effectives of about 12,500.(d) If the 14 Divisions and 2 Cavalry Brigades of the Territorial Army Field Army(excluding coast defence and all provided for under (e) below) were placed on war establishment with the full quota of units required in war, but not raised at present, the Territorial Army war establishment would then be some 305,000 greater than the present peace establishment; this is equivalent to an addition of 16,650 average daily effectives.(e) The creation of additional  R.A. and R.E. units for the coast defences,anti-aircraft, etc., and the addition of the missing air-defence units for the London defences, and the completion to war establishment of coast defence units would mean an addition of 12,000 Territorial Army personnel, equivalent to an addition of 660 average daily effectives.The increases at (d) and (e) are not merely increases which would be required after mobilization. If foreign relations were to become what they were from 1909 onwards, it might well be thought necessary to raise the -Territorial Army to the scale which obtained in 1914, when the peace establishment was equal to the war establishment.14. It is impossible to make exact calculations based upon the contingencies enumerated above, if only because the numbers involved by certain of them, notably those comprised under (b) above, are not predictable.(6957) A 2
Having weighed these contingencies carefully in relation to the general military situation, and bearing in mind particularly the fundamental considerations outlined in paragraphs 2-5 above, the Council are compelled, to recommend that a margin of 22,900 &quot; average daily effectives,&quot; equivalent to L4\5 per cent., should be allowed above the establishment for 1931, as given in the Appendix, in assessing the figure acceptable for the limitation of our Total Land Forces (Table III). This is, in their opinion, the lowest margin compatible with the security of the Empire.15. The margin for inclusion in Table 1 (Land Forces at Home) will differ slightly, because transfers from the Colonies to Home involve an increase in this Table, though they do not affect Table ill (Total Land Forces). After an investi-gation of the various factors involved, the Council are of opinion that an additional margin of 1,000 average daily effectives is required in Table I on this account.16. Therefore, assuming the methods of calculation of average daily effectives adopted in this Memorandum, the Council recommend that the following limitation figures for the British Army should be inserted in Tables I and III annexed to Chapter A of Part I of the Draft Convention : Table 1. Maximum Land Armed Forces stationed in the Home Country.Total. Officers.Average daily effectives...       ...   151,821 9,764Table III. Maximum of the Total Land Armed Forces.Total. Officers.Average daily effectives......   180,882 11,213To the figures in Table III must be added the figures for Colonial Armed Forces referred to in paragraph 11.Limitation of Expenditure.Provisions of the Draft (invention dealing with Budgetary Limitation.17. The requirements of the Draft Convention as affecting Army expenditure may be summarized as follows : (a) Limitation of total annual expenditure on armed forces. - (Article 29.)(b) Limitation of annual expenditure on war materiel for land forces. (Article 10.)(c) Publicity of annual figures in a Model Statement to show that the limitsunder (a) and (6) have not been exceeded.   (Articles 33 and 39.)Separate Limitation and &quot; Firement.&quot;18. Under the Convention as at present drafted, the limitation of total expenditure (paragraph 20 (a)) would be applied to tin: three Services combined. The British Delegate at the Preparatory Commission pressed for separate limits for the army, navy and air force of each country. The Committee of Budgetary Experts were asked to decide whether such separate limitation wrould be practicable, and have replied in the affirmative. They also point out that, if separate limitation is adopted, the question of permitting a limited degree of virement between the three limits for any one country may arise. The Council have already stated that they are in favour of separate limitation and opposed to any measure of virement. (O.I.D. Paper 1025 B, of 12th November, 1930.) The recommendations made below as to the figures to be accepted for limitation are based on the assumption that this view will prevail. If virement be approved, these recommendations will require reconsideration.Limitation Figure for Total Expenditure on the Land Armed Forces.w 19. Our total expenditure on the: Army, and ,on war materiel for it, calculated as far as possible in accordance with the instructions proposed by the Committee of Budgetary Experts is, on the basis of 1930 Estimates, as follows :--   &amp;(a) Total expenditure ...       ...       ...       ...       38*5 million.(b) War materiel        ... ...       ____      : 3*9 million.
For the reasons which have been set out under the heading &quot; General Considerations,&quot; the Council are convinced that it would be wrong to accept limitation at figures approximating closely to the above, and that a margin to provide for certain contingencies is essential. These contingencies may be thought of in two classes : (i) Those which may arise automatically owing to the fact that present estimates are based upon financial and military conditions which are in many ways abnormal(ii) Those which would result from the execution of certain specific services which are in contemplation, but for which provision in Estimates is either partial or absent.20. The &quot; automatic&quot; contingencies, referred to in (i) above, relate to two abnormalities in present conditions, viz.: (a) The Regular Army, the Supplementary Reserve, and the Territorial Armyarei now considerably below establishment, and provision must be made for an improvement in recruiting.(b) Expenditure on stores has been exceptionally low since the war owing toaccumulation of surplus war stocks, which are now approaching exhaustion.The provision necessary to cover these &quot; automatic &quot; contingencies is calculated to be as follows : Additional annual expenditure.  (i) Shortage of 10,000 on establishment of the Regular Army...   1,000,000(ii) Shortage on establishment of the Supplementary Reserve  ...       45,000(iii) Shortage on establishment of the Territorial Army ...       ...      200,000(iv) Exhaustion of stocks ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   1,500,000Total...............   2,745,000In addition, a non-recurring charge of  200,000 will he necessary if the shortage on establishment of the Territorial Army is made up ( (iii) above). On the other hand, certain annual savings are anticipated over the next five years, in particular : *  (1) Army Reserve............       100,000(2) New rates of pay        .........      500,000These savings may, however, be counter-balanced either wholly or in part by rises in prices and/or by increases in pay of the Royal Army Medical Corps, etc.21. As regards the other contingencies included under (ii) of paragraph 19 above, no programme of annual expenditure has been drawn up, and consequently no accurate estimate of the obligations which may be incurred can be made. An explanation of these contingencies is given below ; against each a figure has been set which is regarded as a reasonable anticipation of the annual amount which may be involved. The Convention will probably cover a period of five years ; the annual sums given below do not in most cases provide for the completion of the project within that time.Estimated additional annual expenditure. (a) Effectives.Pay and maintenance of an additional 22,900 effectives above present establishments, as recommended in paragraph 14 above       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   3,500,000(b) Singapore.Only about  600,000 out of a total estimated sum of  2,000,000 from Army Votes for the &quot; first stage &quot; alone has so far been provided. Work is now suspended until November, 1935. The cost of the second stage may exceed  1,000,000    ......      ............      ...      200,000(5957)
Estimated additional annual expenditure.  (c) Land.In particular, purchase of land at frnber, for which  400,000 has yet to be provided.  40,000 is provided in 1930 Estimates, and no increase on this bas been assumed ...         (d) Works.The provision on the Works Vote for normal upkeep and replacement services is at present at a low level. There are in addition contingent liabilities in respect of barrack accommodation for the increased garrison in the Ear East, and for any redistribution of troops involving an increase in the Home Establishments, and in respect of accommodation for the repair of mechanical vehicles...       ...       ...       ...      750,000(e) Mechanization.A policy is contemplated involving capital expenditure of several millions     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      500,000(/) Coast Defence.The question of modernizing the defences of defended ports at home and abroad has become one Of grave urgency. In the last 30 years, no general reorganization has taken place, and, since the war, the coast defences of the Empire have been completely neglected. Not only have no steps been taken to. modernize them, but the existing armament has not been maintained in a state of efficiency. Moreover, in the majority..of ports, effective defence against the new menace from.the air is practically non-existent. In order to bring our coast defences up to date, no less than about  7J million will be required, and this figure does not include  2^ million for the Singapore Base (see (b) above;      500,000(g)- Clothing for the Territorial Army.At present, clothing and equipment exist only for the peace establishment of the Territorial Army and not, as it did in 1914, for the war establishment. It may be found desirable to provide this in peace as a mobilization store. The total amount involved is  1,150,000   .........      :^30,000(h) Anti-Aircraft Defences of London.We may be required to make provision in advance for the equipment and armament of the anti-aircraft defences of London.   The total amount involved is  1,500,000        ...      300,000Total additional annual expenditure regarded as areasonable provision for the above contingencies ...   5,980,00022. On the basis of the considerations given in paragraphs 20 and 21 above, the Council recommend that the following margin should be allowed over the estimated expenditure for 1930 as given in paragraph 19 :  (a) To cover &quot; automatic &quot; contingencies (paragraph 20)    ...   2f million.(b) To cover other contingencies (paragraph 21)    ...       ...   6  million.Total        ...       ... Hf million.As explained in paragraph 19, the estimated expenditure for 1930 for the purposes of the Convention was  3S-5 million. The Economy decisions recently approved will, however, result in permanent reductions in the Army amounting to  2,166,000; of this,  6u0,000 savings are allowed for in paragraph 20 above. So that the basis to which the margin of  8*75 million is to be added is  38*5 million
less the subsequent Economy reductions  1,600,000 (i.e.,  2,166,000- 600,000), or  36*9 million. This gives a limitation figure for the British Army of  45*65 million. To the figure for expenditure must be added, as in the case of effectives, the figure in respect of Colonial Forces (see paragraph 11).23. In making this recommendation, the Council have not taken into account any effect that may result from any new financial arrangements with India, the departure from the gold standard and any change in fiscal policy.Limitation Figure for Expenditure on War Materiel.24. A large proportion of the contingencies detailed in paragraphs i0 and 21 above refer to war materiel. These are given below, a figure being given against each to represent the additional annual expenditure required to make a provision which, in the opinion of. the Council, can be regarded as reasonable : Reference to paragraphs 20 and 21.	Contingency.&apos;	Estimated additional annual expenditure on war materiel.20 (a)	&quot;War materiel&quot;  element involved in making up	 	shortage on establishment	75,00020 (6)	Exhaustion of stocks	1,000,00021 (a)	&quot; War materiel &quot; element involved by allowing 14-5		per cent, margin in effectives ...	175,00021 (6)	Singapore	200,00021 (e)	Mechanization	500,00021 (/)	Coast Defence	500,00021 (h)	Anti-aircraft Defences of London	300,000	Miscellaneous	250,000	Total   additional annual expenditure on war		materiel regarded as a reasonable provision		for the above contingencies     ......	3,000,00025. The Council therefore recommend that a margin of  3 million should be allowed over the estimated expenditure on war materiel for 1930 as given in paragraph 19, and that a limitation figure of  7 million should be accepted for expenditure on war materiel. To this must be added the figure in respect of the Colonial Forces.The proviso made in paragraph 23 applies also to this recommendation.Miscellaneous points in connection with Budgetary Expenditure.26. The recommendations of the Committee of Budgetary Experts as to the methods by which expenditure on the armed forces shall be computed and limited raise a number of points on which the Council will express their views in a separate paper. This Memorandum is based on the assumption that the Committee&apos;s recommendations will be accepted without alteration.27. tt has been presumed that the Colonial Office will present figures regarding expenditure on forces administered by Colonial Governments, as well as for personnel (see paragraph 10). Such figures, borh for personnel and expenditure, will require to be co-ordinated with, and, in certain cases, added to the War Office figures.Duration of the Convention.28. The figures of limitation for personnel and expenditure proposed in the preceding paragraphs are based on tbe assumption that the Convention will cover a period of 5 years. In the event of the Convention having a duration of more than 5 years, the Council desire to reseiwe to themselves the right to reconsider these figures.Summary of Recommendations. 29. The Army Council recommend that: (i) We should not accept limitation of the land armed forces stationed overseasprovided for under Table II annexed to Chapter A, Part I, which is optional (paragraph 8).(ii) For limitation of personnel a margin should be allowed over present establish-ments, as given in the Appendix to this Memorandum, equivalent to 14*5 per cent., and that, assuming the methods of calculation herein
adopted, the following figures, so far as the British Army is concerned, should be accepted for insertion in Tables I and III annexed to Chapter A of Part I of the Draft Convention : Table I. Maximum Land Armed Forces stationed in the Home Country.Total. Officers.Average daily effectives...       ...    151,821 9,764Table III. Maximum of the Total Land Armed Forces.Total. Officers.Average daily effectives......    180,882 11,213(paragraphs 14-16)(iii) For limitation of total expenditure on the Army, a margin of  8  million shouldbe allowed over the expenditure as calculated on the basis of the Model . , ,. Statement from 1930 Estimates. (This gives a limitation figure for total expenditure of  4^65 million.) Expressed in terms of Army Estimates, this is equivalent^to an addition of  8  million to Effective Expenditure in 1930 EstimateljM paragraph 22).(iv) For limitation of expenditure on^war materiel for the Army, a margin of  3 million should be allowed over the expenditure as calculated on the basis of the Model Statement from 1930 Estimates. This gives a limitation figure of  7 million (paragraph 25).(v) To the figures in (iii) and (iv) must be added the figures relating to the Colonial Forces.
