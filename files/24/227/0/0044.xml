[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1932.)SECRET.CP. 44 (32). Copy No,CABINET;DISARMAMENT.A Note on the Knock-out Blow.It is always tiresome for a Minister to send in a postscript after the Cabinet baa-discussed a question and arrived at its conclusions. None the less, I venture to take the risk of irritating my colleagues by circulating this note. Let me, however, assure them that I do not ask for a further discussion of the issue that it raises and that J only want them to keep it in mind in view of possible developments at Geneva.The more I think of our recent discussions, the more I feel that we have not attached sufficient importance to possible methods of preventing a knock-out blow in the early days of an aggressive attack. The risk of the knock-out blow loomed very largely in the discussions of the three-party Conference. I think that I first emphasised it ; in any case, I took some pains to illustrate it by the example of air attack. As I see it, the most formidable feature of modern warfare is the vulnerability of great centres of population and industry. War has ceased to be a struggle between armies and navies, and in any future war there will be no-restricted war zone of operations.This being so, it seems to me to be essential to make it as difficult as possible for any aggressor to launch a sudden and devastating attack in the early days of a crisis. This is why I am strongly in favour of the restriction of military bombing aeroplanes. Of course, I know all the arguments about bombers being the only effective instruments of air defence. None the less, I believe that a restriction of bombers,, particularly of bombers of the metropolitan air forces, that is to say, air forces within the reach of the great capitals of Europe, would be a practical step towards making a knock-out blow less likely to succeed.Similarly, I believe that the abolition of the big gun and the big tank in land55&quot; armaments would have the same effect. If I am right in the conclusion that I draw from the history of the war, it would appear that the development of the machine-gun made the attack of entrenched positions almost hopeless unless the attacking forces wrere well supplied with heavy artillery, large tanks and bombing aircraft. Of bombing aircraft I have already spoken. As to heavy artillery and the bigger tanks,, would not their restriction or abolition greatly increase the defensive power of armies and fortifications ?   If this is so, I suggest that a great gain is achieved.The less likely an aggressor is to succeed in his first attack, the less likely he is to-make it. If the knock-out blow is unlikely to come off, an unscrupulous Power will not be inclined to try it. If there is no attempt at a kuock-out blow, processes of war then revert to the slower procedure of the pre-tank and pre-aeroplane period. The forces of peace have an opportunity for consolidation. The methods of conciliation and arbitration can be attempted. The public opinion of the &quot;world has an opportunity for making itself felt. The value of this moratorium 1 place even higher than the value of any decision that may actually be made as a result of arbitration or conciliation. Moreover, as I see the mobility and the swiftness of instruments of destruction constantly increasing, I feel that it is one of the essential factors in the problem of disarmament upon which we should insist. It is the more necessary to-keep it in mind at the present moment. I do not myself believe that any eompre-hensive Convention is likely to result from the Geneva Conference during the next 12 mouths.   If this opinion is correct, it is the more important to try to obtain someif&quot; I know tlio difficulty about distinguishing between the big gun on land and the big gun on sea, and L also realise the fact that there is no hard-and-fast line between a big tank and a small tank. None tho less 1 believe that if biguns were restricted to the small number required for big ships, the danger of their sudden transfer to land emplacements would not be formidable. As to tanks, I would try to abolish the big battering-ram type of tank that smashes a defensivo position and allow countries to develop the small armoured-car type of tank that is useful for police and protection. 659       go   1.32
practical result that, though it may only touch a part of the big problem, will yet show the world that we mean business. When, therefore, the interminable second reading speeches proceed to take their course, and when, in a few months&apos; time, the only apparent result of the Conference will have been to make every country demand more effectives and a higher expenditure than is at present the case, when the most conspicuous feature will have been to force Germany and the conquered countries to insist upon rearmament in a Disarmament Conference, when, in fact, everybody is at, sixes and sevens and nothing looks like emerging, I greatly hope that we shall concentrate our attention upon such urgent issues as an Air Agreement between Great Britain, France and Italy, and particularly upon the possibilities of making the knock-out blow more difficult than it is at present.S.
