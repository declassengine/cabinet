COPY NO.SECRET.CP.  29  (53)CABINET.INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 16th January, 1952.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet hy the Secretary of State for India.
9 9 -j o&apos;   j.Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated loth January,1952, issued on &quot;the aathority j^iL-the Se c r e t ar y of State for indian the last appreciation, it was observed that it was difficult to see what course Congress could take which would not bring them into direct conflict with the Government within a very few weeks, not merely in particular Provinces, but generally.     This apprehension has unfortunately been fulfilled, and there is now in force a general civil disobedience movement.      The events which led up to this have been described in statements issued by United Provinces Government and Chief Commissioner of the North West Frontier Province, and, more generally, in statement issued by Government of India on 4th January.     It is therefore unnecessary to explain them at length and attention is confined to dominant factors.     These were no-rent campaign in the United Provinces, Red Shirt activities in the North West Frontier Province, and a predominant war party in Congress.      The chances of peace were very gravely prejudiced when Jawahar Lai and his friends decided on a no-rent campaign in the United Provinces.      They started this while discussions were going on with the local Government and their action made it impossible to carry on further conversations.     Their demands, in any case, were of such an extravagant character as to make it clear that they wished to force an isaue.     While Gandhi may not have fully realised the consequences of the events in the United Provinces he cannot be completely absolved from the responsibility in regard to them.      About the middle of Ootober, Jawahar Lai cabled to him that meeting of cultivatorswa 3/
Q 9 9tj! (v- 2 -was to be called to decide question of non-payment of rent.Gandhi cabled back that Jawahar Lai should take the necessary steps to meat the situation.      It should have been obvious to him that, if once a campaign were launched, question of co-operation in constitutional discussions would be v6ry gravely prejudiced.      In the meantime, events on the frontier came to a head.      In the last appreciation it was mentioned that the Chief Commissioner was very doubtful whether he could hold his hand much longer and that any day he might have to ask for special measures.     Every effort was made to avoid the crisis,  or,  at any rate, delay it until after Gandhi&apos;s arrival in India and the Chief Commissioner waited until the situation was such that he could wait no longer, consistent with the safety of his province and of the frontier.      Abdul Ghaffar&apos;s activities became more intense.     He and his followers contemptuously rejected Prime minister&apos;s statement, deliberately refused to oo-cperate, clamoured for renewal of the civil disobedience, and planned demonstrations which would, if carried out, have added greatly to the excitement which was already high.      In these circumstances, Chief Commissioner had no alternative hut to ask for permission to strike at the Red Shirt Movement and at the Congress organisation In the Province, which was behind that movement.      There was equally no alternative to the Government of India but to give the necessary permission, although it was fully realised that the action would make a general revival of civil disobedience almost inevitable.At/
At the same time Sub-has Boss was clamouring for boycott of British goods in Bengal and, generally, a definite strengthening of the war mentality was evident in other provinces.When Gandhi landed in Bombay members of the Working Committee were practically unanimously in &apos; favour of the resumption of civil disobedience.      Gandhi himself would have preferred to temporise and it is not improbable that, if his lieutenants had not irretrievably committed him, he would have liked to co-operate within limits to be defined by himself in further constitutional discussions.      Behind this co-operation there would, however, have been continuous threat of civil disobedience and Gandhi would almost certainly have attempted to use the constitutional stags as a means of re-establishing his damaged prestige.     ho had difficulty from the first in handling the Working Committee, but hs persuaded them to agree to his first telegram of 29th December to the Viceroy, in which he referred to events of the frontier and the United Provinces and to Bengal Ordinance, and asked whether he was to take these as an indication of closure of friendly relations, or whether the Viceroy wished to see him.     The reply of the Viceroy made it clear that an interview was possible only if the assumption could be made that Gandhi did not associate himself with Congress activity in the two former provinces, and that, in any case, Viceroy was not prepared to discuss measures taken there or in Bengal.     The reply to this was an ultimatum which, und9r threat of civil disobedience, demanded Government should take certain action which Congress of course realised they could not possibly/
9 9possibly take.Criticism of the course taken by the Viceroy and Government of India has concentrated on the fact that the Viceroy did not give Gandhi an unconditional interview.     It may be observed that while this criticism has generally been expressed by Congress supporters and also by some representatives of other schools ox thought, there has been a large measure of support in India for the course actually taken, and there is little doubt that the public generally realise the importance of the issues involved.     In the first place, it was not possible to treat Gandhi as an individual.     He went to, and returned from, England as representative of Congress and had he seen the Viceroy he must have spoken on behalf of Congress. Co-operation by Gandhi was utterly inconsistent with non-co-operation by Congress and co-operation of Congress was clearly incompatible, not only with events in the United Provinces and the North West Frontier Province, but also with war preparations elsewhere.     The simple issues, therefore, were xvhether Congress were willing to oo-operate by abandonment of these activities and, if not, was Gandhi prepared to dissociate himself from them?     Answer to the second question was a foregone conclusion.     An answer to the first was necessary before theViceroy could see Gandhi. This is obvious from an examination of the position in the three provinces mentioned by Gandhi in his first telegram. In Bengal, Local Government were engaged in a fight with the terrorist movement in which there were, and are still, no clear indications that the tide has turned in favour of the Government.In/
o o rr u ij \jIn the United Provinces the provincial Congress organisation had given permission to all district committees to extend the campaign if they considered conditions favourable.     The action taken by the Local Government had checked the movement but the danger was still serious.     As soon as the campaign was launched. Local Government, with the approval of the Government of India, had refused to discuss the question of rent remissions with Congress representatives.     This fact alone made it impossible for the Viceroy to discuss the matter with Gandhi over the head of the Local Government. On the frontier, comprehensive action had been taken five -days before by the Chief Commissioner, and although unexpected success had attended his operations the situation was critical and he had in front of him a very difficult sad strenuous task in obtaining control over Congress and the Red-Shirt movement and in securing support and the confidence of loyalists.     Thus, unless it was made clear beyond any question of doubt,  firstly, that Gandhi dissociated himself from Congress activities in this province, and secondly, that the Viceroy was not prepared to discuss the measures taken to meet them,  difficulties of all three Local Governments would have been greatly increased at a most critical time.     As in the past, Congress would have exploited the personal position of Gandhi and, quite irrespective of the intention of Government not to modify measures they had thought necessary, a feeling of insecurity and uncertainty would have been created at a time when the situation imperatively demanded that there should be no uncertainty.     There was, in short, no escaping from thefact/-
9 o f*fact that GandhiTs lieutenants had placed him in position from which the Government could not extricate him, nor he himself escape, unless he were prepared to throw the lieutenants overboard.Once the issues had been decided, the Government of India and all the Local Governments -took strong and immediate action.      Gandhi and other leaders were quickly-arrested.     Drastic powers were taken to deal with the situation and a direct attack was made on Congress organisations.     At the same time the public were assured of the protection of the Government in the carrying out of their lawful business.The first results of the action taken have been good, and have exceeded expectations.     There have been no serious clashes between the police and the public, and the latter generally have taken the events of the past ten days with surprising calmness.     Arrests of prominent leaders, which in 1930 were often the cause of trouble, have produced slight reactionsi     Except in Bombay City there have been few organised attempts to initiate a civil disobedience programme on a considerable scale, and,  so far, there have been few signs of trouble from rural areas.      It is, however, very necessary not to underestimate the elements of trouble, or to assume that the movement is broken.     Government have started with certain advantages but there are unstable factors and all that can he attempted at present is an appreciation of the various forces now at work.It will probably prove of definite value that both in the United Provinces and the North-West Frontier Province, Congress forced the issue in advance of the general revival ofthe /
the civil disobedience movement.     In the former, Local Government were able to secure a large measure of control before Congress could embark on a widespread campaign, and, except in one district, rents are reported to be coming&apos; in satisfactorily.     Moreover, the no-rent movement has alienated many who might have supported the civil disobedience if it had excluded this feature.     In the North West Frontier Province, Local Government took the Red-Shirt and Congress organisations completely by surprise and were able to strike &apos; a very hard blow at them before they could recover.     They were still suffering from this blow when civil disobedience was revived and in consequence local reaction was small.Again, large sections of the public have been grsatiy impressed by the determination of the Government to deal firmly with the movement.      This has definitely discouraged lukewarm adherents and has encouraged others to come out on the side of the Government, although the latter movement is not yet well defined.     Again, Congress have probably over-estimated both the keenness and preparedness cf the country for civil disobedience.      They have failed to realise that the public as a whole are tired of agitation and strife; that many of the trading classes are exasperated by the continuous interference with their business;    that many of those who take an interest in political matters can see no advantage in the present movement, and definite gain in bringing to completion constitutional scheme as defined by the Prime Minister.Moreover, economic conditions are better than they were a few months ago and there has been a distinct tendency towards a rise in the price of agricultural produce.     all this/
9 0 0sj h 0this is to the good.     On the other hand Congress organisation is a very powerful one, and, even among those who disapprove of civil disobedience, there is considerable sympathy with its other activities.      It is too early yet to judge how far its agents will succeed in penetrating the villages.     They will doubtless make strenuous efforts to do so and results will net be apparent for several weeks.     Although, with a few exceptions, there is a lack of excitement in the towns, this is apt to grow rapidly if regrettable incidents occur.     Congress relies on clashes with the authorities as their best means of propaganda and a few serious riots might easily affect the situation.Again, the Muslim situation is not assured.     The vast majority of Muslims are pleased that the Government are showing a very strong hand against Congress but some are perturbed by the action against Muslims   in the Forth West Frontier province and by the Kashmir trouble.     Very-exaggerated accounts have gained currency as to the events on the frontier, and,  although every effort Is made to counter these, they tend to unsteady Muhammadan feeling -This in any case is affected by the large number of arrests it has been necessary to make, and, although at present there is no serious cause for anxiety, position may change if operations have to continue there on a considerable scale.     Fortunately there are indications that this will not be necessary.     The Ahrar agitation regarding Kashmir is fizzling out but it might quickly revive if there were further trouble in that State and the Purbar is faced in one tahsil with a strong movement against payment of revenue&apos;which may at any time lead to clashesbetween/
between the authorities and the people.Quite apart from Militant activities of Congress must be reckoned what may be called silent boycotting, this is based largely on sentiment, and partly on coercion exercised through social pressure.      it is practically impossible to deal effectively with it for no measure by Government can make the people buy particular goods if they do not wish to do so.      In this direction movement is bound to attain considerable success even when allowance is made for the fact that protection of traders by the Government will lead to increased purchases of British goods by some classes.     It appears probable that Congress will rely more on sentimental than on militant-factors.      They are certainly concentrating on the financial side and one  of their chief items is to inflict the maximum of financial loss,   (a) on the British Government^(b) on the Government of India and Local Government-s, and,(c) on British concerns and individuals.The centre of the movement is Bombay City where sentimant and self-interest are powerful influences.      It is too early yet to say whether action such as checking export of gold, withdrawing custom from British Banks and insurance companies will have much effect or whether effect will be sustained.A very satisfactory feature of the situation has been the acceptance, with two exceptions, of the invitations to serve on constitutional oommittees.     This is Indicative, firstly, of a widespread belief that the Government are sincere in their intentions to push on reforms as rapidly as possible, and, secondly, of the feeling that the good of the country lies in co-operation and not in oivildisobedience/
9 9disobedience.     There is a very definite change in this respect from 1250-     Here again,  importance rightly attached to constitutional questions is not without difficulties, for the Muslims find, it difficult to co-operate whole-heartedly with the Government in fighting the civil disobedience movement until they are completely satisfied regarding their position in the new constitut ion.On the whole, there is good reason for congratulation on the results of the first round of the fight, but there is insufficient ground for optimistic assumptions regarding its duration or strength of the other side.     There is absolutely no justification for the relaxation of pressure in any direction.
