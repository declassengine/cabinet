aocument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government.CABINET,NATIONALITY OF MARRIED WOMEN. 5(32) ______Memorandum by the Home SecretaryCOPY No1, It will be necessary for a decision to be reached in thenear future as to the course to be taken on this matter.    The Canadian Parliament has passed certain legislation which had been suspended only temporarilyj    it has now been decided to bring it into operation on the 15th January,  1932,  and unless the Imperial Parliament as well as the other Parliaments of the Commonwealth also legislate, there will be a breach in the uniformity of the law of nationality throughout the Empire which it is important, if possible,  to maintain.2, There has been for many years a growing agitation by various women&apos;s organisations in favour of the  application of the principle of the equality of the sexes to nationality. Briefly, they desire that the law should he changed  (1)  so as to allow a British woman who marries a foreigner to retain her nationality if she so wishes;   (2) so as not to confer automatically British nationality on a foreign woman who marries a British subject;  and  (3) so as to enable a married woman to change her nationality by naturalisation in the same way as a. man. The subject was discussed at the Imperial Conferences of 1923 and 1926, but it was not found possible to reach any agreement.    In March, 1929, Mr. Ramsay FacDonald,  in reply to a women&apos;s deputation, declared himself in favour of their proposals.    In 1930 the Conference on the Codification of International Lew met at the Hague5  end the United Kingdom representetive stated, on the instructions of the Labour Government, that that Government was in complete sympathy with the women&apos;s demands.    It was not, however, found possible to secure general agreement for these proposals, and modified provisions were inserted as Articles 3 to 10 of a Convention on Nationality,    This Convention was
lllllll un h i .............iihiiimiiiiiimiiiiihiiiiiimmmiwiinilllllhiiiiiiiiiiii- 2 -signed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the UnitedKingdom and in Canada, Australia,  India;  Irish Free State, endSouth Africa.    Those provisions were as followsArticle 8.      If the national law of the wife causes her to lose&quot;&quot;her nationality on marriage with a foreigner, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring the nationality of the husband.Article 9.    If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a change in the nationality of her husband occurring during marriage,  this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring her husband&apos;s new nationality.Article 10. Naturalisation of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife&quot; except with her consent.Sufficient ratifications of the Hague Convention have not yet been deposited to bring the Convention into force;  and no member of the British Commonwealth has yet ratified.The matter was further discussed at the Imperial Conference, 1930, but it was again found impossible to secure any agreement beyond the Hague proposals.    The Conference placed on record in its Rep statement that it was assumed that those members ofthe Commonwealth who had signed the Convention would Introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to Articles 8 to 10. 3, The women1s organisations have expressed strongdissatisfaction with the Articles of the Hague Convention on the ground that not only do they not go far enough to meet their demands, but actually stereotype the existing position of inequality of the sexes in the sphere of nationality.    They have urged His Majesty&apos;s Government not to ratify the Convention,  and they are bringing pressure to bear on the Government to give legislative effect to their full demands.    On the other hand any differentiation between the nationality of husband and wife necessarily raises difficulties including those relating to passports,4. The position in the several Dominions is as fallows:Canada:      The problem there is acute because Canadian women frequently marry United States citizens and,  as the result of
- 3 -such a marriage,  a Canadian woman under the existing la?&apos; ceases to he a British subject and becomes stateless,  since she does not under the American law automatically acquire the nationality of her husband.    Consequently the Canadian Parliament,  in pursuance of the agreement reached at the Imperial Conference, 1930, has already passed legislation to give effect to the Articles of the Hague Convention; hut, at the request of the United Kingdom Government, had hitherto delayed bringing this legislation into force until the remaining parts of the Empire would have had time to take action.   As I have already stated, this legislation is now being brought into operation.    The Canadian representative at the last Assembly of the League intimated in private conversation that, while the Canadian Government regarded this legislation as urgently necessary to meet the practical difficulty  (namely,  the position of Canadian women married to United States citizens),  they were not,  so far as he knew, likely to wish to go further at present on the grounds that there was no general demand for further changes in the direction of theoretical equality, while any such changes would probably he  strongly resisted by the large Catholic population in Quebec and elsewhere.Commonwealth of Australia;    The representative of the Commonwealth at the last Assembly indicated that the Commonwealth Government were in favour of equality in principle,  so long as it were agreed to by other Governments,  especially the Government of the United Kingdom.New Zealand:    In the past, New Zealand has taken a similar view to the Commonwealth, but at the time of the Assembly the Hew Zealand representative indicated that the New Zealand Government would probably not wish to go further than Article 8 of the Hague Convention.Union of South Africa:    At the time of the Assembly the Union Government sent definite instructions to their representative that, in view of the practical difficulties and the absence of any real
need for a change in the Union, they were not prepared to go beyond Articles 8-10 of the Hague Convention.      (Although the Union Government did not refer to the point,  it is probable that thdr position is largely based on religious considerations, namely, the attitude of the Dutch Cslvinistic Church).Irish Free State;    The Irish Free State Government have consistently made it clear that they are not prepared to go beyond Articles 8-10 of the Hague Convention.    This attitude Is undoubtedly based upon that of the Roman Catholic Church.5. The law relating to British nationality is now the samethroughout the Empire.    It was put on a statutory basis by the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act,  1914, which was passed after consultation with all the then existing Dominions, and corresponding enactments have been passed by the Dominion legislatures.    The principle of the existing law, in so far as it affects married women,  is that the national status of the husband governs that of his wife.    Upon this uniformity in the nationality law of the Commonwealth depends the common Empire-wide status of all those who as British subjects owe common allegiance to the Crown.As to the practice in other countries,  I attach a note which shows the present position.    It will be observed that the law in the United States and in a number of countries of the second rank, is now in substantial conformity with the proposals that are urged by the women&apos;s organisations, but not the lew of the principal European countries  (except Russia).7. Canada having now decided not to postpone any longer the effective operation of the legislation her Parliament had already passed, the courses open to us are these  :-(a)    To legislate, as Canada has done, on the lines of Articles 8 to 10 of the Hague Cenvention,  in anticipation that the rest of the Dominions will do
likewise.   The Bill would provide that the Act would not come into force until they had so acted.(b) To endeavour to persuade Canada, South Africa and the Irish Free State to agree to the proposals of the women&apos;s organisations.(c) To introduce a Bill giving effect to the women1 s proposals, hut suspending them until the Dominions had legislated similarly; meanwhile to enact the Hague Articles.(d) To legislate in accordance with those proposals, and to accept a Preach in the principle of uniformity, with different laws on this point in the United Kingdom and perhaps Australia and New Zealand on the one hand, and in the remaining three Dominions on the other.(e) To do nothing, which would again involve acquiescence in a Preach of uniformity.Alternative  (a) would he bitterly resented by most of the principal women1s organisations in the country.There is little prospect of (b) being successful.(o) would be regarded as procrastination for an indefinite period.The objections to  (d) are obvious;  among others it would furnish a precedent for independent legislation by any Dominion, which might involve still more serious breaches of the principle of uniformity.(e) would be a failure to implement our under-takings at the last Imperial Conferences.I ask the Cabinet to decide which of the evils is theleast8. In the event of (a) or (c) being chosen, it mightbe possible to legislate at the same time so as to remove the legal disabilities - Ineligibility for the franchise,
HOME OFFICE:25th January,  1932liability to registration as an alien, etc. - under which a British born woman, married to an alien,  is now placed. But this would be far from satisfying the advocates of the wider reform.9. There are various other proposals for the amendmentof the law of British nationality which are overdue for legislation;  some of them have been outstanding for several years.    They are provisions  for which the agreement of the Bominlons has been secured.    They are mainly of a technical or drafting character, but several not unimportant proposals are included; e.g. a proposal, agreed to at the Imperial Conference, 1926, that power should be taken to provide for naturalisation on the basis of residence in protectorates and mandated territories.   A further proposal is that provision should be made to enable children of the third generation of British parents born abroad during the late war to acquire British nationality by the prooess of registration with the British Consul or representative in the country where they  are living.    Both of these proposals have  already been incorporated in a. Bill,  in the terms of which all the members of the British Commonwealth concur.There are certain other proposals of a technical character on which we are at present in consultation with the Dominions and which should, with their concurrence, be Included in any Bill.H.S.
