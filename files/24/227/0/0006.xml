Memorandum by the Home Secretary.At a recent meeting of the Cabinet, trie Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that I should circulate a memorandum on this subject.      Since then (on December 14th) the American Ambassador has told the Foreign Secretary that the Mexican Government were thinking of proposing an International Conference on Silver.      They had intimated to Mr. Stimson that if the attendance of the principal countries,  particularly the United States and Great Britain,   could be secured, they would probabl37&quot; issue invitations to such a Conference to be held in Mexico City this wintea.      General Dawes enquired what would he the response of the British Government if sucli an invitation were issued. He said that &quot;the United States thought such a Conference would be desirable,  and hoped that no obstacle to acceptance would be raised by this country.&quot;Great Britain has a threefold interest in securing, if it be possible, a stabilised price for silver, at a level higher than the present .1. By far the most important consideration relates tothe China trade.      It is vital to this  country,  if it is to maintain its present population, that the overseas markets for the products of our industries should be restored and expanded. China, with a quarter of the population of the earth,  is the chief market offering possibilities for our trade that remains undeveloped.      But so far from increasing, our exports to China, have shrunk during the last ten years,  both absolutely and in relation to the exports from several of our competitors.     The shrinkage, however, is not uniform, and some industries have held.their/
their own.     For the unfavourable trend of British trade thereare a variety of causes, some arising in China itself,  somearising out of the conditions of British production andmerchanting,  some world-wide.      In China alone among theprincipal countries of the world,  silver remains the basis of currency, and among the causes that have contributed to thedecline and prevented the expansion of British trade with china is the catastrophic fall in the value of silver.Every aspect of this trade was exhausitvely consideredby the Economic Mission which was sent to the Ear East inSeptember, 1930, and which presented a unanimous report in March,1931.      The relevant paragraphs in the Conclusions of the report are as follows  :-&quot;The continued depreciation of the value of silver &quot;has enormously reduced the purchasing power of China, and &quot;if it continues will hasten the growth of industries in &quot;China,   the manufactures of v/hi ch will compete with imported &quot;products from Great Britain.      Reduction in the value of &quot;silver also increases the difficulties of China in meeting &quot;interest on foreign loans, and so compels her to raise &quot;further revenue by increasing import duties.      If the &quot;depreciation of silver were to affect the foreign loan &quot;service, much damage would be inflicted on British interests.&quot;In our opinion,  every means should be sought of bringing &quot;about the stabilisation of silver and so of restoring to &quot;China her full purchasing- power.      Only by international &quot;agreement can this result be attained,  and we feel that &quot;Great Britain should take a leading part in endeavouring to &quot;secure such agreement.&quot;In a recent article, Mr. E. I. Gull,  the Secretary ofthe China Association,  says :-13&quot;Clearly, when the tael is worth 2s7Tq^    (as the &quot;Shanghai tael was on November 20, 1928) he (the Chinese &quot;purchaser) will have to give fewer taels  (or dollars) for a &quot;commodity costing,  say,  10 than when the tael is, worth. &quot;13.7-5-d., as it was on November 20, 1930,  or ls.10i5.cl, whi-ch &quot;was the Shanghai exchange rate on November 16 la sir.    &quot;&quot;British exports to China, being in the main manufactures &quot;(many of them relatively high-priced fine quality goods) are &quot;extremely sensitive to exchange fluctuations.&quot;A fall in the value of silver rapidly narrows the market &quot;for them,  to the disadvantage not only of our own rnanufact-&quot;manufacturers,  but also of Chinese traders and consumers, whose &quot;normal requirements have had perforce to remain unsatisfied, &quot;except in so far as they could be met from domestic sources.&quot;&quot;These various considerations involve one point aboutwhi ch/
&quot;which there will be no dispute;    namely,  that a more stable &quot;ra,te of exchange between gold and silver would be extremely &quot;advantageous to China&apos;s foreign trade.      Constant &quot;fluctuations in the rate are extremely upsetting to &quot;importers and exporters alike.&quot;In fact, it is not too much to say that as long as &quot;these fluctuations have to be  contended with,  China will &quot;never pull her weight in international trade.&quot;It is no answer to these  contentions to say that the silver factor is only one element in the Chinese tra,de situation among many.      The fact remains that it certainly is one element, and by no means unimportant.And it is no sufficient answer to say that because Chinese exports are paid for in the main on gold values,  the payment in silver money for imports does not matter, because the imports will in the long run be paid for by the exports. Economic theory could give an answer to that;    but more important is the fact that all the British traders who have dealings with China are,convinced, from their daily practical experience,  that the fall in the price of silver does matter very greatly.I submit that the Government ought not to ignore the emphatic and unanimous opinion of the very competent Economic Mission which teas sent to the East on purpose to study this question among others.2. A second British interest in silver arises from thefact that the metal furnishes for the masses of the populationof India one of the customary methods  of saving.      When thenormal money value of all their silver ornaments and hoards(other than in coin) is suddenly halved,  the moral and political effect must be serious.      In a recent article in the PoliticalScience Quarterly,.Sir Arthur Salter writes :-&quot;An Indian peasant, for example, has saved a given &quot;amount of silver.      He has been accustomed in the past,  in &quot;hard times,  to bring out that block of silver and to get &quot;a perfectly definite number of rupees for it, but the rupee, &quot;although looking like silver,  is now a. gold standard coin. &quot;The Indian peasant therefore finds,  for reasons which he &quot;ca,not understand but which,  in the absence of a very &quot;elaborate economic explain.na.tion,  he not unnaturally ascribesto/
&quot;to the malice of the Government of India,  that he gets only &quot;half as many rupees.      And it is  in rupees that he has to &quot;purchase not only the relatively small proportion of goods &quot;which he wants from abroad but things produced in India itself.&quot;It may be that this is one among tho many economic causesthat, underlie Indian political discontent.&apos;6 . The  third British interest arises from the fact that  theIndian Treasury has an immense surplus stock of rupees which it is wai t i ng to sell.Immediately after tho war,  when the prices of commodities were very high in India as elsewhere,  there was -a largely increased demand for currency for the purposes of ordinary trs.de.     The United States Treasury had a. large stock of silver dollars, which had been -accumulated over a long series  of years in the vain attempt, undertaken for political reasons,  to keep up the price of silver by State purchases.      The United States in 1918-19 sold 197 million ozs.  of this silver, at a dollar an oz.,   to India,  where it was minted and put into  circulation.      In 1917-20 the mints at Calcutta and Bombay struck and issued over a thousand million whole rupees, apart from smaller silver coins.The subsequent fall in prices hag. had a reverse effect, and the Government of India has had thrown upon its hands considerably more than 500 million ozs.  of silver.      Of this  it has managed to sell so far about 100 million ozs.      It still holds about 415 million ozs.   (at present worth some  35,000,000),  of which it would be glad to sell a half, retaining the remainder as reserve. The lower the price of silver falls  the more difficult it is to get rid of this incubus and the heavier the loss that would be incurred.      The- Government of India would welcome therefore any measures which,  other things remaining equal, would tend to restore the value of silver and render it stable.The facts as to the price of silver may be very brieflys tated.In/
In the middle of the 19th century the price per fine oz. was fairly stable at 64d. to 67d. gold.      After 1873 various causes  led to a decline, and just before the war the price was about 27d.      In 1919 it rose to a peak figure of 56d. and fell in 1930 to an average of 19*ld., the lowest figure actually reached being 12d.  on 9th February, 1931.      It was on December 30th,  1931, 20d.  sterling or 14d. gold.The primary causes of the fall in recent years have no doubt been the same as those which have brought about the world-wide fall in the prices of commodities generally.      But silver,  at its lowest point, had fallen much more than the average of other commodities, and is still at a much lower level.The following is a table showing the general fall in the index number of commodity prices since pre-war, and the comparative figure for silver (a)  in 1913,   (b) at the date when silver was at its lowest,   (c)  at the most redent date for which figures are available  :-1913 .1925 .1926 .1927 .1928 .1929 .1930 .February 1931 .November 1931 .Board of Trade Index No. of Wholesale Prices100.159.1148.1141 A140.3136.5119.5106.2106. it December 1931  ...X   Lowest 12d.  on 9.2.1931.Price of silver pence per oz._27 .57 32.10 28.69 26.03 26.75 24.46 17.67 12.43 X15.30 gold (sterling 19.39)14.00 gold (sterling 20d. )The accentuation in the fall in the price of silver is not due to any increase in the production of new silver. Between 1923 and 1930 production has been fairly steady at between 260 and 240 million ozs. a year.      It has been mainly due to the fact that the supplies  to the market have been swollen-or/
or may at any time be swollen by sales by various Governments.We ourselves reduced the content of our silver coinsby nearly one half, and sold about 90 million ozs. of silver between 1920 and1929.      Similarly France disposed of 60 million ozs. out of hercurrency;    other European countries together about an equalamount;    and, in 1929 and 1930,  French Indo-China sold some 40million ozs.      I have already mentioned the sale by the indian government of 100 million ozs.       But more important is the factthat it is knotm that India still has 200 million ozs. waiting tobe sold, not far short of the whole annual production of the worldat the present time.      Since no one knows when portions of these supplies may be released by the Indian Government for sale,  it isimpossible for the market to adapt prices to what would be a normal level on the basis of ordinary demand and supply. -    Theeffect is much the same as the effect upon wheat prices of the accumulated wheat stocks of the Federal Farm Board., a constantfactor weakening the markets.The situation has been well summarised in a memorandumby Mr. Joseph Kitchin,  the best-known authority on statistics inregard to gold and silver:   He says  :-&quot;The drop in the price since 192fl has certainly not been &quot;due to any lessening of the demand of China or (for private &quot;account) of India.,  or of the industrial arts, or to any &quot;change in the rate of production of new silver.      It was &quot;fairly clearly due to the same causes as have reduced &quot;commodity prices generally,  accentuated by the extra supplies &quot;from de-monetised or redundant silver thrown on the market, &quot;coupled with the vista of continued sales by the Indian &quot;Government and threats of further de-monetisation.&quot;To deal with the general position of silver,  a number of schemes have been proposed from various quarter^.     All the more ambitious must unfortunately be rejected,  I regret to think, as unacceptable.      They are -(l)    Bi-metallism.(2)    Symmetallism (the establishment of a metallic standard of value consisting of gold and silver in certain proportions.)
(3)    Restoration of the silver content of British and other currencies.(4)    A large loan to China in the form of silver bullion.I will not stay to discuss the pros and cons of these proposals for there is an overwhelming loody of opinion, with which I find myself in agreement,  that in each case the cons clearly outweigh the pros,Nor is it reasonable to expect that the Government of India should give a pledge, as has been suggested,  that it will keep its stocks off the market, while mining companies are to be free  to maintain or to increase their production.      India is fully entitled to supply the normal demands for silver out of the surplus stocks in the possession of her Government.     Her right to sell this old silver is not merely equal to, it is greater than,  the right of the mining companies to produce new silver to add to the world&apos;s available stocks, which are already excessive.     And the Indian Government has,  very naturally,  found it unsafe to give an alternative undertaking that has been suggested - not to sell any of its silver until the market price reaches a certain level.      So long as new production is unrestricted,   this step might be ineffective for the purpose in view;    and in that event India would be burdened with her surplus stock in perpetuity, or for as long as the pledge held good..There remains one other proposal, and it is to this that I would invite special attention.     It is that a consortium should be formed of representatives of the principal silver producing interests and of the Governments holding stocks, and that this bod?/ should take steps to safeguard present silver prices against a further relapse, gradually to raise them to a level which shall be regarded as fair as between the various interests concerned, and to stabilise them at that level:.It is often assumed that any such plan is impracticablebecause/
because about two-thirds of the production of silver is frommines which are chiefly worked for the extraction of copper,  lead or zinc, and is therefore to a large extent a by-product.      There is expert opinion, however, which holds that this objection is not  conclusive.      Nor are the producers so numerous that any common action must be regarded as impracticable from the outset. It appears that the greater part of the world1s production is in a small number of hands.The proposal for a consortium has been put forward by a Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce.      The Chamber had been giving attention to the silver question, and last September a Committee was appointed to examine it,  consisting of three experts,  one specially familiar with the British aspect of the matter,  one with the American and one with the Chinese. Their report was published last November.      It is advisable that I should quote in full the relevant paragraphs which are as follows :-&quot;Your Committee therefore considers that the rehabilitation of silver should be reviewed by us independently of any ulterior concerted international action,  and only in so far as  remedial measures can be devised which can be  carried into effect within a reasonable time.     We consider that the best results in this direction may be achieved by friendly . co-operation and careful observation of prices, with a view T; -   to establishing a somewhat higher,  although not too high,level,   compatible with the interests of sellers and buyers as well as of holders.      In this respect we think it should be borne in mind that both the production and the absorption of silver are largely inelastic,  so that only such excess production and/or under-consumption as may temporarily exist require to be considered.     As regards excess production it should be remembered that about $5 per cent,  of the world output of silver is a by-product of ores chiefly valuable for copper,  lead and zinc;    this silver will be produced and will be inevitably put on the market.      Apparently the new fields which are open to the exploitation of these ores do not promise any considerable by-production of siJhver.      The reduction in consumption on the other hand has been created by the increasing disuse of silver for monetary purposes,  but the use for the industrial arts continues, much as before. And, finally, it should be remembered that whilst the production and offering of silver on the market are fairly constant,   the demand is erratic and unreliable at all times, and violent fluctuations are caused thereby.It can hardly be&quot; disputed that the wide and. constant fluctuations in the price of silver are a serious obstacle to international trade as a whole- and that s, rise is much to be desired/
I 1 7II idesired.      The country which, is most concerned with the course of silver prices is naturally China.      China has suffered much of recent years, but we do not believe that the fall in silver has been more than a contributory cause.     Indeed China is the one country where prices in daily life have varied least.      It is true that the Chinese farmer has not always been a.ble to sell his produce for export at such higher prices in silver as would compensate the higher prices in silver which must be charged for imported goods on account of the lower rates of exchange.      Rural China is essentially still a self-supporting community which, with few exceptions,  can dispense with imported goods if necessary.There can be no doubt, however,  that a relative stability of the silver price would materially contribute :tor/ards a gradual opening of the interior of China to trade.     ITotwith-standing the desire of the Chinese Government to put the currency of the country upon a gold basis,  it can hardly be questioned that, for ma,ny years to come, silver will rfmain the principal basis of monetary circulation in China.We believe that at the moment China could bear a moderate and gradual rise in the gold value of its currency but not a heavy or rapid one.     So far as India is concerned, apart from the interest of the Government with its vast stock of silver rupees, a sudden and violent rise in the price of silver could only check its absorption by the population of that countrjr.Of the total annual production of silver,  estimated for this year at less than 200,000,000 ozs., the larger proportion is at present controlled by a few corporations in America, who, if they have a. working agreement with the Indian Treasury, giving all participants a reasonable quota of world sales, should be capable of keeping silver at a, price fair to both buyers and sellers so long as they supply the market with j udgment.It is not generally realised that at the present price the value of a year&apos;s production of silver is only about ^56,000,000,000.The annual demand, for silver includes a/bout 50,000,000,000 ozs. for industrial consumption.     We may take it that this would be bought almost irrespective of price.      There remain.-, therefore,  the Indian and the China demands.      The former has remained steady for the last three years and does not depend entirely on the price.The difficulty is with China,  but if due attention is pa.id to the position in that country, this difficulty should not be unsurmountable.      It must be repeated that a rise in the price of silver means a rise in the China exchange and that any material rise would tend to diminish the exports and increase the imports of that country,  other things being equal. Although this would be of undoubted benefit to exporters to China,  it remains to be seen to what extent the increased imports would consist of silver.    A regular supply at a reasonable price might contribute to the maintenance of the demand for silver.      Therefore a too sudden or too large a rise in the price should be avoided and it would also be a grave error to decide beforehand what price should be aimed at.Your Committee accordingly recommends that if the International Chamber of Commerce wishes to retain the subject of silver on its agenda,  it should investigate thepossibilities/
possibilities of bringing trie North American producers and refiners of silver into a sale agreement with the Government of India.   For this purpose of course the producers of the United States, in order to conform to their national laws, could only he organised from the point of view of export sales. Other producers of any substantial quantity should naturally be welcomed into the agreement, whilst the importance of bringing the Bank of Spssin and kindred institutions into these deliberations should not be lost sight of.A selling agreement which does not include the Indian Government would not be practicable and to expect that Government to agree not to sell except at a price materially higher than that fixed for the producers would be unjust and futile.      The several parties must work together and it would naturally be provided that any participant can withdraw from the agreement at agreed notice, either temporarily or permanently, hut they must bind themselves not to sell independently until the expiration of the agreement.    Possible difficulties may occur.   For instance,  if,  in order to avoid too severe a break in price, the selling consortium should find itself forced to retain, even temporarily, an unwieldy proportion of the amounts which it has to sell,  there might be a risk of some of its  component members becoming restive and threatening to act independently, but risks such as this must be run and silver is easier to control than almost any other product, certainly far more so than coffee or rubber.&quot;A proposal along these lines would accord, with thepolicy of the Government of India, as stated by Sir George Schusterin February,  1930, when the following public statement was madeby him : -&quot;Speaking on behalf of the Government of India. - which is an important holder and producer of silver - Sir George added that if the other interests concerned would consider the possibility of joint action toward regulating sales in order to meet the world demand,  India would willingly co-opera.te. He put the issue squarely up to the other producers, saying it depended on them to say whether they would respond.&quot;This invitation has not, however, met with any response hitherto, unless the Conference mooted by the Mexican Government is to be regarded in that light.(Mexico produces about 42 per cent, of the normal annual world production,  the United States about 23 per cent, and the British Empire about 20 per cent.     Many of the mines in Mexico and elsewhere are owned by British companies.)It appears to me,  therefore,  that the matter resolves itself into the single question whether or not it is practicable to form a consortium of the interests concerned which would be effective for the purpose of preventing a.nother fall in the price of silver,  of raising the price to a. moderate degree abovethe/
tlie present level, and of stabilising it there.      If this were found to be practicable,  there would be great advantages to British, to Indian and to Chinese interests, and to the world generally.     We should not have got rid,  of course,  of the major causes of the universal depression, but we should have got rid of one of the subsidiary causes;    and a cause which affects particular, and not unimportant, branches of industry and commerce very seriously.Whether, however, an International Conference in Mexico City would be the best means of exploring the possibilities of action is doubtful.      A Conference which resulted in nothing would be a waste of energy and of money, and would only add by its failure to the prevailing psychological depression.     A Conference which merely examined a number of grandiose schemes and dismissed them or disagreed about them, and ended with a recommendation that the practical possibilities should be examined of a. consortium such as that advocated by the Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, would leave us, after much time had been wasted, much where we are todajr.      It might be better,  at all events in the first instance, for the Governments of Great Britain (with India),  the United States and Mexico, whose countries are responsible for 85 per cent, of the production of silver, to confer together informally through a small body of expert representatives.      The Government of China might also be brought into any such consultation, in order to obviate later difficulties if a,ny plan were to be framed without Chinese co-operation from the beginning.     Very possibly such a discussion might result negatively - it might be found that no  consortium,  so comprehensive as to be likely to succeed, was possible.      On the other hand, if such a prelimina,ry discussion did result in the formulation of a definite proposal, a general International Conference might,  if necessary, be summoned later to consider it.      Perhaps there may be  objectionsto/
-12-to this course, on the ground that offence might be taken by some of the countries which had not been invited to participate in the preliminary stage.     But if that is not regarded as a serious point,  the reply to the American Ambassador might follow those lines.      This would not be an acceptance of the proposal of an immediate International Conference, which would be open-to the objections that have been stated.      Nor would it be merely a blank negative to the Mexican and American suggestion.In view of the impression which,  although mistaken, is widespread in the United States and elsewhere,  that the whole trouble with regard to silver is mainly due to the course taken by the Indian Government;    and in view of the feeling in commercial circles at home that the question is of real importance to our exporters,  I suggest that it would be inadvisable that the British Government should do no more than point out the obvious difficulties that attach to all the proposals that have been made until recently and refuse to take part in any discussion.      Moreover,  the American Government, as well as the Mexican, is apparently anxious that the  subject should be taken up seriously,  and the fact that the Ambassador deprecated obstacles to joint action being raised here cannot be left -out of account.H.S..january 7 th, 1952.
