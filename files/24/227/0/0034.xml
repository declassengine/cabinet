TH DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.[.P. 54 (32). Copy No.CABINET. STATE OF TRADE - DECEMBER. Note by the President, of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on the state of trade in December.V.R.Board of Trade. 22nd January, 1932,
STATE OF TRAPS - DECEMBER,  1931.(Summary of reports submitted to^ the Board of TradeAdvisory Council).The improvement in employment which was reported in Ootober and November continued in December, the increase being greater than the normal rise which is expected just before Christmas,    The net decrease in unemployment in December was 112,000 of whom 63,000 were amongst those wholly unemployed and 49,000 temporarily stopped, but it Is estimated that of the reduction cf 63,000 in persons wholly unemployed 35,000 are accounted for by changes in benefit conditions.    The substantial improvement of between 75,000 and 80,000 in actual employment was due ohiefly to improvement in coal mining, textiles and engineering;    employment in the building, pottery and tinplate industries fell.The receipts for railway traffic were considered more satisfactory in December, the rate of decline as compared with a year ago both by value and by tonnage being less than in recent srevious months.      This feature was specially marked in reoeipts for merchandise which were only 1.5$ below those for December last year;    the total deoline in reoeipts (goods and passenger) for December was 6.7$ compared with 8.7;?. in November, 8.8&amp; in October and 8.4% for the whole year.     Receipts from coal and coke traffic showed an increased rate of diminution in Deoember (8.2$) though the tonnage figures for these goods show a decline of mly 7,555 as compared with 12,5$ in November.Employment again improved in the ooal-mining industry during the month and the outlook generally was a little brighter.    The output figures for the year 1931 are the lowest (apart from strike years) since 1901 and exports for the year were 22$ below the 1930 total.    On the other hand exports were higher in December than in November and there is a distinctly more hopeful tone in some districts:   no improvement
9 fi 1is reported in South Wales hut there are definite signs of improvement on the North East Coast where increased export business (in some cases business which has not been done for two or three years) and even slight advances in prices are reported.Production statistics in the iron and steel trade for the year 1931 show that the output of pig iron was 39% below the output in 1930 and the output of steel ingots was 29$ below, both these being low records for many years, apart from strike years.    Exports of iron and steel were 37% below 1930 totals and imports, though below the figure reached in 1930, exceeded exports by 871,000 tons.The present outlook does not appear to be any more hopeful. After the heavy shipments in October and November the imports fell in December as had been expected, but exports were 20j,000 tons below the November figure and the output of steel was down. The output of pig iron was slightly up and. in fact higher than for any month since June but there was no change in the number of furnaces in blast.    There was no sign of improvement in reports from districts and Scotland reported a deepening of the depression:    the output there was stated to be less than 25$ of capacity at the end of the year.    At the same time the prospects for export do not improve.,      Continental prices have again fallen to low recordsi imported steel bars can be delivered at works in this country at  4.10/- per ton compared with the British price of  7, and imported steel joists at  5.10/- compared with the British price of  8.    It is stated that Continental manufacturers admit that they lose about  1 per ton on their sales for export.The year&apos;s shipbuilding figures show that tonnage under construction at the end of the year in the world as a whole was 39.7^ less than at the end of 1930 and in the United Kingdom
9 a oMjalone 55.9$ less, while vessels commenced during the last quarter showed a decrease of 46.49, for the world as a whole and 20.6^ for the United Kingdom.    The last figure is somewhat more hopeful hut the amount of tonnage commenced is at a very low level and there appears to be no dimunution in the volume of shipping laid up.    During December there has, however, been a fair amount of repair business placed.    There is very little change in the shipping position,.    The freight index fell by three points during the month and was only slightly above the level       December last year although, with the abandonment of the Gold Standard by this country, expenses in many foreign ports have necessarily increased.    Up to the present the expected improvement in coal shipments outwards has not materialised but there has been some activity and chartering for tinplates. There is practically no business doing with ^merica and Canada but Russia and the Argentine have again been chartering a considerable number of steamers.Employment continued to improve in the general engineering industry and the number of contracts placed in December was considerably greater than in recent months:    they include substantial orders for railway material for China. India, Egypt and Roumania, and for the home market and for motor vehicles for India and Egypt.      There are also a number of orders, chiefly for maohinery of various kinds,  for Russia,  including one for 37 electric furnaces, believed to be the largest single order of this kind ever placed in this country, and an order, placed after the experts had visited Continental and British works, for about one hundred oil engines for new fishing vessels,. The Danish newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot; has placed a large order in London for printing maohinery.The electrical industry reports some improvement already from the abnormal importation duties, but importers still have heavy stocks.    The sales of the lighter electrical goods, such
as domeatio fittings, have been well up on the year oompared with the best past year, and it is interesting that this position has resulted from increased sales in Lancashire and wales, which have more than offset a decrease in London and the Louth.    The demand for heavy electrical machinery is still suffering as a result of cancellation or postponement of contracts for reasons of economy.    The demand from abroad remains very unsatisfactory.usual the report from the motor industry is more satisfactory than that from most other trades.    There is a oontinued decline in total sales on the hone market, hut this is due to a falling off in the demand for high-pov/ered expensive cars; there is practically no importation of foreign cars.   Abroad the industry continues to derive definite advantage from the exchange position, and export prospects ore promising.There was some increase in employment in the ootton industry in December hut,  though the finishing   erd oontinues to show improvement, there was a diminished demand for yarn and cloth.    Japan&apos;s decision to abandon the Gold Standard did away with Lancashire&apos;s exohange advantage against her most important competitor, and at the same tine orders from China have fallen off owing to the fact that the buying season is over.    On the other hand there is a better tone in the Near Eastern markets and improvement is reported from the Argentine and the Dominions.The improvement in the woollen and v/orsted industry has been well maintained and the trade is stated to be better employed than at any time since 1929.    On the home market the duties on yarns and cloth have checked the heavy imports, and the improvement is specially marked In yarns and cloths for women&apos;s wear, large quantities of which used to be Imported.    Exports have not so far
shown the expansion which might have been expected, hut it is s atisfactory that exports of yarns in December,  though below those in November, were above those of December last year, while exports of tissues in December were higher than in either of the two preceding months and about the same-as in December last year.Reports from the hosiery industry differ.from district to district, but demand generally seems to have kept up fairly well and one report states that, while there is so far not much improvement in the export trade, enquiries are now being received more freely from countries whioh are still on the Gold Standard.      The unseasonable weather has of course had dome adverse effect on the hosiery industry.As regards other industries,  the seasonal decline in the building trade continued and there was a decline in employment in the boot and shoo trade where the improvement which followed the suspension of the Gold Standard has not been maintained.    The chemical industry, on the other hand, reports that trade is notably brighter in almost every seotion, and the report from the rubber industry is also fairly good.      In non-ferrous metals the volume of business remains small but some benefit is being derived from the increased competitive power of British products, and there has been a definite improvement in tin, -where it is reported that attempts are being made to revive the central selling organisation.The price of imported wheat fell during the month owing to the rise in sterling.    Australian crops are apparently better than at first reported and good supplies are being shipped.    Russia is not pressing to sell at the moment but she had large stocks here at the time we departed from the Gold Standard.    There is not much trade in wheat with the United States,  and it is reported that there is a proposal to give 40,000,000 bushels of wheat to the unemployed there.
It is stated that Russian and Argentine Wheats are better value at the prices prevailing.The returns of retail trade in November were better than was expected and remain, of course, very much better than those for the same period in the United States and Germany. The December results, which have not yet been received, are not expected to be very different from those for November in soite of the Christmas trade, which began late.    The English Co-operative Wholesale Society continues to report substantial increases in quantities sold compared with 1930, and a reduotion in money sales of only 1.1$; the reduction   in sales in Scotland was considerably greater, viz. 8.25?4.Financial activity was at a very low ebb during the month due partly to the season but more to the increase in the world depression,  an example of the general tone being the failure of Messrs. Purness Withy to obtain more than 25)&apos; subscription on their issue,      British Government securities, however, remained extremely firm and at the end of the month could compare in price even with similar securities in Gold Standard countries;    it was suggested that this was due to a number of onuses including the steadiness of sterling, the announcement by the Banque de Prance that they only hold  62,000,000 of sterling reserves, prompt tax payments and comparatively easy conditions in the money market.    There has been during the month an unprecedented outflow of gold from India and, although at present this is only going into reserve in France,  the United States and Holland,  it must in the end have an inflationary effeot pn the price level.    It is reported that there was a mere hopeful tone generally at the beginning of the year, due possibly to some extent to the establishment of the American Reconstruction Corporation which lg expected to have an inflationary tendency in the state the report from Australia is again encouraging;    exports of most of her products continue to be above those for the same period of 1930, and imports are very substantially down.
