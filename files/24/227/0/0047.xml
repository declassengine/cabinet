fl 9 9hk zJ faDoctiroent.....is the Property of His Britannic Ma,iesty1 s Qoyernment. )CABINET,Naval Construction Programme. Mem or aria ma by the First Lord cf the Admiralty,When the new Naval Construction Programme for 1932 was being considered by the Cabinet  (see Cabinet 4 (32) Conclusion 3), I informed the Cabinet of a suggestion which I had made direct to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it should, be considered whether the total provisionally allocated to Navy Estimates 1932 could be increased by a sum not exceeding  1,000 .,000 in order to prevent the date of ordering the ships of the 1931 Programme being postponed so late as October 1932o I pointed out that if this were found to be possible, not only would a very steep rise in Naval Construction costs in 1933 and 1934 be avoided, but the immediate result would be a very substantial alleviation of the truly desperate state to which the. shipbuilding and engineering firms are reduced at tho present time.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, has now informed me that he is unable to provide for an Increase fcr this purpose,  and I am therefore completing my Estimates on tho basis of the postponement of the orders for the 1931 Programme until October. 1932.    I think that I ought to inform the Cabinet of this result., which although doubtless inevitable will yet cause groat disappointment and distress in the shipbuilding and engineering centres.,..    B. E, MoAdmiralty,26th January, 1932u
