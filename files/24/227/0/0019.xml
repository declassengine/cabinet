REPORT.Introduction.1. UNDER its terms of reference, the Sub-Committee is &quot;to continue the work of preparation for the Disarmament Conference in its inter-departmental aspects. *2. Nearly all imaginable methods of effecting a reduction or limitation of armaments have been suggested at the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, or elsewhere. All the proposals that have been made with this object have been carefully examined by the departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government principally concerned, and a great number of papers have been written and submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Three Party Committee which met last summer.3. After everything has been said on the technical side of every proposal for the reduction and limitation of armaments, it will remain to decide on the assumption that some real progress is to be made at the Conference which is the best and most practical course to pursue.4. The Sub-Committee realises that questions of policy are outside its purview, but it might be useful to present in a compendious form the arguments for and against those proposals which appear most likely to receive serious consideration.5. In the matter of general policy, the only guide which the Sub-Committee Three Party-lias had is to be found in the conclusions of the Three Party Committee, t The Committee Three Party Committee had before it the records of the proceedings of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, together with the draft Convention prepared by that body4 It had! memoranda from the various Departments subjecting the principles of that draft to a close scrutiny, and it had various other suggestions, accompanied by expert comment. After a study of all this documentation, it came to certain conclusions, which are embodied in Paper No. D.C. (P) 50. These conclusions laid down the broad lines of a policy that might be advocated by the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva. The Committee have endeavoured to set out the practical implications of these conclusions.Resolutions as Basis of Report.6. One important question that of Budgetary Limitation although approved in principle by the Three Party Committee in its conclusions,^ was not discussed by that body in detail, and the understanding was that it would have to be remitted for further study. Most of the other questions have been dealt with in papers already circulated, and in these cases the Sub-Committee has confined itself to summarising the arguments on both sides, and referring for further detail to the original papers.7. The Sub-Committee would like to draw attention to the fact that the Three Party Resolutions were telegraphed to the Dominions in August, 1931, and they were informed at the same time that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the united Kingdom hoped to be in a position to discuss mutual problems in connection with preparation for the Disarmament Conference at an early date. There are certain questions of importance still outstanding, discussion of which with the Dominions is necessary before we can complete our own preparations. Quite apart from these special points, however, it is, of course, essential to confer with the Dominions with policy to be followed at the Conference.8. Since the Three Party Committee completed its work, further papers dealing with particular aspects and proposals had been prepared by the different Departments, and these had not been discussed by that Committee. Some of these papers bear on the subjects already dealt with by the Three Party Committee,* Cabinet 71 (31), Conclusion 3.i C.I.D. Paper No. 1060-B (also Papers Nos. CP. 195 (31) and D.C.

and such papers have been considered by the Sub-Committee in drawing up thi report. Other of these papers bear on aspects of the problem not dealt with b? the Three Party Committee, and such papers have been considered, and, in forwarding them the Sub-Committee is drawing attention in another report to any points which appear to be-of special importance.Limitations of the Sub-Committee.Three-Party Resolutions regarded as primarily for the Guidance of the United Kingdom   Dele-gates.Political Aspects of Disarmament.The Three Party Committee&apos;a Resolutions.9. The Sub-Committee, by its composition, is only fitted to present the views of the several Departments, on the technical side, for or against any particular proposals; it cannot hope in all cases to reconcile differences of opinion. It may, however, assist towards the final determination of policy by setting out clearly what may be said in each case on either side.10.   In the first part of this report, therefore, will be reproduced, paragrap by paragraph, the conclusions of the Three Party Committee, followed by the comments which the Sub-Committee have to make.Preliminary paragraph: &quot;It is suggested that the aim of the Unitei Kingdom Delegation at the Conference on Disarmament should be to carry out the principles set forth below. The occasion and method of then presentation, whether before or during the Conference, whether at Plenat Meetings or in Committee, whether after preparatory conversations an soundings, or otherwise, are matters to be decided by the Government and th Delegates with dim regard to all the circumstances of the moment.&quot;11. The Sub-Committee feels that, although it has no direct concern with this paragraph, it ought to put on record its understanding that this document is a confidential paper for the general guidance of the Delegation, and that the phrase regarding the &quot;occasion and method&quot; of the presentation of the prin ciples set forth therein does not bind the Delegation necessarily to advocate all those principles, but will leave it full discretion to decide, according to the circumstances, whether any particular proposal might be put forward with advantage, or whether any particular principle should be enunciated.Resolution 1.&quot; The Delegates should base their policy on the recognition by all Statti Members of the League of Nations, emphasised in the case of those that an parties to the Treaty of Versailles and the Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference, thai the maintenance of peace required the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and th enforcement by common action of international obligations. They shoidd, at the stage they deem appropriate, declare our readiness to fulfil our Treaty commitments and insist that they constitute an obligation of honour for all the signatories of these Treaties.&quot;12. This paragraph raises political rather than technical issues, and is, therefore, more or less outside the scope of the Sub-Committee&apos;s terms of reference. It may raise the whole &quot;security&quot; issue,* with which the Sub-Committee does not feel competent to deal, but which will doubtless have to be considered in connection with the determination of our policy at the forthcoming Disarmament Conference.Resolution 2.&quot; The Delegates should ma,he a full statement of the reductions already effected by the United Kingdom- and state that any further reductions by vs must be part of an international agreement. The Delegates will bear in mind, also, that the possibility of keeping our armaments at their present low level may haVie to be reconsidered unless there are comparable reductions by other Powers.&quot;Public 13.   The idea that our Delegates should make a full statement of theAnnouncement reductions already effected by the United Kingdom has been generally accepted, of Reductions    an(j the material is already available, but from the point of view of the Servicemade by United J rKingdom. * For the French aspect, see C.I.D. Paper No. 1062-B (also Paper No. CP. 236 (81))and also the Chiefs of Staff comments thereon, OLD; Paper No. 10G8-B (also Paper No. CP. 213 (31)).
Departments it is felt that the remainder of the first sentence needs some qualification. As drafted, it might be held to imply that we are willing to make further reductions provided other nations do the same; but it is urged strongly that, having regard to our world-wide commitments, our military strength is already at such a level as is, in some cases, barely compatible with our national security and leaves no margin for emergencies which might very easily occur in India, the Far East, or in any of the numerous countries where we have military responsibilities.14. Our naval forces, furthermore, are governed by the proportionate levels established under the Washington and London Naval Treaties, by which we have accepted, for a limited period, the utmost reductions in the size of these forces, which we can contemplate without laying bare the vital arteries of the Common-wealth. It is suggested that our object should be the reduction of other navies down to corresponding levels, and particularly to try to persuade France and Italy to subscribe to Part III of the London Naval Treaty, and- thus to eliminate the great degree of uncertainty that their continued defection engenders.15. While some increases have been made in the Air Force during recent years in order to provide for Home Defence, the completion of the programme of development, which was approved nearly 8  years ago as a first stage to the provision of a force &quot; sufficiently strong adequately to protect us against attack by the strongest air forces within striking distance of this country.&apos;&apos;* has been subject to considerable postponement and, because of the present financial stringency, seems likely to be still further retarded. In view of the very real menace to which this country is exposed and to the present predominance of the air forces maintained by our nearest Continental neighbour, it is felt that our object must be to achieve the reduction of the air forces of other powers thereby tending to mitigate to some extent our present grave inferiority.16. For the reasons given above, therefore, it is hoped that the first sentence of this Resolution may be read in the sense that our armed forces have already been reduced, and that corresponding reductions on the part of other nations are desirable to bring them into line with us. Onlv after these corresponding reductions have been made can any all-round reduction affecting ourselves be even considered.17. As regards the second sentence of this Resolution, the Sub-Committee I note that this is for the guidance of the Delegates. They need hardly point out ! that any announcement foreshadowing a possible increase of our forces would I have to be very carefully considered, and the occasion for making it very carefully j chosen, where it has not already been made public, as in Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty and the recent Bases of Agreement, tQuestion offurtherReductions.Position of Army.Position of Navy.Position of Air Force.Our Aim to Achieve Reduc-tions in the Forces of Other Powers to Levelscomparable with our Own.Possibility of our Own Forces having to be Increased.Resolution 3.&quot; In considering the armaments of particular nations, the aim should be a reduction of armaments to stich a point as will ensure for all nations a reasonable security. To reach this objective successive Conferences should be held at intervals, at each of which a further stage in the reduction of armaments would be reached. The military forces of nations, whether personnel or material, available on the outbreak of tear, should be limited in such a way as to make it unlikely for an aggressor to succeed with a knockout bloto. By this means an opportunity would be given for the various methods of conciliation and pacification to be brought into flay.&quot;18.   This Resolution is no doubt intended as an ideal.   There appears. Difficulty of however, to be great difficulty in bringing it into the sphere of practical Implementing limitation.

Possible Methods of giving Security to a State.Need for Successive Disarmament Conferences.Periods between Conferences not to be too short.Special Position of the Naval Treaties.Possible Effects of Conferences.19. The first sentence cannot be literally interpreted, for it is almostl impossible to imagine a balance of armaments that would make it impracticable! (from the purely military point of view) for, e.g., Germany, to overrun Denmark.&apos; In the naval sphere this objective is even more incapable of literal interpretation: for instance, the fleet of this country is immeasurably superior to that of a[ number of other countries, and must remain so.20. According to the theory of the &quot;knock-out blow,&quot; each country should,! so far as possible, have a strength in proportion to its neighbours, sufficient to I hold up an invasion for the time necessary for the organisation of the forces of the other Members of the League against the aggressor. The &quot; knock-out blow theory assumes particular significance in relation to Air Forces where the timel factor and the possibility of &quot; holding up &quot; attacks are largely eliminated. The I point is of great importance to the United Kingdom in view of our conspicuous j inferiority in air forces vis-a-vis those of France.21. If this is the aim each State, as far as possible, to have a reasonable chance of avoiding being overwhelmed until help comes to it we are led to consider what general method we should seek to apply in order to obtain our object.22.   Two possible methods have been suggested :  (1) An alteration in the relative levels of armaments, or (2) An all-round equal percentage reduction from existing figures.23.   If we are to accept the principle of the Resolution quoted above, it I would seem that we shall have to adopt the former alternative.   If, as we think J is the case, certain nations are considerably over-armed, a simple all round equal [ percentage reduction will not correct the evil; it will merely reproduce the same situation on a lower level.   This is not wholly true, as those who advocate such a reduction do not contemplate a further reduction of Germany&apos;s armaments, and consequently a reduction of this nature applied to France and her allies would go some way towards reducing the particular divergence between the armaments of the French bloc and those of Germany.24. The second sentence of the above Resolution proposes the holding of! successive Conferences over a period of years for the purpose of achieving aj progressive reduction of armaments. It is fully realised that the first I Disarmament Conference cannot, except by a miracle, achieve that degree of reduction which is its avowed aim. Progress must necessarily be slow, but so-] long as it is sure, no cavils can be raised.25. On the other hand, the Sub-Committee would like to point out that, in their opinion, it is desirable that the intervals between these Conferences should not be too short. They have in mind, as suitable, the 10-year intervals content plated by the Covenants An exception to this general rule will, however, be necessary in the case of any naval agreements arrived at next year, which must clearly be co-terminous with the Washington and London Naval Treaties. The holding of successive Conferences is, as we have said above, probably inevitable. There may be advantage or disadvantage in this. On the one hand, it is held that to hold Conferences at short intervals is liable to arouse a feeling of armament consciousness; that is, to incite nations to stake out theoretical quotas greatly in excess either of what they can afford or can legitimately claim, or in extreme cases of what they actually want.   On the other hand, it is possible that, after the firstl,^^ r.-----nao uccnand the first Disarnicunent Convention signed, uovem-special Position ^f Young States; Need for Freedom for Legitimate Development of Defensive Armaments.ments may realise that they are no worse, and indeed better, off, and they may at a subsequent Conference be prepared for further reductions.26. There is one further point which it may be convenient to mention here. Some apprehension is felt, it is understood, in the Dominions, and in particular in the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, that the Disarmament Conference may stabilise armaments at their existing levels, irrespective of the circumstances of each State.  It is thought that, in practice, armament levels wil&apos;* Vide article 8.
0 f: restablished by a system of quotas and not on actual existing levels; but the point is of importance, because a young country like Australia is at present unable to maintain forces of a size adequate to protect her national interests. Money is required for the development of the State. In due course, however, she may find herself able to divert more funds to needs of security, and she is naturally anxious that the door should not be closed on what she regards as the maintenance of a reasonable defensive scale of armaments.Resolution 4.&quot; In determining the limit to be fixed for any country, account must be taken of its circumstances political, geographical and international. In the first stage of what is intended to be a progressive policy of international-disarmament, it is necessary to take into account considerations of security and the bearing thereon of recent history. Allowance, for example, should be made for the circumstances of a nation like France, which has been twice invaded and once devastated within living memory, and is naturally suffering apprehensions for its security which cannot be allayed in a short time. It is no less important that Germany should be given security against invasion by her neighbours, who, collectively, are at present in a position to overtohelm her.&quot;27. The last sentence of this Resolution is covered by the observations which Ithe Sub-Committee has already submitted on Resolution 3 (paragraphs 18-26).The Sub-Committee realise that in any attempt to fix relative levels regard j must be had to the principle enunciated in the first sentence, and in no case more [than our own does this essential principle apply.Resolution 5.&quot; The principle of combining security ivith limitation of offensive power raises two aspects of disarmament, namely, (a) its total amount, e.g\, total sea, land and air forces; (b) the specific character of the armaments, including range and destructive capacity.&quot;28. The Sub-Committee understand that the purpose of this paragraph is to draw attention to the necessity for considering the potential aggressive engths of nations, and that it was also framed with the idea that it would be of advantage to the cause of disarmament if distinctions could be drawn between offensive and defensive weapons. If it were, indeed, possible to discriminate between offensive and defensive weapons, there would be obviously great advantage in this principle. It has also been noted that, when the Allies desired to deprive the Central Powers of all possibility of committing an aggression, they denied them the possession of tanks, heavy guns, and military aircraft.29. Since these Resolutions were framed, this question has been the subject of a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1064-B) * in which it is clearly shown that no hard and fast distinction can be drawn between offensive and defensive weapons. This report confirms the unanimous finding of a Sub-Commission of the League, which was to the effect that practically no weapons could be truly classed as solely defensive.!We are aware it has been argued that by the prohibition of certain tVDes of weaDons it miedit be possible to strengthen the nower of defence* x x w x cj x -relatively to the power of attack. Advocates of this principle have demanded particularly the prohibition of heavy guns, tanks and aircraft. While it may be granted that these weapons and, in particular, tanks and aircraft, are primarily offensive in their nature, and that they should be subject to limitation, direct or indirect, in common with other forms of armament, the fact must not be* Also Paper No. CP. 258 (31).I The following is the appropriate quotation from this report:  &quot; Generally speaking, and subject to the conditions stated below, any component elements of armaments which are incapable of mobility by means of self-contained power or can only be transported after a long delay, can only be used for the defence of the territory in which they are erected.&quot;   (Eeport of Sub-Commission A, page 141.)Need forconsideringPotentialAggressiveStrengths ofNations.Possibility ofDiscriminatingbetweenOffensive andDefensiveWeapons.Chief of Staff Eeport.Possibility of &apos; prohibiting certain Types of offensive Weapons.Disadvantages of prohibiting certain Types or Offensive Weapon.

This Resolution raises a number of issues of importance and of a divers nature.   The first sentence only has been quoted above, because in it is raised! the question of Budgetary Limitation, and it is desired to deal with this issuel first.   The remainder of this Resolution is given at the end of these paragraph; dealing with Budgetary Limitation, together with such observations as it desired to put forward.31.   At the Preparatory Committee of 1927, the French Delegation sub-l mitted a draft Disarmament Convention, which included articles providing foil Budgetary limitation.    Although this proposal received some support, it wal not definitely accepted as one of the cardinal points of limitation.   As a resul; of the discussions on the possibilities of limiting land war materials, however, during which it was evident that none of the Governments represented wers prepared to accept any form of direct (numerical) limitation of such material it came to be recognised that the only possibility lay in a limitation of the amount that might be expended thereon.   Although the main idea of including budgetary limitation was not unanimously accepted, and in its place Budgetary Publicity was adopted so far as the First Reading text was concerned, the following sentence was included in the preamble to the article dealing with Budgetary Expenditure :  &quot; Whereas it is in the general interest that the expenditure on armamenbj should be limited.&quot;The idea of budgetary limitation has been present, therefore, since the inceptionl of the Draft Disarmament Convention, though its evolution to the form in whictj it now appears was subject to certain vicissitudes.32. Many Delegations at Geneva have constantly upheld the theory of equal treatment of ail three services, and it came, therefore, to be considered whether budgetary limitation should not be applied to the naval and the air services as well. The advocates of budgetary limitation, after examination of the question, from being advocates of it merely as a &quot; second best &quot; alternative to direct limitation, evolved to the view that budgetary limitation possessed virtues of its own not common to other forms.33. The considerations which led them to this view may be summarised as follows : c, (1) Budgetary limitation affords a measure of automatic control, for the reason that in any country sufficiently developed to be a danger from the point of view of large-scale production of war material, there a sufficient check on public expenditure to make it impossible for the Government to devote appreciable sums to the manufacture or purchase of such material without the fact becoming known. (2) Without budgetary limitation, there is no certainty that simple numeric: limitation will eliminate the possibility of a dangerous competitioi in armaments. The German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; has been quoted as an example. Whether that is an exact case in point or not, it is clear that limits might be fixed to the displacement and armament of each class of naval vessel, and to the number of vessels in each class that a country might possess, and yet leave the field clear for a certain amount of competition in the development and perfection of units. And on the assumption that each improvement and each step inai
development would probably involve an increase in expenditure, such competition would have serious financial and economic results. One of the objects -if not the major object of disarmament is to prevent, or at least set limits to, the wasteful and unproductive expenditure incurred on armaments by the principal naval and military Powers. The same argument applies, with perhaps even greater force,, to air armaments. Aircraft, in spite of recent developments, must probably be regarded as being as yet in an experimental stage. The aeroplane of ten years hence may cost a good deal more than the type employed for similar duties costs at the present time. To limit a country to-day to the possession of, say, 200 aeroplanes, gives no idea of what a country might be free to spend on its air force in 1941. A simple numerical limit, moreover, would almost inevitably tend to encourage the development of larger, more powerful and more costly units. The possibilities of competition would hardly be affected by the imposition of any numerical limit that Governments would be ready to accept to-day. Competition might have been eliminated to some extent by the Preparatory Commission^ proposal for the imposition of a limit on total horse-power, but such a device has been pronounced by the , Air Ministry to be impracticable (see Paper No. CP. 265 (31)). (3) It has been argued that a budgetary limitation is more &quot; flexible &quot; than any other. At the last session of the Preparatory Commission, the Belgian Delegate pointed out that it had this advantage over direct limitation, that if, in 1914, there had been a direct limitation, by schedules, of the various forms of armament then existing, there would have been no limitation on tanks, and that, consequently, Governments would have been free to build what they liked. Budgetary limitation placed to some degree a check on unforeseen developments.(4) It has been suggested that the Budgetary Limitation figures may be used for purposes of comparison. It is pointed out, however, that the Budgetary Limitation figures will be fixed by agreement at Geneva, and that having been once thus agreed, there could be no question of comparison arising afterwards. In reaching such agreement it must, however, obviously be accepted that there will be differences due to the increased cost of pay and materials, &amp;c, in different countries, and it is assumed that no country should or could accept Budgetary Limitation unless the fact of such differences is accepted.34.   In November 1930 the Cabinet took the following decision (Cabinet 66 Previous (30), Conclusion 5).   &apos;&apos; As regards budgetary limitation, that, having regard to the Cabinet extent to which the United Kingdom is already committed to the principle it should     -lblon-be reaffirmed, but that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should call the attention of the United Kingdom delegates at the Preparatory Commission, now in session at Geneva, to the objections and the risks set forth by the Secretary of State for Air and incorporated in the report attached to Paper No. CP. 371 (30).&apos;&apos; Acting in accordance with this decision, the United Kingdom Delegate at the Preparatory Commission in November 1930 submitted proposals for the separate limitation of total expenditure on each service, and for the separate limitation of the expenditure on war material in each service.   The Commission accepted the principle of the limitation of total expenditure on land, sea and air forces combined, but referred the question of the practicability of limitation of expenditure on each service separately to the Committee of Budgetary Experts, who subsequently reported that such limitation was feasible.*The Commission accepted Budgetary Limitation for war material in the naval and land forces, but rejected it for air forces.35. Such are the origins of Budgetary Limitation and the reasons which led to its adoption and insertion in the draft Convention. It is now proposed to deal with the particular Service aspects of this proposal more especially in regard to its application in practice. In the main body of the Report it is proposed to deal only with general principles, but there is included also as an annexe a resume t* Eeport of Committee of Budgetary Experts, Chapter 13 (Paper No. D.C. (P.) o). I Appendix &quot; A.&quot;
of the more important details as set out in the Report by the Committee of Budgetary Experts appointed by the Preparatory Commission to work out a practical scheme.Explanation of 35    Before proceeding to discuss the practical issue of budgetary limitationLimitation.       *n relation *o its application to the three Services, it is desirable to comment 011 what is believed to be a popular conception of this form of limitation.37. The Sub-Committee have reason to think that the view is widely held that Budgetary Limitation is intended to be a new and independent method of limiting navies, armies and air forces; and that it will be applied to the existing estimates of all countries, with perhaps a small margin for contingencies.v . . .38.   The Sub-Committee are of the opinion that this view is untenable.Quantitative limitation, in the case of the. Navy and Air Force,   is the accepted method of limitation.    Budgetary limitation for these Services isa supplementary device and is intended principally to prevent the develop-ment, within the numerical limits accepted, of more costly, more scientific and more destructive weapons.   It is an additional check and is not meant,except in the case of land Avar material, for Avhich it has not been possibleto devise any quantitative limit, to be the primary system.   As, therefore,budgetary limitation is supplementary to numerical limitation it must be directly related to it; this means that, the numerical limits once fixed, the budgetary limitation figures must be framed so as to allow all countries freedom to buildup to the numerical limits, if they have not already done so.39. In the ensuing paragraphs will be found some reference to the question of margins arid it is desired to emphasise that by margin is meant the difference between the actual current estimates* and the budgetary limitation figures. And since budgetary limitation figures must be such as to alloAV a country to attain its full Treaty rights in respect of numerical limitation, it is clear that a country which has not maintained its forces at the full strength allowed will have a larger budgetary &quot; margin &quot; than one aa&quot;hich has taken the opposite course. In short, the less ready for Avar a country is, the greater the margin it will be entitled to claim.40. If, then, any attempt were made to get general acceptance of a budgetary limitation system based on the principle of a small margin between &apos;&apos; limitation &quot; and &quot; estimate &quot; figures (which as we have pointed out above is at present a widely held vieAV of what budgetary limitation implies) the limitation Avould have the folloAving paradoxical results (a) It Avouldi favour the country which, in time of peace, maintains its armed forces in a state of constant readiness for Avar.(5) It Avould invite and indeed necessitate an immediate increase in peace expenditure on the part of countries like our own. which are at present the least ready for Avar.It is clear from the above that the system of closely relating budgetary figures to estimates is, in fact, quite impracticable and inconsistent with the other forms of limitation to which budgetary limitation is supplementary, and, in any case, there can be no doubt that Avhile nations are negotiating about the size of their forces they Avill not alloAV their negotiations to be stultified by a financial provision which would not permit the size of the forces to be reached.41. It is certain, therefore, that if effect is given to budgetary limitation at all, it must be on the system mentioned above, in Avhich the limitation figures will be based on Treaty rights Avifh regard to direct or numerical limitation, and Avhich Avill consequently accord a larger margin to a nation AAdiich has not taken advantage of its full Treaty rights than is given to a nation which has adopted the opposite policy.* The term &quot; estimates&quot; is more for convenience, but the actual figure referred to is, of course, that contained in the statement of expenditure to be published annually as drawn up by the Committee of Budgetary Experts in the Model Statement.
9 f) O42. The theoretical value of budgetary limitation is clearly not great when large margins exist, but it has been argued that it has a certain value because a wide margin, besides demonstrating the peaceful intentions of a country, may be of advantage in that it will have freedom, within its Treaty rights, to modernise its equipment and to take advantage of any new developments; whereas a country with little or no margin will be definitely cramped in this respect.43. Naturally time must be a factor in these considerations, for although a country with a wide margin may be theoretically in a good position provided she has time to use it, she would be at a grave disadvantage if she were suddenly to be confronted by war with a country which, by keeping up to its full Treaty limits, was in a strong position at the moment. The fact of a wide margin on one side and a small one on the other would become irrelevant, and the argument would be settled by the forces then in existence.44. It is hoped that this exposition of the exact signification of budgetary limitation has served to make the position clear, and it is only desired to add that, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee, the only conditions under which budgetary limitation can be accepted are that it is based on and coincident with the numerical limitation figures which have either been negotiated already or will be the subject of negotiation at the Conference. Any attempt to relate the budgetary limitation figures to existing estimates, would cut clean across the numerical limitation treaties which, it is assumed, will form the basis of the results achieved at the coming Conference, and, in our case, would have the effect of stabilising our forces at a level both absolutely and relatively lower than the needs of the Commonwealth demand.45. With regard to the foregoing paragraphs (36-44), the Treasury wishes to reserve their views as to the relative merits of the budgetary as against the quantitative method and, also, as to the desirability of combining the two methods The department, further, must reserve its views as to the possible effects of stabilizing the relative armament levels that obtain to-day. It is, in the Treasury view, vital that the practical implications of disarmament policy, as they may affect expenditure, should be kept in the forefront.46.   Before passing to the actual discussions of the practical application of Proposal for a Budgetary Limitation to the three Service Departments, it may be relevant to 25 per cent, draw attention to a proposal which has been receiving some publicity : i.e., that Budgetarv ut-a possible formula of reduction might be on the basis of a 25 per cent, all round reduction on existing budgets.  It must be obvious, from what has been said in the immediately preceding paragraphs, that such a proposal is based on a misconcep-t,ion of the system of budgetary limitation and would, if applied, have the effect of scrapping the existing naval limitation treaties, and of penalising most severely those countries who have been keeping their armament expenditure down to the lowest possible levels.   In other words, it would stabilise existing disproportionately-portionate relative levels which it must be one of the aims of the Conference to adjust.47.   The Navy is at present limited in size of ships and tonnage according Application of ^ to categories by the Washington and London Naval Treaties and the Admiralty Budgetary Limi-have always taken the view that this is the only really effective method of naval ^tlon to the limitation.   The principle of superimposing Budgetary Limitation on to the 1 avy&quot; existing methods of limitation as applied in the Treaties was accepted by the Admiralty only with the definite reservation, inserted against Article 24 of the Draft Convention, to the effect that this country could only accept Budgetary Limitation for naval forces provided all the other principal maritime Powers also agreed to accept it.  This reservation has a special significance in that the United States of  America have so far  declared  themselves unable,  for technical constitutional reasons, to accept Budgetary Limitation.   In passing, it might be noted that, although the reservation was applied only to Article 24-Limitation of Naval War Material of the draft Convention, it must obviously apply with equal force to Article 29 Limitation of Total Naval Expenditure and this point was confirmed in a general statement made by the United Kingdom repre-sentative at the Sixth Session of the Preparatory Commission.[6199]        . c 2
48. It has, been assumed that the basis of any discussion on naval limitation at the Disarmament Conference will be the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and this point is of particular importance in connection with Budgetary Limitation, because all parties to these Naval Treaties will obviously claim Budgetary freedom to build and equip their navies up to the limits imposed by these Treaties.49. It is observed in this connection, that this country is at present maintaining the strength of its naval forces considerably below that allowed by these Treaties; but such action, the Admiralty emphasise, must not be interpreted as abrogating in any way the right to construct up to the full Treaty limits should the necessity arise. This leads to the point that any Budgetary Limitation figure accepted for our naval forces would have to be computed on the basis of enabling us (1) To build as quickly as practicable up to the limits allowed by theWashington and London Naval Treaties should the political situationrender such a course necessary. (2) To man fully the ships as they are built as well as existing ships.   (Atpresent many of our ships, as a matter of economy, are only partiallymanned.)(3) To equip the ships with full allowances of ammunition.   (The allowances are temporarily reduced as a matter of economy.)The resulting figure will obviously show a large margin over our estimate figure because we are considerably below our treaty limits. On the other hand a country like Japan should show a much smaller margin because she has taken fuller advantage of her Treaty allowances.50. In addition, it is not considered that any Budgetary Limitation should be accepted which would restrict our right adequately to replace reserves or prevent the development ,of auxiliary services, even though, as a matter of economy, such action is not being taken at present. In particular, in connection with this point, the retarding of the development of the Singapore Base might be cited. It is presumed that it is not desired to be bound by any financial restrictions which might prejudice the completion of this base at any time it might be so desired. The same thing would apply in connection with the building up of the reserves of oil fuel for the Fleet.The operation of the ten years&apos; peace assumption makes these questions of particular importance for this country, since, under such an assumption, reserves and auxiliary services are inevitably much behind hand. It is also pointed out that Navies have to undertake, at times, large blocks of expenditure, the amount of which would be unforeseen, but which are necessary for the safety of the ships and their crews; as recent instances may be quoted, bulging and anti-aircraft installations. It will accordingly be necessary for the margin between the budgetary limitation figure and the estimate figure to be further increased in order to allow for the making good of deficiences Avhich at present exist under the operation of the 10-year peace assumption.51. It may not in practice prove possible to make good deficiencies between what we have and what we are allowed by Treaty immediately, and it may well prove that in practice our necessary expenditure for this purpose might be higher in successive years. The Admiralty therefore are opposed to acceptance of the Budgetary Experts&apos; proposal that there shall be an undertaking not to exceed in any year the average of a four-yearly period by more than a fixed percentage, because this might imply an abrogation of Treaty rights and a vitiation of the principle that the budgetary limitation figures are based on the numerical limitation figures.Application of 52.   So far as land armaments are concerned, the War Office have alwaysBudgetary Limi- been convinced of the necessity for a limitation on the total expenditure on land tation to the forces owing to the extreme&apos; difficulty of getting any other satisfactory and Army* effective method for limiting land armaments, and as a valuable reinforcement of
any other means of limitation adopted, such as limitation of effectives. So long as the total military expenditure is limited, no State would be in a position to indulge in a competition of armaments so far as land forces are concerned.53. The War Office are convinced that limitation of expenditure is a practical and effective method of reinforcing any other method of limitation decided upon, and that the more effectually expenditure on each service is isolated the more effective will be the result. Its value would be largely negatived if the limitation were applied to the combined total of expenditure on all three Services and not to each Service separately, or if even limited virement were permitted.54. As regards limitation of expenditure on land war material, this principle was also accepted by the Cabinet in their approval of C.I.D. Paper No. 1016-B on the 15th October, 1930,* and reaffirmed by the Cabinet on the 6th November, 1930. tThe War Office, as stated in that paper, do not oppose this form of limita-tion and consider it preferable to limitation of war material by categories and enumeration.55.   There is one point to which reference may perhaps be made at this Need for Fit stage.   The Committee of Budgetary Experts included expenditure on coast dom for Coast defence under the naval heads of their Model Statement; this is entirely opposed to Defence Expen current practice in this country whereby expenditure on fixed coast defences is an dlture-army responsibility.   The Admiralty agree that it is not possible or desirable to alter this procedure and that it is really immaterial under which Head it is shown so long as it is definitely included.   The Admiralty are, naturally, very interested in this matter which concerns intimately the safety of bases for the Fleet, without, which its freedom of operation would be impossible.   The committee desire to emphasise, therefore, that we should not bind ourselves, financially or otherwise, in such a way as might prevent us from completing and modernising our coast defences, which, as has been pointed out in other papers, have been unavoidably allowed to become out of date.J56. On the question of margins, it has not been found possible to obtain any definite information from the War Office as the Army Council do not consider the Sub-Committee is a competent body to deal with this important matter of policy.57.   The reasons for which the Air Ministry question the advisability of Application ofthis form of limitation are various.   They are  set  out in Memorandum BudgetaryNo. R.A. I. 5,5 but may be briefly summarised as follows :  Limitation to^ J J the Air Force.(a) Considerations of national safety require the claim to a right at least ofparity in our air strength with that of France. But the present actual disparity between the size of our air forces and those of France is so great that a budgetary limitation figure based on parity in strengths would inevitably be far above the amount of our present air expenditure even if it could be assumed (which at present there seems no reason for doing) that the French would be prepared to make any substantial reductions in the size of their air forces. .(b) The superimposition of budgetary limitation upon  the  limitationsalready provided- for in the Draft Convention by (i) numbers of aircraft, and (ii) effectives would create a new and additional standard which would greatly complicate the problem of international agreement. The budgetary figures would inevitably become a standard of international comparison, however fallacious such comparison would be in view of the differences between the relative costs of armaments in different countries, especially as between conscript and non-conscript countries.* Cabinet 60 (30), Conclusion 11. t Paper No. D.C. (P.) 6.\ Cabinet 66 (30), Conclusion 5. 5 Also Paper No. CP. 264 (31).
(c) Budgetary limitation would detract from the value of budgetary publicity in that once it was established, expenditure below the maximum suit allowable under budgetary limits could not be challenged. If however, budgetary publicity only is retained it might be possible to draw attention to any sudden or marked increases over and abovf previous levels of expenditure.(d) Budgetary limits, though primarily related to limitations on aircrafiand personnel, would tend to be fixed by each country at a figure whicl allowed full margin for contingencies, with the result that the limit would always be in excess of requirements and would consequent not provide an effective restriction.58. A further factor which inevitably complicates the superimposition of budgetary limitation of air forces is that of civil aviation. In most countries, expenditure upon civil aviation aircraft industries, landing grounds, organisa tion and equipment, is organically inseparable from their military air expendi ture. It is obvious that the civil aviation activities of any country would lie outside the province of budgetary limitation which would, therefore, omit what undoubtedly would be a powerful factor in a future war. In other words expenditure upon civil aircraft, civil aviation industries, and civil aviation ground organisation not only has a direct bearing upon the cost of air armament and equipment, but also provides facilities for increasing the aggressive potentialities tialities of the combatant forces. Budgetary limitation would have no effec upon this important factor, which has special significance to this country wher civil aviation, for geographical and other reasons, is never likely to attain developments equal to those in other European countries.59. The Admiralty made the point that they could not accept any Budgetary Limitation which would prevent them from building up or maintaining adequate reserves. This point is of particular importance to the Air Ministry because, for reasons of economy, very little provision has been made for war reserves. It is obviously of importance that full liberty should be retained to make provision for adequate reserves should it be so desired.60. Finally, to come down to the question of margins, the Air Ministry have told us in general terms that their margin will be a fairly large one. Obviously this margin must depend on the quantitative limitation figures, and, until these figures are fixed, no budgetary limitation figure can be calculated, and consequently the size of the margin must remain a matter of speculation. On the assumption, however, that our numerical figures will give us the right to an air force of the same size as is allowed to France, the margin between our budgetary limitation figure and our estimates figure might be considerable.61. So far as the three Service Departments are concerned, therefore, it will be seen that, while the Admiralty are willing to accept budgetary limitation in principle, subject to its acceptance by the other Principal Naval Powers, they have put forward a number of reasons which indicate that the value of this additional check-will be vitiated because of the necessity of allowing sufficient margin to implement our rights under existing Naval Treaties, which provide for the direct limitation of Naval war material and for other purposes. The War Office, on the other hand, have always strongly supported this proposal on the grounds that it is the only practicable method of providing for limitation of land war material, while the Air Ministry are opposed altogether to the application of this principle to air forces.62. As regards the application of budgetary limitation to the Navy, it need only perhaps be pointed out, in order that both sides of the picture may be presented, that it was suggested with the idea of putting some further check to the limitation already imposed by the Naval Treaties, on the assumption that it might prevent the development of more highly scientific, costly and destructive weapons. The quantitative limits imposed by the Washington and London Naval Treaties must, in our opinion, form the starting point of any discussions at the Disarmament Conference, and it is of vital importance that no action should be taken which might throw these hard-won agreements again into the melting-pot. Only where the numerical data lines have been accepted can the question of the budgetary limitation figures be discussed.Summary of Position of the Three Services in regard to Budgetary Limitation.
63. As regards the application of budgetary limitation to land war material, it is obvious that, without this limiting factor, and in the absence of any direct limitation, no restrictions of any kind will be placed on the manufacture of weapons of all kinds. The idea of applying budgetary limitation to air forces was somewhat analogous to that for Naval forces, in that it was held that numerical limitation, while providing a certain check, would not prevent the evolution of more destructive and highly scientific weapons. The proposal that air war material should be limited by means of budgetary limitation was, however, rejected by the Preparatory Commission.64.   There remain only to be added the views of the Treasury on this The Treasury important question.   It is understood that this Department desires to reserve View on judgment until it is possible to state definitely the margins which the Service Budgetary Departments suggest should be allowed between their Budgetary Limitation and Limitatlon-their estimate figures.     The view has been expressed, however, that if these margins are to be large the value  of budgetary limitation will be largely theoretical.   From the Treasury point of view, the production of figures greatly in excess of those presented in the estimates is obviously undesirable.65. As regards the question of virement the Budgetary Experts devoted a The Meaning of chapter of their Report to the mechanism by which this could be effected. Vire- Virement. ment means the right to transfer sums within a global total from one Service allotment to another. The question can only arise if it should be decided that separate limitations should be set for each of the three services, sea, land and air (as to which no provision is to be found at present in the Draft Convention). It should be observed that the Experts did not deal with the question as it affects war material which it is proposed in the Draft Convention should be limited separately in the case of the Navy and Army though not in the case of the Air I Force.66. The issue of policy to be decided is whether it is desirable that a country having agreed a total armaments expenditure should be allowed to develop one service at the expense of either or both of the others. Virement clearly might result in upsetting to some extent the equilibrium which it is one of the obj ects of the Conference to achieve.67. The Experts showed two ways of achieving a limited degree of I virement: -&quot;1. A limit (A) would be fixed for the aggregate expenditure on the three forces and separate limits (a, b, c) for the total expenditure on the several forces, limit (A) being less than the sum of a, b and c.&quot;&quot;2. A separate limit would be fixed for the total expenditure on each of the forces, out percentages of virement authorised1 between these three limits would also be prescribed. These percentages would be selected, by agreement between the Powers represented at the Disarmament Conference, for each country in accordance with its special situation.&quot;68. Paragraphs 36-64 on budgetary limitation lead to the conclusion that the global total should be built up by adding agreed separate totals for each Service. Virement by percentage the second alternative would seem to follow from this, if the principle is accepted at all.69. It is understood that certain nations will press for the right to vire either because their defence expenditure is controlled by one department or because they regard fluidity between Services in matters of defence expenditure though separated for purposes of League returns) as a vital principle.70.   The point to be decided is what is the advantage or disadvantage of a mited  freedom  to  vire.    This leads  back  to  the  question  of  margins I and the issue becomes important if the margin between the budgetary limitation figure and the actual expenditure is low.   If a State is permitted large margins because its armaments are substantially lower than the numerical limits allowed to it, the power of virement would be unimportant.   A State, however, which hadbuilt up to its treaty limits would ex hypothesi have smaller margins and might     ----Well demand a degree of elasticity that would be undesirable. As to the desir- j (TppcajQ ^ o. ability of virement Service opinion is divided.   The Admiralty and War Officer 7/]^(The views of the Admiralty and War Office are set out in OLD. Papers / j)iW16-B and 1025-B.) * Cf^Lii-
The Position of 71.   Before leaving finally the question of budgetary limitation, there is onethe Fleets of the p0int to which it is desired to draw attention. Under the Washington and London S0Bud-etIr Naval Treaties the Fleets of the several Members of the British Commonwealth LimitaldonTs are taken together for the purpose of limiting the number and tonnage of ships of Applied to Naval war. The actual practical allocation as between the several Members of the Forces. Commonwealth, of the allowed numbers and tonnage is a domestic matter to bearranged between the Members themselves, so long as the agreed total is not exceeded. If it should eventually be decided to accept budgetary limitation foi Naval Forces, and particularly if, as is anticipated, the provisions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties are to remain the governing instrument; as far as numbers and tonnage are concerned, it would seem clear that some special arrangement is required in connection with the limitation of expenditure on the Naval Forces maintained by the several Members of the Commonwealth, particularly as regards Naval war material- (Head IV of Table C of the Model Statement), the expenditure on which it is specifically proposed to limit in the Draft Convention (vide Article 24).72. This question was dealt with in a paper circulated to the Imperial Conference, 1930 (Paper No. E (30) 27), which is annexed as an appendix* to the present Report. This paper was prepared as a basis for discussion and was considered by the Imperial Conference before the Report of the Preparatory Commission and of the Committee of Budgetary Experts had been issued, and il was then agreed that an exchange of views should take place as soon as was practicable. It will be seen that, in that paper, three possible ways in which this matter might be dealt with were set out, namely : (1) To limit the Naval budget of each Government separately, allowing sufficient margin for a possible increase in the Naval forces of that Government within the collective limit prescribed by the London Naval Treaty for all Members of the Commonwealth.(2) The Governments of the Commonwealth should submit to separate budgetary limitation, the possibility of expansion, so far as new construction is concerned, being provided for, not by adding an unlimited margin to each budget, but by claiming the right of transfer between the budgets of the several Members according as it may be agreed hereafter to apportion the share of each in the collective tonnage. Such margin would, of course, be subject to the proviso that the sum total of the several budgets, as separately prescribed in the Disarmament Convention, shall not thereby be exceeded.(3) For the purpose of the Disarmament Convention the amounts of the Naval budgets of the several Governments of the Commonwealth should be combined to form a single whole, which should be inserted in the Convention as the total amount of the Naval budgets of all Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Within this total the allocation between the several Members of the amounts of their respective Naval budgets would be a purely domestic matter for discussion and agreement between themselves.73. The various advantages and disadvantages of each of those proposal; were also indicated, and it was suggested that any solution should be based on the following considerations :  (1) The total margin allowed for contingencies should be kept as low as possible to avoid creating a precedent for other members of the League.(2) The procedure adopted should be in accordance with the status of the several Members of the Commonwealth as separate members of the League.(3) The procedure adopted should not be such as to prevent complete flexibility of arrangements as regards the relative shares of the several Governments in the naval defence of the Empire.(4) Such adjustment of naval budgets within the Commonwealth should be regarded! as a purely domestic matter, and not as a matter for the League of Nations to discuss.* Appendix &quot; B.&quot;
74. Bearing these desiderata in mind, a solution was suggested in that paper which would now be on the following lines : In the tables for limitation of expenditure to be annexed to Article 24 (expenditure on Naval war material) and Article 29 (in so far as concerns total expenditure on Naval forces) of the Draft Convention, the figures for expenditure of each Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be given separately, but they would be grouped together in a single block. At&apos;the end of the group the aggregate figures for the British Commonwealth of Nations should be shown, perhaps in italics. A footnote to this total Avould then be added, stating that transfer is allowed by arrangement between the different Members within this declared total. The&quot; method most likely to ensure that the Tables in the Disarmament Convention were arranged in this manner would appear to be for each individual member of the British Commonwealth of Nations to submit to the General Disarmament Conference its own limitation figures, and to show at the same time the limitation figures for the total naval expenditure of all Members of the Commonwealth, or, if it were thought preferable, the individual limitation figures for the other members, together with a footnote as suggested.75. It should, however, be pointed out that a solution on these lines, or, indeed, any solution including the principle of transfer between the Members of the Commonwealth raises the following special questions : (a) If there is to be, under Article 29, limitation of expenditure by a singlefigure for land, sea and air forces, taken together, such a figure would have to be allocated separately to each of the Members of the Common-wealth; if, however, proposals with regard to transfer in respect of Naval expenditure between the Members of the Commonwealth are adopted, it would have to be provided that the single limitation figure for the three Services of any Member of the British Commonwealth might also be increased by the amount of such transfer, provided that the collective total of the single figures allocated to all the Members of the Commonwealth were not exceeded.(b) If, alternatively, there is to be separate limitation of expenditure on thethree Services, with a degree of virement between the three limitation figures, it would be necessary to combine this system of virement with that of transfer between the Naval expenditures of the several Members of the Commonwealth; this would probably prove to be very difficult in practice, since the separate quota of Naval expenditure allotted to each Member of the British Commonwealth would not be a definite fixed sum, but would itself be liable to increase through transfer between it and the quota of another Member.If, however, there is separate limitation of expenditure for each of the three services without any provision for virement between the three limitation figures, the special points under (a) and (b) above would not arise.76. This question has been dealt with in some detail since it is of some importance in connection with the consideration of policy in regard to quotas and margins.77. The War Office may be faced with a somewhat similar difficulty. Army Votes receive as appropriations-in-aid payments in respect of services rendered and stores supplied to other members of the Commonwealth, who, in virtue of their separate representation at Geneva, will render separate returns under the Disarmament Convention.The instructions (as at present drafted in the Budgetary Experts report) for completing the Model Statement provide for the deduction of receipts only where nco-deduction would lead to double counting of expenditure in the same return. Receipts from members of the Commonwealth rendering a separate return are therefore not deducted in compiling the War Office portion of the Model State-ment for the United Kingdom, and any reduction in these receipts would not affect the limitation figure. The Admiralty, on the other hand, for the reasons feferred to in paragraph 75 will deduct all receipts from the Dominions. The Admiralty further point out that exceptional cases may arise in which expendi-
Possible Method of Applying Budgetary Limitation to the Navy with Reference to Existing Treaties.ture by this country may be incurred on behalf of another member of the League other than a Dominion; for example, the Admiralty recently incurred considerable expenditure in reconditioning a battleship for Chile. The Admiralty press that power should be reserved to deduct in their return the receipts in respect of such exceptional services, as otherwise provision would have to be made for such exceptional expenditure in the limitation figure. The War Officer, however, doubt whether if this question were raised the deduction of receipts, as suggested bv the Admiralty, would be confined to exceptional cases, and they fear that it would clearly have to be extended to admit of the deduction in the return of the recipient party of all receipts in respect of military services rendered to other parties to the Convention. In that case the War Office would have to take account of the fact that a reduction in its receipts from other members of the Common-wealth would probably not be accompanied by an equal reduction in expenditure, and would thus increase net expenditure on Army Votes. The War Office would accordingly have to provide against the possibility of reduction in these receipts, either by provision in the margin between current expenditure and the limiting figure, or by reserving a power of transfer between the limits of the War Office and the other members of the Commonwealth concerned. Similar considerations apply to the possibilities of increases in the receipts in question and of variations in payments borne by Army Votes&apos;which pass from the United Kingdom to other members of the Commonwealth.The same situation arises in the case of the Air Ministry.78. The London Naval Treaty remains in force until the 31st December, I 1936, and any scheme for budgetary limitation should end at that date, it being expected that a Naval Conference in 1935 will consider the question- of the revision of the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Treaty. Therefore, budgetary limitation should only apply up to the 31st December, 1936, so far as the Navy is concerned, i.e., it should absolutely terminate at that date and not continue in force as suggested in Articles 58 and 59 of the Draft Disarmament Convention. In that case budgetary limitation, if adopted, should apply to the average annual expenditure during the period of the Convention, i.e., up to the 31st December, 1936, instead of the four yearly period proposed by the budgetary experts. Of course, if France and Italy do not arrive at a Naval agreement satisfactory to us, we should claim to exercise our rights under Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty, which might involve considerable expenditure. It must be admitted that the success of the Naval Conference in 1935 would be liable to be jeopardised if the five principal powers had to discuss the question of an over-riding budgetary limitation for each in his own currency, in addition to questions of numbers, tonnages and classes of ships.79. Although Article 33 of the Draft Convention refers to publicity rather than to limitation, we take this opportunity of stating our agreement with the budgetary experts in opposing the proposal in that article, that there should be a yearly statement showing by categories of materials the total annual expenditure on the upkeep, purchase and manufacture of war materials of the land and sea armed forces. It may be ad!ded that this question was not discussed by the Preparatory Commission so far as the war material of the sea armed forces is concerned. Indeed, the Drafting Committee that prepared the Draft Disarma-ment Convention on the basis of the actual discussions omitted the words &quot; and I sea,&quot; which were inserted without discussion at the proof stage of the Draft Convention.Question raised 80.   It should be noted that any disequilibrium between (a) the numericalby Denunciation iimits applying to men and material, and (6) a budgetary limitation figure would ,,r&quot;c&apos; (I&apos;J!&quot;&apos; also raise important issues in connection with obligations under the Covenant ofthe League and the Denunciation Cl.anse* of the Disarmament Convention. Under the Covenant (Article 8), it is laid down that after the adoption of limits, such limits &quot; shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council,&quot; that is, the unanimous consent of the Council. It follows that upward revision of any initial limiting figures would be a matter of great difficulty and, as regards Air Force limits, probably out of the question, since Germany has a permanent seat on the Council and, having no Air Force herself, could hardly be expected to agree to any increase in the air armaments of other Powers.   The alternativeOpposition to Idea of Showing annual expenditure by Categories of Materials.* Article 60.
procedure would be to invoke the Denunciation Clause of the Disarmament Convention. Denunciation, however, cannot take effect until after a lapse of two years, and at no time during the period covered by the Convention.This appears to afford an additional reason why it would be quite impracticable-able to accept budgetary limits at a lower relative level than the material limits. Similarly, it would be inadvisable to accept any limits at a level which was likely to prove inadequate at a later date.81. The Sub-Committee in their practical examination of the Three Party Resolutions would now like to turn to the remaining sentences of Resolution 6, where it is stated that &quot; The Delegates should aim at the application, mutatis mutandis, of similar principles to the general reduction and limitation of armaments, and should support the principle that the same methods of disarmament should be applied to all nations alike. This should not involve the increase of the fighting strength of the disarmed Powers, but rather the reduction of the armaments of others. The elimination, or limitation, as the case may be, of weapons, as provided in the Peace Treaties is important and should be pressed by our delegates as generally applicable. The system of supervision accepted in the Disarmament Treaty, which should be on some such lines as those proposed in the draft Convention, shoidd replace the methods of supervision in the Peace Treaty.&quot;82. In the first place, the Sub-Committee would like to draw attention to the forms of limitation and restriction which were imposed on Germany under Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. As regards the Army, the strength was definitely limited to seven divisions of infantry and three divisions of cavalry, having a total effective strength, including officers and establishments of depots, not exceeding 100,000 men. It was further stipulated that this force was to be devoted exclusively to the maintenance of order within German territory and the control of German frontiers. Within this grand total the total number of officers permitted was also specified.83. Further restrictions were added which included the abolition of conscription and the introduction of a voluntary system, together with the stipulation that all effectives must serve on long-period engagements in order to avoid rapidly passing through the army a large number of personnel. There were numerous other restrictions as regards staff, and so on. The armament which this force was allowed was strictly specified, the maximum numbers being given for rifles, carbines, machine guns, trench mortars, 7-7-c.m. guns and 10-5 cm. howitzers, which were the largest sizes permitted. Further, the largest number of rounds which might be maintained for rifles or guns were definitely specified. As regards war material, its manufacture was strictly limited under conditions specified, and anything surplus had to be destroyed or handed over to the Allies.   No tanks or armoured vehicles were permitted.84. Provisions were included to prevent or to attempt to prevent the organisation&apos; of what might be called formations organised on a military basis, i.e., voluntary organisations bearing any sort of military character.85.   All field works, fortresses, &amp;c, on the Rhine were ordered to be dismantled and not rebuilt.86. The Naval clauses made provision for the number of ships that might Provisions of be maintained in commission, which amounted to six armoured vessels, six light Naval Clauses, cruisers, 12 destroyers and twelve torpedo boats. No submarines were to be allowed at all. The right of replacement of these vessels was allowed, but it was specified that for armoured ships the displacement must not exceed 10,000 tons, for light cruisers 6,000 tons, for destroyers 800 tons and torpedo boats 200 tons. The periods of replacement were laid down as being 20 years for armoured vessels and cruisers and 15 years for other types, counting from the launching of the ship.87.   The total effectives for manning the fleet were limited at 15,000, and within this total the number of Officers and Warrant Officers was also limited.Restrictions Imposed on Germanv by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles.Provisions ofMilitaryClauses.
88. The recruitment of personnel for the Navy was to be on a voluntary basis and on long-term engagements, as in the case of the Army, and provision was also made to prevent the formation of any official or unofficial reserves in so far as was possible. All surplus stocks, ships and other armaments were either to be destroyed or handed over to the Allies.89. The German Military and Naval Air Forces were entirely abolished, and the only aviation permitted in Germany is civil aviation.90. It is desired to point out, in the first place, that the restrictions imposed on Germany were only made possible because Germany had just been defeated and was confronted with overwhelming forces; and also because a system of most rigid and far-reaching inspection was introduced. It involved, in fact, the granting of permission to vast commissions of control to tour Germany at will and to demand the production of any evidence which they thought they might require.91. It is not supposed for one moment that such a form of rigid inspection would be tolerated by any country not in the position in which Germany found herself in 1918; and if it is accepted as a sine qua non that the imposition of the limitations imposed on Germany would have been ineffective without these commissions of control, then it may, perhaps, be contended that any attempt to impose some of the drastic limitations without a system of intolerable super-vision are likely to be abortive.92. It is implied in this resolution of the Three Party Committee that the aim of the Disarmament Convention should be to effect reductions and limitations on the lines of those just described. As regards the practical application of such a proposal, the Sub-Committee would like to offer certain comments. To take first of all the case of the Navy. It is well known that the imposition of the restrictions in the Treaty of Versailles resulted in the production of what is known as the pocket battleship, and it is understood that the design of this vessel is only the logical outcome of these artificial restrictions. However this may be, the result at present is that there exist in the world two separate forms of limitation for naval forces, i.e., those embodied in the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and those embodied in the Treaty of Versailles; and these two separate forms are, unfortunately, not coincident.93. So far as this country is concerned, it is understood that the production of the pocket battleship does not cause us any immediate concern, though it is conceivable that circumstances might arise in which we should be compelled to initiate construction to meet this particular kind of vessel; but the effect of this pocket battleship has been noticeable in France, and it has undoubtedly created a feeling of nervousness and a tendency to demand the construction of additional vessels capable of combating what is alleged to be a new naval menace.94. The Admiralty have suggested that it is obviously wrong that there should be these two forms of limitation, which rather tend to cut across each other, and that since one form of limitation has inspired the creation of a special design of ship, it is preferable to take some action to prevent the recurrence of this phenomenon, and they would be perfectly prepared to abrogate the Naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and to bring the German Navy on to the same category basis as the London Naval and Washington Treaties. It is emphasised that this proposal is in no way intended to imply that Germany would be given the right to build up to the limits allowed to the other Naval Powers under these Treaties, but that their categories of ships should be governed by the same limits as are laid down in these Treaties, and the actual numbers and tonnage of vessels should be a, matter for decision at the Conference.95. The Sub-Committee are of opinion that it is desirable there should be one standard of limitation of navies throughout the world, and that on this basis it would be preferable to bring Germany into the London and Washington Treaty system rather than to attempt either to graft the Treaty of Versailles on to these Treaties, or alternatively to scrap these Treaties and attempt to bring all countries in on the same basis as the Treaty of Versailles. It is further thought that this suggestion need not in any way reflect adversely on any proposals for the reduction in the size of capital ships or other war vessels. It must be admitted, however, that there has not been the least indication during theProvisions of Air Clauses.Question of Supervision.Possibility of Applying these Restrictions at theDisarmament Conference.Difficulties of having Two Separate Systems of Naval Limitation.
discussions connected with the Washington and London Naval Treaties or the Geneva Draft Disarmament Convention, that other maritime Powers of standing would agree to accept the limitations (e.g., as to size of ships or submarines) that have been imposed on Germany.96. The Admiralty have always been most strongly in favour of the Abolition of abolition of submarines, and in this their views coincide with one of the provisions Submarines, of the Treaty of Versailles. As is well known, however, considerable opposition has always been encountered to this proposal, particularly from France and Japan. This opposition has been based primarily on the fact that these two countries maintain that the submarine is essentially a defensive weapon, whereas it is our contention that it is essentially an offensive one. To carry out the spirit of resolution 6, however, it is suggested that it is worth considering whether or not this proposal should be again advanced.97.   To turn next to the question of the limitation of land armaments.   With Application the limitation of personnel no comments would appear to be necessary, the crux of Land the matter being the actual possibilities of obtaining definite reductions in the Armaments. sizes of the various armies of the world.   There is, however, the question of conscription, but as this question is considered in detail under Resolution 7, no further comment is necessary.98. Turning now to the question of land war material, attention is drawn to the fact that at present no direct numerical limitation has been included in the Draft Convention, nor is there contained therein any suggestion to abolish parti-cular weapons. It has been shown that, in the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not permitted any guns exceeding 6-inch in calibre and only a very limited number of this type, and that she was not allowed any tanks or armoured cars. The point for consideration, therefore, is whether these prohibitions applied to Germany can be made universal in application.99. It might be mentioned in this connection also that suggestions have been put forward that it would be of great advantage to secure the abolition of all offensive weapons, if it should be found possible and practicable to make any distinction between offensive and defensive armaments. As we have already stated in paragraph 29 of our Report, the Chiefs of Staff haA^e considered this question, and have definitely stated that no such distinction can be drawn. A paper was also laid before the Three Party Committee on the question of the limitation of tanks and heavy guns (Paper No. D.C. (P.) 43), and this subject has also formed part of a report of the Committee of Imperial Defence in connection with the consideration of the Draft Disarmament Convention (C.I.D. Paper No. 1016-B). The particular paragraph to Avhich reference has just been made reads as follows :  &quot; The technical difficulties in the Avay of effective limitation even of those larger weapons seem very great, and on the Avhole the advantage of limiting them AArould not be of great importance. We do not, therefore, recommend that Ave should put it forward, though Ave might accept a suitable and practicable proposal if put forAvard by others.&quot;100. As regards heavy guns, any proposed limitation could hardly be restricted to land war material. In many cases guns are interchangeable as between the land and naval services, and the limitation of heavy guns, to be effective, would, therefore, have to be applied also to naval and coast defence guns, Avhich, in some countries, are under the Navy. Further, it is generally admitted that any restrictions could hardly be made effective Avithout some system of control such as Avas imposed on Germany, and this reason alone must rule anySUch nTYvnnfifilc: nut. nf pniirt.j.---j.---------- ------101. The difficulties of limiting tanks are chiefly of a technical nature. In the first place, it is extremely difficult to define a tank or to differentiate it from armoured lorries or from small armoured machines used to carry messengers, machine guns, artillery, &amp;c, or from armoured track ambulances for the evacuation of Avounded. It is the contention of the War Office that the tank is &quot;ot actually a Aveapon, but a definite stage in military evolution, and that it would be just as reasonable to suggest the reintroduction of Avooden ships for the Navy as to propose to abolish tanks. Further, that the tank is definitely a We-saving weapon, and to cut out tanks is, in effect, to keep war barbarous and
to repeat the sacrifices of human life in the last war. Further, that if any limitation of tanks is to be imposed, a limitation must also be made to machine guns, to which the tank is the logical answer, for the former are the weapons which dominate the battlefield to-day.102. This question has already been dealt with in previous paragraphs of this report, and need not be elaborated here. It is hoped, however, that the difficulties in the way of imposing a limitation on these weapons may be appreciated, although it is realised that their abolition represents an ideal of considerable value.Application to 103.    Finally, to consider the question of air forces.   Under the Treaty of&apos; &apos; 1 Versailles, as has been shown, Germany was prohibited from maintainingany air force of a military character. The direct result of this limitation has shown itself in a huge expansion of German civil aviation. Partly, no doubt, this expansion would have occurred normally by reason of the very favourable situation in which Germany is placed, both internally and externally, as regards air routes; but there is little doubt that, if some of the energies which have been put into civil aviation had been available for the development of military aviation, the former would not be in such a flourishing condition at the present time.104. The relation between military and civil aviation is close and there is little doubt that the efficiency of the civil aviation organisation of any country will have a direct bearing on that country&apos;s air efficiency in war and, in particular, on its productive capacity. In other words, it is unavoidable that civil aviation, as regards machines, personnel, equipment and manufacturing ability, should represent a definite war value.105. The abolition of all military aircraft would react greatly to the detriment of this country. For physical and geographical reasons, it is improbable that we shall ever have a very large internal civil aviation organisa-tion; whereas countries on the Continent and in America have all the scope which the restricted size of this country denies to us. It would seem that history would be likely to repeat itself if military air forces were abolished, and the energies of all countries would be diverted to the creation and maintenance of a big civil air force. We should therefore find ourselves in a position of inferiority which it would hardly be reasonable to contemplate, having regard to the fact that, in the absence of military aircraft, civil aircraft could easily be converted to military use, and having further regard to the important point that, while civil aircraft can be adapted easily for aggressive purposes, they are, by reason of their general characteristics, quite unsuited for the work of defence.106. It has been suggested in some quarters that the abolition of national air forces might be rendered possible by the constitution of an international air force under the League of Nations. The difficulties of constituting, maintaining efficiently and using properly and effectively such a force seem at the present moment to be insuperable. In order to meet the contentions that, if military air forces are abolished, civil aviation will become of increasing importance from a military point of view, it has been proposed that civil aviation should be inter-nationalised. The difficulties of effectively implementing any such proposal when it is at all closely examined appear insuperable. Moreover, it could not in any event nullify the inherent advantages which would remain with those countries in which the largest civil aviation organisations and industries were located.107. Finally, in this resolution the question of supervision is raised. What is contemplated under the Draft Convention is the creation of a permanent disarmament commission, whose functions would be to examine all the returns made, to point out any deficiencies or apparent defections, and, if necessary, to call witnesses. Any cases of defection thus brought to light would be reported to the High Contracting Parties and to the Council of the League for action. In other words, the system is not one of supervision, such as was carried out by Commissions of Control after the war or even such as is outlined in Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, which provided for investigation by the League; but rather more of reliance on the good faith of the countries concerned, coupled with the right to require any State whose returns might, onSystem of ControlProposed under Disarmament Convention.
9 -f aArmaments.Resolution 7.&quot; The Delegates should reaffirm our desire to see conscription abolished. If, as is probable, its abolition should prove impossible, other methods must be found for the limitation of effective strengths of land and air personnel and consequently their reserves.&quot;109.   From the previous attitude of all States who employ the conscription Abolition of system and were present at the Preparatory Commission, it appears inevitable Conscription, that our desire to see conscription abolished will not  in fact prevail.   It is (necessary, therefore, to consider other methods.110. Owing to devotion to an alleged democratic principle nearly all States [having conscription insist upon enrolling practically every available man in their forces. It may be expected that the majority will continue to adhere to ithis principle. It is, in fact, perfectly possible either by ballot or by a large [number of exemptions and a high physical standard to restrict the numbers actually called to the Colours without vitiating the principle of &quot; Egalite,&quot; and such methods are followed in some States. It is unlikely, however, that we shall succeed in getting any of these devices for limiting the annual contingent generally accepted.111. The existing number of trained reserves available on mobilization cannot, for obvious reasons, be limited or reduced. They are civilians in civil life with military training, and are therefore available. The numbers could, however, be reduced in the future by limiting the annual intake and thus reducing the number of men passing to the Reserve year by year. This is unlikely to be accepted, as is pointed out above.112.   As it is unlikely that we shall be able to get agreement on the question Methods of of limiting the numbers of the annual contingents, we are compelled to fall back Limiting upon another method, that is to limit their efficiency, both while with the Colours ^^oript and while in the Reserve.   This can be done in the following ways :  &quot; tmies&apos;(a) The period of service of the contingent and the periods of reservist training can be reduced to a level such as prevails in the Swiss Army to-day, which would convert the Army to nothing more than a Militia. There is no sign at present of any intention on the part of the more important military Powers to reduce their periods of service to this level.(b) It has been found that when the period of service is reduced there is a tendency to compensate for it by increasing the long-service personnel. This, if carried to considerable lengths, is really an expensive device to redress the loss of efficiency caused by the reduction in the period of service. It follows, therefore, that there should be a limitation in the number of long-service personnel, if not also a budgetary limitation.(c) Upon the number of regular and reserve officers must depend the size of the Army on mobilization. It will therefore tend to reduce efficiency if the number of officers and reserve officers is reduced.examination, become suspect, to justify them before the Commission and, failing satisfactory explanations, to report such alleged defections to the Council. Such a system would appear generally to be unobj ectionable, but it is desired to point out that the Service Departments would all have the greatest objections to any form of supervision which implied right of visits of inspection.108. There is one further point which, perhaps, might be mentioned and Restrictions on that is the restrictions placed on the manufacture of armaments in Germany. Manufacture of [Logically speaking, any system of limitation of war materials should imply also la restriction of factory output in proportion to the armaments permitted, leaving ,aside any question of exports. Here again, however, it is obviously impossible to ensure that the factory output is related to first-line strength without a system of rigid inspection, and even with such a system of inspection possibilities of evasion are obvious and numerous. It is not proposed to go further into this matter in this report beyond emphasising the obvious difficulties connected with such a scheme.
113. Machinery already exists in the Draft Convention for limiting the period of service, the number of long-service personnel and the number of officers, though there is no provision for limiting the number of reserve officers. There is also machinery for limiting the size of the annual contingent, depending on the figures inserted in the Convention.114. It is therefore true to say that the machinery exists for adequate reductions both in the numbers and efficiency of the effectives of. Armies, and success in this matter will depend upon the figures under each heading inserted in the Convention.115. In order to present a fair picture of this problem, however, it might be mentioned that there is a school of thought which holds that the conscript system is a less military system than the voluntary one because it is indiscriminate and represents only a phase in the lives of those who are called to the Colours, Further, that by reason of its all-embracing nature it affects every section of the community, and that in this way a greater public restraint may be imposed on a Government in any warlike enterprise it might contemplate. On this argument it is also stated that a voluntary army represents a far more concentrated essence of militarism because it implies life service in the cause of armaments.116. In conclusion, it may be added that, in arriving at a policy in regard to conscription, consideration should be given to the fact that the question of its abolition has proved one of the most contentious subjects discussed by the Preparatory Commission, and any attempt to re-open these discussions may lead to some bitterness of feeling, and may, also, impair such agreement as has already been reached with so much labour in the draft Disarmament Convention.Objections to giving Publicity to Reserves of Material.Resolution 8.&quot; Full information be published.&quot;as   to  reserves  of  men  and  material   should117. This question of disclosing reserves of material* was discussed in some detail by the Three Party Committee, and although grave objections were raised to the principle by the three Chiefs of Staff, it was finally agreed, on political grounds, that the object was so desirable that military objections must be over-ruled. Considerable opposition to the principle of publicity as regards reserved of material was also manifested by several of the Principal Powers during the discussions at the Preparatory Commission at Geneva.118.   The chief objection to this form of publicity, from our point of view,1 is that in the last ten years for reasons of economy we have let the reserves of material of all three Services reach a dangerously low level, so dangerous in fact, that it was only because their state was kept secret from the rest of the world that the three Chiefs of Staff were willing to accept the position.119. This being the case, the Chiefs of Staff informed the Three Party Committee that, if it were seriously intended to put forward such a proposal, they would feel it their duty to ask immediately that the strengths of these reserves be brought up to reasonable proportions. On the other hand it has been urged that the disclosure of grave deficiencies in reserves would serve as a very valuable earnest of our pacific intentions, and that any country which showed that their reserves were maintained at a very high level would expose itself to the charge of making active preparations for war. It has also been urged that, at the stage which we have now reached in the organisation of peace and the repression of wanton aggression, the disclosure of inadequate stocks would not imperil the country making the disclosure.120. This is a matter, however, which even more than usual, would depend on the good faith of the various Powers, and it could not be denied that the opportunities for concealment wrould be many and easy.121. It would seem, therefore, that although such publicity might demonstrate in striking form the peaceful intentions of this country, the risks of abuse in actual practice more than counterbalance any advantages that we-* There has been no definition of material for this purpose.
might get, and the dangers to which this country might be exposed, if other countries deliberately acted against the spirit of this resolution would be very much greater than those to which we have voluntarily exposed ourselves in the-interests of economy.Resolution 9.&quot; The Delegates should keep in view throughout the idea of gradually leading nations to rely for their security on the obligations undertaken by all the nations of the Conference to renounce war as an instrument of policy and to seek the settlement of disputes by none but peace fid means. Until these engagements are accepted at their face value disarmament can never be complete.&quot;122. This resolution is of a political character, and the Committee therefore have no comments to offer.Summary.123. The following is a summary of the principal points of importance discussed in the body of this report: Introduction.   (Paragraphs 1-8.)(i) The basis of the report is the Three Party Committee&apos;s resolutions, with special attention to the question of budgetary limitation and certain points of importance or interest connected with preparations for the Disarmament Conference, especially the need for early consultation with the other Members of the British Commonwealth.Preamble to Resolutions.   (Paragraphs 9-11.)(ii) It is assumed that the Three Party resolutions are intended for the confidential information and guidance of the United Kingdom Delegation, and that they will not be published.Resolution 1.   (Paragraph 12.)(iii) Political issues are raised in this resolution with which the Sub-Committee are not competent to deal.Resolution 2.   (Paragraphs 13-17.)(iv) It is thought to be essential to make, at the Conference, a full statement of the reductions already effected by the United Kingdom.   (Paragraph 13.)(v) Since the size of our armed forces has been reduced to a level which, in the opinion of the Service Departments, is in some directions incompatible with the needs of national security and the world-wide commitments and responsi-bilities of the United Kingdom, it is suggested that our aim should be to try and persuade other nations to reduce their forces down towards our levels. Only after these reductions have been made could any reductions by us be considered. (Paragraphs 14-16.)(vi) While it is possible that, if other PoAvers fail to effect satisfactory reductions, aa&apos;e might have to contemplate some increases, it is thought that the time and place for any pronouncement of this kind would need careful choosing. (Paragraph 17.)Resolution 3.   (Paragraphs 18-26.)(vii) The ideals Avhich inspired this resolution appear to be difficult to apply in practice, because it can never be possible to provide that a small State shall have adequate security against a large one, except of course by a system of mutual guarantees (e.g., the French security thesis).   (Paragraphs 18-21.)(viii) A reduction of armaments might invoke either :  (a) An alteration in the relative levels of armaments; or(b) An all-round equal percentage reduction from existing figures.Of these two proposals the former appears to be most in accord with the spirit of this resolution.   (Paragraphs 22-23.)
(ix) While the holding of successive Disarmament Conferences will probably be found to be necessary, it is thought that the intervals between each Conference should not be too short-a suitable period might be the 10 years contemplated in the Covenant. An exception to this rule will be necessary, however, in respect of any naval agreements, which should be co-terminous with the Washington and London Naval Treaties.   (Paragraphs 24-25.)(x) It is noted that apprehension exists in some of the Dominions lest the Conference might stabilise armaments at their existing levels, irrespective of the circumstance of each State, and thus preclude any opportunity of a young country ultimately acquiring forces for its defence commensurate with its national security.   (Paragraph 26.)Resolution 4.   (Paragraph 27.)(xi) The Sub-Committee realise that, in any attempt to fix relative levels, regard must be had to the political, geographical and international circumstances of a country, and that in no case more than our own does this essential principle apply.Resolution 5.   (Paragraphs 28-29.)(xii) The Chiefs of Staff have reported definitely that it is not possible to draw any hard and fast distinction between offensive and defensive weapons. This report confirms the unanimous finding of a sub-commission of the League.Resolution 6.   (Paragraphs 30-108.)(xiii) As regards Budgetary Limitation, the Draft Convention provides : (a) for limitation of total expenditure on the Defence Services (Article 29).(The Budgetary Experts Committee reported that, from a technicalaspect, it was feasible to limit separately the total expenditure ineach of the three services.) (6) within this total for limitation of expenditure upon land war material(Article 10) and also upon naval war material (Article 24).It has been stated at Geneva that, so far as the Navy is concerned, limitation of naval expenditure could only be accepted if it is also accepted by the other principal naval Powers. No Budgetary Limitation was proposed in the Draft Convention for air war material.(xiv) The attitude of the Services vis-a-vis the Budgetary Limitation -situation, as will be seen in the ensuing sub-paragraphs, is as follows :- (a) The Admiralty can only accept Budgetary Limitation subject to the reservation referred to in sub-paragraph (xiii) above, and do not wish to extend the application of this principle.(b) The War Office desire to see Budgetary Limitation applied separatelyto each of the three services.(c) The Air Ministry are opposed to the application of the principle of budgetary Limitation, and in particular to any extension of its application to Air Forces.(xv) The supporters of Budgetary Limitation urge that it is necessary as a supplement to quantitative limitation to act as a check on the production of more highly scientific and more destructive weapons. They hold that quantitative limitation only might not be sufficient to prevent a competition in armaments, (jraitigiajjUS oi-uu.](xvi) The Labour Cabinet supported the system of Budgetary Limitation in principle, and have publicly pronounced in its favour at Geneva.  (Paragraph 34.)(xvii) Budgetary Limitation is understood by the Sub-Committee to be a supplementary device intended to prevent development within the numerical limits accepted, of more costly and destructive weapons. It should be directly related to the quantitative Treaty figures which, in the case of the Navy, are represented by the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and in the case of the Army and Air Force remain to be settled by negotiations at the Conference. It is understood that Budgetary Limitation does not mean limitation to actual
existing estimate figures plus, say, a small margin for contingencies, and any attempt to enforce such a relation would cut clean across existing datum line Treaties and would prove wholly unacceptable to the Service Departments. As regards the question of margins, it is emphasised that by margin is meant the difference between the actual current estimates and the Budgetary Limitation figures which will be calculated on the basis of the numerical limitation figures.   (Paragraphs 35-45.)(xviii) Proposals have been put forward at various times suggesting as an effective measure of disarmament a 25 per cent, all round budgetary cut. This proposal, it is believed, is based on a misconception of the system of Budgetary Limitation as described in sub-paragraph (xvii) above. If applied it would have the effect of abrogating existing Limitation Treaties and would penalise most severely those countries which have been keeping their armament.expenditure down to the lowest levels.   (Paragraph 46.)(xix) The Admiralty emphasise that Budgetary Limitation should only be accepted in respect of our naval forces if related directly to the numerical limitations imposed in the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and consequently that any Budgetary figure accepted for our naval forces would have to be computed on the basis of enabling us (a) To build up as quickly as practicable to the limits allowed by theWashington and London Naval Treaties should such action be necessary.(b) To man fully the ships as they are built as well as existing ships.   (Atpresent many of our ships, as a matter of economy, are only partially manned.)(c) To equip the ships with a full allowance of ammunition.  (The allowanceshave been temporarily reduced as a matter of economy.)(cl) To retain full liberty adequately to replace reserves or develop auxiliary services even though, as a matter of economy, such action is not being taken at present. This is of especial importance on account of the operation of the 10 years&apos; peace assumption under which our reserves have inevitably fallen behind-hand.(e) To complete the Singapore Base at any time it might be so desired.The Admiralty further emphasise that, although this country is maintaining at present the strength of its naval forces considerably below that allowed by the Naval Treaties, such action should not be interpreted in any way as abrogating the right to construct up to the full Treaty limits.   (Paragraphs 47-50.)(xx) The Admiralty do not advise acceptance of the Budgetary Experts7 proposal that there should be an undertaking not to exceed in any year the average of a four yearly period by more than a fixed percentage, because this might mean inability to build up to Treaty limits, and they ask for complete freedom of action at any time within these limits.   (Paragraph 51.)(xxi) The War Office have always been convinced of the necessity of the limitation of the total expenditure on land forces, owing to the extreme difficulty of getting any other satisfactory and effective method for limiting land arma-ments. It is urged that, so long as the total military expenditure is limited, no State would be able to indulge in a competition of armaments in respect of land forces. They are further of the opinion that Budgetary Limitation should be applied to each Service separately.   (Paragraphs 52-53.)(xxii) Budgetary Limitation is the only form of limitation that has been accepted at Geneva for application to land war material, and this principle has also been accepted by the Cabinet.   (Paragraph 54.)(xxiii) It is not recommended that coast defence expenditure should be included in the Admiralty vote as is proposed by the Committee of Budgetary Experts, since this is opposed to current practice in this country whereby fixed coast defence expenditure is an army responsibility. It is further urged that from all points of view it would be undesirable to bind ourselves, financially or otherwise, in such a way as might prevent us from completing the modernisation of our coast defences.   (Paragraph 55.)(xxiv) The question of the margin between the Army Estimate figure and the Budgetary Limitation figure has been reserved by the Army Council for consideration only by higher authority.   (Paragraph 56.)
(xxv) The Air Ministry have always opposed the principle of Budgetary Limitation though they have supported the idea of full Budgetary Publicity. They consider that the Budgetary Limitation figures will inevitably become a standard of international comparison, and that, whereas under Budgetary Publicity any substantial increase in expenditure could be challenged, under Budgetary Limitation this will not be the case so long as the agreed totals are not exceeded. Furthermore, they point out that no country could accept a Budgetary limit which did not give liberty to provide armaments at the level determined by the limitation upon men and material, and that, in. addition, &quot;margins &quot; for unforeseen circumstances would be claimed. The result would be that the Budgetary Limitation figure would be in excess of requirements, .and consequently would not act as a restriction.  (Paragraph 57.)(xxvi) The Air Ministry point out that to apply Budgetary Limitation to the Air Forces would lead inevitably to complications in regard to civil aviation since most countries&apos; expenditure on civil aviation is organically inseparable from their expenditure on military aviation. This being so, it is suggested that a powerful factor in any future Avar would be unrestricted, and they urge, further, that increased expenditure on air armaments does not necessarily imply an increase of aggressive forces, but often represents expenditure in achieving increased safety.   (Paragraph 58.)(xxvii) The Air Ministry entirely concur with the point made by the Admiralty that they must have complete freedom within the Budgetary Limitation figure imposed, to build up or maintain adequate reserves. This point is of particular importance to the Air Ministry because, for reasons of economy, very little provision has been made for war reserves.   (Paragraph 59.)(xxviii) A summary of the attitude of the Service Departments to Budgetary Limitation is contained in paragraphs 61-63. The Treasury desires to reserve judgment regarding the value or desirability of applying Budgetary Limitation until it is in a position to- examine the margins which the Service Departments consider should be allowed between their Budgetary Limitation figure and their Estimate figure.   (Paragraph 64.)(xxix) &apos;&apos; Virement&apos;&apos; means the right to transfer sums within a global total from one Service to another; the question can only arise if it should be decided that separate limitations should be set for each of the three Services. The question of its application to naval and land war material, which it is proposed to limit separately, was not considered by the Budgetary Experts&apos; Committee. (Paragraph 65.)(xxx) The question of policy to be decided is whether it is desirable that a country having agreed a total of armaments expenditure should be allowed to develop one service at the expense of either or both the others, thus possibly upsetting the equilibrium at which the Disarmament Conference will aim. (Paragraph 66.)(xxxi) The Budgetary Experts suggested two methods of achieving a limited degree of &quot; virement &quot;; if, as is suggested in this report, the global total is built up by adding agreed separate totals for each service, then the Budgetary Experts&apos; second proposal limitation by an agreed percentage would seem to follow, if the principle is accepted at all.   (Paragraphs 67-68.)(xxxii) It is understood that certain nations will press for right of &quot;virement&quot; for domestic reasons, or as a matter of principle. The question of margins is also of importance, because if the margin is large between the Budgetary Limitation figure and actual expenditure &quot; virement &quot; becomes of less importance; whereas, if the margin is low, States might well demand a degree of elasticity that might be undesirable. The opinion of the Service Departments on this question varies. The Admiralty and the War Office oppose it and the Air Ministry favour it.   (Paragraphs 69-70.)(xxxiii) It is necessary also to consider how Budgetary Limitation, if accepted, could be applied to the Pleets of the several Members of the Common-wealth. These Fleets were taken together at the London Naval Conference for the purpose of quantitative limitation on the understanding that the practical allocation of the tonnage as between the several Members of the Commonwealth was a domestic matter.   (Paragraph 71.)(xxxiv) This question was considered briefly at the Imperial Conference, and three possible solutions were put forward, the advantages and disadvantages of each being indicated.  The matter is one of some urgency and it is suggested that
consultation should take place with the Dominions at an early date. It is possible that the War Office and Air Ministry may be concerned to some extent in this question.   (Paragraphs 72-77.)(xxxv) If budgetary limitation should be applied to the navy it would be necessary to arrange that its application should be coterminous with the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and that its continuance would have to be negotiated at the same time as the prolongation of those Treaties. Further, if adopted, it should apply to the average naval expenditure during the period of the Convention up to the 31st December, 1936, instead of the four-yearly periods proposed by the Budgetary Experts. Regard must also be had to the possibility of having to implement our rights under Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty.   (Paragraph 78.)(xxxvi) The Sub-Committee support the opinion of the Committee of Budgetary Experts that there should not be a yearly statement, showing by categories of materials the total annual expenditure on the up-keep, purchase and manufacture of wrar materials of land and sea armed forces.   (Paragraph 79.)(xxxvii) It would appear inadvisable and impracticable to accept any budgetary limits at a lower relative level than the material limits; for, in addition to the reasons already given in sub-paragraph (xvii) of this summary, it would appear to be impossible to obtain any increase, once the Convention is signed, without the unanimous consent of the Council or without invoking the Denunciation Clause of the Convention, which, however, cannot take effect until after a lapse of two years and, in any case, at no time during the period covered by the Convention.   (Paragraph 80.)(xxxviii) A detailed description of the military clauses contained in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles will be found in paragraphs 81-89.(xxxix) It is considered to be impossible to attempt to impose any form of supervision such as was imposed on Germany after the war. The restrictions were workable only because Germany had just been defeated, and was confronted with overwhelming forces, and because a system of rigid and far-reaching inspection was introduced. Such a system would obviously be intolerable to any States in a normal position.   (Paragraphs 90-91.)(xl) In considering the possibility of applying the restrictions under Part V of the Treaty of Versailles in the Disarmament Convention, the Admiralty wish to point out that there exist to-day two separate methods of limiting naval vessels, i.e., those under the Treaty of Versailles and those under the Washington and London Naval Treaties, and that these two separate forms of limitation are not co-incident. It appears to the Admiralty undesirable that these two separate forms of limitation should continue, and they suggest that Germany should be brought on to the category basis of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. (Paragraphs 92-95.)(xli) The Admiralty are still strongly in favour of the abolition of submarines; their views thus coincide with one of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The opposition of France and Japan to this proposal is well known, but to carry out the spirit of Resolution 6, it is suggested that it is worth while considering further whether to advance this proposal again or not. (Paragraph 96.)(xiii) No comments are made on the proposal to apply the same personnel limits to other countries as are applied to Germany, but the question of conscription is considered in detail under Resolution 7. The point is considered as to whether it might be possible to apply certain of the limitations imposed on Germany to other countries (e.g., the abolition of big guns and tanks), despite tne fact that no numerical limitation for land war material is proposed in the Draft Convention. The Chiefs of Staff have reported, however, on the impracticability of drawing any hard and fast distinction between offensive and defensive weapons, and the War Office are of the opinion that it is impossible to limit or prohibit big guns and tanks without a system of supervision which would prove intolerable. It is further pointed out that it is extremely difficult to define a tank, and that, if it was proposed to limit or abolish this weapon, it would also be necessary to limit or abolish machine guns, to which the tank is a logical answer. It is finally pointed out that the tank is definitely designed to save life, and that it would be unsound to abolish a weapon having this characteristic. (Paragraphs 97-102.)
(xliii) The result of prohibiting air forces to Germany has been to foster to some extent the expansion of German civil aviation. Since the relation between military and civil aviation is close, the efficiency of the latter organisation must have a direct bearing on a country &apos;s efficiency for war, especially on its productive capacity. The abolition of all military aircraft would, therefore, react greatly to the detriment of this country, because for physical and geographical reasons it is improbable that we shall ever have a large internal civil aviation organisation, at any rate, comparable with countries on the Continent, or America. Further-more, since civil aircraft can be used quite easily for aggressive military purposes, but, by reason of their characteristics, are quite unsuitable for work of defence, the handicap under which this country might suffer would be greatly increased. (Paragraphs 103-105.)(xliv) It has been suggested that the abolition of national air forces might be rendered possible by the constitution of an international air force under the League of Nations, or, further, that civil aviation might be internationalized if military aviation was abolished, to avoid the difficulties described in the pre-ceding paragraph. It is pointed out that the obstacles in the way of constituting, maintaining efficiently, and using properly and effectively any such force, would seem to be insuperable, and in any international civil aviation proposal it is inevitable that this country would come off badly, because of the small size of our organisation, compared with those of other countries.    (Paragraph 106.)(xlv) The system contemplated under the Draft Convention envisages the creation of a Permanent Disarmament Commission, whose functions would be to examine the returns, point out deficiencies or apparent defections, or, if necessary, to call witnesses to justify any of the figures submitted. Should any cases of apparent defection from the Convention be disclosed, they would be reported by the Commission to the Council of the League, who would take such action as seemed appropriate. Although such a system generally appears to be unobjectionable, the Service Departments emphasize that they would have the gravest objections to any form of supervision which implied the right of visits of inspection.    (Paragraph 107.)(xlvi) Severe restrictions were placed on the manufacture of armaments in Germany, but, here again, it is remarked that it is obviously impossible to ensure that the factory output is related to the first-line strength without a system of&apos; rigid inspection, and that even then, as experience in Germany has shown, possibilities of evasion are obvious and numerous. Any attempts at limitation in this direction are, it is thought, likely not only to be abortive, but to promote international ill-feeling.   (Paragraph 108.)Resolution 7.   (Paragraphs 109-116.)(xlvii) The difficulties in the way of, and the objections of Continental nations to, the abolition of the conscription system are set out, but it is shown that machinery exists in the Draft Convention for limiting the period of service, the number of long-service personnel and the number of officers, and also for limiting the size of the annual contingent. If these proposals are accepted, there is no doubt that reductions in both numbers and efficiency of the effectives of armies could be achieved, provided the figures under each head inserted in the Convention are reasonable. In coming to any decision as to whether or not again to press for the abolition of conscription, it is suggested that consideration should be given to the fact that this point has proved one of the most contentious discussed by the Preparatory Commission, and that any attempt to reopen it might lead to-bitterness, and might even impair such agreement as has already been reached.Resolution 8.   (Paragraphs 117-121.)(xlviii) The Three Party Committee, despite grave objections raised by the three Chiefs of Staff, agreed on political grounds that it was desirable to publish full information as to reserves of men and material. The Chiefs of Staff pointed out that the objection to this form of publicity as regards material was that, during the last ten years, for reasons of economy, Ave have let the reserves of material of all the three Services reach a dangerously Ioav leArel; so dangerous, in fact, that it was only because their state Avas kept secret that the Chiefs of Staff accepted the position.   (Paragraphs 117-118.)
(xlix), The Chiefs of Staff informed the Three Party Committee that if it was seriously intended to put forward such a proposal about material they would feel compelled to ask immediately for the strengths of reserves to be brought up to reasonable proportions. It has been suggested that such publicity might be of advantage to us, in that it would demonstrate strikingly our peaceful intentions, but it is felt that the risks of abuse in actual practice are so great, that any apparent advantage we might get as regards our pacific spirit would be completely counterbalanced by the clangers to which we might be exposed if other countries failed to carry out their undertakings.   (Paragraphs 119-121.)Resolution 9.   (Paragraph 122.)(1) This resolution being of a political character, the Sub-Committee have made no comment.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee, A. CADOGAN (Chairman).(Signed)      E. J. Hodsoll (Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, November 27, 1931.
APPENDIX (A).Report of the Budgetary Experts&apos; Committee. Resume of certain Special Points.(1) Relation between the Return made to the League and the Audited Accounts.IT is desirable that the return made to the League should be based as directly as possible on the Appropriation Accounts, in order that the authenticity of the figures in the return should be evident to all. To do this strictly would, however, entail the opening of a number of fresh Sub-heads in the Appropriation Account, which is deprecated by the Service Departments, both on general grounds and because additional staff might be required. The Service Departments are, how-ever, prepared to utilise the additional ledger headings which they themselves record, but which are not shown in the Appropriation Accounts; for the rest they consider that methods of estimation must be followed, but that such methods will provide all reasonable accuracy.(2) Reconciliation Table.This table is recommended by the Budgetary Experts in order to show precisely how each figure in the return to the League is made up from the published accounts.So far the only countries which have attempted to carry out this proposal in the preliminary returns sent in to the League are the United Kingdom, the Irish Free State, India and Portugal, for a part of her expenditure only. The Departments concerned agree that this procedure is highly desirable and should be pressed by the United Kingdom Delegation.(3) Secret Funds.The Soviet Delegation proposed the insertion of a new article as follows :  &apos;&apos; Secret Punds intended in a disguised form for extraordinary expen-diture on special preparations for war or an increase in armaments shallbe excluded from the national budget.In conformity with the above provision, all expenditure for the upkeepof the armed forces of each State shall be shown in a single chapter of thenational budget; their full publicity shall be ensured.&quot;The intention of this proposal would appear to be that budget accounts should not contain any expenditure under headings Avhich do not exactly indicate the purpose of the expenditure in question; and the Committee of Experts pro-posed to surmount this difficulty by suggesting that the Convention should contain an overriding clause to the effect that the parties to the Convention should give in their returns all expenditure on armaments classified according to its true utilisation.(4) Credits for Armament Purposes.In connection with the question of purchase of armaments on credit, the Budgetary Committee suggested that the parties to the Disarmament Convention should undertake to abstain from (i) The grant of credits to other States in order to enable the latter topurchase armaments, and (ii) The grant of assistance to enterprises in their own countries such as will enable these enterprises to deliver war material on credit to foreign States.A provision of this kind is highly desirable, since, while the United Kingdom does not normally grant such credits or assistance, it is desirable to control the action of other countries in this matter.
It is, however, a question for consideration whether this subject could more properly be dealt with in the Disarmament Convention, or in one of the draft conventions dealing respectively with Traffic in Arms and with the Private Manufacture of Arms.(5) Gross and Net Expenditure.The Budgetary Committee recommended gross expenditure as a basis for the returns to the League, and it is recognised that this conclusion was probably inevitable owing to the budgetary system of other countries.While not objecting to the principle of showing gross expenditure, as pro-posed in the draft annexe, the Committee point out that exceptional cases may arise in which the expenditure may be incurred by one Member of the League on behalf of, and be repaid by another Member. For example, the Admiralty recently incurred considerable expenditure in reconditioning a battleship for Chile. In such an exceptional case power should be reserved to deduct the sum receivedl, as otherwise provision would have to be made for such exceptional expenditure in the limitation figure. A note of any such exceptional cases should appear in the publicity return of the State in question.In the case of the Navy owing to the provisions of the Naval Treaties, all receipts from the Dominions will be deducted from the United Kingdom Naval expenditure.(6) Subsidies, Loans and Participations.The Budgetary Committee recommended that a supplementary return should be made of subsidies to armament firms which had been excluded from the main return on the ground that they were not made for armament purposes.It is understood that general subsidies to industries of all kinds (e.g., the derating scheme) were not intended to be covered by this return.It is possible in theory that such cases may arise in the United Kingdom outside the knowledge of the Service Departments, e.g., through such machinery as that of Trade Facilities Loans or Development Grants or guarantees, and although there appear to be no such cases in existence at present and they are in practice very unlikely to occur, the Treasury will make itself responsible for providing any figures which may be necessary.(7) Fixing of Limits so as to allow for Variation in Expenditure from one year to another.The Budgetary Committee found that in many countries variations in cash expenditure occur from year to year, apart from any change in the level of armaments, and that, owing to the nature of the budgetary system, they cannot be eliminated.  In order to meet this difficulty it recommended (a) That the average expenditure of each four successive years should be kept within the stipulated limit, and(b) That the actual expenditure of any one year should not exceed that limitby more than a percentage to be fixed for each country.We understand that this variation applies both to the total expenditure and to expenditure under Head IV (war material).Three questions arise on this recommendation : (i) The Budgetary Committee probably assumed that the period of the Con-vention would be ten years. If in fact a Convention is entered into for a shorter period, it may be necessary to apply the limit to the average expenditure of a shorter period than four years.(ii) It is not clear whether the intention is that the limit should apply first to the average expenditure on the first to fourth years of the Con-vention, then to the average expenditure of the fifth to eighth years, and so on; or whether-, on the contrary, it is intended to apply to the averages of the first to fourth years, second to fifth years, third to sixth years, and so on.
The first of these alternatives involves the risk that a Power might concentrate its expenditure in the period at the end of one group of years and the beginning of the next, (iii) The question whether there should be a supplementary limit for the expenditure in each individual year (as proposed by the Budgetary Committee under (a) above) gives rise to more difficulty. On the one hand, it seems that a mere system of taking the average expenditure of each period, without any limit on the extent to which this average might be exceeded in any one year, would be very unsatisfactory, first because it might enable a Power to make a rapid increase in its expenditure, and, secondly, because, since any such increase must be followed by a similar decrease in order to preserve the average, and since substantial decreases are in practice difficult to secure, there would probably be a tendency for the limitation of expenditure to break down altogether.On the other hand the Admiralty oppose this supplementary limit on the ground that it would conflict with their right to exercise cat any time any of the options to which they may be entitled under the Washington or London Naval Treaties, and that the supplementary limit would operate to the disadvantage of any country which had refrained from building up to the limits allowed by these Treaties.(8) Fluctuations in the Purchasing Poiuer of Various Currencies.In view of the abandonment of the Gold Standard by the United Kingdom, the Service Departments anticipate that difficulties may arise through a sudden rise of prices occurring at a period of the year which does not allow time to approach the other parties to the Disarmament Convention. The Service Depart-ments express some apprehension that the method of dealing with these difficulties may prove, in practice, too cumbersome.(9) Division of Expenditure between &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and &quot;Formations organised on a Military Basis,&quot; and between those stationed at Home and those stationed Overseas.The Budgetary Committee inserted separate columns for these particulars and labelled them &apos;&apos; optional &apos;&apos; because they had no definite guidance from the Preparatory Commission as to whether these particulars were required or not.The Sub-Committee understands that difficulties would arise if an attempt were made to separate all these particulars, and recommend1 that one column only should be given for each of the Navy and Air Force, and that for the Army separate columns should be given for formations organised on a military basis stationed overseas, and for the total. (There are no formations organised on a military basis stationed at home.)
APPENDIX (B).[E. (30)-27.]Imperial Conference, 1930.Naval Armaments :  Budgetary Limitation.THE accompanying memorandum is circulated to the Imperial Conference 1930 as a basis for discussion.I am instructed to point out that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is not committed to the recommendations contained in this memorandum.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY,Secretary to the Conference.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, October 9.1930.Memorandum.The Present Position regarding Budgetary Limitation at Geneva.1. PUBLICITY in regard to Budgetary Expenditure forms an integral part of the Draft Disarmament Convention, and the texts of the articles dealing with these subjects as they emerged from the first reading of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference at Geneva in 1927 read as follows : &quot; Preamble to Articles D A (I H) and D B (1 K).Whereas it is in the general interest that the expenditure on armaments should be limited, andWhereas the High Contracting Parties are not agreed at present on any satisfactory method of accomplishing this object, andWhereas the High Contracting Parties consider that as a preliminary to such limitation of expenses full publicity should be secured so that on a future occasion it may be possible again to approach this question with better hope of success.Article D A (I H).Observations and Reservations.Each of the High Contracting Parties will communicate to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in a model form, a statement of the amount proposed to be expended on its land, naval and air armaments in the current financial year.This communication shall be made not later than .... months after the entry into force of the legal provisions authorising the expenditure.In putting forward this article, the Preparatory Commission take note of the fact that the work of the Committee of Experts on Budgetary Questions is not complete, and that they hope to produce a relatively simple schedule. The Preparatory Commission are of opinion that the model statement should be as simple as possible con-sistently with the achievement of its object.The British Delegation makes a reservation with regard to the second paragraph of this article.Article D B (I K).Each of the High Contracting Parties will communicate to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in a model form, a statement showing the[8199] e 2
amount actually expended on its land, naval and air armaments during the preceding financial year.This communication will be made not later than .... months after the close of the financial year.&quot;2. The Draft Disarmament Convention is due to be discussed when the Preparatory Commission meets at Geneva on the 3rd November, and with a view to the drafting of instructions for the United Kingdom delegates, a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, on which several of the Dominions were represented, has prepared a Report (Paper No. E (30) 26) dealing with the Convention as a whole. In this Report (page 11, paragraph 35) the Sub-Committee recommend that the following Articles for the Limitation of (a) Total Budgetary Expenditure and (&amp;) Expenditure on Material should be inserted : .&quot; Chapter III. Budgetary Expenditure.Article 12 (D A).Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees that its total annual expenditure on land, sea and air forces, in any budgetary year, shall not exceed the figures given for them in TablesArticle 13 (D B).Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees that its total annual expenditure, in any budgetary year, on the upkeep, purchase and manufacture of war material* shall not exceed the figures indicated in Tables .&apos;1(Paper No. E (30) 26, pages 28 and 29.)3. The Sub-Committee on Reduction and Limitation of Armaments also propose the following article in substitution of Articles D A (I H) and D B (I K) above : &quot; Article 18.Each of the High Contracting Parties shall communicate to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in a model form, a statement showing the actual total amount expended on land, sea, and air forces during the preceding financial year.It shall at the same time communicate to the Secretary-General a statement showing the amount actually expended during the preceding financial year on the upkeep, purchase, and manufacture of war material as defined in Article 13 of the present Convention.These communications shall be made not later than .... months after the close of the financial year.&quot;4. As Article 18 deals solely with past expenditure, the method by which the returns are rendered to the League by the various members of the British Commonwealth would seem to be immaterial.5. It will be noted, however (page 34 of Paper No. E (30) 26), that the special Sub-Committee set up to examine the question of Budgetary Limitation made no recommendation as to whether, in the case of naval forces, Budgetary Limitation should be in the form of a global figure applicable to the naval forces of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations taken together, or of separate figures in respect of the separate budgets of each individual member of the Commonwealth, but merely stated that this Avas a question for consideration.Possible Methods of dealing with Naval Budgetary Limitation so far as theBritish Empire is concerned.6. For the purpose of reckoning the number and tonnage of ships of Avar alknved under the London Naval Treaty, the fleets of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are to be taken together.   The allocation of* War material to be defined iu a special Annex.
numbers and tonnage between the several members of the Commonwealth is a domestic matter to be arranged between the members themselves so long as the agreed total is not exceeded. It is clearly necessary to take this provision into account in making proposals for the limitation of naval budgets. At the same time, it must be realised that under the arrangement now proposed a forecast will have to be made of the highest expenditure in any budgetary year during the period of the convention, although only a proportion of the various naval budgets is affected by the construction of ships allowed under the London Naval Treaty, and that the estimates to be submitted will include various items, such as cost of personnel, cost of fuel, cost of naval harbours, cost of exempt ships and auxiliaries, transport, &amp;c, which have not hitherto been matters for consultation between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.7. On the assumption that the revised Articles 12 (D A) and 13 (D B) will replace those at present figuring in the Draff Disarmament Convention, there would appear to be three ways in which the question of naval Budgetary Limitation for the British Commonwealth of Nations might be dealt with under these Articles :  (A) To limit the naval budget of each Government separately, allowingsufficient margin for a possible increase in the naval forces of that Government within the collective limit prescribed by the London Naval Treaty for all members of the Commonwealth.Since, however, there is in theory no limit to the possibility oi such expansion, short of 100 per cent, of the Treaty strength of the fleets of all the members of the Commonwealth, any such arrangement would lead to a dilemma; either the margin for possible expansion of each budget separately must be inflated beyond all reason, or the freedom of the several members to exjiand their fleets within the prescribed limit of total strength must be correspondingly circumscribed.(B) The second method would be that the Governments of the commonwealth should submit to separate Budgetary Limitation, the possibility of expansion, so far as new construction is concerned being provided for, not by adding an unlimited margin to each budget, but by claiming the right of &quot; virement &quot; between the budgets of the several members, according as it may be agreed hereafter to apportion the share o* each in the collective tonnage. Such &quot; virement &quot; would, of course, be subject to the proviso that the sum total of the several budgets as separately prescribed in the Disarmament Convention shall not thereby be exceeded.An objection to this arrangement is that it might be viewed with suspicion by foreign Powers as giving the members of the Commonwealth an elasticity which is denied to them. It might also be argued, and probably not without reason, that the &quot;virement &quot; provision would lead to unnecessary inflation of the margins of the individual budgets, and other Powers would doubtless resolve to counteract this advantage by inflating their own margins beyond what they would otherwise have deemed necessary.(C) The third method  is that,  for the purpose of the disarmament convention, the amounts of the naval budgets of the several Governments of the Commonwealth should be combined to form a single whole, which should be inserted in the Convention as the total amount of the &quot; Naval Budgets of all Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; Within this total the allocation between the several members of the amounts of their respective naval budgets would be a purely domestic matter for discussion and agreement between themselves.8. In favour of this last proposal, it may be mentioned that it conforms precisely with the principle that has already been accepted in the London Naval Treaty in relation to the number and tonnage of ships, and appears to be free from the objections to the first two alternatives.9. While it would be necessary to add some margin for contingencies, the margin would be available as a central pool for the needs of all members of the
sbCommonwealth, and would therefore be much smaller than that which would be required under alternative (A) above. It also gives the advantages of &quot; virement &quot; without the disadvantages attached to the public assumption of that privilege, as under alternative (B).10. On the other hand, it is scarcely true that this obligation is inherent in the acceptance of the principle of a single quota of ships and tonnage in the Washington and London Treaties. The method of giving effect to the London Treaty may be settled, as far as building programmes over the period of the Treaty are concerned, as a result of discussion at the Imperial Conference. The adjust-ment of naval budgets, on the other hand, would mean annual consultation and discussion.11. Another practical objection to the single budgetary system is the difficulty often experienced in getting the United Kingdom naval estimates settled in time for their presentation to Parliament by a fixed date. If to the normal Treasur3&apos; and Cabinet discussions are to be added telegraphic communi-cations with all the Dominions, the administrative inconvenience would be immense and the system might prove unworkable. Again, if a single budgetary limitation is accepted, there would also presumably (if the original Article D A (I H) mentioned in paragraph 1 were adopted) have to be a single presentation to the League of Nations of the prospective expenditure of the United Kingdom and the various Dominions and India, compiled, incidentally, from estimates which do not cover the same period and only become available at widely different dates. It should here be mentioned that considerable difficulty will arise in any case, owing to the financial years not coinciding in every case. This difficulty will arise, however, whatever system is adopted.12. From the above paragraphs it will be clear that there are certain difficulties, so far as the British Commonwealth is concerned, inherent in any system of naval Budgetary Limitation, and, generally speaking, methods which would be most convenient and practicable from the Commonwealth point of vieAv seem those least likely to be acceptable to the League.13. In the circumstances it is suggested that any solution put forward by the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be based on the following considerations : (1) The total margin allowed for contingencies should be kept as low as. possible, to avoid creating a precedent for other members of the League.(2) The procedure adopted should be in accordance with the status of the several members of the Commonwealth as separate members of the League.(3) The procedure adopted should  not be such as to prevent completeflexibility of arrangements as regards the relative share of the severalGovernments in the naval defence of the Empire. (4) Such adjustments of naval budgets within the Empire should be regardedas a purely domestic matter and not as a matter for the League ofNations to discuss.Suggested Sohition.14. Bearing these desiderata in mind, a solution might, it is thought, be-sought in the following manner. In the tables of Budgetary Expenditure to be annexed to the Convention under the revised articles 12 (D A) and 13 (D B) the figures for naval expenditure of each member of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be given separately, but they would be grouped together in a single block. At the end of the group, the aggregate figures for the British Commonwealth of Nations should be shown, perhaps, in italics. A footnote to this total would then be added, stating that &quot; virement &quot; is allowed by arrange-ment between the different parts of the Empire within this declared total.The best method of ensuring that the Tables in the Disarmament Convention are arranged in this manner would appear to be for each individual member of the British Commonwealth of Nations to submit to the General Disarmament Conference its own figures, and to show at the same time the figures for the total naval expenditure of all members of the Commonwealth, or, if it were thought
preferable, the individual figures for the other members, together with a footnote as suggested. How this could most conveniently be done is a matter which would best be left for settlement between the representatives of the various parts of the Empire at the Conference.15. It is fully realised by all members of the League of Nations that the British Commonwealth in constitution and composition is a thing apart, and there seems to be no reason to believe that any exception would be taken to &apos;&apos; virement &apos;&apos; of the nature suggested above in the particular circumstances. On the other hand the greatest possible frankness in submitting any estimate to the League, either separately or together, is obviously of the first importance, particularly in view of the possible attitude of the United States.It is for consideration whether it would not be desirable, in the event of this plan proving acceptable to the Imperial Conference, to ascertain private^ the views of the principal foreign Naval Powers before proposing it at Geneva.16. The considerations dealt with in this Memorandum will, of course, only arise if the Imperial Conference is in agreement on the principle of Budgetary Limitation;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, October 9, 1930.
