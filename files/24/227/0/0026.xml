1tj, E G R 5 TcCOPY NO:;,Po so (5B)oG A 3 IKESUPPLY AKD TRANSPORT OSGAKISATI OK.1 eI circulate,  for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum (see Appendix) by Sir John Anderson on the steps which are now required to bring into a state of full preparedness the Organisation which is maintained for the purpose of carrying on essential services in the event of an emergency of the hind contemplated &quot;by the Emergency Power s Ac s i 920 a2o      The present position is, &quot;briefly, that the Organisation which was created for this purpose,  and which existed in 1926, is in many respects incomplete,,      It -was decided &quot;by the last Government (Cabinet 55(51), Conclusion 17)  that the Government Departments concerned should, under the general co-ordination of  the Supply and Transport Committee of the Cabinet, bring up to date the arrangements with which the Committee deals, hut that no action should he taken involving publicity,,3o      The Departments have carried the work of revision as far as is possible under the limitations imposed by this decision, hut it will he seen from Sir John Anderson&apos;s memorandum that there are certain important steps involving? in greater or less degree, some risk, or even prohahilit;, , of publicity which are indispensah 1eo4,      This matter was considered by the Supply and Transport Committee at a meeting on the 15th January, and the Committee reached the unanimous conclusion that the steps referred to in the memorandum must he taken if the whole Organisation is
&amp;   The Ministers present were:- The Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Tar,  the Seex&apos;etary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Health,  the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Transport,  the Secretary for Mines, and the Civil Lord of the Admiralty0not to lose its value for the purpose for which   it was designed, namely, as an instrument capable of being put to immediate use in the event of an emergency,50     The opinion of the Ministers present35 was that theCabinet should he asked forthwith to authorise the taking of all steps necessary to complete the Supply and transport organisation^ and that it would he impossible to&quot; find amore appropriate time that&apos;the present for taking this action.     The industrial, situation at the moment is clear,and the Minister of Labour advised the Committee that,so far as his Department can foresee, there is nothing in sight which Is likely to cause serious trouble,,      Stepstherefore which might, if industrial trouble were In prospect,be regarded as provocative,  can now be taken with little or no danger of attracting unfavourable criticism,5,     Next summer it will presumably be- necessary to under-take fresh legislation for dealing with the hours of workin coal mines, and the stage of discussion and negotiationwill shortly begin.      If steps are not taken immediately to complete the emergency organisation,  it might be difficultto take action later in the year without risk of prejudicingthese negotiations^     The Secretary for Mines is strongly of opinion that all necessary action should be completed before the end of February at the latest,,70     The Cabinet is therefore asked to approve, in general, the removal of the ban on action involving risk of publicity and? in particular, the steps referred to in paragraphs 6 to %4, of the attached memorandum^So      In connection with the appointment of Civil Commissioners,
Q (TV 9(J u(paragraph. 6 of the memorandum) ,  it should he mentioned that the last Government decided (Cabinet 65(31), Conclusion 5)  that no nomination should he made to the post of Chief Civil Commissioner, hut that the organisation should he under the control of the Supply and Transport Committee itselfs of which the Home Secretary is Chairmanj Sir John Anderson acting mider his direction and authority as Executive Officer,,        In view of Sir John Anderson&apos;s approaching departure, it will he necessary  to reconsider this arrangement.9a      If the Cabinet approve the foregoing recommendations it is to he expected that information as to the action of the Government may reach the Press, no doubt in a distorted form3 and that this would lead to comment, perhaps of a sensational hind.      The Supply and Transport Committee were of the opinion that this risk should he anticipated &quot;cy the issue of a brief official statement, and. they recommend the Cabinet to authorise   me, in consultation with the Minister of Labour, to take such steps as may he necessary to inform the public cf the action talceni(Intld)        HeS.ae Office, L6th January5 1932,
SECRET.A P ? D 5 D I X.S.T.(51)2.0 A B I NET.supply and/MTSPQRT COMMITTEE.Memorandum &quot;by the Permanent Under Secretary ofState. Home Office.It will he remembered that on 7th September last a meeting of Ministers -was held to consider what steps would be required to bring into a state of full preparedness the organisation which is maintained for the purpose  jf carrying on eacential services in the event of an emergency cf the kind contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1920. 3.      The matter was then considered by the Cabinet and as a result the &quot;Supply and Transport Committee, which had existed under previous Governments, was reconstituted and Departments were instructed to bring their arrangements up to date but that no action should be taken involving publicity. 3.     The Committee was  asked alsy? to consider the appointment of a Chief Civil Commissioner but it was subsequently arranged that, for the time being, the duties appropriate to this post should be undertaken by the Home Secretary. 4.     The situation has changed since September and the political considerations which operated against publicity have now receded into the background.    It in submitted that, if the organisation Is to be brought inte a state of full preparedness (and so long au the Emergency Powers Act remains cn the Statute Book this appears to be essential) it would not be possible to find a more favourable time than the present to fill in the gaps, especially as there is no industrial emergency in prospect and therefore no cause to fear an accusation of being provocative.5.      The position has been reviewed by a Conference of Departmental representatives and it is clear that the following
9 A ,-1steps, all of which involve in greater or less degree some risk of publicity, must be taken if the organisation is to he converted into an effective piece of machinery,,(1) Civil Commissioners; 6. It is denirahle that the persons who would in anemergency act an Civil Commissioners in the nine Divisions and two special areas (Louden and the London Docks) should he appointed in advance so that they may familiarise themselves with their duties and establish contact with the official machine.(2) Volunteer Service Committees; 7. The arrangements for the enrolment of voluntary labour(one of the most important elements in the scheme of Government assistance) depend c:i the existence of Volunteer Service Committees in seme ISO areas.    T^ith a few exceptions,  the Committees consist of Government officials except their Chairmen who are not members of the Government Sendee.    It is not known how man;/ of the former Chairmen are still available hut it is certain that at least 25 per cent,  of their number will require to he  replaced,    A great deal of detailed work remains to he done after the Chairman have been appointed and it is important to proceed with their appointment as scon as possible.    The longer this is delayed the greater the risk of circumstances arising which will make it difficult to appoint them without an appearance of being provocative.(3) District Coal Emergency Committees; 8o Representatives of the coalowners are required to serve on these Committees,  of which there are thirteen..    The Committees are an essential part of the Mines Department machinery for the conservation of coal supplied and the Committees would he ineffective without representatives of the cealowners.    Aa in the case of the Chairmen of Volunteer Service Committees, there is less risk of charges of provocativenose fef the appointments are made now (even if they become generally xenown) than if they are postponed until an
emergency is imminent.( 4) Port Emergency Officers: 9* It is contemplated that schemes for the emergency workingof the principal docks outside London (fur which separate piana nave already teen prepared)  should be worked    out under the guidance of persons who have been appointed by the Government as Port Emergency Officers.    This will necessarily ta^ce some little time and, if the schemes are not completes.,  it would be necessary in an emergency to improvise plans which, a c the experience of 1926 shews, would certainly not be economical and could not be relied upon to be effectxve.    It is therefore important that the Port Emergency Officers should be called together and instructed to proceed with the preparation of schemes.(5) Read Transport Organisation: 10.      (a) Area Road OfficersB      The list of Area Road Officers (of whom there are about 100) requires revision,.    These are members of the staffs of local authorities and will wish to consult either their Authority or at any rate the Chairman of the appropriate Committee before agreeing to serve in the Supply and Transport Organicativ;n.    They are a very important part of the Organisation and it is most desirable that the 13s t should be completed as s-jon as possible.11.      (b) Chairmen of Ii .ulap;e Committees.    Similar considerations apply to the Chairmen of Haulage Committees as to the Area R&amp;ad Officers, but as the Chairmen of Haulage Committees are members of the trade and net members of the Government or Municipal service the possibility   if publicity is greater if they are approached.12o      (c) The instructions to the various persons concerned in the Road Transport Organisation have been codified and revised as far as possible but in order tc complete them it is desirable  . tea enter into consultation with a small number of persons

The list of volunteers for the operation of the electric power stations in London is seriously out of date and would take a considerable time to revise.      Its revision would he done by approaching the institute of Electrical Engineers and asking them to circularise their Members, Associate Members and students resident in the London area with a view to ascertaining whether they would he prepared to act during a national emergency. (7) London Milk Pool: &apos; 14.        It is important that some progress should he made in overhauling the arrangements for the supply of milk to London in the event of railway transport not being available.      For this purpose it would he necessary for the Board of Trade to get into consultation with three or four persons in the milk trade.(Intld.)    J.A.
