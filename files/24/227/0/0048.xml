*j &amp;Effect on Cost of Living of Balance of Trade Report. Note &quot;by the Minister of Labour.:At thoir meeting on 21st January I gave verbally to the Cabinet certain estimates as to the effect on the cost of living of the proposals of the Balance of Trade Committee. In accordance with Cabinet Conclusion 5(32),  2,  I circulate herewith to the Cabinet a memorandum which has been prepared jointly by the Treasury and my Department,  showing the separate and collective effects on the cost of living of the following Reports before the Cabinets-,48  (32)Gcpy No.CABINET.(l)    Report on Balance of Trade(cp.  -25(32)) notoverlooking the 10 per cent,  increase in tho costof imports assumed at the end of paragraph 13 oftho Report.(2)    Report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on Wheat Quota (CP. -22(32)).

1.      If an all round tariff of 10 per cent, without any exemptions were to raise by 10 per cent,  the retail price of each commodity  (excluding rent,  coal, pas and fares) included in the cost of living index,  that index would be increased by nearly 11 points.      The exclusion of moat and bacon reduces the figure to nearly 9 points;    i.e.,  the increase in tho cost of living index would be at most from 147 to 156.      These figures are given at once as they can bo reached by simple arithmetic. They represent the extreme hypothesis,  putting the matter at its worst, because it is unlikely that retail prices would rise in direct proportion and,  further, because account must be taken of the influence cf the tariff on tho value of sterling. 2.      Reference is made j.n the Cabinet minutes to an estimate given in the Balance of Trad.c report that the cost of imports will rise in 1932 to 10 per cent,  over  tho corresponding cost in September last.      This does not in any sense imply a uniform rise,  and the figures might vary widely for different commodities. The estimate of an average 10 per cent,  rise was concerned mainly with the rise in prices due to the depreciation cf the  .      Since we left gold the average wholesale price cf all commodities has, in fact,  risen 7.8 per cent.,  and of food commodities by 7-3 per cent.,  though the figures vary greatly for different commodities. The rise in price of imported commodities is probably a trifle higher.      The estimate in the Balance of Trade report corresponds closely,  therefore,  to present facts.
3. If wholesale prices were to rise further in connectionwith the depreciation of the  ,  a further increase in the cost of living would take place without any tariff.        It is impossible to  say whether such a further rise in wholesale prices will take place or to estimate its amount, which would depend among other factors on the extent to which imports come from countries on a gold basis and on a non-gold basis, respectively. The rise of nearly 8 per cent which hasalready taken place in wholesale prices has been accompanied by a rise of about 2 per cent,  in retail food prices and of only 2 points in the cost of living figure.       But here again it is impossible to  say whether the depreciation of the   has yet produced its full effect on retail prices. 4. There are two points to be considered in connectionwith the interaction of the tariff and the depreciation of the  : (i) Since ad valorem duties are levied on the actual price of imports,  an increase in the price of imports due to the depreciation of the   would slightly increase the effect of the tariff.    The higher the price of imported goods on which the ad valorem duties ai*e levied the greater the effect of the tariff.        This, however,  is a point of only slight practical importance. If the estimated rise in theprice of imports mentioned in the Balance of Trade report were doubled the effect of an ad valorem tariff on the cost of living would be increased, but not sufficiently to make a difference of more than 1 point in the cost cf living figure.      As it is understood that many of the food duties may be specific duties,  and bearing in mind that the
cost for instance of the wheat quota to consumers diminishes with higher prices,  this particular consideration can be neglected without risk of any measurable error, (ii)l more important matter is the influence of the tariff on the walue of sterling.      It is impossible to be certain of the order of magnitude of this influence, hut in the Immediate future it may he very important, while in some degree the effect may be enduringo      The nature of this influence is threefold:-(a) to improve the balance of trade by checking imports;(h) it may attract foreign capital for investment in new factories in the. United Kingdom;(c) it may check withdrawals of short term balances by strengthening confidence in the future of sterling.Against any increase in the cost of living due to a tariffmust he set,therefore,  its effect in diminishing the costof living by raising the value of steriingcPood Items other than ^Taeat.5c        The effect on the cost of living index figure of the adoption of a general tariff on imports cannot be calculated exactlyo    It is uncertain to what extent the retail prices of imported commodities would he affected by any specified ad valorem rate of import duty,or how far the retail prices of commodities produced at home would rise in sympathy with those of the imported supplies.    It is probable that the effects of the duties v/ould vary considerably with different articles, (&apos;,      At the present time, when quantities of food stuffs are being pressed for sale all over the world at prices which bear little relation to costs of production,  the effect of a tariff on prices may he quite trifling.        The figures which
  fc3 lA?follow, however, all relate to normal conditions and may therefore all he toe high estimates of the immediate future. 7,      If a general tariff of 10 per cent,  on imports of agricultural produce were to increase the retail prices of both imported and home food produce by 10 per cent., the effect would be to raise the Ministry of Labour cost of living index figure by nearly 8 points-    Meat and bacon (2 pointr.) being excluded,  the figure is reduced to nearly G points:    if wheat and flour are also excluded (to be dealt with below),  the maximum figure is reduced to 4-g-polnts8.      A general tariff of 10 per cent., however, would probably not raise retail prices by an equivalent percentage. Liquid iailkj potatoes and fresh fish, of which the home production is approximately 100 per cent.,  94 per cent., and 80 per cent., respectively, might be little affected, and these items account for if points in the above total. Home production is also important in the case of eggs, margarine, butter,  etc.    Moreover,  a substantial part of the retail price of imported food represents handling and overhead costs in this country; which might not in all cases be increased by 10 per cento    When allowance is made for the operation of these factors, the increases in the cost of living index figure would,  it is thought, range within the following limits :--Increase&quot;(Point sT*A general tariff of 10 per cent.    on imported food.............. 5 to 6-Ditto- but excluding meat and bacon . 0.0 . ...... ovs. ... p 3 to 4-2-Ditto- but excluding, wheat,meat and bacon ...........o 2 to 5.....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
III&apos;.      Wheat Quota,,9.      It is impossible to estimate the effect of the Wheat quota until the basic price and the size of the quota are determined.    It is understood from the Ministry of Agriculture that it would be reasonable to assume an increase per sack of flour of about 2sa  or 2s06do    The effect of the quota on the consumer would be almost the same as that   .of a 10 per cento  tariff.    The rise in the cost of living figure would be from 1 to 1-g- points0fv*      Non-Pood Items010.      A general tariff of 10 per cent,  on dmports other than food would affect certain other items covered bj? the cost of living Index, vis,, clothing,  and such articles as lamp-oil, soap 3 candles, domestic ironmongery-; brushes, and pottery. Of these clothing is by far the most important,.    The effect of the duty on retail prices, particularly in the clothing group,  cannot he computed exactly, but it appears unlikely that the retail prices of most of these articles would be raised by as much as 10 per cent., especially if raw cotton and wool were excluded frcm the operation of the tariff. It is highly improbable that, with such exclusions, the increases in retail prices in these groups,  directly resulting from the tariff, could raise the cost of living figure by more than 2 points,  and the actual increase might not he more than 1 points    No seriotis error would be involved in an assumption that the probable increase would be between 1 and 2 points.x   The principal items not directly affected would be rents, coal, gas, and fares0
V. Summary.11. The maximum,  &quot;outside&quot;, effect of a 10 per cent,  tariff (excluding meat and bacon; on the cost of living index, on the assumption that retail prices generally were raised by 10 per cent, would be an increase of not more than 9 points, from 147 to 156 points,.12,  The probable, as distinct from the outside maximum effect, of the actual proposals before the Cabinet is estimated as follows  :-.Increase.Food Items (other than meat,, bacon and wheat) ... 2 to 3 points Wheat Ouota 1 to 1-g- pointsNon-Food Items . i ..... .1............. , . ..... . . . , , , 1 to 2 pointsTOTAL 4 to 6g- pointsAs regards the near future,  these figures may prove too high owing to the surplus supplies of foodstuffs in the world,13, An increase of 8 per cent,  in wholesale prices due to the depreciation of the   has up to the present been accompanied by an increase of 2 points in the cost of living figure.        It is impossible to be certain that the depreciation of the   has yet produced its full effect on prices.        A further increase in wholesale prices due to currency depreciation would raise the cost of living further, without any tariff,       Against any specific effect of a tariff in raising the cost of living must he set its influence in raising the value of sterling and offsetting the effect of depreciation.
14,  In this memorandum account has not &quot;been taken of the possibility that immediately upon the introduction of a tariff, and for a time thereafter,  there might arise something of an organised attempt on the part of retailers to &quot;profiteer&quot; i,e.  to exact from consumers an additional price in no way justified by their increased costs.        The.main safeguard against this possibility is competition which the Board of Trade have found to be a moot effective deterrent in recent months.        Moreover,  during that period the Board have been in constant touch with wholesalers and retailers of the staple foodstuffs with a view to preventing unreasonable increases of price and this work will be continued for the time being.
