SBCKEST.G.T. 1802. WAR, CA3IKBT.* THE   AMERICA!!   ATTITUDE   TO   THE   WAR.Memo, by the Director of Information.Although four months have elapsed since the United States came in there are still signs that the American people is not yet fully awake to the gravity of the situation.   In the Eastern cities, where the people naturally possess a greater knowledge of theresponsibilities undertaken by their country in entering the War, the position is regarded with a confidence which may be as dangerous as indifference.   In the States more distant from the capital cities of Washington and New York ignorance of the causes of the War, and the reasons actuating their Government in joining forces with the Allies is more general and is naturally accompanied by lack of interest which may conceivably develop into/antagonism to the sacrifices demanded.This attitude is by no means confined to the general public but it is in evidence in many sections of political, religious and journalistic life which lead the thought and inspire the action of the nation.   Amongst the evidences of this is the difficulty experienced in securing, without endless delay, the assent of Congress to the various motions brought forward giving to the Executive the powers necessary for the proper prosecution of the War.Our Publicity Department in conjunction with the corresponding Department set up in America is doing everything possible to energise journalistic circles in the United States and to provide them with the material necessary.   Eut journalism even in full work - and it is very far from being in full war-work yet in the United States - la only one of the agencies controlling public opinion, and it is important to see what steps can be taken to bring other opinion-controlling sections into closer touch with the ideals for which England and France are fighting and with the gigantic efforts which the Allied nations on this side of the Atlantic are making, thus giving them a clearer uiew of the duties and responsibilities to which the United States has committed itself if it is to do its part in the War.The first to be attas ked on these lines is Congress itself, whose members are not only able, through their platforms and polit-ical organisations spread throughout the country, to influence and arousj public opinion, but have through their actions and speeches in Congress the power to assist or hamper, to hasten or delay the work of the President and of every Government Department,*3?or these reasons it is suggested that immediate 3teps should be taken to invite Congress to send as many representatives as may-be willing to come, to visit this country, Prance and Belgium, so as to be brought personally into touch with the   work in progress behind the lines, on the fighting front, in holding up the Navies of our enemies and in maintaining the sea routes. These representatives would at the same time obtain a more ^intimate knowledge of and a closer sympathy with the methods and v aims of their Allies and would have an opportunity to compare them with the brutalities of Germany the effects of which would be driven home with a force impossible except by a personal visit to Belgium and ilorthem^rance.   It would be astonishing if the- majority if not all who came over did not return to the united States imbued with a war Spirit that would influence Congress and the American people to more determination and energy.
(Sgd)   John BuchanDept. of Information, Foreign Office.August 8-ch, 1917,.As there-1^ in the United States a Party whixiii always looks -with suspicion if not with antagonism on any British move, it is f[  important that.if an invitation he sent. Prance and possibly Italy should join in it.-  It is therefore suggested;-1.     That Mr. Page, the American Ambassador should be o^sulted as to the wisdom of issuing a joint invitation from Groat Britain, Prance and Italy on the lines suggested above.2,      That in the event of Mr.-Page concurring, theFrench and Italian GoverrjtPejnts he immediately asked to join us in sending an   invitation to the members of Congress to come over as the guests of. the Allied &quot;Gcveminents to visit this country and the French,, Belgian and Italian Fronts.
