(This Document is the Property ofgj3 CP. g To        His Britannic IViajesty&apos;s Government) S.T.-189EW A H     CABIN Eg.,STATE   OS1   IRELAND,   &apos; Memorandum by...the Chief Secretary for Irel^ndoThe lull in.the; activities of the Sinn Fein party which I mentioned last week has continued and is sufficiently definite to be regarded as giving corrcboration to reports which have reached me from various quarters that the Sinn Fein leaders are now resolved not to do anything which would be likely to bring about a new insurrectionary rising under present con-ditions.    This belief is very commonly held, and I am inclined to think it is well founded,   At the same time the more violent of the adherents of these leaders continue to preach rebellion and do all they can to make it possible *   A good many of tho extremists of whose incendiary speeches information has been given by the police to the Military Authorities have been arrested;   some for incitements to rebellion;   some for taking part in the attempted re-organisation of the rebel Volunteer Force, and others for other offences against Defence of the Realm. Regal&amp;tiona, and some of the arrested men have been tried and sentenced to .terms of imprisonment.   These include several of the most dangerous rebels who were released in the general amnesty before the opening of the Convention,On the whole.good results appear to me to have followed the enforcement of the new Defence of the Realm Regulations adopted to meet Irish conditions.   In the counties of Sorry and C&amp;lway, however, disturbed conditions prevail,,   There have been two or three instances,&apos; in remote districts, of ^id-night raids by disguised men searching for arms.   The police also report a sullen and defiant :, attitude on the part of the peasantry in some distrlctSc   But the state of these counties shews a.tendency to improve.   Apart from operations likely to
lead to Insurrectionary-trouble the -Siim^ein-leaders are organising asystematic effort to secure all the representa-tive positions in the country, urban and rural, political and municipal a   I hear that they already have at their disposal a l*rge fund for electioneering purposes and that it is steadily growing.   It may bo assumed therefore that they will- suajeed to a gre^t extent in ousting the old nationalist members from local as well as from Parliamentary positions, and will seek in all directions to render Government under the -authority of the Imperial Par3iamont difficult if not impossible.   I think it will bo practicable at the right time to defeat these efforts without necessarily resorting to very extreme methods.The Convention seems at length to be accepted generally as a serious factor in the political life of tho country0 Among its members and its critics the expectation that good will eome of its labours is certainly on the increasea   The -arrangements made by the Chairman raid Sir Francis Eopwood for the circulation to the members of information concerning the elemental facts relating to the Government of Ireland and tho relations between Ireland and Great Britain have put a great many influential men in possession of valuable information which will affect their conduct and is likely to be widely spread in the country.   The debates and private discussions which have now proceeded for several days upon the general topic of Irish needs snd demands are also said among well informed people to bo producing excellent practical results in the Convention itsolf and to some extent outside it,   Host week whon the Convention is to sit at Belfast, the wholesome process of clearing up misconcep-tions between North and South will be further he3.ped by the hospitable reception offered to the members by the lord Mayor
30th August, 1917.and other leading citizens.   Influential members of the Convention appear generally to entertain a hope that the tolerant spirit shewn during the preliminary debates to a good deal of plain speech will prove strong enough to carry the   assembly with good temper and a continued desire for agreement, through the coming difficult time when it will have to- deal with definite proposals.There is I am sorry to say grave reason to fear that the bumper corn harvest which was in view a fortnight since v/ill be to a very serious extent destroyed &amp;nd domagec by the continuous storms which have since occurred.   The agricultural situation is alarming, but not-hopeless.(Initialled)   H.E.D.
