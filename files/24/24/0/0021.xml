INTRODUCTION OP THE 9d. LOAF.WHOLESALE PRICE OFFLOURTO BAKERS.In connection with the introduction of the 9d. loaf, it is necessary to settle the wholesale price at which the State will sell flour through the Mills to bakers and other retailers.   The question immediately arises whether cheap flour is to be provided for all purposes, including the making of cake etc, or only for the manufacture of bread.   This question does not arise in a practical form in respect of cakes made at home for it is clearly impracticable to prevent the householder from using flour at home as he thinks fit.In respect of flour supplied to bakers and other traders two alternative courses are open:-(1)   to issue cheap flour for all save a few clearlydefined purposes, susceptible of easy control, such a3 the manufacture of biscuits and sizing materials;(2)   to sell flour to bakers and other traders at two different pricesIf the first course is adopted a subsidy of about  1,500,000 a year will be granted to bakers in respect of cakes and confectionery, and exception might be taken to this in Parliament and possibly by the Allies.   Moreover, it is found impracticable to fix maximum prices for cake, so that if the baker gets cheap flour for cake making, the benefit of the subsidy may not reach the consumer.   The two price system is not regarded by the bakers themselves as unworkable though they would dislike it.(a)At (say) 43/9d. a sack (of 280 lbs,) tobe used solely for bread making or for retailsale as flour for domestic consumption.(b)At (say) 63/- if required for any other purpose such as making cake or confectionery./On
On the other hand, there are grave practical objections to the two price system: -(1)        it is difficult to prevent the dishonest baker using cheap flour for cakes.   Hence elaborate Government conti*ol and interference will be necessary, involving a change of working practice on the part of the trade and causing annoyance. It is the great number of small men in the trade, who would find it difficult to work under the system.(2)       There may be some confusion at the start through the local Food Control Committee not being ready to grapple with the heavy tasks the system would place on them (Registration of Retailers etc,,) Postponement of the introduction of the ninepenny loaf to give the local Committees more time to get ready cannot be contemplated, as stocks in bakers hands are already running low.(5)        Assuming as seems probable, that the baiters demand and obtain lower wholesale prices for bread flour as a set-off to the high price for cake flour, the two price system may ultimately cost the Government more than it saves since the lower price would also apply to flour for domestic consumption.On balance I favour the first alternative, that is tosay a single price for all flour, and with the consent of theWar Cabinet I propose to adopt this course and to introducethe nine-penny loaf not later than September 17th.RHONDDA.23rd August 1917.
