SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.WEEKLY REPORT OH RUMANIA(29 August, 1917).XIV.DRW/014.The General Situation.The splendid resistance offered &quot;by the Rumanian armies on theheld up the German advance into Moldavia;    consequently the removal of the Rumanian Government to Russia is for the present postponed. Provisional arrangements for evacuation, however, are being made, the only point in doubt being as to whether the seat of Governmentprefer, to Poltava.     Negotiations on the point are proceeding. The lnterna.1 Situation.As the Rumanian Parliament has been adjourned till next November there is little opportunity for the development of internal political discussions.   Since the solution of the Cabinet crisis the country has settled down again to an enforced party truce, and: the party press almost confines itself to a reproduction in full of the speeches delivered by the various party leaders in the debates on the reforms last June.     Some feeling was aroused by the unfortunate allusion of Mr Bratianu to the Conservative Party as having &quot;ceased to exist&quot; because the official leader, Mr Marghiloman, had remained behind in Bucarest.       The Conservative press took up the challenge and, while denouncing Marghiloman and all his Yvorks, insisted strongly that the Conservative Party was still in being and, when the international situation permitted, would resume its freedom of action.&apos;    The natural and persistentSeret, especially in the region of Maraseqti, has for the time beingshould be transferred to Kherson or, as the Rumanians appear to
attacks on Marghiloman and the other pro^Germans called forth a reply in the press from one of Marghiloman&apos;s supporters, the ex-Deputy Lascar Antoniu, but, apart from this, Marghiloman appears to be finally discredited.Conditions in uallachia.In addition to Marghiloman himself, various other Germanophil politicians remained behind in Bucarest.     rCr Garp has recently given an interview to the Stockholm pro-German paper Aftonbladet, in which he reiterates his old views ag&apos;to the necessity of a Rumanian alliance with the Central Powers.-     The interview is naturally reproduced con amore by the German press.-  The German military authorities have set up a Provisional Rumanian Administration in Bucarest vlth four Ministers of Departments:   the well-known Germanophils D. Nenitescu, Grigore Antipa, Lupu Costahe and Virgil Arion.     The Rumanian press promises to deal summarily with these traitors after the war.The Germans have set up a &quot;Rumanian Economic Association&quot;, the aims of which are allegedly to help the Rumanian population with machinery and other aids to economic production and to increase the productive power of the occupied province to the greatest possible extent.     The German press claims that 90 to 95 per cent, of the arable soil of Rumania is now being cultivated and announces that an excellent harvest is to be expected.   The maize harvest, which in May, owing to the drought, was feared for, now offers good prospects In consequence of the abundant rains, especially in the Danube districts.     Vines, peas and beans are also expected to give good results;   the fruit harvest is less promising. This Is, of course, the unsupported assertion of the German frees, and there is no means of checking it.
Rumania;s Irredenta.The appointment of Count Apponyi to the post of Minister of Public Instruction in the Eszterhazy Government was, as Count ApponyI&apos;s antecedents vould have led anyone to expect, followed at once by the inauguration of a new policy of repression. The Rumanian Orthodox schools in Sibiu (Hermannstadt), Arad and Karansebes, and the Rumanian Uniate schools in various places have been informed that they are to close.The new campaign against the Rumanian Church, schools and language in Hungary is foreshadowed in the chauvinist articles now daily appearing in the Hungarian press.Rumania&apos;s International Relations.The Rumanian press has at last begun to exhibit a consciousness that the Rumanian Government and people as a Whole has done little to expound Its ideals and aims to the civilised world.   Closer touch with the Western European Powers and America is demanded. The message sent by His ::ajesty the King to the King of Rumania on August 22, followed up as it was by Mr Lloyd George&apos;s telegram to MT Bratianu on August 27, and the appeal in the British press of that date issued by the Anglo-Rumanian Society, will be an earnest to the Rumanian people that their wish for closer relations with this country is reciprocated here.29.8.17.
