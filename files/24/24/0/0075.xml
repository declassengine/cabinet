Department of Information SECRET b , Victoria Street.August 28 1917Memorandum on Dr. Wekerle(The following memorandum on the new Hungarian Premier has been received from a very woll-informed source).Alexander Wekerle, the most elusive of Hungarian statesmen, the &quot;old fox&quot; as he is called in Hungary, has only one counterpart in European politics - the Italian Giolitti.     He is unscrupulous and callous, without any prejudice or principle-     Jf called upon he would do tho same hard work to assist democracy to victory as he would exert himself to establish autocracy if expected to do so. Long ago he said to the writer of these linos:    &quot;Politics iB my business.     I have to deliver the goods that-are orderod from me. I am not dealing in principles but I have to keep the country in order.&quot;    The only business he takes seriously is economics.     An export of European reputation, he will wax enthusiastic about his budget and all matters connected with it.     And it is interesting to note that during his repeated tenures of office he always resign-ed for economical reasons.    Yet, it is his very contempt of party &quot;politics that makes Wekerle a strong leader of a hoterogenous coa-lition.     This he proved during his administration from 1906 to 1909 when he succeeded in combining the 1867 parties with the Independence party.    His authority as a financial genius, his imperturbable calm-ness, his great gift in dilatory and compromising diplomacy are hisinvaluable assets.Can Wekerle be expected to master the present situation?The new Prime Minister has undoubtedly great influence with Count TiszaVs labour Party which, under various other names, he had
-    2 -mmled for many years.    Still greater is his influence with Count AndrassyVs&apos; Constitutional Party and the comhination of the two would give him a very respectable majority.     His plan will doubtless be to combine these parties and to secure himself the assistance of the Clerical Peopled Party (not very easily).     In order to succeed he will have to find the juste milieu between tho Eszterhazy project of franchise and that of Count Tisza.     In this case the Karolyi partyand the democratic members of the other parties will form the opposi-tion.     In othor words a -compromise which will considerably dilute the democratic contents of King Charles1 new programme but at the same time lessen the weight of the Independent influence.     from the dynasty1s point of view a more favourable prospect;   from the Euro-pean angle of vision a fact to be deplored, because tho power of theIndependence party of Count Karolyi, though not strong enough tothreaten dynastic interosts or to change the policy of the Monarchy,could, If exerted on the Government side, act as a loavon within andbe used as a strong deterrent against Germany if the presumptions of ethat friend became too unbearable.Wekerlets attitude towards Germany is quite clear.     Ever since its establishment he has been the Hungarian President of tho &quot;Mittel-europ&amp;ischer Wirtschaftsverbund&quot;.     In articles which ho published during the war he always pleaded for a commercial tseaty with Germanyupon tho principle of &quot;long duration&quot; (20 years;   here he will find both Count Apponyi and Karolyi strong opponents).     But he has, in public discussions, declared that scientific and political considor-ations compelled him to disfavour the economical scheme of &quot;Central Europe&quot;.     Politically, he has always been a strong partisan of the Alliance with Germany,, not so much because of his Wurtemberg origin (his father came from there to Hungary) but because of tho Russo-phobia common to most Hungarian politicians of the old school.     He
lias, however, never taken an intense interest in international polities with tho only exception of Serbia during the annexation crisis of 1903-1909 when he was the only Hungarian statesman who repeatedly told me at the time he would never allow Aehrenthal to go to war.     In fact, Wekerlo it was who delayed the mobilisation being actually carried through and only allowed a notice announcing tho possibility of a rao-bilisation to be published at the moment when Sir Fairfax Cartwrighfc had already agreed with (then) Baron Aehrenthal as to the Belgrade demarche,Dr Wokerle will always make a point of being informed of all im-portanb documents that reach, or leave, the Vienna Foreign Office buu he will rarely pay them much attention.     Formerly it was his habit-to look at the Eallplatz mail only when stimulated by some important publication in the Pres3.     And he usod to esxrrise this lack of inter93 by Gaying:   &quot;The literary compositions of our diplomatists may be of great artistic value but I am not an art-critic;   tho loss I road of those reports the more I know.&quot;    Ee is one of the very few Hungarian statecmen who never quote English political examples;   England and France are terrae incognitae to him.     For him tho interest in any foreign country is limited by its capacity of absorbing Hungarian loans.Even a very cursory sketch of Dr. WekerleTs political personality would be incomplete without mentioning his well-establishod objection to -truthfulness, in so far as his own person is concerned.     This con-stitutional habit cf 3)r. WekerleTs was the only subject Francis Joseph I. was ever known to have joked about.     One day the Emperor listened toWekerle^s report with a rather seeptical attention.     Suddenly Francis Joseph interrupted his Prime Minister asking:   &quot;Whatrs the date to-day?&quot;   &quot;The 17th of April, Sire,1&quot;   The Emperor looked at the almanach on his desk and said smiling:    nWhy,Y.rekerle, it really is
tho 17thI&quot;   It is characteristic of -ekerle that he is very fond of relating this story always adding in his delightfully cynical way:   &quot;I never make a point of saying what is just true.     I have no objection to truth as long as it does not hurt my work.     But if it does, why, I command my utterings and not my utterings me.&quot; Which is another explanation of his success in Hungarian political life.To conclude:   V/ekerlo fcs a strong personality and he knows the ropes.     Hie personal charm has kept his popularity alive *     The Majority know him to be a good leader with an open hand.     Principle do not burden him.     Re is the only man capable of bringing order in tho chaos of Hungarian finances.    He has a good sporting chance. if not more, of success.
