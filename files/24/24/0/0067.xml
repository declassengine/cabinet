Cms- vr^-,, 239S?JJ AIR   BOARD.Keport to the Cabinet. Ib.153/30.-   1 25th August, 1917.lanisationi 1.     The report to the Cabinet of the 12th May statedthat the Admiralty had expressed their unwillingness to accept the arrangements proposed by the Ministry of liuni-tions by which that Ministry should be the source of the supply of aerial bombs to the two Servicesj the Admiralty being of opinion that all explosives for conveying In H.M. ships should be supplied by them.There are obvious disadvantages In a system by which bombs intended for the same purpose, and in many case3 of the same pattern, are supplied through separate Depart-ments which may act competitively on the market.     A fresh proposal has now been made by the Air Board for the ccnsti-tution of a committee representing the Director of Naval Ordnance, the Director General of Munitions Design, the ir-ench Warfare Department of the ministry of founitions and the Air Board, to settle all questions relative to the design, inspection and supply of these bombs and it is hoped that this may prove acceptable to the various depart -ments concerned.fceral Policy.      * 2.     The question of the type of aeroplane to be used &quot;&quot;for artillery reconnaissance In 1918 has been the subject of repeated consideration by the Board.     The machine known as the R.E.8 which was adopted last year, to replace the well known and much abused B.E. type, has not proved altogether satisfactory.     Though faster than the B-E. and better able to defend itself, it is not an easy machine to fly and has levied a considerable toll of life, particularly among pilots in course of training.     It had been hoped at one time that no change in this machine would be necessary until after the summer of next year, as the conversion of the very large number of artillery machines In service to a fresh type is a formidable undertaking.     Moreover, the substitution of the Bristol Fighter for the R.E.8, which is the substitution proposed, involves the appropriation to this service of some 1400 Hispano Suiza engines of 200 h.p. in place of an equivalent number of H.A.I. engines of 140 h.p.     Other employment perhaps, in connection with training, would have to be found for the latter.After full consideration, the Board have decided that the retention of the K.2.8, when a more satisfactory machine can be provided In Its place, would not be justi-fied and the substitution of the Bristol Fighter will begin next February and will be carried out from then onwards.fc^Iy* 3.
