From:-   General Barter, Russia. To:-      C.I.G.S., War Office.20th August 1917. 7.44 p.m.No. 1199.This morning C,.-in-C. sent for me nominally to confer on me the Order of Saint Vladimir, but really I believe to tell me how matters stand between Provisional Government and himself He informed me without reserve that Government is too weak to support his programme and dare not act.     He himself is determined to maintain his conditions and it was quite clear to me both from his attitude and from some veiled allusions which he made that he is out of patriotism considering e7wpediency of adopting, if necessary, a vigorous political initiative which, should foreign diplomatic action fail, is,, in his opinion, the. only/way to save the army and country.     One sentence especiall;-led me to this supposition.     He said Cossacks were ready to a man to act by force in support of his military policy.Kornilof has definitely decided to attend Congress at Moscow and has asked me to accompany him.     I shall take with me a secret code book and a staff officer.     I shall of course be most discreet and careful in my behaviour and shall be there as a privately interested visitor.1   He also gave strongest possible hint that he thinks-the only peaceable way to save situation both military and.political in Russia is the intervention of the Western Powers by means of diplomatic pressure.     It was perfectly evident that he ardently desired this diplomatic intervention but-wished to be able to declare if necessary that he had not solicited it.
I think it better not to give (one group undecipher-able) cipher my private opinion of what lie is prepared to do ?should this diplomatic alternative fail and to what result (one group undecipherable) personal his action vtould. lead.I venture emphatically to urge that if the allied Governments have the intention of exerting diplomatic pressure it should be applied without a day&apos;s delay.     I consider it of utmost importance that this effort should be made before the Congress at Moscow assembled on August 12th (sic).   I also consider it highly desirable that each of allied Governments should confer a high decoration on Kornilof telegraphicly to Russian Government through the Ambassadors at Petrograd.     This would constitute courteous yet clear evidence that they approved of military policy adopted by Komilof.Please furnish me with some indication of the policy of the British Government regarding these points for commun-ication with Kornilof0In the immediate future I will refer to Comman&amp;er-in-Chief as &quot;GRAIN11, this being the equivalent of corn the beginning of his name. &quot;      Please acknowledge.
