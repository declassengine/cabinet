353.    August 28th&quot;, .10 p.m.    Situation 2nd Army. 27th Army Corps is meeting with strong resistance on the Kal plateau, and has been strongly counter-attacked.    Its losses have been rather heavy, and General de jfarchi, commanding one brigade, has been killed.   Nothing speoial to report cn front of 14th and 24th Corps.    On front of 2nd and 6th Corps further progress has been made towards isolating San Gabriele, which was still resisting strongly.   On front of 8th Corps an attack was delivered on San Marco this morning after a four hours bombardment.   Some progress was made in the Panowitzer Wald, point 193 being reached.    There is however still very strong resistance. Generally speaking, enemy&apos;s artillery was not very active, but on the other hand he is making great use of mach^e-guns and Italian advance is being delayed until enough artillery can be brought up to deal with this obstacle.    It is known that on San Gabriele there are 7 battalions, some of which have already lost heavily, and an officer prisoner taken to-day states that the only means of communication was by a road passing behind San Daniele to Ternova and Nemoi, but that no food or ammunition had been able to be brought up for 5 days.    435 prisoners were captured by 8th Corps near San Marco, and about 300 partly on the Kal plateau and partly on San Gabriele,    Owing to difficulty of other communications Italians are using carrier pigeons from Bainsizza plateau to 2nd Army headquarters. 3rd Army.    Situation is stationary. 300 prisoners have been taken. It is now ascertained that Austrian 10th Division is definitely on the front of 3rd Army,  and has relieved the 35th Division. Of the.Austrian 11th Division it is reported that 95th Regiment is approaching the Isonzo front after resting.ThoughOperations. SECRET.From :-   General Delme Radoliffe,  Italy.C.I.G.S., War Office. 29.8.17.Handed in 7 a.m.
Though they are still offering a good resistance, the morale of the Austrian troops seems to show little improvement, and most prisoners are tired and complain of lack of food.    They also affirm that if Italians continue their pressure the Austrians will fall hack on the line Koilca-Lokva^Ternova-Schon Pass.     What may he called the second phase of the offensive will begin along the whole front as soon as the changes in artillery positions are completed.   About one million rounds of heavy ammunition have been expended in the first stage of the offensive, and there will be about 1,200,000 available for the next stage.     The prospects may consequently be considered good, as the enemy has lost heavily, is demoralised, has less well prepared defences, and his artillery cannot from its new positions be as effective as before.    Cadorna is determined to maintain pressure as long as he possibly can, and the troops are very keen.
