I 0 g g R. A IT 1 Q H 8.../ From:-   C.X.6.S. To:-      General Van Deventer, G.K.Q, Bast Africa.15th August, 1917. 7.30.p.m.39616 cipher.The idea has occurred to me that the mishap to 30th Punjabis may have &quot;been owing to lack of experience in bueh fighting.   1 am well acquainted with Indian troops and they are quite unused to such warfare and cannot quickly adapt themselves td new conditions.    In all theatres we have found that time spent in training troops for the special conditions of each particular theatre is well repaid by results.   1 do not know what has been done in this respect in Bast Africa or whether any special arrangements have been made for the   purpose by your Staff.   Please give me your observations. I send this with special reference to new Indian units shortly to be expected from that country,0.1.0.8. (1)D.H..

op m ATi oim.From:-     General Vandeventer, To (3.1,0.8.8.35 a*nuYour 39616    Lust i)eo ember the 3Qth Punjabis! arrived from India went :^aigfet-te the front and took part in Mgkta Rufiti.advance under General Sheppard in January and were the fir&amp;t unit to croeu the Hufiti in face of strong opposition. The regiment did well.     They were? in training camp at foregoro during rains.     Later on they took part in t&amp;e pursuit of Wintgens.     Tho Regir-ent was considered an oxperiencod unit when it went to Lindi.     The mishap occurred primarily through the regiment penetrating too far behind the enemy&apos;s lines and thus becoming ieolated.     I believe regiment would have rendered a good account of itself had practically ell its British Officers not been killed or wounded in the first counter-attack.   Shortage of British Officers in Indian regiments is serious drawback. Regiment went into action on this occasion *ith only 8 British Officers of whom ssore than half were Indian Army He serve Officers.-So jaany unite as possible wore withdrawn during rains to Morogoro where regular training took plane. Machine gun and trench mortar school was also established there.    But now that active operations ar? in progress special training by units is difficult in this country.     It is1essential to land new unite at fighting detitinaiione owing to shipping difficulties, and to keep a Regiment training in Lindi or Kilwa areas;   even a rsonth would result in the loss of considerable portion of its strength before it had fireda
a shot.    Moreover all fit men who are urgently required at front.     The most practical method has been found to be, to give a new unit a few days preliminary training and then to send it to the front to be used in reserve until it learns its work.     Both officers and men are thus able to see bush trained regiments actually at work and can discuss important points at first hand.     Byery opportunity is utied of utilizing halts in same way.     In the case of the new Indian units now arriving I propose to adopt this method.C.I.G.S.(2).D.M.I.Colonial Office. India Office.D.M.O. ?f.0.1. u * 0 * 2 *H.G.2.b. -.0.3.
