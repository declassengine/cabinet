Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.CRV;/019.WEEKLY REPORT OI:T RUSSIA. XIX.(27 August, 1917).The Moscow Conference.All interest in Russia is now centred on the Moscow Conference.thanks very largely to Italian successes against Austria and the ever increasing pressure on the Western front.   This is a godsend to Russia at the present moment, as any further military failure would tend to cloud the real issues at stake and produce an atmosphere of such excitement that an open conflict at Ivioscovv would be difficult to avoid.The present Moscow Conference is a very different thing to that proposed by Kerenski last month vhen he was forming his new Government The original conference was to have been called to unite the nation and give moral support to the Government by calling together all classes.     During the last few months, however, the position of the various parties has undergone a change.     Last July the prospects of an understanding seemed brighter, and the inclusion of four Cadets in the Ministry was welcomed as a good omen.     Unfortunately the Central Committee of the Cadet party has not acted In the spirit of the Coalition and has been steadily widening the breach between the bourgeoisie and the Socialists..     In the last Report mention was made of the efforts of the Extreme Left of the bourgeoisie to support Kerenski in building a bridge between the various classes by getting together a moderate central block thatcould keep in touch both with the Cadets and the Socialists. Kerenski was recognised as the only man who was likely to succeedFortunately the Russian armies are having a breathing space,
2.in so difficult a task, and he has done everything possible to give offence to neither side.    This is the real explanation of his attitude towards the Stockholm Conference.     In expressing his opinions he has spoken as the Prime Minister of a Coalition Govern-ment and not as a private individual, hut there Is little doubt that at heart he still remains a Socialist, and if any clash should come between the Cadets and Socialists he will in all probability throw in his lot with the latter.     Indeed, the controversy about the Stockholm Conference has already made this clear.     While Cadets and Socialists were disputing in their press about the rights and wrongs of the Conference, Kerenski rather ostentatiously visited the C.W.S.D., inhere he made a conciliatory speech.     It was significant that his reception was less cordial than it had been hitherto and that Kamenev (a Maximalist) was able to secure a hearing for a Violent attack on the Government.     Kerenski&apos;s presence was a sign that the Government v/as not willing to break with the C.W.S.D., while Kamenev&apos;s speech was a sign that the C.W.S.D. were not willing to break with the Maximalists..The attitude of the C.T-.S.D. was evidently due to the action of those parties to the Right of the Government who have Veen . holding meetings both in public and in private, and have been speaking with no uncertain voice as to what they intended to do. The best organised party to the Right of the Government is that of the Cadets, for the Cadets as a party have not joined Kerenski. The Cadets are an extremely well-organised party and contain the best known figures in Russian political life.     The party is chiefly composed of, or at any rate led by, professional men -lawyers, professors, doctors, etc. - while in Hoscow it has a largo following amongst the leading business men.     Members of the party outside the Duma have also done excellent work both in the Zemetvoe
and the Town Councils.       It was hoped that this party would combine with the Radicals and Moderate Socialists in forming a central block, opposing the extreme elements both to the Right and to the Left.     Unfortunately such hopes have not been realised. In justification of the Cadets it must be admitted that they were violently, and often unfairly, attacked by the Socialists in the early stages of the Revolution.     This was in large part due to the hostility of the Socialists towards Liilyukov and his -insistence about Constantinople;   but his enormous Influence with his party meant that no distinction could be made between his personal opinions and the policy of his party.     The original conflict between HilyukoY and the Socialists was on questions of foreign policy, but it has now been embittered by internal questions.The two most burning questions are the land question and the&apos; Industrial question.     ChernovTs land programme is considered by nearly all parties to1be disastrous.   It will undoubtedly secure support amongst large numbers of the peasants, as it means the abolition of private property and the division of the land amongst the peasants.   The village commune is to be the nucleus and each peasant is to receive from the commune as much land as he can work himself.   The objections to this programme come not only from tho landowners and all the parties supporting them, but also from different provinces of Russia where agrarian conditions are different from what they are in central Russia.   The latter object to it on the ground that no agrarian project which applies to Russia as a whole can be a success.     The country will have to be divided into districts and each district will require a separate project of Its own.   Por example, it is probably correct to say that the hostility of the Cossacks and of the Ukraine to the
Provisional-Government is to a large extent due to Chernov&apos;s land programme.Thus the Cadets, who   stand to the Right of the Government, can rely on the support both of the landowners and of the industrialists.   This means that the Cadets In opposing the Government will be drawn more and more towards the Right and. will tend to lose their character as a party with advanced liberal ideas.     They have given no outward sign of wishing to restore the Monarchy, though there are several indications that a Monarchist movement has been growing.   The Socialist press has written of a paper called Groza (Threat), which has boon secretly circulated in the country districts.   It- is sold at the low price of 2 kopeks and is meant to prepare the peasantry for the return of a Tsar.     AnqMbher indication is the removal of the late Tsar to Tobolsk, and it is rumoured that there was a definite plot to rescue him from Tsarskoye Selo.   It is, of course, impossible to say what support there is for such underground movements, as no responsible political party has declared against the Republic.     A recent meeting, however, of the Duma that was presided over by Rodzianko showed that the irritation of the bourgeois parties was rising and that they were.gaining in confidence.     Maslennikov, formerly a Progressive, and Purishkevich, the well-known member of the Extreme Right, both made violent speeches against all the Councils of Workmen both in the capital and in;the provinces.     According to the Socialist press Rodzianko and Milyukov, who also spoke, tried to pour oil on the troubled waters, but the Socialist press took alarm, and the growing confidence of the Duma has accentuated the9opposition of the Socialists.Such is the atmosphere in which the Moscow Conference now meets. The main questions are political,  and their acutencss is due to
class rivalry.     The military question, in which General Kcrnilov is concerned, :is secondary, though, if the bourgeois parties fail to get what they want, they may appeal to the discontented army leaders to attempt a coup dretat.     It is impossible to prophesy what will happen during the next few days.   Kerenski, in his opening speechj has made the attitude of the Government unmistakeablo. His speech means that, if the bourgeois parties attempt a coup . d&apos;etat, the Government, backed by the Socialists, will fight for It. His references to Finland show that the Government are not neglectful of the vital interests of Russia.   It is to be hoped that the differences between PCerenski and Kornilov will not be aggravated by the former&apos;s political rivals.   Kcrenski undoubtedly desires to see the restoration of the fighting powers of the army just as much as Kornilov does, and in the main the two aro in agreement, Kerenski&apos;s slowness is due to political reasons and his desire to prevent any drastic measures which might provoke bloodshed within the   country on a large scale.   Kerenski has now shown his hand; the next week will show what sort of reply his political oppenents and the army leaders intend to make.27,8.17* RAL.
