As the steel position did not permit &quot;of the necessary allotment being made to all shipbuilding,, &quot;the steel was distributed; pending consideration of&apos; the^question, tcyfchose&quot;- Vessels which would give the quickest &quot;return in available tonnage.     The present, position, is; &quot;that 2,000 tons of steel have been worked into the &quot;double-bottom,1,000 tons is delivered to the yard andAltogether 14,700 tons will be required to construct, the &quot;vessel.&quot;The view of the Admiralty and Shipping Controller on &quot;the question is contained in Admiralty Memorandum of 11th &quot;August, and is adverse to the construction of mammoth ships. &quot;Under these circumstances, the Admiralty ask that the &quot;dbcicion of the&apos;-Jar Cabinet (Mo.130, Minute 18 may be &quot;reversed.   -A .G.
