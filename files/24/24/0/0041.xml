Award of medals for the -present warMemorandum by the Secretary, of State for War.The question of the award of medals for the present w^r-has not only engaged the attention of the &quot;Army Council but was the subject of discussion at the Imperial Conference.     The general opinion would seem to be that two medals should be issued, one bei-g&quot;&quot;ari International medal for all troops engaged in theatres of war and the other a British medal for all troops serving at home and In garrisons.    Troops serving in theatres of war would also be entitled to the British medal.With regard to clasps, the Army Council were first of opinion that these should not record actions or localities but-only the calendar years of the duration of the war.     This view, however, was challenged by the ITew Zealand representatives at the Imperial Conference and there is also a considerable body of feeling against it in the Army itself,     In these circumstances the Army Council recommend that the question of the description and allotment of clasps should be referred to a Committee of \ representatives from all theatres of war to be held at the close of&quot;hostilities..    .The navy propose to adopt the same procedure as the Army.Without touching on questions of detail, I must point out that something like twelve to fifteen million medals will ?aave to be prepared and that on the cessation of hostilities there will be a very strong and general, desire on the part of the public for an early distribution of medals.     It would appear that 25 machines can engrave the .names on about 3,500,000 medals in a year, and it might be possible to get the medals out in about a year after the cessation of&apos; hostilities,The Army Council have considered questions of raanufact-ure and issue and are of opinion, after consultation with the tttnt that if the issue of the medals is not to be unduly delayed a decision on the following questions should be arrived at:-(a) WhetJier the medals shall be of silver or if not of what metal.    The Imperial Conference favoured silver medals.     The approximate weight .of a medal is 1 oz,and the cost of 1,000,000 oz, of silver at present market price would be about  172,000.&apos;.(b) Whether, if it ,iB decided that the medalB are to be of silver, the. Royal Mint shall be approached with a view to purchase-being commenced at once.    The purchaseshould spread over a considerable period in order to-avoid undue inflation of the pr^oe of silver and the *;-consequent dislocation of the world*s silver coinage. The silver when purchased would be cut at the Royal Mint into &quot;blanks&quot;, that is circular pieces of silver prepared for striking into medals. The blanks would be stored at the Royal Mint: for issue to Contractors.
(c) Whether the War Office shall prepare the draft schedule for issue to selected contractors.     The contractors would tender for striking medals, &quot;bars&apos;and clasps,-and it would he specified in the contracts that the &quot;blanks and tools shall &quot;be supplied by the Royal Hint. This would involve purchase of steel,(d) Whether the necessary steps should be taken at once with a viow to obtaining specimen designs of the medals and clasps.When once a deeteion on these points has been arrived at, :the matter can be put in hand and steps taken to expedite in every way possible the manufacture and issue as soon as hostilities have oeased,I would therefore ask the War Cabinet to approve that(l)   The war medal or medals to be issued, eventually should be made of silver,(2)   Steps should be taken at once to obtain specimen &apos;  designs,(3)   The Royal Mint should be authorised to commence at once the necessary purchase&apos; of silver,(4)   Schedule should be prepared on which to base invita-tions to selected contractors to tender for the supply of medals, bars and clasps,(5)   The decision of the Army. Council as to clasps should be endorsed.24th August, 1917.DERBY.
