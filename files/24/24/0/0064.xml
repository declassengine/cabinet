. 189J6Pensions.The number of pensions granted during the week toofficers and men, and to widows, children and dependants (Table I) was 11,282 against 10,030 last week and 0,708 the week before.   Since the beginning of the war 785,244 pensions, including childrenfe allowances, have been awarded.Table II shows that last week 40 grants of supplementarypensions and special allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 36 in the previous week.   The total number to date is 4354.2. The number Qf fresh claims to pension      disabledsoldiers dealt with by the Awards to Soldiers Branch during thr week ending 22nd August was 4,600 as compared with 4,000 during the previous week, and 3,800 during the week before.Of the 4,800 cases 3,091 were disposed of by the award of pension, permanent or temporary, and 1,693 by the grant of gratuities, and in 10 cases the claims were rejected. Claims which had previously been rejected under former Warrants were admitted in 127 cases, 97 of the men being granted gratui-ties and 30 pensions.   The total number of claims previously rejected which have been-dealt with up to date is 6,713 of which 1,011 have been met by tho award of pension and 5,702 by gratuities.3. The work of awarding and authorising payment ofWidows and Dependants pensions in current cases is completely up to date.made during the week against 2,092 last week and 2,580 the week before.   There remain 24,901 cases to be dealt with.(Appendix I).3,026 re-assessments of dependants pensions were
(Appendix I).   The 3,026 cases this week include 1,966 dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have benefitted by the re-assessment to the average extent of 3/ld a week, and 182 dependent parents whoso cases had been settled by a gratuity under.&quot;the Old Warrant but have nor/ boon placed on pension at an average rate of 7/3d a week.   The rest of the 3,026 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependence.As a result of the week1a re-examinations as to entitlement under the liew warrant 41 widows not previously helped have been admitted to full pension, and 36 to temporary pension, while in 32 cases it has not been found possible to give help,   ilo depondant has been admitted to pension or gratuity and 2 have been-finally refused.   137 (widows and dependants) remain to -lie dealt with out of tho original total of 4723*.        (Appendix II). 4. 27,000 authorities for payment of the  5 grants incases of death on or after 1st July, 1916, notified before 4th April, 1917, have been sent to the issue office.   About 12,000 have still to be sent.The issue of the Z2 balances duo in cases notified since 4th April has now been completed.   Payment of the  5 in the earlier cases is proceeding cxpeditioualy.Treatment5. An interesting report from the Joint InstitutionalCommittee of the Ministry and Dritieh tied Cross Societycovering the past six months 1 operations is given inAppendix III.   It will be seen that substantial progress hasbeen made towards meeting the deficiencfcsadtf institutionalaccommodation for those special casos of injury and mentalor nervous affections, namely, neurasthenia, epilepsy^* The number given previously as approximately 4,523 Tfas understated by about 200paraplegia
paraplegia, and advanced tuberculosis, which have come into special prominence during tho war and for which existing provision was found inadequatet   Private generemttjr has met the efforts of tho Joint Committee in a most satisfactory manner.6.      Some discussion has arisen in the Lancashire public press in regard to the treatment of men discharged from service on account of insanity.   The arrangements made by the Ministry with the Board of Control provide for the treatment of such cases after admission to an asylum, as private patients under thfc  title of rService Patients1 with special privileges, the cost of ifcich is charged to the Ministry.    Under the existing law, however, a man discharged from service on account of insanity is made chargeable to the poor law and is in the first instance admitted to an asylum as a pauper lunatic, and, further, he remains in this position until declared (on notification by the Asylum to the Ministry) to be entitled to be classed as a service patient.    This procedure is much resented in many quarters and questions have been addressed to the Minister in the House of Commons on the point.     The Ministry have made representations to the V/ar Office and Admiralty with a view to arranging that a man shall in all cases be sent under Military Escort to an asylum and appli-cation has been made to the Treasury to enable the Ministry to defray the cost of the man&apos;a maintenance during the interval of a week or    fortnight from the date of admission until the question of his title to be classed as a eervico patient has been determined.------ .. - - -     - . &quot;.&apos; .     - - ... - &apos;        ......    . &apos; - - - - .7. The Army Council have Issued an Instruction(IJo. 1289 iledical Boards on neurasthenic Officers) dealing with the invaliding from the Army of Officers who are no longer likely to be fit for military service by reason of shell shock, neurasthenia, functional nervous disorders orepilepsy.
epilepsy.    The re-examination of officers invalided for one of the above disabilities, with a view to the renewal of their retired pay, will be arranged at the request of the Ministry of Pensions by the President of the Special Medical Board dealing with the case.    A copy of the Instruction is given as Appendix IV.0. A suggestion has been made in the press (Times22nd August) for the treatment of neurasthenic cases by means of boarding out in homes.     The proposal is being carefully considered by the Ministry in consultation with Sir J. Collie.      The suggested mode of treatment would apply for obvious reasons only to the less severe forms of neurasthenia when little more than convalescent treat-ment was required with careful selection of tho homes and of the cases sent to them there seems no reason why an experiment in this direction should not be successful. 9. Prom the weekly return received from theSpecial Medical Board it appears that the number of neurasthenic cases receiving treatment in the Home at Solders Green and under arrangements made in farm campa wera on the 22nd instant as followss-In the Home, Goldors Green 7$ At &apos;;itham Farm Cam;, 1510. Under the special arrangements made by theMinistry with the Manager of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the treatment of advanced cases of tuberculosis among discharged soldiers. 22 men are under treatment in the hospital allocated by the Managers for this purpose during the week ended 22nd August.11. With a view to assisting Local Committees toavail themselves for the purpose of the treatment of dls-charged men of all existing institutional accommodationin
in the county, lists of the available military and auxiliary hospitals have been sent to each Local Committee with a circular letter advising them to cooperate in the matter through the agency of the newly established Joint (Disablement) Committees.      A copy of this.circular is given in Appendix V.    At the same time the Ministry&apos;h Representatives in the several Joint Committee areas have been advised of this step and instructed to take the initiative in approaching the chief local officers of the .^rmy Medical Service, the Auxiliary hospital system, and the Medical Officers of Hsalth with a view to making the arrangements with the various institutions as complete as possible.x2. Appendix VI. shows the arrangements for treat-ment for which general sanction was asked by Local Committees during the week ended 22nd August.     Owing no doubt to the holiday season the proposals are few in number 13. Appendix VII. shows that 114 cases were admittedto treatment during the week ended 22nd instant of v4iich 101 were treated in hospitals and other institutions.     The total number of cases reported as under treatment at the end of the week was 356.    There is however good reason for thinking that the returns are not yet complete. 14. Appendix VIII. shows that in 74 individual casesoutside general schemes of treatment sanction was given to special treatment.Training.15. Agricultural Training **   Useful conferences havebeen held this week between the iiinistry of Pensions and representatives of the Doards of Agriculture of England andScotland
Scotland which give promise of substantial progressjtowards the training of disabled men in agricultural work.    Reports of these conferences are given in Appendix VI The general conclusion arrived at is that as regards general farm work there is at $he.present time and is likely to be after the war considerable opening for men on farms but that the work of a general farm labourer is necessarily heavy and as it renders a man liable to continual exposure is not suitable except *o a relatively small proportion of disabled men.    Moreover it is not anticipated, oven with the minimum wages offered under recent arrangements made by the Government, that there will be any greater inclination than before on the part of townsmen to adopt this form of employment.    At the same time there are subsidiary forms of farm work such,as dairying and cow-keeping for which disabled men can be trained and in which, with training, a man may rely on getting a good wage, and in agricultural districts it may well be found that training in these occu* patIons can advantageously be provided.Prospects of training and employment in such branches of market gardening as fruit farming and growing f*f fruit and vegetables under glass were, It was agreed, far more favourable.     Training should be given to the disabled men by private employers, but, while the man would only In the Immediate future look forward to be a wage earner, experience had shown that it was far from difficult for a man to acquire and run a small market garden holding on his own account.There is ir- doubt much feeling at the present time in the direction of encouraging the resettlement on the land of discharged men as small holders but, except underfavourable
1 qr)1 *j ufavourable conditions, it was agreed that the-experiment was not likely to succeed.    For success three conditions are essential:-(1)   Applicants must bo selected by an agricultural expert j(2)   They must be given definite instruction according to the particular form of cultivation for which the locality and the man are most suitable;   and(3)    here must be a reasonable prospect of the man being able to make a permanent livelihood out of the land and for this purpose a man must either have or see the prospect of a small capital or have some ot :er standby in the shape of a remunerative occupation in addition to his holding.The provision of small holdings in particular has been discussed with the Board of Agriculture for Scotland who are inclined to view with favour a scheme put forward by the west of Scotland Agricultural College for the develop-ment, by way of small holdings, of land adjoining villages in certain agricultural districts of Scotland.      In view of the success of small holdings in many districts of Scotland the scheme is probably one that the Ministry of Pensions can support but subject to the above conditions.As a result of Conferences with the Board of Agriculture particularly with respect to the scheme proposed by the County borough of Uorwich f er the training of men in certain forms of agricultural work, that Board are applying to the Treasury for sanction to apply their Farm Institute regulations to urban areas whore the conditions as in Norwich, are suitable for co-operation between a County Borough and the Council of an agricultural county.ic        &apos;&apos;
men for industrial omployment in Ireland has for a variety of reasons, local and political, not progressed as favour-ably as in other parts of the Kingdom.      As a first stop towards interesting employers and labour in training, a Committee has been formed consisting of one representative of each of the federations of employers in Dublin and of oach of the unions of workpeople affiliated to the Trades Council.    This Committee, acting by small representative panels, will consider all applications from men for train-ing with a vdjow to determining thoir suitability fcr tho trade selocted and the openings for employment In it.Meetings of two Central Trade Advisory Committees have been hold in the wook ended 22nd instant, namely those of the Cinematograph trade cad of tlie Leather Goods Manufacture17. Appendix X shows general schemes of trainingsubmitted or doalt with during the week.   The output is relatively small owing mainly, as was pointed out in last weekrs report, to the holiday season.   The slacker time, is, however, being used to put the newly established Joint Committees in possession of all the information available to tie Binistsy, not only as to the schemes of training already instituted In their areas but, also as to the technical institutions oxisting in the aro&amp;s which have not hitherto been utilised and as to the occupations special to their areas.     The attention of Joint Committees is also being called to thoso Local Committocs which have not as yot shown that they are fully alive to the importance of providing training. &apos;18. Appendix XI shows that 47 men were admitted totraining by Local Committees or otherwise during the weekended
ended 22nd instant, and also indioates the occupations in which the training is being given.19. Appendix XII shows that in 34 Individual casesnot covered by general schemes sanction was given to the training of disabled men during the week.Organisation.20. A statement of the proceedings of the StatutoryCommittee for the week ending 22nd August, 1917, is-annexed (Appendix XIII).     The Inspectors of Account report that the Lancashire Sub-Committees are framing well but lack experience, that Carlisle Local Committee is making efficiency subservient to economy, that the work at Blackpool, where disabled men are numerous, is satisfactory. Barry Local Committee, not wofcl reported on last May, appears to have got out of hand, whilst the Secretaries of the Essex District Committees show a disinclination to carry out the duties for which they were appointed.    The Birmingham Local Committee shows great interest in the work and Is prepared to take over further duties;   Swansea devotes more energy to payments than to training;   there is an enthusiastic report on the work of the Local Committees of the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire, whilst the report on the East and South bast Midland counties is on the whole Vj satisfactory.21* In the Report for the period from 23rd to29th June last reference was made to a Bill to provide for U transfer of the powers, duties and functions of the Statutory Committee to the Minister of Pensions and the Patriotic Fund Corporation, and a full explanation of its genesis and contents was given.     In the course of its progress through Parliament various amendments were made chief of which was the substitution of a small committee for the Patriotic FundCorporation.
Corporation.    The Bill bee me law on the 21st Augustas the ITaval and Military (Transfer of Powers) Act, 1917.By Section 1 it is enacted that as from a date to be fixed by Hie Majesty by Order in Council the Statutory Committee shall be dissolved and on the 22nd instant an Order in Council (Appendix XIV) was issued fixing September 1st as the date from which the Statutory Committee should be dissolved and as from which the ofcher provisions of the Act 6hould take effect.In these circumstances the Statutory Committee have issued to Local Committees a circular (Ho. 60) draw-lng attention to the.changes effected by the Act.    The Committee take the opportunity of expressing their warm appreciation of the services rendered by Local Committees and their officers and mafte special reference to Voluntary Workers.      The circular forms Appendix XV * 22* The Joint Committees for treatment and trainingformed under the authority of section 2 (8) of the ITaval and Military War Pensions Act, 1915, to assist the Local Committees now cover the whole area of the United ICingdow, i^or England and V/alee there are 13 Joint Committees, for Scotland 4 and for Ireland 3,    k list of these Committees containing $he various Local Committees which have combined to form them and the names and addresses of the local Representatives of the Ministry is given in Appendix XVI. 2*. On the resignation of Mr. Arthur Henderson fromthe War Cabinet Mr. George Barnes took his place there as the Representative of labour and on the 17th Instant Mr. .7. Hodge was appointed MiniEter of Pensions.     In quitting the Pensions Office Mr. Barnes wrote expressing his sincere ouanks to the Staff for their great help and assistance and asked for his successor the same&quot;invaluable aid and counsel?
&quot;We may, I think&quot;, ha continues &quot;congratulate ourselves upon the achievements of the last few months.    .7* have laid a few stones of the foundation of a great department which has already dons and will yet do more to bind up the wounds of those who have done, so much for us at the&apos;P*o&amp;t*.&apos; and also for their dependants&quot;.Staff etc.24. Table 111 shows an addition of 01 to the staffof the Ministry during the week, 6 having been added to the Administration, 05 to the Awards to Soldiers Branch and 27 to the Awards to widows Branch, whilst in the Pension Issue Office where there are now 110 holiday workers to replace girls on their annual leave there is a decrease of 27.   The staff on the books of the Ministry now comprises 101 men and 3800 women, *ar 3990 in all.

G.IT.Barnes, II.P.,minister of Pensions being present.A sum of  20,000 was placed at the disposal of theCommittee by the Joint Committee of the Red Cross and Orderof St, John and subsequently a further sum of  10,000 wassimilarly placed for capital expenditure in connection withInstitutions,   The following were appointed as advisers of the,Committee on Special branches of the work!:--Neurasthenia Epilepsy Tuberculosis(Advanced cases .&apos;.J-;:raplc.yia/ananceTho Committee confines itself to initiatory, co-ordinating, advisory and supervisory functions. The actual management and administration of Institutions being done&quot;by local - Committees or supervised by local ..uthorities,A number of houses and Institutions have been offered to the Com .Ittee for the Establishment of Homes of Recovery and treatment and in eaoh case have been inspected and reported on as to their suitability by the Special Medical Advisers in their respective Departments.   In setting up Institutions in various parts of the country tho Committee not only aims at providing the necessary medical care and treatment but also wherever possible at providing healthy outdoor work and suitable training for those of the Patients who are able to undertake light work during the course of their treatment. Assistance with regard to after treatment i3 regarded by the Committee as being of the utmost importance, neurasthenics:   A Home of Recovery for the treatment of Heurasthenia and other functional diseases of the Nervous system in the case of discharged soldiers and sailors has beenopened
opened at Higtifield Oolders Green.   At the present time there are 82 patients in the Institution and. 182 awaiting admission.   Steps arc already being taken to provide accommodation for a further fifty ceses.A camp has been established at Pithom, Essex, where the Patients live in tents and are allotted light outdoor work.   At the present time there are ton tents there and sack accommodates three patients.Arrangements have been completed for the establishment of a Home at Leicester Frith, Leicester, with accommodation for 100 beds.   The cost of establishing and equipping this Institution Is being borne out of a fund raised by the Llr.yor of Leicester in addition to which the building is given free of rent.Arrangements have also been completed for a home at Alierton Hall, Leeds, to accommodate at lcsat 100 beds.Hr. John Leigh has placed his house and landat Altrincham at tho disposal of the Ministry and is upfitting/and equipping it at his own expense.   Ho is also arranging for tho establishment of a garden for Intonsivo Trench Culture in connection with the Institution. Accommodation will be provided for up po 100 Patfonts.The establishment of other   Institutions is at present under consideration.   A plant for   Intensive Culture is installed at the Home of Recovery, Golders Green, and it is proposed to make this Institution the model for all neurasthenic Institutions in the Country. A House of Recovery has also ben opened at Craig Avoz;, Belfast, but the arrangements in this case were made not by the Institutional Committee but by the Ministry and the Ulster Volunteer Committee.
Acting on the advice of Sir John Collie, the Adviser on Neurasthenics, the Committee has decided that it is absolutely necessary for the success of this class of Institution that it should have a resident Medical Officer In charge and tfc&amp;t no Institution should be officially recognised which does not provide accomnodation for at least 50 beds.Epileptics:     Accommodation to the extent of 306 beds has been provided or is d:i course of provision especially for discharged sailors and soldiers who are in need of Institutional Treatment for epilepsy&apos; as follows:-Three cottage homes each to accommodate1 twenty-five men at Chalfont Colony, Guards Cross, Ouclcs,   Two cottage homes each with accommodation for 40 men at Lingfield Colony, Surrey;   there are also workshops at this Colony.   A Villa for 45 men at Uonyhull Colony,   &apos; Birmingham.   82 beds at Kaghull Colony, near Liverpool and 24 beds at the Dovid Lewis Colony, Alderley, Cheshire. Negotiations are in progress for meeting similar need in Scotland and the Scottish Institutional Committee has this In hand.   Consideration is also being given as to the extent to which it m,*r/ be necessary to provide corresponding accommodation in Ireland and in those districts of England and !Vales which are Inconveniontly remote from the above mentioned colonies, it being recognised that reasonable proximity of such centres for treatment and training to the homes and friends of the men is highly deslrrblo.Tuberculosis:     The Management of the Hetropolitan Asylums Board have provided 150 bods for advanced cases of Tuberculosis placing at the disposal of the Committoo a pavilion 3hould it be required in each of seven of their
Hespitals. At the present time two pavilions providing accommodation for 32 beds are open for the reception of patients and twenty seven tods are occupied.Arrangements have been made for accommodation for 50 patients at Brierley Hall, Bradford, and for a lien on 30 beds for advanced and Colony cases at the Cambridgeshire Tuberculosis Colony at Papworth Hall, Provision is being made for the erection of pavilions in various parts of the Country which are regarded as suitable localities for advanced cases. Major H. S. Hartley. C.V.0.:, the Committee&apos;s adviser on Tuberculosis .advocated the building of small Pavilions in connection with County fever Hospitals or Sanatoria. A Plan for a Standard Pavilion has been approved which has the advantage of fitting in with existing organisa-tions and gives an opportunity of placing patients near their own homes.   The liability of the Ministry is fixed at 35/- per occupied bed per week the Local authority being responsible for upkeep and. maintenance. Paraplegics;   Prior to the constitution of this Committee provision had been made at the Star and Oarter Home, Richmond, for accommodation for 64 patients of this class.Lonsdale Hov.se has been established with accommodation for 25 patients and is really used as a clearing house for London.Up to the 30th June last 3i  Paraplegic cases had been dealt with and placed in various Institutions which had put beds at the Committees disposal, and in some cases T?here considered advisable patients wore transferred to their own homes.The Committee has given consideration to the question of Pensions and deductions in the cases of menIn
in Military Hospitals and Institutions and as to the distinction between permanent and temporary, cases of treat-ment and the question of pocket money to the men.   The following recommendations were made to the Ministry.-(a) That in the case of Paraplegics it was not practicable to determine before any treatment had been given whether the case was curable or likely to need permanent treatment.(b) That all cases should be given treatment with full allowances to the men for six months but that at the end of that time the allowances should be reduced and the case treated as a permanent one unless the Minister was satisfied by a Medical Certificate that the case was likely to derive benefit by a further temporary stay in the Institution.(c) That in all Paraplegic cases a deduction of 7/- a week from the man&apos;s allowance should be made and applied towards the cost of his maintenance.   Tho deduction in the case of the Star and Garter should be made by the Ministry and paid to the Institution.(d) Pocket Honey.     The question of what amount was to be allowed to men in Institutions was discussed at length, and it was recognised as very desirable in all Paraplegic cases that the amount should be the same.It was considered that in paraplegic cases tho superintendents would certainly advise that l&quot;o/* * week be paid to tho man, and the Committee agreed to this.   The balance would be credited to him unless he deeided to make an allotment to his wife, but In any case he should be definitely informed that the balance was credited to him if not so allotted.   It was considered advisable that the Instruction should be brought to the men&apos;s notice and sent to those applying to be transferred.This
This arrangement has had to be slightly modified since to meet the wishes of the Treasury.The work of Technical Instruction af British Soldiers interned In Switzerland which has just begun is being done under the auspioes of the Committee.
APPENDIX IV. fPOB OFFICIAL USE ONLY.] 20!ARMY COUNOIL INSTRUCTION. No. 1289 of 1917.War Office,19th August, 1917.jl2S9, Medical Boards on Neurasthenic Officers.1. It has been decided that all officers recommended for aliding from the Army on account of shell shock, neurasthenia, iinctional nervous disorders and epilepsy, shall, before their inquishment is finally decided upon, be examined by the Special Hedical Board of Officers of the li.A.M.0., whose headquarters are 178, Lancaster Gate, London, W. 2.2. When, therefore, a medical board is of the opinion that an officer who is suffering- from one of the above-mentioned disorders is not likely to be fit for any further military service, the president will at once forward all medical documents of the officer as follows:    .(a) in the London District, to the President of the Special Medical Board, 78, Lancaster Gate, W. 2.(b) in other Commands, to the D.D.M.S. of the Command, whowill arrange for the documents to be available for the Special Medical Board when examining the officer.He will at the same time forward a nominal roll of all such cases which are not considered fit for further military service, giving the diagnosis of the disability, and the address of the officer, to the President of the Special Medical Board.3. The President of the Special Medical Board will arrange, in the case of officers in the London District with the officer in charge of the hospital concerned, and in the case of other commands with the D.D.M.S. of the command, for the officers attendance. The Board will examine the officer and, if they approve of his invaliding from the service, add their report and assess the officers physical disablement in lOths, i.e., 100 per cent, or total; 80 per cent., GO per(b 13123-1186)  16m  8/17  H &amp; s A. 17/1186

APPENDIX V.UIlilSTRY Oj7 PEHSIOHS, &quot;.&apos;eflt::iinster House/ Liillbcjilc,LONDON * S.*&apos;.l.Sir,I am directed.by the Minister of tensions to advert to Instruction 8 of the Instructions for the treatment and training sf disabled men and to forward a list of the hospitals (Military and Auxiliary) known to the Ministry in the area of the administrative County in order to assitt your Committee in drawing up the comprehensive statement of the arrangements for institutional treatment in their area.   For this purpose I am to suggest (in accordance with the remarks on page 88 of the Instructions &amp; Notes) that your Committee should work in co-operation with other Local Conmittees in the area of the Joint (Disablement) Committee and through that Joint Committee, so that a comprehensive statement covering the whole joint area may be submitted to the Minister.   The Joint Disablement Committee, to which has been delegated by your Committee the duty af concerting arrangements for treatment, and the Minister4s representative in the joint area will be in a position to render valuable assistance, with the help of the representatives of the Medical profession on the Joint Committee VThe statement should be so framed as to show the several hospitals grouped according to their respective capacities for the treatment of cases as indicated in the several columns on the enclosed statement and the terms on which patients can be treated In them.The terms on which arrangements for institutional treatment should be arranged should net exceed th*?se stated in Schedule I to the Instructions unless fcr any special classof
of ease higher terms are quite clearly just i.f led.The statement should he supplemented hy theaddition of(a) the civil hospitals, general and special Including cottage hospitals for each of which the same Inform-ation is required  as   in the ease of the military and auxiliary hospitals and(b) those special institutions outside the Joint Area which will occasionally be required for use, e.g. for erthopaedlc treatment, the treatment for the affections of the eye .or ear, special limbless cases, neurasthenics, convalescents, &amp;e.With the assistance of the eompleted list when the arrangements proposed have been approved by the Minister, the necessary treatment of cases can be readily given by your Committee (directly or through sub-committeea so far the Committee may see fit to delegate powers) without the delay Involved in obtaining Special Sanction or in searching for the institution appropriate to the case.   For this purpose the statement should be as exhaustive as it can be made.I am to add that similar statements are being forwarded to the other Local Committees in the Joint CommitteeTs area, to the Joint Committee itself, and to the Ministerfs Representative, and I am to express the hope that no time will be Xosh in completing and submitting the full statement so far as regards Institutional treatment for approval*I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,0. F. A. HOREAssistant Secretary.
Treatment,- Report or Schemes etc. submitted in weekended August 22nd 1017.1,    The general schemes for institutional treatment BUbm&amp;tted by the Joint Committee for Leinster and Connaaght has how beon sanctioned bux -ohe Committee have been asked to find further accommodation for convalescent cases. 2,    A deputation of the Willesden Local Committee was ^rooodyvod and the question of institutional treatment under the scheme proposed by them was discussed.    It was ascertained that one of the Auxiliary Hospitals in their area had demurred to the arrangements as to fees set out in Schedule I of the Instruction, on the ground that the services of tho doctors and staff being voluntary wert not covered by the fees fixed.    It was explained that the fees had been generally agreed on by the majority of such hospitals.    If, however, any hospital found it impassible to accept these fees they were entirely at liberty to do so, end that if a special case could be put up for a higher scale of fees this would be considered.    They promised to lay the matter before the Hospital Committee again.    A letter containing certain additional proposals for the treatment of discharged men was handed in by the Secretary of the Local Remittee and provisional sanction has been accorded to the majority ef the proposals formulated by the Committee as s temper cry measure to avoid delay pending the completion ot s comprehensive scheme for the whole arse of the Joint Committee.3.    The Kent Local Committee submitted a series of questions on.certain types of difficult cases of frequent occurrence which it was thought, were not e ntirely met by the Instruction! A memorandum as to the oases put and the views of the Ministry as to the proper mode of dealing with them has been circulated to all the Dirioional RoijreoonUatl^TOO of theLiniotry
Ministry inquiring whether i* their opinion the answers meet the difficulties and asking whether they have had experience of other problems of suf ficfe ntly frequent occurrence to justify the issue of general instructions, when their replies are received full instructions will be addressed to all Local Committees *

APPENDIX IX* &quot; &quot;i &apos; 1 * &apos;......&quot;*tj.....Memorandum of a Conference held on 20th August 1917 with Representatives of the Board of Agriculture on the subject of Training men in Agri-cultural pursuits generally including:General Farm V/orit. Poultry keeping. Soe Keeping. Dairy v/ork. Market Gardening. Fruit Growing. Forestry..-The whole question of training for the above named occupations tfas carefully considered in conjunction with representatives of the Board of Agriculture.    The opinion was that the prospects of employment after tho &apos;tfar would bo good in every branch, but in most branches the pay would be small, the worlr heavy, and probably unsuited for disabled men,    These remarks applied particularly to the work of a general farm labourer.    2ven In regard to motor tractor work-, which has been suggested as a very promising opening, groat dcubt was exprossed as to the number of openings and the suitability of the tfor): for disabled m*n.    The tractors at present in use are possibly of on unsuitablo type, and it may be that in the future a better type of machine and one more suited to the heavy plough-land which Is common in Sngland will be evolved, but c.t present, unless the existing organisation of County Agricultural Committees is !copt on foot, and they or some similar body supply the tractors, it appears un-likely that many. fnrmere will utilise them.It was pointed out that the training In Agri-cultural Colleges was not suitable for men who Intend todo
do ordinary agriculture work, and that ce.ro should be exercised in selecting the mon whom the hoc^X /c.mmine^*&apos;-send there as such training is only suited for men who ere going to be land agents or tr^jnanage- their own farms of considerable size.2,      Poultry Farming and Bee ileepinp;.It appears to be clear that it is useless to train men for these occupations unices they can be combined with other forms      work, or unless the men when trained will have capital of thoir own to enable them to start in business.3.      Dairy flork.It was stated that this is particularly mc^o work, and it would be woll worth while to train mon specially for it.    The training should include cow*keeping, general dairy work, calf rearing, etc - and three months&apos; training should suffice.    The wages would vary according to the district.    Before the ftar they averaged 25/* a week In Scotland, and 15/* a week in Norfolk, in each case with a house rent free.     It would be undosirable to employ tuberculous men in this work.4*     Market Gardening,U) Fruit Growing.There is an increasing demand for men in this occupation.    Disabled men could not do the heavy digging, but the large fruit growers employ a considerable staff of men as pruners, sprayers, pickers, packers, etc. All these are light jobs, end could be done by disabled men.    There was a great demand fer labour before the War, and this is likely to increase.     It will be best to concentrate the training in the orchards of the fruit -     growers at the main centres of the industry, which are &apos;-i5b0Gh&apos; -aidstone, Botley, Swanwlck and Zveshea.     Th* Board of Agriculture is establishing a farm colony inGlamorgan
Glamorgan where men may also he trained.    Tho training should last f*r cao year, out the growers would be willing to pay wagos during the greater part of this timo.(b) ftlaep-houso Work.There uto many Jobs which a disabled man could do in the employ of tho large growers ef vegetables such as Tomatoes and Cucumbers.    The main contros are in the Lea Valley, and in the Worthing area.    A man should be generally in good health as he has to go in and out of hot-housoBj but hardly any physical defect would bo a aerioU3 handicap to him..(c) Small Market Pardoning.There is a considerable demand for land for small market-gardens near many large towns, e.g. near Bournemouth.    If this were available (tho Board of Agriculture has, powers to assist in obtaining it) many men could be trained and could mako a good living, if they had a small amount ct capital.    It would, however,, be desirable that in every case men should commence work as wago camera, and only take small holdings after they have had some experience under a master. It is possible that the farm colonies which are now being established by the Board of Agriculture would be availablo for this worfc, but the mon would have to be selected by the Board, and at present the oponings would be very few, as thsao colonies aro ontiroly experimental and tho success of the experiment might bo jeopardij&amp;ed by the inclusion of an undue proportion of inexperienced men.There Is likely to be a groat increase of work after tho v?ar, and although^ttaoy could not do
such heavy work as tree cutting many openings will he available for disabled men, specially tuberculous men. It is possible that the Commlssloners cf woods and Forest3 might arrange a training cibursG at the College of Forestry In the Forest of Dean or elsewhere. Horticulture.It was considered that a limited numtfer of men might usefully be trained as gardeners in counties which are merely residential, e.g. Surrey, Berkshire and Hertfordshire.    They should have a yecrfs training, and this would best bo given by privato firms.. Generally, the conclusions&apos; arrived.at may be gummarized as follows:I. Training should be concentrated on preparingmen for employment with market gardeners, fruit growers,and growers of vegetables under glass. 2. Training should be given on the land and byprivate firms and net in Institutions of any kind. 3. The men shuuld be trained with the idea ofcommencing as employees and not as proprietors.Kr. Berry undertook to forward a list of tholarge organisations of fruit growers with whom it laproposed to communicate.
Training.,-&quot; Report on Schemes of Training submitted in week ended in August 22nd, 1917.1. Sanction has been given to a gch.ej.ie submittedby the Joint Advisory Committee for Lcinster and Connaught for Training disabled men as Waiters, Pantry-men and Carvers at the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin.     A course of 12 lessons is to be given by tho Head Waiter who is to receive a fee of l/- per man per lesson for a class not exceeding 6 in number, together with an additional l/- for each man on the completion of the course.    The Committee propose that this course should be followed by a further period of training in various Hotels in Dublin.     They have been requested to ma!:e definite arrangements v.ith the proprietors of the Hotels in ivhich this course is to be provided, as to the amount of wages to be paid to the men during training, and pending the receipt of further information on this point sanction has been withheld from this part o% the scheme.2. The Bradford Local Committee have submitteda scheme for training disabled men in various processes at the Technical School and School of Art. As the scheme does not provide for the utilisation of many of the facilities for training which the Joint Advisory Committee for Yorkshire have statod to be available In Bradford the Local Comnittee have been recommended to revise their proposals Tilth a vie;/ to securing both the fullest possible use of these facilitiesfor
for the whole of the Joint areas and also concentration on those subjects in which they can offer speciality efficient training.3, Sanction has now been given to the schemeof the Xsnt Hocal Committee for training men in Brushmaking at Messrs. Ccuchman^s wtrks.     The scheme, as amended, provides that Messrs. Couchm&amp;n &quot;undertake to pay the men at the end of the period of training, a sum not less than the rate of wages agreed upon between the Katie318-1 Society of Brushmakers and the British  rush ilanufacturers.1 Association or the currant rates of wages in the district&quot;.    The firm have also agreed topay the men a \7ar Bonus of 15^ in addition to the piece work rates.

APPENDIX   XIII. WAR PEtfSIOUS &amp;c, STATUTORY COMMITTEE.REPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTERFor week ended 22nd August, 1917.ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from Reports off, Inspectors, of Accounts.LANCASHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Fleetwooa Sub-Committee.$he Inspector examined all caso-^apera and states that though some of the early ones do not contain full particulars, the grants made appear to &quot;be in order.     The work generally is done satisfactorily.Kirkham Suh^CommitteetJour Sub-Committees have been appointed for eaoh district and their recommendations are submitted to the Central Committee. Supervision is good but the offioials are not yet fully acquainted with the working of the Regulations.Shaw and Crompton Sub-Committee.$he Seoretary is not fully conversant with the Regulations. Of oases examined the great majority are in order but two or three were found to be contrary to the Regulations and will cease.CARLISLE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The aooounts of this Looal Committee are not entirely satisfactory.     Effort has apparently been made to do the work very economically but efficiency has been saorificed in the endeavour.The Secretary of the Committee is not impressed with the worthiness-Cf such of his townsmen as have presented themselves before him for&apos;assistance, and in his opinion none of them are deserving of help beyond what they have already received.     This generalization is not veiy helpful to the carrying out of the provisions of the Regulations.BLACKPOOL LOCAL COMMITTEE.Disabled men are numerous, espeoially many of these without fixed homes, who often come to Blackpool on discharge.     Good atijention is being given to these oases and some men have already been sent for training under the Scheme of the Lancashire Joint Committee.The offioials are careful to follow the Regulations and are well hacked up by their oub-Committees.
MRRY LOCAL COMMITTED.The Inspector again visited this Committee on August 8th in order to test the inner working of the organization.     No oase records have yet been set up in connection with disabled men but arrears in this respeot will now be made good.The Inspector reports one case where the Committee, in spite of the Secretary1s ruling, decided the continuation of a payment. Cn reference to the Statutory Committee this was decided against them tut in spite of this, the Coaniittee decided on continuing the grant. The matter is being taken up by the Statutory Committee.     There is a possibility of this Committee getting out of hand and they have to be checked firmly.gSSEZ LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Secretaries of the Districts made it quite clear that they had neither the time nor inclination for routine work and complaints were constantly received regarding the Regulations and the continuous changes oonneoted with then.     There have been a considerably number of oases of infringement of the Regulations throughout this County, generally made throu h a lack of knowledge of the Regulations.Disabled sailors and soldiers do not appear to reoeive the attention they should.BIRMINGHAM LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Ministry are already acquainted with the decision of this Committee on the subject of Enquiry Offioers.     The Inspector thinks that in practice it will be found that the objections are unfounded. There are apparently two rival Societies of disabled discharged soldiers, eaoh claiming to be the original.     They are oausing the Local Committee no troubletand doubtless will be of assistance when they have adjusted their differences.The Committee expressed a hope that no considerable revision of the Statutory Committee Regulations Part II would be made by the new Special Grants Committee, as it would have a most upsetting effeot on the workers.     It is stated that the Regulations were now working satisfactorily but that some small revision might be advisable,-Regarding the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee, the Local Committee, in oommon with a good many other Local Committees is thoroughly dissatisfied with the work of the Civil Liabilities Committee.     No definite set of principles defining the manner in which grants are made appears to exist, and there is almost entire laqk of oo-ordination for which the Civil Liabilities Committee are responsible.     The Local Committee urged that the work should be transferred to it and state that&apos; there is no real investigation of statements made by applicants and that grants appear to be made or withheld capriciously.     The Inspector adds that fr^m considerable experience of the work of Civil Liabilities Committee, he concurs.The Local Committee are emphatic that the funotions of Medical Referees should not be executive, but purely advisory and that the responsibility for treatment should remain solely with the Local Committee.
gANSBA LOCAL COifclTTSS.There is.no doubt that money is being spent in Swansea with g lavish hand.     The fact that there iB no military hospital at Swansea is an excuse for granting assistance to men under Regulation LI fc) Part II of the Regulations, and if a man is in receipt of a small pension and cannot get light employment, the amount is made up. Only three or four men are being trained, the Committee are waiting for the combination scheme.    There is certainly evidence of sympathy with the disablement movement but this is revealed more in the manner in which they are spending money than by following the man up and shpwing control as well as sympathy.    There are signs of weakness in [this Committee in connection with Disabled Soldiers&apos; Assooiation.T&amp;traots from General Report3rof Inspectors on their Area. IgAST AND WEST RIDINGS 0? YORKSHIRE.The Inspector states he has now completed six months work in the above area and oan truthfully say that the Local committees are [whole-heartedly carrying out their work in the face of serious difficulties caused by the depletion of the Staffs.The fcest Riding Local Committee have established 480 Sub-CornmitteeSi, each Urban and Rural Council and seven Boroughs being represented.    About 60 of these Sub-Committees are making no payT* ments and 40 are paying out less than  1 a week.     In some of the smaller Looal Committees and especially the Sub-Committees of the West Riding, difficulty has been found in getting members to appreciate[the importance of observing the Regulations.     In a few instances,I Regulations have been deliberately ignored,T&apos;.e extension of Regulation 7 (1) (a) to dependants other than wives has given universal satisfaction among the Looal Committees.Reporting on disabled men, the Inspector.1 says that he can generally state that these oases get every attention.     There ia *. difficulty in persuading men to consider training, most particularly in the Colliery districts, but the class of men now being discharged is superior to the previous class and much more willing to consider both training and treatment.    The new Allowances to a wife while her husband is away under-going training or treatment are being greatly appreciated.The -ijooal Committees have been performing invaluable work and are getting every day to be more appreciated in their areas. Over 50fa of a Committee^ work consists in giving advice and corres-pon&amp;ing with Paymasters and helping generally, quite apart from dealing with applications for grants or other allowances.    All Committees are, however, agreed on one point, they will not refuse an application tor help made by a widow or dependant of a deceased soldier where Separation Allowance has ceased and pension is being drawn.
Reporting on the Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Essex, Leicestershire, Isle of Ely nd Rutland district the Inspector states the difficulties of the train service in covering this large area has made visits to Local Committees; exceedingly difficulty     He has found in practically every case and especially where good branches of the Soldiers1 and Sailors&apos; Families association and the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help,Society had been at work in the earlier days that the Regulations were being well carried \ put.     In two or three Local Committees there was rather a disorganised ondition at first but with growing experience the officials have improved both thomselveo and their work very considerably, and generally-speaking the work in this area is now reported to be on a fairly high   -.-level and is being carried out with enthusiasm.There has never been any complaint of neglect against any Committee or Sub-Committee, nor has the Inspector seen any adverse reference made to any of them in the local press.     On several occasions Labour Representatives havo told him that they are fcost pleased with the way in which the cases are considered by the respective Local Committees they happen to come before.PENSIONS BRANCH.Of the indivisual cases considered during the week there is none which calls for &quot;special oomoent.Amount advanced to Local Committees.

(Transfer of Powers) Act, 1917, which received the Royal Assent on the 21st instant.TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS OF STATUTORY COMMITTEE.v Section 1 of the Act directs that as from a date to be fixed by His Majesty by Order in. Council (referred to as the appointed day) the Statutory Committee shall be dissolved, and all their powers, duties and functions shall be transferred to the Minister of Pensions, except such as are by the Act transferred to the committee to be constituted under it, or as are conferred on the Statutory Committee by the provisions which it repeals. These provisions are mentioned in the Schedule to the Act, and for present purposes it is sufficient to specify&apos;&apos; paragraph (i) of sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, 1915, and sub-sections (3), (4), (5), and (7) of that section.The enactments relating to the powers, duties and functions of the Statutory Committee will apply accordingly. This is subject to certain modifications, and hence (1) references to separation allowances payable out of public funds are to be construed as references to separation allowances payable out of money voted by Parliament for navy and army services, and (2) references to funds at the disposal of the Statutory Committee are ,to be construed as references to moneys provided by Parliament for the purposes of the Ministry of Pensions.The functions of the Statutory Committee transferred to the committee to be constituted under the new Act are those specified in paragraphs (a), (h), (/), (g) and (h) of section 3 (1) of the Act of 1915. Moreover, any questions which may arise with respect to the amount of any grant or allowance to be made under paragraph (c), (d), (e) or (k) of section 3 (1) are to be determined by the committee.The property belonging to the Statutory Committee, except so far as it is derived from or represents money provided by Parliament, will be transferred to the R,oyal Patriotic Fund Corporation, to be applied by them for the purposes for which it was applicable by the Committee.APPOINTED DAY.The day appointed as the date as from which the Statutory Committee will be dissolved and as from which the provisions of the Act will take effect has been fixed for Saturday, the 1st of September next.CONTINUANCE OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS.The Act provides that nothing shall affect any schemes, regulations, orders or grants made by the Statutory Committee. Such schemes, regulations and orders will, until altered or revoked by the Minister of Pensions or by the Special &quot;Grants Committee, with the approval of the Minister, as the case may require, will continue in force. References in them to the Statutory Committee are to be construed as references to the Minister or to the Special Grants Committee accordingly, Section 5 (3).The system of monthly advances to Local Committees for the purpose of enabling them to make payments under Part II. of the Regulations of the Statutory Com-mittee will remain as at present, but all applications for such advances must on and after, the 1st September be made to the Minister of Pensions and ; the Quarterly Statements must be rendered to him. Under arrangements which have been effected with the approval of the Treasury, it will not be necessary for Local Committees to make up statements of receipts and expenditure to the appointed day, but all moneys advanced by the Statutory Committee must be accounted for(B1889) ; VVt.        - G536.

Ciroular No. 11.APPENDIX XVI.232MINI. SeoretarVs Office,    .     -:-: :r::X-..;]&apos; Westminster House, Millbank,^ &quot;-&quot;  &apos; .&apos; London, S;W; 1.,;-   / 20th August, 1917.JOINT COMMITTEES.Appointment of Representatives of the Ministry.I am directed by the Minister of Pensions to forward, for your . i, information, the accompanying List of the Joint Committees which have been formed under Section 2 (8) of the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c. Act, 1915, together with the names and addresses of the persons who hare been appointed to represent.the Ministry in the respective areas.. -. Although these representatives have been appointed in the first instance : in connection with the Joint Committees, Mr. Hodge takes the view that it is of the highest importance that they should be in close relations also with each Local Committee in their respective areas. It is hoped, therefore, that each Local Committee -will extend to the Representative of the Ministry for its area an invitation to attend the meetings of the Local Committee and of the Disablement Sub-Committee, and that facilities will also be given, for his attendance, when possible, at District and Sub-Committee Meetings. It will be understood that the Representative, will not be able to attend all such meetings, but Committees will no doubt bring to his special notice any at which important points.are likely to be discussed.
The Representative of the. Ministry will, as stated in this Office Circular No.- 2-of the 1.9th May.. 1917, be an Inspector in matters of Treatment and Training for the area of the Joint Committee to which he is appointed.- Apart from this he will carry out the duties of advice and assistance which have hitherto fallen to the General Inspectors&apos;of the Statutory Committee who have ceised to exist under that title. The duties of the Inspector of Accounts will remain as heretofore hut will be exercised over areas corresponding to those of Joint Committees, and in some instances will he carried out by the Representative of. the Ministrv.It is not intended that Local Committees or Joint Committees should be restricted in any way as to direct correspondence with The Ministry, hut it will be found in practice that there are many matters which can he&quot; more expeditiously settled by reference to the local Representative who has first-hand knowledge of local conditions and is at the same time in constant touch with the Ministrv.I am, Sir,Tour obedient Servant,The Secretary,::; ____Local War Pensions Committee,Secretary.3666 26956/G6l.^ 8,000  8/17  J.P.
