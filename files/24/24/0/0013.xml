DEPARTME1TCT Of-IIJFOmt&amp;TIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.ft]?SY//009.iEKLYREPORTSPAIN.    IX.August 21, 1917.The principal event that has occurred in Spain sincethe report of July 25 has been the attempt at a general strike, which was also, on the part of its leaders, an attempt at a revolution.     The Censorship Which was removed for a few days was revived on August 7th, and this prevents our knowing in any detail what has happened;   but the broad fact is certain that, even as a strike, and still more as an attempt to upset the Monarchy the movement has definitely failed.    *Some of the Socialist leaders of the revolution with at least one Deputy have been arrested;    the leader of the Reformist party, Senor Melquiades Alvares, who with his party lately united with the Republicans, is stated to be in hiding;   the large majority of the strikers made no attempt at violence and seem to have been rather lukewarm about the whole business;    the Catalan Senators and Deputies refused their support;   the Government showed firm-ness and decision and was strongly supported by practically the whole Press as well as by leading statesmen such as, among others, * the former Prime Minister, Count Romanones;   the Army gave no support to the Revolutionaries, but on the contrary obeyed its orders, both in suppressing disturbances and in keeping the rail-way service going.     The result must be a great disappointment to the Extremists and their sympathisers abroad who, like the Paris Rumanite, proclaimed that this time they were going to finish once for all with the existing system.     The measure of their failure is seen in the announcement today (21st) that the Govern-ment has felt strong enough to release the soldiers who had been called to the colours.
Yet, as has often been pointed out, the maintenance o:, order, if the most essential and elementary duty of Governments, is not the whole duty nor perhaps the most important.    The ancien regime in France maintained order pretty well, and so did Napoleon III.     But to do that is only to deal with the symptoms of the disease, not to touch its causes.     That is good so far as it goes because the symptoms of the revolutionary fever are very contagious if they appear in the open.     But if the disease itseli is not dealt with, it is sure sooner or later to break out into an open epidemic.The present epidemic has been got under.     But how long will it be before it breaks out again?    That is the really important question,     A country in which not in one town only but in many, the gravest disorders have occurred;   in which all but passenger traffic on the railways has been largely at a stand-still;   in which trains have been wrecked, and collisions between troopB and strikers have occurred, not apparently on a large scale indeed, but in many places and generally with some loss of life; in which a more or less openly Anarchist and Revolutionary move-ment is attempted in many towns, and has to be ,-iet by majbtial law; above all, in* a country in which discontent with the existing state of things is so acute and universal that it finds expression in the most moderate circles, cannot be said to be in a condition in which any observer can safely prophesy smooth things about it.&apos;..hy did this attempt fail?    On July 24th the ;,Times&quot; correspondent at Madrid, writing of the Barcelona meeting of Senators and deputies, seemed to regard it as a victor:- over the Government, and added:   ,,r.e appear now to be reaching a critical stage in this struggle-     T^e Government is losing rather than gaining ground....The leaders of the movement believe tftot benor Dato will resign, but ii their conviction proves to be erroneous and the Prime minister sticks to his post, then revolution will have the last word.      It will start by the proclamation of a
general strike&quot;.    Well, a month has passed, Senor Dato has notresigned;   the general strike has been declared: but the revo-lution haB not so far by any means had the last word.     On thecontrary in the &quot;Times&quot; of August 20th, the same correspondentwrites a long article on its failure, and gives the unexpectedone&quot;capacity and determination of the Government&quot; as aaas of the reasons why it failed.     The British Ambassador, who held that the Government was Morally victorious&apos; at Barcelona, and never believed in the success of a Revolution, has proved a truer prophet.The truth again seems to be that journalists who live in a capital among other journalists, whose very life is political excitement and agitation, almost always exaggerate the possibilities of revolution.     They tend in particular to forget thet loud talkers do not always show up well /hen it comes to action and that - particularly in a country like Spain, very backward and uneducated - they are very far from representing the masses of the people.In Spain the immense majority are totally ignorant of politics and totally indiffere.it to them;   so much so that they either refuse to vote at all (Spaniards say that in many elections no votes, or almost none, are actually oast:   the figures given being merely inserted by the Mayor I) , or vote as the local cacique or &quot;boss&quot; tells them, without any knowledge of parties or politics.     A writer in one oi the Conservative papers hsa even said in a. recent article demanding 1 drastic and radical1 reforms, making universal suffrage e reality instead of an [f    1 empty phrase*, that in the present state oi things, the G-overn-ment would always find itself returned by a large majority at a General election, even if it completely abstained from interfer-ing it the elections as it does at present.     bo greet, he thinks, is the ignorance and apathy oi the electorate -
-4-33This apathy has probably been one of the causes 0* the failure of the present movement.     But the most important causes are the loyalty oi the army and the -unwillingness of the politicians to yo to extremes at present.     The army got whet it wanted in its recent battle with the Government, and what it wanted was not Revolution.     The officers were ready to play with revolutionary programmes and vote for another King, or even a Republic, if they did not get their way in their professional objects.     But they did get it.     And having done so they re-turned to the anti-revolutionary position natural to their pro-fession, class and education.    The Jesuits do not educate revo-lutionaries.     And what is equally important, the men who are mainly illiterate peasants, have shown no disposition to disobey their officers.Probably the attitude of the Barcelona politicians was an even greater disappointment to the revolutionaries.     But they knew better than anybody the incapacity of most of the revo-lutionary leaders, and they knew better than foreign correspon-dents the probable strength and firmness of the Government. Moreover, about half of those who met at Barcelona were Conserva-tives, whose objects were Ro-ionalist, but the very opposite of revolutionary.     And the Regionalist policy has not been by any means absolutely repudiated by the existin ; powers.     In fact the Conservatives, as Senor Dato has lately remin&amp;d the Spanish public, have always shown themselves favourable to the reasonable demands of the Catalans.     The Regionalist party then, and the politicians generally, were not ready to despair of constitutional methods. And the defeat of the revolutionary strike may be taken as dis-posing for the time being of the &quot;maximalist&quot; or revolutionary policy which will now go into the background and will not come out again until the Minimalist policy, that is a peaceful and constitutional, but radical and serious reform of the. present system, has openly failed or been finally rejected by the King.
That is where the situation is at present.     It was reported,by the British Consul at Barcelona and other authorities that the Senators and Deputies who met at Barcelona intended to have another meeting on August 12th or 19th, probably at Vallado-lid, to formulate their demands for the revision of the Constitu-tion and present them to the King himself4 ignoring the Cabinet, and, in case of refusal, to follow their action up by stronger measures.    But nothing has so far been heard of such a meeting. It is very doubtful whether the Catalans really care about any Regionalmsm except their own and whether they do not demand some-thing like separation for themselves, which the other provinces of Spain would never concede.    Provincial feeling and differences have a life and reality in Spain which it is difficult for a Frenchman or even for an Englishman to understand.     If the world after the war, as some good judges think, is to find its best hope in the undoing of the centralisation of the last 200 years, and especially of the nineteenth century, it will find its task easier in Spain than elsewhere.     But Regionalism is one thing and Separa-tism another, and Regionalism is far easier tn the sphere of cul-ture than of politics.     Still it ought not to be impossible to take some steps in the direotion of self-government without arous-ing dangerous rivalries or impossible hopes.     But neither Region-alism nor any other reform will come to much unless the existing make-believe political system can be made a reality.     The events of the last few days have given Senor Dato a respite for a few weeks or pbrhaps months-     He does not appear to have any intention of dissolving immediately, and without a dissolution he would be dependent on the support of Count Romanones and his followers, which, Spaniards say, would be a position no Prime Minister could accept without a fatal loss of dignity.     But the dissolution cannot be postponed beyond a few months.     Will he attempt any real reform?    Apparently not.    For thoughAe declares that his
polioy is one of frankly democratic progress and that in this he has the active support of the Zing, yet he defends the exist-ing party system and is said to he &quot;preparing&quot; elections in the usual way by a wholesale appointment of new Mayors.    Can the leopard change his spots?   Can a Spanish politician who has long been in and out of office on the present rotativist system really make up his mind to do away with so convenient and profitable an arrangement?    And if he cannot, what will happen?It is hard for a foreigner to guess.    But the dis-satisfaction, even of those who are or have been themselves in the machine, seems so strong and universal that it is difficult to believe the system can maintain itself very much longer.     The British Ambassador thinks the best opinion of Spain desires to postpone constitutional questions till after the war.     On the other hand some Spaniards,who are strongly pro-Ally, urge that the present moment is the moment for action, and we know that, Senor Azoarrete, the veteran Reformist leader, told the King some weeks ago that if the need for action was not urgent, it was only because it was already too late.     The suggestion is made that British institutions have so much prestige in Spain generally and with the King in particular that the British Ambassador might well take the lead in urging His Majesty to adopt a real English Parliamentary system based on honest elections such as those held in England, where, to the utter amazement of Spaniards, the Government which dissolves is frequently defeated.     Ho such thing has ever happened in Spain.     If such a reform were carried out it is Baid that it would be greatly to the advantage of the Allies. For at present, however friendly Senor Dato, and still more Mar-quis LemS^ his Foreign Minister, may be, they have to work through a hierarchy of officials, civil and military, who. are mainly pro-Gterman:   and in the absence of the popular support which a free political system would produce, they are often unable to enforce
their policy if it is jmpalatable-^ Atthis moment, for instance, it is said that the s-J&amp;aarine decree is very imperfectly carried out.     Will the King, with or with-out British advice, try something of this kind?     If he goes on with the existing system, it is said that the falX of Senor Dato would probably mean that-Sener Besada, a pro-German of the pro-Germans, would become Prime Minister.     That would bo a disastar for Spain and an inconvenience, if   nothing worse, for ths Allies. The wiser policy would seem to be, even at this eleventh hour,, to attempt to form a National Cabinet and with that object to ap-proach the Reformists, who, more than any other party, represent the intellectual life of Spain, and ask them whether, in spite of Senor A2carrata!s word3, they will not even no-v rally at once to the Monarchy and help to reform instead of breaking up the ezist-ing institutions of their country.     It is hard to believe that they would refuse:   and hard to believe that such a move on the part of the King and its acceptance by them would not give the Monarchy the assurance of a new lease of stability.     The eoun-try would not think of Revolution till the new experiment had had a fair trial.This seems to outside observers the wisest course for the King and perhaps the last chance for the Monarchy.     But it would not be fair to him to pretend that it is precisely an easy course to adopt.    For it would certainly be very unpopular with the aristocratic, clerical and pro-German circles who are in olose touch with the Court:   it would be opposed by the majority of the official politicians:   and all kinds of education in the country, especially political, are so undeveloped that free institutions would certainly not be easy to work.     It is always true that the S-overrment of a country almost necessarily reflects the social and mor&amp;D. condition of the people:   and it is not a truth which can for many years be cf encouraging augury in Spain.    But there ara difficulties in all courses, as there
generally are in the treatment of disease:   and it looks as if things had got so far that if the iCing does not before very long apply his own suggical knife to the patient, other and more ruth-less hands will apply theirs-The only points to mention during this period in the direct relations between Great Britain and Spain are the appoint-ment of Spanish officers to serve on British Hospital Ships and the cordial reception given in the Spanish Press to Lord Robert Cecils declaration that Great Britain will never try to involve Spain in the war or urge her to deviate from the course she thinks most advantageous to her own interests.     The attitude of the French and English Press during the recent disturbances has also given great satisfaction, and is said to have prevented a fall in the present high prices of Spanish securities.Jj G.
