SCRET, I. 1874.WAH CABINET.Memo, by the Committee on the Production and Distribution of Milk.7The Committee, as a result of their enquiries, were able to (report to the Government in July that the information then available did not lead them to anticipate any serious national shortage of imilk next winter provided certain essential points received immediate attention.     They stated&quot;, however, at the same time, that local shortages were likely to occur.So far the Committee have discussed the &quot;shortage&quot; of milk in terms of scarcity amounting almost to a famine. They do not desire to convey the impression that enough milk iiorthat the total consumption doe:netneciato&quot;being takenbe considerablyincreased.     During the war it may not be possible to add con-siderably to the ccw popelation but the Committee believe that steps could be taken to reduce existing waste and actual total loss of milk and so, not only increase the quantity of the milk available for direct human consumption, but also perhaps help to steady the price.   Allowance now has tp be made by dealers in order to make good this loss..The attention of the Committee has repreatedly been drawn to the large amount of milk actually lost and wasted and to the preventable deterioration in the quality of much of the milk coming to large towns.     Before the war, this wastage and deterioration in quality was unsatisfactory,     It is now a natter cf urgent importance that it should be prevented.     The Committee are of opinion that this can be done.thaAt the end of the first Interim Report, the Committee stated t3 during the warmer months of the year, there was always aconsiderable l.-ss . of milk through souring;   that this was aggravated by the cur called railway services of the present summer; that less well-timed tram services, with longer exposure of full churns at stations, delay at transit and at the destination was certain to augment this loss.f./Accumulated evidence proved to the Committee that, not only did;this national loss and waste exist but that, owing to the war, it was of a more serious character than they had anticipated.The Committee have ^lso been astonished to find how much milk coming to London was pasteurised although sold to the public as fresh milk.     On investigation it was found that, in the majority of cases, the milk was pasteurised to prevent its souring and so aad a few hours to its life.     It was repeatedly stated that, unless the milk ware oasteurised as soon as it reached London in hot weather, it would -.sour before delivery to consumers.Milk which has so far altered as to be near the ?hich it sours can never, however treated, be of theand value as a food checked by chilling-been carried out atpoint at same qualityas milk in which bacterial growth has been soon after milking or where pasteurisation has an early stage in connection with this chilling.If
If pasteurisation is not required, in the interests of the consumer, it should not be adopted as it must add to the price of milk.     Hot only the actual   process costs money but it is-, estimated that something like 3 pints, per churn of 17 gallons (i.e* 2.46$) are lost through evaporation.Pasteurisation has In the past and is now,generally carried out, not in the interest ox the consumer but in that of the vendor.     If circumstances render this practice necessary then it should be carried out at centres near tHe source of production as a better and cheaper article would be produced.Practical experience of individuals and di co-operative societies which was laid before the Committee confirms the known fact that, if milk produced under conditions of ordinary cleanliness is chilled soon after it is drawn from the cow -pasteurisation is unnecessary.   Clean milk which has been properly chilled soon after bein^ taken from the cow, has been and is being sent from county depots in Scotland to London arriving actually in a better condition than some of the milk drawn from English counties not far from London which has never been brought to a lower temperature than the water on the farm, i,e, seldom below 650 in summer and is frequently higher.The Committee feel confident in stating that the present loss of milk through souring and the condition of the milk which, though not actually sour, has yet lost its freshness is unnecessary and preventable and that milk of a better quality could be provided were it cleaned and chilled soon after miling and before being put on rail.     They believe that the cost of so chilling milk at depots in the country is cheaper than tho present system of pasteurising it in towns.Other advantages would arise if a proper system whereby suitable centres for the collection, treatment and distribution of milk were established in the country cheese-makingplant attached, withV .;.?r lot ion-between-producer and retailer as Well as between oonsumer and trader (whether producer or retailer) would be sensibly diminished if a better article, less lieble to souring were sold.The quantity of liquid milk sent to towns could be regulated to meet the daily neeis of consumers.   This would avoid the extravagance of sending- by rail milk which is not wanted and Which deteriorates as raw materiel for cheese-making-.   Cases in London have been ^uoted to the Committee of surplus milk which had gone sour being poured down the drains.   Such a waste could hardly occur if the supplies coming to London were better regulated. k further waste occurs when milk is converted into cheese in towns, the whey being- generally unused whereas, in country districts, it oan be fed to pigs.Better  ours could be obtained for bilkers.     The public have long been aware of the objeotion felt .by milkers to the early hours wt which their operations start.     This is usually necessary in order to get the milk despatched to large towns for consumption the same day, experience having shown that milk deteriorates very rapidly in quality under existing conditions. If the milk were collected and chilled within a reasonable time, the need for this early delivery to the consumers would no longer exist.The
E4th August 1917,(Signed)   Waldorf Astor.Chairman.The Committee feel justified in recommending, on the points named,- that suitable centres. shcuXO. &quot;be established (1) where milk could &quot;be collected, chilled and despatched in such quantities as may be required to meet the needs of consumers and (2) where surplus milk can be made into oheese. etc.     The Committee are convinced thai private effort alone will not enable anything even approaching the minimum number of depots required to be established in time to relieve the situation next winter or even next summer.    They do not advocate the establishment and ma intenance of these Centres by a department, nor do they think it would be wise or in the best interests of the farming community to give money to individuals or bodies of individuals.   The Committee think thati at this stage, the best results would be obtained if grants were made to the Agricultural Organisation Societies ,of England, Scotland and Ireland to enable them to undertake a campaign for the formation, in suitable areas, of dairy farmers1 co-operative societies and, if the State were, by means of short-term loans, repayable say in five years, to enable such socle Ities to establish centres or depots of the kind referred to in this report.&apos;      The Committee recommend that thi3 course should be followed.The Committee realise that, during the war, depots could, only be established where existing buildings could be adapted readily and without much cost,      They do not recommend or believe it possible, this year or even next year, to get anything like the requisite number of depots established out they feel convinced that,- in certain districts, there is an urgent need for the creation of such centres to deal with the milk locally produced; that the amount of money required would not be large; that money so spent would be well spent and would begin to repay the outlay, immediately by presenting existing losses and wastage of milk and cheese.Briefly, the depots should only be started in districts which are served by an adequate system of roads.   They should be situated near a railway; a brine cooling plant should be provided and, although the Committee do not consider that a pasteurising plant should be necessary, they do not object to it.   The capital cost of a depot which deal3 with l,CO0 to 2,000 gallons of milk per day should range from  1 to  3 per gallon, according to the amount of construction necessary.
