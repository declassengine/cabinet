-  .C(jDepartment of InformationIntelligence BureauSpecial MemorandumonTHE GERMAN MINORITY OR INDEPENDENT SOCIALISTSAugust 22nd 1917. Attached is a memorandum concerning the position of the Gorman MinorityJor, as they ere now called - the Independent) Socialists.Their position is of importance (1) in any attempt to sum up the political feeling in Germany, (2) in regard to the Stockholm Confer-enne.&quot;Te are fortunate in having very reliable first-hand information with regard to the views of thoir leaders, for they talked freely while they were at Stockholm.     It is unnecessary to point out that what thoy said in private conversation there should not be used publicly, for ta do so might have very serious consequences for them.It is quito olear that on all the essential points at issue between us and the German Government, they are on our side.1.    They have always insisted that the whole question of the origin and responsibility of the war is quite essential.     It ia on this point especially that they have joined issue with the Majority Socialists.     The German Government are now rumoured to have declared that they will not allow any Germans to attend tho Stockholm Conference at which the origins of tho war are tc be discussed.     The evidonoe for this is still defective, but it is obvious that such a step on the part of the German Government is one which, in certain circumstances, might have been used very greatly for our advantage.     Academically speaking, we oould have no situation more favourable than that the Allies were prepared to allow their representatives to attend the Conferenoe, but that the whole thing broke down because the German Government would
(not consent to a discussion on the responsibility for the war. This discussion indeed should be made a sine qua non condition in any Con-ferenco in which Gorman Socialists of both parties are represented.-On this point we could depend upon the Independent Socialists. They know the whole question bettor than anyone else, and we could hope for nothing better than to see them argue it in public with tho Majority Socialists.(8)   Peace Terms:       On the crucial points at issue between us and Germany., they are quite sound.     While the Majority Socialists are prepared to support the conception of peace without annexations in the sense given to it by the German Government, the Minority Socialists say that a mere return to the status quo would leave things in the futore no better than they were in the pa-st.     They strongly reprobate the whole troatment of Belgium by Gormrny end would support not merely the complete restoration of Belgium, but also indemnities to Belgium by Germany.     In this connection there may be quoted what was said by a German when he was discussing this very matter:    &quot;Do not deprive us of the only method we have for doing something to repair the wrongs wo have committed.&quot;    This of course is only one individual, but it is a point of view which should be encouraged, and wiij, he en-couraged by the Minority Socialists.With regard to Alsaoe Lorraine, they are quite definitely m favour of settling the matter by an appeal to the population.     They have not said much about Austria, and of course the Socialists as a rule are opposed in Austria to the appeal to Nationalism, for this distracts attention from the &quot;Class War&quot; that they want always to keep in the foreground.What is most important i3 that they really desire the victory of the Allies, for they see that it is the only way of breaking down the foroes of militarism and reaction at homo.    This has been avowed
in so many-words in private conversation;   but of course we can-not publicly use this knowledge, but it is important to keep it in mind.As to their position in Germany, we cannot of oourse speak with certainty, but all indications are ^o the effeot that if there were the opportunity for a real trial of strength, such as would be givsn by a general election, they would gain greatly in strength;   the Majority Socialists would more and more be driven towards tho Right, and to association with the Government, and would completely lose the influence which they have had ao as Independent Party.     Put into so many words, Schcidemann and his friends have no future;   they would become absorbed in the Liberals and thereby would lose their influence over &quot;the working man.It is of course most desirable to avoid any open referenoe to them.    We know how foolish the German Government becomes when it turns for support to English Pacifists.     On the other hand there iB a roal difference betwoon tho English Pacifists and the German Minority Socialists.    Pir3t of all there can be no doubt that in Germany this party has a very much larger following than the Pacifists in England.     Secondly, their loaders are much more at,, home in the discussion of international affairs than are the leaders of the English Independent Labour Party.     It has boon part of their work for years past;   they understand the naturo of the German Government, for they have always been fighting, it, and it is not mere prejudice if we Bay that they know what they are ta* talking about.J.W.H.
m    4    mThe German Minority or Independent Socialists. (1)    Their Leaders.The Minority Socialists in Germany are an organised political(a)group. They stand at present on the extreme left, and their views on the war are largely identical with those of the Allies [this is literally true, and we have first-hand evidence vfor it).Their leading men are Haase (the Party chief), Bernstein, Kant sky, Cohn, and Ledebour.    The Majority Socialists have pointed out, a3 a taunt, that while almost all the Majority delegates to the preliminary conferences at Stockholm wore &apos;,proletarians,,, the Minority delegates were almost all &quot;intellectuals&quot;.      This is a more or less true, and probably significant, analysis of the lines on which the original Social Democratic Party has divided since the(b)War.    But though the Minority leaders are preeminently intellectuals, they are by no means out of touch with the people. (2)    Their Views,!-The main outlines of the Minority caso are clear.    They are expressed in speeches (especially the exhaustive speech by Haase a year ago) and confirmed by conversations at Stockholm in June, 1917.     Their published Stockholm programme (see Appendix) is by no means complete (if it had been, their activities in Germany would have been cut short altogether by the Government) - but even so it is a startling document, and the German Censorship is charged with having forbidden its publication.(a)    There are individuals in still more extreme opposition: Lieb-knecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Franz Mehring (who wrote to the Russian socialist Tcheidze, when the Stockholm conference was first suggested, warning him not to meet Scheidemann).    But the first two of xheso are in prison, and none of them have any organised fshowing.    Moreover, the leftward trend is so steady that Haase pr,babty stands nov whors Liobknccht stood a year ago.(bj    Bernstein and Cohn are also Jews.(c)    This was stated in a question asked in the Reichstag on July 20th.     In answer the Chancellor&apos;s representative disclaimed knowledge and stated that inquiries were already being made. We have no evidence as to wheihur the prohibition has since been v/ithdrawn.
(a)   In a speech trade a year ago at a (very stormy) conference of the wboio Social Democratic Party.(a)   On the Responsibility for the War.This is the foundation of their case, as it is of our own. On August 4th, 1914, they voted the ?/ar credits with the rest of-the Social Democratic Party, because they were ta&amp;en by sur-prise and had not convinced themselves of the German Government&apos;s guilt.    By the Autumn of 1914 they had reached this conviction, ... and they then denounced the party truce and went into active opposition.    This is how their breach with the Majority arose. The Majority charge them with a breach of party discipline, but they charge the Majority with the betrayal of Social Democratic principles.     The Majority, they Say, &quot;have emmeshed themselves in the ideology of the Bourgeois parties&quot;, and that is why German Social Democracy has lost its influence over the course of events.In the controversy concerning the origins of the War theMinority are strong.    They have found all the joints in the GermanGovernment!s armour:- &quot;That unheard-of ultimatum to Serbia&quot;; theomission to publish the correspondence between the German andAustro-Hungarian Governments; the omission of a certain telegramfrom the Tsar to the Kaiser in the first German White Book; theprematuro announcement of German mobilisation in tho Bokal Anzeiger,(a)in &quot;that ominous special edition&quot;.     Haase roundly   asserts that this was a manoeuvre by Moltkc, Tirpitz and Ealkenhayn behind the backs of the Kaiser and Bothmann-Kollwcg. (h)   On the &quot;Defensive&quot; Waj3*Haase exposes the various justifications for supporting the War: e.g. , that &quot;England is to blame&quot;; &quot;a war against Tsarism&quot;, and so on.    The German Staffs answer to the menace of Russian mobilisation was - the invasion of Belgium.&apos;     The Battle of Tannen-berg showed that the Russians were not fully mobilised for weeks after the German ultimatum was sent.     The documents seized in

Belgium do not prove v/hat the Government represents.     &quot;Holding out till viotory&quot; implies, not defence, but the overthrow of the enemy.    The sentimental appeal to &quot;support our sons at the front&quot; is no proper argument against political aotion.On the broader plane, he quotes pre-war speeches of Scheidemann to prove that in the race of armaments Germany set the pace both to England and Prance.     &quot;There is no possible doubt about the character of thiB war.     As early as July 25th, 1914, our Party Executive described it precisely: the great power policy of Austria and the imperialist interests of profiteers.    We must add Germany^ endeavour to secure a through connexion from Heligoland to Bagdad by way of AUBtria-Hungary and the Balkans.&quot;(c)   On the P^y, Sg&amp;jjjjgggnt-The Minority Socialists have always exposed the ^insincerity of German &quot;Peace Talk&quot;, and they charge the Government, as well as the Pan-Germans, with never having renounced Annexation.   Germany&apos; official conduct towards Belgium is the chief field of their attaoks.In contrast to the Majority leaders, who are always proclaiming themselves &quot;German (i.e. patriotic) Social Democrats&quot;, the Minority call the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in lb71 &quot;robbery&quot;, an^ propose terms to the Central inspires1 disadvantage in their Stockholm pro-gramme (see Appendix)   which go far beyond the Statuo quo.    There is evidence that their views have become more uncompromising during the past year (especially on the question of a plebiscite for Alsace-Lorraine).     At Stockholm in July last they identified themselveo unreservedly with the formula of the Petrograd Soviet: &quot;2jTo anncxa-tione or indemnities, and self-determination of populations.&quot; Naturally they differ amon/s themselves as to the application of this principle (for instance, as regards the Break-up of Austria-Hungary). But the most important fact that came out during their stay at Stockholm is that they do finit ely de s ire Germany t o suffer^a, military defeat.     There are three first-rate pieces of evidence for
this; but they cannot of course state it publicly, ant), it coulu notbe used by us without ruining them politically, to the detriment ofourselves.(3)    Their Strength.Up to July 31st 1917, they claim to have captured 62 out of 350 Social-Democratic electoral districtsorganisations in Germany, and to have set up rival organisations successfully in^constituen-cies where the original organisation still remained in tho Majority^ hands.    They have also b&apos;een*very near capturing at least one first-class trades union, and they have been tho power behind the peace-strikes.    The Government does everything it can to repress them, and a year ago Haase was accusing the Majority Socialists of assist-ing   the Government in this in underhand ways.     In spite of this, Bernstein stated his belief, at Stockholm last July, that the Minority had really won over a majority of German organised labour, and a general election would certainly increase their representation in the Reichstag at the Majority&apos;s expense. (4)    Their Prospects.Will the Minority continue to gain ground at the Majority&apos;s expense?    And will this go on till the German working people find themselves converted, as a class, to the Minority point of view? If this happened, the Minority $arty would become a political factor of first class importance   (which they oxe clearly not as yet), but there are three ma,in factors working against thorn:-(a)   Tho Military Success of Germany.     Tho continued occupa-tion of vast conquered territories makes the idea of giving up even more than the Status Quo seem preposterous to German public opinion. Confidence in the submarine campaign is also a powerful antidote to Minority Propaganda amongst people ( and these are naturally the great majority) who do not look at the war from a moral point of view, but who would all the same be ready to consider a Minority settlement for the sake of immediate peace., if they were once
convinced tiaat victory was impossible.(b) The Majority Peace-Movement.     The strong point about the Majority peace-programme is that it is patriotic.     It becomes still stronger if the./ can show that it has any political effect in the direction of ending the war; and from this point of view the peace-resolution of the Reichstag, for which the Majority Socialists claim credit, has almost certainly increased their prestige.     Coinciding, roughly, with the Russian military break-down, this must for tho moment have checked the Minority!s pro-grcss to a considerable degree.(c) But the most seriouo handicap to the Minority is the official persecution, which makes it impossible for them to fight tho Majority in Germany on equal terms.    Their case is unanswerable, and they are extremely able advocates of it, but thpy have neveryet had a fair field.     Por this reason they are more eagera than any bnei else for the general conference at Stockholm.     The French Socialist Party has insisted that the question of responsibility for the war shall be placed on the agenda.     we have confidential information that Branting and the German Minority &quot;arc determined to make the debate on tftie point a &amp;ekftfce for the German Majority&quot;. And now Michaelis is reported to have stated that, if the question of responsibility is to be raised, no German delegates will be allowed to take part.Under Brantingfs guidance, the Stockholm project has therefore taken a turn that is extremely awkward for Germany.     If the con-ference takes place, the Gorman Government must either issue pass-ports or refuse them.     If it refuses, it will&apos; have confessed that it cannot face an open discussion of the responsibility for the war. If it issues them, it will merely be sending its Majority Socialists to destruction.     Por the German case in their hands will be demolished, not by the Socialists of the Entente, but by the
m    9    -delegates of the German Minority.&apos;       It may therefore be pre-eumed that both the German Government and the German Majority Socialists are now secretly anxious to avoi^ the Conference, if only they can do eo without taking the onus of the step upon themselves.A.J.T.22/8/17.(a)   There are grounds for statins that Brantin.&apos;i will not admitGerman Majority delegates unless the Minority are given pass-ports too.
APPENDIXProgramme of the German Minority Delegates, published at Stookholm on July 8th. 1917(a) Immediate peace,(b) Disarmament;   freedom of trade and navigation;   oempulsory arbitration;   international sotial legislation.(o)   Enfranchisement of women.(d)   Equal rights to all inhabitants of a country irrespective of race, language, religion.(o)   &quot;National and social liberation cannot bo achieved by the governments at war;   it can only be done by demooracy&quot;.(f) Democratio control of foreign polioy.(g) Geographical status quo not sacred, but war must not be pto-longed to alter it.&quot;Regulation of frontiors must be conditional upon the assent of the populations oonoerned and not an act of force. From the beginning of the war we have consistently demanded peace without annexations or indemnities, based upon nation-al self*-government&quot;.(h) /Serbian independence must be restored.     Union of all Serbsin national state and fibpublican Balkan Federation also ,   desirable.(i) Prussian and Austrian Poland have the same right as Russian Poland to national independence.(j)   Prolongation of war cannot settle Alsaoe-Lorraine.     In 1871 it was annexed to Germany against the will of the population. k plebiscite Is the only solution.     fflhichevor way the vote turned,it would bring Germany a balance of gain - oconomic, poTTSToal and moral.(k)   Political and economic independence of Belgium, according to Bethman Hollweg&apos;3 promise, is essential.     Reparation for damage done is entirely distinct from a war indemnity.(1)   Condemnation of colonial conquest.     Possession of non-self-, governing colonies equivalent to slave-owning.     Colonies not necessary for industrial development.(m) The International must be made strong, and national sootions must be prepared to fight their governments on behalf of the International Socialist Peace Programme.
