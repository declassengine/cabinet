From:^^&quot;\ General Barter, Russia. To:- C.I.G.S.     War Office.RET27th August- 1917; 1 p. m.No. 102 M.To-day I had cordial reception from Kerenski.I communicated to him the assurance of our continued energetic action cn western front with a view to relieving pressure onsuccess of vigorous measures for restoration of discipline.     He asked me in reply to convey his cordial appreciation and to assure you that his Government would never consent to separate peace or to terms dishonouring to Russia or Allies.     He complained that the TMilitary party is urging the adaption of measures which, if applied precipitately, would only lead to mutiny and to disorder and general acts of violence. He produced telegrams to showthat already some commanders at the front are abusing their new powers by cruel use cf lash. He considered that the (one groupundecipherable) of soldiers committees and commissaries at the present moment would lead inevitably to disastrous result. I agreed with this latter opinion. I asked him if he thoughtthat the troops would remain in the trenches when winter arrived. He.replied that he is confident that they would do so.   I hinted that time is short, and that if the authority of the officers was not reestablished by then the men would probably refuse to remain in&apos;the trenches.       He replied that he is confident that in the coming 3 months discipline v/ould be restored sufficiently to avert this calamity.       He anticipate (sic) any German danger through Finland before next spring, by which time our authority and influence would be restored.        As regards his general policyRussian front.I assured-him also of your best wishes for thehe
he remarked somewhat slyly that the dissatisfaction of both tho right and the (one group undecipherable) was the best proof that the middle courso which he is following is a sound one.   My general impression was that Kerenski was honest in his views, but that he is too absorbed with the maintenance of the revolution, and that he puts this consideration before the safety of Russia.     I find that many of Kerenski1s bitterest opponents also consider him honest in intention, but all agree that he is expecting too much merely from words, from his own personal influence amongst troops, and that both the anarchy in the Interior and the demoralization at the front demand the immediate and stern application of force.    They are undoubtedly right in this view.     I also had long interview with Aiexieff, whose views are always moderate and sound, and of whose unselfish patriotism there can be no doubt: he is emphatic regarding the vital necessity for immediate and drastic measures.     He also does not think question to be dis-quieting at present.    I  shall send his remarks regarding Finland by letter.     Alexeieff is very apprehensive of German advance on Odessa and Nikolsieff, the possessi3n of which would paralyse Black Sea fleet.     He thinks the fall of Riga very probable but regrettable rather for its moral . than strategical reasons.     He does net think Germans would advance in any case beyond&apos;Riga before next spring.    I shall see Korniloff to-morrcw.     Conference did not assemble to-day.     I understand Kerenski is endeavouring to muzzle all opponents, but the members of the Duma are fighting hard for the right of speech; as vice President informed me to-day with much bitterness.     Am keeping on friendly terms with all parties alike.
