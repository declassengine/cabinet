CONFIDENTIAL[49/4700.WAR CABINET. Supply of Winter Clothing to the Russian Army, Note by the Secretary of State for War,.  With reference te War Cabinet 204r minute 5, the attached statement shows the stocks of winter clothing held by the War Department on 11th August 1916 and 51st July 1917.     The figures at first sight would appear to give cause for alarm, but this is not so in reality inasmuch as the stocks held on 11th August 1916 contained to a considerable extent the[necessary supplies for the winter of 1916 - 1917 while the stocks held on 31st July 1917 contain less of the supplies for the coming winter, because contracts are now on a weekly delivery basis and supplies are coming in in steady instalments all the time instead of there being a large delivery and then a stoppage as was the case last year *Our own wool consumption has been reduced to the utmost in order, to save freight and to help to meet the labour difficulties arising out of the restriction of wool for civilian purposes.     In the circumstances I am afraid that the stocks do no admit of any article being diverted to the assistance of the Russians,In addition enquiries have been made privately from Sir Alexander HcRobert, who owns the Cawnpore, Dhariwal and Bangalore Mills, aa to whether India could assist to a greater extent if Australian wool was diverted there.     He states that his mills are now practically controlled establishments in India, and are now producing three times the normal output.     He also.....,says that he could still cope with increased demands if theMinistry of munitions would help to get them additional hosiery machines, a large quantity of. which have been ordered.They are already taking cJ70,000 worth of Australian wool, and the existing plants are not capable of woarking up any further considerable quantity from Australia.     Ke does not hold out any hope, till he gets more machinery, of increasing the output in India; and it is understood that tfce mills in. ^ustra^lia and New Zealand are already working to their full eapacity in equipping their ov/n Contingents.DERBY.28th August, 1917.
