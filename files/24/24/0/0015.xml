Q.A.D. 602/l.General Headquarters,British Armies in the Field, 21st August, 1917.The Chief of theImperial General Staff.I beg to forward herewith, for the information of the War Cabinet, a report oh the operations in Flanders from the 4th to the 20th August, 1917, with, a statement of my views on the present situation.(Signed) .     D. HAIG.Field-Marshal. Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France.
SECRET, o O.A.P. 602VReport on the operations in Flanders from 4th August, to 20th August.. 193 7.For several days after the d&amp;tsof my last report to the War Cabinet (KO.0.A.D. 589 of the 4th August, 1917) the weather continued so unfavourable that a renewal of the advance in Flanders was impossible.   The troops suffered very great hardship and their maintenance in the positions won entailed most exhausting labour.   They rose superior to every trial, however, and,  as the weather slowly improved preparations for a further advance were pushed on, entailing some local fighting to secure passages across the STEEKBEEK and to gain sufficient room beyond it for the deployment of the infantry before the next assault.The unavoidable delay in preparing for this assault enabled the enemy to bring up considerable reinforcements* and it was evident that our next advance would be strongly contested and that heavy counter-attacks, delivered by the divisions he had brought up into reserve, were to be reckoned on.   in addition to this the weather conditions rendered counter-battery work and flying so difficult that our artillery superiority was to a great extent neutralised. In view of these various considerations and of the state of the ground it was determined to limit our next advance to much less than we could have hoped to effect under more favourable conditions.The advance was eventually fixed foi? the 16th August, the earliest date on which the ground was likely to be passable.   It would have been preferable to have waited longer to enable the enemy 1 s guns to be more definitely overcome,  as well as to give the ground more time to dry; but weather prospects were still doubtful , the Army Commander had already been obliged to relieve the whole of the infantry once owing to the exhausting conditions they had to contend with, and for the same reasons the troops who had carried out this relief would not be in a fit state to attack if the assault was longer delayed.   Another relief would have become necessary and this would have entailed several days&apos; delay. Moreover, the troops already relieved required a longer rest before again being t hvuwn into the fight / and the number of divisions available for carrying on the battle is, of course, limited.On the 15th August an attack by two Canadian divisions^ for which preparations had been in hand for some time, was launched in the neighbourhood of LENS.
As already reported, it was completely successful, and no leBa than four German divisions suffered so severely in trying to hold the position, and in the numerous counter-attacks launched in the hope of regaining it, that they may he regarded as unfit for further serious efforts for several weeks at least.     This successful operation will also serve to prevent the enemy from weakening his line on the First Army front in order to reinforce his defence in Flanders.Next day (l6th August) a general advance was made &quot;by the Fifth Army, in which the French First Army co-operated on the left flank.     A few days of fairly fine weather had dried the ground a good deal, hat a heavy rainstorm on the previous evening had again rendered it very difficult and the advance was made under more unfavourable conditions than had been hoped for.     In many places the men could nnly get forward by assisting each other out of the breast-high mud and water in the shell holes.Despite all difficulties and disadvantages, however, the whole of our objectives, including the village of LAlfGEMARCK, were gained and maintained from a point oirer 2,000 yards east of that Tillage to the French left.Further south the advance also went well at the outset,but in various places, exhausted by their efforts and with their rifles often so clogged   by mud as to be temporarily useless, the troops in some casefower^e held up by strong points and in others were unab3e to maintain the foremost positions gained.     The gain of grume was therefore comparatively small, but the more important object of forcing the enemy to expose himself, and causing him heavy loss, was fully attained, and at a modei&amp;te cost to our troops.The strongest opposition of all was experienced on the main ridge oy the fight corps of the Fifth Army.     Appreciat-ing the tactical value of this ground, the enemy has concentrated his efforts Jin retaining it, and every foot of our advance there is bitterly contes-ced and will doubtless continue to be so U3itil the enemy&apos;s power of resistance is beaten down.Reviewing the results of the operations up to and including this battle - of the l6th August I am well satisfied with them, although the gain of ground would certainly have been much&apos; more considerable but for the adverse weather cord?    one *      Even as matters are&apos;, however, we have gained 2j000 yards along the crest of the main ridge and rather more than that on the northern slopes immediately overlooked from it.t A^xn,,&quot;!^ih?r north the area gained grows deeper until round LANGEMARCK it reaches about .6,000 yards from our starting lineof
of the 31st July.   Our line :is \then /gradually drawn in, form-ink a strong defensive flank along the STSENB3 ElKt to the French left which rests securely on the Inundations about VmX&amp;A further advance of 3,500 yards by the right corps of the Fifth Army will give us possession of the summit of all the &quot;most important part of the main ridge, from STIRLING CASTLE by 1-/00RDEMH0EK to BROODSEINDE, and when that has been gained, evento should move much faster (given reasonable weather) as we shall not only have gained valuable advantages of position but, in gaining it\ we,shall certainly have gone a long way to breaking down-the enemy&apos;s power of resistance.   He has no option but to resist our advance oh this high ground to the full extent of his power, and it is tactically very strong and favourable to the defence.   If he fails to hold it he cannot hope to stay our further advance or even to delay it to any-thing like an equal degree..Apart from this question of gain of ground the results already accomplished are very considerable. On the FLANDliRS and LEMS fronts the enemy has already been compelled to with-draw no less than 24 divisions, and those now in line must be suffering severe daily casualties under our heavy shelling, which, in the fine weather we are now having, can be given its fullest effect.The enemy&apos;s casualties in FLANDERS and at LENS since the 31st July inclusive are estimated at, approximately, 100,000 men; and no doubt he has suffered further heavy-casualties, and has had more divisions put out of action, in the successful French attack at VERDUN yesterday.Conclusive evidence is now available that all, or practically all, his 1918 class are in the ranks and have already suffered oevere casualties.   It has also been fully established that the fighting value of these boys is low.The 1919 class has already begun to make it3 appearance in the front line and its fighting value may con* fidently be expected to prove even lower than that of the 1918 class..The 1920 class cannot be available for many months yet, and therefore we are justified in expecting that not only will there be a further marked, and increasing, deterioration in the enemy&apos;s fighting qualities., but the time is fast approaeh-ing when he will be unable to maintain hie armies at their present numerical strength.Some of his unite are still fighting almost as well as ever, especially in defence; but the signs of deterioration in others are   well marked, and it is notewarthy that even on our present limited front of attack he has failed to pro-videptauneh troops on a considerable part of his line.   In front of the XIV Corps a large portion of the defending troops are reported, both by our own men and by prisoners, to have run away.   Such weak portions of a position must re* suit eventually in compromising the whole of it; and even though, for a time, the rents made may be filled up by throwing in other troops, this entailB a very heavy drain, as well as discontent and loss of moral amongst the troops so thrown in owing to the unsrustworthiness of their comrades.
For *11 these   reasons, although the struggle le likely to continue severe for some wseks yet, there is good ) reason to hope that very considerable results will, than follow, and with more   rapidity than may seem likely at present.If we are favoured &quot;by a fine autumn, therefore, I regard the prospects of clearing the coast &quot;before winter sets in as still very hopeful, notwithstanding the loss of time caused by the bad   wealtheiduring the first half of August. At the least, I see   no reason to doubt that we shall be able to gain positions from which subsequent operations to clear the coast will present a far easier problem than we ^ad to cope with at the cutset of this offensive, and in which the losses and hardships suffered round YPBES in pre-vious winters will be much reducedeIn these circumstances, the right course to pursue, in ny opinion, is undoubtedly to continue to press the enemy, in Flanders without intermlcpion and to the full extent of our power; and, if complete success is not gained before winter sets in, to renew the attack at the earliest possible moment next year.Success in clearing the coast may confidently be expected to have such strategical and political effects that they are likely  to prove decisive.   It will simplify immensely our naval problem.   It will go a very long way to-wards rendering air raids against England, impossible.   It. will render the enemy&apos;s positions in Northern France so. pre-carious and so dangerous that it is almost a certainty, he-will retire from them.   And it will prove to Germany and to GermanyVe allies that the German armies are no longer able to save them from complete disaster.(signed)   D. HAIG...Field-Marshal.21st August, 1917.
