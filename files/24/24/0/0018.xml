W A, R     C a B I Mthe STEEL SITUATION IK AMERICA.Copy of letter;from the President of the Lackawanna Steel Company to Lieut. Cfolonel Herman Clarke,, Inland Ifeter Transpor*tr^ep.artment&quot;&quot;%/ar QfficeTLACKAMM STEEL COMPAKY, Office of the President, 2 Sector Street nev; YORK. .  3rd July, 1917.Dear Herman,Your letter oi July 11th in regard to the operation of car ferries across the English Channel arrived this morning, shd I have sent a letter; to my friend, - Albert *J, Goodrich, of Chicago, who la President of the.&apos;Goodrioh Transportation Co. and have asked him to look up the: question of the men that you want and to take it up; direct with Major Owen of Montreal;   and have also written to Major,Owen, and feel sure that the problem will be worked out. .-..,  will, advise you the outoome as soon as I have anything definite.I havo not heard from you for a long time and realise that it is a good while since I have written you.Things move along here in a way that is very unsatis-faetory.   You have probably seen something in the papers of the row between Gen. Goethals and Mr, Denman, Chairman of the Shipoing Board, &apos;About two months ago when the Senate passed a Bill providing the necessary money, Goetbals was prepared to start a shipbuilding campaign at once, and intended, so far as I. know, to pay fair priocs for the necessary steel.   He expected to pay about        a lb. for ship plate when the ourrent market for that class of material ranged from 0^ to ltjjf per lb. and the Japanese and other foreign buyers were freely Offering 10j^ and in s6me cases more.   Goethalc was willing to pay 4^ against a price1 of 2-9/lQ^ which had been arranged for about 600,000 tons for the ISavy,&quot; because he realised that it would be necessary to ha-re/the tfail Capacity of the country available, and because he further realised that he would get the best eo-roperation and the promptest delivery from everybody, if he set a, price that v/ould allow even the high cost people id get out even, or perhaos to have a slight pfofit.Denman, for political reasons opposed aoeth&amp;ls and the matter has been dragging qvqt since.   The result has been that it is impossible to arrive at any definite prices for steel with any Government official.    The President hes apparently issued an order that no prices shall be made until the completion of an investigation now under way by the Federal Trade Commission, of the cost of producing various forms of steel.     In the meentine, however, the necessity for placing certain orders apparently became so urgent that our Steel Committee was summoned to Washington on July 11th for a conference, at which the Government was represented by Secretaries of tho Mar and the Wavy, the Chairman of the Shipping Board and B.M.Bfiruch, who is Chairman of the Committee on metals of the Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defense,   We spent all of one day and part of the next finding out that the only basis that v?e could do business on was to agree to accept Government orders and wait for, the prices to be determined later on.     It was proposed to pay us something on account pending the fixing of final prices, and        a lb. was suggested;   but as this figure is much below the cost of many of the manufacturers, and would undoubtedly have some influence on the price to be finally set, we thought it best to agree to accept the orders and let the matter orprice wait.
It is the desire of the Administration that the  Hies should be supplied at the same prices as our own Government but the steel makers refused to accept the Allies1 orders until the price is definitely set, fearing fron the expressions of opinion jiven by Secretary Daniels, that the price would bo so low as to be very unsatisfactory, considering the proportion of the manufacturers1 output that will be neoes-eary. to supply the Allies as well as our own Government,   Of course, if the price is set at a reasonable figure, the manu-faoturers will be glad to include the AlliesT orders at that price,notwithstanding the urgency for placing orders, ten day3 have gono by since we arrived at this understanding and no orders have been plaoad as yet, beyond one or two trifling tonnages which were already in negotiation.   In the meanwhilej Gen. Goethals, feeling that the steel.situation had been settled, announced that he would promptly place his contracts for vessels, but Denman, availing himself of his right by law to approve all contracts made by Goethals, insisted on a let of additional information being given him by Goethals, and the shipbuilding program    is again held up.   There is now some indication that pressure has been put upon Denman, as his attitude is rather more conciliatory;   but nevertheless tbf shipbuilding program is standing still.   This, in my judgment, is pretty nearly a orime, and the President ought to have settled the matter long ago,Goethals, in my judgment, is perfectly right iti his attitude and is unquestionably the man for the job.   Denman is a political appointee, a former Admiralty lawyer from the Pacific Coast and his actions, so far are just about those of a strong pro-German sympathiser,     I don1t know anything definitely about his past histery, as to whether he over has been or was pro-German but at least his present action lays him open to that suspicion.The situation, as regards steel prices, is complicated by the fact that many of the manufacturers of shipbuilding material do not control their raw materials and their costs are consequently very high.   Take for instanoo your old friend, David Heeves, of the Phoenix Iro$ Company, who no longer, operates any blast furnaces, but starts with purchased pig iron and scrap.   He tells me that his oosts for ship angloa, channels, and beams is about 3-3/4^ per lb.and if he had to go out and buy his pig iron and sorap at the present market, it would run well over 4p and possibly might reach 5^ per lb.Some of the Government people expect to solve thie difficulty by paying different prices to different manufao-  . turers for the same material, but this does not seem economically sound to me, and I don?t quite see how it will work out in practice.   There should be no objection to paying, prices which will enable manufacturers to secure a fair profit because under the proposed war tax bill,, excess .prof its, which are to be figured substantially on the British basis, are taxed up to 50$ and can of coursa be. taxed higher, if necessary.The delay is working to the disadvantage of theAlliee/
Alliesi France, for instance, through [ organ &amp; Company, wanted us to postpone deliveries of our shell steel con-tracts for the last half of this year, as they already have no loos*than half a million tons at the seabbard awaiting vessels, and Morgan wanted us to substitute 60,000 tons of rails for the British to be used in France.   We arrived at a satisfactory price which was based bh giving us approximately the same profit as we would,have had from the shell steely but the question had to be referred to ITortkcliffe and ho apparently has been1afraid to accept our fcffer, the price of which is probably between ^10. and ^20. per ton higher than the price at which the Government will probably pay, ofalng to his fear of antagonising his banker, which is the United States Government at Washington.   In the meantime we continue to manufacture shell steel which is not nefeded and the British will wait for their rails.The faots are that notwithstanding all the talk of the wonderful things they are accomplishing at Wash-ington, the situation down there is almost chaotic^ and it is next to impossible to accomplish anything.   Nobody seemB to have any authority to do business and politics dominate   everything that is done. he business men of this oountry have from the start been.ee anxious as   it :is possible for any one to be to Berve the Government loyally and patriotically and supply it with any and every material needed.   But up to-date there has not been very touch really accomplished-   It is quite comprehensible that Congress should take a little time to decide some of the very important questions of legislation that are put before them, particularly ih view of the enormous powers which it is proposed shall be con-ferred upon the President, but when Congress has once acted, it is pretty tough to Sit still and see nothing, done while some politicians air their differences in the newspapers *I have no doubt but that the British and the French would havo mode Btrong prcteste long ago were it not that they were depending upon 6ur people for the money to continue prosecuting the War.The copper people had a   price agreed on and orders had been placed by the War Department, and then the very man who placed the orders had to write a letter stat-ing that by instructions from his superiors, he was forced to notify them that the orders already placed were can* celled.The coal men, in ajneeting presided over by the Secretary      the Interior, agreed to certain masimum prices for coalj and the whole country rejoiced at the very patriotic act.   Immediately the Secretary of War came out with a letter stating that the Secretary of the Interior had no authority to make any such arrangement, and that the same was null and void.To business people   accustomed to doing things up promptly, the delay and confusion is incomprehensible and deplorable to the last degree.Affectionately yours,(Sgd)       S.A.S. CLARKE.
