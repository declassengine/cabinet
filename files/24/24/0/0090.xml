OPERATIONS.S E C R E T,From : - General Barter,Moscow,ToC.I.G.SWar Office.No-,number.   August 25th.   Handed in 26th 2.50 p,m.-: To-day I attended the opening of the Moscow conference.Kerenski made a speech of hysterical and snarling character. He threatened Bolshiviki directly and military chief by allusion.   The French and other diplomatic representatives were there in diplomatic boxes but no British official except myself.Kerenski admitted reluctantly necessity of death penalty but maintained soldiers r committee mixed courts martial and commissariat (sic) with the army.Most important announcement was that Finns were hostile and that Government were taking measures to prevent them from turning against the Russians.His speech was devoted to defence of Government and to safety of revolution; no reference was made to measures for defenoe or safety of Russia.Speech made unfavourable impression on the whole because it contained no definite pronouncement of policy and dealt too much with merely party and personal questions when there is -anarchy in the interior and demoralization at front. I think it will seriously damage Government which has missed, its chance to prolong its existence by a frank endorsement of Korniloff programme.My private opinion is that a climax is rapidly (? approach)Ing and that the present Government will soon be replaced bya Bolshevist ministry which in its turn will be Immediatelyknocked out by a military counter revolution.Military party is fast gaining in power and is now beingsupported by the best elements of the nation,Savinkoff, Minister of War, has resigned in order to supportKorniloff/On
On 23rd inst.. an important meeting of this party was held here with Rodzianka as president at which Alexeieff and Brusilov and other military chiefs were present as well as the most influential members of the moderate party in the Duma.The meeting was as I heard in conversation with Alexeieff today most successful as regards unanimity of opinion and firm deter-mination.Kcrnilcff sagaciously postponed his arrival until tomorrow. Tomorrow I shall- pay formal visit to Kerenski.
