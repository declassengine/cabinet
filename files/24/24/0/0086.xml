1 secret Department of InformationI &quot; Intelligence Bureau.FSW/010MY   REPORT   OH   SPAIH.   X August&quot; 28th, 1917.The week that has elapsed since the last report Was written has confirmed the view then taken that the General Strike and accompany-ing attempts at a Revolution have &quot;both completely failed. But they were not&apos; reps?essedwithout serious loss of life.     Even at Barcelona4where, according to the British Ambassador, the rioters showed little inclination to face the forces at the disposal of the Govern-ment, the official statement a&amp;iaits the death of 37 persons:   and many deaths occurred in other towns.     It was found necessary to make a large number of arrests, and some executions, notably those of the miscreants who tried to wreck a train at   Bilbao, have already taken place.     But the Government seems now disposed to temper its victory by clemency and a great number of those arrested hove already b:en released.     It may be hoped that the whole episode will soon be a mere event in the past.An attempt has been made in some quarters, now that the movement has failed, to assert that it was merely a strike and had no political goal in view. .   This is absurd.     It is certain that all its leaders were anti-Honerchical and that if they had got the upoer hand of the Government, no concessions short of revolutionary change would have satisfied them.     It is true that the main body of Parliamentary Republicans and the Catalan Deputies gave no supoort to the strike and now declare, with how much truth it is impossible to say, that they knew nothing of its organisation.     Probably the more prudent and patriotic of them disapproved of such violent methods of political reform:   and the rest were waiting to see if the storm would bring the fruit down, in which ease they would have been quite ready to put it in their pockets.     It is almost certain that at lee*e
least some of them were behind it:   one Deputy has been arrested: and it is rumoured that Senor Lerroux, the Republican leader,has fled to France.     Of its definitely Republican character the language of its friends outside Spain leaves no doubt.     Unfortunately the con-duct of certain French newspapers and individuals has nrovided some Justification for the assertions of pro-German Spaniards that the Allies were fomenting Revolution in Spain.     Both the anti-Stockholm and fervently patriotic H. Eervl of the Victoire and the pro-Stockholm and partially pacifist Socialists of the Humani    wrote a series of articles during the crisis acclaiming the Revolution, predicting its success and wishing it well as .a blow struck in the cause of the Entente.     And, still more unfortunately, one Breal&apos; the chief of the French Propaganda in Spain, has acted with such indiscretion, to say the least, that he has exposed himself to arrest at Bilbao, while a French resident of Corunna has been excelled from the country.These are regrettable incidents which will not improve the re-lations between France and Spain.     It is to be hoped that theevidence, in which Sir Arthur Hardinge believes, of German inetiga-tion of the trouble at Bilbao may be conclusive and may obliterateunfortunate ^in the minds of the Spanish Government tbe/follies of IvI. Breal.Certainly it is obvious enough, excent to international theorists, that Germany has much more to gain than the Allies from Spanish revolutionary disturbance.     In Spain, as elsewhere, the interest of the Allies is in ordered liberty and political progress.     If Senor Dato takes the advice of Count Romanones, the most openly pro-Ally of official Spanish statesmen, whose paper protests against any tendency to use the revolutionary disorder as an excuse for a step backwards, this will be the policy he will follow.     Meanwhile his
firmness and success have   certainly greatly incre.--.sed his prestige end the strength of his position.     He seems to have fully justified t&amp;e confidence which Sir Irthur H^rdinge expressed in his &quot;calmness and and vigour&quot; at the time of the Barcelona affair in July;   and to have shown that he is not only more friendly to the Allies but also more capable Of governing Spain than his predecessor the Marquis of Alhuceroas.Meanwhile he has at any rate a respite.     Nothing more has been heard of the frontier meeting of Regionalist Senators and Deputies which was to have takam place on August 16th, at Oviedo or elsewhere, and according to the Catalan leader, Senor Cambo, was to have had a larger attendence than the Barcelona meeting and to have insisted on a meeting of the Cortez and no Dissolution.     Senor Dato told Sir Arthur HVrdinge in July that if another meeting were attempted it would simply be dispersed by the police, without arrests, or anything that would give the Deputies the chance of nosing as heroes or martyrs.     But he will have to decide the auestion of a Dissolution soon:   and i  it is one of the old sham order it seems certain that it will not allay the unboubted dissatisfaction of the country.   A country of which a writer who knows many of its political leaders can say, as one has lately said, that all of them vehemently declared to him that the greatest evil it suffered from was politics, is a country which provides plenty of anxiety for its Prime Minister.Meanwhile in other fields than politics Spain is very prosperous, She is embarrassed by the gold the war has brought her;   when it started the Bank of Spain held   2,000,000 of gold;    it now holds  68,000,000.     Her exports of such things as hoots and cotton and woollen goods have multiplied threefold and fourfold.     But there is another side to the picture.     The profits of all this have gone into the hands of the traders.     The people have benefited scarcely at all
and they have suffered from the higher prices of food *?nd from thefailure of some pr-rts of the export trade, such &amp;$ that of fruit.perhaps it is to another field that we must look for more p*emanentgrounds of optimism about the future in Spain.     Such prosperity, asthe war brings will end with it.     Nor will material prosperityprovide the regeneration of which Spain stsnds most in need.     Thereis good reason for thinking thot the most permanently hopeful move-ment now at work in Spain is that of r Committee of EducationalReformers who ?re endeavouring to nut into /practice the ideas oftheir founder, Don Francisco Giner de los Rios.     They received therecognition of a Royal Decree in January 1907 which constituted themofficially as a Board of Education and Scientific Research.     Al-ready they have set in motion a wave of new life which is passingthrough the whole of the Spanish educational world from the elementaryschool to the University.     Ml recognise that the quickest for Spainis University    Ato get modern ideas of education/for her young/men to spend part oftheir time in fetching them from abroad.     -Ind this was being in-creasingly done before the war with financial assistance from theGovernment.     It is to be hoped that the British University authoritieswill giviar all the assistance they can to a movement which is mostflattering to us:   for it is said that its promoters after studyingother European systems of education have made the English their chiefmodel.     The whole movement is well described in an article in theContemporary Review for August where it is shown that those who areleading it comprise representatives of all opinions religious andpolitical.     Let us hope that it will prove to be what one of its   *founders has called it, the thing of all things that Spain most needs,La Revolucion Pecifica.26.8.1V. J.CB.
