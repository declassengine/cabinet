 &quot;&quot;&apos; &quot;   - 7AR CABDTET..G.T. - 1849   .LABOUR 111 REVOLT.Mev0randum by Professor,g^V., Arnold of&apos;Bapg^r University/ -     &quot;   &quot;     &quot;   &apos; * I(Circulated to the &apos;7ar Cabinet at the r^iwst of \Lord Milner). -This is an attempt to describe the present pbeitlcjn of the movement which I call &quot;Labour in Revolt, &quot;-and which its promoters call &quot;the working-class movement&quot; or &quot;the class war.&quot;    The bare facts are known to the public and the Government;   the growing strength of the movement, and the; passionate, revolutionary-fervour with which it is supported, are not appreciated.     Thus the position is very similar to that of the Pan-German movement before the outbreak of the present war, or the Sinn Fein movement before the Dublin rebellion.My information comes from the periodicals which circulate in the interests of the movement, and from individuals who are promoting it.     As none of these ask for secrecy or confidence, I conclude that I am not bound to any secrecy,, especially as it is in the best interests of the parties concerned that their state of mind should be thoroughly understood.This movement is quite distinct from the &quot;Pacifist&quot; movement, which is middle-class, and from the &quot;Revolutionary&quot; movement proper, which is confined to the lower class of the large towns, and is nost vigorous in East London. The movement I describe is that of well-paid artisans. But all three movements are apt to combine in public demonstrations; and so are confuted in the public eye.The strongholds, of &quot;Labour in Revolt&quot; are the South Wales mine-field, the dockers everywhere, the Clyde shipyards, and the Manchester and Sheffield districts.     The movement has only gained, a solid position in the last two districts within the last six months, but it is jusfc this extension which gives ground for alarm.&quot;Labour in Revolt&quot; is led by young men from 20 to 40 years of age.     The older Trades Union Leaders hold entirely aloof from it and cannot understand it.     Nor can they resist it.     Of all people they are the least competent advisers with regard to it.     A decided majority of the workmen are everywhere opposed to it, but nevertheless they are swept sway by it.      It has repeatedly brought them increases of wages and reductions of hours, for which they are grateful.     But chiefly they recognise that the movement is strong and that the Government is weak, and, like the majority everywhere, they incline to the stronger party,The young men and young women of the movement, after making all allowances, must be counted by many thousands, All of them think and act in precisely the same way: their knowledge and their ignorance is the same:    their eloquence is remarkable;    and they always act first and reaso afterwards.    They have no leaders and need, none.    They care nothing for disappointments or defeats, but rise each time with fresh zeal for the next effort.
They greatly underrate the forces which will ultimately be opposed to them, and arc absolutely confident of victory for their ideas in the very near future. Societies like the W.E.A. belong to the movement to a manj and :it must be remembered-that the W.E.A. itself is under the ban of the more advanced section of the movement, as being a body which exposes itself to a &apos; corrupting contact with capitalist or middle-class universities.The ideas of &quot;Labour in Revolt&quot; are Htrude enough, but the believers accept them with absolute sincerity.   They are ideri-tical \vith the theories of the Russian,revolution.   Karl tearx is the Bible of the.faith.  ?The world,is divided into Capitalists and&quot;the xroletariat or Labour. .Bv^a natural law Labour always produces more than enough for its^eeds: the surplus is stolen from it by Capitalism, and used to enslave Labour. &quot;British-exports&quot; mean that&apos;the British capitalist, after first compelling his -wage-*slaves to work for their own needs, next compels&apos;them to work to make exports to.foreign capitalists, and further still to make profits for;himself.   If the pro-, jetariat restricts output euccesfully,  at the worst-they willalways have enough for. themselves, and the capitalist alone will suffer.   All wars are caused &quot;by the rival ambitions, of the capitalists Of different nations, and are carried on at the sole cost of Labour.   The proletariat of all nations must rise against the capitalists of all.nations, and destroy their power.&quot;&quot;&quot;Labour; In- Revolt&quot; absolutely denies all patriotic ties. The- result of the present war is entirely indifferent to its members:   England is not their country, and the war is. not their war. &apos; The ideavthat Germany might inva$* England is a bogey raised by the Capitalist to make the workman .obey him.To conscription, munitions Acts, and to any sort of discip-line   ih the workshops, &quot;Labour in Revolt&quot; is absolutely opposed.It has no programme for a reconstructed Society. All schemes, such as those of Trade Council or National;Guilds are middle class devices to thwart the devolution.   But the movement has a dear policy:   that is to strike first one blow and then another, until       Society collapses.   Compromises or reconciliation it entirely rejects.It has no. designs against ling George, and no ill-will against individual capitalists.   These considerations are outside its purview.   The Russian devolution is the realisation of its ideals: every criticism of it in this country is due to the malevolence of the capitalists.   Perhaps the words &quot;angelic anarchy&quot; may summarize the objective best.oneSuch is the doctrine preached week by week from/end of the country to the other.   The.listeners are no doubt only half convinced, but each utterance makes the theories more familiar.It will be said that these are the doctrines of a few enthusiasts, and that they will never win over the adherence of the mass of shrewd British workingmcn.   In support of this view it is possible to point to the crowd of. Sunday new papers,/
which form the chief reading of the average working-man; and all of which are full of patriotic sentiments and of more or less effective criticism of these very doctrines.   It is however possible to underrate the effect of an ardent propaganda such as has been described.There have lately been issued a series of reports on &quot;Industrial UnrestX    I believe only one, that on Wales, treats this propaganda as a serious danger. The facts are however otherwise.During the last six month3 recruiting has been brought almost to a standstill, and the munitions Acts have been made a dead letter by a series of strikes or strike-threats in all parts of tho Kingdom.   Before these threats Government authority has completely, or at any rate generally, collapsed, it has arrested conspirators, and then set them free again.   It has rewarded the strikers by in-creaBed wageB, although these lead to increased con* sumption just when economy is most necessary.   The proposals for &quot;dilution in private work&quot; declared by one Minister of Munitions to be essential for the conduct of the war, have been abandoned in obedience to the result of a ballot, of which no newspaper has been permitted to publish a report.For this movement which has thus humbled Government there are many subsidiary causes, but the driving force has been &quot;Labour in Revolt&quot;.     The men who have preached, canvassed and organised against the Government have been men with the ideals just described: and they have used the grievances and dis-contents of the men as weapons against their patriotism. The number of loyal and patriotic workers, once very large, is now rapidly dwindling.Having successfully established their power and trampled on their opponents, &quot;Labour in Revolta has next turned its hand to the peace scheme which matured at the Labour Conference on August 10th/ 1917.   All. the newspapert comments and criticism on the Stockholm Meeting quite miss the central point, namely that this is a scheme by which the International Proletariat will establish peace over the heads of all Governments\     This aim is not avowed in so many words by all its adherents: but Mr. R Smillie, President of the Miners1 Federation,, let it out when he said that the workmen would &quot;compel&quot; the Governments to make peace.   And the Miners&apos; Federation, it may be remembered, is reputed to be one of the sanest of the large. Trades Unions.All last week the newspapers prophesied the rejection of the Stockholm proposal, or its acceptance by a small majority.   Lven now the Government attributes the result to negligence on the part of Mr. Henderson to state the view of the Russian Government.According to my information, all this is quite incorrect, and come3 from information derived from the old TradesUnion leaders,, who are now quite out of the running.   The real leaders knew a full week earlier that the proposal would be carried by an overwhelming majority: they care nothing for the view of the Russian &quot;Government&quot;: and whilst, as a matter of form, they accept the word &quot;consultative&quot;, their real intention is to force the British Government to accept the results at which they may arrive..   They welcome Mr. Henderson&apos;s resignation as a stunning blow to the Government.
; . 163(4)Mr.Lloyd George.with clearer insight hcus recognised this. He sets up &quot;The nation (Le. Parliament) must make peace&quot;, as against &quot;Labour will make peace&quot;.     But &quot;Labour&quot; is stronger than Parliament at presentiThe dangers of this movement are as followsl-(1) By continually foroing up wages they are raising the costof the war to suoh figures as threaten the financial stability of the oountry, and by decrying thrift, they are helping to waste its resources in commodities.(2) - By keeping the Government continually &quot;on the jump&quot; throughfear of strikes they are undermining confidence in lawful authority.(3) By an aotual strike on a large scale, such as must occurone day,, however often it is bought off by paying blackmail, it will paralyse for any period from one v/eek to three months the economy of the country and the administration of the war. The fear of a strike in South ^ales being most lively in the   -mind of the Government, the theorists of South Wales have the game in their own hands,(4) Aotive violence is not contemplated;   it ma^ neverthelessocour.break down again.     Such appeals&quot;are looked upon as the first and clearest signs of coming, surrenderIt is not the intention of this paper to propose remedies., The orushing of such a movement is one of the ordinary tasks of Government, and almost any method,! within reason, will crush it if oarried out with decision and courage.     But I do not myself believe that it can now be done without a ,serious Conflict.If I were to name one particular measure more likely to be effeotive than another, it would be an individual ballot of the members of the big unions on the broad question whether they would or would not &quot;make the sacrificesnecessary to uphold the British position 5 in the war&quot;.     The leaders of the &quot;Revolt&quot; believe such a ballot would go against themselves.But even this could be only an incident in. a policy to be carried out by a man, who (in the opinion of the workmen) is prepared to go through with:it to the end, at the risk of his position or his life,&apos;    So long as the &quot;Revolt&quot; can depose a Minister of Munitions at its will, it oan (and even a much weaker movement could) defy all authority.     Of the ultimate danger which &quot;ould result from a Britioh defeat by land or sea, these men have no thought, nor is it possible- to bring such things within their intellectual range.     They need a ruler who at the same time understands them,&apos;and who takes a sane, and not a merely emotional.view of the whole world-position.In, saying this I am not assenting personally to the officialh^wJ8 ?\t0 Britieh ^r-aims, v/hich I fear are doing much harm both at home and abroad.     But; this is another issue.August 1917.
Extract from a letter by the seme writer, dated 16th.Aug,1917.As to the Labour Party^ peace terms, I see an inter-esting speech by J.E.Thomas in today!s papers, which I expect to find represents the position very fairly.But I think the &quot;Labour Party&quot; should be very carefully distinguished from the &quot;Labour Revolt.&quot;    V3iilst the former goes on talking with considerable show of reason, the latter continues its resistance to all Government measures.     The area of strikes is increasing and the resistance to recruit-ing is complete.There was an interesting article on the whole question by Lord Sydenham in last SundayTs &quot;Weekly Dispatch&quot;-     As to the danger of revolution he is rather more alarmist than I am. But on one point he agrees with me completely, that, during the last twelve months there has been a regular landslide in the attitude of the great mass of unionist workingmen.     Then they were working for victory over the Germans,, now it is for victory over &quot;society&quot;.     As he well puts it, &quot;They are not the majority, but they are organised;    and the unorganised majority is powerless against them&quot;.Perhaps you may have noticed that the peace-terms proposed by pacifists are the sternest of all.     It is a very easy thing to demand high terms if you take no responsibility for enforcing them..
