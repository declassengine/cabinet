Reference to Secretary of State&apos;s telegram dated 14th August re Mesopotamia Administration.I sent Army Commander a copy. In reply Chief of General Staff writes as folloavs: (1) Army Commander has not yet received any communication on the subject from Government, but takes it for granted that one will follow.(2) Meanwhile Army Commander considers that there need be no delay in carrying out wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and suggests that a force routine order be published notifying my assumption of title of Civil Commissioner.(3) As regards submission of reports Army Commander suggests that they should be addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government direct, provided that I send him a copy of all such reports before despatch in order that he may talk over with me any points raised therein prior to their being sent off.(4) As regards attachment of a General Staff Officer to me Army Commander suggests that I am in such close touch with General Staff, and that relations of &quot;Intelligence Branch with my Office are so intimate that nothing would be gained by such an appointment.My comment is as follows : 1. Nil.2. I concur if His Majesty&apos;s Government approve.3. I accept procedure proposed provided that it is understood that it involves no specific obligation on my part to modify reports after discussion with Army Commander unless I see good reason to do so.4.
