iaSDiCAIi, BOARDS. (Mote by l r. Munro).In Paragraph 5 of my Memorandum, G. T. 1791, I expressed the view that the control of Medical Boards in Scotland should be transferred to the Secretary for Scotland (whose functions In this matter correspond to those of the local Government Board in England! and Wales).I have since discussed the question with Sir Auckland Geddes and understand that as1 ah alternative io control by the-local Government Board and the Secretary for Scotland a scheme has been proposed briefly as follows:- &apos;The primary medical examination io be conducted by a local Medical Board under the   Mhtional Service Department with a right to the man to apply to the Appeal Tribunal for authority to obtain re-examination by a. body of doctors appointed by the local Government -Board (or the Secretary for Scotland in Scotland) and -&apos;- -Occupying the position of an appeal Ifedical Board (whether or not it is so designated). .&apos; I assume (though this i3 not expressed in the scheme) that for the. primary Medical 3oards there would be a panel of doctors (nominated by the Hedical V/ar Committees representing the profession) from which the members of the Boards would be selected according to a definite rota or some other automatic system and that the National Service Department would have no influence over the selection: also that the instructions to the primary Hedical Boards would be issued in consultation with the Local Government Board and the Secretary for Scotland (whose present association with tho Local and Appeal Tribunals would necessarily continue) and that the appeal Medical Boards would be absolutely independent and their decisions final;3.     I
I regret that I do not feel able to concur in the foregoing proposal (even if it includes the conditions specified in paragraph 2) because I believe that if it received effect it would not be. endorsed by public opinion as satisfactorily meeting the situation dealt with by the Shortt Committee.     The Committee resolved on 19th July that &quot;the whole organisation of Recruiting Medical Boards and of medical examinations and re-examinations should be transferred to the.Local Government Board&quot;u (the Secretary for Scotland in Scotland).     The main reason inspiring this resolution was, I think, the desire of the Committee that the control of the Medical Boards should not rest with the recruiting authority; and they accordingly recommended that the whole organisation should be removed from the War Office and placed under civilian control. &apos; The removal of the recruiting department to civilian control does not seem to me to fulfil the spirit of the resolution so long as that department&apos; retains any control over or association with medical examinations; and speaking for Scottish&apos;opinion I am apprehensive that it would be far frcm satisfied, by the present&apos; proposal and consider that the matter calls for further discussion.(&amp;f^*f) ROBER2 MllffiO.SoofrffclSn Office.27th August 1917.
