OPERATIONS.SECRET.From .:- General Barter,Russia.ToC.I.G.S.War Off ice.22.8.17. 6.51 p.m.1204,This morning I saw Korniloff and communicated your telegram No. 39852 to him.   He was very pleased and begged me to transmit his sincere appreciation.He showed me a number of resolutions which he has received in the last two days from various councils representing organisations of officers, veterans etcassuring him of their emphatic support.He also informed me that he has been called by Government to Petrograd to discuss his programme, before attending Moscow Congress and he added with significant expression of face that he did not know if he could find time to go. I laughed and said, that as he could not take a train full of his Turcomans with him, I should, if I were he, find that work was too pressing to allow him to leave G.H.Q. before going to Moscow.Turcomans referred to are a wild cavalry regiment which he recently called to G.H.Q,., and which is wholly devoted to him as his mother was one of the tribe.     He is safe from coup de main, as battalion of St. George, which has also declared its fidelity to Korniloff, is permanently   quartered here.He was very anxious to know what the policy of the Allied Powers is as regards diplomatic pressure.   He is a genuine patriot and would rather attain his object by peaceable means.     In any case it is very doubtful if the time is yetripe
1ripe ior playing a very high stake at a different game. I expressed regret that I had no information.     (One group undecipherable) I am informed on good authority that Government-s latest intention is to suppress post of Commander-in-Chief and to appoint a War Council, which would sit in Petrograd and be directly under Kerenski.     .Thie measure, if it is really contemplated, as I believe, may bring matters to an early and violent crisis.I leave iiugust 10th for Petrograd and shall return by August 16th.
