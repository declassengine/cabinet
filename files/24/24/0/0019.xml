R b)irector of Military Intelligence, War Office.British Embassy.Rome. 16th. August. 1917.Reported regrettable incidents in the Italian Army.During a visit to the front from which I have just returned I made it my business to verify the truth or otherwise of the reported cases of surrender $0 the enemy mentioned in my report if0.537. of the 9th July. 1*17.I obtained some interesting information of which the -following is a summary:-During the Hay offensive at the time of the Austrian counter-attacks to the West of I1.HER1IADA one Italian battalion abondoned their arms and surrendered bodily to the enemy. This weakened the Italian line and contributed to the subsequent retirement in that neighbourhood which caused the Italians to loose much of the ground gained during the previous days fighting.Somewhere about the same time a serious incident ocoured it PAL1CA1T0VA.     Two Italian regiments, stated to have been th^ 1list, and 142nd. but I cannot vouch for these numbers being correct as I have also hs^rd the l-&quot;&apos;:9th, regiment mentioned, had been brought back from the front to rest.      They were ordered back again earlier than **as anticipated with the result that there was a disturbance luring which some of the officers were killed by their men,     Urder was subsequently re*-established and a number of men tried and shot. The two regiments were then conveyed back to the firing line in lorries each lorry being followed by another containing a machine-gun trained on the one in front of it.    It is likely that these two affairs gave rise to the reports current in Rome..&quot;-friile in GRADI3CA I was informed that a disturbance had recently taken place at SDRAUBSIHA close &quot;by.     Uy informant had heard much 3houting and shots were fired,.    The troops in the lower IS01IZA were stated to be much discouraged by the failure of the Hay offensive and it was generally considered of great importance in the interest of Italy13 further participation in the war that the next offensive,, shortly to be commenced, should prove successful..[Signed) Charles A, Lamb, Colonel.-Military Attache.
