Service Department.I.E.G., ROBERTS. (Minis tor of Labour) expressed- the. vieW that it was most undesirable that the functions connected with the trans fer of ordinary civil labour should bo associated with the Department that undertook recruiting for the Army, and that any such association would arouse not merely suspicion but resent-ment in the labour world.     He pointed out that one of the conditions   upon ,which labour entered the present Government was the prompt establishment of a Ministry of Labour as a permanent Department.     This permanent Department required the machinery of the Labour Exchanges for the&apos;administration of \memployment benefit and similar functions.     He had always, understood that the National Service Department was a special department tempor-arily established for war purposes, end not a permanent MinistrySIR AUCgLAUD GBDDES. pointed out that the War Cabinet (War Cab-inet 39, Minute 1,&apos; para.(g) IV ) had on January 19th, 1917 laid down that &quot;the Employment Exchanges should remain under the control of the Minister of Labour, who undertook to place them at the disposal of.the Director General for the organisation of Hational Service&quot;.    -He stated that there had been no real loan of the Labour Exchanges, end that as a result there was a duplication of machinery \*hich was proving fatal to the satis-factory working of any mon-po^/zer policy.     An attempt had been made to work the policy laid down by.the Cabinet by means of a joint committee but this&apos;had broken clown and the alternative of 4ifferentiating between   the functions of the Labour Exchaiiges and the national Service-, scheme had also broken down.
The late Minister of Labour (Mr. Hodge) had agreed with him that matters were not satisfactory. Now that the National Service Substitution Volunteers had been placed upon exactly the same footing as War Munition Volunteers one of the great obstacles to co-ordination had been removed. The other National Service volunteers had practically ceased to exist and he hoped that it might be possible to arrange that all classes of transferable labour should be treated in the same way and thus differences of conditions of employment might be eliminated. War Munition Volunteers were only available for work under the Ministry of Munitions, while National Service Volunteers were available for Admiralty and Army contracts work as well.

SIR DAVID SHACKLETON agreed that the placing of the National Service Substitution volunteers on the same terms as regards pay and allowances so obtained for War Munition volunteers made a great difference for the better in the direction of co-operation and co-ordination. He urged the impracticability of the transfer of the Labour Exchange Organisation to an Army recruiting department and the impossibility of the organisation serving two masters. It was Sir Auckland Geddes to lay down the policy and the labour exchanges to carry it out. He did not desire that the Ministry of Labour should become responsible for deciding the questions of priority or the quantities of labour to be transferred to particular trades or Government departments. This was a matter entirely for Sir Auckland Geddes, but the question of the conditions of employment and machinery of transfer were essentially ones for the Ministry of Labour to decide.

SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES agreed with the general principles laid down in the latter part of Sir David Shackleton&apos;s statement and thought that some arrangement might be come to similar to that which pertained between Mr. Rey and the Labour Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions. The actual transfer of the whole machinery was not necessary provided, there was a real loan of the machinery, and provided there was one individual authority to carry out (subject to the War Cabinet decisions) the Man-Power Policy. Above all duplicate machinery would be fatal.

The Committee decided 

(1) That the Minister of Labour and Minister of National Service should sec Mr. F.C. Rey and report whether a scheme on the lines suggested and analogous to that pertaining between the Ministry of Munitions and the Labour Exchange Department could be established in regard to all classes of transferable labour.


(2)   That the Minister of Labour shouldprepare a statement&apos;-for the Committee as to how far it would be possible to bring all classes of transferable labour into line with the War Munition Volunteers and National Service Volun-teers in order to get rid of the difficulties arising from difference of conditions of service and enrolment.Z TftiitehallV GardensS .V). :    24th August, 1517.U 0 T BIt jg requested that&apos;&quot;&amp;ng.corrections to the:aboye.^l^^,,&apos;giay oe aenS -----g early -aa. possible, to &quot;hi
