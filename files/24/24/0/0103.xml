Any further communication should be addressed not to any individual by name,but to  &apos;The Director, Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1. and should quote the Reference Number and Date of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address: &quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot; %^tonres^^iCTORiA 8240.I beg to submit the following Report of the Food Production Department for the week ended 28th AugustWeather and the Harvest. The heavy rains and tempestuous weather which have been almost everywhere experienced during the past week have had a disastrous effect on the harvest.   Owing to the laid condition of the corn, due to the storms of a fortnight ago, the gathering of the harvest would, in any case, have been difficult and slow, but this fresh visitation of stormy weather has created a situation the seriousness of which can scarcely be exaggerated. The Department^ Commissioners report that great anxiety prevails among farmers in almost every district.In spite of the long drought of May and June last, the crops a few weeks ago were, speaking generally, in a very promising condition, but at present the outlook is exceedingly discouraging.   In districts in the South of England where corn ripens early a large proportion of the grain has already sprouted, and further heavy losses have resulted from damage done by the recent storms.A great reduction in the yield of this yearfs harvest, is, therefore, inevitable and is most disappointing in view of the very large increase in the area under corn which resulted from the Department^ efforts in the early months of the year. It will be remembered that, in April the District Commissioners estimated that there would be an increase of 300,000 acres over(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)&quot;Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,ii344London, S.W. 1. 29th August, 1917.
the 1916 area devoted to corn crops and potatoes.   An early-official estimate, based on the average of 40 per cent, of the agricultural returns, showed that there was a prospect of this increase being not less that 347,000 acres.   On Saturday last the official Agricultural Returns were issued, and show that both the above figures were well below the result actually achieved. The area cropped with wheat, barley, oats and potatoes in &quot;England and Wales this year Is no less than 388,000 acres over and above the corresponding area in 1916, whilst an additional 35,000 acres has been devoted to roots.   This is independent of the very large, but incalculable, increase from gardens, small holdings and allotments.In view of the exceptional difficulties, in the way of weather and shortage of labour, with which agriculturists had to contend, these results must be considered as highly satisfactory and reflect the greatest credit on everyone concerned in the task of food production.LOCAL ORGANISATION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.Several of the Executive Committees are taking possession of land where the tenant, being under notice to quit at Michaelmas or Ladyday, will not cultivate for the 1918 crop.   The Committees are taking possession temporarily of only those parts of the farm which require such cultivation, and will withdraw from possession in favour of the new tenant.   Instances of such action are reported from Cambridgeshire, Somerset and West Suffolk.In Cheshire the Committee are taking possession of an 84 acre farm the tenant of which is serving with the forces and has been unable to obtain leave to attend to the farm.   The Bedfordshire Agricultural Executive Committee have held a conference with the Duke of Bedford&apos;s representatives, at which it has been arranged that tfoburn Park shall be used for six months
from 1st May in each year for the grazing of 200 head of cattle and 500 sheep.   In Durham the Committee have requested Lord Barnard to plough up 105 acres of grass land at Raby Castle and to treat the park with basic 3lag.Rabbits Order.Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Bedfordshire, Durham and Leicestershire.   Action is also reported in one case in Durham under the Rookeries Order.Drainage of Lands Order.In Bedfordshire the Committee have given notice to all the mill owners in the county to open- their sluices when the water reaches the height to which the mills are legally entitled.   The Committee are also arranging for the cleansing of various brooks in the parish of Aspley Guise.   In Cheshire the Committee have given notices under the first Drainage of Lands Order for the cleansing of the River Weaver and other water courses not mentioned in previous reports, and they are having an inspection made of the Arley Brook and its tributaries.   A number of inspections have been made by the Board!s Drainage Inspector in Lancashire, and the Committee are convening meetings of the owners interested in several of the areas inspected (the River Keer, the Sankey and Glaze Brooks near Harrington, and the Hest Bank near Morecambe Bay). The Committee are also issuing orders with regard to the Spen Dyke which drains into Blackpool, and on this subject they are working in concert with the Blackpool Corporation.   They have invited the co-operation of the Furness Railway Company and the Westmorland Agricultural Executive Committee with regard to the Silverdale Moss on the borders of the last named county.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2.)In the past week, reports have been received from three districts which have provided 555 applicants with plots, containing in the aggregate an area of 41 acres.
Revised statements, hov?ever, received from Brighton andCroydon show that in the earlier reports a large number ofplots provided by private enterprise in these Boroughs wereincluded;     The corrected figures, showing the provision ofallotments under the Defence of the Realm Regulations in the1,057 districts which have reported, are as follows:-Number of applications ......... 192,169.Number of plots provided ....... 173,725.Total area provided............   12,871 acres.&apos; &quot;   &quot;   HORTICULTURAL SECTION.Fruit and Vegetable Bottling.      164 demonstrations have been givenin different parts of the country, making a total of 1,705.The number of glass jars despatched by manufacturersduring the week is 332,564, making a total of -1,387,960;   thebalance remaining to be despatched is now only 206,658.Preserving Fruit and Vegetables.      The pulping stations now inoperation are as follows:-dealing with....Maidstone .... SittingbourneMarden .......Pershore Cheltenham Totnes .... Bournville (Messrs, Broom Junction (Under Board ofAgriculture).tons.60 per day. 20-30 7-1020Cadbury Bros).10 - 12 10 - 1215The above stations are., therefore, pulping approximately 1,000 tons of fruit per vreek.Premises thought to be suitable for drying stations have been inspected and reported on at Canterbury, Gravesend and Dartford.     Enquiry is being made with the object of utilising malt driers for the purpose of drying vegetables.The depot at the South Eastern College, Wye, which is to be used as a training centre for supervisors, is now almost equipped.     Reports received indicate that, the scheme for Vegetable drying is being welcomed by growers, many of-whom are actively co-operating in the work.
Arrangements for establishing drying stations at Dartford Canterbury, Paddock Wood, tfateringbury have been made.   At Dartford 100 tons of cabbage, which otherwise would have been wasted, have been dried and pressed, and packed in hop pockets.   Negotiations for the establishment of other depots are being made.   Messrs. Meux1 brewery at Nine Elms has been inspected with the object of using it as a drying station and training centre.   The Directors have offered very favourable terms.Mr. Riley, of the War Office Contracts Department, has applied to the Pood Production Department for a supply of dried vegetables. Contracts placed in Canada will be completed at the end of the year.   The Department has informed Mr. Riley that It anticipates that it will be in a position to deliver 100 tons of dried vegetables per week after Christmas, and 200 tons per week by the end of March.   It is hoped that it may be possible to exceed this amount.   The Army requirements are 1,000 tons a month. . Canners. The number of &quot;Home Canners&quot; sold during the week is 46, making a total of 86.   The number of cans sold during the week is 18,000, making a total of 39,600.Public demonstrations in canning have been given in Peterborough and Maidstone.   Great difficulty is being experienced through the delay of transit of both cans and canners. Potatoes for Bread-Making.   A test on a large scale on the baking qualities of flour containing whole potatoes has been made, and a report comprising the considered opinions of people who have sampled the loaves is being prepared.   The report will contain notes on the different methods by which potatoes may be used in bread-making, and it is hoped that a leaflet giving information on this subject may be issued shortly.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Costs of Production of Milk. A detailed report of an enquiry into the cost of producing milk during the winter of 1916-17 has been
submitted by the Sub-Committee appointed to consider this subject. The enquiry which was set on foot in Hay, 1917, aimed at collecting information from all types of dairy farms in a large number of different areas.   Data were collected almost entirely by correspondence, and information has been obtained on all items of costs, whereas most other enquiries of this character have been confined to costs of food.   In all, 43 useable returns relating to the winter period were received, and several others dealing with a longer period or compiled on a somewhat different basis. The figures have been separated into costs of production, and costs of transport and distribution.   Information has been obtained as regards the use and destination of milk, the relation of costs to prices, and economical methods of production. Inspection of Land.   A farm in Hampshire in the occupation of a Belgian has been inspected by one of the Advisory Officers at the instance of the Executive Committee.   The farm was found to be in very bad condition, but in view of the fact that the present tenant only obtained possession in April, and is apparantly anxious to improve the land, the Committee have been advised to defer action until it is seen what progress is made with, the autumn cultivation. Badly-harvested Grain. Enquiries are being made as to the practicability of using malt kilns for drying badly harvested grain, so as to render it better adapted for seed purposes and for storage. &quot;Seeds&quot; Mixtures.   The enquiry into this subject has been continued, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire having been visited during the week. In Lincolnshire useful data have been obtained, especially as to the formation of leys on very poor sand.   Several leys of known history on the Carboniferous Limestone and derived soil3 in the Bakewell district of Derbyshire, have been investigated, and observations made as to the general characteristics of the grassland in this district.
Plant Diseases.      Specimens have been examined and advice given in 36 cases of attacks by fund, and 25 by insects, the crop mostly concerned being potatoes.     Assistance has been given with respect to insects attacking -crops grown by the British Army in France.     A preliminary enquiry has been made as to the possibility of using barium chloride for insecticidal purposes as a substitute for arsenate of lead,LABOUR. &apos;Soldier Labour.      Reports received from the Department&apos;s Commissioners show that during the past week some 3,990 skilled and 3,478 unskilled men have been sent to the Distribution Centres. The numbers sent out to farmers during the week are 5,896 skilled and 3,195 unskilled.     The numbers remaining at the depots total 2,471 skilled and 3,852 unskilled.     There is still a general shortage of skilled ploughmen at most Distribution Centres.     So far as can be ascertained the number of soldiers, both skilled and unskilled, who have been supplied to date by the Far Office for the purposes of the 1918 Programme Is 22,746.     This includes about 14,000 originally furnished for harvest work. Horses.      The number of teams of horses sent out with skilled ploughmen now amounts to 850, an Increase of 121 over last week&apos;s total.     So far 26 counties have applied for teams, and it is evident that there will be a considerable demand directly farmers have finished harvest and are thus able to start ploughing, provided they can be assured that skilled ploughmen will be sent with the teams.Prisoners.       Considerable delay still occurs in getting prisonersof war employed, owing to the difficulty experienced by the WarOffice in getting the camps erected.Womenfs Branch.Returns received this week show that 6,610 women havebeen accepted under the National Service Scheme and 10,248rejected.     Of the number accepted 6,526 are accounted for as follows:-
In Instruction Centres........... 1,121On Farm Work ..................... 4,748Waiting for references to beplaced in Training Centres.. 151Waiting for employment In Depots.. 219Waiting in their own homes ....... 287The 500 to 600 National Service Volunteers now in depots are being gradually absorbed into work, for the most part closely connected with Food Production.     A certain number are engaged on fruit picking, and there are already demands for workers for the potato harvest.     Others have been taken by the Forage Department for hay baling and peat drying and stacking, and a considerable number are working at timber cutting.The predominantly Welsh counties in Wales have no National Service Volunteers unemployed and are not only able to place trained women at once but to absorb all those from the other Welsh speaking counties.     There is still a constant demand for experienced milkers and for women who can plough.     Several employers are now asking for women Motor Tractor drivers.The reports of the Group Leaders continue to be satisfactory, and several fresh gangs are being employed.     A Group Leader In Monmouthshire has arranged for her gang to be taught threshing. ,   The value of seasonal work is demonstrated by the following example.     A gang of educated seasonal workers in Brecon has given so much satisfaction that the employer has asked three of them to stay permanently;   they will probably become National Service Volunteers.In Denbighshire striking results have been obtained, thanks to the energy of the Organising Secretary who determined to convince the colliers in a certain village of the need for an increased supply of home grown food.     On her first visit to this village she found it in the midst of a dreary waste of black earth
and was assured that nothing could be done.   She spoke to a meeting of only half a dozen people.   However, they asked her to come again, which she did, and as a result of her three visits an Allotment Society was formed among the colliers and their wives. Everyone in the village has joined to make the scheme a success. The village now stands in the midst of an abundant vegetable plot, and the colliers are determined never to give up their allotments. As evidence of the extent of these allotments it may be mentioned that 12 tons of seed potatoes alone have been ordered.MACHINERY AND IMPLEivlENTS. Motor Tractors. Eighty-one additional tractors have been consigned to Executive Committees during the week bringing the total number of tractors so consigned up to 1,002.    In addition C3 tractors are on offer to counties for delivery as soon as they are assembled, and 60 Titan tractors have similarly been offered to Scotland. Harness. The position with regard to the supply of harness for the 30,000 horses which are to be purchased in connection -vith the Departments 1918 Programme is giving considerable anxiety.   The /following statement shows the orders placed for different items:--    :       Back                 Chain   Collars            Plough Nose Thill bands. Bridles, traces. &amp; hame Hames.   lines, bags. sets. :    &quot;_strap.___Ordered or on order fromContractors &amp;c.2,155   21,885   22,535   5,213   2,815      2,200 10.000   251xIssued or orders givenfor issue.        1,100     1,100     1,100   1,459   1,200_940 _355   ^-Balance to besupplied___1,055   20,785   21,455__3,754   1,615      1,260   9,645   251xLikely to be ready for issue by end of presentweek.    _800        750        750       750       750       1,260   5,000   251xx   14 sets are without collars.
There will be no difficulty in obtaining backhands, bridles, traces or ploughlines, and contracts for large supplies of these articles have been or are being placed, but considerable difficulty is being experienced in securing adequate supplies of collars, and to a less degree hames.     In the case of collars, the Far Office (Contracts-Branch) have approached all known manufacturers of collars and numerous harness contractors In the United Kingdom, as well as 800 brewers, the principal cartage contractors, (through their associations and individually) the Railway Companies, large dealers in secondhand harness and the various Master Saddlers Associations throughout the country.   The results, however, have been disappointing so far, though several hundred collars will probably be obtained from the Railway CompanieThe Treasury Solicitor has raised a technical objection to the issue by the Army Council of an order for requisitioning suitable collars, but an assurance having been ?iven by me that the supply Is necessary to ensure the carrying out of the Governments programme, it Is expected that the order will now come into effect.     This should secure that any available supplies which have not yet been drawn upon will become available for the Department.An order for 10,000 collars, hames and hame straps for delivery f.a.s. an Atlantic port not later than the 15th prox, has been sent to the United States.     Information as to the arrangements made should shortly be received.SUPPLIES.Supplies Sub-Committees.      Meetings were held last week at Birmingham and Shrewsbury, when the merchants of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire were addressed on the scheme of Approved Agents.     At   Shrewsbury fifteen merchants were enlisted, and will be storing about 300 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia.     The other counties are also organising on the same lines through theic Merchantfs Association.Sulphate of Ammonia.   The majority of the claims by makers on the-10-
Sulphate of Ammonia Fund for th&amp;   period from February to May have now been received and settled.     The total quantity involved is 29,196 tons, which represents about one-third of the deliveries for agricultural purposes, the remainder of the deliveries being made at the expense of the consumer.     The average cost of delivery has been 14/4 per ton, of which 10/- falls on the consumer, so that the net balance payable to makers is a little over  7,000.     The charges falling on the Fund up to the present are less than was anticipated.     The methods employed by the Department in pressing the sale of Sulphate are proving so successful, that it will be necessary to restrict export to colonies and allied countries within narrower limits than had been contemplated. Lano^D^aiiis.       The attention Of makers of drain pipes has been drawn to the possibility of an Increased demand, and enquiries have been made as to their stocks, prices and average weekly output. The stocks in hand are usually quite small, being in the majority of cases less than a week&apos;s output.     Many firms, however, seem to be in a position to turn out supplies if required, and it is only the absence of demand which prevents larger supplies being available. The extent to which draining will be carried out is very uncertain, and until evidence on this point is available, action in the direction of stimulating production will be deferred. Superphosphate.      An Order of the Ministry of Munitions fixing the maximum price of Superphosphate has now been issued, and the draft of the circular explaining the Order to farmers is being considered by the Phosphates and Potash Distribution Committee. Seed Wheat,      The stock of seed wheat of the 1916 crop still left is 3,897 quarters, and, in view of the unfavourable weather pre-vailing at present, it seems likely that the demand will considerably exceed this figure.     Enquiries are, therefore, being made as to the possibility of securing additional supplies, should they be needed.
The Selection Committee has now completed its inspection of the 1917 crop, and a number of requests have been received from growers for permission to thresh the wheat provisionally selected for purchase.   The Department are stipulating that where the grower obtains permission to thresh his wheat in the field, he shall accept the responsibility for Its being delivered in such condition that it will keep satisfactorily for at least a month after it is placed in store.   The weather during the past week has further reduced the prospects of the supply of seed of the selected varieties of the 1917 crop.Seeds (other than Cereals). The unfavourable weather has affected the- prospects of certain supplies of seedsj e.g. the English pea harvest has been seriously interfered with* and it is estimated that the yield will be small.   Reports regarding home-grown onion seed are not re-assuring.   Under these circumstances, it is of primary importance to secure the rapid transport of supplies from abroad and further steps are being taken to ensure this.The Department still receive a number of applications regarding the retention of skilled labour necessary for seed growing, seed cleaning and seed distribution.   The military representatives are now making every endeavour to rope in all Category A men for the Army, and it will be a serious thing if the few remaining experts in the seed trado are to be further reduced in number.   The effect of removing skilled labour will not be felt only in regard to supplies of seed required in the immediate future, but, unless a sufficient number of skilled men remain, it is very difficult to see how the seed houses are to maintain the purity and quality of their stocks.The enquiries which have been made confirm the view that in the interests of increased production it is essential that the seed trade should be permitted to retain a necessary minimum of skilled labour, and the Department have been careful to support
I \       -\,i -only such cases as they believe to fall under this Category.   It is most desirable that no action should be taken to prevent the retention of this essential minimum.Seed, Potatoes.   It is hoped that supplies of immune varieties of seed potatoes necessary for distribution in scheduled areas may be obtained (a) from Scotland, (b) from the Northern half of England and (c) from Ireland.   It is proposed to appoint a Committee of Inspection to view the crops and to make provisional arrangements for purchase.   The estimated total required by the Department for distribution is 10,000 tons.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E, Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
