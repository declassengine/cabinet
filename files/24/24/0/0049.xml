Translation. ITALIAN EMBASSY,August 14th, 1917.Ho:S6 4.Urgent (163939)Sir,As is doubtless known to Your Excellency the British Admiralty last year kindly undertook to endeavour to find the necessary means to transport from Archangel to the United Kingdom soldiers from the unredeemed provinces made prisoners by the Russians and subsequently set at liberty owing to their Italian nationality, aAs far bach as last June the Italian Government instructed this Embassy to ask again for one or more steamers to bring about 3,000 more of these men from Archangel and the necessary steps were taken at the Admiralty, as before, by the
Italian $aval Attache.     Count di Vallarey has however now informed me that the Admiralty have stated that they are not in a position to give a reply to this request as the alloca-tion of shipping has recently &quot;been banded over to the ?/ar Cabinet.       In addition to the Italians there is also a ^considerable number of Serbians to be conveyed to England.On the most urgent instructions from my Government I bavs&quot;the honour to request Your Excellency to be so good -jas &quot;to %raw the serious attention of the VTar Cabinet to the necessity,of reaching an early and favourable decision ;as regards the transport of these. Italianswho, so I am informed, have already- been collected and will be ready to 3-eave in a few daysrtime,     The Italian Government have already made arrangements&apos; for their transit across Prance.In the firm confidence that Your Excellency1s good offices will lead to compliance with the desire of my Government, and thanking you in advance.I have, etc.(signed)    Imperiali.The Sight Honourable, A, J.
