(This Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic -Majesty.&apos;s Government! OperationsyyrOmt&quot;    General Barter, Moscow^ Russia, To:-        C.I.G.Sj- War Office.29th August 1917. 4.10 p*m*ITo. 104 M.Early this morning Conference closed.        Impressive speech by Alexieff narked the last session.     That the speeches Of Aloxieff and Xorniloff have undoubtedly had excellent effect is shown by the expressed determination of the speakers of all political parties yesterday to carry on the war to a successful and honourable conclusion with an unfailing energy.     In a fine speech Kerenski opened the road to conciliation and united effort.     His presidency of this Conference has been impartial and distinguished, and on a level with the best parliamentary traditions.     He did not once allow any speaker&apos;, whether a friend or opponent, to attribute to another party unworthy motives.     He said that although the representatives of the different parties present might differ in their views.they were all honest in their&apos;desire to do what was best for Russia.     By this impartial and moderate attitude and by his last speech the unfavourable impression created by his first speech has undoubtedly been corrected, and his position been strengthened.     Much good, he said, had resulted from Conference: the Government had learnt the exact views of all factions and the different parties had gained the opportunity of-forming a less unfavourable opinion of each other; he thought there was a much better chance now of unity for the common good.       The idealistic tendencies of which he had been accused would now be put away,       1 think if the Governmentimmediately
EImmediately start reorganising thoroughly regardless of opposition of the extreme left it will occupy very strong position.     My own opinion of Kerenski as a statesman has risen considerably.     He certainly is a leader of great personal magnetism and quick resource.     Prom the point of view of allies the main result of this Conference is the now clear and unanimous expression of intention of leaders of all parties to continue war with determination and energy. Whilst some disposition to compromise with the Government in order to get reorganization started was shown by the moderate party headed by. Kodzianko   an at tempt at counter-revolution will, I believe., shortly be made by military party and the Government-are preparing for it,     I had an interview with Alexieff   after his speeck.     He said that time was not yet ripe for action by foree.     I believe he himself is against any commotion at present moment if the Government will only att, but I believe Korniloff on the other hand considers that in any case such action is  indispensable.     I have been informed on sound authority that Alexieff has refused offer of fresh appointment of Commander-in-Chlef,Today I am returning to G.H.Q.
