ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH. 20th August, 1917.Sir,INCREASED POOD PRODUCTION. The question haB arisen in some districts as to the position that should be taken up when, in the Judgment of a Committee, more land should be ploughed by a farmer in the last year of his lease than he is entitled to do by the terms of that lease.     The Board do not consider that the termB of the lease should preclude the possibility of the Committee^ views being met, but the question arises whether it would be fair to all parties that the outgoing tenant should be allowed to plough more widely than his lease con-&apos; templates without some consideration being given to the rights of the landlord or the incoming tenant.   Where possible, Committees should encourage outgoing tenants to make amicable and equitable arrangements with their proprietors, and it appears to the Board that the interests of all parties might be conserved either by:-(1) An agreement between the parties that the out-going tenant should be paid for the seed and labour expended in laying down the crop and receive an allowance for the loss of pasture from the date of ploughing to the end of the tenancy, and the incoming tenant should get the crop on making these paymentsj or(2) The parties should arrange between themselves that a certain sum should be paid by the outgoing tenant to his proprietor for the privilege of having an additional way-going crop on the acreage whloh the Committee desires ploughed.In /, Secretary, District AgriculturalExecutive Committee,
In determining what would be a reasonable payment regard would be had to the faot that the outgoing tenant was, so far as the land In question was concerned, reaping the crop of an additional year beyond what was contemplated in his lease.The foregoing suggestions are made on the assumption that an arrangement mutually satisfactory to all parties can be arrived at.     In certain cases It nay be necessary for the Board to consider whether on the recommendation of the Executive Committee they should issue a compulsory order requiring the outgoing tenant to plough a larger area than was authorised by his lease.     Generally speaking, the Board would have some difficulty in issuing such an order unless they were assured that the rights of all parties were duly conserved.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.

MEMORANDUMv    TODISTRICT AGRICULTURAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES v.: - ;?:IN SCOTLAND.1. It lias been agreed that no men who were on the 1st of June 1917, and are still employed whole time on a farm on farm work of national importance, shall be posted for service with the Colours, or called up for medical examination or re-examination, except with the consent of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, even though a sub-stitute may have been provided or offered. ,This arrangement is referred to in this Memorandum as the &quot;Agreement.&quot; The description &quot;employed whole-time on a farm on farm work&quot; covers men employed in agriculture as Thatchers, Drivers of Engines or Motor Tractors (including Tractor Ploughmen), and Market. Gardeners whole-time employed in producing food of a character and amount to constitute national importance. The description does not include work on a poultry farm or a market garden for the . production of flowers or of fruit.PROCEDURE AS REGARDS A MAN WHOSE CASE HAS BEEN FINALLY DISPOSED OF BY THE TRIBUNALS.- 2. If the Recruiting Officer knows that the man falls within the Agreement, and that the Board would not consent to his being called up, no action will be taken by the Recruiting. Officer, and the man will be allowed to remain in his civil occupation.3. .If the Recruiting Officer is in doubt, he will send the man a calling-up Notice, attached to which will be Army Form W. 3618, on which the man can claim that he comes within the Agreement, and which he will complete and return to the Recruiting Officer. If the Recruiting Officer from his own knowledge is satisfied of the accuracy of the claim on the particulars furnished, he will cancel the calling-up Notice. If he is not satisfied, he will refer the case to the Board, sending Army Form W. 3618 for the claim to be verified; The Board propose to remit these claims to the District Agricultural Committees for report, and will, if clearly satisfied that the man is engaged whole-time on a farm on farm work, and that his work is of national importance, and that he was already engaged .on such work on the 1st of June 1917, complete and send to the Recruiting Officer &quot;the Voucher A. on Army Form W. 3618 to that effect. On receipt of this Voucher confirming the claim, the Recruiting Officer will cancel the calling-up Notice. If, however, the Board are not satisfied that the claim is warranted (see paragraph 10 of this Memorandum) they will complete and send to the Recruiting Officer the Voucher B. on Army Form W. 3618. In either case they will strike out the Voucher A. or B. which is inappropriate.PROCEDURE AS REGARDS CALLING UP OF MEN FOR MEDICAL EXAMINATION OR RE-EXAMINATION.4. Procedure similar to that outlined in the foregoing paragraph will be followed in the case of a man who, being engaged whole-time on a farm on farm work of national im-portance, is called up for medical examination or re-examination.CASES IN WHICH THE CALLING-UP NOTICE MAY BE ENFORCED.5. It is essential that the Executive Committee should deal with cases with the least possible delay. If the Recruiting Officer has not received a voucher confirming the man&apos;s claim within three weeks from the date onM &amp; G Ltd  Wt 2559/78 8-17 1000 G. 2
which the Army Form W. 3618 is sent to the Board by the Recruiting Officer, or if the Board do not confirm the man&apos;s claim, his Calling-up Notice will be enforced. In the case, however, of men employed in Orkney, Shetland, or the Hebrides, the period will be^four weeks instead of three weeks.PROCEDURE IN THE CASE OF MEN WHO HOLD TEMPORARY CERTIFI-CATES OF EXEMPTION, OR WHO HAVE NOT YET MADE APPLICATION TO THE.TRIBUNALS.6. Atliougli men covered by the Agreement will not be liable to be posted&apos; for service with the Colours, even if they do not apply for certificates of exemption, or for renewal of existing certificates, yet it is very desirable in their own interests that such men should make full use of their statutory and other rights by applying to the Tribunals for formal certificates of exemption or for renewals thereof. In this connec-tion, it is necessary to emphasise the fact that there is no provision enabling a Tribunal to hear an application made out of date for the renewal of a certificate of exemption. Application may be made by or on behalf of a man who has attained the age of 18 on any day before the appointed date under the Military Service Acts, i.e. before the 30th day after he attains that age. Application for the renewal of a certificate may be made before or within two weeks after the date on which the certificate ceases to be in force if the man is unattestcd, and before the date on which the certificate ceases to be in force, or not later than seven days after individual notice has been sent to the man calling him up for Service, if he is attested. A copy of. a Memorandum (It, 144 (Sc.)) issued by the Scottish Office to Tribunals is enclosed.GENERAL.7. If the Recruiting Officer objects in any individual case to the decision of the Board, he will send particulars to the War Office, who will take the matter up with the Board.8. If a man engaged&apos; whole-time on a particular farm on farm work, changes his place of employment, the previous Voucher issued by the Board will cease to be of effect, but they may issue a Voucher for his new employment if this is warranted.9. As a general rule it will not be necessary for the Board to ask for inquiry into the case of an individual man with a view to the issue of a Voucher except (a)&apos;Where the Recruiting Officer refers the case to the Board (see paragraph &apos;J of this Memorandum).(b) Where the case is referred to the Board as a result of an application to a Tribunal for a certificate of exemption or the renewal of a certificate of exemption.10. The effect of the Agreement is that no man whole-time employed on a farm on farm work can be removed from his civil occupation without the consent of the Board. It will, however, be the &quot;duty of the Board to notify the Military Authorities that.a particular man is not entitled to the benefit of the Agreement in the following circumstances: (1) If the Board are satisfied that the mans work is not of national importance ; (2) Where the man is employed on a farm on which there is an excess of labour.Secretary.Board of Agriculture for Scotland, Edinburgh, 9th August 1917.

ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH,August 1917.hclosure.Sir,EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN FORESTRY.I am directed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to enclose herewith a copy of Form N.S.V.W.8.I. relating to the training and employment of women in agriculture, and to inform you that the scheme, the details of which are set forth in the form, is now being extended so as to include a limited number of women to be engaged in forestry work. The terms as to training, wages, equipment, unemployment, etc., will be the same for forestry as for agriculture.For the purpose of enabling women to receive a rather more varied and extensive training in forestry work, it is suggested that it might be convenient to restrict the maintenance grant in respect of any one branch of seasonal work on which they are immediately thereafter to be employed to, say, one week, and subsequently to give a further week&apos;s maintenance when they begin to be employed in each of other two branches of forestry work appropriate to other seasons. In no case, however, can the allowance made to a woman during training be for a greater total period than three weeks.As one or two training centres have already been instituted, it will be possible to supply a limited number of trained women for immediate employment by forest owners who are not in a position to undertake the training of women for the period or periods stated above. On the other hand, training centres may be established in forest areas the owners of which do not desire to employ the women when trained, but are willing that courses of training should be given on their estates. Where necessary in such cases, efforts will be made to arrange for gang leaders or forewomen accompanying the trainees.- The scheme is a war emergency measure, and the Board trust that all owners will consider the extent to which the scheme can be made use of in connection with work in their forests with a view to maintaining the progress of this work of national importance by the employment of such National Service women volunteers as may be passed by a selection committee as fit for the work in so far as it is due to lack of labour.Forest owners or others who desire to employ women for forestry work under this scheme, or who are willing that training centres should be established on their estates, should communicate either with this Board or with the Agricultural Organiser (Womens Section), Ministry of Labour, 44 Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh, who will gladly give further particulars and any assistance possible in connection with the scheme.I am,Your obedient Servant,Secretary.M &amp; G Ltd Wt 2703/86 8-17 5C0 a 2
