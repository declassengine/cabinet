Begins(1)   I am exceedingly glad that -I and my troops have been ordered, in co-operation with your troops, to assume the offensive in the direction of Mosul.(2)   General Prince Vadbolski will command the main force detailed for this offensive, which will be , able to commence the offensive not earlier than the end of October (about October 31st),   The commencement of the offensive depends on the preparation of the rear which cannot be completed at an earlier date.   Winter conditions in the mountains have been well considered.(3)   I consider that the advance to the Dialha of the force detailed for transfer to your command would . be premature at present, since, before operations began, the force would melt away, owing to the trying climatic conditions of summer in the Dialha area.     The advance of this force cannot commence earlier than the middle of October (about October 15th).General Prjevalski.
