&quot;ffifl&amp;iment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government]^momA3Vrinted for the.War Cabinet.   August 1917. .SECRET.99NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION, 13.Week ending August 1^-20.Submarine Attack on Trade.THE week &apos; 14th to 20th August has been one of considerable general activity. On the 19th August about thirty-two enemy submarines are believed to have been operating : their distribution being as follows : North Sea   ... English Channel Approach    routes English Channel9 4toAtlantic Mediterranean White Sea...10. 7 0Of these ten or eleven large submarines have been operating to the northward and westward of the British Islands. Remarkably few reports of submarine activity have come in from the approach route to the south-west of Ireland a favourite hunting ground : hut this may be accounted for by the fact that little traffic has been using this route. Two or three boats have been working in the English Channel approaches, and activity here and off Ushant has been marked.In the North Sea the Lerwick-Scandinavia convoy has been attacked on two or three occasions, and it looks as if one or possibly two boats have been detailed for work against this convoy.A boat probably a new-comer is again reported as working north of the Azores.Appendix I shows the numbers and tonnage of sailings and losses by submarine and mine of British merchant steamships working to and from the United Kingdom for the week ending 18th August. For this period the total number of tons sunk is 58,515 : the percentage sunk of the total tonnage that sailed is 2 &quot;08. This weeks figures show an increase on last week in the numbers and tonnage of British ships sunk: hut a considerable decrease in Allied and neutrals.The following table shows, by routes, percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine and mine for the last four weeks.Percentage of Tonnage Sunk by Submarine and Mine.Koutes^-To and From the United Kingdom.Month of April.Month of May.Week ending-July 27.August 4.August 11.August 18.All routes, exclusive of Gross- f Channel .. \Selected routes  .,.

2This week&apos;s figures suggest that the submarines are again concentrating theirattention on the outward rather than the inward sailings-a reversal of last week&apos;sprocedure.   The percentage of ships sunk in convoy remains small and constant, butit is not to be expected that the present comparative success of the convoy will bemaintained as the system becomes more fully understood by the enemy.The total and casualty figures for convoyed ships are as shown in the following return : Convoy.

One outward convoy of nine Brazilian ships was escorted clear of danger zone and was reportedsafe.Enemy submarines are reported to have been engaged by His Majesty&apos;s ships on fifteen occasions this week two by destroyers, three by special service ships, six by auxiliary patrol craft, two by submarines, and two by seaplanes.On one of these occasions it is known that the submarine was destroyed; on two occasions destruction is probable. It is now known that the destroyer &quot; Oracle&apos;s &quot; claim to have sunk a submarine last week by ramming was justified by the fact.An estimate of the British tonnage sunk per month per enemy submarine available, on the best information obtainable, is as follows : Average for  Tons.1916        .. ,9 *f ta ., .. 94     6751917-January..

July:     .. ; :      .,808 2,257 2,281 3,406 1,938 2,699 2,458This increase is partly due to the increased effectiveness of the destructive power of the submarines out and partly to an increase in the effective operating time of the submarines in commission by 33 per cent, on last year&apos;s average.During the week ended the 11th August 33 additional vessels were equipped for defensive armament and 5 fitted for carrying a larger gun than they could before. The total number of vessels fitted at the end of this week was 3,744. The nett increase in the number of guns available for merchant vessels was 43-the largest nett increase since the week ending the 23rd June. The losses and withdrawals during the week were only 13 as compared with 31 for the previous week. The detailed figures for defensive armament on the 11th August were as follows : \

Harwich area. Thames Estuary. Tiree.The absence of mines in Dover area (excluding north coast of France) and south coast of England generally has been very marked of late. This may be due to our new barrage quite recently laid off Ostend. The west coast of Scotland from. Lewis to Dubhartaeh is not yet clear of mines, but traffic routes are free. Small groups of three to four mines each were laid in six different localities separated by a distance of 80 miles, but with the single exception of Ardamurchan Point the present traffic route was left free, although the old route was heavily mined.Naval Construction.The following statement shows the number of warships and auxiliary vessels completed during the week ending the 18th August: . :   t.b.Ds...     ; ..3; ...&quot; ,. ;\:/;.&apos;.-;:: y&amp;yi-l^, --^$X-Trawlers ..        ..        .. ..        ..        .. 2Patrol boatT.S.M.S.  &apos; &apos; -  .. .: -        .. . &apos; .1 -     ...... 1\  &quot;&apos; &apos; . &apos;; Total ..       ...     ..... .7 -  .   /,   .The total number of vessels now under construction amounts to 924.Merchant Shipbuilding.During the week ending the 17th August three vessels have been reported as completed, having a gross tonnage of 15,730. This brings the total completions for the month of August up to five vessels of 29,898 gross tons. As half the month is now past, the completions have considerable leeway to make up before the forecast of 125,000 gross tons for the month is realised.Two vessels are reported launched during the week; but it is understood that considerable improvement in the number of launches may be looked for during the remainder of the current month.
4The vessels reported laid down have increased by thirteen, but certain vessels laid down in July, not previously reported, are included. Every effort is made to secure prompt returns, and considerable improvement is experienced in this respect.The following table gives the position of Merchant Shipbuilding on the 17th instant as compared with the previous week: 	Week ending          Week ending-August 10.

The vessel (&quot; A &quot; type) is named the &quot; War Admiral,&quot; and has been bnilt by Messrs. Harland and Wolff.   The second standard vessel has been launched during the week.That the twenty-four Standard &quot; D &quot; type vessels to be built as &quot; Q&apos;s &quot; will not now be required as directions have been given for the construction of twenty-four sloops in their place.Shipbuilding in the U.S.A.Information has been received as to the shipbuilding completed in the U.S.A. during the two years ending the 30th June, 1916 and the 30th June, 1917. The gross tonnage built has increased from 350,000 tons to 818,000 tons, the bulk of the increase being in steel vessels.Minor Operations.Two new minefields have been laid in the North Sea. In each case the minelayers were accompanied by light cruisers and destroyers. On the day after each operation the light cruisers and destroyers carried out sweeps to search for minesweepers or outpost boats. During one of these, the Harwich force engaged and chased a destroyer and some minesweepers, but owing to the low visability and the close proximity of minefields, the chase had to be abandoned, but not before severe damage had been inflicted on several of the enemy vessels.A detached force captured the Dutch steamship &quot; Leonora&quot; carrying coal for Germany.R.N.A.S. squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out many bombing raid,3, in which Varssonaere, Thourout, Snelleghem, and Ghistelles aerodromes, Bruges docks, and Ostend, Ghent and Thourout railway centres have been attacked.R.N.A.S. patrols from Dunkirk have brought down an enemy seaplane and have driven down two 2-seater enemy machines.Bombing raids have been carried out by the R.N.A.S. in the Eastern Mediterranean on Drama and Gereviz aerodromes (Bulgaria), Hala Bourun railway works (near Smyrna), and Messrs. Rice&apos;s works at Smyrna.Situation in Mediterranean.: ,The whole naval situation in the Mediterranean has been reviewed, and with the object of centralising the control of all routes in that area, Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe has been appointed as Commander-in-Chief of all British naval forces-
-in the Mediterranean, where he will also be in charge of all Allied patrols and escorts. His flag will he flown at Malta. rA memorandum on this subject has been circulated to the War Cabinet and is printed as an Appendix II.Movements of German Merchant-ships.

APPENDIX IT.Situation in the Mediterranean.Vice-Adiniral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe is now proceeding to take up his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of all British naval forces in the Mediterranean, his Hag being flown ashore at Malta. He will be in charge of all A Hied patrols and escorts in the &quot;Mediterranean, with French and Italian flag officers working with Kear-Admiral Fergusson, on his staff, and will issue orders as to the routes and control of mercantile traffic. He will also direct the anti-submarine operations within the Mediterranean command of the British and French naval forces. At present he will not direct the anti-submarine operations of the Italian naval forces.The working of these patrols and escorts will be subject to the general authority of the French:&quot; Commander-in-Chief in case it becomes necessary to withdraw small craft from these duties to. work with the fleet for offensive operations, or for the protection of the fleet. &apos;Pear-Admiral Freemantle will be in command of the British Squadron in the iSgean.Kear-Admiral Jackson is Senior Naval Officer Egypt and Red Sea, under the orders of the British Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.The limits&apos;.of the Mediterranean station have again been extended so as to include the whole of the Red Sea and also Gibraltar, and as far west as the meridian of Cape St. Vincent.The number of Japanese destroyers in the Mediterranean has just been increased from 8 to 12, and the 6 Australian destroyers are now stationed in the Mediterranean. This brings the total number of British destroyers in the Mediterranean up to 45, including 2 now based on Gibraltar. As soon as they can be spared, 2 more destroyers will be sent out from England, making a total of A7 British destroyers, and 12 Japanese destroyers. Of these 12 are required to maintain the patrol off the Dardanelles. The remainder will all be employed on convoy and escort work, and in offensive action against submarines.Beyond the escort, convoy, and anti-submarine work, the principal duties of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean are at present: Adriatic-Co-operation with the Italian army towards Trieste. Protection of the Otranto Barrage in conjunction with the Italian Fleet.TEgean.-Blockade of Bulgaria, Turkey, and Asia Minor coasts.Prevention of raids by enemy destroyers or other vessels from tire Sea of Marmora.Co-operation of the army on the Struma front.Protection oE the minefields off the Dardanelles.Keeping.down fire of enemy guns on the Gallipoli Peninsula firing on Imbros and Mavro, and enemy guns on Asia Minor coast firing on Mavro and Tenedos.-Keeping down fire of enemy guns in Asia Minor between Gulf of Adramyti and Cape Alupo (opposite Rhodes).Offensive operations by aircraft.Syria.-Offensive operations by aircraft.Operations against the Syrian coast and railways are in contemplation, in con-junction with the army under General Allenby in Southern Palestine.The new&apos;system of sending troops overland to Taranto, and thence in small troop carriers through the danger zone is now coming into operation.Good results are expected from placing the general control of all Allied patrols and escorts under a British Admiral, who will at Malta be centrally situated for con-trolling all the Mediterranean routes.Present Distribution of Allied Fleets in Mediterranean.British Fleet-Principally stationed in the JEgean, with Mudros as the main base, their functions being to engage the Turkish Fleet should it come out of the Dardanelles. A light cruiser squadron and three submarines are based on Brindisi, acting under the orders of the Italian Commander-in-Chief, also a large number of drifters for the Otranto Barrage.; Two monitors with 12-inch guns based on Venice for work in&apos; conjunction with Italian navy, in support of the army.A British aerial force is based on Otranto under the immediate orders of a British Commodore.   This force at present consists of 15 seaplanes and 6 aeroplanes.   They
o-carry out work in connection with the Otranto Barrage in conjunction with the Italians, and, when sufficient machines are available, attacks on enemy bases are contemplated, also in conjunction with the Italians. This force has also a base at Taranto, where facilities are greater for erecting machines, practice flights, &amp;c.Three small monitors based on Port Said for the defence of Egypt and for operations against the coast of Syria. Destroyers, sloops, and other small craft are also based on Alexandria, Suda, Malta, and Gibraltar, and are employed on escort duties and patrol work and submarine hunting.Japanese Flotilla of 12 Destroyers, under Rear-Admiral Sato, based on Malta and employed on escort duties. This squadron is not formally placed under the orders of &apos; Commander-iii-Chief, but is directed to carry out operations in consultation with British Senior Naval Officers, or at their request.French Fleet. Corfu is the principal base of the;fleet, but ships are stationed at Salamis, Mudros, and Salonica, and a small squadron (Syrian division) is based on - Port Said. Certain destroyers and submarines are based on Brindisi for work with the Italian Fleet. Destroyers for escort and patrolling work are also based on Milo, Toulon, Bona, and Argostoli.Italian Fleet. Taranto is the main base of the Italian battle fleet, but cruisers, light cruisers, and torpedo-craft are based on Brindisi. -There is also a battle squadron and a considerable number of torpedo-craft at Venice, and a base for torpedo-craft at Valona. There are also anti-submarine flotillas at various places on west coast of Italy, such as Genoa, Spezzia, Leghorn, Naples, &amp;c.Arrangements for Co-operation between Allied Fleets in Mediterranean.The principal enemy naval force in the Mediterranean is the Austrian fleet. , Should the Austrian fleet put to sea, the Italian Commander-in-Chief is responsible for engaging it in the Adriatic, with the assistance of a French squadron from Corfu, who will he under his. orders. In the event of the French Commander-in-Chief and the greater part of ..the French fleet being required to assist the Italian fleet inside the Adriatic against the Austrian fleet, the command of the Allied fleets is vested in the French Commander-in-Chief. Outside the Adriatic, if the Austrian fleet breaks out or for any other major operations, the French Commander-in-Chief is in command of all the Allied fleets.The British squadron in the iEgean is responsible for the operations off the Dardanelles. Should the Turkish fleet come out, the British squadron, -with the assistance of the French squadron in the iEgean, would engage them. For practical purposes, outside the Dardanelles the Turkish fleet may be considered as consisting only of &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; and a small number of torpedo-craft. There is always the chance that these ships may attempt a raiding attack on Imbros, Lemnos Staravos, or Salonica. The British Rear-Admiral carried out minor operations in the iEgean at his discretion, keeping the French Commander-in-Chief informed of what he does.In the improbable event of the Austrian fleet getting past the French and Italian ileets and making for the Dardanelles it is the duty of the British iEgean squadron, supported by the French iEgean squadron, to hold them before they can reach their objective until the main Allied fleet under the French Commander-in-Chief can come up and.deal with them.A British officer is in,command of the Otranto Barrage under the orders of the Italian Commander-in-Chief.Minor operations on the Syrian coast in support, of the British army are carried put by the British squadron based on Egypt, the French Syrian division co-operating.August 15, 1917.
