S E C H B TVG.T.1823. WAR CABINET.BRITISH MILITARY EFFORTS IN THE WAR.    NECESSITY FOR INCREASED PUBLICITY III AMERICA.Minute by Lord Milner.I am anxious to draw the attention of my colleagues to the attached copy of a.cable which I have received from Dr.Parkin. Dr.Parkin is Secretary to the Rhodes Trust, and has been travell-ing in all parts of the United States for some months past :in connection with his work in this -capacity.    ,Ee has frequently been on similar missions before and ia very familiar with the United States and Canada.     In my opinion his evidence is of very special value, and it serves to confirm the reports which -have reached us from Lord Northcliffe and others.(Intd.)    Mo2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,  3rd August, 1917,Copy of Cablegram received from Dr.Parkin, 28nd.Aug.1917.My observation in much recent travelling through the U.3.A. convinces me more than ever that great harm is being done to British cause by insufficient reports of our English efforts and losses.     The result here is that the public is convinced that the German statement that Canadians, Australians and French do nearly all the fighting is true.     The people here are greatly surprised when I tell them of our losses.     The names of British regiments are rarely given here and the constant publication of the names of French flying men gives the impression that all flying is being done by Prance.     This situation is being made much of by our hostile critics.&apos;.   A change of policy. in this connection would improve the situation and strengthen the hands of the President In regard to British affairs.&apos;I am sending this message for the^information^of the. Cabinet after consultation with English and&quot;&quot;Canadian&quot;friends. The&quot;result of the present method is harmful and the position in my opinion is serious.
