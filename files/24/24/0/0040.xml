,7 COPY OP-CTSGIIAM-&apos; FROM-&apos;- COLOHEL BYRKE, PETROGRAD..-  -ADDRESSED,; TO..TEE GCI/i/ITTLI; 0*. rtUSSIAJi. SUiILIIo,p. 435. August 11th.. Received 10.a.m.. 16/8/17, Reference your T., 27.6..Coal.   The/Russian Government agree to accept 215%- Korth country coal of total tonnage remaining tc &quot;be shipped this year..   But as supplies of    elsh coal received to date are insufficient for needs of the fleet,  present order of priority is given as follows;- -(1)   Coke,(2)    Smith Coal.(3)   Welsh Coal.( 4)   ITorth Country Co8.1.. Yesterday, MICIIB/LSO];; at a meeting oC the Committee on Foreign Supplies again appealed for full supply of their reduced requirements viz., 1,259,000 tons.   Personally I am of opinion that every effort should he made to send as much coal to Russia as possible.   Failure of railway transport is preventing supplies reaching Petrograd from the V. and if our .redueed-programme is adhered to there will he a;serious shortage during the winter.    The effect of this on civil population apart from military, considerations might well prove disastrous. Spare Tonnage..  Information given is not sufficient to enable me to express opinion as the -impression here was that more cargo than tonnage was available in U.k.    General KICIISLSOH has prepared priority statement for august which has&apos; been cabled to General liSHuONiyS. -  I agree generally with order of priority-given apart from (l group undecipherable)and (l group undeciy-her-s-blo),if tonnage is available after complying:as far as practicr-able with this statement-,  preference should be given to ( ?) DE2JCEmaterial which is urgently required.    Statements &quot; ^ro too long to cable and copies are being brought by LEAKS.
