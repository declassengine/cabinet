f -. n- \   %Win       IfrM  J^l^rp^lu0^ TRIBUNALS ASP MEDICAL BOARDS.- I have just seen the Memorandum dated. 16th August by Sir Auckland Geddeson &quot;National Service. Department and Recruiting. *So far as;the. remarks in- that Memorandum are intended to apply to Tribunals:and Medical Boards I feel it right to aay that I entirely disagree with them.I. speak from, absolute knowledge wheii I. say that.no avoidable, difficulties have in the past/resulted from the &apos; supervision- of the; Tribunals being in- the .hands of: the Local Government Board, neither has : there, been any lack of co-ordination due to that Department.Assuming-that Tribunals constituted under - the Military Service * Act are to: oe -continued, they must remain under an impartial Department if the applicants are.to be ensured a fair hearing!:     Public opinion-would not tolerate the - transfer of this work, to a Department which ..-uat be mainly concerned with the utilisation of &amp;an. power, for. military purposes.    &apos; Personally, I believe,that we could never- have carried.compulsory service if it had not bean for the sense of seourity afforded.by the setting up of the Tribunals under a Department directly oon-nected with Local Government. ;For similar reasons, as I pointed out in my memorandum of 14th August, I am cbhvinced;fro^ -experience ttat the proper step-would be to place the Medical Boards also under the Local Government Board.So far frostf injuring the prospects of the National Service- $apartment,.;my feeling is - that :ths change I suggest would appeal to public confidence and would place the.new Department on a much ourer foundation than -.the - old &quot;Recruiting branch ever-was.-I understand however that soine arrangement has been come to between the National Service,Department and the Local Government Board under which (l) Tribunals are to r,main under the latl-er Department;   and (3) an appeal to an Appeal Tribunal is to be allowed against the decision of the Medical Boards. The -second point is undoubtedly an improvement on present conditions..:In spite of this agreement, I think .it my duty to record my otiong feeling on the general-question.Colonial Office,33rd August, 1317.
