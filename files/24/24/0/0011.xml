SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. DGW/010.WEEKLY REPORT ON GREECE. X. (22 August, 1917).The Meeting of the Chamber.Further information to hand, especially from the Greek press, elucidates certain facts ac to what took place at the meeting of the Chamber.    At the first meeting at which there was a quorum (on August 1) the Venizelist candidate for the presidency of the Chamber, Mr Sophoulis, was, as has already been stated, elected by 180 votes to 12.     It now appears that only 13 non-Venizelist members wore present, including the Independent Mr Pop, Messrs Basias and Karapanos (the latter of whom was Minister of Foreign Affairs in Mr Kaloyeropoulos&apos; Government last year), and two Socialists, Kouricl and Sidheris. Kouriel, on behalf of the tiny Socialist Party, proposed the election of his colleague Sidheris, accompanying the proposal with a protest against the continuance of a &quot;bastard regime ofimonarchical democracy&quot; and demanding that the future constitution of Greece should depend on the people&apos;s will.     He only secured two votes for his proposal.English press reports of the Speech from the Throne curiously enough omit one of the most important sentences. At the end of the second paragraph, as reported in the English press, come the words:     &quot;We have repealed the decree which, by a violation of the Constitution, dissolved the Chamber, and have convoked this Chamber for its regular second session&quot;.IIThese words are followed in the original by the important jaddition:   &quot;in order that there should succeed it before longI
the convocation of the Revisionist Assembly&quot;.     It is to this last promise that the Groek press pays particular attention, and Nea Ellas, one of the most extreme and influential of the Venizelist papers, makes two points with regard to the King&apos;s Speeoh.(1) That the decision whether or no the Monarchy is to be continued is not to be left to the Assembly, the duties of which are declared to be &quot;to revise the Constitution founded on the people&apos;s sovereignty and to   consolidate it and with it the Throne&quot;.      Nea Ellas adds that if the Monarchy is to be kept, while of course its powers will be strongly and specifically limited in future, greater attention must be paid to the removal of all the bad influences which,under Csnstantine&apos;s regime brought the country to ruin.     It mournfully admits that no legal restrictions can prevent the growth of autocracy, but hopes that the Greek democracy is now educated and watchful enough to guard agai nst a repetition of Constantine1s conspiracy against democracy.(2) The second and more important point is the fact that the new Assembly is to be not a Constituent (Sindaktiki) but a Revisionist (Anatheoritiki) one.     That is to say that the Constitution is not to be thrown into the melting-pot, but is merely to be revised with the object of limiting the powers of the Monarch on points on which he was only restrained vaguely and by convention.   It may be added that this, character which is te be given to the Assembly is very typical jo  Venizelos1 policy as a whole.     It will be remembered that in 1910 when he was invited to Greece to save the country from the chaos into which it had fallen, Venizelos, in spite of ...an -overwhelming popular demand for a Constituent Assembly,
3.firmly announced and persisted in his intention of merely summoning a Revisionist one.The New White Book.On August 18 a White Book was laid before the Chamber containing 77 documents dealing with the ambiguous and treacherous attitude of King Constantino and the successive anti-Venizellst Governments.     As the book itself has not yet come to hand and we   are dependent merely on telegraphic resumes of the more important documents, a detailed consideration of it must be postponed.     Supposing that the accounts wired are aocurate, the White Book gives even stronger proof of the prp-German attitude of the ex-King than hitherto existed. For instance, antl-Venizelists in their attempts to conciliate the Entente Powers were always eager to point out that King Constantine himself had at once rejected the German Emperor^ invitation to co-operate with him and had thereby proved hia perfect neutrality and friendliness towards the Entente.     The new documents published show that even from August 1914 King Constantine was working in the German interests.Ab to the proofs of the Skouloudhis Government1s complicity in tho occupation of Port Rupel there is little freah information, for most of the documents had already appeared nearly a year ago in the Patris.The Greco-Serbian treaty of alliance is also published In the White Book.Qreoo-Italian Relations.Attention may be called to a leading article in Nea Ellas headed &quot;The significance of the Greco-Italian Rapprochement&quot;.
The article deals with the question of Greco-Italian relations and especially with the future of Northern Epirus.    While it insists on the Greek character of Northern Epirus and the*Dodekaneee and Greece&apos;s racial claims to them, it pleads very strongly for a friendly understanding with Italy. It expresses its satisfaction with the decision of the Paris Conference that Epirus (except for the triangle of land in Poghoniani) is to he evacuated by the Italian troops.      The writer does not know whether to put this down to the good effices ef the British and French Governments or to a more conciliatory attitude on tho part of Italy or, in part, of both. It hopes that the future of Northern Epirus will be definitely decided by the Pe&amp;co Conference and that Greece&apos;s claims will not then be overlooked.     The article is typical of the best VcniBelist writing on the subject of Greco-Italian relations and well follows up tho two interviews in the Italian press by Mr Vonizelos himself and Mr Kikhalakopoulos, which have been referred to in Weekly Report No. 8.Unfortunately the proposed evacuation of Epirus by the Italian troops does not appear to have yet taken place,22.8.17.
