SEC R B. T.&amp;rT.183Sv WAR CABINET.COffSCIEKTIOUS OBJECTORS. (-Memorandum by Lord Milner)- I trust my colleagues will give careful consideration to the points raised in the memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for War on.the subject of Conscientious Objectors (Paper G.T.1799).It will be within their recollection that I raised this question myself on a previous occasion,, and that it was then decided that no case.for inquiry had been established (see.Paper G.T.677 and War&apos; Cabinet Ho.148, Minute 14).     I now note that it is the. opinion of the military authorities that &quot;many hundreds of men&quot; have been forced into the Array through the ineptitude&apos;   . of the tribunals who should have been clearly given exemption by the tribunals when acting in their statutory authority.&quot; This merely confirms the view, to which I gave expression,previous^ ly, that the plain intention of Parliament and of the Government -of the day as expressed in the Military Service Acts has been frustrated by the action of the tribunals.Since I. last raised this question a case has been brought to my notice Which emphasises the necessity of dealing with it. I refer to the case Of Mr.Malcolm Sparkes..    Mr.Sparkes has been, a life-long member of the Society of Friends.     On July 13th,/1916, the Slough Tribunal: decided that he should be exempted from milif tary service on cond.ition that he undertook some work of national importancej which was to be recommended by the Pelham Committee. With this decision.he complied,.    The work recommended by the Pelham Committee was the undertaking of work in connection with the establishment of industrial Parliaments in all our staple industries.     On this recommendation being reported to the Tribunal they stated that the work in;question was not of national importance h altered their previous decision, and, placed him in the lion-Combatant Corps of the Army,, without giving, him any possibility of sppeal. On November 3rd, 1916, the military representative appealed to nave his , exemption from Combatant Service withdrawn.;    The local tribunal upheld their decision, whereupon the military1 representative appeal-ed to the Appeal Tribunal, which upheld his appeal iHoy.lpth.,1916);.. Mr. Sparkes was thereupon called to: the colours, and, on-refusing to obey the summons, was sentenced on February 7th, 1917 h by Court Martial is 1 year 11 months imprisonment, with hard labour.    At the time,of his. arrest I understand that he was engaged in an.. &apos; important piece of work,, which he had undertaken at the request&apos; of the Chairman, of the Reconstruetion Committee on the relations between Employers and Employed.It is apparently now admitted on all sides that the action of the tribunals in this and similar cases is quite indefensible&quot; on any,prinoiple of equity, and that it has, in; fact, resulted In reversing the whole policy designed by the. Government to meet cases of this. kind.     That being so,&quot; I&apos; submit there is a strong.case for inquiry as to what action should be taken to clear up. a situation, which-it is quite impossible, to defend.. . I note that the Secretary of State tor War is of the opinion that no action-can be taken without legislation.:      I find it difficult, to believe that no way csn-Tse found to deal with the question administrativel&apos;y.    In any cas* I hope the Cabinet will esk that the whole position may bo xu^the^ examined before endorsing this conclusion.(Intd)   MVS, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 24th August,&quot; 1917-
