Operations to-day were partly sucr pended owing&apos;to cloudy and wet weather.2nd Army...    On the Kal plateau to-day advanced troops of the 27th Corps were counter-attacked with some vigour by the 7th Mountain Brigade and 2 battalions of 3rd Mountain Brigade moved from St. Lucia and St, Maria with artillery and machine guns. Batteries with-&apos; drawn to the east of Chiapovano valley-are supporting the rearguards on-west--side of valley.    In the positions about Tolmino March batt-alions complete, are being used by Austrinns to replace Mountain troops sent to Kal plateau.   Between the Kal plateau and Kalenec the follow-ing Austrian troops from north to south have been identified; 6 battalions of 64th and 37th Regts, 9th Regiment of 24th Division and the 73rd Division; remainder of 24th Division is believed to be in this sector.-with 10th Division in reserve.   Prom Kalenec towards San Daniele: is the 43rd Division which has only its 20th and 24th Regts. at approximately fall strength. Here are also one or two battalions of 71st Regt. from 14th Division to reinforce 43rd Division, In the gap between San Gabriele and San Daniele is the 5th Brigade which fell back from Monte Santo pivoting with its left on San Gabriels, The troops occupying Tolmino bridgehead are the 7th Mountain Brigade consisting of 4 battalions of 6 companies each, 3rd Mountain Brigade consisting of 7 battalions and. 4 battalions of 22nd Brigade, making 15.bat tallonsy- in&apos; al1 of exc ept i onally good troops. To-night: weather is fine, -and if satisfactory to-morrow the attack will probably be driven home on San Gabriele, San Daniele and San Marco,   Artillery is not yet all in position for attack on Tolmino /defences ,and. possibly the attack here may   be postponed for a little.
To-day about 500 prisoners&apos; were taken *3rd Army.   No change.   Infantry is in readiness for fresh offensive, but an extensive move forward of the heavy artillery is in progress-     During next day or two a renewal of 3rd Army attacks is unlikely, especially as so much of the artillery is required to support the San G-abriele, San Danielc and San Marco operations,   About 400 prisoners -were taken to-day.Information has been received that 11-th Austrian Division is on the way from Russian front.    It consists of 5Pth, 89th, 90th and 95th Regiments, probably 14 battalions in all.    Last contact on Russian -front was with 58th and 89th on August 18th.The Austrians have armed some of the labour gang employed by them and are using many Russian prisoners to carry ammunition etc.- for their batteries   in action. Information received from Berne states that Austria is making urgent appeals to Germany for help against Italy. An ammunition depot at Udine was exploded to-day. A consid-erable amount of heavy shell, trench mortar and&apos;aeroplane bombs, hand grenades, rockets etc. were lost.   Wo informa-tion as to quantities is yet available.
