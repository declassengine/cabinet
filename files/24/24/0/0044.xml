SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BPW/014.Weekly Report on Poland.   XIV. (24th August, 1^17.)Internal Politics.Internal politics in Poland are more hopeless than ever. A wave of excitement has swept over the country as a result of the Russian Revolution; men dreamt dreams and saw visions; and desperation worked where hope was lacking; popular indignation was rising at the German robberies; there.was the pinch of food-shortage and the threat of yet worse starvation.     Living popularforces were behind the politicians and a tide was rising which, if taken at the flocd, might hav6 led on to fortune.    But the momont was missed and now for the time being all this is a matter of the past.    The hopes which have been built on the Russian Revolution have given place to depression, the food crisis has passed, the peasants are busy ert the harvest, for the future agreements are likely to be concluded with the occupying Powers concerning food Batters; the military organisations of the Radicals and Socialists  have been broken up by the German arrests.    But the politic lens have remained and continue to plough the san&amp;s. Por almost ten months thoy have talked, formed parties (some 20 of. them) seeeded from parties, quarrelled about things real and unreal, till at last no one knows where he stands - except the Germans. Polish politics are like the buzzing of an over-tired brain in sleep; or again they remind one vividly of a suburban mock parliament -the same gravity of manner, the same amount of makc-belief, and Jjfc very nearly an equal degree of futility.     Yet parts of the administra-tion are now at last being handed over to the Poles; beginning v/ith
September 1 all the law courts will be in polish honds and soon also the schools.     But the Council of State continues to crumble away.    Some more members are reported to nave -handed in their resignations, thour.-,n now the: time has certainly&apos; passed for cloin;-, so on grounds of principle.    After allj it is settled that the present Council is soon to give place to a new government and a new Council and some one must remain in charge of business during tho period of transition.    Whatever blunders the present Council may have committed since May 1, the cUty when ailsudski uneuccess-fully proposed that they should resign in a body, some of the people who now stick to the work durin:  the period of transition probably deserve more respect them those who desert theru, in the idea that this mir;ht improve their chcince of reappearin., in the next Council, or elae that they may go in for the delightful pastime of kicking a dyin/^ beast * &quot;because they iaagne that this will further their party interests.    Meantime the period of trans-it ion wkA*k again threatens to be of long duration.    The Germans have no reason to be in a hurry about forming a Polish government as long as Polish politicians remain v/ell employe;; in intrigues, quarrels and mutual recriminations.    Poljn-i is not likely to be any longer a factor of any weight in the war, except as an object of diplomatic ^test.    A field seems to open before some of her politicians in the line of peace intrigues. Peace Intrigues.Count Adam Tarnowski of Sofia f;uno is active at Stockholm, Count Goluchowski, the late Austro-hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Switzerland.     It is by no means an accident that Polish diplomats should be sent by Austria to conduct her peace intrigues in the two most important neutral centres of Kurooe. Of the races which rule Austria-hungry - the Germans, Magyars and Poles - only the last have got access to western Europe, and Austria will know how to make the most of it.     This was only to be expected;
we wrote in our weekly report of May 3, 1917: &quot;Durin..: the coming months Peles will be found strenuously working for peace, and their endeavours in this direction are the more dangerous an: their legitimate aspirations have sympathisers in every European Chancellery (except perhaps in Berlin)&quot;.Switzerland is once more humming with Polish intrigues. Emigre politicians have gone there from the Western capitals. At the same time Prince Bustaod Sapieha, a candidate for a big post ifc the next governmenti iC. de Stecki, the national Pemeorat leader from Lublin who ever since November 5, 1916, Seems to have worked with the Austrianc yet without ever definitely committing himself, and now also expects to fill one of the fitfst places in tho new-Polish government at Warsaw, and a few minor politicians are reported to have come from Poland.    &quot;As-usual they are &quot;trying to get food for her starving population&quot; - it certainly proves remark-able foresight to do that just when the new harvest is coming in; but rumour alleges that they are also to take part in political con-ferences arrangod under the auspices of the notorious Austrian diplomatic agent, kais. und kttn. Legationsrat Herr von Skrzynski. There is a proverb in Poland that a clever calf sucks two mothers. -Meantime among the strivers in the camp of the original pro-Austrians in Poland signs of fear can be perceived lest their paBt merits and the sins of their opponents should ]je forgotten.     The men who can serve as a channel to Western Europe are more valuable at present to Austria than the enthusiasts of the new practically defunct Legions..     A softening of hearts with regard to Austria is noticeable in the National Democrat press.     Their Petrograd daily, the Dziennik Polski, admitted in its issue of July 13   1917, that the Inter-Party Union in Warsaw has &quot;agraed to a milder tone with regard to Austria provided she emancipates herself from the Prussian influence&quot;, a proviso which can hardly be meant seriously.
u^Meantime the Kurjer Poznanski, the chief paper of the national Democrats in Posnania, cynically admits in its issue of July 24 the truth about the relations of the Poles to the Austrian govern-znent: &quot;If at the present moment our representatives have passed into opposition, the chief reason for it is that the government ofGalicia has been entrusted to alien hands......... It is howeversaid that a restitution to the previous condition is imminent. When that comes, willy-nilly the Polish Club will have to revert to its previous attitude with regard to the Austrian government; it will have to pay for power at home by supplying the government with the necessary number of votes in Parliament.&quot;    The old scheme therefore of paying for dominion over the Little Russians (Ukrainians) in Galieia by subservience in Vienna is now receiving a public &quot;placet&quot; from the National Democrats. Polish Imperialism and the Pope!s Hote.The example of Galicia may serve as a warning; it shows the unavoidable consequences of giving rope to Polish Imperialism. Polish rule over non-Polish districts - over Lithuanians, wliite Russians or Little Russians - would not make Poland strong, but weak and hopelessly dependent on the Germanic Powers.    Neither Russia nor the Ukrainians can ever accept any other frontier than that of ethnographic Poland; also the Lithuanians feel a passionate hatred of the Poles.     With the three nations, Lithuanians, White Russians and Little Russians, it is the hatred felt by a land-hungry peasantry for its alien landlords.     (The Polish nobility owns 39.a per cent of the total area of Lithuania and the Ukraine.) Who could guarantee their dominion over Lithuania, Y/hite Russia or over provinces torn cut of the body of Little Russia, who could safe-guard the Poles against the claims and the hostility of these nationalities and of despoiled Russia except the Germanic Powers? The allusion to &quot;the territories forming part of the ancient King-dom of Poland&quot; in the Pope*s tfote may therefore be described ae one
of its most dangerous proposals.     It clearly points to the Polish claims as to Lithuania, Choim, Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. Poland1s claims against Prussia for Posnania, Upper Silesia, parts of Y/est Prussia and an access to the sea, rest on the infinitely*sounder ground of nationality and require no appeal to history* Even more: the polish claim to the invaluable coal region of Upper Silesia could hardly be upheld on grounds of history although the percentage of Poles in that district is higher than in almost any other part of Prussia; Silesia has never since 1340 formed part ef &quot;the ancient Kingdom of Poland&quot;.    But then neither Silesia nor V/est Prussia nor even Posnania are &quot;available&quot; in case of immediate peace negotiations, whilst the provinces which. Polish imperialists propose to tear from Russia are at present in enemy occupation. Moreover these Polish claims coincide also with the wishes and interests of certain influential clerical circles.     On July 17, 1916, I reported in a letter to Lord Robert Cecil on an interview between a Pole in Switzerland and Count Ledochowski, General of the Jesuits.     &quot;Count Ledochowski,&quot; I wrote in that letter, &quot;talked to him openly about Russia and the Polish Question and admitted that in his view the most desirable thing for the Roman Catholic Church would be the detachment from Russia of all-territories in-habited by Roman gatholios, and hinted also that this was more or less the view held at the Vatican.     They have definitely dropped the idea of the possibility of a union with the Russian Church and seem to be taking up a decided stand against Russia.&quot;    Thus the idea of getting for the Poles some of &quot;the territories of the ancient Kingdom&quot; (other than those to which they have a right on grounds of nationality) is by no means new in Vatican circles.     (One might further compare.Count Ledochowski&apos;s statement with the claim raised in M. Bmowskif s book on &quot;Problems of Central and Eastern Europe&quot;that Poland should include among others &quot;those provinces..............Where the majority of the inhabitants are Catholics&quot; - and
&apos;ne proposes to take from Russia the governments of Kovno, Grodno and Vilna, and parts of Volhjtnia, and the government- of Minsk. This frontier is apparently based on the present German &quot;war map&quot;.) Ukrainian Intrigues.Reports have been received from Switzerland alleging that the Greek-Catholic Metropolitani^dhbishop of Lemberg, Count Szeptycki, who had been* interned by the late Russian government but has been released by the revolutionary government, has come to Switzerland with an authorisation from the Ukraine Rada to conclude a separate peace for them in case the German armies advance deeper into the Ukraine.    whether this is true or not, there can hardly be any doubt that Count Szeptycki*s own sympathies must lie that way. If the Ukraine gets separated from Russia and comeB under a pro-tectorate of Mittel-Europa, all the pov/ers in the Ukraine State would be likely to work for a separation of the Ukraine Church from that of Russia and for union with Rome, if for no other reason, then at least in order to deepen the gulf between the Little Russian (Ukrainians) and the Great Russians.Count A. Szeptycki personally may be a sincere Ukrainian, although there is in him also the Polish aristocrat, and he has far less in common with Russia than the average Ukrainian (his brother is a Roman Catholic Pole and now Governor of the Austrian sphere of occupation in Poland).     But certainly religion comes with Arch-bishop Szeptycki before nationality, and when reverting to the Church of his ancestors, it was from love of the Uniate Church that he became a Ukrainian, and not for the sake of the Ukraine that he became a.Greek-Catholic.     It is alleged that various Polish politicians who have gone to Switzerland propose to meet him aloo - a combination from.which no good can be expected for Russia.L.B.H. 24/8/17.
