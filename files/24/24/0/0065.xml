SECRET.Operations . From:- Brig. General Delmc Radcliffe. To J -     C * I * &amp; * S *26th Augustr 1917, Handed in 5 a.m.No. 347.   August 25th.To-night situation at 10 p.m. is as follows:-2nd Army.     27th Army Corps has 2 divisions on Lorn Plateau.     On the ridge between Kal and Veli Vrh enemy is still holding a slight line.of defence which will be attacked when sufficient artillery has been brought up.     Front of 14th Corps now extends from Korenj, north of Point 981, to north of Volnik (Point 855).     On wooded ridge west of Chiapovano Valley down to liOkovec enemy has still some detachments.   Front 24th Corps extends from Volnik to Podlaka (Point 873).   At Volnik this afternoon some enemy detachments with machine-guns were making some resistance. 2nd and 6th Army Corps are now on the line Points 873 - 756 - 664 -857 - Bavnica and it is expected that to-night Monte San Gabriele will, be completely surrounded.     Italian troops in some places have been able to march across the plateau in columns and deployed. By tomorrow&apos;. General Capello expects to hold left side of whole Chiapovano&apos; Valley as well as to have some troops moving south-east towards Ternova.    19th division of the 27th Corps is facing St. Lucia and 64th division facing St, Maria.     Tolmino bridgehead will be attacked when sufficient artillery and troops are in position on the Lorn Plateau.     At Grapa, south-east of Tolmino, on the railway, a large ammunition depot was exploded yesterday by Italian aeroplanes, and photographs, which I have seen to-day, show that apparently 400 yards of railway, many hutments, and the ammunition depot have disappeared completely.   Thus all communica-tion by rail with Tolmino is for the present cut.     Two or three thousand more prisoners were taken to-day on the Bainsizza and 2nd Army Corps alone took about 50 guns, including two 12 inch howitzers and their tractors.        Total captures not yet known. Attack on St. Marco not yet taken place, but Capello says he will turn 500 guns on the San Marco as soon as he has dealt with St.. Gabriele and San (one group undecipherable).    There is no informa-tion of further reinforcements for the Austrian forces but there was some indication of order being re-established in their retirement and of an intention to take up a defensive position on the eastern edge of the Chiapovano Valley and to cover Ternova. As regards losses 50th division has had probably medium losses and 1st division light, 21st division is practically destroyed, 106th division practically destroyed,24th division probably lost half its strength, 73rd division has had some losses in two days fighting and is worn out by this and its rapid march in the great heat from the south of the Carso, 43rd division has lost heavily, while 57th, 58th and 40th divisions can so far have had only slight loss.     Demoralization of Austrian troops is, however, pretty complete and it is shown by telephone messages intercepted that the troops occupyingthe
2.the defences about Tolmino are in a very nervous state,   A Cavalry Brigade is now on the Bainsizza Plateau and a division has been sent to Farra, north-east of Gradisca.     Italian synthetic phosgene gas shells have had deadly effect and a grea many corpses of men and animals killed by this means have been found.5rd Army.     On this front nothing to report, except that the relief of the brigade is proceeding with alacrity. About 200 prisoners were brought in to-day and there is reason to believe Austrian command Is under impression that the Italian attack on Carso was nothing but a large demon-stration and will not be repeated.      It has in consequence put in all its reserves.     As far as men are concerned, therefore, the Italian 3rd Army should meet much less resistance when It next attacks.    It was claimed by French artillery that Opcina railway station and junction had been completely destroyed by the long range fire of their 340 millimetre guns near Monfalcone.   This would have been Important as interrupting the railway at a critical moment, but to-day I was shown by the General Staff of the 3rd Army some splendid photographs by the French aviators and can find no traces of the line being damaged.Total casualties British artillery -since the beginning of offensive: 7 killed, 5 wounded;   since the batteries came to Italy:    17 killed, 53 wounded in all.     All is going well with the British batteries and the ammunition is arriving well.
