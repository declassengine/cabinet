it?&apos;DEPARTMENT OF IIFORkATIOIINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.AGV//016.1014WEEKLYREPORT01GERMAHYAugust 21, 1917-1.     Until sufficient evidence to the contrary is forth-coming, it may be doubted whether the Ger-aan Government will seriously endeavour to make much capital out of the announcement of the British Government&apos;s refusal of passes for Stockholm. The German Radical and Socialist Press is being allowed to denounce the Western Allies1 decision, but the supporters of the present system in Germany opposed the original visit of Scheidemann and his colleagues and are probably inclined to rate their own Government for not adopting the attitude of the Western Powers towards the Stockholm Conferences.     Mr. Gerard&apos;s latest revelations as to the real Germon terms of peace, the authenticity of which seems beyond doubt, will show the German Majority Social-ists how they have been tricked and used as deooy ducks in order to entice the western democracies into a snare with those terms at the end of it.     At present it is naturally the cue of the German Majority Socialists to denounce the western Allies&apos; decision and to throw the entire odium of it on the British Government.     There is a violent article in the Socialist Vorwarts of August 14 in this strain.     It is worth noting that the Vorwarts in this article brackets America with England and talks of &quot;England and America and their satellites&quot; as refusing passes and &quot;brutally interrupting the work of reconciliation begun at Stockholm&quot;.     The separate denunciation of Prance and Italy seasoned to suit French and Italian Socialist palates will doubt-less follow in due course.     The Vorwarts at the same time de-nounces Xerenski&apos;s present action as &quot;in no way differing from that of the Cadet Miljukoff last May, which cost him his office&quot;. This is merely bad temper, since the German Conservative Press
has Already been holding up the Russian extremists as a warning to the German people against giving their own Socialists any influ-ence upon the conduct of the war or upon foreign policy.    The Conservative press likewise points out that no hopes of a reason-able (i.e. a German) peace can be built upon the views of the Western Socialists or of the English Labour Party.     &quot;The French Socialists do not renounce Alsace-Lorraine, and the English Labour Party demands the restoration of and compensation to Belgium, the restoration of Poland, etc.&quot;   (Kreuzzeitung, August 14).The organ of the great Rhenish and Westphalian ironmasters, dealing with the conditions of peace adopted by the English Labour Party after its decision to send representatives to Stockholm, says:-&quot;Some German papers look upon these ridiculous conditions, whioh could only be realised by the complete overthrow of Germany, as the beginning of an international understanding. Some people are only too pleased if the enemy stops short of annexing half Germany&quot;.     (Rheinisch-v^estfalische feeitung).But the future attitude of Labour in England and elsewhere willdoubtless be carefully watched.2. Comments on the Pope^ peace initiative are stillundecided - perhaps purposely sof     I have found, so far asthe-Germany is concerned, some confirmation of tfeie assertion in aBerlin paper of August 14, that, according to a we11-informedpolitician, &quot;the Pope is too good and too sharp-witted fco diplo-matist to have undertaken such a step without previously assuringhimself as to how such a step would be received&quot;.     The Kreuz-zeitung; of August 5 said:&quot;If the Pope is going to make detailed proposals as to the aims which Germany must attain in the understanding about peace and as to the means by which that understanding must be brought about, then our confidence in his neutrality will be seriously shaken&quot;.It looks as if this extreme Protestant paper had received anearly hint that a peace initiative by the Pope was about to bepublished.     Both protestant and free-thinking Germany would, as
in the past, take alarm if the Pope were to interfere in internation* (al politics.     In this connection the suggestion is already being made in the German Press that after the war the question of a guar-antee of the neutrality of Pepal territory will once more come up and may take practical shape.     All this shows on what dangerous ground the German Government would he treading if it were to en-courage Papal initiative.The Pope&apos;s reference to Alsace-Lorraine in his note is very vague, but his hint about &quot;taking into account as far as is just and possible the aspirations of the peoples&quot; is not re-garded as a suggestion of a plebiscite.     The Holy 8ee&apos;s   memories of the plebiscite of 1870 in Rome cannot be agreeable *    After Rome had been entered on September 20 of that year by Victor Emanuel&apos;s troops under General Oadorna, a vote of the inhabitants was taken, when 133,681 votes were given for union with the Kingdom of Italy and only 1,507 against,3. There is no reason to believe that Michaelis0 adhesionto the Reichstag non-annexationist resolution of July 19 is any more sinoere than were the assurances which Bethmann-Hollweg was understood to have given to the Majority Socialists, and which were confirmed in private letters (Harnack&apos;s revelations), on the subject of annexations and indemnities.     Indeed, all the private reports which have been received, such as those from Copenhagen and from Lausanne, indicate that Germany certainly contemplates annexations on her Eastern frontier in some cases with the ex-pected aid of the Independence movements in the Ukraine and in Finland.     According to one of these reports &quot;Germany is willing to guarantee the position of the Ukraine as an independent state ^)n condition that Germany should have the neighbouring part of South Russia and that Ukrainian troops should hold the Eastern front for them!:.     In this connection the journeyings of Mgs. Szeptyoki, Metropolitan of the Uniate Greek-Ruthenian Church at Lemberg, are exciting attention, especially in the French and
Swiss press.     Szeptycki, who was an active agent 01 the Ruthenian policy of Austria in Galicia before the war, was deported to Siberia on the Russian occupation of Lemberg and. was very harshly treated.     The Revolution has set him at liberty, but his sympa-thies remain entirely Ukrainian.     He has recently been at Lausanne, whence he has been endeavouring - it is said unsuccessfully - to communicate with the Pope - and has now proceeded to Lucerne to meet Erzberger.     His influence in the Ukraine is very great, and it is regarded as very remarkable that as a member of the Polish aristocracy he should have devoted himself to the cause of Ruthenian or Ukrainian nationality.The annexationist German ^ress endeavours to make out that Michaelis&apos; revelations regarding the secret Franco-Russian treaty on the future of the left bank of the Rhine en-tirely altered the basis upon which the Reichstag voted its reso-lution against all annexations.     Liichaelis himself, in his inter-pretation of the Reichstag resolution, s^oke of &quot;guarantees&quot; for the existence of the German Empire upon the Continent and over-seas,     he believed that this, amon^; other aims, could be obtained within the limits of the Reichstag resolution.     He doubtless interprets ^guarantees:&apos; in the same sense as Sethmann-Hollweg, i.e. &quot;rectifications of frontier11 and German economic and mili-tary control over Belgium.4. At the beginning of the fourth year of the war,German public opinion is bein.3.&quot; hardened by the circulation in the whole press of figures showing the amount of enemy territory occupied by the German armies, the Entente losses in killed, wounds ed and prisoners, the Entente tonnage sunk, and the war expenditure of the Entente Powers as comp:red with that of the Central Powers. The 548,700 sq. km.  (more than the superficies of the whole. German Empire) ,which Germany claims to have occupied, is doubtless re-garded as a pledge in her hands foi the peace negotiations.
5. Comforting assurances are being given with regard tothe state ox the German exchange.     It is pointed out that the discount on the French Exchange is now 23^ and on the Italian 40)^     At the time when the German Exchange had not sunk below the first-mentioned discount, there were plenty of comments in the French press upon its desperate condition.     But now even the pound sterling is at a discount of 16/;&apos; in Switzerland.     The view is ex-pressed that after the war the foreign exchange will be improved for Germany by the immediate export of German goods of all kinds, although a further temporary fall may have to be faced in order to import raw materials which are absolutely necessary.     In this connection the Chamber of Commerce of IC6*nigsberg has addressed a petition to the Imperial Chancellor deprecating the proposals for the official tutelage and regulation ox ex-orts and imports after the war-     The view is expressed tha*t the less official regulation and coercion, the better the   chances of recovery for German industry and commerce.6. Preparations for the new German loan are going on andgreat importance is attached to getting farmers to subscribe;    it has been suggested that the payment of the instalments should be arranged to fall due so that the farmers would have the proceeds of their crops in hand at the time when payments would have to be made.     The bonds, it is urged, should also be delivered directly to the applicant against payment, in order t&amp; simplify matters for agricultural subscribers.7. To correct last Report:    It appears that the PrussianMinister of Public 7/orks, von Breitenbach, is to fremain vice-PreEi-dent of the Prussian Ministry, while Helxferich joins that Ministrywithout a portfolio.   Helfferioh is to be vice-Chancellor in theEmpire, and it looks as though his main work is intended to be in%the direction of peace proposals and negotiations.G.S. El. 8. 17.
