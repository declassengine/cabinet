4j2-12 550 P jJ R A I 10-1:8.SJ1MI.vFrom :- General Delme Radcliffe,Gomando Supremo, Italy.21st August 1917.ToC.I.G.b., Jar Office.7.0 a.m.330 August 20th.Situation Julian front this evening 7.0 p.m.2nd Army: passage of Isonzo by the 27th and 24th Corps has been successful in every way.More bridges have been made and both Corps have improved their positions and brought across more troops. 27th Corps with its right flank on the Awschek stream has taken the 3 lines forming the enemyTs first system of defences.     Its line &apos;0i occupation now includes the village of Mesnjak, the Lorn plateau and the Veliki Vrh (points 703 and 574).     Slight resistance ^continues in Awschek Valley which should soon be clear of the en3iay.Jelenik has extended its occupation of Fratta and Semmer up to village of Vrh while 5th Bersaglieri brigade distinguished itself under General Boriani by taking height 716 and Oseoinca.yesterday.     Preparations are being made for the attack on the Jelenik-Kobilek ridge.     Tonight General Capello told me that he hopes to have soon secured room for another 200,000 men on theSituation of 2nd Army seems promisin; this evening.     Jnemy has only one intact division, the 24th, to reinforce on this portion of the front and has already absorbed a proportion of the March24th Corps with its right flank on the line Rodez -Rest of line of 2nd Army is not much changed sinceplateau.Prisoners taken by the 2nd Army now amount to 3,000.troops in reserve.
The enveloping movement of 27th Corps towards the S.E. may reach Chiapovano gorge in which is the road by which all supplies are brought to Bainsizza plateau as far south as Monte Santo.    Hungarian troops on this part of the line are fine material if rather young but the Bohem-ian troops have no desire to fight and the 8th Bohemian Regiment has been withdrawn as unreliable. 3rd Army: 11th Corps again took Hill 464 with the Lom-bardia Brigade but at 5.p.m. there was great concentration , of 12 inch guns and other very heavy fire on it and it may have been lost again.     This Corps also took points 378 and 363 and the enemy&apos;s first line trenches which it still holds.     No progress has been made by 25th Corps.   23rd Corps has made slight advance to a line running from Castagnevizza straight to the eastern edge of the Stari Lokva.     In the lager Coriti alone 3,000 prisoners were taken.     From the Stari Lokva the line of occupation runs along the ridge on the north side of the Jamiano-Brestob&amp;zza Valley to front 50 where the left flank of the 13th Corps is situated.     Line then includes points 146, 145,and 110 and then goes straight to San Giovanni, all the Flondar line having been now retaken.Total unwounded prisoners reported up to 9.30.p,m. to-day by the 3rd Army 8776,,   Situation on the 3rd Army front is decidedly improved especially by the capture of line defence from Castagnevizza to Selo known as Line K,     Among prisoners taken is an officer who was recently attached to Austrian Embassy in London.     I have not yet received his name. He has stated that the Italian bombardment of the eastern side of Monte Hermada has greatly disturbed the Austrians and that the Austrian troops are suffering much from want of food and water.     As regards conditions of Austrian troops, it Is known that 44th 17th and 48th Divisions have about half
3.their strength left, 12th division has been practically destroyed, 35th division has suffered heavily;   73rd division left laibach August 15th and reached Pliscovizza. S.E. of Comen August 19th.     9th division has been sent in support of the 35th to Mauchinie 28th division has been sent to Coast Brigade area about Duino, 41st division has been sent to the Iron Gates near Reifemberg and is believed to be going to Bainsizza plateau,All the 29th March battalions of the Austrian Army were absorbed before beginning of Italian offensive and there are now only about 40 of the 30th and 31st March battalions left at Stein Radmanrisdorf in reserve.There seems to be less reason for anxiety concerning morale of the Italian army.   It has been fighting all day with great determinationa   There are plenty of reserves still in hand and confidence is general that persistent hammering and the development of the movement on the Bainsizza plateau will break down Austrian resistance, as the end of their resources in men is near.    It is often remarked that the defeat of Austrians would be the best answer to the Pope&apos;s note, British artillery has worked well all day and has been complimented for its services.   So far it has lost only 5 killed and 10 wounded as the Austrians have fired at the British batteries very little.A symptom of the enemy&apos;s condition is the fact that his artillery was much less active to-day, which indicates the commencement of the withdrawal of guns.
S li 0 RET.OPERATIONS.From:- General Delme Radcliffe, Comai-ido Supremo;;  Italy.21st August 1917.To rC.I.G.SVar Office.7.0 p.ra331.Situation today is as follows:-2nd Army.      14th Corps is being put in between the 27th and 24th Corps.     Positions held by the Italian troops on the Bainsizza Plateau are being amplified and Improved, until artillery, rrater and supplies can be brought up.     24th Corps has taken Monte Kuk (point 711) and early to-morrow will attack Monte Jelenikc Roads from the river to the heights are being improved and new ones have been begun.     The advance is to be pressed as soon as possible.     Austrian 24th division has been brought to support of the 21st division and 3 regiments have been already identified in line.     The troops of the Austrian 21st and 24th divisions are now completely mixed and there is much confusion among other divisions also.     It is reported that two battalions of the 50th division are coming south as a reinforcement, otherwise there are no reserves left to the Austrian except March battalions referred to in my telegram 330.     2nd Army has now taken 4,800 prisoners, 14 heavy guns and many light guns, trench mortars, etc Several ammunition depots have been seen to explode and the aqueduct to the plateau has been cut by the Italian artillery at Hunyarie.     27th corps is to make a vigorous push eastward so as to command Chiapovano Valley and out Austrian main lines of communication with the Bainsizza Plateau.     Austrians recently reduced the horses of the artillery etc. by 50$, so that, if they retire, it may be difficult for them to save the materials and stores accumulated on the plateau.     Several heavy guns have been
blown up to prevent their falling into hands of Italians., A new Italian Army Corps, probably to be numbered 27this being assembled at Cividale.3rd Army.   In my telegram 330 I gave about 1,000 prisoners too many, owing to one batch being reported twicer 3rd Army has taken about this number to-day, so that the total prisoners taken by both armies must be about 15,000 this evenings     In spite of repeated efforts 11th Corps has made practically no progress and has failed to hold point 464-, Tho 25th and 23rd Corps have confirmed their occupations of yesterday, while 13th Corps has gained ground and now has its. patrols in Medeazza,,        Preparations to turn the Hermada position from the north and the south simultaneously are being made, and the advance will probably begin early to-morrow,, Austriarfs 10th division, which has one brigade intact, has left for Laibach and it is supposed it is going by train to reinforce right wing.     28th an$ the 9th divisions are fully engaged,, while prisoners state that the Austrian   command is holding back its two best divisions, the 41st and 73rd, in hopes of the Italian offensive dying away in two or three days, when they rely on recovering the ground lost in the offensive by means of vigorous counter-attacks with these divisions.     Austrian prisoners taken to-day appear a good deal exhausted and it is clear that the power of resistance of the Austrian troops is being rapidly exhaustedc   Except at Isonzo and points such as Dosso-Faiti and Castagnevizza Italian losses have been unexpectedly slight, thanks to the extensive system of deep communication trenches and tunnels made by the Italians for themselves and also those captured from the &quot;enemy,,       For example, 23 Corps, which has taken alone about 6,000 prisoners; has had only 2,700 casualties in 3 days fightings    Italian armies still dispose of ample reserves and will continue to press the enemy fcr  some days with the present degree of intensity^ until the artillery ammunition runs shortv Yesterday
morning monitors were in action but I have not yet heard results. Morale of the Italian troops is good andimproving.        The extent and unanimity and force of condemnation of the Pope&apos;s peace note by all officers and by a large proportion of the rank and file of the Italian army is a circumstance worth noting.    Anxiety to its diminishing the fighting power of the troops has fortunately not been justified.
