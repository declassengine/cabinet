BATTLE CRUISER STRENGTH. Memorandum for the War Cabinet,by the Mrst Lord of the Admiralty.The Board of Admiralty desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the serious situation which will arise by the end of this year in regard, to the comparative strehgth of the British and German Battle Cruiser Forces,   Owing to their superiority in armour protection and speed, raids can -be carried out with comparative impunity by German Battle Cruisers on our Coasts and East Coast shipping and succesful scouting work for the Battle Fleet by the Battle Cruiser Torce becomes a matter of considerable difficulty^ and places the Battle. Fleet at a disadvantage on ,ioini:if action with the HiS^h Soa Flects   &quot;&quot;he Board surest that the only way of meeting this danger is by using Japanese Battle Cruisers.   The Japanese are unlikely to consent to such craft &quot;joining the Grand Fleet, and^ in any case, it is doubtful whether, manned by Japanese, they would be a match for the German Battle Cruisers,   ?he Board suggests for.the consideration of the War Cabinet that the Foreign Office should be asked to instruct the Ambassador at &quot;*okio to sound the Japanese Government as to whether they would sell two Battle Cruisers,Tie First Sea Lord has prepared a comparative statement of the fi-ihting strength of British and German Battle C-ruisws of approximately the same date, which shews that the German craft bare much superior in protection and that their guns have considerable greater range than the British.   In speed the slowest German Battle Cruiser exceeds by two knots our slowest, so that they can draw our fastships

The all-round superiority of the VON BER TANN is shown by her 2,000 tons heater displacement.20th August, 1917A
