OPERATIONS.%rom.. - G.O.C., Mesopotamia,To)-p^    Caucasus Military Agent,Repeated C .I.G.S. and C-in-C.,22nd August, 1917. 12-30 a,m.India./ /X.3321,Your T.B.46.General Prjvalski may like to have myfurther views if you will hand following to him.   BeginsIn continuation of my X.3275 I wouldpressing need is for General Baratov to re-establish his troops on line of Dialha as enemy may so reinforce his troops in Jebel-Hamrin and make his position there so strong as to prevent General Baratov from regaining tha-t line, unless this is done without delay.   My troops drove enemy from Shahraban two days ago where he was preparing earthworks and we are now securely established at that place whence we may be able to assist General Baratov&apos;s movement forward to line of Dialha.   If following closely on that movement Your Excellency&apos;s troops could occupy Rowandu% and Suleiman Iyeh from direction of Lake Urmia and Bane respectively it should then be possible for Russian troops on Dialha, which I understand would then be under my orders, to press forward to assist Russian movements from (one group undecipherable) Suleiman Iyeh and occupy Tuz-Kermatli and Klfri.   In carrying out this operation part of my troops could, also assist Russian troops as regards further movements forward from line which allied troops would then be holding, namely, Rowanduz, Suleiman Iyeh, Kifri, Samarra, Saklawiyah.   No doubt Your Excellency will remember that, instead of action of my troops being confined to Tigris as formerly, their respon-sibilities since reaching Baghdad extend to Euphrates line and also towards Kizil-Robat since withdrawal of Russian troopssuggest for Your excellency&apos;s consideration that the most

So long then as my flanks are exposed from direction of Jebel-Hamrin and Euphrates respectively your Excellency will see that it is not possible for me to advance my leading troops beyond Samarra but once allied troops are firmly established at   Kuz-Kermatli. and Kifri it would be possible for me to attack furkish troops in and around QTekrit always provided that no strong movement was developing down Euphrates,     In short I would suggest for consideration that sequence of operations &apos; should be; firstly, establishment of Russian troops on line of Dialha, assisted by British: secondly, advance of Russian troops to line Rowanduz Suleiman ryeh; thirdly, advance of Russian troops to Kifri and Tuz-Kermatli assisted by British; fourthly, advance of British to Tekrit.   By thus taking offensive conjointly we should deny initiative to enemy, break up his concentration which is already behind-hand and sturdy fighting and vigorous leadership should bring complete success to our valiant Russian comrades and ourselves.     Further allied movements could be considered and co-ordinated immediately these preliminary operations are completed. General Maude..   Ends.
