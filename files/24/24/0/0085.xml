SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,WEEKLY REPORT OK GERMANY. XVII.(28 August, 1917).Department of Information.AGW/017.(It Is regretted that this Report extends to so many pages, but In view of the Importance of the Constitutional movement now taking place in Germany, it has been considered necessary to deal with the pclitical aspects of that movement in some detail).(1)   All other news from Germany during the past week is of subordinate importance compared with the fragmentary accounts of the proceedings in the Main Committee of the ReichBtag which have been allowed to reach the public.     The deliberations of the Reich&amp;tag Committees are semi-private.     What is given to thenewspapers is an outline -fee what took place drawn up by tHe Reporter (Berichterstatter), a member of the Committee selected for that purpose.     The reports are compiled in a fashion which is intended to meet the views of all the parties represented on the Committee or at any rate the views of the majority. Nothing is supposed tc be revealed even in peac^e-time which could injure the interests of the country, particularly its military interests.   The good faith cf the members of these Committees;including the Sccial Democrats, has always been remarkable;   and during the discussion of Army and Navy Bills, for example, nothing was allowed to reach the public or the press which could interfere with Germany1s great schemes, although there were always one or two members who were bitterly opposed to them.     No amount of &quot;lobbying&quot; could in those cases extract the information which was so eagerly hunted for.     On the other hand, vrhere a great majority of a Committee takes strong views
$or. a subject - especially where a conflict with the Chancellor or the representatives of the Government is concerned - the report handed. to - the press is worded in such a way that the initiated can read between the lines.     The majority seem on the present occasion to have considered that it was due to the country to give some very broad hints of what took place, and even the gaps in the report are eloquent of the crisis.(2)   The first reports of the proceedings of Monday August 21which were available through Copenhagen were very meagre.   They gavevery little of what the Chancellor, Herr Michael is, said about thegeneral question of peace terms and they gave a mere outline of hisstatement on the PopeTs Peace Note.   Germany, he said, could not makea fresh peace offer, as the answer to her outstretched hand had been!1a smashing blow with the fistn.     (Here he was quoting the Vorwarts,the organ of the Majority Socialists).       It was in these circum-stances that the Pope&apos;s Note had   been sent out.   He could not takeup any position with regard to the Note until Germany&apos;s Allies hadbeen consulted.     But the terms of the Note, he said,&quot;correspond to the attitude we have often made known and to our policy since December 12 last&quot; (the date of GermanyTs peace initiative).    &quot;We are sympathetically inclined towards every attempt to inspire thoughts of peaGe among the nations amid the misery of the war, and ?/e especially welcome the action of the Pope, which in my opinion is based on a sincere desire for impartiality and justice&quot;.The German desire was &quot;an honourable peace for the Fatherland&quot;.Kerr Michaelis repeatedly repudiated the suggestion that the PopeTsproposal was inspired by the Central poY^ers.(3)   The Chancellors speech, which had begun with a reference to his continued consultation with Germany1s Allies, went on to refer to the declarations of war which had been received from Siam, Liberia and China.   All that he had to say about them was:    &quot;TJe have
made it clear to those countries that we shall bring them to account for damage done in contravention of international lav/ to Germany s interests&quot; - an announcement which sounds strange in the mouth of a German statesman, es ^cially in view of Mr Gerard1 s account of his conversation with the Emperor on the submarine question, in which he reports the Emperor as saying:    &quot;Anyhow there Is no longer any international law&quot;.The new Imperial Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Herr von Xiihlmann, who spoke on the following day (Wednesday, August 22) evidently found it necessary to supplement or correct Herr Michaelis&apos; reference to the most recent declarations of war against Germany.&quot;We desire1&apos;&quot;, he alleged, &quot;to preserve scrupulously the rights and vital necessities of the neutrals - so far, of course, as the craft of our enemies, who have trodden under foot the greater part of international law, and our own military requirements permit.     Any ,   *     subsequent weakening&quot; (whether he meant a &quot;weakening&quot; of international law or of the German attitude does not appear) &quot;must be prevented, but this task cannot be accomplished except oh the principle that,  although force counts in policy, justice also counts, and we cannot establish relations.except on these two bases of right and justice&quot;.This reads like a kind cf deathbed repentance^but a very guardedone.(/i)   Herr Michaelis, according to the authorised report of his speech, followed up his references to German relations with Allies and Neutrals by reading a report from Hindenburg, who asserts. that the intensified attacks of the British endFrench are due to the success -of the submarine campaign which forces their hand and makes them try to decide the war on land before complete   calamity overtakes them by the agency of the submarines.      Herr Michaelis himself supplemented Hindenburg&apos;s report and made the singular claim with regard to the Eastern front that &quot;the Army has again and again proved what will-power
%nd determination are able to accomplish even against a numerically superior enemy&quot;I(5)   The Chancellor professed to make further &quot;revelations:;regarding the Allies&apos; &quot;annexation&quot; aims,in particular those of&apos; Russia under the autocracy.     He said that&quot;on March 4, 1915, Russia made the following peace demands x of which England approved by a Note of the same date - namely, Russia to receive Constantinople with the European share of the Straits, the Southern part of Thrace as far as the Enos-Midia line, the islands in the Sea of Marmora, and the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, and on the Asia Minor side the Peninsula between the Black Sea, the Bosphorus and the Gulf of Ismid as far as the river Sakaria in the East.     As a result of further negotiations, combined In the course of 1915-16, Russia obtained a promise of the Armenian&quot; villayets Trebizond and Kurdistan. Per contra Franed claimed Syria with Adana and Mersina ana the hinterland, extending northwards as far as Sivas and Kharput.     England1s share was to be Mesopotamia.   The rest of Turkey in Ssia vfas to be divided into English and French spheres of interest. Palestine was to be in some way internationalised, and the other districts inhabited by the Turks and Arabs, including Arabia proper and the Holy places of Islam,were to be formed into a special federation of States under British suzerainty&quot;.When Italy entered the war her claims had also to be considered,and Herr Michaelis held out the prospect of further revelationsregarding the negotiations with Italy.These &quot;disclosures&quot; were doubtless intended to show how farthe views of Germany&apos;s enemies were removed from the spirit of thePopels Note as well as from the terms of the Reichstag resolutionof July 19 rejecting &quot;annexations&quot;.     There was also a renewedreference to Francefs Secret Treaty with Russia regarding Germanterritory besides Alsace-Lorraine on the left bank of the Rhine,and to Sir Edward Carson&apos;s utterance about throwing the GermanArmies back across the Rhine.x   This, of course, can only mean peace terms as betv/een the Allies,   No demands were presented to Germany.
(6)   These &quot;disclosures&quot; and references must further, as thesequel shows, have been designed by the Chancellor to divertattention from his own attitude towards the Reichstag Resolutionof July 19.   If so, the manoeuvre most signally failed.     Thereports of the Committee1s- session show that the ChancellorTsstatement, though doubtless prepared in anticipation of a challenge,had to be put forward as a reply to a fresh, assault by the CatholicCentre Deputy, Herr Erzberger.   Herr Erzberger, and with him theRadicals (Progressists) and the Social Democrats of both Sections,besides his own followers in the Centre,- must have consideredthat a fresh statement by the Chancellor was imperative in viewof the interpretations which the Fan-Germans of different political:, La.)  -&quot;shades had put upon his former statement of July 19.     For/HerrMichaelis himself had, in accepting the Reichstag Resolution ofJuly 19, made the reservation &quot;as I interpret it&quot;.   He had alsospoken of &quot;guaranteeing by means of an understanding and a policyof give and take the conditions of existence of the German Empireupon the Continent and beyond the seas&quot;.     He had likewise mentioned&quot;safeguards&quot; against &quot;economic blockades&quot; and against the developmentof the league of aims of Germany&apos;s opponents into &quot;an economicalliance against Us&quot;.   These aims he thought might be attained&quot;within the limits of your Resolution as I interpret it&quot;.Meanwhile Mr Gerard1s account of the &quot;guarantees&quot;, regarded asimperative by Herr Michaelis1 predecessor, Bethmann Hollweg, as lateas January 17, 1917, has been published.     These include (1) thevirtual absorption of Belgium (forts of Liege and Namur and otherforts;   possession of the railway lines;   possession of the portsand other means of communication;   no Belgian Army to be maintained;a German Army to be maintained in Belgium;   German commercial controlof the country); (2) &quot;rectification&quot; of the French frontier, i.e.annexations;    (5) substantial rectification of Gormanyfs Easterni
frontier;    (4) a small Serbia to survive if Austria allows it;(5) indemnities to Germany from all the enemy countries and soforth.     Now Herr von Bethmann Hollwegf s fall is believed inBerlin to have been due In part to the intervention of the militaryparty headed by the Crown Prince,.Hindenburg and Ludcndorff,and Herr Michaelis, whose other qualifications are not veryapparent, is supposed to be more acceptable than his predecessorto that party.     Consequently the suspicion has arisen in theReichstag and elsewhere that his ideas of peace terms may be asambitious or even more ambitious than those of Bethmann Hollweg.(b) The Pan-Germans, leading Conservative politicians and theirpress have claimed Herr Michaelis as an :iannexaticnist&quot; and anadvocate of indemnities for Germany.Herr Erzberger and the great majority of the Committee weretherefore determined to get to the bottom of this situation.They wanted a clear and unambiguous declaration of peace policy andat first they failed to get anything like one.     All that theChancellor was at first prepared to say was:&quot;One member has made the criticism that during a speech in the Reichstag on July 19, referring to the Majority1s peace resolution, I used the words:  &apos;That is as I understand it1,   I admit that, during the previous discussions with leaders of the parties, this addition had not been expressly mentioned by me. On the other hand, however, I must state that the expression used by me is not contrary tc my attitude during the discussions, and such as results from the peace aims explained in my Reichstag speech.   There are various ahades of opinions regarding the aims which may be obtained during peace negotiations within the scope cf the resolution.     An interpretation is pcs sible such as I also observed during the previous discussions with the Majority parties&quot;.This statement must have caused sensation, for the Chancellor1sright-hand official, Herr von Graevenitz, the new chief of theImperial Chancellery, got up and tried to explain it away as &quot;a slipof the tongue&quot; (sic).   This explanation did.not satisfy the
(7)   It Is evident that even the second statement of theChancellor after the Committee resumed did not reassure theMajority, nor ha3 it reassured large sections of the German press.Herr Theodor Wolff says in the Eerliner Tageblatt (Radical, Jewish,bourgeois), of which he is the Editor, that after the Chancellorhad made his second statement, the Socialist Deputy Herr Ebertread out a resolution which the Committee had   adopted repudiatingas incorrect Michaelis&apos; first statement, i.e. his own inter-pretation of the Reichstag&apos;s resolution of July 19.     Herr Wolffgoes on to describe Michaelis as&quot;devoid of all authority, partly because, while he is supposed to conduct Germany&apos;s foreign policy, he Is completely ignorant of foreign affairs&quot; (this is perfectly true,  although he may be learning) &quot;and partly because he was appointed without consultation with the Reichstag&quot;.jnaiorl^T of the Committee.     There must, have &quot;been great excitementand apparently a deadlock/ &quot;for the Committee adjourned until thematter could he cleared up.     The agped Herr gmsgmi Payer, leaderof the South German Radicals, was sent to the Chancellor &quot;with anultimatum demanding that he should make a new and unambiguousdeclaration adopting the standpoint of the Reichstag peaceresolution or lose the confidence of the Majority parties.When the Committee re-assembled the Chancellor made a seconddeclaration in reply to this demand&quot;.His second declaration was:&quot;I did not desire to deviate from my speech of July 19 in the declaration made this morning.       My speech of July 19 Is completely maintained by me.   This is&apos; proved by the fact that I have already - this morning -issued invitations for deliberations v/hich will create closer contact between me and the Reichstag, in the first place for discussions regarding the answer to the Vatican.   This answer will, of course, aim at a peace of agreement and understanding such as is expressed in the Reichstag&apos;s resolution of July 19&quot;.
Theodor Volff adds:-15It is no longer possible that a people of seventy millions, who after all have to pay for every fault with blood and gold, should be given a Government without their representatives being consulted. It is the duty of the Reichstag to make an end of this absolutist, bureaucratic system&quot;.&apos;Scme papers demand the dismissal of the Chancellor, othersattribute the crisis to the action of the Pan-Germans Who would notleave the ChancellorTs declaration of July 19 as it stood, butinsisted on interpreting his language as leaving the door open fora policy of annexations.     As the governmental Lokal-Anzeigerwas allowed to publish a special edition with scare head-lines suchas &quot;Break between the Chancellor and the Reichstag Majority&quot;,this was probably intended to damage the Majority in the eyes ofthe public or to try how far it could be branded as unpatriotic.The Socialist Munich Post rightly points out that the Chancellorused a very lame argument In adducing the territorial demands of thedefunct Russian autocracy and that this was a singular reply to maketo the PopeTs Note.     The Vorwarts - and this is important - hintsthat Michaelis&apos; behaviour last Tuesday was anything but TheroicT.If his first statement was a rejection of the peace policy of theReichstag Majority, his second &quot;v;as a complete surrender at thefirst alarm-shot and a miserable denial of v?hat he had just said&quot;.The Conservative and Pan-German press certainly does not try toallay the conflict.     The Kreuzzeitung appears to have said:&quot;Herr Michaelis freed his hands from the fetters of the Majoritydeclaration11.     The Vorwarts takes note of this challenge andconcludes:-&quot;Wednesday^ sittings of the Main Committee again proved clearly that a-^an^lJ^orjg^o^loses the confidence of the majority is impossihle.  &apos; The&quot; Pan-German&quot;Press, of course, will Try&apos;To maTce us believe that we possess a Chancellor who opposes the Reichstag majority, but who is able to maintain his opposition only for a moment, while for the rest of the time he cleverly disguises it&quot;.
(8)   German papers do not write like this about a Chancellorin whom they, have a vestige of confidence.    It is clear that theMajority, or at any rate a section of it, is bitterly dissatisfiednot merely with the Chancellor&apos;s attitude on peace terms but withhis general ideas of political reconstruction at home.   They feelthat both in the Empire and in Prussia they have got newGovernments of bureaucrats on the old system only &quot;more so&quot;.The new bureaucratic appointments are worse than the eld, becausethe men selected, beginning with Michaelis himself,are mostlyunknown to the public, which has no evidence of their specialcompetence or of their sympathy with constitutional andparliamentary aspirations.     On the contrary, in the case oiMichaelis himself a quotation has been unearthed from an essaywritten by him as late as December 1914:-&quot;After the miserable fiasco of parliamentarism in England and of the Republican Constitution in France, what democrat can raise the demand for parliamentary rule in Germany?     who will venture to touch the Kaiser&apos;s Supreme Command and to drive a wedge between soldiers and officers in the Army?    Who will want to throw the noose of constitutional responsibility around the neck of the Chancellor?77But this is precisely what the Kajority are determined to do -to make the Chancellor responsible to Parliament.   The presentwriter attended all the greater debates in the German Reichstagfor twenty years (1888-1908) and he gains from, the accounts ofthe latest crisis as well as from the utterances of Michaelis inParliament and in press interviews a very strong impression thatthe new Chancellor is not the man to &quot;ride the whirlwind anddirect the storm&quot; or even to manage political parties by muddlingthrough.     He is evidently a hard-working official, very abledoubtless in his own sphere, but as narrow-minded as most Prussianofficials are and without any spark of genius or sympathy v,hichwould help him over a difficult situation.     Prince Hohenlohe&apos;s
personal prestige and his distinguished past atoned for a time for the feebleness of old age and his inability to make even the semblance of a debating speech in the Reichstag (1894-1900). Bulov? was a clever fellov vith many journalistic and parliamentary jricks, and he was a good actor.      Bethmann could state and argue a case in the ponderous German fashion, although at the end his nerve seemed to fail him.     Michaelis has neither parliamentary cleverness, nor personal weight, nor, it would seem from Tuesday&apos;s proceedings, parliamentary nerve.     Indications are multiplying that if it be intended to retain him in office for the present, it can .only be a stopgap for some more adroit successor - Kuhlmann or Rantzea., or possibly even Lichnowsky or some dark horse in the Imperial stables in whom there may be the making of a passable statesman according to German standards. They really need a Bismarck, but they may whistle for one in these times.(9)   It may be asked:   What is the importance of political crises in the Reichstag, when, as a Conservative Deputy once remarked, an army lieutenant with a dozen men could clear the whole Place at a momentfs notice.     It is quite true that this could be done and that there would be no immediate resistance any more than there was when Frederick William IV closed the Prussian Constituent Assembly in December 1848.     But it is also true that Germany at the present moment could not stand a coup d&apos;etat of that kind which would involve all the German States and produce a revolutionary ferment everywhere.     The South German States which have liberal constitutions would be bound to protest against any such action and would probably be backed by Austria, who wants an yearly peace.     The German people would lose all heart for the war and would ask themselves if it was for the establishment of
autocracy that they were fighting.     Revolutionary Russia would be correspondingly heartened for the struggle.   In some way or other the Emperor and the Military clique must contrive to keep on terms with the Reichstag.   Bub the present crisis must tend to undermine their influence, and, if it were not solved before the Reichstag meets next month in full session, there would be sure to be grave trouble.     Meanwhile every blow struck at Germany on the TVestern front will strengthen the constitutional party aid weaken the central power of Prussia and the bureaucratic element In the Government.(10)   Are all these dramatic scenes in the Reichstag mere &quot;eyewash1&quot;&apos; for the German people, for tho Austrian peace-party, for the public and especially the pacifists in the Allied countries, and for the Pope and his backers?     As the German song says of the swain&apos;s protestations of love &quot;there is doubtless some falseness in it&quot; (&quot;a bissele Falschheit 1st auch v/ohl dabei&quot;). But it is too dangerous a game to play for long..   A section of the German press on both sides has broken loose.   This sorretimes happens even in war-time, and it nay easily become too dangerous to suppress newspapers.   There are moments when the safety-valves of public opinion have to be left open.     There is evidently great excitement. The mass of the German people - ve have plenty of evidence of that - arc Vory weary of the vor.   By way of consolation they are constantly told that the same feeling prevails in enemy countries, more especially in England and France.     Once and again they had been assured that peace was probably near.   They are asking why their own Government does not take advantage of this situation and get peace - a peace which, in accordance with German accounts of the military situation, would not be an altogether unfavourable
one for Germany.    (Fhen Hindenburg was in Berlin at tre time of the Chancellor crisis crowds surrounded his motor-car in the Wilhelmstrasse and there were shouts of:    ,!Bring us a good peace. Excellency!&quot;     &quot;Bring peace, sooni&quot;).     The masses are probably beginning- to suspect their rulers of delaying the peace they long for by extravagant territorial arbitions or by some now military gamble.   The news from the Yser^ and from Verdun, when it begins to leak out, will assuredly deepen this suspicion. But the people can do nothing, except indulge in feeble, unarmed demonstrations in the streets.   The official warnings against strikes last week and the reports circulated to the effect that written or printed incitements to strike (&quot;of enemy origin&quot;) had been distributed in the munition factories * were probably of a purely prophylactic nature, I.e, intended to prevent any strike or other demonstrations which might have resulted from the news of what took place in the Reichstag Committee.   Those Deputies who represent large industrial districts, like the left wing of the Catholic Centre^ must take account of this state of popular feeling, else they could not show themselves In their constituencies.     The Catholic Centre Deputies are particularly we11-informed through the priests as to the state of feeling in the Catholic districts, and the Vatican has doubtless the same sources of information, although its political relationships make it biassed in favour of what are really Austro-Gorman peace-terms,     Kith the parliamentary &quot;eyewash1&apos; there is therefore, according to all appearances, a great deal of genuine anxiety among the Deputies, and it continues to find expression in the Main Committee and in the press.(Comments on Michaelis1 latest solution for the crisis, i.e. the establishment of a &quot;Free Committee&quot; of seven party leaders
28.8.1V.GS.from the Reichstag and seven members of the Federal Council must be reserved for another Report, as must the new panacea for Alsace-Lorraine which, the Chancellor has brought back from his interview with the Kaiser at Military Headquarters.)
