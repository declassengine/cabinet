(1) 22nd August, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work ofthe Food Production Department for the week ended the 21st August, 1917:-LOCAL ORGANISATION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees * The following are instances of action taken-during the week :-In Lancashire the Executive Committee have inspected an area of 1,800 acres of good land at Hutton and Howick on the South side of the Ribble Estuary owned by a landlord who resides in Berkshire;   most of the land is being farmed by the owner and is In a neglected condition, and the Committee are issuing orders for its cultivation.     In the West Riding of Yorkshire the Executive Committee have obtained the help of the agricultural staff of the Leeds University in examining land at Cranidge which has been damaged by the fumes of coke ovens;   the application of lime and other remedies have been suggested to the owner and tenant.     In Cambridgeshire the Executive Committee have arranged for the breaking up of 28 acres of park land at Newton Hall.     In Denbighshire, the Committee have been authorised to take possession of 92 acres of land left derelict by a bankrupt tenant, in order to secure the cultivation of this land pending the bankruptcy proceedings. In Flintshire, a part of Hawarden Park is about to be ploughed up, with the consent of the owner who is providing material for the necessary fencing.
Drainage of Lands. Action under these Orders is reported from Cumberland, Durham, Middlesex, Flintshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire in addition to schemes previously mentioned&apos; in these reports.Rabbits Order. Action under this Order is reported from Kesteven andSomerset.- -^ County Boroughs.Certain of the County Boroughs (of which there are more than 70) include within their limits considerable areas of agricultural lands     These areas are outside the jurisdiction of the County Agricultural Executive Committees;   and Regulation 2L, the powers under which have been delegated to County Boroughs for allotment purposes, is not appropriate for the control of farm lands. But it is clearly unnecessary to appoint an Executive Committee, for each County Borough, and in most of them it would be impossible to constitute a committee of practical agriculturists.   Accordingly, a letter has been sent to all County Borough Councils drawing attention to the above considerations and suggesting that the jurisf![d tion of the County Committees should be extended to include any agricultural land in the area of County Boroughs within their county, subject to the proviso that a special Sub-Committee should be set up for the County Borough to make enquiries and recommenda-tions to the Executive Committee.     If this procedure is followed, the duty of taking any action necessary under Regulation 2M with regard to such land, will fall upon the County Committee.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (Mo.2). Particulars received from 1,054 Borough or Urban District Councils show that 194,116 applications for plots have been made under the Cultivation of Lands Order, and that 175,700 plots, containing a total area of 13,007 acres, have been provided.
A report from the City of Oxford, where the Order has been administered with enthusiasm, makes special mention of the Merton Meadow allotments.    At the outset failure was foretold -the soil was said to be water-logged, made up .of buildersrubbish and full of wire worm i     In February last the land was gas-limed, and it is now covered with what is stated to be a record crop of potatoes, beans, peas, cabbage, marrow, spinach, turnips, beetrcot, carrots, &amp;c.     Stress is laid on the friendly co-operation of the cultivators, most of whom are women, &quot;married ladies and single women of all ages from elderly spinsters to schoolgirls&quot;, but working amicably side by side with them are representatives of the Church, the Army, the Civil Service, Philosophy and Learning, and Commerce.HORTICULTURAL SECTION.Prom the volume and diversity of the communications received from Horticultural Representatives, it is evident that the experiment of appointing Representatives in the Rural and Urban Districts is meeting with a considerable measure of success.     The Representatives have in many cases succeeded in establishing Food Production Societies and in securing allotments in places which previously lacked them.     The good work done in directing cultiva-tion both by the Horticultural Representatives and the Royal Horticultural Society Panel Gardeners is manifest in the excellence of the crops grown by allotment holders new to the work of cultivation. Fruit and Vegetable Bottling - 143 demonstrations have been given in different parts of the country, making a total of 1,541 demonstrations provided by- this Department.The number of glass jars despatched by the manufacturers during the week is 153,324, making a total of 1,055,396.     The balance remaining to be despatched is 539,222.Potato Spraying - Reports are being received of the beneficial effect due to spraying, and in districts with both sprayed and unsprayed crops, disbelievers in spraying have been converted by the evidence of yields from sprayed and unsprayed crops of similar varieties.
During the week, late blight has appeared in Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Shropshire, and Montgomeryshire, that is, counties further north than those mentioned in previous reports as suffering from disease.     In parts of the home counties late blight has increased considerably in intensity, for example, severe outbreaks have occurred in Surrey.Spraying has been continued with the assistance of the Military in certain parts of North Devon.     The requests for advice and assistance in respect to this are very numerous, and indicate a growing interest in the subject.     A lecture on the Spraying of Potatoes illustrated by photographs and diagrams and intended for general use during the winter is being prepared.Preserving Fruit and Vegetables.     Pulping commenced on August 14th at the station established at Maidstone.     The amount of fruit handled each day is about ^50 tons, work being carried on both day and night.     Owing to the inability of the railways to accept more than a small portion of the fruit offered at the stations, a very heavy strain is being placed on this factory.Pulping commenced at Pershore and Cheltenham on the 13th, and each of these factories is handling about 15 tons of fruit per day.     In the Arrow Preserve ^orks, Broom, which SB&quot; now controlled by the Department, it has been possible as a result of further organisation to double the output of pulp.Delivery of canners and cans for purposes of canning fruit and vegetables began on August 7th.     The number of canners sold during the week is 40, and the number of tins sold for containing preserved fruit is 128 gross.
Marketing.   Although the large questions concerned tfith the marketing of produce fall under the Ministry of Food, many pressing matters relating to marketing are constantly being brought to the notice of this Department.   Inasmuch asassistance in marketing means also assistance in food production,and inasmuch as the lack of sufficient facilities meansconsiderable loss to producers, the Horticultural Division findsitself very frequently engaged in attempts to increase marketfacilities and to encourage co-operative efforts in&apos;marketing.The following instances may be cited:-(1) During the past week, the Department received an enormous number of complaints, particularly from Kent, with respect to refusal of the railway to carry more than very limited quantities of plums.   A consultation with the railway authorities shews that the limitation was due tiot to lack of railway facilities but to the congestion of the London Markets.At the instance of the Department a conference was held at the Ministry of Food, and a representative from the Food Production Department urged the importance of relieving the market of the very considerable quantity -of plums destined for the Army jam-makers which was passing through the jam-makers via the market.   The proposal was put forward that these quantities amounting to 150 tons a day should be consigned direct to the jam-makers.   Agreement was reached on this point, the Railway Company arranged to open their Depot at Stewart&apos;s Lane for the reception of the fruit hitherto consigned to Covent Garden, and for the cartage direct to the jam factories.   Similar arrangements were made for the direct delivery of the fruit which hitherto has passed to the jam-makers via Spitalfields and Borough Markets.(2) Owing to seasonal conditions, the arrival of French greengages on the market co-incided with the arrival of English plums.   Large quantities of both fruits failed to find purchasers and were destroyed.   The French growers and owners of this fruit received nothing for their labour, the trouble of consignment and the cost of carriage, several hundreds of tons of fruit being consigned to the refuse destructors.The representatives of this Department communicated with the Commercial Attache of the French Embassy, and represented the situation to him.   He in turn communicated with the French Board of Agriculture who stopped the supplies of fruit during the glut.From information already received it Is evident that the present glut of plums due primarily to the heavy Kentish
crop is also in part due to insufficient market facilities. The loss and disappointment due to growers failing to find markets are serious bars to the success of any efforts to encourage increased production of fruit, nor is it unlikely that a somewhat similar condition will arise when the large crops of vegetables are ready for the market.The Department are therefore considering whether, in spite of the fact that the Ministry of Pood is the Government Department principally concerned, it is not necessary for the Pood Production Department to concern itself officially with the technical aspects of marketing.   In particular so far as Horticulture is concerned the establishment of co-operative societies would assist and in some measure overcome the difficulties of marketing, some of which have been referred to above.   It is possible that some arrangement may be come to whereby the Agricultural Organisation Society could lend its assistance to the Department in the organisation of Co-operative Societies.   If this were done a considerable benefit to Production would be likely to result.TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land.   A farm of 800 acres in Essex, reported tothe Executive Committee as inadequately cultivated, has beeninspected by one of the Technical Advisers.   Most of the farmis at present in grass, and hitherto attention has been chieflydevoted to stock farming.   Corn growing has been regarded as ofsecondary importance, and the arable land has been underfarmed.The land is held at a low rental, and fair profits have thereforebeen obtainable by relatively easy and unenterprising methods.In view of the national necessity, however, the Committee havedecided to convert this successful stock farmer into an equallysuccessful corn producer.    It is anticipated that a satisfactorysettlement will be reached in the negotiations which are now in progress.
Breaking up of Grass Land,        A field of old grass, ploughed a short time ago, and inspected during the past week, affords a good illustration of the necessity for suitable cultivation.   The field had been ploughed in two different ways.     Where the furrow had been turned over completely in a wide and broken slice, a suitable seed bed could be prepared this autumn by merely harrowing.    Where the furrows had been turned up on edge (as is done by some of the short-breasted American types of plough) they had grown together again, and the field is rapidly reverting to its original condition.     Even where the land had been afterwards disc harrowed, the grass had grown through, and the soil was sodden and unsuitable for a seed bed,US e of,Sulphate of Ammonia for Wheat in Autumn.      Thi s sub j e c t has been discussed by the Technical Committee, who agreed that as sufficient supplies of Sulphate of Ammonia are likely to be available, the top dressing of wheat this autumn should be strongly recommended.     A revised edition of the leaflet already issued on the subject is being prepared, and will be published as soon as the results of last year&apos;s experiments are available. Comparative Money Value of Feeding Stuffs.        With a view to Inducing a more economical purchase of feeding stuffs, a statement has been prepared, and will shortly be published In leaflet form, showing the money values of the chief feeding stuffs as compared with oats at varying prices.Instruction to Farmers in Cow Feeding.      A resolution submitted by Major Astor&apos;s Committee on the Production and Distribution, of Milk, indicating the importance of organising an educational campaign among dairy farmers and suggesting certain lines of action, was considered by the Technical Committee.     Steps are being taken to give effect to the suggestions made by Major AstorTs Committee.
It is proposed to keep the Press supplied with paragraphs giving information as to supplies of feeding stuffs, economical rations etc., and to provide &quot;briefs&quot; for County Lecturers in Dairying, so that adequate instruction may be given to dairy farmers.Plant Diseases.   Upwards of 70 enquiries relating to 41 distinct insect or fungus pests, have been dealt with during the week. Thirty reports have been received from honorary correspondents, giving information as to local outbreaks of disease.   In cases where outbreaks assume serious proportions, steps are taken to combat the pests,LABOUR.Soldier Labour.   The returns so far received from the District Commissioners shew that of the 50,000 men to be made available for the purposes of the 1918 programme, 2,742 skilled, and 2,686 unskilled, have arrived at the Depots.   Some returns are, however, still outstanding.   Of the skilled men 1,679 have been sent out to farmers or placed in charge of teams of horses under the Departments scheme for increased cultivation.   The number of unskilled men sent out during the last two weeks, Including men already at the Depots available for harvest work, is 3,238.   With the improved weather conditions the demand for men Is steadily increasing, and is likely to be very large during the current week.Horses.   Orders for the issue of 729 horses to Agricultural Executive Committees have been sent to Remount Depots up to date.   Arrangements have been made with the War Office that Army horses already on loan to farmers on &quot;meat for keep&quot; terms shall remain out until September 15th, instead of being withdrawn on the 31st instant, as was originally intended. Prisoners of War.   Two new schemes for the employment of
prisoners of war have been sent to the War Office diiring the week.W0MEN&apos;S BRANCH.The work of the Women&apos;s Section of the National Service Department in so far as it concerns recruiting for the Women&apos;s Land Army has been transferred to the Pood Production Department during the week.The returns for this week shew that there are still over 500 National Service women out of employment.   At the same time, there are a few vacancies for experienced milkers, gardeners, etc. which cannot be filled.   The detailed returns are as followsj-In Instruction Centres 1,144On Farm work        ..4,617Waiting for references to be placed in Training Centres   ...... 161Waiting for employment inDepots     ...     ... 271Waiting in their own homes        2946,487The Group Leaders appointed to organise part-time work are proving exceedingly useful in making village labour more easily available for farmers. Specially good accounts of such work have been received from Cambridge and Gloucester.MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS.During the week a further 122 Motor Tractors have been consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales, bringing the total number of tractors placed at the disposal of Committees up to 921. In addition, 87 tractors have been offered to Counties for delivery as soon as they have been assembled.The difficulty of obtaining spare parts for American made tractors, which has resulted in a number of these tractors
remaining idle for long periods, is being gradually overcome by arranging for the manufacture of spare parts by English firms. Two very successful demonstrations with tractors made by Saunderson and Mills were held in Derbyshire during the week which were well attended by local agriculturists.SUPPLIES. Supplies Sub-Committees.      Supplies Sub-Committees in many Counties appear to be taking up their duties with much earnestness and there is an increased appreciation of the Importance of the functions they have to fulfil.     Approved Agents have now been recognised by the Department In eleven counties, and a substantial number of other counties have applications under consideration.A conference has been held with the representatives of the Agricultural Organisation Society and Managers of the larger affiliated Co-operative Societies with a view to inducing them to undertake the storage of Fertilisers.     The cordial co-operation of these Societies is assured.Sulphate of Ammonia.        The satisfactory way that Sulphate of Ammonia is being bought for agricultural use is shown by the fact that although the export during July 1917 was 13,872 tons less than during July 1916, the stocks at makers&apos; works are also smaller by 10,658 tons.     The quantity delivered and ordered for the present season amounts already to 8Q345 tons, i.e. more than one-third of the total estimated output.Potash.      The Order controlling the sale of Blast Furnace flue dust has been issued, and the Ministry of Munitions is now collecting statistics as to the amount of dust produced at each Blast Furnace, together with the particulars of the potash content. As soon as these statistics are available, the Department will be in a position to arrange for distribution.
Feeding Stuffs.   A scheme has been prepared for securing an adequate supply of oil-cake and milling offals for the use of cows in&apos; milk during the coming winter,   This scheme is now being considered by the Ministry of Food. The main feature of the scheme is the issue of a priority certificate to dairy farmers which will enable them to purchase sufficient supplies of oil-cake and offals to maintain their cows in milk in preference to the demands of other keepers of live-stock.   To give effect to the scheme it would be essential that the Board should have sole control of the distribution of feeding stuffs from the moment the materials leave the makers&apos; works, without interference from the Ministry of Food, and that maximum prices should be fixed.   Representations to this effect have been made to the Ministry of Food, especially with a view to securing a reduction of price.Wire fencing.   In order to meet farmers requirements, makers have been asked to manufacture certain quantities of wire for fencing and sheep netting on a guarantee from the Department to take over any unsold balance.Seed ^Theat.   The demand for seed of the 1916 crop is still small but an additional 50 quarters have been sold during the past week.   The results of the germination tests carried out by Professor Biffen at Cambridge are very satisfactory and show that almost all the parcels secured are suitable for sowing.The work of. the Committee engaged in selecting seed of certain varieties of wheat of the 1917 crop is almost completed. Reports continue to indicate that the crop has suffered considerably from unfavourable weather and consequently the supply will be less than was expected.
1 9 r-L &amp; t)Seed Potatoes, The Department have now been informed that the Board of Agriculture for Scotland have agreed to the issue of the proposed Order relating to the control of certain immune varieties of potatoes of which the supply is extremely limited.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rd. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
