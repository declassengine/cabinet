Italy of the 17th ^ugust 1917SECRET.No.1240.I forward herewith 3 copies of a map&quot;with thepositions occupied by the Italian and Austrian Corps and Divisions roughly indicated on it.summarised as follows50 Divisions of infantry, 2,100 guns&apos; and howitzers of 4-inch calibre and upwards, 1,600 field guns, 1,700 trench mortars (of which 800 are of 240 mm. type and of these again 300 are of the latest long model with a range of 400 yards).Amongst the Italian artillery are included 34 French guns and howitzers, manned by French personnel, and 65 British howitzers all of 6-inch calibre, except one experimental weapon of 9.2-inch calibre.The French artillery is distributed roughly asfollows24 howitzers of 155 mm. are with the Ilnd Army.     The remainder, ohiefly much heavier guns, is with the Illrd Army.     I understand that the French artillery has been lent for the offensive only and will return to France v/hen it is over.three groups of 8, 3 and 5 batteries respectively and are all with the Illrd Army-     The 9.2-inch howitzer, which only arrived today from England, is to go into an already prepared position in the Vallone.intention of making two principal thrusts, one on the Carso and the other towards the Bainsizza plateau.The strength of the Italian forces may beThe British 6-inch howitzers are distributed inThe Italian forces are distributed with the0        Hfrt *\J^4,*WL&amp;*
Between the two lies the Gorizia depression in which the Italian front is held by one Army-Corps only, the VTIIth., with its four divisions. The Vlllth Corps for thepurposes of the action, is temporarily transferred from the Ilnd to the Illrd Army.The Italian heavy artillery is distributed along the whole front in positions corresponding to the tactical intentions and with a view to securing the largest degree of enfilade fire cn the enemy&apos;s positions.The Commanders of the -two Armies are the same as at the time of the May offensive. The Duke of Aosta andGeneral Cappello have each a force of about 25 divisions at their disposal.The Austrian forces may be summarised as follovirs :-256 battalions of infantry, 900 strong on the average, formed into 21.divisions of varying strength.     The total number of guns of all calibres is about 2,385 and 916 trench-mortars from Tolmino to the sea.        The Austrian artillery strength has not been materially increased on the Carso, whereas it has been so on the Bainsizza plateau as compared with its strength last May.But the weakness of the Austrian army is in the-matter of its reserves.   The total of the March battalions Nos. 29, 30 and 31 was 220 on the whole Italian front and 152 on the Isonzo front at the beginning of August, with an average strength of 500 to 600 men.   The whole of the 29th Battalions probably have already been absorbed and some of the 30th Battalions also-     There cannot now be more than abcut 70?000 men of the 30th and 31st Battalions in reserve.The Austrian lossos during the last offensive were not less than 80,000.   Consequently if the present offensive inflicts the
same losses on the Austrians, the reserves will have been exhausted for the time being. Further Italian pressure would then lead to a capital loss and, in view of the long front of attack, probably to substantial results.The Austrians are calling up the men of 17 and 18 years of age in September. They, of course, would come too late for service this year. The combing out of ammunition factories; is not likely to increase the field forces in time to bo of any use and there are real grounds for anticipating a diminution in the ammunition supply.Compared with the Austrian reserves, the Italian army lias plenty to meet any present calls, but it is stated that in the future only a few more reserves- can be called up. It appears that the civil Government is resisting strongly General Cadorna&apos;s call for more men/The Austrian forces have the advantage of position everywhere as they have complete-observation on all the ground over which the Italian troops must attack.     The Italian objectives on the Carso are, as before, to secure possession of Monte Hermada which dominates all the Southern part of the Carso and the Tristlj - Stol ridge, which dominates all the Northern part and the Gorizia depression. If one or the other of these points be secured, the positions now held by the Austrians on the Carso will be -to a great extent turned and the enemy would be forced to retire to lines from which it will become increasingly difficult to cover Trieste and the railways which lead to that place and thence, Southwards to Pola,-The possession of the Bainsizza plateau would similarly enable the Italians to turn the Austrian positions above and East of Gorizia and eventually also those on the Carso. General Cadorna thus hopes, by extending his front of attack so much, to succeed in forcing the enemy back at one or more of the important points and then outflank and force hi3 lines at other parts of the front.
It soems unlikely that the enemy can bring.up reserves enough in time to make an effective resistance along the whole front of attack, although it is known that he is already moving troops with feverish haste from the Trentino to the Julian front.The advance of the Italian Illrd Army Involves frontal attacks on very strongly prepared positions, bristling with machine-guns and covered by a numerous artillery of which the fire can be very easily and quickly directed on to attacking troops, thanks to the complete command of view which the Austrians have all across the Carso,On the Bainsizza plateau the prospects for the attackers appear more favourable, as there are many places in the tangled mass of hills where there is dead ground and where there is some possibility cf manoeuvre.     The Italian forces will cross the Isonzo river at a number of points simultaneously.    The XXlVth Corps and the XXVIIth Corps have been directed to make good their footing on the plateau and then, pivoting on the right of the XXIVth Corps, to swing South-Eastwards,   By threatening the enemy&apos;s vital lines of communication up the chiapovanc valley, the advance of the Ilnd Corps and eventually of the Vlth Corps will be facilitated. Meanwhile the IVth Corps is to hold the enemy engaged North of Tolmine and, when the opportunity offers, to attack Monte Mrzli and the other positions North cf Tclmtno.The plan of operations allows of the possibility of the action of several columns from different directions against the various strong points in the defences cf the Bainsizza plateau in turn,     These defences, moreover, have not been prepared with that lavish.construction of trenches and caverns as on the Carso, as the enemy does not appear, up tc the present, to have anticipated so strong an offensive from this quarter.   His defences, however, are very strong all the same and telephone interceptions shew that the officers feel confident *f,the strength of their positions,     These are
well supplied with machine-guns, are provided with a great deal of cover in the shape of tunnels and caverns for the troops and are well supported by the now rapidly increasing artillery on the plateau itself.Taking all the points into consideration^ it appears probable that more ground will be gained, especially at first, on the Bainsizza plateau than on the Carso..An interesting point is that an ingenious system of dams has been designed and constructed by a young civil engineer, for the purpose of diverting a large part of the Isonzo river into the bed of the Natisone river, so that, in case the Isonzo should be In flood at the moment of the offensive, the bridges to be made by the troops vjould not be endangered.     These dams are constructed near Caporetto, The secret has been well kept and until today it was supposed by everybody that some sort of railway or road was being constructed there.     The truth seems to have been unsuspected until hinted at in General Cappello&apos;s orders of tonight in which It is stated that &quot;at the time when the crossing will be made, it will probably be found that the water in the Isonzo river will have sensibly diminished&quot;. The calculations aimed at keeping the average depth of vrater In the Isonzo at about 80 cm.     Although the troops can wade in some places, it is necessary, all the same, to construct many bridges and 18 have been prepared   to be thrown across the river between Salcano (near Gorizia) and Selo, South of Santa Lucia,The Italian General Staff has taken the greatest possible care In working out all the preparations for the action.     General Gadorna himself has repeatedly lectured to the 10 Corps Commanders, who   will direct the offensive, with, a view to avoiding some of the mistakes which led to such heavy losses last May.       These were mainly ascribed to the lack of liaison between the artillery and the infantry, the insufficiency of cover in the communication trenches by which: the supports and reserves were brought up and the lack
of training of several of the young and inevitably inexperienced officers.     An enormous amount of work has been done in the construction of communication trenches 7- feet deep .ond actual tunnels in the solid rock on the Carso.The Italian aviation service has been expanded and, for the purposes of the offensive, SO aeroplanes have been allotted to each Army, while 70 nre kept in hand as a reserve under the Comando Supremo-,The flotilla of British and Italian monitors nor; carries six 12-inch, four 15-inch and twelve guns of about 8-inch calibre.     Those will co-operate at a selected moment during tho attack by bombarding from the sea.The heavy artillery ammunition at the disposal of General Cadorna is more than was expected, as, by the middle of August tho accumulation amounted to 3^ million rounds, Of these, General Cadorna means to put 1^ millions into reserve and use the remaining 2 millions for the offensive,     This is about 2-h times as much as was available during the offensive in May,     As the total strength of the Italian troops is also about double what it was then, it would appear that the blow which General Cadorna is now about to deliver should be at least twice as heavy as that of last May,It. is true that the front of attack is 30/* longer, but this, in view of the numerical superiority of the Italian forces will be to their advantage,&apos; as the enemy will find it difficult to defend so long a line.As regards the morale of the Italian forces, I cannot help thinking that the spirit of the troops is not quite so high as formerly, nor is the confidence as great as it should be in view of the obvious superiority of strength and the completeness of the preparations.     There can be little doubt that the pacifists and pro-Germans in the country have been very busily at work to depress morale and to Increase the impatience and war-weariness in the country.     This may be reflected in the morale of the Army,     It is a slight thing yet,but I think it does exist, although the officers state that as soon
as the troops are got away from the resting positions in rear and go up to the trenches, it disappears.There have been instances in one or two units of indiscipline and of refusal to obey orders amounting almost to mutiny.     At Farra, on the evening of August 14th., some of the Infantry of the XIth Corps shewed their discontent at being ordered up to the trenches again, sooner than they expected, by firing off their rifles and creating a disturbance. General Pettiti, Commanding the Corps, had the ring-leaders shot at once and order was restored.       The incident is significant and is not entirely isolated, though it would be a great exaggeration to draw general conclusions as to the discipline of the troops from it.       Needless to say that such unsatisfactory behaviour is quite unusual In the great body of the Italian army which, I feel confident, will fight steadilyenoughcThe publication of the PopeTs note to the belligerent powers, on the eve of the great offensive, might have had a very unfortunate effect as it was no doubt intended to do.     With the more ignorant men, the representations of the underminers of discipline - that what the Pope says must be true - might carry some weight, especially when it coincides with their own desires.     The Duke of Aosta told me tonight that he hid endeavoured to prevent the text of the Note and all references to it from reaching the troops by suppressing the newspapers in the zone of the Illrd Army just before the action.   It appeared, however, that this step was regarded as ultra vires and had to be cancelled..   The Duke was evidently concerned by the effect that might be produced by the Note and has increased his visits and addresses to the troops o.s much as possible in the l^st day or two in order to counteract the mischief.In the Ilnd Army it seemed to me, in an undefinable manneri that the spirit is higher and the confidence of the troops is greater.     This may be due to the fact that the men
S.of the lind Army feel that they have more chance of manoeuvring and fighting the enemy on equal terms.      The desperate frontal slogging attacks on the Carso have been so bloody hitherto that the troops of the Illrd Army may view the prospect with a little less cheerfulness.There is no doubt, too, that the country (though I believe really quite steady and determined, as a whole, to see the war out) is, at the moment, rather more war-weary than usual, thanks to the tireless efforts of the pro-Germans and pacifists, the absence of a great military success so far and the prospects of insufficient coal for their needs.     Consequently the Government is most anxious to obtain a success on a scale large enough to satisfy the people and to keep them quiet during the trying time of the winter, when the operations will all be on a small scale until the spring permits of the resumption of hostilities on a great one.It is also very desirable that the Italian army should have better and less precarious lines to rest unon during the winter.For all these reasons the success of the impending operations is of considerable importance, in addition to the predominant necessity for defeating the enemy and getting on with the war.Looking at the situation as a whole, there appears to be good reason for feeling confident that a very substantial success will be gained.     Apart from its numerical inferiority - compensated for though it is by the strength of its defensive positions -the inferior morale of part of the Austrian forces is a source of weakness.     There is no room for doubting that most of the troops are very anxious to stop fighting.
Comando Supremo Italy.The misery in the interior of the country is great and depresses the troops.   The Bohemians and seme other nationalities are more and more disaffected and may decline outright to fight, while Austrian officers in increasing numbers are shewing a disposition to enter into relations with the Italians.Consequently, in a week&apos;s time from now, the situation may shew a considerable change.(Signed)    C* DELME RADCLTFFE.Brigadier-General.
