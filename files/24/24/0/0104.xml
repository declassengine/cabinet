SECRET.&apos;     .   :. .        tTMs Document is the Property of G.T*-1900       His Bri^nnic Majesty1 s Government)WAR     C A S I H S f,WARIffgORMATION TO THE PHIKO!JIIHISTER OFjgHE OQWomfEALTH &apos;0g,,,A^jST^LiAT(Paraphrase of telegram from Governor-General of Australia to Secretary of State for Colonies).35714th August, 1917.My Prime Minister communicates following message: Secret.My telegram 23rd July requesting further information and your reply of 26th July.   Your fortnightly cable letter does not contain required information.   Although interesting it is too general.   While under present constitution it is of course a matter entirely for His Majesty1s Government to decide whether Dominion Governments should be kept informed of actual war position on land end sea I think it would assist Commonwealth Government materially to be informed of actual facts confidentially-.   Your fortnightly cable letters do not do this.   Por example, what is position as regards submarines?    What number has enemy?   At what rate is she building?   . What number has been certainly destroyed since beginning 6 iff indiscriminate submarining?   Is there any truth in statement that Germany is building 5,000 ton submarines, and if so how many per week or month?   Is she building fast cruisers, if so how many?    Does she propose with help of fleet to try and get these or/ and submarines through?   If so, when do you anticipate that the attempt will be made&apos;:   Again j while weekly losses of British ships are given nothing is said as to condition of those attacked but not sunk.   What effect, expressed in terms of weeks - tons, has this on vessels so incapacitated?     At whet rate are new merchant ships;   sub-marine destroyers;   being built in United Kingdom?   Is present rate of iosses of British mercantil$9a*n eenemy submarines taken in conjunction with rate of construction of new British tonnage and new enemy submarines considered Satisfactory by Admiralty?   That is, are we holding our own or not.   Then as to land campaign;   what are prospects on western front?   Is evacuation of Salonica decided on?   Is British Army in Mesopotamia in danger?   Is General Maude going to hold Baghdad or not?   What is actual food position of Britain?   What is her margin of safety particularly so far as concerns bread and meat?Answers to above would furnish kind of information which would-serve to guide and help Commonwealth very much indeed.   If you deem it inadvisable to supply information of this kind Commonwealth Government will not complain but ventures to suggest that it might be permitted to know what is actual position as its fate is as much involved as that of Britain and as it has dene and will continue to do itr utmost to ensure victory.FERGUSONo
