SECRET.Operations.Prom :   General Ballard, C . I. G . S .i;!;^&quot;^7^\^Repeated Petrograd. 20th August 1917,Wjj Handed in 10.40 p.m.Section 4. The battle of Ocna. The Germans, in order to tie the Roumanians down, developed a simultaneous attack with 5 divisions from the Oitus Pass towards Ocna. This was met by the 6th and 7th divisions of the Roumanian Second army. The Roumanians fell hack at first and the fighting has been of a give and (one group omitted) character. Casualties have been severe on both sides.5. Following German divisions engaged.218th Division defeated by Averescu.   At Maracesti the Germans attacked with 217th, 12th Bavarian, 89th, 76th reserve division, 216th and also 62nd Austrian.   They then brought up 109th, 115th and the Alpine Corps.    Of these the 89th, 76th and 216th have been practically wiped out.   All others have had heavy losses.   At Ocna they ?attacked with 7th and 8th Austrian Cavalry divisions., 15th Bavarian Reserve Brigade, 37th Austrian division, 70th Honved and units of 117th and 225th German divisions. 6.. Allied casualties.In Averescu attack 1,200 killed, 2,000 wounded. In battle Maracesti the 5th and 9th Roumanian divisions lost 6,000, 8th Russian Corps lias been reduced from 15,000 to 6,000.   7th Russian Corps now contains only 4,000 bayonets and has been w ithdr awn fr om the 1ine. 7.   . Present situation.  .Since August 14th fighting has slackened.   The enemy continues to make strong demonstration by Barrages and by surprise infantry attacks by night.     There has been no vital change in the (one group omitted) although these efforts havecaused
caused considerable casualties.   Prezan is now confidant that the situation is secure unless the Russians again give way in the north or the Germans bring up several new divisions, 8, I look upon these operations, especially the battleof Maracesti, as signal and remarkable victory for the Allies. Germans have practically used up 14 divisions without any appreciable gain, and without drawing Russian reserves from the north.     This shows that the Roumanians have been well trained by the French, and have put up a fine fight, and have contributed well to the allied cause.     Credit must be given also to 7th and 8th Russian Army Corps. &apos;I hope this victory will be recognised in England,   It must be remembered that the Roumanians were fighting under discouraging conditions:   German propagandists, have been suggesting a separate peace: * the news from Russia was alarming::   the civil population was in a state of panic.   The Roumanians are peculiarly sensitive;    they value the opinion of the British higher than that of other allies, and they look for appreciation from the British nation.   I have already suggested messages of encouragement and the award of decorations. I further suggest that the British Press might be given some of the above facts to work up into appreciative articles, I respectively suggest a reference in Parliament.,   A detailed account of the operations mentioned above will follow by next bag.
