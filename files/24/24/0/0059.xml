Commercial Committee of the.-House of Commons, who were desirous of discussing with hini&apos;his general policy in respect of supplies, prices, and distribution. - The-deputation was introduced by Sir Francis Lowe. Lord Rhondda expressed his desire to do everything in his power not only to maintain the food supplies of the country but to&apos; keep the prices as low as possible. He further declared his intention of utilising, so far as practicable, existing business machinery.&quot;Allied /Purchases - in -America:-Cablegrams have-been received from Lord Northclifle an.d:Mr. Hoover, pressing for- the &apos;early formation of a consolidated buying agency for meats and fats in the United States. ;a a  (33)3659-4   Pk 1   00   8/17   ESS AMINISTRY  OF  FOOD.
2Negotiations have been undertaken with Monsieur Clementel, and other French delegates, for the establishment, on the lines of the Wheat Executive, of an Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive to purchase meat, bacon, hams, lard, butter, cheese, and other articles as may be specified, on behalf of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, not only in America but elsewhere. An agreement has practically been reached and it is hoped to set up the Executive at an early date.At the same time arrangements have been discussed for setting up, as between France and the United Kingdom, an Oil Seed Executive to control the supplies and purchase of the oleaginous nuts and kernels and vegetable oils and fats both in British and French territories (from which the greater part are. produced) and from other countries.   This arrangement also is approaching completion.Resumption of Malting. The fdllowing scheme has been adopted for limiting and controlling the use of barley for this purpose : (1) If the authorised output of beer is allowed to continue until the autuirm of 1918 it will be necessary to permit the steeping of about 2,700,000 quarters of barley. All the malt required for use before November 30, 1918, must be made during the coming season, and all the barley must be steeped by May 31.(2). As the quantity of barley to be.steeped represents about 45 per cent, of the total quantity steeped during the season 1915-1916, maltsters will be licensed to make a corresponding percentage of the malt manufactured by them during that season. Monthly returns will be required showing the quantity of barley steeped and the stocks of malt in hand.(3) Licences will in the first instance only be issued to manufacture one-third of .the total quantity of malt in contemplation for the year ending September 30, 1918, and maltsters must apply for the renewal of their licences in November, 1917, and again in February, 1918.(4) Licences to brewers for the purchase and use of malt will provide that the total quantity each brewer is permitted to buy or use during a given period shall be reduced by deducting the total amount of sugar, maize, . and other malt substitutes used by him during such period.Rationing of Horses. In view of the request of the Director of Remounts to be provided with a reserve of riding horses in condition, the horses of hunt stalls have been granted a modified ration until the beginning of the hunting season, when, with all other hunters approved of as horses available for Army purposes, they will receive a ration of 10 lbs. per head. Horses allowed hunting rations will be in reality a part of the Army Remount Establishment, kept and Jed at the expense of their present owners, but liable to be called up at any time. No hunters other than these will, receive rations,.and the masters of hounds are under obligation to keep-a list of such horses for the inspection of the District Remount Officers and these horses will include those pertaining to the hunt staff. The Army requires a reserve of 6,000 horses, and it is estimated that this scheme should furnish about 5,000 of this number.In accordance with the Cabinet decision to allow a resumption of,racing, licences have been issued to about 110 trainers who have made application. About. 1,200 horses are named, but some 300 of these are either geldings or five-year-olds or above. As the season advances some of these will automatically fall out of training.Sugar. There have been no further losses of sugar from war risks during the period under review.The Commission, at the request of Mr. Hoover, has undertaken to discontinue, until further notice, all purchasing in the Cuban market-the American refiners having similarly undertaken to stand out of the market.The state of the markets has not enabled the.. Commission to make any large purchases recently; but 12,850 tons in various lots has been procured during the last week for delivery in September and October.Meat.-A draft of the Meat&apos; (Control) Order has been submitted to the Legal Adviser to the Department for revision and final form.Potatoes.-The Department is&apos;engaged.in working out the details for the fulfil-ment of the guarantee of 6Z. per ton to growers of 1917 main crop potatoes which comes into operation oh September 15.Milk. The draft of an Order to govern the winter prices of milk on the promised basis of a maximum price to farmers of Is. 8d. per gallon for contracts has been &apos; submitted to the Board of Agriculture. . . -
Butter._Conferences nave been held with a small number of &quot;leading men in thetrade to arrange a scheme for controlling imported butter and for fixing butter prices generally. The list of butter prices agreed to&quot; by the/trade has ceased to be effective, and action by the. Food Controller has become necessary.Bacon. There have been meetings with the trade on the subject of sending a mission to Denmark to secure supplies of Danish bacon, and the terms upon which the mission might&apos;negotiate, and arrangements have been made with the Treasury and Foreign Office on the subject. The question of wholesale and retail prices and improved methods of distribution have also been considered.Dried Fruits. Two meetings have been held of the Advisory Committee to settle final details of the scheme for purchasing dried fruits. A meeting of persons interested in the date trade has been held and arrangements have been made with the Army Contracts Department that all purchases of dried fruits, whether for civilian or Army purposes, shall be made through this Ministry.The Foreign Office has been consulted and has made final arrangements with the Greek Government under the Commercial Agreement of 1890, whereby a considerable reduction in the price of currants to the English consumer will be made. The India Office is endeavouring to arrange with Sir Percy Cox for the purchase of dates.Feeding Stuffs. The Egyptian Government has agreed to our proposal to purchase all the Egyptian cotton seed crop at the price about 25-30 per cent, below the market prices that were ruling before dealings on private account were prohibited. As a result of this purchase it is hoped to effect a considerable reduction to the price of cotton seed cake to the farmer. The Department is workingat a new Oils and Fats Order.OrganisationIt wras announced in the London Gazette of August 17 that the King had been pleased to appoint Captain Charles Bathurst, M.P., to be chairman of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply, in the room of Viscount Devonport, resigned.Additional Food Commissioners have been appointed as follows : . : District.

Roberts, Esq., M,.Inst.C.E., Inverness.The Ministry have received notification of the appointment of 845 Food Control Committees.Enforcement of Orders.Potatoes. The Southampton Police prosecuted a potato vendor on six charges for selling at illegal prices, and a fine of 100Z. was inflicted.The Huddersfield Police prosecuted, at the request of this Ministry, two of the chief wholesale potato dealers of that place for wholesale contraventions of the Potatoes 1916 Main Crop (Prices) Order (No. 2) 1917. The defendants pleaded guilty ; in one case the penalty was 32L and 11. IDs. costs., and in the other case 2QI. and 11. 5s. costs. The defence was that the potatoes had been, bought at illegal prices, and that, therefore, no great profits had been made, and the Justices appeared to be satisfied on this point.: It is hoped, that as a result of this case it will be possible, ultimately, to institute proceedings agaiust the farmers who sold to these firms. Meanwhile it may he noted that in .the case where the total penalty was 33Z. 5s. the admitted illegal profit was 313L The result of this and the previously reported decision at Carlisle can only be described as an incentive to profiteering.Meat [Sales) Order.-The Chief Constable, of Newport, Mon., was requested by this Ministry to prosecute several offenders against this Order. Twenty-six persons were convicted on the 15th August and fined 2Is. each.a 2
f4tPrice of. Milk. A Middlesbrough, farmer, was fined.501., and his manager 51. for selling milk, at a price in excess of that authorised.Public Meals.-The Westminster , City Council has -prosecuted several more restaurants for contravening the Orders.&apos; Pinolfs Restaurant was fined. 91. 3s.. Sugar (Domestic Preserving). Order-The Epping Justices have agreed to state a case in respect of their conviction under. Clause 5 of this Order of a person whose false representation -was made before the date of the Order. The opinion was indicated that the subsequent acceptance of the sugar made the precedent repre-sentation a continuing act. :&apos;   &apos;.&apos;    -&apos;, -Food Boarding Order, 1917.-A Kilmariiock farmer was fined 5V. with an alternative of 14 days&apos; imprisonment, for acquiring 2 cwts. of sugar in contravention of this Order.PART IT-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.There is little to record during the current week. It will he seen that the total import of principal foodstuffs is higher than that reached in the preceding week, hut this increase is more than accounted for by the comparatively large supplies of sugar., and cereals other than wheat. But for these this total wOukl he Tower than that of the previous week. The falling off in wheat and wheaten flour was anticipated. It should be noticed that the importation of oil-seeds and - oilcake is low as compared with the corresponding periods of 1916, Unfortunately the total imports of these taken together during the first seven months,of the present year are markedly less in weight than those of the same months of the previous year, oilcakes being a little higher while oilseeds have fallen off by 24 per cent.The wholesale prices of meat exhibit a slight decrease.-; .        Imports; &apos;The aggregate importation of the principal foods (Table A) last week was 273,000 tons, 20 per cent; more than the previous week, but below the high levels reached and maintained throughout July. The total for the first 33 weeks of this year has now passed, and is.1 per cent, above, the total for the corresponding period in 1910.The quantities of wheat and flour (112,000 tons), were 19,000 tons below last week and much lower than in recent weeks ; in fact lower than in any week since April 22-28th. On the other hand, the; amount of other cereals (barley, oats, and maize) has increased 32,000 tons over last -week, and is greater than at any time in recent months,; the total for the year, however, is still 10 per cent, below that for the first 33 weeks of 1916. ./ .J3eef was better than last week, hut still 11 per cent, below the-average- for, the year so far. . Only 917 tons of mutton were received.   ;More bacon was imported than in the previous week; in all 1-1-per cent, less bacon and hams have been imported this year than last.The imports of margarine, which have varied between 1,448 and 3,122 tons in the last two months, only amounted to 916 tons.last-week.Nearly 58,000 tons of sugar or glucose arrived, the greatest amount for very ;many weeks.Consumption of Meat.The supplies of meat to the markets of London Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool, continue to fluctuate week by week (Table B); the indications are that the July level will, he maintained in August.The numbers of fat cattle at 51 principal markets (Table C.) in Great Britain, have now for seven weeks exceeded the corresponding numbers in 1916. The number last week (15,933) is 2\ per cent, above that in the previous week and higher than in any week of July or June.The supply of fat sheep during the last seven weeks has been equal to that of the corresponding weeks last year; last week it was-3^ per cent, above the previous week, 4 per cent, below, the week ended August 1st, and above every week in June or July.The supply of fat pigs last week was&apos;20 per cent, more than in the previous week, but 17 per cent, below that in the week August 9th-15th last year.
Wholesale Prices . (Table D). . -After rising 10s. 6d. per quarter in a fortnight, barley has fallen 7s. 2d., and stands at 68s. lid.; there is no other change of. importance in the price of cereals.English JDeef has fallen Is. 6d. to 120s. per cwt. The fall has been uninterrupted, since June 27th, when the price was 141s.; before that date it had risen for 9 weeks from a minimum of Ills, on April 25th.English mutton has also fallen .6s. Qd. to 131s. per cwt. The fall has been nearly continuous, since the highest price, 179s., on May 30th. The price is now about the same as at the beginning of May. Argentine mutton has hardly changed in price for 15 weeks.Irish bacon ha^ risen again 4s., or 2\ per cent,, but Danish bacon is unchanged and Canadian has fallen 1 per cent. . &apos;Linseed cake has risen 41 per cent., and at 450s. is slightly above its previous maximum four weeks ago.Table A.
