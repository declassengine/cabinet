Weekly Report from the Ministry of Labour on the Labour Situation ,A number of serious strikes involving lar^e numbers of men are in progress.The most important of these is that of the Iron Ore Miners in Cumberland, the beginning of which was referred to in last week&apos;s report.    The dispute is in regard to a question of wages and involves 9,000 men.     The number oi men involved, large as it is, is not however a measure of its seriousness, as these mines are the most important iron ore mines in the country, and at the present time their production is essential to the output of Munitions.Every effort has been nr.de to bring about a settlement -Mr. &quot;Tolff of the Ministry of Ilunitions has twice visited Cumberland and a representative of the Ilinistry of Labour has al30 been on the spot, - but without result.     The men show signs of desiring to go back to vork, but their executive have taken up a very determined position, from which they can hardly withdraw without loss of prestige.The strike of Boilermakers on the Mersey which was last week reported as threatening, lias materialised.     The nen profess to have been expecting an award in regard to a contention which they raised, that an advance in wa&amp;ee&quot;received shortly before the national award to Boilermakers of April last should not have been merged in the latter award.     This plea was fully presented to the Committee on Production before the national award was- issued and the Society was informed by the Uinistry of Labour that the award could not be reheard until a reasonable time had elapsed,. The strike is illegal under the Lunitions Act and any payments in support of it from the Union1s funds prohibited, though the men are attempting to argue that they gave due notice of the dispute and that there was no reference to arbitration within 21 days.     The nen are however of a truculent disposition and are actively attempting to make the question a national one.     It will be remembered that they displayed a similar obstinaoy in July last when they refused for some time to return to work until the arbiters on the question of standard shi,)s had been appointed. On that occasion, however, they eventually ^ave way, and it is possible in the present instance that the. absence of strike pay will soon produce a more reasonable frame of mind,     in the meantime some ei^ht thousand nen are involved, and they have succeeded in brincinc out uost of the soldiers, who have been sent back to work on shipbuilding, and some of the foremen, -sections who on the previous occasion remained at work.Quite a number of other minor strikes of Boilermakers or rivetters have taken place, notably on the Clyde, at Pimdeo, in the Horth Eastern area, and at 3erby.There have been no important stoppages in the Coal mining Industry, though a lock-out Las taken piace in fjouth &quot;ales over a matter arising out of one of the recent strikes.     Certain employees at the Cynon Collierv are to be prosecuted for their conduct during this strike, and the   others accordingly held a pit-head meeting to discuss the natter.     This made thorn late for work and they were locked out by the management.     It is feared that this action may lead to sympathetic strikes in some of the adjoining collieries.The small strike of transport worksrs at Hull, referred to in last week&apos;s report as belli&quot;; due to discontent at a recentfor the week ending; August 22nd.I.
award, grew in importance until some 1,50.0 men were involved. Before the matter had readied really serious proportions, h f   however, the men were persuaded to return.to work pendingnegotiations. %; This result was chiefly due to the action of the Union officials.The mepi at the Crown Tube 7ork3,  /$dnesbury have now returned to work, having secured their point, in the resignation of the official whose treatment of a discharged soldier seeking reinstatement had oaused so much aa^or.     This settlement was very timely as there was a   possibility of sympathetic strikes taking ;.lace at neighbouring works.A strike of &quot;tippers&quot; which began on the 20th at the Barry Docks involves a somewhat important point.     The men are paid on a basis of tonnage, and they are di&amp;eontented owing to the diversion to other ports of coal, which is usually shipped from Barry.    This involves a considerable decrease in wages, and the tippers accordingly demand a fixed wa^e, -based on the tonnage of the year 1913, plus a 15/- War Bonus, but the men have refusec1 to accept this.A strike involving some thousands of workers employed in Boot factories, at llortliampton, be; an on the 13th and lasted some days.     ?he point involved was one of sorae importance, namely, payment of wa^es for Bank Holiday week, which was observed as a full weokTs holiday.     The matter has been referred to arbitration.II.   DISJOT23.The attention of the country lias been drawn to a threatened strike of Locomotive .^:r;ineers and Pirepen the possibility of which was referred to in thie report o  a fortnight ago.    Ab the various negotiations which have tazen place in connection with the men1s demands have been rally reported in the daily press, there is no need for repetition here.    The trouble was at bottom an attennt on the  )art of tue Locomotive La^ineers to steal a march on the H.U.B., and was principally engineered by Kr. Bronley.    A strike would have been caused on Tuesday night, had not a way out been found for the Union.Apart from this the most serious trouble is still to be expected from the coal miners, who are very restless in most parts of the country.Ho alteration has taken place a^on;- the 7est York3hi re Colliery surface workers who are claiming an eight hour day&quot; and other concessions.    notices which will affect 20,000 men are to be handec&apos; in.In Durham the men are impatient for a reply to their recent application for a 25$ advance in wages which is being considered by the Coal Owners&apos; Association.    A meeting of delegates representinr; men worilna in 55 collieries has decided to ballot on the cjiestion of a strike should a favourable reply not be received.In the Hottingham&quot;-perby Coalfield several dismtes threaten to result in stoppages of&quot; work and notices which will involve several thousand men are to bo handed in.The Scottish Colliery Lngine and Bpilermen met in Glasgow on Saturday and woro informed that their application for a :ar Bonus of a shilling a shift had been refused.     It wa3 therefore resolved to tender 14 days notice..This decision affeot3 the whole ox the Collieries and Shale works in Scotland, aid if carried out ICO,000 workers vail be involved.The Tar Office Cor, tracts JDe -artment has only one new case of dispute to report.     This affects all the &apos; ,&apos;ar Office Contractors in &quot; i;van, and notices have been tendered contraryto///i !
to the advice of the Trade Union officials. The position in the Jute Industry is unchange, and there is also a possibility of trouble in the Cutlery Trade, where a movement is on foot to force the employers to engage only Union Labour. Shipyard Labour Department has to report an increase in the number of disputes which have been in progress during the week. These amount to 87, of which the majority are of slight importance. Eight only of these involved stoppages of work and as many as twenty-seven have been settled. The Clyde and the Tyne are still the most disturbed areas, though the Mersey, South Wales and Barrow are also said to be very restless. An important demarcation dispute is in progress at Liverpool, between Shigwrights and Joiners.     Owing to the action of the Officials of the Shipyard Labour Department a Court of Enquiry has been set up, and has given its decision which was to have been referred to mass meetings of the men on Sunday last. Further details have not yet been received. The Ministry of Munitions reports twelve cases of dispute, three of which have been settled. The most important of the latter was an alleged case of victimisation at Messrs. Vickers, Weybridge. An Australian worker who had taken a prominent part in a recent dispute was to be transferred to unfamiliar work in a different establishment. The intervention of the Ministry succeeded in establishing the fact that there was no victimisation, and in persuading the firm to pay attention to the men&apos;s wishes in regard to his work. The most important of the other cases is due to dissatisfaction among the engineers in the Keighley district. They contend that certain local firms are not applying recent awards of the Committee on Production honestly, and threaten to strike unless these firms are compelled to comply with the award. Negotiations with a view to arbitration are in progress. Cases in which women have threatened to strike in order to enforce a demand for bonus as opposed to piece work, and men to strike, in order to prevent attempts at their replacement by women, are also reported. The Committee on Production heard fifteen arbitration cases during the past week, all of them in London, with the possible exception of a dispute as to the number of hours constituting a "full ordinary week", none of these was noteworthy.
llorth mast Coast,Barrow and Cumberland,III DIST?ICT REPORTS .The position on the Clyde is Unsettled &quot;but there is no indication of immediate trouble.   Interest has during the past week centred chiefly on the Stockholm question, and at home on the subject of the reinstatement of the Clyde deportees.   This latter came to a head in the early part of the week, when several of the shops at last agreed to down tools, unless Kirkwood and the others v/ere reinstated within ten days.   In the meantime  irkxvood was granted an interview with Mr. Churchill and was guaranteed work in a National,, Projectile factory, failing the reinstatement which Mr*V^&apos;: ; Churchill was prepared to suggest to his late employer. ICirkwood returned to Scotland in a defiant frame of mind, but during the week-end the situation underwent a complete change.   A meeting was held at which the deportees wereurged to accept the work offered by the Ministry of Munitions, ICirkwood and the others seem to have agreed to this, and on the succeeding day went to work.   The reasons for this volte face are not yet apparent, but a situation which has always had in it the. elements of serious trouble is thus definitely relieved.The Glasgow Trades Council which is an extremist body, has passed resolutions supporting representation at Stockholm, and calling upon the Labour Party to leave the coalition.   There has also been some agitation about the disproportionate representation of Labour on the local Pood Control Committee.A special conference of Scottish Miners17th which agreed to support Mr. Henderson!swas held policy.on the Mr,Smillie made an important statement, in the course of which he said that if the German representatives at Stockholm were to refuse the British terms, Labour would unite more strong-ly than ever in the prosecution of the Ttor,There is still some restlessness on the Tyne, due ohiefly to the recent engineering award, which is at present the most active cause of discontent in the engineering world, and to questions in regard to standard shij^.&apos;The main body of opinion is strongly &quot;against Stockholm a-jid the Durham Miners Association reversed the action of its Executive in voting in favour of representation.   The Northumbrian miners a^e demanding the resignation of their president and secretary, and branches of other Unions have passed resolutions condemning the action of their delegatesThe A.S.E., Elswick Branch, will not tolerate any peace in its proposals Germanyfs terms.    These terms shouldin supporting Mr. Henderson, paesed a resolution that they meeting that does not include full submission to the Allies&apos; include annexations and indemnities,171th the exception of the strike of Iron Ore miners referred to in Section I conditions are normal.The Barrow Shop Stewards have received an invitation to take part in a conference, which it is proposed to hold shortly at Leeds for the purpose of arranging a general strike on the question of the Engineering Award.   It is improbable that the men will be prepared for immediate measures of so drastic a description, as the holidays have exhausted their funds.An important meeting of engineers, which was held on the 19th, was addressed by Mr.   &apos;.C. Anderson, M.P., and was almost unanimously in favour of sending delegates to Stockholm.The Clyde &quot;and Scotland.
With the exception oi the Mersey district conditions in this area are normal. Discontent with the Engineering award continues hut there is no probability of immediate trouble.Agitation about the income tax is growing and has now crystallised into a proposal, put forward by the Liverpool Electrical Trades Union, that the basis should be raised from .2130 to  160.The important Shop Stewards conference which was held at Manchester during the week-end is referred to in Section V.The strike of Boilermakers on the Mersey is referred to in Section I.   The men are making every eff or t to bring out other Unions in sympathy, and a resolution to this effect was put before the Manchester Conference of Shop Stewards, but was negatived.In this district, (and the remark is true of the whole country in varying decrees), there is considerable resentment about the GovernmentTs treatment of Mr. Henderson, both among his supporters and opponents.   It is by many regarded as a slight to the labour movement.The general position in Yorkshire is more normal. Unrest continues among the textile workers, but no disposition to make immediate trouble is apparent, and interest centres in the newly established Board of Control.The agitation among the miners about Military Service has subsided, owing to the temporary withdrawal of the recruiting scheme, and the men&quot;are now all back at work.Interest has largely centred in the threatened strike of LocomotivG Engineers and Pirernen (referred to in Section II) as the Union has its headquarters in Leeds.    There is considerable bitterness between the members of this Union and the national Union of Railwaymen, and the trouble is locally regarded as largely due to a personal quarrel between Mr. Bromley, Secretary of the Engineers, and Mr,. Thomas.Midlands.       The position is on the whole quiet, though the dis-content among the Engineers continues, a,nd the majority of the Locomotive Engineers and firemen in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire were favourable to the proposed strike.Most of the Local Trades Councils have passed resolutions in favour of Mr. Hendersonrs Stockholm policy, bat neverthe-less the majority of workers, particularly among the miners, are strongly opposed to it.    There is however a disposition among the latter to resent the Governmentrs refusal of passports.Qadon, The position is normal.Various important meetings and Conferences have taken place in regard, to the Stockholm question but these have been fully reported in the daily press, as have also the delegate conferences of the Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, one oi which was attended by Mr, Barnes and Sir Albert Stanley.A meeting of the Leyton Branch of the I.L.P., was hold on the 15th at which 17.3?.Watson, who was very prominently identified with the recent Engineers&apos; strike&quot;, outlined his future course of action.   He said that he had given up his attempt to bring about the amalgamation of the Engineering, Metal and Shipbuilding Trades and intended to start a new Industrial Union of his own.   Luring his speech he expressed himself in favour of international action on the lines of the Industrial Workers of the 7orld, but it is not yet known that he has joined that dangerous organisation./ The^ashire and.eshire.rkshire.
The position in South &quot;Tales is decidedly quieter.The chief centres of unrest are at the moment the Barry Docks (referred to in Section I) and the collieries.An important meeting of seamen was held during the week at which a resolution was passed unanimously refusing to accept the yote given at the Labour Conference in regard to representation at Stockholm and demanding a referendum of the rank and file of Trade Unionists.The miners are however strongly in favour of Mr. Henderson1s policy and a resolution illustrative of their outlook was passed at a meeting of the Aberdare miners to the following effect:-&quot;In the opinion of this meeting an international meeting for consultation purposes such as was recommended by Mr. Arthur Henderson cannot possibly be of any harm, but rather that (1) the representatives of this country may place our position clearly before the Prussian Delegates and (2) that our representatives may tell the German delegates and say that plainly Germany is responsible for the war and that Germany alone is the stumbling block in the way of its settlement and that such a conference for such purposes should lead to very much good, and we therefore disapprove of the decision of the Government to refuse passports to the delegates and we desire that the Prime Minister should bring the matter forward again for consideration.&quot;
,1V. PH3SS OgTffiflgg7?Labour andPartylie question of the representation of the labour )lm&quot;   Party at the Stockholm Conference has again formed the te. v, / subject of voluminous articles in the daily and weeklyPress *   The effect of Iir, Eender-Monvs resignation from th .7ar Cabinet, on the relations between the Government and Labour generally, is the special subject of discussion in a number of journals.   The &quot;Hew Age&quot; \7rites:- &quot;The.^ious circumstances of Mr.Eender &quot;resignation under myste &quot;fronfthe Cabinet cannot be said to leave the Government &quot;unweakened in its hold upon Labour-   The1:1circumstances&quot;it is true, need further explanation than is offered.oB*c &quot;but on the face of them they appear highly suspicious: &quot;and they are likely to be deeply resented by the Labour &quot;movement&quot;*The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; sees in the incident a proof that the Labour Party was wrong in agreeing to be a party to the coalition Government and describes the situation of the Labour member of the War Cabinet as follows.. -&quot;.....el r.Lloyd George regarded Labour Ministers as &quot;hostages for the good behaviour of the working class a &quot;The treatment of Henderson by the prime Minister and his &quot;colleagues in the V7ar Cabinet, bears out the assumption &quot;referred to, for, aB soon as one of the hosoages ventured &quot;to differ with the Prime llinister, the offending hostage &quot;was treated, not as an equal, but as a lackey&quot;.Similarly the &quot;South &quot;vales Pioneer&quot; writes:-   &quot;In &quot;other words, Labour members-are in the Government as &quot;hostages for the good behaviour of the rank and file of &quot;the Labour movement.   Nobody can have any doubt on thjs &quot;point after what has happened during the last fortnight&quot;,The &quot;V/oolwich Pioneer&quot; refers to the treatment of Mr, Henderson as not only an insult to himself but also as an affront to Labour as a whole:-   &quot;An affront to the &quot;accredited representative of Labour is an affront to the &quot;whole movement.   It is not a quarrel between two men: &quot;is not a quarrel between the Premier and a colleague.

Yet we are now within &quot;sight of conditions in which such a rift might begin to &quot;form itself, and there are not wanting influences which &quot;will work their worst to create, and, when created, to &quot;widen it&quot;.It was to be expected that a demand would arise from the I.L.P.Section for the withdrawal of Labour support from the Government.   This demand is voiced in the &quot;Call&quot; among other papers.   &quot;IIr.Lloyd George1 s direct challenga &quot;to Labour, permits of but one answer... .*Ther*iI hall en go &quot;must be answered by the immediate withdrawal of gvo:;? &quot;Labour representative in the Government.....The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; writes in a similar strain;   &apos;*
Interest in these bodies has been diverted by the Stockholm incident, and references to them are comparatively few.   The &quot;Newcastle Daily Chronicle&quot; reports that the Miners Lodge of &quot;Jallsend G. Pit unanimously passed a resolution condemning the B;:ecutive, and demanding their resignation on the ground that they had sent representatives to a meeting of the Council.   She &quot;Herald&quot; described the impromptu meeting held at Glasgow, where the regular meeting had been prohibited, and emphasised the fact that no rioting or disorder had ensued.   The &quot;Call&quot; published a similar article.The &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; in a paragraph headed &quot;Soldiers&quot; and Sailorsr Conference&quot; attacks the Government in reference to the Southgate riot on the ground that they &quot;Have to some extent given their blessing to mob rule and &quot;mob violence against any section of society that are not &quot;of their way of thinking, oronot of Lord Horthcliffers way &quot;of thinking&quot;.kers and diers uncils.25SSS3lJteE Reference to the reports of the Whit ley Cub-Committee^ and of the Industrial Unrest Commissions have been frequentin the Press during the week.   As a rule the tone employed is one of approval, but the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; describes the proposals of the former as a &quot;co-partnership&quot;snare&quot;, while the &quot;Herald&quot; in a reference to a resolution passed by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation approving the National Alliance of Employers and Employed ventures &quot;to &quot;hope that recent developments in the political alliance &quot;between capital and labour will cause the Iron and Steel &quot;workers of the country to suspect that there is such a thing as being sold^or rather given away.&quot; Similar suspicions were voiced in a meeting of the 31apkburn and District Trades and Labour Council, which met in order to consider the proposals of the Whitley Sub-Committee (Blackburn Weekly Telegraph).The Reconstruction Ministry is welcomed in an article in the New Age&apos;, but unhesitatingly condemned by the Onllv ,    iShe &quot;Newcastle Daily Chronicle&quot; states that the Executive Committee of the British Socialist Party has addressed a manifesto to the Labour Conference., recommending that the Labour Party immediately withdraw its representatives&apos; from the Government and repudiate any who refuse to come out.The &quot;Herald&quot; has a long article entitled &quot;The Ohoioe for Labour&quot;, presenting what purports to be a history of the &quot;Stockholm Crisis&quot; and concluding with an appeal to Labour to support Mr. Henderson.   &quot;It is up to Labour to support him:&apos; &quot;to insist on going to Stockhoifcm: to refuse to wait on the &quot;Premier* s doormat&quot;*&quot;Common Sense&quot; suggests that the opposition to the Government on the Stockholm question is only a symptom of general discontent in the Labour world.   &quot;According to some &quot;accounts many of our industrial districts are seething with &quot;discontent, and Mr. Churchill^ sudden capitulation to &quot;Trade Union demands on the Munitions of T/ar Bill, coupled &quot;with the warning speeches of Mr. J.H.Thomas and other &quot;Labour leaders indicates that the situation is far more &quot;serious than a perusal of the London newspapers would &quot;suggest&quot;.The &quot;Clarion&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;British Citizen and Empire V/orker&quot; continue their opposition to participation in the Stockholm Conference in articles of no great force.
which sees in it a design.&quot;still more firmly to enslave &quot;the workers&quot;.cation She Education Bill is the subject of comment and ofcriticism in many papers.   The more moderate Labour journals of which the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; and the &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&quot; may be taken s,s typical, welcome the Bill as a substantial though inadequate measure of reform.   The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; says &quot;If this Bill be carried, it will not give us a complete and perfect system of education, but it will be the greatest advance towards that ideal which has been made by any one step in eduational reform&quot;.&quot;Justice&quot; in an article entitled &quot;Educational Skilly for the Workers&quot;, the &quot;Clarion&quot; and the &quot;Call&quot; at?e frankly hostile.   The &quot;Call&quot; considers that !lr. Wisher1 s convictions are excellent but that &quot;he has been dominated &quot;and kept in check by consideration for &quot;industry and the &quot;interests of the employing class&quot;.   The &quot;Clarion&quot; jeers at the meagre provision of hours for continuation education, and suggests the inadequacy to be due to a fear that anything more adequate would open the eyes of the ?/orking class, with dangerous results to the Capitalists   It demands that the number of hours per v/eek should, be 20, as proposed by the Workers1 Educational Association.There are signs of opposition to the abolition of half time in Lancashire from both employers and operatives. The latter are inclined to take the view that they must be -compensated by better wages for the lost earnings of the children.The agitation on the question of prices has largely died down, but the &quot;Leicester pioneer&quot; criticises the Corn Production Bill as a lineal descendant of the Corn Laws, while several papers animadvert on the continued rise in the price of meatc   The &quot;Labour Loader&quot; and the &quot;Call&quot; complain of delay in reduction of the price of bread.   In several quarters opposition to the ]?ood Control Committees is expressed, notably in the &quot;Herald&quot;, where recommendatoryfor appointments in Greenwich and Glasgow are severely criticised.The withdrawal of the Dilution clause in the Munitions of v/ar Amendment Bill has been vrelcomed by the whole Labour Press *   T e opposition of the Miners to further recruitment from&quot; their ranks is hailed with&apos; delight by the pacifist section,,   The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; in a paragraph headed &quot;Makes us Sad&quot; eoit-ments adversely on a resolution of the Yorkshire Itiners Association Council recommending that all the men who had gone into tho pits cinco August 1914 should be bombed out&quot;.noo&amp;.,.and&quot; mmm  I JOWpw0ervice.
inhere are a number of signs tending to show that the Shop Stewards movement is in difficulties, -particularly in regard to funds.   The Clyde Shop Stewards had not sufficient money in hand to pay the expenses of one of their delegates to the Manchester Conference and a levy was to be mace.   The fund for the maintenance oi the deportees also became exhausted with little prospect of replenishment, and this probably had a considerable influence on their decision to accept the offer of employment made to them by the Minister of Munitions. (See Part III. ) The &quot;Herald,f is still appealing, apparently without success, for subscriptions to pay off the^legal expenses incurred by the men arrested during the Engineers1 strike, while the strike comroittee elected at that time has been dissolved, leaving a debt of  1*7,Moreover, the movement in favour of amalgamation in which W.      Watson was the principal figure, lias broken down, and the Amalgamation Committee has been dissolved. V/atson, himself, is believed to be on the point of joining the Industrial Workers of the   or-ld, a much more dangerous body, phose history and methods were noticed in the Report for the week ending  aguet 1st,   The conference held, in Manchester on the 19th and 20th August appears to have boon largely a fiasco.   A division made itself apparent on the aims of the movement, one party being in favour of maintaining the Craft Union spirit and supporting Trade Union methods, while the other aimed at complete industrial unionism and revolution.   A motion in favour of a general strike of Engineers in the event of the last award of 5/- not being increased was defeated, as was a further resolution to strike in sympathy of the Boilermakers of Liverpool.    There was a sharp division of opinion also on the subject of the Stockholm Conference and at one time the proceedings became so stormy that a free fight seemed imminent.The above indications seem to suggest that the more advanced section of the movement is losing its hold and that the time ha3 now come &quot;/hen it can be more easily diverted into constitutional channels.   This is no doubt due largely to the fact that the general causes of unrest have to some extent been diminished, thereby weakening the following of the extreme element.   On the other hand, there are some signs that the Executive of the A.3.IB.are more inclined to consider the more.reasonable proposals of the Shop Stewards than they pave been hitherto, and the Secretary, Mr. E. Young, has written a rather notable article in their monthly journal for August, in which he somewhat cautiously pronounces in favour of the principle of amalgamation with other bodies in the trade.   The formation of a representative Advisory Committee to the Ministry of Munitions by Mr. Churchill may considerably help to improve the relations between the different Unions in the Engineering trade, and his proposal that one of their first duties should, be to work out a scheme for Shop Committees may be the first step towards bringing the sound element in the Shop Stewards1 Movement into the constitutional camp.OIF LABQUP.S        -i rT    &apos; .   o   *   jl / .
