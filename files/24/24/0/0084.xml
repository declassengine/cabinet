O    5V. -/ /SECRET-Intelligence Bureau.Department of Information. BAW/014.Weekly Report on Auafcria-Hungary. Xiy.The Austrian Cabinet Crisis.The failure of Dr. von Seidler to form a Parliamentary Cabinet is significant.     It is openly admitted in Austria that the Czechs are determined to settle their national problem at the Peace Congress and not in the Austrian Parliament, and therefore refuse all share in an Austrian Parliament, because that v/ould imply acquiescence in the existence of an Austrian State.     Un-questionably when making the endorsement of their programme of a Czecho-Slovak State the conditio sine qua&apos;non of their joining the government, they clearly knew that they were asking tfhat was not in the power of the Austrian government to concede.     So did the Jugo-Slavs when, after some hesitation, they insisted on similar demands for their own nation.Yet even without the Slav bloc * the Czechs, Jugo-Slavs and Ruthenes - a compact government majority could be obtained in Parliament if all the German parties and the Poles agreed jointly to take office.     Even this however proved impossible.     The German bourgeois parties and the Austrian State differ too widely from the. German-speaking Social Democrats in social theories and practice for regular co-operation between them to be possible.Although the aspirations of the Poles transcend the borders of Austria as much as do those of the Czechs and Jugo-Slave, yet these can be brought into consonance with Kabsburg interests.     ThePoles may oppose Austrian Cabinets or policies but they do noteo-^letedesire theAbreak-up of the Kabsburg Monarchy.     &quot;So you go into opposition?&quot; said on one occasion the late Auotrian Jitoperor to the
then leader of the Polish Club, M. de Bilinski.     &quot;To your O-aisterG, Sire,&quot;was the answer, &quot;never to the Throne&quot; - a distinction which is rare in Austria and has to be emphasised frhere it exists.     If the Poles now refused to join in forming a Parliamentary government, that was because Seidler has failed to satisfy even the minimum of their demands (proper payment of war damages and for requisitions in Galicia, more considerate treatment of that province in food matters, the handing back by the military of the government of Galicia to the Polish civilian authorities).     They must also have felt the indecency of joining a government in which up to the time wh3fl they had to decide on their course, none but the German Fationaliste had accepted office.     Lastly, if there is to be a weak government which does not include all the big parties, it is by far more profitable to remain outside than to have one or two representatives in it and for that reason be passed over in the doling out of loaves and fishes.]?or that is what is coming again, and the Heue ffreie Presse blurts it out with its usual cymical effrontery: &quot;It will be possible to find a majority in the House because events, have proved that the political parties thenoelves stand in urgent need of the State and must therefore beware of paralysing it.     In the course of the last few weeks      milliard crowns have been procured for the population by means of Parliamentary votes.     The House cannot abandon its work for the public welfare.&quot;    The miracle of a Parliament procuring money from a government for the population is a peculiar achievement of that &quot;institute for political corruption&quot; the Austrian Parliament.     &quot;The government composed of officials appointed by the Emperor,&apos;&quot; writes Mr. H. Wickham Steed in his book on &quot;The Eabsburg Monarchy&quot;, &quot;purchases majorities by concessions to the interests which parties represent or which individual party leaders wish&apos;to further.     Railways, canals, bridges, tobacco licenses for constituents, government appointments for proteges
and a hundred other objects of local or individual solicitude form the object of the ^unhandel1 constantly carried on between an iuatrlan Cabinet and the members not only of its majority, but also of the opposition.&quot;Although-it was certain on August 7 that in view of the refusal of the Poles to join the government the idea of a parliamentary. Cabinet would have to be abandoned, and although it was given out in the Press that the present government con-eisting of civil servants would be reconstructed and made permanent, no news has so far reached ue of this having been done.     And this seems the more surprising as Parliament is to meet again about the middle of September.The, Hungarian Cabinet Crisis.At the special request of the Emperor Dr. Wekerle takes over the Cabinet &apos;bf Count Esterhazy as recently re-constructed without any further changes in it.     The ffeue Preie Pres.se, which is always worth watching as the hired mouthpiece of Berlin, shows grief at Count Andrassy1s not having been appointed Premier.A lingering crisis had gone on within the Hungarian Cabinet; the Right favouring compromise over the electoral reform with Tissa&apos;s party, the extreme Left opposing it and pressin/-; for a general election.     But obviously this was not the cause of Esterhazyfs resignation, seeing the Cabinet remains in existence. Perhaps lister hazy is really ill, or perhaps he felt that the task exceeded his strangth and therefore made room for one of the old statesmen (V/ekerle is almost seventy years old and besides serving in different Cabinets has previously been Prime Minister three times).Still, even though the Cabinet remains unchanged, Y/ekerle^ appointment may be taken ao a move towards Tisza.     \7ekerle has taken no part in the wild attacks which Y/ere delivered against him by the opposition during the last year of his Premiership,
and both on deaaeBtic problems and in foreign affaire, there ie hardly any difference between these two men; they differ merely in temperament.     Lastly, the appointment of Y/ekerle has obviated the appointment of Andrassy or Apponvi which would have been a personal challenge to Tioza.Tisza and wekerle represent Magyar policy in its most perfect and most brazen form.     Andrassy on the other hand lias personal hobbies and idiosyncrasies (e.g. his interest in the Polioh Question exceeds the limits set to it by Magyar interests and for concessions in that direction he seems prepared to pay Germany heavily in matters concerning Central Europe).Comment on the Speeches of Lord Robert Cecil and the Prime Minister at the Luncheon given to M. Pasi6*The Heue Preie Presse seems embarrassed, tries to say as little about these speeches as possible, explains them as duo to dis- . appointment in England at the fact that Austria-Hungary does not -want to desert Germany, and goes in for surprisingly little of its Usual bombastic vituperation.     But the Premdenblatt, the organ of the Austrian foreign Office, publishes on August 10 an article of three columns which reads as if that paper had borrowed a leader-writer from the Neue ffreie Presse.     It - is full of clumsy irony, strained humour and-silly distortions.     The following sentence is typical: &quot;King Edward shrank from acknowledging Peter Karageorgevich as ruler of Serbia, but now M. Pasic is guest of honour of the British government and the murder at Sarajevo is glorified by Mr. Lloyd George as the deed whereby 1 civilisation accepted the challenge of Prussian terrorism^&quot; The heading which the Reichspost give^ to its abuse is &quot;New Bawling3 in London against Peace&quot;, that ef the Pester Lloyd &quot;The Humiliation of England&quot;,     It is significant that the two papers most intimately connected with the clique of the new Emperor, the Premdenblatt and the Reichspost, should have been so abusive
whilst the Neue ffreie Presse, whose relations with Berlin no one doubts, persists in sweet and grieved pacifism. The Pope1s Peace Note.The Pope!s Peace Note naturally caused a new effusion of eloquence on the part of the Jews of the Ifeue Preie presse.     The concluding paragraph of its leader of August 21 may he quoted as a sample: &quot;The few neutral States which remain in Europe were much more shy and shrank from approaching the ministers of the Entente with unwelcome proposals of peace.     The Pope has no such qualms, and he has compelled the Entente, which is already raging against him without any sufficient reason, to face the question of p3ace.    Again the cry goes through the land: !Ecce Homo J1 The Entente will crucify him.     Or is that merely pretence? Perhaps. &quot;Another article in the same issue of the ffeue Preie Presae explains in more matter-of-fact terms the viev/ which the Central European Powers take of the Hcte:&quot;In the first place one may note that the Pope&apos;s Note meets -with a most sympathetic reception amongst us as well as in Germany. It is permeated b  a spirit of the purest philanthropy and un-selfish neutrality............&quot;The concrete proposals of the Peace Note deal with gradual disarmament, the creation of an international court of arbitration, the freedom of the seas, and that which goes with it, the freedom of commerce, and lastly with a mutual restitution of occupied districts.&quot;These proposals are undoubtedly suitable as the basis for approaching peace.     It is true their realisation implies the destruction of the English dominion of the seas and the&quot; doing away with England1a naval bases in all &quot;the seas, Gibraltar, Malta, the Suez Canal, etc.&quot;Should it be impossible to reach an understanding on the basis of these proposals other ways will have to be sought to
safeguard the future of Auetria-Hungary.*    The article goes on to point out that although the Pope speaks about settling the territorial differences between Austria and Italy, and Germany and France, he doeo not say &apos;*that theee territorial aspirations should be satisfied&quot;.L-B.2ST-.29th August, 1917
