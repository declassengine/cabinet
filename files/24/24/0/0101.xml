/ThlsJDocument is the Property of^ 2   JHislritanniC Majesiy^jQ^^340REPORT relating to the war Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the week ending 29th August, 1917.FOOD PRODUCTION. Agricultural Work.During the Week the weather hae been generally unfavourable for harvest operations in the country.   In practically every county grain is ready to be cut but the heavy rains and strong winds that have been prevalent during the past week have not only prevented operations but have also laid great areas of grain crops.1. District Agricultural Committees.During the week a representative of the Board met the Com-mittees of Dumfries, Lockerbie. Annan and Thornhill, and he also had conferences with the Executive Officers of Wigtownshire.2. Compulsory Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M.The Board have issued two Orders under 2 M. intimating their intention to enter on parts of the Deer Forests of (a) fiileanreach, Glenelg, Inverness-shire, and (b) Attadale, Loohcarron, Roes-shire, and thereafter to let the land for graElng purposes in the interests of increased food production.3. Labour : Soldiers.Considerable numbers of soldiers are at present giving assistance in harvesting operations in Scotland.   In addition to 1250 men who were released in Spring for farm work and subsequently allowed to remain on the land, about 600 ekilled men have been granted agricultural furlough; 3000 men have been obtained specially for harvest work; 956 have already been released from the Home forces to oope with the increased cultivation forthe 1918 crop, and almost all the Agricultural Battalions (about 75CrjTn all) are now working on the land.   It would thus appear that approximately 6550 soldierB are at present available for farm work and, from reports received, a further 1500 will be required to cover all applications from farmers.The Board regret to report that the majority of the soldiers who have reoently been made available for agricultural work are entirely inexperienced and unskilled.   In view of assurances given regarding labour, farmers expected more qualified men for harvest work and are consequently disappointed with the labour supplied.
