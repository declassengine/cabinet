(This Document is the Property of!ls Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)BOAHD OP AGRXC,uXTt^.,,AM^^.SB^X59. Report for week ended 29th August ..JL917/ j 341Statistical Branch.The Preliminary Statement of the annual agricultural returns was issued on the 25th August.    Wheat is about the same acreage as last year, barley is 128,000 acres more, oats 173,000 acres more, and potatoes (excluding those grown on allotments) 80 acre3 more.     The total arable area is greater by 195,000 acres.     The increase in corn and potatoes is chiefly at the expense of permanent grass which declined by 187,000 acres, of the clover area, which fell by 91,000, and bare fallow, which fell by 67,000 acres. The total hay area is down by nearly 108,000 acres.     Cattle slightly increased, and are the highest on record;   milch cows (including those in oalf) are also higher than last year.     Sheep fell by 781,000 owing chiefly to a bad lambing season, and pigs are also down by a quarter of a million.The work of copying the main items cn the schedules cf farms cf over 20 acres, for the use of the V/ar Executive Committees, has also been completed, a large staff of members of the Stock Exchange doing this work under the supervision of this Branch.A circular was sent to all hop growers to ascertain, for the purpose of carrying out the Hop Orders, whether all growers had reduced their acreage to half the 1914   area.P i she r ie s. Division.There has been a heavy correspondence connected with applications for relaxations of fishing restrictions round the coasts.A draft of an Order to allow motor fishing boats to fish in Gardigan Bay has been sent to the Lancashire and Western Committee for an expression of their views,     A similar Order for the North East Coast is in draft.The Board have felt compelled to refuse to allow a byelaw extending the fishing season for salmon nets in the sea in the Tyne Fishery District.     The national food situation does not warrant a drastic interference with protective salmon regulations, and the fish are admittedly not in good condition,Byelaw matters in other districts have been dealt with. Questions affecting the means adopted for the quarantine of mussels taken in polluted waters have been considered in connection with the Conway and Gardigan Bay Mussel Orders.Correspondence connected with ordinary administrative duties has been unusually heavy.     The work is accumulating and application will be made for sanction to the appointment of a temporary inspector to deal with salmon and freshwater fishery matters.Permits Section.Permits have been granted to 35 fishing vessels, mostly for herring fishing off the North East Coast.
Arrangements have been made for an extension to the North West Coast of the system of permits for amateur fishing.Motor Loan Section.Several vessels have run their trials during the past week and further installations are nearing completion.The owner of the first  essingland motor beach boat, in which a 6 H*P. Petter engine has been installed by the Committee, distinguished himself last week by saving the lives of four soldiers who had lost control of their boat and been driven out to sea. Without the motor in it the Kessingland beat would have been unable to put cut to sea or to rescue the men^ for the soldierof boat was rapidly nearing a patch of very dangerous breaking water.This is the second loan   boat which has rescued men from boats at sea.Pish PSod. Section.Arrangements are being made to deal with any gluts that may occur in the   herring fishery on the East Coast, and officers have gone to Lowestoft for the purpose.The question of wood for fish boxes is being investigated further, and it is hoped that a supply of &quot;short ends&quot; nov/ in the hands of the Government buyer may be procured for the purpose.Enquiries are also being made to supply the shortage of hard wood turnings for the fish curers, and some further sources of supply have been found, \Fishermen&apos;a Registration andt fteoruiting Section.lifiJ^^Sa^l^^My^Serjrice.The examination of Naval records in the case of men whose enrolment was doubtful has been completed, but has left a csnsider-able number of men unaccounted for. Efforts will be made to traoe these and secure them for service.The selection of drafts for naval service is proceeding according to plan, but, owing to the diminishing reserves of men, this becomes more difficult and complicated as time g^es on, involving considerable correspondence and enquiry.Fishermen, Pish Trade and Military,, Service.Correspondence in this Department is also increasing, and more appeal forms are being received.     The temporary release of oertain men from Army Units to assist in the fisheries at speoial seasons has been secured.     The proposal for a general scheme baoed upon the requirements of various districts is being developed in co-operation with the National Pish Trades Association,
Potato.Disease.Wart Disease of Potatoes continues to &quot;be reported from many parts of England, some of which have never &quot;been reported as infected &quot;before.     Disease is reported from Bushey Heath near Watford, from Taunton, and frcm Plymouth,     Suspicious cases have also been reported from Ipswich, Rugby and Leighton Buzzard.Progress is being made with the arrangements for the supply of seed of immune varieties for next season, so that crops of potatoes may be obtained from land known to be infected with Wart Disease,H*ps.Preliminary meetings of the Hop Control Committee have been held, mainly for the purpose of taking stock of the position and for considering methods of procedure.     A Secretary will shortly be appointed.The Returns of hep growers of their acreages in 1914 and in 1917 have now been reeeived, and the operation of the Hop Order of 19th May, which required growers to reduce their acreage this year to one-half of what it was in 1914 is thus being ohecked. Enquiries with the same object are also being made in the hop districts.     Growers who do not comply with the Order will be liable to have their hops refused by the Control Committee or to be prosecuted for their non-cSmplianee.Corn Production. Act.Arrangements are being made for the staff and accommodation &amp;f the Agricultural Wages 2oard.     A letter has also been addressed to the Lands and Duildings Branch of the War Office and Ministry of Munitions claiming that the building in Whitehall Place known as Armament Buildings, which was designed for the accommodation of the Board ef Agriculture and Fisheries and is now occupied by the Ministry of Munitions, should &quot;fee handed over to this Board at the earliest possible date after the end of the war.     Very great inconvenience, waste of time, and hindrance to the work of the Board is caused by the inadequate and soattered premises in which the staff is at present housed. yf31st August, 1917,3,
