From ;i* dsnfefal fieime gadHiftejItaly *War? Of fide, 27,8 j 191? ,Handed in 6,50 Pt^i3f30, 86thi   Situation to-night 10 p,m,Bnd Army, 27th Gprps is meeting with strong opposition from troops which have been brought from. TQlmino against completion of its occupation of the heights north and east- of Kal,   It ha  occupied in force Lorn di Tolmino and Lorn di Canale * and will attack heights as soon as sufficient heavy artillery can be brought up j probably tomorrow ,   Monte Volhik was taken to-rday and 24th Oprps is advancing towards Ohiappvanp village and the edge of the valley soUth of it,   Northwest of Sail Gabrielsj Veliki Krib (point 526) has been captured and Italian troops are close round on the&apos;north-east side,   Italian fiavalry have Occupied Ravnioat     Enemy still offering considerable resistance.! chiefly with machine-guns on San Gabrieie, but extensive fires, have been seen all last night and tor-day,&apos; which are believed tp be due to Austrians burning the wood used in their trenches and hutments.,     At several points on plateau towards Tar nova extensive fires were also observed,   Heavy artillery is being pushed up tp Bainsizza plateau by all available roads with the utmost despatch, Roads are being added to and improved as much as possible, and in addition to resources of army units 5,000 labourers and \b companies of Engineers have been set to work to&apos;increase and improve roads. Orders have been given to carry a branch of the Gormens * Gorizia railway along the right bank pf the Isonzo from Lucinioo to the south-east end of Sabotine, connecting there with the old railway which is. to be put immediately in wooing order up %o as near1 Tolriiino as possible,It hag been stated by a captured.officer of 22nd Schutzen Regiment that orders for the Austrian troops were to retire to a line&quot; from 7,verenz Ternova HemeI luzna and Kobilek,   This line has only very slight defences marked out at present, but Is continued further south on a prepared line through San Miohele Qssegliano Ortavi &apos; VagarskQ Ravacina to the Tr(cue group undecipherable)lj Stol line,   It was stated by the same officer that no reserves are available, that the morale of the troops was. bad. and that if strong pressure is applied line indicated cannot be held, Meanwhile, there have been left along the western edge of the Chiapovano valley a number of rearguard detachments formed almost entirely by the 43rd Division to delay Italian advance as much, as possible,   It has been reported by aeroplanes that there is no indication of frosh arrivals of troops by road or train, In both directions between Chiapovanc Lokve and Ternova there is considerable local movement on the roads.     There is still uncertainty as to exact position of 10th Division with&apos;which contact reported in my telegram 338 August 23rd., but it is believed that it is on the east side of Chiapovano valley, A further 35 officers and 1,400 men, all of known units, have been captured,     It is stated, by prisoners taken on the Vertoibizza that orders were given on August 24 h that the heavy artillery was to be withdrawn and        field artillery still left in line.Pending
2.pending completion of operations San G-abriele and San Daniele attack on San Marco is delayed.    1st Division cavalry has now alas been moved up to join 2nd Division at Farra.     Cavalry brigade was engaged during advance- across Bainsizza plateau and suffered sins loss.     As usual Italian aeroplanes have been very active; bombing read centres in Chiapovano valley and railways etc.     Only two have been lost since the beginning of the offensive;    one was burnt on Monte Sabotin3 and *n$ brought down in flames in Chiapovanc valley.     There is no truth in Austrian statement as to Italian aeroplane losses.3rd Army.     Situation unchanged.     Relief of brigades in first line completed.     Various moves forward of heavy artillery ordered, and immediately after or simultaneously with attack on San Marco the offensive on the Carso will probably recommence. Considerable depression amongst Austrian troops is reported. 30th March battalions are now being absorbed but there is no hint of arrival of further reinforcements.     Feather is cooler but still fine.     This morning there was heavy rain which was a godsend to the troops on the Bainsizza&apos; plate3.u.s
