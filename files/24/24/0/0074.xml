Employment Exclianges.The Government is, I think, landed in a real difficulty by the existence of a Minister of National Service, independent of and side by side with a Minister of Labour.I do not myself believe that a Ministry of Labour will be found to be a permanent part of our organisation and that many of those who wanted it most are already realising that a &quot; class &quot; office of this kind is unsatisfactory. It is a mistake, they would say, to separate the affairs of labour from those of other partners in industry. Why not a Ministry of Employers or of: Capital? The Board of Trade separated from labour questions might become more and more representative of purely capitalist views ; that it cannot divorce itself entirely from labour interests is shown by its paramount share in the late railway trouble. Finally, a Ministry of Labour depends really for its existence on the assumption that a representative Trades Unionist will be willing to become a member of all future Governments. The real Ministry of the future is, I submit, a Ministry of Industry or Production dealing with employers and employed.But this does not mean of course that the functions of the present Ministry of Labour should be curtailed. On the contrary, the Ministry I foreshadow will have added functions, and certainly the present Ministry should be developed consistently with [this view if its power to deal, with all labour questions is to be increased. - 1 find myself in emphatic substantial agreement with the resolution quoted by the new Mmister of Labour.It is, I think, a blot on the organisation of government that when a Ministry of Labour is set up, and even after it has had eight months to find itself, the Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, and. War Office still have their labour departments working independently, and often at cross purposes, just as if a Ministry of Labour did not exist.As for the Ministry of National Service, I would remind the Cabinet that this Ministry was devised in its present form, that is, for civil as well as military purposes, by General Macready, Sir A. Geddes, Mr. Long, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Chamberlain and myself when no Ministry of Labour existed. The Ministry in its complete form has now come into existence much as we suggested last December, but the territory is now occupied by the Ministry of Labour, and the two departments naturally come into contact about Employment Exchanges, which, originally under the Board of Trade, for a long time more or less part of the Ministry of Munitions, have found a temporary home in the Labour Ministry.Mr. Roberts&apos; arguments are very strong, and I would supplement them with one other. It is obvious that the Ministry of Labour must be the right office to have a predominant part at least in demobilisation. They cannot make their preparations if they are shorn of the Employment Exchanges. I would also add that the limitation of functions of the Ministry of Labour has already caused hostile critics to suggest that the Government was not in earnest in creating it. Its friends are demanding increased powers for it; the Government will indeed irritate them, and cause jubilation among the critics if it curtails and limits when it is asked to expand.The right thing to do, I would submit with emphasis, is to put National Service in its proper place as a branch of the Ministry of Labour, then it will have the use of the Employment Exchanges without tearing them from their proper function of common service in order to make them the instrument of a temporary office.It will then, I hope, be found at the end of the war, if and when a -Ministry of Industry or Production is wanted, that the Ministry of Labour has been supplying industry and the army with its man power during the war.2Gth August 1917.E.
