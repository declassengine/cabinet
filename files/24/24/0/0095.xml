&quot;REPORT mm TEE IIINISTBY 0? LABOUR ON HE IdBOUR-SIgU^nOIITHE -/SSS EflDIHG AUGUST gjgfrh.&quot; Section 1 *- Strikes.&apos; &apos;, * A^The immediate position as regards strikes has improved during the week, and there are at present no strikes of any gre^t//importance in progress. Host of the actual stoppages stjil/ continuing and affecting considerable numbers of men are ^e^oVted from the South Wales Coalfield, i/c the IlanhiJlethBAb^flglliery, Newport 1500 men are involved owing to a demand lor -^^^the reinstatement of a haulier whose lamp had been &quot;stopped&quot;.Strikes due to disputes over the minimum wage are taking place at the Gwaen Cae Gurwen &quot;Colliery, and at the Maritime and Penrhyw&quot;Collieries at Pohtyipridd; in the latter some 700 men are involved. - .&apos;The Boilermakers Strike at Liverpool referred to in last week*s report, has come to an end and most of the men are by now back at work.   During the earlier part of the week the position increased in seriousness owing to the fact that resolutions in favour of assisting the Boilermakers were passed by the Liverpool Branch of the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades, and also by the local branch of the Electrical Trades Union.   This very materially assisted in keeping up the enthusiasm of the, Boilermakers which had begun to cool under rebuffs from the Lanchester Conference of Shop Stewards and other bodies.   The attitude of both Unions was probably largely due to the action of W. H. Citrinewho is prominently identified with both bodies. He is a man of extreme views, aad some influence. The Executive Council who were evidently anxious to find a way out of an impossible position, asked the Ministry of Labour whether assuming that the award could not be reopened they could raise a new issue on their agreement with employers as to their basis wage.   It was agreed that this was a new dispute and arbitration was accordingly arranged,, though no court is likely to accept the men?s contention.On Sunday a mass meeting attended by about 2500 men wa3 held, at which the officers of the local society Kessrs.J.7. Bell and Godsell^.who have both been very prominent in supporting the strike, p;ave an account of their negotiations with the llnistry of Labour.   It was stated that arbitration had been offered on condition that the strikers returned to work.-   This was claimed as a success, due to the support promised by the Electrical Trades Union, and the men were advised to return to work.   On a vote being taken 1309 favoured resumption and 856 epposed it.   This comparatively small majority indicates that the extremists hatfe a great deal of influence and that the situation may continue to cause anxiety.The serious strike of iron-ore I-Iiners in Cirmberlahdf which was also referred to in last week1 s report&quot;came to an ending during the week and the men have returned to work.   An agreement has been signed between the linister of Kunitions. and the local Trades Association by which the members of the latter are guaranteed certain pecuniary advantages.   They on their part accept the offer as a full settlement of all outstanding demands and undertake to do all in their power to increase the output.   Any difficulties arising under this agreement, which is to run until the end of 1918 or the end of the war, which every period is shorter, are to be
. referred to the Ministry of labour for arbitration.Several important-strikes of colliery workers have been settled during the week-.   One of these, which took place at Ttoystpn, Barnsley, and involved about 1000 men, arose out of a dispute regarding the recruiting of miners &amp;   Another was that at Creharris (the Ocean Colliery Company.) which &quot;Involved 2000 men and was due to allegations as to an insufficient supply of timber-, defective lamps, and the refusal of the management to meet the wishes of the miners in regard to a medical scheme.
Section II. Disputes.The settlement with the Locomotive ^np;inoers and Firemen has on tho whole been favourably TeceivecT^ but the men apparently regard Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s promise to give consideration after the war to their demand for an eight-hour day as tantamount to a promise to accede to the demand. &apos; Signs are not wanting that the agitation in favour of an eight-hot *v day is likely to spread to other industries.Little alteration has been reported in the position as regards tho various disputes in the coal mining industry referred to in last weckTs report.   In addition to &quot;these&quot;&quot;there is a possibility of now trouble in various parts of the country.   Tho -Colliery Examiners in South Wales held a meeting on the 25th and resolutions In regard &quot;Ho&quot;arTadvance in wages and recognition of their Trade Union was passed.   An &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; were in favour of tendering notices in order to enforce iheir demands. The South,Staffordshire and Worcestershire Miners have handed in notices which expire on Saturday &quot;neift.&quot; ThcTr^domand for a 25,1 increase is being considered by the Coal Controller, who is dealing this week with that application for a national advance of 25fi which has been put forward by the -Miners1 Federation and it is possible that the notices may be withdrawn.The i7ar Office Contracts Department reports that five old cases of dispute are still in progress and that.four&apos;now cases have occurred.   The most significant of these &quot;arises out of the action of the National Warehouse and General Vforkers1 Union in making application for various increases in wages to Messrs. Parke, Davis and Company of Hounslow, Chemical Manufacturers. As a result of this ten members of the employees&apos;, conoittee were dismissed, the firm refused to have any dealings with the Union ana have posted up a notice in their shops that their employees cannot be allowed to continue in the Union,   This is an excellent commentary on the reports of the Industrial Commission-4 ers,Much more important was the trouble which arose among the wool sorters in the Bradford and Ilklcy Districts over the exclusion &quot;of workers x;ho&quot;T.Hf Vn^a^eu&quot; on&apos;trpack&quot;&apos;work&quot; (piece work) from an advance of IQfi in \idges which has recently been granted to all the other members of the Wool SortersT Union.   The employers held a meeting on the 23rd and decided to include the pack men in the ^rant., Most workers in the leather trade ?.re putting forward application for very, considerable increases in wagesj but,it does nbt appear likely that the employers will be prepared to agree to their demands.The agitation over the recent Engineering Award appears likely to come to a head at an early&quot;date&quot;/&quot;&quot; A Special Meeting of the Executive of Shipbuilding and Engineering Federated Trades was held on the 24-th to discuss the matter, and four societies, vis, the L,3.3., the Toolmakers, the Electrical Trades, and the Ironmoulders have passed resolutions that- if the award is not amended, they intend to &quot;down tools&quot; on September 1st.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 117 cases of dispute&quot;,&quot; mostly of a&quot; very minor character, as having been in progress during-the week.   Forty of.these have been successfully settled, chiefly by the exertions of the Departmentfs officers, and only eight resulted in stoppages of work.The Ministry of Munitions report ten cases of dispute, two&apos; of wh i chHba voTb e en&quot; sue eon s ful ly settled.   Both the latter arose, out of allegations of victimisation.   Cases of this kind are becoming increasingly common, in most of them the allegations appear on-investigation to be unfounded.
At Messrs. Richard Thomas and Company Limited,  (Llanelly) an Important dispute arose owing to the action of members of the A.S.E. in refusing to work overtime as a protest against the 3/- award.   The men&apos;s demands (not so far endorsed &quot;by their Union) are for a further advance of 3/l-gd. which would in faot put their wa^es on a level with those paid to engineers in the tinplate and steel trades *   The employers intimated their willingness to consider this proposal, hut owing to the importance of the points involved, the question is engaging the attention of the Ministers of Munitions and Labour.&apos; A serious dispute has arisen out of the proposal of the Ministry of Munitions to give additional payment for AuguBt Bank Holiday to blast furnacemen and coke-oven men.   The Cleveland blast fuma-cemen are now demanding a similar remuneration for the Stockton Race Week;   A.two days1 strike was with difficulty averted, and the whole question Of the. position-of-blast furnacemen as. regards holidays was referred to.a conference to be held on-the S8th&quot;:inst,One other dispute reported by-the Ministry of Munitions calls, for notice.   This arose at Messrs. Dobson and Barlow, Limited,. BoIten, owing to the fact that men released from the a liny have been placed&apos;upon machines for working plates at 14/-per.week less than the standard .rate for che district,,&quot;; The/London Bakers are pressing strongly for the abolition of night-work and a ballet has been taken on the question of a stoppage of work.   The result is not yet ;oiown, but it is estimated that 90$ of the men are in favour of drastic action. The masters do not consider that there is &quot;the slightest possibility of a strike&quot;.   The matter is being dealt with by Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P. of the Ministry cf P*od.-The Committee on Produetion have heard during the past week 16 arbitration cases in London, 2 on the North East Coast and 4 in Scotland.The oases heard on the North East Coast were in regard to the piece rates to be paid for rivetting work on standard Ships.   -
3 9SECTION III;  District Reports,-7ith the exception of some slight trouble at Parkhead over the non-payment of certain 3Ums of money $ v.&apos;hieh have usually been received after the holidays (locally termed &quot;subs&quot;/ conditions in this area are normal.The question of the reinstatement of the deportees does not appear to be quite as near a permanent settlement as it did last week.   Some of them are comdaining that the situations offered by the Ministry of Munitions are in places outside the Glasgow boundary.   They fear that this is a trap, set with the intention of diminishing their influence.Generally, speaking, ho?;ever, the recent action^ of the deportees do not seem to have net with much public approval. This was well shown in their acceptance of the Ministry of Munitions1 Offer of employment, which was largely due to rank and file pressure.   The leading spirits are joining the - Industrial Workers df Great Britain, which appears to be the only extremist organisation, the -membership of which is at the present time increasing.The situation appears to be more satisfactory. Evidence continues to accumulate that the opinion in this area is strongly hostile to participation in the Stockholm conference.   Strong resolutions have been passed by several local branches ox drillers and engineers protesting against the vote of the Labour Conference.The Chopwell miners have passed-&apos; a resolution demanding that war workers shall be taken for the Army before regular miners.An important conference of miners&apos; delegates has been held at which it v/as resolved to instruct&apos;.the executive to make an application for a 50^ increase in the minimum wage rates.   In the event of a refusal on the part of the employers a ballot is to be taken on the question of downing tools.Conditions at Barrow are normal.   The  position as regards the 3hop Stewards is rather peculiar.   They appear to be vaguely determined to take drastic action as soon as a suitable opportunity presents itselff in view of the fact that they have decided against definite agitation on the Subject of the general Engineering award t it is obvious that they distrust their power to bring about concertedaction.Apart from the Boilermakers1 Strike on the Mersey .(referred to in Section I) the situation in: this area during the last week has been normal.The proceedings of the Cotton Control Board are being watched with interest and anrdety, but on the whole the attitude of Labour towarc?s the Board is rather sympathetic than hostile.The Lancashire and Cheshire miners, 70,000 in number, have passed a resolution demanding, that men who have entered the pits since the outbreak of the war should be takon for the Army before the bona fide miners.In Yorkshire, &apos; dth the exception oi continuing unrest in the woollen industry, the position is normal. Generally speaking the trouble among the various woollen workers has not become really acute,  is they are awaiting the results of the Government5s action in appointing a Control Board, The most ur jent problem is that which haw arisen amon;: the/ wool
wool sorters and which is described in greater detail in Section II. &quot; &quot;:.- The proposed district conference of workers1 and Soldiers&apos; Delegates y/hich was to have been held on September 1st., has. been prohibited by. the Home Office and it does not appear that any attempt will be made to hold it. Arrangements, are in fact being made to elect the distriot representatives to the provisional committee by letter ballot..le Midlands. :      The situation is fairly satisfactory.   In Nottinghamthere is a certain amount of ^discontent amon&apos;j the Engineers who have various grievancesy the most important of which is the recent award by the Committee on Production.   Workers in the Building TradeB are also restless owing to the delays which have taken place in connection with an application which was made for higher wages.In Birmingham, which is on the whole opposed to participation in the Stockholm conference, much sympathy is expressed with Mr, Henderson..The National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors which is very active in the Midlands has associated itself strongly with the Governments position in regard to Stockholm.   The Federation is reported to have decided to run two candidates for Birmingham constituencies at the next General Election.The Warwickshire Miners sent delegates to London  -during the week to proclaim their strong protest against the Stockholm conference directly to the Prime Minister,With the exception of isolated s*trikes at various works the situation is quiet.Mr.  7.C. Anderson, M,?., who recently visited Woolwich, and made rather an extreme speech, met with a favourable reception.   The opinion at Woolwich is decidedly favourable to participation in the Stockholm conference which,it is thought, cannot do any harm and may conceivably do much good. Various Trade Councils in the London district such as those of Poplar and Letchworth have passed resolutions to the same effeat.Mr. Churchill&apos;s work at the Ministry of Munitions is being watched closely and suspiciously, but so far the tone of comment is distinctly favourable.The Allied Socialist Conference which is sitting in London this week seems to have aroused but little Interest.In South, Wales there does not at the moment appear to be any acute industrial, unrest, though the position in the local Mining area is such that strikes may and do occur at any time.Opinion in favour of participation in the Stockholm conference has consolidated itself more especially among the&apos; miners, &quot;Mr, Henderson&apos;s attitude has been the subject of warm eommendation, and various rather strongly y/ordedresolutions have be en pas sed, condemningthetreatment whichhe has received.     He is thought to have improved his political position very decidedly.A movement Is reported among the miners to follow the example recently set in Lanarkshire and deolare a one day strike,, throughout the area, as a means of protesting against profiteering,eland. a disproportionate number of; strikes have recently takenplace in Ireland, where the general position is reported to be unsatisfactory.   There is a good c\eal of unemployment In all branches of work except agriculturet discontent among &quot;Urban district -Cornells&apos;&apos;1&quot; employees at the lo*r state of tJjeir wages, and unrest among the Engineers both at Belfast and Dublin;0&quot;ing to the alleged arbitrary Awards of Munition Tribunals.
it pjrjsa opinion.The small majority by which the Labour Party Conference of 21st August passed the resolution in favour of representation of Stockholm, and the subsequent resolution excluding the I.L.P., the B.S.Po and the Fabian Society from participation, have afforded matter for fertile discussion in the Press during the weekoWhile the Pacifist Press insisted on the essential value of a majority however small,, and demands that the deputation be permitted to proceed, the commonplace daily journal is inclined to view the Resolution as negligible, on account of the diminution in the majority which adopted it.On the second point the views of the excluded bodies are best stated in the Merthyr Pioneer and the Labour Leader.   The former paper has a long article by l&apos;..r, Jowett MiP. explaining the relations of the I.L.P. to the. Labour party, and alleging that-the resolution to exclude the smaller socialist bodies from the deputation is the result of a deliberate campaign of systematic mis-representation.   He writesr- &quot;The treatment of Mr, &quot;Henderson by the Government,,.,...was obscured by the &quot;desire on the part of a comparatively small proportion &quot;of the Trades1&apos; Union delegates who, influenced by the &quot;carefully fostered and expensively conducted antl-I.L.P.&quot;agitation^- wanted, ab^ve all things else, to jockey the &quot;I..L.P out of the International and out of the Labour &quot;Party.   Althoughccthe number Of Trades1 Union &quot;delegates who are supporting the plot against the I^Lo?., &quot;is comparatively small., they were sufficient to trrn thfj&apos;scale in their respective sectional meetings., t *oWi bh the &quot;result that the majority of 1.296,000 for Stockholm on &quot;August 10th sank to one of 3000 on August 22nd,t,tThe &quot;effect of the Conference decision will be that even if &quot;the Government should decide to allow pasgocrts; it&apos; will &quot;(this may be taken for granted) refuse/to the I.-.L.Pi &quot;delegates, and will endeavour to shield itself from the &quot;consequences of its refusal by throwing the &quot;responsibility on to the Labour Party.&quot;:Mr. P. Snowden writing in the Labour Leader says &quot;....!i?he Tuesday Conference also refused to allow &quot;minority representation at the International Conference * &quot;This is a decision which the I.L.P. will not accept &quot;for a moment.   The I.L.P. is not at this time Of the &quot;war going- to abandon.its principles, nor will it allow &quot;the majority of the Labour Party to absorb it. &quot;The Labour Party Conference has passed an impossible &quot;resolution, and one they will never carry into effeot.&apos;&apos;Mr. Robert Y/illiams has an article - &quot;The &quot;Stockholm Pires Burning&quot; in the Herald. He says:-&quot;...If I were in a position to advise, I would suggest &quot;that these organisations (fere, the I.L.P., B,S.P*, and &quot;Pabian Society) - should refrain from applying fer &quot;passports In the existing circumstances *   Personally^ &quot;one could have hoped that the I.-.L.P., and B.S..P.;, %ould have made a statement to the effect that if the &quot;labour Party, as a party, would adhere to their &quot;previous decision to send delegates to Stockholm, that &quot;they (the oocialist bodies) would not seek separate &quot;representationvStockholm gerenoe.
It seems htwever improbable that the offended parties will refrain from fighting against the decision of the Conference.In another nart of the same issue the Herald expresses hope that, &quot;even if it is still held that &quot;the Socialist bodies &quot;shall not,be represented, certain means will be found to &quot;select some members of the minority when the Labour Party &quot;elicted its eight delegates.   In any case it is better to have &quot;a conference with only the British majority represented, than &quot;no conference at all&quot;*Several journals comment on the possibility of a serious Split in the labour Movement as a result of the divergence of opinions as to Stockholm.   Their viovv was also expressed in an interview with Mr. i?illiams, secretary of the Transport 7/orkers Federation, reported in the Birmingham Daily Post of August^^.^ 23rd and it is ur^ed strongly&quot; in the British citizen and Empxre;^ &quot;on this question it is obvious that organized Labour is splii !*from top to bottom.   Mr.&apos; Henderson1 s leadership has led the &quot;movement into the pathways of disaster&quot;.r    -   A large number of resolutions hostile to the Conference and &quot;passed, by local branches of Trade Unions, and by &apos;.7orkments meetingBare reported.   This feeling appears to be specially strong in the Northern Counties of England. v.,?-*   &quot; *&quot;:&apos;The Birmingham Daily Popt of 24th August published copies of Telegrams despatched by the National federation of discharged and demobilized sailors and&apos;soldiers to His Majesty the King and to the Prime Minister, protesting against a British delegation to Stockholm.It is pointed out in various quarters that, though the French Government has refused passports for Stockholm^,the Socialists of that country continue to mako their arrangements and that the Confederation  eWrale du Travail has joined them to this end.   The Herald anticipates that &quot;this dooisiou should &quot;bring in the American Federation of Labour, as Gompers gave as &quot;one reason ,for refusing- the fact that the French Trade &quot;Unionists had not decided to attend.&quot;Justice considers it worthy of note that nearly all the old Social-DemocratS in the belligerent countries are hostile to Stockholm, citing specially the cases of Plekhanoff, who has urged-vthe ivronoh Socialists against participation, and of Jules Quosde. the PrenchmAn.The question of the aims, objects and possibilities of SteokhoiSjm. and the advantages or disadvantages of participationare&quot; still; discussed/at considerable length, notably in the Herald &quot;(the.

Tne -last named has/Vdry well balanced essay in favour of partioipation, analyzing: the ar?:umente&apos; for and against this policy &amp;t considerable length.   In the course of the article the aims of the mass of the British delegates are stated to be - &quot;first, &quot;to lay upon Germany, and to the degree of their power, upon &quot;the German majority socialists, the, responsibility for this &quot;war, and, second, to dispose the German delegates to the &quot;democratization ofth*ir Government/ as the sole conditions &quot;of a durable peace.  In this sense, we-regard th* delegation &quot;aB a moral and democratic mission/whose object/is the &quot;correction of the errors of the German Socialists, and their &quot;amendment in the future&quot;.

The $our-nal points -out ,the dangers incidental to this course of action^   Another resolution proposed to set up an unofficial Press1 Censorship-, (Doubtless oh the model of that now exercised by the Russian compositoi^s).

T GEHEBAI- REMARKS.vral Though the temporary settlement of the trouble among thetTonT&quot;   Boilermakers has eliminated.the most serious industrialdispute, the labour position and outlook cannot be deemed satisfactory.   In a recent report attention was drawn to the tendency to protest by means of a strike against decisions or awards of the Committee on Production, or of arbitrators. This tendency is still obvious,   A still more disquieting feature is the ever-growing and apparently illimitable demand for large increases in wages, - in many cases emphasized by stoppages of work or accompanied by notices ox strike,,should the demand not prove successful^During the past week demanfca df this nature have been made frequently, and in many quarters.   The most important are those urged upon its executive by the local branches of the national Union of Railwaymen, and those made by the Minersr Federation, their importance lyih? in the essential nature of the industries affected, and the lar^e number of workmen concerned. .In the former case it is rq^orted that a general demand has been made by tho branches, lor an additional all-round increase of  1 per week fo. all employees, coupled with a reduction of the hours of labour.   Jn the latter the Federation is in treaty with the Coal Controller for an -increase of 25fo on all wages.   It Is estimated that con-cession of their demand would   amount to&apos;aii&apos;iiicre&amp;se of  500,000 per week in the mining Wage bill.   It is instructive to notice that t2ie Miners of the Black Country in making their claim base it on the cost of living and the high Wages paid to munition workers.The epidemic has however by no means confined itself to these two industries.   The South  /ales Steel  /orkers demand an additional 20)] on vavos already extraordinarily high. First hands ar: nor: 3*id from 212 to  16 per week, second hands from -26 to 28, and helpers S5vThe Transport &quot;orkers1 Federation demands&apos;.an additional 20/- per week Oh pre-war rates for 150,000 vehicle workers. The Flax rougher3 and mill . orkers claim an increase of 10/-for men, 5/- for women and youn^ peo;ple, and that the previous war bonus be classed as enhanced wa^res.The Clyde District Committee of the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades&apos; Federation put in a claim for an increase equivalent to the Increase in the cost of living, i.e, 100% on pre-war rates-,&apos;, less 27^*&amp; advance already granted.Of disputes causing a stoppage of vork the &quot;;reat majority are due.to demand for an increase of waves supported by immediate &quot;down tools&quot; action.   Of 38 case;; of stoppage contained in tho Labour Statistics report for the week, no less&apos;than ;.-7&apos;are of this kind,The reasons for this most unsatisfactory state of affairs are not far to seek.   The rise in the cost of living affords its excuse, tho practical impossibility of resisting tho demand its explanation.   Doubtless the reason viven by t3ie Black Country miners has he/&quot; some eiiect.   The&quot;evil is a growing one and past success encourages to   teater future effort.   Under existing circumstances no heroic remedy is possible, but the recognition of the evil is an argument in favour of a firm policy on the part of the Government, in order to dispel any idea that threat of a strike is sufficient argument in su,- ort oi claims otherwise unsup;ortable.D.J.S.&amp; II?
