The situation with regard to the claims of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers &amp; Firemen has again &quot;become awkward, and I should like to bring the present position to the notice of the War Cabinet.During the recent negotiations which led to the immediatedemand for the institution of an 8 hours1 day being dropped, Istated to the Society that I would use my good offices withthe Bailway Executive Committee to secure that they wouldreceive the menrs representatives and discuss other outstandingmatters.   The Bailway Executive Committee met representativesof the Associated Society on Friday last, and it was thenarranged that the Society should formulate an application.They have now forwarded for the consideration of the Committeethe following: -&quot;That 3.6d. per day be added4to the 2s.6d. per day war wages now paid to the locomotive drivers, firemen, cleaners, and electric motormen.Half that amount to engine cleaners under 18 years of age&quot;They also request that the following matters be discussed when a meeting takes place between them and the Railway Executive Committee:&quot;(1) That the lodging allowances paid to locomotivemen be increased.(2) That provision be made for a supply of food to locomotivemen booked off  unexpectedly away from home during the time the shops are closed, or the alternative that lodging away from home be abolished altogether.(3) The recognition that all Railways extend to locomotive-men the full benefit to be derived from the application of Clause 72 of the Boyal Commissions Beport&quot;There is nothing of importance in these last three points,but the claim for an addition of 3s.6d. a day to be added tothe 2s.6d* per day war wages would mean an over-all increaseover the pre-war wage of about 42s. or 43s. per week. Thenominal
nominal increase is 36/-, and this increase affects the payments for overtime and Sunday duty, so that the total increase would not be.less than the amounts mentioned above.The real difficulty in the position is that it is impossible to concede the Associated Society more than the National Union of Railwaymen have already agreed t accept, viz:   that the present War Bonus of 15/- per week should be converted into War Wages, and thus come into account when calculating the amount due for over-time and Sunday duty, making, in effoct, an increase over pre-war wages of about 18/- per week.    Anything more given to the Society would produce an instant conflict with the National Union, who have behaved very well up to the present, whilst the Society has not.The Railway Executive Committee are meeting re-presentatives of the Associated Society on Friday next and it is not proposed to offer the Society more than hat been accepted by the National Union.    The differ-ence between what will be offered and what has been asked for is so great that there is a possibility of renewed threats of a strike, and I shall be glad to know that the War Cabinet approve of the course which it is proposed to adopt..
