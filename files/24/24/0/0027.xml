.BINFMEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OF LABOUR.i^^roposal to transfer Employment Exchanges to NationalService Department.I understand that a proposal lias been put forward for the transfer of the administration of the Employment Exchanges to the National Service Department.I consider this proposal to be open to a number of grave objections which may be summarised as follows: 1. If the recruiting of civilian labour is placed in the hands of the Department which controls the administration of compulsory military service, a suspicion that this is merely a veiled form of industrial conscription will be aroused in the minds of organised labour, which cannot but be gravely detrimental to the national interests. Whatever efforts may be made to keep the two parts of the Department distinct, the central authority which has the determining voice on the civilian side must also appear as the authority for enforcing compulsion on the military side; the staffs and local offices on the two sides, though distinct, will be well known to be but two branches of the same concern, and no amount of argument, will persuade the public that the element of compulsion, which is necessarily present on the military side, has not infected the civilian side also. If the proposal were carried out-and I sincerely trust that it will not there would very soon be such a volume of opposition that it would have to &quot;be reversed; and in the meantime a serious loss,.which the country cannot afford, would have been suffered in the work which is now being done, even under.the present unsatisfactory conditions, in the supply of labour for essential needs. .;     \,;Y;-V.../.;,..2. The administration of the Employment Exchanges closely concerns the interests of labour at every point, and it forms, in volume, and in some respects in importance also, much the greater part of the work of the Ministry of Labour, which was established as recently as January last. Its transfer to another Department would reduce the Ministry of Labour to a mutilated fragment, with no very obvious reason for further existence, and it would further be necessarily regarded as a definite indication that the problems of demobilisation, for dealing with which the Exchanges are an essential piece of machinery and in which labour is vitally interested, are not after all&apos; to be any concern of the Ministry of Labour. lean fairly claim to be influenced by no feeling of personal ambition when I say that it would be a matter which I should deeply deplore if my advent to office were marked by such a surrender of the legitimate rights of labour.I should view with serious alarm the effect which so large a diminution of the the powers and functions of the Ministry of Labour would be likely to have on the Labour Movement at the present juncture. It would be regarded as evidence that the Ministry of Labour, which was established so recently and after a demand for its establishment had been urged for very many years, is not intended to be a reality, but is a mere piece of make-believe. In this connection I may call attention to the resolution, printed below, which is to be moved by the Parliamentary Committee, the executive authority of the whole Trade Union movement, at the forthcoming Trades Union Congress. If, in the face of this resolution, the proposed transfer takes place, it will inevitably be regarded as a slight on the Trade Union Movement, and will considerably strengthen the hands of the element in the Labour Party who are now working for a break with the Government.J ./ 3. The separate functions of the National Service Department as regards the supply of labour has, in the past, been defended, and their transfer to the Ministry.of Labour has been resisted, mainly on the ground of the alleged unpopularity of the Exchanges with organised labour. Now, I do not think I am doing an injustice to anyone when I assert that the Ministry of Labour commands the general confidenceu   (33)3789   Pk 47   52   S,&apos;17   E &amp; S
of organised labour to at least as great a degree as any other Department, and if the Exchanges are unpopular now they could not be less unpopular were their administration transferred elsewhere. I am, therefore, at a loss to understand why the National Service Department are desirous of having the Exchanges transferred to their charge.I should add that I do not admit that these charges of unpopularity are in general well founded or that the reorganisations&apos; initiated by Mr. Hodge, and in particular&apos; the establishment of Local Advisory Committees, will not remove any outstanding grounds of suspicion. On this point I need only refer to Mr. Hodge&apos;s memorandum of 13th August, with- which I fully concur, and I may justly claim, also, that the present desire of the National Service Department to take over the Exchanges is an indication that the charges are not entirely sincere.4. There is a single system of Employment Exchanges, under unified control, for the whole of the United Kingdom. On the other hand, there has been, in the past, a separate and independent Director-General of National Service for Ireland, and presumably this arrangement is to continue, particularly as compulsory military service applies only to Great Britain. If this is so, the transfer of the Exchanges to the National Service Department would involve the division of the Exchange system into two parts. This may possibly require legislation as regards the Labour Exchanges Act of 1909, and would certainly require legislation as regards the administration of unemployment insurance under the National Insurance Acts which, as will be explained in the next paragraph, cannot be divorced from the Exchanges. The practical effects of a separate administration for Ireland, serious enough in the case of unemployment insurance, would be gravely injurious as regards the supply of labour. The use of Irish labour in Great Britain is far from being free from cliificul-ties, but it is nevertheless, and will continue to be, essential. The loss of man-power that would probably result from placing the supply of labour for Ireland under separate control is so serious that it is, in itself, sufficient in my opinion to condemn the present proposal.5. In addition to the supply of adult labour the Exchanges carry, out a number of other functions to which there is no counterpart in the National Service Depart-ment, but which cannot be divorced from the Exchanges. If the Exchanges are transferred, their functions must be transferred also, and I very much doubt whether, when the proposal was put forward, the full consequences were realised.It will be sufficient to mention two of the principal functions of this nature.In the first place, the Exchanges make special provision for dealing with &quot; juveniles,&quot; i.e., boys and girls under the age of 17. This provision includes, among other things, the closest co-operation with the Local Education Authorities in a large number of centres. This work would have to go over with the Exchanges, and as the National Service Department has not hitherto dealt with persons under 18, a great extension of its previous scope would be entailed, and that in a sphere which, involving peculiarly delicate and difficult problems, has not hitherto been regarded as part of national service work.In the second place, the Exchanges administer an extensive system of insurance against unemployment, covering 3o- million workpeople. As it is an essential part &apos;of any system of unemployment insurance that the office paying benefit must be in a position to offer employment, unemployment insurance must go along with the Exchanges. This, again, would be a very large addition to the functions of the National Service Department: (The difficulties in this respect arising from the need for legislation, if Ireland is to. be separately administered, have been pointed out in the previous paragraph.)6. The last objection which I wish to mention arises out of the arrangements which have recently been made for the transfer from the National Service Department to the Employment Exchanges of the work of obtaining women for the Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps. I will not enter into the reasons for this transfer, but will merely say that the transfer lias been publicly announced, and has attracted con-siderable attention; the Women&apos;s Department of the National Service Department has, I believe, ceased its work, and in the next few days women will be asked to enrol at the Employment Exchanges instead of at the National Service Department. I venture to suggest that it would be too great a trial to the - mystified and exasperated public if these proceedings are now reversed by the transfer of the Exchanges to the National Service Department.
I submit that these objections are conclusive against the present proposal. It seems to me that the task of obtaining recruits for the Army is one which ought to be undertaken without other preoccupation, and which is sufficiently arduous and difficult to engage the undivided attention of the National Service Department. The course that should be taken in order to put an end to the present deplorable overlapping and confusion between the National Service Department and the Ministry of Labour is, in my opinion, that. suggested in Mr. Hodge&apos;s Memorandum of 13th August, which I entirely endorse, viz., to transfer to the Employment Exchanges the present functions of the National Service Department as regards the supply of labour.I should add that Mr. Hodge concurs in the views expressed in the present memorandum.G. H. 11.20th August 1917.RESOLUTION TO BE MOVED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY   COMMITTEE AT THE FORTHCOMING TRADES UNION CONGRESS.Ministry of Labouk.:&apos; This Cougress expresses its hearty approval of the creation of a Ministry of Labour.      ,.It welcomes the appointment of Advisory Committees to assist in the work of Employment Exchanges, provided they are collectively nominated by the bodies to be represented; and the duties assigned to these Committees should be extended so as to give them a real opportunity for rendering service to the Department.It also approves the proposed extension of the Trade Boards Acts to several other trades, on lines of the resolution passed at the Birmingham Congress.The Ministry of Labour will not fill its proper place in the Government of&apos; the State until its powers and duties are considerably enlarged, including the transfer to the Ministry of the duties relating . to the inspection of factories, workshops, and transport (including railways and waterways).Owing to the confusion arising through each Government Department having-control of their staff&apos; and employes and the overlapping of jurisdiction on general Labour questions exercised by the War Council, Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, and the Home Office, the Labour Ministry should be reformed by the unification of all Labour negotiations on bshalf of the Government under the Labour Ministry;. And we instruct the Parliamentary Committee to bring before the notice of the Prime Ministef the views of this Congress on this question, which is of first importance to&apos;the well-being of those engaged in the industrial occupations of the country.- , ..
