USE OF EXPLOSIVE All:olTlTIOILAGAIdT AEROPLAKES.(Copy of a letter from Secretary,Air Board to Secretary,War Cabinet...) &apos;        -Sir,I am directed by the President of the Air Board to refer to the memorandum of July 7th 1916, ( aper iTo.G.T.157) on the use of explosive bullets against Zeppelins, addressed by Lord Curzon as President of the Air Board to the War Committee.I am to state that tho attention :of the Board has been drawn to the&quot;fact that, owing to the large dimensions of the Gotha aeroplanes employed in Air Raids on this country and their relatively small vulnerable area, much ordinary ammunition is expended upon them without results.      It -has been suggested that by adopting the use Of explosive ammunition, Brock or Pomeroy, against these aeroplanes, the chances of bringing them dbwn would be greatly increased.. The Eoard have had the matter under consideration and I am desired to submit to the War Cabinet their recommendation that the use of explosive bullets, which has hitherto been restricted by the decision of the War Committee to action against Zeppelins within this country, be extended to action against Aeroplanes or sea-planes engaged in raids upon this country. The prohibition of export of such ammunition outside this country would be maintained.I am to observe that the arguments adduced in the memorandum above quoted in support of the use of explosive ammunition against Zeppelins appear, in a.large measure to apply equally ic* their use against heavier, than air machines, engaged in bombing open towns and non-combatants,&apos; while it is equally probable that.the enemy would remain In ignorance of our use cf bullets of; this type,.. I -am to request that the matter, may be submitted to the War Cabinet-, and that the Air Board, may be informed of the decision arrived at.I am,Sir,- \ *Your, obedient Servant.,(Signed) H. P. KARW.28th August,1917.WAR CABIITET.G.1.1877.
