12 305S E C R E T,OPERATIONS.August 28th, 1917.Handed in 7.50 p.m.352. Your 40254. The following figures have been given me by Cadorna.1. Up to yesterday evening 2nd Army has fired 669,000 rounds2-. 2nd Army on&apos;same date still had in hand 700,000 rounds and 3rd Army 287,000, making allowance for the loss due to explosion of magazine yesterday at Udine.3. He has a reserve, in his own hands for the present, of 233,000 rounds which is the result of accumulation of between 21,000 and 22,000 rounds daily since August 17th.4e He intends to keep a reserve in hand after the battle of ijt -million rounds, which has already been set aside for the-purpose and will not be touched.5. It is difficult as yet to state separately how many rounds were expended in the opening bombardment and how many in subsequent operations, as the offensive had been a succession of actions involving bombardment and in support of troops.   On August 15th,16th,17th and 18th&quot;2nd Army used 185,000 rtunds and 3rd /Army 100,000.     August 18th was the only day of real bombardment *Figures given above refer to medium and heavy artillery ammunition only.     For field artillery there are available in the country 7,000 rounds per gun for every gun in the Army. To field batteries of the 3rd and 2nd Armies 3,000 rounds per gun have been allotted, and of this only a small proportion has been expended.   I will send later a detailed state of field artillery ammunition.and 3rd Army 363,000.-1
