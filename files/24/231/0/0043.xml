IRISH.SITUATION.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.          I circulate herewith the draft of a despatch to Mr. De Valera in reply to his despatch of 2nd July,          This draft has had preliminary considerationby the Irish Situation Committee.        -  The question was raised at the meeting of theCommittee whether it would be advisable to refer in the reply to Mr. De Valera to the fact that in the United Kingdomdeclaration accepting the &quot;Optional Clause&quot; dated 19thSeptember, 1929 we specifically excepted (inter alia)     &quot;Disputes with the Government of any other      member of the League which Is a member of      the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;adding that all such disputes       &quot;shall be settled In such manner as the        Parties have agreed or shall agree&quot;                  &apos;(see Cmd. 3421)        On the whole it seems best not to do so sincethe Irish Free State declaration accepting the &quot;Optional Clause&quot;(dated 14th September 1929) contained no such exceptionand was made        &quot;on the sole condition of reciprocity.&quot;          This declaration was made under the auspices ofthe Cosgrave Government.E C R E T .P. 242 (52)
9 73w 3 J         It was largely because of the United Kingdomreservation quoted above that it was thought necessary to bring before the Imperial Conference of 1930 the question ofthe constitution of a special tribunal to deal withinter-Governmental disputes between Members of the BritishCommonwealth,(Signed)J.H. T.inions Office,5th July, 1932.
                                     Downing Street,                                                  July, 1932. iEE STATEDr for External Affairs.                       Sir,                                I have the honour to acknowledge                       the receipt of your despatch No.95 of the                       2nd July in reply to my despatch No.137 of                       the 22nd June regarding the question of                       arbitration in relation to the Land Annuities.                          2,    As I made clear in the Debate in                       the House of Commons on Monday, the 4th                       July, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United                       Kingdom are most sincerely anxious to arrive                       at an amicable settlement of this matter.                          3V,     The form of tribunal which His                       Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom                       have  proposed was  that  recommended at the                       Imperial  Conference  of  1930 and,  for  that                       reason,  this  form  of  tribunal  still seems
                                         CJ  P*                                           * to  them to &quot;be the most appropriate.Nevertheless, they are ready, in orderto arrive at an amicable settlement, toconsider any variation in the form oftribunal which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Irish Free State may wish tosuggest, so long as its members are drawn from within the British Commonwealth.     4.   The  difference between  the  two Governments  on the  question  of  arbitration in relation  to the  Land Annuities is, therefore, narrowed down  to  this singlepoint, which, as between two Members of theBritish Commonwealth, cannot possibly, in  theview of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedJ:- &quot;artificial&quot; was the word used by Mr. de Valera in his despatch of Snd July.Kingdom, be regarded as involving an artificialor unreasonable restriction.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would makethe most earnest appeal to the Irish FreeState Government not to allow the  /
possibility of a friendly settlement ofthe Land Annuities question to breakdown on this one point.     5,   As regards paragraph 4 ofyour despatch, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom do not feel thatfor their part it would be necessaryfor them to obtain parliamentary ratifi-cation of an agreement for the reference of the matter in question to arbitrationbut if His Majesty&apos;s Government in theIrish Free State would prefer that any agreement on the subject should be made subject to parliamentary ratification on both sideSj they would not wish to offerany objection.     6,   In regard to the other payments referred to in paragraph 3 ofyour despatch No. 95 of the 2nd July,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United- ill -
Kingdom have not been informed of theground on which the liability of the IrishFree State is disputed-   If, however,they can be given an indication of thequestions arising in relation to these payments which it is suggested   are suitable for reference to arbitration,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom will be glad to consider thepossibility of agreeing to the arbitration of those questions on thesame basis, and by the same tribunal, asthey have already proposed in the caseof the land annuities.
