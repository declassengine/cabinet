G ENEVA C ONV ERS AT ION S.Note by the Home Secretary of a Conversation atGeneva on June 29th, 1932, between the UnitedKingdom and French Delegations.The Home Secretary would like the Cabinet to see thisrecord, which makes quite clear that since his returnany conceivable misapprehension about the question of budgetary limitation has been removed.Geneva Conversations.           The conversations between the British, Frenchand American Delegations, adjourned last Thursday, were tohave been resumed to-day (Yifedne sday, June 29th).   M. Paul-Boncour had returned from Paris for the purpose and he was accompanied by M. Leygues.   M. Jouvenel and M. Masslgliwere also here.   The Americans were apparently not very anxious to continue these discussions at the present stage,and, after some conversation between Sir John Simon andFir. Gibson, their delegates did not in fact appear.The French took no umbrage at this, and accepted my Sugges-                            togethertion that we should go over/ the ground covered last weekand dispose of the points outstanding, without endeavouringto break new ground.           Several points had been left for examination byexperts, who were to be accompanied by political members &apos;o&amp;the delegations, and it was agreed that this examination should be begun forthwith.   The points were-           Definition of &quot;the battlefield&quot;, outside which       bombing should not be allowed (v/ith certain exceptions).
             Maximum sise  of military  aeroplanes           (subject  to certain  exceptions).             Possible limitation of  numbers,  and  total           tonnage,  of planes under the maximum  size.             Maximum size  and  number of  dirigibles.             Calibre  of  normal army  artillery below which           number  of units  was  not to be  limited.             The  French  took occasion  to repeat that all the proposals  as  to bombing and the  maximum size  of aeroplanes were dependent,  so  far as they vrere  concerned, upon the  internationallsation  of the large  civil  planes. As this matter,however,  was now under  discussion  by a Sub-Committee of  the Air  Commission  of the  Conference, we agroed not  to  discuss it here.           In connection  with the maximum size of  new fortress  guns  the French suggested that  It might  be limited to the maximum  size to  be fixed for new  naval guns.   With the  possibility of  Singapore in mind, I pointed out that  a  fort  armed  with the smaller  new  gunsmight have to  defend  itself against  an existing battle- ship armed with present  larger guns.   This was recog- nised.    Possible alternatives were  (a)  that so soon as guns of a  given calibre  (e.g.  16&quot;) had disappeared from the  seas., ,g\ms of  that  calibre  in land  fortifications should disappear alsoj   (b) that any limitation shouldnot apply  to colonial possessions.   The first alternative would amount to little, and the  second is probably not practicable.   The matter was left without a conclusionbeing reached.
       With regard to the powers of the Permanent  disarmament commission to secure the enforcement of the terms  of theConvention, the difficult question had been raised previouslyof the right of local inspection, and the French had beenasked to specify what they would suggest.   They now submitted a draft of an additional paragraph to be inserted in Article52 of the Draft Convention, the effect of which is the follow-ing:  if a complaint is made to the Commission by  one party that another party is violating the provisions of the Conven-tion, and the Commission on examination of the matter decidesby a two-thirds majority (excluding the parties directly concerned) that it is necessary to make an enquiry sur place,then the High Contracting Parties undertake to facilitatesuch enquiries.   This was reserved for consideration afterthe views of the Americans had been ascertained.       With regard to Budgetary Limitation, I would quote thefollowing extract from the notes of the conversation made byMr. Cadogan:-       &quot;SIR HERBERT SAMUEL then mentioned the question of     Budgetary Limitation and observed that on this point it     would be necessary to await the views of the American     Delegation.   He must also consult the Dominions.   He     further recalled that it had been clearly stated on     the document considered last week that the matter had     not yet been submitted to any of the three Governments     and that the conclusions in that document were therefore     of a tentative nature.   He explained some of the     difficulties about taking the present figure as the     basis of reduction and instanced the fact that the     special cuts which had been imposed on the current budget                         3.
     in the United Kingdom involved such things  as  suspending     the training of the territorial force,  etc.    These  cuts     were obviously of an emergency and purely temporary     nature and could not be repeated,  and it  would therefore     be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to  accept     the present figure as a datum line.&quot;This matter also was not further pursued.         The conversations were then adjourned sine die.We do not propose to discuss the question of land effectives,which in the form stated by president Hoover,  affectsprimarily the countries with conscription and not the BritishEmpire or the United States.   Nor can  we discuss navalreductions, since that would involve negotiating a  revisionof the Washington and London Treaties,  which could  not  even be approached in conversations such as  these.         We shall now take steps to get into closercommunication with the Italian Delegation, and subsequentlywith others, on the matters on which it has been found  thata measure of agreement exists between the British,  Frenchand American points of view.                                H.S.                           29th June, 1932.                 )
