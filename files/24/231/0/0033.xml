Copies of telegrams from the Chief Commissioner at aden bearing on the Jewish - Moslem riots which took piece thereat the end of May were circulated for the information of mycolleagues as CP.178(32) on 30th May 1&apos;932.  I have now-received a full report from the Chief Commissioner on this incident and its causes which,, in- view of the interest which theriots have attracted, I think my colleagues may care to see,and which I circulate herewith.         It will be seen that the Resident considers the originalincident (the defilement of a mosque by filth thrown from a Jewishhouse) was probably the result of carelessness rather thandesign and that the second incident (the placing of a beerbottle in a mosque) was probably the work of some  ill-disposedMuhammadan.  These vie&quot;:s are apparently now accepted by Arabsof standing in Aden.         The Resident&apos;s further recommendation that in the lightof this  incident the Aden Police should be increased from 200 to250 will be considered with the Departments interested as soonas I receive the Government of India&apos;s recommendations on it.It will be seen that Colonel Re illy speaks in the  highest termsof the services rendered both by the police and by theRoyal Air Force Officer commanding the British Forces.                                 8 H.28th June 1932.

SECRET.               No. C/309                                         THE RESIDENCY,                                  Aden,  4th June,  1932.From      Lieutenant-Colonel B.R.Rsilly,  C.T.E.,  O.S.E.,               Chief Commissioner, Aden.To      The Secretary to the Government of India,         Foreign and Political Department,  Simla.        Subject:- Moslem-Jewish disturbances in Aden.Sir,      I have the honour to submit with my comments areport from the Commandant of Police on the recent Moslem-Jewish disturbances in Aden,   It became necessary to  ask forassistance from the Officer Commanding British Forces  in aden, and I enclose a copy of a letter which he has addressedto me on the subject.   As he remarks, the  trouble wascomparatively mild.   There was at no time  any indication of anti-Government or anti-European feeling.   The Jews were however much alarmed, and some of them began to send verymuch exaggerated messages to London,  New York and other  places.I therefore placed a censorship on outward, telegrams underSection 5 (i) (b) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,  fromthe 25th May until the 30th May 1932.   The rioting illustrated the principal risk to law and order in Aden, namely communalconflicts, and it has led me to reconsider the question  of  thestrength of the Armed Police.2.     There has always been a latent antagonism between    IArabs and Jews in Aden, but it has not in the past foundexpression in anything more serious than occasional stone-throwing, mainly by boys, or demonstrations on occasionssuch as football matches.   Outward relations between thetwo races have generally been good- in comparison withPalestine remarkably so.   In recent years there has however been some deterioration due partly to the interest taken by                                                           both/
both races in events in Palestine,  and partly to  the progreslsof the Jews educationally and socially and  the developmentamong them of a national consciousness which has  liftedthem from their former traditional position of inferiorityto the Arabs to one of equality or even to  a suspectedclaim to superiority.3.    The indigenous Jewish population in Aden amountsto about 4000.   In addition large number of Jewish emigrantsfrom the Yemen to Palestine pass through Aden, where  theyare often detained for considerable periods of time awaitingpermission from the Palestinian authorities to proceed ontheir journey.   The presence of this outside elementincreases the work of the police when religious and racialfeelings are inflamed.   In such cases the  sympathies of localIndian Moslems and of the Somalis (some of whom are alwaysinclined to be unruly) are with the Arabs,  while  IndianHindus remain indifferent.4.    These are permanent factors which make a Moslem-Jewish conflict a constant possibility in Aden, althoughclashes have hitherto fortunately been rare.   The betterclass and well-to-do Arabs and Jews are genuinely anxiousto avoid mutual friction and the two communities aregenerally law-abiding and easy to control.    The Arabs are however easily excited by any affront to their religion,and more especially to their mosques, and it was analleged insult by Jews to a mosque that precipitated the     ;recent trouble.5.    The sequence of events is recorded in Mr. Haslam&apos;sreport.   Prom personal  investigation I feel  convinced thatthe filth referred to in paragraph 2 of the report cannot have been thrown  into the mosque courtyard from anywhere,but an  adjacent Jewish house.   I think however that  it                                                       was/
was not thrown intentionally into the mosque.    It isprobable that it was intended to be dropped into a narrowsweeper passage which separates the Jewish houses from tnemosque, and that it fell into the latter through carelessness(which in the circumstances was culpable),  and not by design.Now that the excitement has died down many of the principalArabs themselves accept this view,  although they would not do so in the first indignation that the incident caused.The placing of a beer bottle in another mosque referred toin paragraph 5 of Mr. Haslam&apos;s report was almost certainly not the work of Jews (who by this ti me were far tooterrified to commit such an outrage), but of some maliciousperson - probably a Mohamedan,  This view is also now accepted by sensible Arabs.6.     The disturbances might have become much more seriousif steps had not been taken promptly to suppress them, andthe fact that they were suddenly provoked by a small andprobably accidental incident shows that there  is plenty ofinflammable material in Aden which needs to be controlled by an adequate armed force.   The only armed force availablewithout calling upon military aid is the newly formedarmed police.   At the time of the disturbance its strengthwas 168 men.   Of these 60 (including 30 Indians) were on duty on the Islands of Perim and Kamaran and 7 were sickor on leave, which left 101 men in Aden.   It was unfortunate that 32 new Indian recruits had not yet arrived.   As it       iwas, the force in Aden was almost entirely Arab.7.    Some doubt has always existed as to thereliability of Arab armed police when dealing with adisturbance, and especially a religious disturbance, inwhich one side consisted of people of the same religionand race as themselves.   The trouble last week provided a test, and it is very satisfactory that the conduct ofthe Arab policemen - of both the armed and unarmed branches -was excellent.                                        Credit/
  k, xCredit for this is greatly due to the British Officers,Mr. Haslam (Commandant of Police) and Captain Ropner(Assistant Commandant of Police)  in charge of them, both ofwhom worked indefatigahly throughout the disturbances,   ^and also to the Senior Inspector of the Armed Police(an Indian) and the Police Inspector .n charge of theCrater Division (also an Indian).8.   Under this good control and leadership the Arabshave proved themselves to be efficient and reliable.  Thepolice did not fail in quality, but it is evident thatthey were deficient in quantity.  Military assistance hadto be invoked not because the situation was beyond policecontrol, but because the police were exhausted on thethird day of continuous duty, and no other police wereavailable to relieve them.  The position would have beeneased if the force had been up to its full strength of200, but even with that number adequate reliefs could nothave been arranged had the disturbances been prolongedor had they become more widespread.9.   The normal distribution of 200 men is as follows:-              Aden         -         110              Perim        -          30              Kamaran      -          30       Leave, sick and training       30.                                     200                    *In the light of recent experience I have come to theconclusion that the force  in Aden is too small.  In Mr.GerrardTs original scheme  the total strength of the armedpolice was to be 250.  This was  subsequently reduced to200 mainly because the detachments at Perim and Kamaranwere diminished from  50  to 30 men each.  This effecteda saving  of 40 men, but  it must  be recollected that                                            circumstances/
 circumstances might necessitate a reinforcement of these detachments and that the men on these islands are too far away to he called in to help in an emergency at Aden, where, - owing to its isolated position - any situation that arises must, he met without the possibility of calling.for outside aid.  The only help that can he obtained is from the local military forces.  It is obviously wrong that this should be required purely to supplement the police in dealing with a disturbance such as the one under report. In a more serious difficulty involving internal security the proper role of the military forces is to remain concentrated in order to deal effectively with any situation that may arise and to protect the Settlement against outside attack, as a breakdown of authority in jlden would immediately attract Bedouin looters to the outlying villages of Shaikh Othman,  Eiswa and Imad andpossibly Khormaksar.10.  My conclusion therefore is that the armed police ought to be strengthened, and in this I am in agreementwith the views expressed by Group-Captain Boyd.  If the force is raised to 250 men its normal strength will be about 80 more than it actually was when it was faced bylast week&apos;s outbreak.  This should provide an adequatemargin and should be sufficient to deal with any probable emergency.11.  I am aware of the strong financial objections that my recommendation will encounter, as it will involve an additional annual charge of Hs. 24,700 with an additional Es. 12,000 in the first year for non-recurring expenditure as shown in the attached statement.  But I consider that it would be wrong to ignore the lesson that last week&apos;s rioting has given which has in my opinion shown clearly that an increase in the strength of the armed police force                                                     is/
                                                        ht kl Ois necessary.12.  The Officer Commanding British Forces is putting forward proposals to the Air Ministry for an increase inthe number of armoured cars maintained and for thetraining of the Heavy Battery of Royal Artillery inmusketry, in order to increase their potential value asa reserve for use in grave emergency.13.  In conclusion I wish to record my obligation toGroup-Captain O.T. Boyd, O.B.E., A.F.C., M.C.^ OfficerCommanding British Forces in Aden, and to those under his command who assisted the police, for their co-operation and help in dealing with a situation which, although neverserious, had serious possibilities.

Aden/21/2/Air.                   31st May 1932.          Civil Disturbances:  Crater:  24-26th May 1952.    Sir,              I have the honour to refer to the recent civil    disturbances which occurred in the Crater between 24th and 26th    May 1932 and to forward herewith for your information reports    on the action taken, and movements carried out,  by the Aden    Protectorate Levies and the Armoured Car Section.  These reports    are attached as Appendices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;E&quot; respectively.         2.   The disturbances took; place at a time when    approximately 25 per cent of the Aden Protectorate Levies were    on annual leave, and consequently the number of Arab ranks    available did not exceed 150.  At your request a detachment    consisting of trie 3 British Officers and 50 Arab ranks were    ordered to proceed to Crater to assist the Armed Police.  Three    N.C.0s. and 18 privates were also detailed to take over Armed    Police guards at the Residency, Treasury and Jail.  In addition    to these detachments the Levies continued to provide the normal    quarter guards at No. 8 (B) Squadron and at their own lines    and,  as a result, only about 45 men remained at Khormaksar-to    act as reinforcements or to deal with any additional disturbance    which might have arisen.  I understand that, at one period,    there were indefinite rumours of a disturbance in Sheik Othman  )&apos;    and a threat that the Subeihis would&apos; take advantage of the    situation to carry out a raid.         3.   Beither of these eventualities materialised but, had    they done so, the situation would have been very serious owing    to the small reserves available and the absence of all British    Officers in Crater.Resident  and Commander-in- Chief,      Aden.
     4.   I understand that the Aden Protectorate Levies  were called out, not because the situation had got  beyond Policecontrol but because the numbers of the Police  were insufficient to control the rioters and the Levy reinforcements were requiredfor Police duties rather than as soldiers.   It appears,therefore, that the strength of the Armed Police was inadequate to deal with a comparatively mild disturbance  with the resultthat the military reserves had to be dangerously depleted tomake up the numbers.     5.-   I am aware that the disturbances arose at a most fortunate moment when the Armed Police happened to be 35 understrength, but I would suggest, nevertheless,  that one of  the lessons of these riots is that the total strength of the  ArmedPolice is definitely inadequate to deal with a disturbance ofa serious nature, and would recommend that their establishmentshould be reconsidered with a view to a considerable increase.It would appear reasonable that this increase  should be basedon the number of Aden protectorate Levies who  were called uponto support the Armed Police on this occasion,  i.e. 71 Arab ranks.                      I have, etc.                            (3d.)  0. T. Boyd.                                           Cr oup C apt a in ,                         Commanding, British Forces, Aden.

Subject:-  Moslem &amp;  Jewish disturbances.  Sir,           I have the  honour to  submit my  report on the  recent Arab-  Jew disturbances.       2.   At  about  4  p.m.  on Monday  May 23rd it was  reported at  the  Crater Police Station that a paper bag  containing human excreta  had  been  thrown into the  open  court  yard of the mosque Ebn  Alwan in  the  Zaffran  road.   There are  two  Jewish houses overlooking this mosque  and the  presumption was  that the filth  had been thrown  in by one of  the occupants of one  of  these houses.   The Police Inspector visited  the mosque  and made enquiries with one  of the leaders  of  the Jewish  community and the  Imam  of  the mosque.   While these  enquiries were  being made  a crowd  of about 200 Arabs and Jews  collected  near the  mosque.   The leader of  the Jewish community agreed  that  the windows  of the  Jewish house nearest the mosque  should be permanently  closed  so that  filth could not  be thrown  from them and  stated that  he would have the work  carried  out the  next  day.   The  crowd which  had collected was  told that an  agreement  had been  arrived at.    It  dispersed and by  6.15 p.m. all  was quiet.&apos;       3.  . At  6.45  p.m.,  the Police Inspector heard a Police whistle  in the  Zaffran  Road.    He  sent  all available Police  to  the  vicinity of the mosque where he found crowds  of Jews and  Arabs  indulging in stone throwing.    He cleared the  road but  at about  7.15 p.m. similar  trouble  broke out all over the  Jewish quarter.  The Arabs were  throwing stones  at Jews  and Jewish  houses  and the  Jews were retaliating by throwing stones  and bottles.   Reports                                                           were
                                                               9 0 0                                                               kt (0 were received that Jews were being attacked on the Syra seafront and at Holkat Bay.   The Armed Police were called out and posted in and round the Jewish quarter and squads were sent to Syra and Holkat Bay in taxis.   I and the AssistantCommandant of Police did not get information of the troubletill 7.30 p.m.   We arrived in the Crater a little before8 p.m. &quot;&apos; wherever crowds had collected they were dispersed.Armed Police squads were posted at strategic points and astrong patrol was kept moving about the disturbed area.   Crowdswhich were dispersed did not reform and by 11 p.m. all was quiet.     4.-   On the morning of Tuesday the 24th, there was notrouble of a serious nature.   Arab, Somali and Indian boysindulged in stone throwing keeping the town in a state ofexcitement.   The Jews added to the excitement and uneasinessas they had done the previous night by constantly blowing &quot;Policewhistles&quot; and keeping squads of Police moving from place to place.The loafer element showed a tendency to form into crowds, but were dispersed and by midday the Town was fairly quiet.   Duringthe course of the morning I received a telephone report thatthere had been 3 cases of Arabs throwing stones at Jews atShaikh Othman.   I sent the Assistant Commandant of Police tomake enquiries and ordered a squad of 10 Armed Police t i go toShaikh Othman.   There was no further trouble, but there was a feeling of uneasiness and I was forced to keep the Armed Policesquad there.     5.   On Tuesday afternoon  everything was quiet in theCrater until about 6.30 p.m. when  I received a report thata bottle of beer had been found in the mosque of ShaikhAbdulla during evening prayers.    There was a greatexcitement  over this incident.   This bottle could nothave been thrown  in by Jews as  alleged without breaking                                                      and
and one is forced, to the conclusion that it was deliberatelyplaced in the mosque by a Mohamedan with the idea of causingtrouble.   By 7 p.m. there were affrays and stone throwing allover the town.   Crowds were dispersed wherever found butseveral mobs of loafers 30 or 40 strong kept on the  move stoninJewish houses and stoning the police.   Several Jewishhouseholds added to the confusion by constant whistling and,presumably in panic, throwing stones and bottles at  the Police.Quiet was restored by about 11.30 p.m.6-.     Wednesday morning opened by a Jew stabbing a  Somalimilkman who had centered the Jewish quarter in the course ofhis work.   This incident took place at 6.30 a.m.   A largeMoslem crowd entered the Jewish quarter breaking into thelower stories of Jewish houses to cause damage and to loot.The Jews retaliated by throwing stones and bottles fromwindows and roofs.     The Assistant Commandant of Policewas quickly on the scene and cleared the street but  largecrowds had collected.    Icameto the conclusion thatthe presence of Armoured Cars might have a steadyinginfluence and 1 asked for their assistance.    At thisperiod,  crowds of hooligans were moving about the Craterlooting Jewish shops.    With the Police, armed and  unarmedat my disposal,  it was impossible to guard every street.Large numbers of arrests were made, and mobs were broken up.    By 11.30 a.m. there was no active disorder but theTown was in a state of great excitement, and feeling was runnin very high.    The Armoured Cars were allowed  to go before midday.    I asked for an obtained an order underSection 144 Criminal Procedure Code from the District                                                  Magistrate
Magistrate to close all shops,  coffee shops,  and eatinghouses between the hours of 6 p.in. and 6 a.in. for 7  days.   Byimidday the Armed and Unarmed Police who had had no rest sinceMonday were in a state of exhaustion and could not carry onwithout rest.   Rest was imperative and I was forced to ask for Military assistance.7.    On Wednesday afternoon at 5 p.rn. 2 Armoured Gars and3 British Officers and 50 other Ranks of the Aden ProtectorateLevies arrived in the Crater and I allowed half my men to  rest.All shops were closed at 6 p.m. and at night fall the Policecleared the streets surrounding the Jewish locality.   Allremained quiet in the Crater but I received a telephone reportthat 5 Jewish shops in Steamer Point had been broken into.   Isent a squad of Armed Police to help the Police there.   At  7 pI received a further report that the Police Station  had been stoned while those who had been arrested were being removed.I sent the Assistant Commandant of Police with a second squadof Armed police to restore order.   He restored order and the rev/as no further trouble in the Steamer Point area.8.    Wednesday night passed without any incidentsexcept that there were two or three cases of unprovokedstone-throwing from Jewish houses.   I was able to persuade the individuals at whom stones had been thrown to keep quiet.9.     On Thursday morning at 8 o&apos; clock the Armoured Cars leftCrater and by 10.30 p.m. the Aden Protectorate Levies had withdrawn.   All areas remained quiet.10.    On Friday, I started withdrawing the Armed Police fromaffected areas, and on Saturday all Armed Police were withdrawnat about 9 pjm.   On Sunday I requested the District Magistrateto permit shops etc. to remain open until the usual  hours andthe situation returned to normal.11.    During the disturbances one small Jewish synagoguev/as entered by Moslems and a certain amount of damage was                                                         done .
     done.  19  Jewish  shops and houses were broken open in the     Crater and 4  in Tawahi and property the value of which  I   is  not yet known  was taken hut it can safely he said that     in  only 3  or  4 cases was much taken.   Attempts were made on     34  Jewish  shops and houses hut the unruly mobs were not     able to break in.     12.        The total number of arrests was 123 including 11     Jews.   Happily the number of injured was small.   61 were     treated in Hospital (58 from Crater) of whom only 7 were     detained for  treatment.    The only serious case was the     Somali milkman who was stabbed by a Jew.   There v/e re 11 police     injured of whom one was detained in Hospital for treatment.tails shown)    There  were no deaths.   The number of injurecFby attached   ) tement     )    religions is as under:-                      Jews.......23                      Moslem.....38 - including 11 Police.     13.        I  am glad to be able to report that the situation     was never  out of  control.   It was unfortunate that these     disturbances  should have occurred when the Armed Police     were under strength, 32  recruits for the Indian Branch  of     the Armed  Police  not having arrived from  India.     Both the     Unarmed and Armed branches worked extremely well and were     absolutely impartial in their treatment of unruly crowds.     The Jews were given every possible protection, although  at     times  the  Police  were stoned  and had bottles thrown at  them     from Jewish houses while patrolling the Jewish quarter.     On  the Wednesday  I was forced to ask for  Military aid as     the Police required  rest and  I had not sufficient men to     provide  reliefs.   The Aden Protectorate  Levies not  only     provided two  strong  pickets  in the disturbed areas but  took     over the Residency,  Treasury, and Jail Guards and the     emergency  guards  I had posted on the Crater Post  Office  and     the National  Bank of  India.    Even  if the Armed Police  had                                                             been
been up to full strength I could not have coped with thesituation without Levy help - not because of the gravity ofthe situation but because of shortage of men.14.       There are 2 Armoured cars in Aden.    I understandthat a single Armoured Car is not permitted to enter adisturbed area - hence it follows that if one of these 2cars is for any reason off the road, the other is notavailable, and armoured car assistance is impossible.                         I have, etc.,                          (Sgd.) R. H. HASLAM                        Commandant  of Police, Aden.
