Appreciation of the  Political  Situation bythe Government  of  India, dated 21st June  1932.          Circulated for the information  of  the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the political  Situation in India,  dated 21st June 1932,  issued -on the authority of the Secretary of  State for India.           Shortly after  this appreciation is written, theperiod will expire of  the Ordinances promulgated  on the revival of Civil Disobedience Movement, and it may he ofinterest briefly to review events of the past six months and to attempt an estimate of the present situation.          The position six months ago was one of considera-ble danger and uncertainty.   The Congress had beenpreparing for months for an intensive campaign against theGovernment, and in two Provinces they had carried theirpreparations to a point at which orderly government was seriously menaced.   In the United Provinces,  a movementhad been launched against the payment of rent and land revenue, and activities had reached the stage at whichprompt and drastic action was necessary in order to preventwidespread adoption of the methods ,which carried a strongappeal,to millions of  the rural population,  who were feelingthe strain of almost unprecedented economic conditions.Action was taken in the middle of December,  and by thebeginning of 1932, although the extent of the trouble that,                       &apos;f, &apos;                            , :f i  .3might occur was still  uncertain, a very effective blow hadbeen struck at the organisation responsible for themovement.        In the North-West Frontier Province,  the danger was somewhat different.  The chances of widespreadagrarian trouble were  not so great,  although instigationof the rural population was part of the plan.    The motivesof influence were religion and nationalism,  the latter                                             sometimes
sometimes assuming in name All-India objectives, but more often appealing to the pride and prejudice of the Pathans,Personal equation was more in evidence, and Abdul C-haffar Khanhad established his influence in certain parts of theProvince to an extent which subsequent events proved to bevery great.  His creed was independence, and his appeal wasto the hatred of the Englishman and his rule.  Hisorganisation consisted of very large bodies of volunteers whoparaded in semi-military fashion and who, on many occasions,attempted to usurp the functions of administration. Tolerancewas carried by the Government to the utmost extremes,  untilthe situation at the end of December constituted such a menace to the maintenance of law and order that it was not possiblefor the Government to hold their hand any longer. the challenge was taken up on December 24th.      A few days later Gandhi returned to India from London.He arrived at a time when his avowed lieutenants in united provinces and North-West Frontier Province had placed him in a position from which he could neither extricate himself northe Government could extricate him.  Terrorist activities in bengal had also compelled action by the Government of a character which Gandhi could not publicly approve withoutoffending his followers. He attempted to temporise, but the issues were so grave as to preclude the Government from allowingany doubt or uncertainty to prevail regarding their intentions.Gandhi had to come down on one side or the other and when he approved of the general renewal of civil disobedience he camedown (possibly against his own inclinations) on the side ofanarchy.      The reply of Government was the assumption of Extra-                                                 ordinary
ordinary Powers &quot;by a  series of  Ordinances  issued on January4th, and the launching of  comprehensive action against activeorganisations sand members  of  Congress.    This action generally  has attained the objects it was expected to achieve.  In some cases  it has exceededexpectations.  In the United Provinces firm action and constant&apos;vigilance  have prevented what might  have  been an agrarianrevolution.   In the  North West Frontier  Province, few who were-acquainted with the potential dangers of  the  position would havebeen sanguine enough  to predict that the  situation would havebeen brought under control.with very little bloodshed and  thatit would have been possible  to  inaugurate a reformed constitu-tion a  few months after  the  commencement  of such action.  Theabsence of trouble in the  Punjab tends to obscure theadministrative wisdom by which  dangers have been avoided,inherent in a Province where well-being and contentment of avirile population are bound up  with  agricultural values, wherecommunal influences may affect  the course of  action of large sections of people, and where incidents of little intrinsicimportance rouse forces which may have grave  consequence.Bombay Presidency has had  peculiar difficulties in Bombay City,but elsewhere,  and particularly in Gujerat, the centre ofCivil Disobedience in 1930, there has been no doubt from thefirst that Congress was effectively  under control.  And so for other Provinces.  Every local Government obtained initiativeat the beginning of the campaign g,nd has  retained it ever since.There has been no hesitation to  take action,  no doubt regardingthe main line of policy,  and no relaxation of effort.       A charge often made is that the powers conferred by theordinances were in excess of the requirements and that India isgroaning under  ordinance rule.  Reference will be  made later to one aspect of  this.   Admittedly,  the   powers  taken were                                                  drastic
drastic, and they have been used for the purpose for whichthey were intended, namely, to show that Civil Disobediencecannot  succeed against organised resources of the state.  Butthere are a few facts which it is relevant to remember.    First,   There has been complete absence of instances inwhich the powers have been abused by their employment against persons who were not engaged in Civil Disobedience.    Second.   Little more than one person in ten thousandhas been prosecuted in connection with Civil Disobedience, and less than one in twenty thousand has been prosecuted underordinances.   It may safely be said that in at least  ninetyout of one hundred villages in India the ordinances have hadno practical effect whatever.        Third.   Possession of these powers has unquestionablyprevented loss of life and property and has much diminishedthe necessity of forcible action.       Fourth.   The record of executive action is a cleanone.    It would be unreasonable to claim that there have been no instances of excessive action, but, looking back over thepast six months, regrettable incidents have been singularlyfew.    The best proof of this is the great difficultyCongress is experiencing in finding material with any basisof truth for propaganda purposes.   The charges which havebeen proved to be falsely brought against certain policesubordinates of Benares for alleged ill-treatment of women    )are evidence of lack of material.      Fifth.   Use of the Ordinances has been according to requierements and has been on a diminishing 3cale.   proof of this is afforded by the figures for convictions, which include those under ordinary law, as well as under the                                           Ordinance s.
Ordinances.   They are as  follows:- January 14800, February17,800, Karen 6900, April  5300.   Complete figures for May arenot available, but they will probably show a further drop.        In April last, the Government of India asked local governments  to inform   them of the state of feeling in thecountry, having regard to  the frequent allegations that therewas a widespread state of  sullen resentment, owing to themeasures the Government were taking against the Civil Disobedienc emovement.    The reports have now been received, and representthe views of the Local Governments,  based largely on the appreciation of District Officers throughout India. Onlysalient features can be given here,  but the material is ofgreat interest and value.   There is a remarkable unanimity onthe main issues,  and general conclusions may be summarisedas follows:-    (a)   An overwhelming proportion of the population is not         concerned with the Civil Disobedience movement at all.         The vast ma ority of the villages are entirely         unaffected.    (b)   Towns are more affected than the villages, but         interest is confined to particular classes.    (c)   The movement,  having regard to its origin naturally         commands the sympathy of Hindus rather than the other         communities -  but even so,  the proportion of Hindus         actively interested in it is small.  The Punjab                                                      *r .. i  if].         Government,  for instance,  say 90% of Hindus in that         province show little sympathy for it.   A Commissioner         in Bombay says that in his division,  which is strongly         Hindu,  about b% only of the population are sympathetic.         On the other hand, Central Provinces Government says         most Hindus in the province,are, in greater or                                                      less
 less  degree,  in  sympathy.   Other  provinces vary.  On the whole enquiry has  shown that,  even among Hindus, the  interest of the great majority does  not  exterd  &quot;beyond  sentiment and very la:ege numbers are  indifferent.   The classes mostly affected are the educated middle  classes,  students,  teachers, petty&apos; intelligentsia of the  towns, and  educated unemployed.   (d)   Muhammadans  are  generally opposed - so are the landowners, a  considerable  portion of  the business community and Depressed  Classes.   (e)   The measures taken by the Government have had a very heartening effect on Government servants and supporters of the Government.    There  is  throughout the country increased respect for authority  and,  often a feeling of relief among the people that action has  been taken.   (f)   There is complete agreement that the alleged general state of sullen resentment  is a propagandist myth. There is some  resentment,   but it  is  confined to very small sections of the population - Congress organisers, relations of thosewho have been  punished - the irreconcilables and some of tb4 lawyer class who dislike rule by Ordinances on principle. Such  feeling as there  is affects a very small proportion of the population.   (g)  On the other hand,  there is support for the view thata factor in the situation is doubt and suspicion regarding the course of  constitutional reforms.   This particularly affects the educated classes, and extends far beyond those who  approve of civil disobedience.   It largely explains the sentimentalregard for Congress held by many who condemn their methods. Theposition is summed up by one Local Government as follows: - &quot;Moderate political opinion is prepared to accept thepresent repressive measures as a necessary evil, but only on                                                     the
      the assumption that they are temporary expedients      to prepare the ground for constitutional advance which is      generally considered overdue5&apos;.     Situation at present is thus one in which Government havethe movement under control and the initiative is with them andnot with. Congress.   But all local Governments agree that thetime has not arrived for any relaxation of effort. Congress have still much power for mischief in many parts of the country andthey would he quick to take advantage of any opportunity thatwas allowed them.   The comparatively small support they arenow getting is due to the growing belief that they cannotsucceed.  If any grounds were givem for the idea  that theGovernment would weaken, there would be a rapid change in their favour.  They are,  for instance, hoping that fresh powers willnot be taken when the Ordinances lapse, and that  an opportunitywill be given them to revive their attack.  In the absence ofany new factor which will give a stimulus to the movement, itis mainly a question as to how much longer their  efforts can be sustained.  The process of attrition has already gone aconsiderable way, and experience of similar movements in thepast indicates that, when once this happens, it requires a powerful stimulus to revive active interest.          It cannot be assumed that such a stimulus will not be forthcoming.  The next few months will presumably see a      icommunal decision and it is not possible to predict consequentreactions.   Communal tension is very&apos;acute and it isquite.,certain that, whatever the decision may be, it will notplease all communities.    If resentment goes beyond vocalprotests it may take the form of active support to Congress byclasses who have so far abstained from overt action.  On the                                                         other
other hand, it may lead to further communal strife.  Feelingsare strained in many parts of the country am slight incidentsmay cause  serious disturbances of local character. In thisconnection it may he noted that during the past fifteen monthsthere have been three communal disturbances in different partsof the country of very serious dimensions.  First was inCawnpore,  Second was in Kashmir, where the trouble extendedover a large area.   There was considerable loss of life andgreat damage to property.  The unusual feature was the largenumber villages affected and the rapidity with which the trouble spread.   Lastly, there has been the recent trouble in bombay, where the casualties exceeded 2,000 and where feeling is still extremely bitter.       Another factor which may easily influence th.esituation is the course of constitutional reforms. Ifthese proceed smoothly and satisfy the moderate elements inthe country, they will continue to operate as a very powerfulforce on the side of the Government against civil disobedience.If, on the other hand, they give occasions for widespreaddissatisfaction they may prove to be a disturbing instead^of a stabilising factor.         While the situation at the moment is, thereforesatisfactory,  it has to be realised that new forces may comeinto play which will give civil disobedience the stimulus forwhich its supporters are hoping.
