                  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC                           MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERRl/LjHr.:;ORETR.248 (32)           IRISH FREE STATE SITUATION.         Copy No.  9 -          Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.                   There are various points in connection v/ith          the Irish Free State Situation to which I think that          the attention of the Cabinet should be called before the          United Kingdom Delegation leaves for the Ottawa Conference.              1.   Issue of an Order under the Irish Free State          (Special Duties) Bill.                   It will be remembered that the Cabinet, at their          meeting on July 6th, approved the draft of the          proposed Order to be made by the Treasury under the          Irish Free State (Special Duties) Bill but decided to          defer a decision as to its issue until this week.          (The draft Order has been circulated as CP.236(32)).          On the assumption that the decision will be the          immediate issue of the Order, the question arises          whether it would not be as well to publish concurrently *          a short statement of the position of the Government          here which would explain, in the simplest terms possible,          what the present position is.   I have been thinking over          the form which such an announcement might take,and I circu-          late as  Appendix I a draft for consideration of the                                                       Cabinet.
Cabinet.    2. possible developments after the issue ofthe Order.           It is, of course, extremely difficultto foresee what may happen, but it is obviouslypossible that shortly after the issue of theOrder (or even before it takes effect - which,  Iunderstand, would be Friday, 15th July at theearliest) Mr. de Ye!era may send a reply to thelatest despatch which I sent to him, either     (i) accepting arbitration by a Commonwealth         Tribunal in regard to the Land Annuities,         or    (ii) prolonging negotiations, or   (iii) suggesting further personal discussion.           The question accordingly arises - what should.be the attitude of the Government here inrelation to any of these contingencies?           I have thought over the matter, and onthe whole the beat line to take seems to be asfollows:-     fa) As regards (i) above, in the event ofKr. de &quot;Valera accepting arbitration by a commonwealth Tribunal of the nature envisaged bythe Imperial Conference of 1930, the order mightbe forthwith suspended - even though agreement hadnot been reached as to arbitration on the other financial issues, and even though consequently weshould be out of pocket on that account.                                             On
           On the other hand we should, I think,press for the amounts outstanding in connectionwith the land Annuities to ho paid over to someinstitution not primarily connected with either ofthe two countries, e.g. the Bank of Montreal.     (b) As regards (ii) and (iii) above, theOrder should, I thinly only be suspended, andoontinuance of negotiations, or further personaldiscussions, accepted if the reply showed realevidence of a desire to reach a satisfactory agreement.   Otherwise the Order should remain inforce.    The considerations mentioned under (3)below may have a bearing on the position.     (3) Procedure in the event of arbitrationover the financial issues being; accepted byMr. tie Valera.           Even if Mr. da Valera accepts theprinciple of arbitration by a CommonwealthTribunal, there is likely to be a good deal of trouble over the settlement of the terms ofreference, and over the composition of theTribunal.           For example, I have heard privatelythat discussions have been going on in Dublinbetween Mr. V. J. Patel, the Indian Nationalistpolitician who used to be president of theLegislative Assembly, and Mr. de Valera.   It isquite true, of course, that Mr. Patel would not be qualified    within the meaning of the                                         Imperial
Imperial Conference of 1930 as to the Commonwealth Tribunal,since he has not held &quot;high judicial office&quot;, nor is he a&quot;distinguished jurist&quot; , and his name would certainlj&apos; not&quot;carry weight throughout the British Commonwealth&quot;,,    Onthe other hand, he or some other extreme Indian politicianmight conceivably be nominated by the Irish Free Stateunder Recommendation 3(b).         My own feeling would be that it would be best to arrange, if possible, for the terms of reference to besettled - at any rate in principle - between the twoGovernments before proceeding to deal with the question ofthe personnel of the Tribunal.     4.   position of the Governor-General.    This hasassumed prominence by reason of the publication in thepress of today of the correspondence exchanged between mr.  de Valera and the Governor-General.   The extractfrom the &quot;Times&quot; containing this correspondence is reproduced as Appendix II.          This is not a matter in which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the united Kingdom are in a position to intervene officially, but the following notes, whichhave been prepared in consultation with the Attox^neyGeneral, maythrow some light on possible developments.
                                                              V          There are three alternattveatfl ha aon-sixLered.      (1) Mr.  de Valera may take no official action.In this event, one of two conclusions may he drawn(a) that he must, in accordance with accepted constitutionalprinciples, he held in the last resort to have assumed responsibility for the action of Mr ,McUe;i 11 in publishing the correspondence or(b) that, in matters purely affecting the personal dignity ofa Governor General, there are limits to the doctrine of theconstitutional responsibility of Ministers.      (2) Mr. de Valera may formally advise the King to dismiss Mr. McNeill on the ground that lie has published the correspondence contrary to the advice of hi s Mini stars.  Asa result of the Imperial Conference of 1930, Mr. de Valera isconstitutionally in a position to tender such advice.  It isnot suggested that this is one of those cases in which it is necessarily the King&apos;s duty to accept the advice.  On theother hand, if Ki s Majesty were to refuse the advice,Mr. de Valera would be faced with the alternatives of accepting the position, or resigning, or asking for a dissolution, andthe question arises whether it would be&apos;desirable to create the opportunity for a General Election in circumstances wherethe merits of the case might well be obscured by theconstitutional issue of acceptance of  ministerial adviceby the King.      (3) Mr. de Valera may approach the Governor general with a view to securing his resignation..   This is not a                                           si tuati on
situation in which Mini ministers are entitled to give their advice to the Governor General or to require that heshould accept it.  They may however discuss the matter with the Governor General and make their wishes knownto him. In that event if Mr. McNeill is willing to resignhe would presumably reply that he was prepared to tenderhis resignation to the King, but that he must abide byHis Majesty&apos;3 decision.  If he were not willing to resignthen he would presumably reply that he was not preparedto tender his resignation, and that, if his Ministers wishto pursue the matter, it would be necessary for them to approach the King.          It Bhould be added that the present  positionis that,  in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor General, the Chief Judge of the Irish FreeState will act, or in his absence the Senior Judge for thetime being of the Irish Free State Supreme Court.(intld.)

31 0it)                         APPENDIX I.                      DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT.           The  Treasury  have to-day issued an Order under the  Irish Free  State  (Special Duties) Act providing for a duty of........%  on  certain specified articles imported into the  United Kingdom from the Irish Free State..           His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom desire to make  it  clear that their decision that this Order should he issued immediately after the passing of the Act has  &quot;been made in consequence of the losses already  sustained  to  the revenue Of the United Kingdom owing to  the non-payments by Hi s Majesty1 s Government in the Irish Free  State  of certain Amounts which have already fallen due under the various agreements between the two Governments.           The approximate amounts due,  and not paid,  are as follows: -                                                     Land Annuities                           1,243,000   Royal Irish Constabulary, pensions.          93,000   Civil pensions.                              10,000   Local Loans Fund Annuity.                   300,000   Works Annuities           (a) Telegraph Acts                    4,000           (b) public Offices Site (Dublin)                                   Act.         13,000In addition the following further amounts fall due during the next three months: -
1 JL   Land Annuities                          240,000   Royal Irish. Constabulary pensions       280,000   Civil Pensions                           15,000   Works Annuities        (a) Telegraph Acts                   4,000        (b) Railways (Ireland Act) arid            Marine Works (Ireland) Act       6,000.          In the circumstances His Majesty&apos;s government felt that no cour-se was open to them other than theimmediate issue of this Order.          At the same time His Majesty1 s Government in theUnited Kingdom wish it to be most clearly understood thatthe offer of arbitration on the Land Annuities which they made to lvlr.de Valera on 10th June still holds good.  this offer was to submit the legal questions involved to arbitration of the nature envisaged in the Summary of proceedings of the Imperial Conference of 1930 under the heading &quot;Commonwealth Tribunal&quot;.          Mr. de Valera has so far refused to accept a tribunal of this nature, though His Majesty&quot; s Government inthe United Kingdom have made it clear to him that, inorder to arrive at an amicable settlement, they are readyto consider any variation in the form of Tribunal which    )His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Pree State may wishto suggest, so long as its members are drawn from withinthe British Commonwealth.          His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomalso wish to make the position clear as regards the paymentsoutstanding other than the Land Annuities.  It is as follows.  .,,- . ... .  .                                         His
           Ill s Majeaty&apos; a  Government  have not  beeninformed of the grounds  on which the  liability  of theIrish Free State  in  respect  of  these  payments isdisputed.  If, hov/ever,  they can  be given an indication of the grounds upon  which the agreements relating tothem are  challenged  and  are  considered suitable for reference to  arbitration, His Majesty&apos;s Government will consider  the  possibility of  agreeing  to the arbitrationof these  questions on the same  basis  and by the sameTribunal  as they  have already proposed in the case of theLand Annuities.   They have so informed Mr. de Valera.          His Majesty&apos;s  Government also wish to make itabundantly clear  that they have no intention of-collecting under  the present Order, or any subsequentOrder, larger amounts than those  required to make up thepayments by the Irish Free State which have alreadyfallen due or are likely to  fall  due.          Lastly  His Majesty&apos;8  Government desire tomake it plain that they greatly regret the necessity whichhas compelled them to issue  this Order.   Their sincerewish has been, and is, for an amicable settlement of thefinancial issues which have  arisen between this countryand the Irish Free State.  They cannot,  however,disregard their duty to the people of the United Kingdom.
                  APPENDIX.   II.                  MR. DE VALERA.             LETTERS F&quot;QOM MR.  McNEILL.          APOLOGY DEMANDED FOR &quot;DISCOURTESY&quot;.                    From our own Correspondent.                                         DUBLIN,  July 10.     The following correspondence between the  Governor-Generalof the Free State and Mr. de Valera,  President of the ExecutiveCouncil, was issued for publication this evening  by theGovernor-General                               Vice-Regal Lodge,  Dublin.                                 April  26,  1932.     Dear Mr. President, -   I should like te  draw your     attention to a statement made  on the Irish Press yesterday     a report of the dance given by the  Minister  of the French     Republic on Saturday last ends as follows.-          &quot;Later the Governor-General arrived.   This was  a     surprise, and Mr. 0&apos;Kelly and  Mr. Aiken then left.&quot;          There is no doubt as te the meaning  of  that     categorical statement.    It conveys to the  public that     two members of the Executive Council did  not know that I     intended to be present at the  dance, and  that they left     the dance in consequence of my presence.   There are     reports in other papers of gossiping comments at the  dance     regarding the departure of the Ministers.   The statement     of the Irish Press is not a report  of gossipj  also the     Irish Press is known to be under your personal control,     and statements of the kind to  which I refer  in that     newspaper can only mean that it  is  part of a considered     policy that the Governor-General should be treated with     deliberate discourtesy by members of your Council and by
n 4 M6 (          I have looked at to-day&apos;s  copy of  the  Irish Press     to see if any farther statement was published which     would modify the impression made by the statement  in     Monday&apos;s paper.     There is merely additional     publicity.    In the absence of any explanation I  must     protest against  the offensive conduct of the Ministers     and the use of your party newspaper to  assist them.   I     think that while I am Governor-General  you  and  the     members of your Council cannot  choose public occasions     to behave with discourtesy, whether or not  the  Irish     Press gives added publicity to their conduct.                        Yours truly,                                    JAMES MCNEILL.     A letter dated April 30 was received from thePresident of the Executive Council.     It was marked&quot;personal&quot; and is not for publication.    The correspondencecontinued:-
                               VICE-REGAL LODGE, DUBLIN,                                     May 2, 19-32.     Dear Mr. President, Having carefully consideredyour letter of April 30 in all its parts, I think thatan apology from you and the two Ministers concerned isdue not merely on my personal or official account hutwith regard to the honour and self-respect of Irishpublic life.                      Yours truly,                                  JAMES MCNEILL.             MR. DE VALERA&apos;S REPLY.         Department of the President, Dublin,                                          May 7, 1932.     Dear Governor-General, I duly received your letter of May 2, and have given it careful consideration.In my previous letter to you I made it clear that I re-garded the whole affair as unfortunate and regrettable,and one that should not have been permitted to occur.    tFurther than this I am unable to go.                        Faithfully yours,                                   EAMON DE VALERA.
                                                            319                                     VICE-REGAL LODGE, DUBLIN,                                         May 24, 1932.   Dear Mr. President, In accordance v/ith your desireconveyed to ine &quot;by Mr0 Walshe some weeks ago, I deferred theissue of invitations to a number of European Catholics tobe my guests during the Eucharistic Congress.   As the time had drawn near I asked Mr, Talshe a few days ago to come and see me on the matter, and I received from him with much sur-prise your message that the issue of invitations would causeembarrassment to the Government.   I have great difficulty inunderstanding how embarrassment to the Government could arise from the presence as my guests in the Vice-Regal Lodge of thesedistinguished Catholics.   I feel that embarrassment, if itshould arise, would not be sufficient to justify me in failing to make the contribution to the Congress which I had already arranged.   I have already sent invitations to English Catholicswhich have been accepted.   I regret that your Government is unable to assist me in inviting other visitors.                         Yours truly,                                    JAMES MCNEILL.                         /&quot;copy-7                                          July 7, 1932.    Dear Mr. President, Immediately before and also during theEucharistic Congress I thought it undesirable to make any furtherprotest regarding the discourtesy with which you and your Ministerhave treated me.    On April 26, I wrote a letter asking for anapology for the French Legation incident.   On April 30 you wroteme a lengthy reply in v/hich you refused my request for an apology.
For some reason you marked the letter &quot;Personal&quot;.    Ireplied on May 2 and dealt with no part of your letterexcept the refusal.   I merely repeated my request.But I shall be grateful if you can see your way topublishing the &quot;personal&quot; letter for general information.Your newspaper glories in the insult, but made, I  think,no statement about the apology to the French Minister.You replied to my letter of May 2 on May 7.
     &quot;EMBARTiASSI^EMT&quot; TO GOVERNMENT.        In the  time of Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s Government I had asked for and received official help in inviting distinguishedforeigners to public functions.   Early in this year I washelped by the Department of  External Affairs to get addressesof distinguished Catholics and other useful particularsabout them.   Soon after you became Minister for ExternalAfiairs I enquired if further help could be given.   Mr.Walshe,the secretary to the Department, called and told mepersonally that you wished me to wait a short ti-ie, thoughif invitations  were to be sent further delay was at the timeundesirable.    I waited some weeks.   Further enquiry by meresulted in another visit, in which Mr. Walshe informed me from you that invitation of guests to the Vice-Regal Lodgein Congress week would embarrass your Government.          I replied in writing to that message and informedyou that I had, even after the unnecessary delay, decided toissue invitations.   I think your message,conveyed verballyby a Civil servant, was more than discourteous.   It suggested a profound ignorance of the duty you owed to the people inconnexion with  the Congress.   You had no right whatsoeverto send such a  message even if you had carefully refrained from putting it in writing.          Before the Cardinal Legate&apos;s arrival the Lord Mayorapplied to the Ministry of Defence for help in making the   )civic reception worthy of the great occasion.   In connexionwith this the Lord Mayor had a personal interview with Mr.Aiken, the Minister for Defence.   Mr. Aiken sought to imposeconditions as regards the presence of the Army band at thecity&apos;s reception on Monday, June 27, of the Cardinal Legate,Cardinals, and  others, including the Governor-General.
                                                     3^ 5)He wished to know if the Governor-General was  to hepresent before the Army band, consisting of membersof the State&apos;s Army, could be permitted to be  presentand trumpeters provided to play a fanfare in honour  of the cardinal Legate.   The band is not the property of youor Mr. Aiken, or of any political party.   The Armyband which was asked for by the Lord Mayor on  behalfof the citizens, was not present.   It v/as absentbecause the Lord Mayor could not agree to the  Governor-General&apos; s exclusion from a civic reception of  a non-party character.
There have been other things.   I know that the Ministry&apos;attitude effects my relations with the Diplomatic Corps,sometimes unexpectedly.   I do not question your legal rightto omit to ask me to the State reception to the CardinalLegate, and naturally I did not ask for the admission ofmy stranger guests.   I never sought any public honour.I am willing to return to private life when my acceptance ofpublic duty is displeasing to a majority either of the Dailor of the people.   But I do not think I should resign anyoffice because other office-holders think I am a suitabletarget for Ill-conditioned bad manners.       &quot;CALCULATED   DISCOURTESY&quot;I know that you have a majority in the Dail.   I know that you can have me removed.   I have arranged that this letter and all the correspondence, except your letter marked&quot;Personal,&quot; shall be published within t?aree days unless Ireceive apologies here from you and the other ministers who have sometimes openly and sometimes otherwise sought tobehave with calculated discourtesy to the Governor-General,from whom you accepted confirmation of your appointments.When your Government came into office I had no intention of doing anything but discharging my duty in exactly the same way as I had hitherto done.   You have made it necessary forme to explain to my countrymen that without any change jotprinciple I have not suddenly become a coward on account ofthe attractions of an honourable office.   You will, I am sure, have no difficulty In finding a Governor-General whowill accept the post on the conditions which you regard ashonourable.   I am sorry that you have chosen  for the occasiof your political demonstration a supreme act of religiousworship in which the Irish nation was united with the wholeCatholic world.                   Your obedient servant,                            (Signed) JAMES McNeill.                           8.
                     (COPY)                                          July 8,  1952.Dear Governor-General. - I have submitted your letter  ofJuly 7 to the Executive Council for consideration.   The ExecutiveCouncil is surprised that the Governor-General should  proposeto publish letters -which have passed bet-ween him and the Presidentof the Executive Council.   Communications between the Presidentof the Executive Council and the Governor-General are  confidentialState documents.   The Executive Council is not prepared to create the precedent of permitting the Governor-General to publish such documents, and I hereby convey to your Excellency the  formaladvice and direction of the Executive Council not to publish the letters in question.                              Faithfully yours,                                   EATON DE VALERA.                      COPY                                           July 9,  1932.Dear Mr. President. - I received yesterday evening by  yourmessenger your letter of the 8th inst.,  in which you state thatcommunications between the President of the Executive  Counciland the Governor-General are confidential.    I have objected in myletters to the acts of the President and his Ministers as unjustified-fiable and offensive.   In the case of affronts,  however outrageous,by the President and some members of the Executive  Council to theGovernor-General there is, in your Council&apos;s opinion,  no course open to me but silent acceptance.   It must surely  be  evident toyou that you and your Council are the only people in Ireland -whothink that the course you suggest is honourable.    I think that                                 9o
only you and your Council will be surprised at  ray  decision tohave an apology made to me as an alternative to my removal from my office.     I note that you are silent about  Mr.  Aiken&apos;s  misconductin his interview with the Lord Mayor of Dublin.   Having  addressedyou on the subject and received no answer, I am still  supposed to regard my statement as confidential.    The correspondenceother than your letter marked &quot;Personal&quot; will be published.                               Yours faithfully,                                    JAMES  MCNEILL.
