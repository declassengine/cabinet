HIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT). E C R E T- .,P.227 (32).COPY NO           CABINET.THE SITUATION IN THE IRISH FREE STATE.THE LAND ANNUITIES:  PROPOSED ACTION.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Dominion                     Affairs.1.      In accordance with the arrangement reported to the   Cabinet on the 22nd June (Cabinet  37(32)  Conclusion 2),  I   circulate to my colleagues (Annex  I) a Memorandum (I.S.C.   (32)36) already circulated to the  Irish Situation Committee   and (Annex II) memoranda prepared  by the Board of Customs  in   consultation with other Departments concerned (Appendix I),   the Board of Inland Revenue&apos; (Appendix II),  the Treasury   (Appendix III) and the Board of Trade (Appendix IV) as  to   the possible nature and effects of special measures designed   to recoup to the United Kingdom Exchequer the sum likely to   be withheld by the Irish Free State on account of Land   Annuities.2.      It will be seen from the memorandum in Appendix I that it   does not seem possible to devise a tariff to yield  3,000,000   a year the whole burden of which would fall on the Irish Free   State producer.    It is however estimated that the sum in   question could be obtained from a  selective tariff on certain   named commodities, some of which (namely those in the case of   which it is assumed that the main  burden would fall on  the   Irish Free State producer) would be dutiable at 25% ad  valorem,   and others (in the case of which it is assumed that the  main   burden would fall on the United Kingdom consumer)  at 15% ad   valorem, an alternative method would be a general  tariff at the   rate of 15% ad valorem on all Irish Free  State imports  into   the United Kingdom.
3.                I should however call attention, to  the  .        fact that in either case it is proposed to  impose        a duty of 15%,  estimated to produce   1-g millions,        or half of the  entire sum in question, on live        animals for food;  and that, for the reasons set        out in the memorandum, it is at least possible        that the greater part of this duty would be borne        by the United Kingdom consumer.   Furthermore it        is pointed out  that any duties on Irish Free State        products, especially any duties on livestock,        would case serious administrative difficulties  on        the border between the Irish Free State and        Northern Ireland.4.                From the memorandum prepared by the Board        of Inland Revenue (Appendix II) it appears that,        by terminating (as we are entitled to do at any        time) the Double Income Tax Agreement between        ourselves and the Irish Free State,  we could        secure for the Revenue a sum estimated at         1,000,000 a year without any appreciable loss to       . residents in this country, but that the Free State        Exchequer would also make a gain of  1,000,000        (at the expense of residents in the United Kingdom)        less any relief which it might give in respect of        the loss (estimated at  2,000,000 ayear) suffered        by residents in the Irish Free State.            )5.                As to this it should be observed that        the residents in the Irish Free State who would be        affected are those whose income is derived in whole        or in part from investments in the United Kingdom
    and it may fairly be assumed that they are  in    the main the &quot;loyalist&quot; class who support Mr.    Cosgrave and are violently opposed to Mr. de    Valera.   There are also among the &quot;loyalists&quot;    the double residents, a wealthy class though few    in number.   The majority of them are people    whose home and primary residence are in the    United Kingdom and who make themselves liable to    Free State tax merely by holiday visits to  that    country.   It is not improbable that Mr.  de    Valera might decline to use the  ml gained by the    Free State at the expense of United Kingdom    residents, in relief of the one class in the Free    State whom we are least anxious to hit.    But for    the most part the double residents can and will    keep themselves free in future from any liability    to Free State tax simply by not going there.    Moreover, of the residents in the Free State only,    many v/ill be able to adjust their affairs so as to    avoid the worst consequences of a denunciation of    the Agreement.6.           It is,  of course, possible that the Irish    Free State Government may themselves decide to ter-    terminate the Agreement but that is not at all likely.    On the other hand, I understand from the  Board of    Inland Revenue that it may in any case be necessary    for us before long to propose modifications in the    Agreement and in these circumstances the  Board    suggest that the inclusion of denunciation  in the    list of measures to be undertaken should  be seriously    consi dere d.
 7.     From the memorandum prepared by  the Treasury (Appendix III)  it will be seen that that Department is unable to suggest other sources from which we can derive any substantial sum from the  Irish Free State.  On the contrary, if,  as I hope is unlikely, the Irish Free State Government were to default on the  Eonls issued under their L Land Act of 1925 and guaranteed by us, a very formidable liability would be imposed upon the United Kingdom Exchequer. 8.      The memorandum prepared by  the Board of Trade (Appendix IV)  sets out the indirect effects, by way of repercussions on our own exports to  the Irish Free State, which might possibly arise from any action of the kind contemplated.   As to  this I do  not  suppose that any of us contemplate that  we  can recover  3,000,000 from the Irish Free  State without some  loss  to ourselves.  The best we can  do  is  to take  such measures as will be least damaging to our  own interests. 9.      It  seems  to me  that, on balance, a selective tariff on the  lines set  out  in  Appendix I would be the best,  or rather  the  least  disadvantageous, method of procedure, if we have  to  proceed to  recoup ourselves.  It would of course be possible to  secure.. 1,000,000 by  terminating the Double Income Tax Agreement  and  to adjust the proposed tariff by omitting,  or substantially lowering,the duty on livestock. Apart however from the disadvantages referred to inparagraph  5 above, of  terminating the Double Income Tax Agreement,  there  is the possibility, which must be seriously taken into  account, that  if wc omit from the tariff so obvious  an  item as livestock, and thereby make  it  plain that in our opinion a duty on  livestock would hurt us more  than it would hurt the  Irish Free State,  the Irish Free state may themselves impose  an  export tax on livestock,  and  there-
      by partially recoup themselves, at the.expense- of the      United Kingdom farmer and consumer, for their   loss on      other- commodities, such as butter and eggs, on which the      greater part of  the duty will be borne by the Irish Free      State producer.10.        I am assuming that, for the reasons set out in      paragraph   2 of  I.so.(32)36, it would be provided in any      legislation which may be introduced for the purpose of      imposing a  special tariff on Irish Free State imports,      that any such tariff would be in addition to, and would not      affect the  incidence of, the duties to which, in the absence      of any order to  the contrary, imports from the Irish Free      State will  be liable under the Import Duties Act after      November 15th.lt          As regards  the form of our legislation, I still think      that, for the reasons set out in paragraph 4 of 1.8.0.(32)36      it would be best for this to be confined tG  the grant      of a  general power to impose, vary or  remove duties on all      or any commodities imported from the Irish Free State,      leaving the details of the measures to  be  taken to be worked      out, and (  if necessary) put into  effect by administrative      Order, in the light of circumstances as they develop and,      in particular,  of the outcome of the correspondence now      proceding with  the Irish Free State.

Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Dominion                               Affairs.              7/e have to face the fact that the payment of  1,250,000      (approximately), due from the Irish Free State on account of the      Land Annuities before the 1st July, will not now be made,   &quot;k      further sum of  250,000 (approximately) is due by the middle of      August in respect of Sinking Fund^/.   I think therefore that      the Committee ought to consider forthwith the question whether      His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should take action      to  recoup itself for this loss and, if so, in what way.   It will      be  remembered that, in my speech in the House of Commons on Friday,      17th June I said, in reference to this point:-              &quot;we shall take whatever steps we deem necessary               to deal with that side of the situation.&quot;              2.  Action directed to this purpose would presumably have      to take either one or all of the following forms:-              (a) the imposition of special duties, directed                  against Irish Free State products as such,                  by means of ad hoc legislation.              (b) the levying of duties on Irish Free State                  products similar to those  payable by foreign                  countries under the Import Duties Act,                  either forthwith (i.e.  by ad hoc                  legislation)  or by our refraining from                  making an Order before November 15th                  under Section 4, sub-section 3 of the Act.                                   - 1 -
lllii miiimiiiiiMiii wi-iiHTimii    (o)  the  levying of duties  at  the  general rates on Irish Free        State  products at  present dutiable at preferential        rates .          Course (c)  has bean  mentioned for the sake ofcompleteness, v cut the amount which  we could obtain by its adoption  would, I  understand, be negligible./.          As between course (a)  and course (b),  it is to be  observed that,  if action of this  kind were taken for the purpose of  recouping ourselves for non-payment of the  hand Annuities,  we  should deprive  ourselves,  so far as the Irish Fre-eState is concerned, of a power which we specially reserved to ourselves under the  Import Duties Act,  viz. that of imposing duties  against such of the ISominions as ao not reciprocate by  way  of concessions at Ottawa.  prom this point of view this  course seems  unsuitable  to  deal with a quite different situation such as that which arises in relation to  the  Land annuities.          On the other hand, if we proceed by way of course  (a)  (i.e. the imposition of special duties)  the power at  (b)  i.e. the levying of duties under the Import Duties Act,  remains  in reserve and the  effects of a decision to exercise  it can be considered later.          My own feeling, therefore,  would be in favour of course  (a).  3.      I  have had a preliminary examination maae of the probable  effect of the levying of various duties on various commodities,  and I suggest that  the  departments more immediately concerned should  be  asked to consider the  whole field of  trade between the two countries, with  a view  to recommending what  duties on  what commodities
r/ould best secure the sum required with the least damage to Uriitedkingdom interests, cither from the effect of the duties themselves orfrom the point of view of possible retaliation.     4.    In the meantime,  the House of Commons will expect us to take some immediate action, which is the more uacessary in view of thepossibility of on early General Election in Ireland;   and in all thecircumstances I suggest that the best plan would be to secure theimmediate  passage of legislation giving the Government power by administrative order to impose (and also to remove) duties up to astated limit on all or any  commodities imported from the Irish FreeState.     5.    Such a procedure  v/ould seem to ire to have the following advantages: -     (a.)  it should satisfy  the House of Commons and the countrygener ally;     (b)  it would not be open to the criticism that the door to further negotiation v/ith the Irish  Free State Government was absolutely closed;     (c)  it could be applied to any future defaults by the Irish FreeState  Government In respect of payments due other then those inconnection with the Land Annuities;     (d) under such a procedure we should be able to fit the amountobtained from the duties levied exactly to the sum required;     (e)  it should have the maximum effect in the Irish FreeState,  as  no industry would know whether its exports to this countryTire to  be taxed, or for how long, or to what amount;     (f)  it should give-us  the maximum bargaining power as we should,be  in a position to lift the duties, or impose them again, whenever wepleased;     (g)  lastly, it should  improve the prospects of the Cosgrave Party,both now and at a General Flection, as they would be able tc tell theIrish  Free State electors that the duties would be removed as soonus  they  cane into power and resumed any payments withheld by thepresent  Government.

                                               APPENDIX I.SECRET,   1.  The problem is to raise  3 million a year by a  tariff on imports from the Irish Free State.    It is desirable thatthis sum should be really paid by the  Irish Free State, andnot by the United Kingdom consumers.    This means that thetariff must not raise prices (or lower qualities) against theUnited Kingdom.   2.  To achieve the latter results the tariff must be leviedon Irish Free State goods which are in active competition with supplies from other sources;  or, on Irish Free State  goods which find their only outlet in the United Kingdom,  and whichthe United Kingdom will not buy at increased prices.   3.  It can be said at once that a tariff fulfilling allthese conditions does not seem possible.   There is probablynothing of importance sent to the United Kin, dom from  theIrish Free State which is not in some  degree in competition with other supplies, and a tariff on the Free Statesupply would therefore be lively to fall more or less  onthe Irish Free State.   But it would be unreasonable to expect that the Free State supply could be taxed withoutthrowing some burden, somewhere, on the United Kingdomconsumers.   A striking instance is that of store cattle.  About40 per cent, of the net imports from the Free State consist of live animals for food, a large proportion of which  consists of  ;store cattle which are&quot;the raw material of the livestookindustry in Great Britain.   Practically the only other country sending us such animals is Canada, and the  importsfrom there in 1931 were only about one-thirtieth of those
1i ffrom the Free State.   Accordingly it cannot be supposedthat the Free State supply of store cattle could be taxedwithout some repercussion on prices in the United Kingdom.The Free State is also dominant among Overseas countries inthe supply of animals not for food (e.g, animals for breedingand horses) - sending us about 85 per cent, of the totalimports.  It can hardly be expected that these could be taxedwithout any effect on the prices,  wioreover, even if prices of free State goods did not rise, but their supply werediminished, the United iiingdom consumer might to some extentfind himself compelled to be content with a somewhat less desirablesubstitute, and in that way suffer because of the tariff.   4.  However, it is prooably feasible to devise a tariffwhich would fall largely, if it cannot xall mainly on the FreeState.   The following is a tentative scheme which might achieve this object:-                 Net Imports from Irish Free State.

A statement giving a short analysis of the retained     imports f con the Irish Free State is annexed.*At present on the  United xvingdom free  list.
     It is thought that in many cases these duties would fall mainly on the Irish Free State (eg. in the case of butter, or bacon), but in other cases the United Kingdommay bear most of the burden (e.gv store cattle and pork).The higher of the two rates shown above is intended to be levied on those commodities^ the duty on which is likelyto be borne mainly by the Irish Free State,   5, The above scheme still leaves about &quot;0.2 millionrequired to make up the  3 million aimed at.   The FreeState sends us about  &apos;1 million of &quot;raw materials&quot; (hidesand skins, wool, etca), and something under .32 million of&quot;manufactures&quot; (linens, woollens, clothing, books, machinery,motor cars, etc.),   A general all-round 15 per cent, dutyon the main items in these two groups might yield (say)30.2 million.   This might give the  3 million required.   6. Alternatively, a tax of (say) 10s, per standardbarrel of beer imported from the Irish Free State might atworst yield about 30.3 million, or at best about o0.5 million.Such a tax would, however, be a direct blow at Guinness.If it seriously damaged their profits there would be a loss in United Kingdom income tax*   On the other hand, if theymanaged to pass on the tax the United Kingdom consumer wouldhave to bear it.   7, There is another possible plan., namely,  a generalflat rate duty over the whole of the imports,,    The total net imports this year (1932) might b2 round  about  30million,   A 10 per cent,, duty on this trade might producesomething like 32-g- million, or possibly  2-1 million.   Alo  duty might yield up to -33a- million..
                                                     -    173   8.  There are oertain advantages in proposing a general all-round flat rate of duty, as against a selective tariff of the type set out earlier.   The latter attracts criticism directed tothe reasons for discriminating in the rate3 of duty on differentcommodities.  The flat-rate tariff avoids this objection, and indeed seems more fitted to serve as an ad hop measure designedto meet a situation or an emergency not itself of a tariffcharacter.   On the otrher hand, a selective tariff oan aim atvarying the duties according to their incidence - whether onthe Irish Pree State or on the United Kingdom consumer - and inthis way diminishing the burden falling on the latter.Whichever of these courses is adopted, it would be desirable toinclude a provision that thiB would not affect the position under the Import Duties Aot.                           Administration.   9&apos; General.  The imposition of these additional duties will inevitably complicate the Customs administration of the landfrontier between the Irish Pree State and Northern Ireland.  Forpurposes of Customs control all traffic in merchandise (with theexception mentioned in the next paragraph) between the Pree Stateand Northern Ireland is restricted to certain hours and tospecified or approved routes.   These approved routes include all the main traffic arteries between the Pree State and NorthernIreland but they are restricted in number;  do not includesubsidiary roads;  and are in many oases considerable distancesapart.  The increased volume of goods on which duty will have tobe collected may severely tax the existing machinery for collection                                                                / s                                                                 \ *on the approved routes;  greater vigilance will be required along the whole border area owing to the increased possibilities ofsmuggling;  and the patrols supplied (at United Kingdom expense) bythe Royal Ulster Constabulary for Customs duty who patrol allottedareas contiguous to the frontier will require strengthening.  10. Farm produce and live stock. A special exception to thegeneral provision as to approved routes and hours has been made(by statutory order) in favour of non-dutiable farm produce and live stock.  Such farm produce or stock carried or driven by a farmer                             -4-
(or his servant).may he &quot;brought into or out of NorthernIreland by any route or at any time.   The object ofthe concession is to obviate the hardship that wouldbe involved in requiring farmers taking their.prod.eeto markets or other parts of their farms across thefrontier, either way, to use approved routes and hours.   This concession will necessarily cease whenthe produce becomes liable to duty;  it cannot becontinued as it is essential to enable the Customsduties to be collected that the traffic should be restricted to routes and hours at which Customs Officersoan be in attendance.   This will seriously disturb theday to day transactions of farmers on both sides of thefrontier;  in many cases it will make it very difficult for them to pursue their ordinary avocations;  andin some cases it will make it impossible.   It may bepossible to mitigate these difficulties by temporaryapproval of specific roads on special occasions (e.g.on market days) but it will be impossible to providesuch facilities for all occasions and for all roads.The result will be that many Northern Irish farmerswill be greatly inconvenienced and in some casesiavolved in serious loss.     In the circumstances, it is inevitable that strong                                                      ?protest will be made to the Government of NorthernIreland whose sympathy not only the farmers but tradersgenerally,whose trade with the Free State may be prejudiced, will endeavour to elicit, and it.is forconsideration whether the Northern Irish Governmentshould not be informed of any contemplated changesbefore they become operative.   It is also essential
that the Customs administration should have adequatenotice to permit the necessary enquiry and arrange-ments to he made to meet the new situation and to give some v/arning to the farming and trading community toenable the latter to accommodate themselves to thenew conditions.     It would assist the administration if the Customscould be authorised as.early as possible to make suchconfidential enquiry as will be necessary to secureinformation on which to decide what new routes can be approved and what Departmental changes will berequired.24th June, 1932.

As  regards  duties administered &quot;by  the Beard of Inland  Revenue, the  only substantial  financial sanction that can be  used  against  the Irish Free State  in the event  of the Free State&apos;s withholding payment  of the Land Purchase  annuities- ties lies in the  cancellation of  the  double income  tax arrange ments between  the  two countries.   These  arrangements  are contained in an Agreement  dated 14th  April,  1926, which was given the force of law by  the Finance Act,  1926, (Section 23 and Second Schedule,  Part  I) and  an amending Agreement dated 25th April,  1928,  which was  given the force of law  by  the Finance Act, 192P-, (Section 21 and Fourth Schedule).  1 On the Free State side the Agreements were given the force of law by  the  corresponding  Free  State Finance Acts.     2.    Each  Agreement contains  an Article that it &quot;shall have effect  only  if and so long as legislation confirming the Agreement is in force bwth in Great Britain and Northern Ire- land and  in  the Irish Free State&quot;.    Their  operation can, therefore, be  terminated by an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament.     3..    The arrangement,-;;  embodied in the 1926 Agreement are mentioned in Article  4 pf  the Heads of  the  Ultimate Financial Settlement dated 19th March, 1926, (Cmd. 2757) which provides:- &quot;It  is  agreed between the  two Governments that the  question of double  income  tax  shall be  settled generally on the residencebasin as  elaborated in the scheme which has already been pro- visitors^nally agreed between  the Revenue Departments of the two Governments.    The two Governments agree to promote any legis- lation  necessary for  this purpose to  take effect  from thebeginning  of the financial year 1926-27&quot;.
1 Q Alog     4,   Negotiations  for  the conclusion  of a double incometax  Agreement had been proceeding  independently of the matters dealt  with  in the Ultimate Financial  Settlement.   One ofthese  matters was, however, the  claim made by the Irish FreeState  to deduct Free State income  tax from the Land PurchaseAnnuities payable tc the National  Debt  Commissioners (a claimwaived by Article 1 ef the Settlement), and it was only because the  Double Income  Tax Agreement disposed of thatclaim  - whatever its merits - that the  reference to the Agree-ment was made in the Ultimate Financial Settlement.   At mostthen the termination by the United Kingdom of the doubleincome tax Agreements  would, it  is submitted, merely revivethe  Free State&apos;a claim (a  olaim  which we  regarded as quite in-admissible anyhow) to  deduct income tax from the annuities?if payment of th.5 annuities were continued, and would not con-stitute a breach of the Settlement as a whole.   The positionis,  however, that the  Free State is threatening to withholdthe  annuities entirely; if this  threat materialises, the basisof the Settlement, so  far as concern? the double income Agree-ments7 is destroyed by the Free State&apos;s action, and the tor-mi nation of  the Agreements by the United Kingdom would seemto be a natural consequence of that action and in no sense a breach of the Settlement.     5.   If  the double income tax Agreements are terminatedlegislation  will be necessary and  it  would be natural tcassume that  this legislation will provide also that the^arrangements for double income relief in respect of theDominions generally,  which are contained in Section 27 of theFinance Act, 1920, shall not apply to the Free State,    If
lollthis is done, the resulting position will he that for doubleincome tax purposes the Free State will he treated as aforeign, country in regard to which there is no provision for relief.   In other words, the United Kingdom will not be under any legal obligation to giv? relief, either to its ownresidents or ti residents in the Free State, in respect of income that is liable to &quot;roth United. Kingdom tax and FreeState taxj   It may be assumed that the Free State willlegislate similarly to free itself from the obligation togive relief to residents in either country.     ^.   The effects on the Exchequers of the two countries can only be estimated r.n the basis of existing rates of tax and without regard to any penal taxation which theFree State may impose on United Kingdom residents.&quot;1&quot;   On this basis the financial effects of the termination of theAgreements and of the placing of the Free State outside thescope of the general Dominion relief arrangements may beestimated as follows ;-  &quot;United Kingdom Residents&quot; include not only individualsbut also United Ki.ngd.om Companies operating in the FreeState whose profits made there constitute in fact thegreater part of the income arising in the Free state to United Kingdom residents.-ii i-

The positionof the Free State Revenue authorities is, however, likelyto be very different.   A large amount of income is derivedby Free State taxpayers from the United Kingdom and thisincome has been exempted from United Kingdom tax since 1926.If it is to be charged In future to United Kingdom tax at/- in the  , the Free State authorities will probablyexperience great difficulty, at least in the first yearsof the change, in collecting their tax at the due date frompeople whose income has been decreased by one quarter.   T-hejincreased difliculties of administration in the Free state will, however, be most seriously felt in relation to doubleresidents.   Their cases which inevitably give rise tosome of the most Intricate taxation questions, have since1926 been dealt with in the Conjoint Office, an Officeestablished in London and staffed mainly by UnitedSo far as the United Kingdom Revenue authorities
Kingdom Revenue Officials.   It is not unfair to say thatA&apos;-&apos;&apos;the wealthier double residents generally have shown amarked disinclination to deal direct with the Free StateRevenue authorities and &apos; that it is mainly through the hard and good will of the United Kingdom officials in the ConjoinOffice that the Free State has obtained its tax.   Thegreater part of the tax has,in fact, reached the Free StateExchequer by transfer from the United Kingdom Revenueinstead of by direct collection, under arrangements madein connection with the 1926 Agreement.   The terminationof that Agreement will mean that the Conjoint Office willbe disbanded and that the Free State Revenue authorities will have to deal direct with this class of taxpayer.   Theresults are not likely to be satisfactory to the Free State.80         This note makes no attempt to consider what sort of penal taxation the Free State might attempt toimpose on United Kingdom  residents or what would be theresults of it on the Exchequers and on taxpayers,   the essence of the present position is the unreasonable conductof Mr. de Valera,   It is quite out of the question toprophesy  what further unreason he is capable of producing.
                  A P P E N D I X,  III             Note prepared by the Treasury.          Apart from tariffs the  scope for retaliatory actionagainst  the Pree State is very limited.   7/e cannot make good the  sums due to us by withholding payments due to thePree State Government since the only such payments are smalland relate to agency services performed on our behalf byPree State Departments.        Attention may be drawn to the following questions on which  we have entered into agreements of a financialnature with the Irish Pree State.1.      V/e have guaranteed interest and principal on theLand Bonds issued by the Irish Free State  under their post- 192 3 Land Purchase Schemes,   The original undertaking inprinciple to guarantee such Bonds v-as part of the financial agreement of February 1923 and as a result of conferencesbetween Ministers of the two Treasuries, as to the amount ofBonds and the period of their issue y/hich would be necessaryin order  to complete the new purchase scheme, our finance act of 1924 authorised the guarantee of not more than 30,000,000 of Bonds issued not later than 18th December 1932.So far Bends for about  25,000,000 have been issued underthe guarantee and the only question is whether we should re-voke our  undertaking to guarantee the balance of  .5,000,000(to cover a technical point legislation might be necessaryfor this  purpose).   It is anomalous that we should continueto confer this financial benefit  on the Irish Free State,if they default, but although the limits of eur guaranteewere settled in oral discussions  only v/e are committed to guarantee any bonds issued up to  the limits of the finance act of 1924 and cannot now withdraw further guarantees with-out breaking our promises.   Y,re also have to consider theeffect of any/                         !(i)
 revocation of our guarantee of future issues on the landlords, who  are  forced to accept the Bonds and are the primary beneficiaries of our guarantee.          It is   possible that the Free State Government might deliberately  default on their Bonds with a view to throwing on us  the burden of implementing our guarantee,  if we now refuse further guarantees it might conceivably provoke the Free State to default in this way, unlikely though such a default seems otherwise. 2.              In 1929 - as a result of discussions between Ministers and a formula initialled by both sides -  we undertook to repatriate United Kingdom silver coin from the Irish Free State and to pay face value for such silver amounting t-i  60,000 a year until 1939.   The bullion  value of such annual  payments is only  20,000, so that we lose  40,000 a year  on the transactism   The annual instalments of silver are accepted in April each year and as the 1932 silver has already  been  paid for effeetive- action could not be taken until  next year.   In any case the arrangement does not provide for its termination before it is completed. If however we were  to decide to accept no more silver from the Irish Free State, it would be necessary to prohibit the import of United Kingdom silver coin into the United Kingdom in order to prevent its transfer from the Free State into northern Ireland and its accumulation there;  and it nulg&amp;t be difficult to make this prohibition effective.3.              It should also be mentioned that in 1929 it was agreed in correspondence between Ministers to submit to arbitration (by Sir Henry Strakosch) the question sf the apportionment of the assets of the Road Fund between this
country and the Irish Free State as at the date of the separation of the two countries.   The preparation ofthe claims and counter-claims has proceeded veryslowly and the matter is not yet completely ready for submission to the arbitrator, although such completionwould not taKe very long.   We paid a sum of  200,000to the Irish Free State on account in November 19S7 andaccording to our claim a further sum of about  50,000may be due to the Free State.   On the other hand theFree State, on what we regard as quite -  untenablearguments, claim payment of a further sum of nearly 2 million.   Apportionment of the Fund is obligatoryunder the Provisional Government (Transfer of Functions)Order 1922, which in turn derives from the Treaty (Article17), but no time lim.it or method of settlement is laid down.          In present circumstances it would seem desira-ble to delay further progress with the arbitrationarrangements on the F:oad Fund and we are still in aposition to hold up the matter indefinitely.(  Note regarding the Double Income Tax arrangements.  to be furnished by Inland Revenue Departmenc)
RET                                                 APPENDIX IV.                    Effj-EOTS OF POSSIBLE FEgnLIATORY ACTION ON                      Note prepared in the Board of Trade.                General  Trade Situation.   There are three out-           standing features in our export trade to th?  Irish Free           State,    It is (a) considerable in itself,  (b) far less           affected than that of other countries by the  world           economic depression, and (c) conducted under  comparatively           favourable and free conditions.   In 1929  exports from the           united  Kingdom of produce and manufacturers to the Irish           Free State amounted in value to  36,000,000,,  a figure  which           was exceeded  by the exports to India, Australia,  the United           States  of America and Germany.  In 1931 they  amounted  to           over  30,000,000 and exceeded exports to any  other country           with the sole exception of India (exports  to  which had,           however, dropped from  78,000,000 in 1929  to   32,000,000 in           1931.  Moreover, we enjoy a favourable visible balance in           our trade with the Irish Free State, the value of the  imports           from that country having been  45,000,000  in  1929 and            36,000,000 in 1931 as against total exports  to Ireland           (including re-exports) of  46,000,000 in 1929 and  39,000,000           In 1931.   The figures of  imports and exports (including.           re-exports) for the first three months of  1932 were            7 , 400 , 000and  8 , 800,000 respectively.                The latest detailed statistics of the  trade of           the Irish ^reo State aru those for 1930.   They show that
80A of the imports into that country were derivedfrom the United kingdom, the total declared value ofthe imports from the United Kingdom for that year being 45,500,000, (a figure wnich of course Includes goods offoreign and Empire origin re-exported from thiscountry) out of a total import trade of  57,000,000.Making allowance for goods re-exported, tne imports of UnitedKingdom goods amounted in value to about  35,000,000 orapproximately 62A- of the total imports.   Goodsre-exported from the United Kingdom accounted for about another 18/c of the imports into the Irish Free State.                          -     Free State Tariff on United Kingdom goods.  Until thisyear the Irish Customs tariff covered a comparatively small number of commodities and 75/i of the import tradewas free of duty.   When the Free State was created it took over the United Kingdom Customs Tariff, which itsubsequently modified from time to time.   At one time,whilst Imperial Preference was accorded in regard to theoriginal duties, it was generally witheld when new duties were imposed.   Recently, however, it has beenusual to accord a preference, and, in  the case of the50 odd new duties imposed this year, in practically everyinstance the margin of preference for United Kingdom goodshas been one third of the rate of duty on foreign goods.Moreover, new preferences to a similar extent have been created In 14 of the 21 items on which existing dutieshave been increased since December last, on 3 items, theexisting margins have been Increased to one third, of theforeign rate.
     The new and increased duties imposed during the last fewmonths will undoubtedly bear heavily on certain classes of UnitedKingdom goods.  For example, the following classes of goods whichwere formerly free of duty are now subject to the preferential rates indicated below (the value of the goods consigned from theUnited Kingdom in 1930 being shown in brackets in thousands of  ).     Certain Wool or Worsted Woven      Tissues................................. 20% ad val.

(211)     Bicycles, Tricycles, etc................. 25% ad val.  (286)     On the other hand, it has to be recognised that the new duties cover only a limited part of the import trade.  It has,been estimated roughly that the new duties will affect some  6,000,000worth of United Kingdom trade including re-exports on 1930 figures(the total imports from the United Kingdom in that year being 45,500,000) and that some 55 to 60 per cent, of the imports fromthe United Kingdom are still free of duty, e. g. grain and flour(exports from the United Kingdom in 1930,  2,750,000), coal( 2,450,000) and cotton piece goods ( 952,000).*     The new duties on United Kingdom trade may be summarised asfollows: -         New Preferential Rates of            Value of Trade in           duty imposed&quot; in&quot;*19 52.              &quot;     19^0.

Even where the
new or  increased  duties  are  high,  it  seems very unlikely  thatthe Irish Free State will he ahle  to  satisfy all her needs by internal production, in  the  near future  at any rate.   Thenew margins  of preference should go a long way to ensure  thatsuch imports as continue will be derived almost entirely  fromthe United Kingdom.     Fossible methods  of Retaliation..,   There is no doubt thatthere is ample scope for measures  which  could do considerableharm to the  trade  of this country.    The possibilities are     (a) the withdrawal  of existing preferences.   This wouldmean, for example, on  the basis of existing duties that motorchassis would become liable  to a duty of 33^fo ad valoreminstead of 222/9$&amp;  ad valorem; men&apos;s  and women?s boots andshoes      ad valorem  instead of 25%  ad  valorem;  clothing andwearing apparel to 22-g?j  ad valorem or 60^ ad valorem accordingto class instead  of 15%  and  40% ad valorem.     (b) Imposition of discriminatory duties on United kingdom goods.   This might have very serious effects.   According toths United Kingdom Trade Returns the  value of the exports ofwholly or mainly manufactured (Class  III) goods from theUnited Kingdom to  the  Irish  Free State in both 1929 and 1930was in the region  of 320,000,000,   Some reduction will irpdoubt result from  the  recent increases of duty.   In addition,there are the two  large  duty-free  items,  coal and grain andfliur.   In  1930  coal  exports from the United Kingdom to  theFree State was valued  at ,32,450,000 and  grain and flourexports at  2,750,000.   Thus of our  total exports of grainand flour (United  Kingdom produce), valued at  4,250,000  in1930,  2,750,000 worth went  to the  Irish Free State.   an analysis of  the exports  of United.  Kingdom produce and manufactures to the Irish Free State  is  appended.   Most,  ifnot all, of  these  goods  would be available in Continentalmarkets.
     (c) A special tax on re-exports from the  United  Kingdom.For some years past the re-export trade to the Irish  FreeState has been worth some 310,000,000 per annum.    A  specialtax on this trade j.n the Irish Free State would tend  toencourage direct shipment from the Continent and also benefit the Continental entrepot trade.
