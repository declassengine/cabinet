THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT*  Secret,                                                    t                                                     Copy No.J  CP.250 (32)                                CABINET.          Trawling in the Moray Firth and the Firth of Clyde.          Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.        The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has circulated   a memorandum (CP.237 (32)) asking Ministers to reconsider   the question of trawling in the Moray Firth and the Firth  of   Clyde.  The draft Note of the Netherlands&apos; Minister, which is   appended to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum, is, in my  view,   open to grave objection, not on fishery and naval grounds  only,   but also on general  shipping grounds.        If we claim jurisdiction, as in effect we should, over these   wide areas of open sea, we shall have abandoned our traditional   policy of confining jurisdiction over coastal waters within the  ( -   narrowest limits, and we shall be seriously embarrassed in   resisting claims of all kinds to interfere with shipping outside   the three mile limit.   It is inconceivable that such a demand   on our part would not provoke corresponding claims from    ,   interested foreign nations, and having once broached the question   ourselves, we should have no answer to demands for reciprocal   treatment from our foreign competitors.   I understand that this   result would be most prejudicial to our naval and fishery   interests:  it would, in my view, be hardly less prejudicial to   our Mercantile Marine.        As an example of the possible effect in the Mercantile Marine   I would recall to the recollection of my colleagues that it was   largely because of our consistent opposition to any form of   jurisdiction beyond three miles from the coast that in order to
obtain this right for the purpose of dealing with suspectedliquor smugglers, the United States Government found itnecessary to conclude a Convention with us, which, in returnfor this concession, gave British ships the right, notwithstanding!the prohibition lav/, of carrying liquor under seal into UnitedStates ports and territorial waters.   This privilege has been of great value to our ships in competition with the heavily subsided lines of the United States.     If we now abandon our traditional policy, I am afraid thatwe shall be less able to protect our ships from foreigninterference, and in view of the magnitude of our maritimeinterests, such a result would be unfortunate.     Much more is at stake than the interests of the localfishermen, and I must press my Colleagues to ensure that they shall be subordinated to the wide national and imperial interests to which I have referred.V.R.Board of Trade,     11th July.  1952.
