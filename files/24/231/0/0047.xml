r* ^298       THE CONTROL TO BE EXERCISED OVER THE  EXECUTION  OP       THE DISARMAMENT CONVENTION BY THE PROPOSED PERMANENT                    DISARMAMENT COMMISSION,.                TJnTTr. P,Y THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION.     In the course of the conversations between the British,French and American Delegations, the subject of the control to be exercised over the execution of the disarmament convention by the proposed Permanent Disarmament commission was discussed.     The  question which had formed the  subject of constantdiscussion was considered - what powers, if any, should beentrusted to  the Commission to  carry out local inspectionsto prevent violations of the  Covenant.   The french delegation, which had pressed that  there should  be  adequatepowers,  explained that they did not  suggest that thereshould be anything in the nature of  general or routineinspection, but  they urged  that where  a specific allegationhad been made by one state  that some provision of  theConvention was being violated by another  state,  theCommission should,  if it thought necessary  in the particular circumstances pf the case,  have the  right to make  inspection.In order to conciliate the  opposition  which has  beenmanifested to proposals of  this nature, they added  that thisshould only be done when two-thirds  of the members  of theCommission, excluding the parties directly  concerned, hadresolved that the examination of documentary evidence oughtto be  supplemented by local inspection,,     At  the request of the  other Delegations they prepared a draft  of the.amendment which they thought desirable inArticle  52 of the draft Covenant,  end  this  is appended tothis memorandum.     They urged that unless there was  some such power, the  faith which countries  could place in  the                                          ^  observance/
                                                        (C S 9observance of the Convention would, be limited and the moral value of the whole work of the Conference wouldbe greatly diminished. &apos;  No doubt,, any country which waswrongly charged with infraction of the Covenant would bevery ready to accept local inspection voluntarily, but  any country which showed a bad faith and which was secretlypreparing methods of warfare that were prohibited by theCovenant could never be brought to book,  if there was nodocumentary proof and if its denial was to be accepted  asconclusive.          Although it might be conceivable that frivolouscomplaints might be made, or even complaints that were substantially unfounded, the real object  being to obtain information on other matters through a local jenquiry, they suggested that this possibility was very unlikely to berealised,   The Commissions of the League of Nations are more inclined to be over-cautious than over-active:  inany case, any disadvantage of this kind was far outweighed by the supreme importance of enabling countries to feelassured that their neighbours who had signed the Covenantwere really observing it.          We feel that there is great force in these con-contentions and suggest that the subject should receive freshand favourable consideration.   If it is  felt that thepower of requiring a Government to permit an internationalinvestigation, within its own territory,  of alleged breaches of the Covenant, is too large a power to  be entrusted tothe Permanent Disarmament Commission, there is a possiblemodification which might perhaps prove generally acceptable.This is that, in the circumstances that are envisaged,  theDisarmament Commission might report that  a certain allegation
)SCOhad been made,  that  it  was  of  a nature which warrantedenquiry, that the enquiry would not  in this case headequate without local  inspection  and that it referred the matter to the consideration of the Council of theLeague of Nations,  together with the representative ofsignatory powers not members of the  League:  if that body confirmed the necessity of inspection, then thestate concerned should  be required to give the necessary facilities.          &quot;We submit  these alternative proposals for theconsideration of our colleagues as the matter is likelyto be discussed in the  near future at the Geneva Conference.Geneva, 1st July, 1932.
                    Article 52.     Inserer entre les 2eme*et 3eme alineas un nouvel alin^aainsi congu:     Pour 11 etablissemerit cle son rapport, la Commission decidea la majorite des deux tiers a 1&apos;exclusion des parties audifferend, si 1&apos;instruction de la plainte doit etre conduite,d&apos;apres le seul examen de documents officials qui lui auront6t.4 communiques ou si la nature des faits allegues ne*cessiteune enquete sur place.     Dans ce cas  les K.P.C. s1engagent a accorder aux enqueteursqui auraient a operer sur leur territoire toutes facilitds pour11accomlissement  de leur mission.
