In its present form it may beregarded as satisfying the points urged upon me by the Viceroy,The draft also goes a considerable way - as far as I thinkpossible - towards meeting the views of certain members ofthe Liberal Party in India who have, by some means or other,become aware of our intentions and have pretested against them.To some extent their protest seems to have been based upon a misunderstanding of oar intentions which lies boon cleared upin the draft.  An earlier version of the draft was sent to thePrime Minister at Lausanne ana I expect to receive his views before the meeting of the Cabinet to-morrow.            - jmy colleagues may approve, in my speech in the India OfficeEstimates Debate in the House of Commons on Monday, the 27thJune.The draft is based upon the lines approved by theI propose to include the Statement,  in such form asS.H.23&apos;rd June 1932.

84Since the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  as announced to the Round Table Conference,  was endorsed byParliament, the primary concern of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas been so to lay their plans as to facilitate  its translationinto legislative results with the utmost possible despatch.The first immediate steps required to supplement the discussions of the Conference were the enquiries of the three committees which have lately returned from India.  The reports of two ofthese Committees are now in the hands of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and, as they hope shortly to receive  that of thethird, they are in a position to indicate the methods by whichthey intend to make further progress.definitely decided to endeavour to give effect to their poliby means of a single Bill, which will provide alike for theautonomous constitutions of the Provinces and for the federationof Provinces and States. They intend, that this measure shall contain&apos; provisions enabling the provincial constitutions to beintroduced without necessarily awaiting the completion ofall the steps required for the actual inauguration of federation. Since it is an essential feature of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s&apos;policy that the Federation which it will be theobject of the Bill to construct shall be a Federation of allIndia, it follows that the units concerned must be preparedactually to federate, and that the proposals to be laid beforeparliament to this end must be complete in all essentials;   inparticular there must be reasonable assurances forthcomingat the time the Bill is introduced that the financial andother provisions for the cementing of the structure willenable Provinces, States, the Federal Government and Parliamentalike, adequately and harmoniously to fulfil their severalfunctions,and that the interests which require to be safeguardedIn the first place. His Majesty&apos;s Government haveshall
85 2.shall be assured of practical and efficient protection.  Butit is their intention so far as lies within their power to spare no effort to secure the fulfilment of these conditions,and to this end they will continue to prosecute their endeavours to find, means as speedily as possible for surmounting the obstacles -which the study of the concrete details necessarilydiscloses.         His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully consideredthe procedure by which they can on the one hand mostexpeditiously and efficiently overcome these obstacles and,on the other hand, retain the advantages of consultation and co-operation with Indian opinion which the Round table conference was designed to secure .  After carefullyconsidering the present position, they are convinced that matters have no?/ reached a stage at which the settlement ofthe urgent and important questions that still remain to bedecided, will only be delayed by formal sessions of largebodies such as the Round Table Conference or of Committeessuch as the Federal Structure Committee. They have come tothe conclusion that expeditious treatment of the outstanding questions will best be secured by the following programme which, though involving some variation  in method, will secure to the full the collaboration which has been the underlying principle of the work accomplished hitherto.         In the first place, they will take the nextimmediate step towards the removal of obstacles and willannounce the decision which they have undertaken to give on those aspects of the communal problem which now retard progress.They are now engaged in the settlement of actual terms ofthe decision and, unless unforeseen difficulties intervene,they hope they will be able to announce it some time duringthe present summer.
         Secondly, on the assumption that the communaldecision removes the obstacles which have been impedingprogress, they trust that, as soon as their decisions havebeen announced, the Consultative Committee will reassembleand will proceed continuously with its programme^oT15orTr7&quot;bringing its collective advice to bear on the numerous and important questions entrusted to it, many of which were notexamined by the Conference or its Committees in London.Subject to discussion in the Consultative Committee of matters which affect both British India and Indian States, his majesty s Government are considering the means by whichsolutions may be facilitated and expedited of those difficultieswhich confront them in connection with matters affecting the     alone.States^  His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly hope that suchprogress may result from the Consultative Committee&apos;discussions that there may be found remaining over from  its final session only a few specific problems,  for example,financial safeguards, of such a nature that  they might appropriately be the subject of informal discussions  in london with a  few individuals whose personal experience qualifiesthem to speak with authority upon them.    If this hope  isfulfilled, their  intention would be, after such.informal discussions, to pass straight to a Parliamentary stage onthe following; lines.                                   &quot;&apos; -*         His Majesty1s Government consider that the finalstage of consultation with  Indian opinion can usefully takeplace only on definite proposals.  They  therefore propose to invite  both Houses of Parliament to set  up,  before theinj:ro^d^tion^of any bill a^Jbint Select Committee to consider their definite proposals  for the revision of theCconstitution and  to give the Committee power to confer with                                               representatives
representatives of Indian opinion, and thus to enable theIndian representatives to play an effective part in what isprobably the most important stage in the shaping of theconstitutional reforms.         But it may be that the course of discussions inthe Consultative Committee may prove that matters will notbe ripe for the formulation of definite proposals for thoconsideration of a Joint Select Committee without further consultation of a more formal character.  In that event, atthe cost of delaying their programme, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill make arrangements accordingly;  but they would regard itas essential, unless the objects they have in view are tobe frustrated, that the size and personnel of the body tobe summoned for such further discussions in London shouldbe strictly determined with reference to the number and character of the subjects found to require further discussion.  ^MSffl^1&apos; . By a procedure framed on these lines, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment hope to ensure both rapid progress towards the objective in view and the continuance of the co-operationbetween British and Indian representatives on the onehand,and between the three British parties on tho othor,upon which so much of the success of the constitutional changes must inevitably depend.
