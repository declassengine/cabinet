P\.COMMITTEE OK APPEALS PROM COURTS OP SUMMARY JURISDICTIONMemorandum by the Home Secretary,     On the 9th September last I consulted the Cabinet regarding a proposal which had been made by my predecessor to set up aCommittee to consider the question of appeals from a Court of summary Jurisdiction to Quarter Sessions.   The Cabinet then decided  (Cabinet Conclusions 55(31), Conclusion 23) that itwould not be rigiit at that time to appoint a DepartmentalCommittee to consider the question, as promised by the late government, since the only recommendation the Committee could make must lead to some additional burden being thrown on public funds.     Since then, the question has been raised, again in connectionwith the Children and Young Persons Bill which is now beforeParliament.   During the Committee Stage of this Bill in theHouse of Commons, an amendment was moved designed to reduce thecost of such appeals for children and young persons   but theamendment was withdrawn on an undertaking being given by theGovernment spokesman that the Government proposed, as soon aspracticable, to appoint a Committee to go into the tihole questionof appeals from decisions of Courts of Summary Jurisdiction.     I think the time has now come when the Government mustimplement its undertaking.   What is proposed is that a Committeeshould be set up, consisting of Sir William Lyffin-Taylor  (Chair-man), Sir Ernley Blackwell, Sir John Withers, M.P.  (who sponsoredthe Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Bill of last Session), the ChiefMagistrate, and one of the leading Recorders,   Such a Committeewould be an expert body and would not require to take evidence.
It would, not be necessary for the Committee to sit more than afew times, and the inquiry would not involve the expenditure ofany appreciable sum of jmblic money.     I propose therefore to proceed with the  ppointment of thisCommittee, on the definite understanding that, until thefinancial position of the country had improved, effect would notbe given &quot;-to-any of its recommendations involving any considerable expenditure of public money.                                 II. S.                                   17.6.32.
