I circulate, as premised, a draft declaration of British  Disarmament Policy, in relation to the Hoover announcement,  which it is urgent fcr the Cabinet to consider to-marrew.   The  paper should, not be regarded as a final draft, but it represents  much collaboration during the week-end.       The Naval, Military, and Air proposals are authorised by  the representativeDefence Departments.  In order to shorten  the document the War Office contribution has been somewhat  abbreviated.       The draft is being submitted to the Prime Minister at  Lausanne, in the hype that the  observations cf himself, the  Chancellor ef the Exchequer, and the President cf the Board of  Trade may be received before the Cabinet meets.         It will cf course be necessary to consult the  Dominions  before making any declaration in public.        Assuming that a satisfactory statement can be agreed, the  arguments for putting it forward at the earliest possible moment  (by announcement in Parliament  with contemporaneous circulation  at Geneva) are as follows;       (l.)   president Hoover&apos;s  declaration has everywhere created  the impression that America has &quot;given the lead.&quot;   It is  disappointing that we have not  done this ourselves long ago.  But at any rate  let us be more  specific now.      (8.)   It is. impossible to  fence indefinitely with the  question - what  is the British  attitude to President Hoover&apos;s                      (i)
  proposals?    There  are  four questions  to  this  effect in  the  House of Commons to-morrow (Monday).   What  answer  does  the  Cabinet wish to be  given?       (3.)    It is much  easier  to make a  statement  qualifying President  Hoover&apos;s proposals  than to  put  forward independently a complete  scheme  of our own.  This is an opportunity  not to be  missed.   we  can  (a)  express our welcome cf  the new American  drive;  (b) point  out that v/e have already formulated seme  plans just as  advanced and much more  practical; (c)  meet at  last  the  reiterated demand of the Dominions and others  for  a British  lead; (d)  provide a document which,  together with  the  Hoover document, must be considered by other powers between  now and the autumn.  Further hesitation  on  cur  part  seems  to me impossible.       As against this, it may be felt that the  British  document is nrt sufficiently bold and striking to  afford *  a satisfactory counter  to President Hoover1s.    But even so,  a connected statement of our attitude must be  made at  some  time, and by making it  now we remove the  reproach  that  we  cannot make it at all.                              (Intd.)   J.  S.i ce,e, 1932.
*                                  15S1.   The Government of the United Kingdom welcome president hoover&apos;s deo.lax-ati.on/  alike  because  it  calls for a really substantial measure of actual disarmament and because it seeks to apply the  two principlesJfojL,jsi44rch the UnitedKingdom dele gat ionJia^--ee^rn^ontending from the opening ofthe ConferSnce* - the principles!of quantitative and of quali-tative limitation.   As President Hoover says &quot;reduction should be carried out  not only by broad general cuts in arma-ments but by increasing the  comparative power of defencethrough decreases in the power of the attack&quot;.     Success at Geneva depends upon general agreement, andthe American delegation has made it plain that president hoover&apos;s proposals are put forward as a contribution to an agreed general programme.   The United Kingdom Government havealready advanced wide  suggestions of their own.   These, while they differ in some important respects as to method or measure,are inspired by the same purpose, and a comparison will showthat already there is  a substantial area of common ground.     Without interrupting or anticipating detailed discussions which must take place with the other delegations represented atGeneva, it is convenient at this moment to set out in broad outline the main characteristics of the British proposals.They in their turn should be regarded,  not as a declaration ofisolated action,  but as a contribution to general agreement.
2.   First, the Government of the United Kingdomdesire to put on record their agreement \thefurther principle that the three problems ofMilitary, Naval and Air disarmament are inter-connected.International agreement cannot be attained without an adequate contribution from all three sources.Inasmuch as Britain, like the United States, findsher strongest arm in the navy, the contribution whichconcerns her most is to be found in this sphere,in which, as is well known, contributions to dis-armament on the largest scale have already beenmade in advance of the General Disarmament Conference.Nevertheless the British Government now offer a further contribution as part of a general world settlement.3.   It is now proposed to set out under the threenecessary neads the manner in which the Governmentof the United Kingdom v/ould suggest that these principles could be applied.
Naval Proposals.4.    These proposals cover all typos of vessel - capital ships,aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers and submarines.     It is essential that proposals that are intended to beadopted by general agreement should make due provision  forvarying circumstances.    Having regard to the widely -scatteredresponsibilities of the British Navy and to the conjoint interestsof the members of the British Commonwealth, it is not practicablefl^qtfffftfifl flight. ,f^^-&apos;-A-tr&quot;jrfrrrmy^w&apos;^^^rr\rr.   &quot; But  it  is perfectlypossible  and in the highest degree  desirable  to  adopt  a mode  oftreatment whi&apos;:h will secure by  other  means  the large  reductionsat which we are all aiming.   The present Treaty limits of size and gun calibre are far too high,and  the United  KingdomGovernment consider    that  a  very large reduction,  amounting  to bout one third in the case both of capital ships  and  cruisers,can be made in future  construction.5.   As regards capital ships,  the  position under  the  existingNaval Treaties is  that the maximum  size for future  constructionhas been  fixed at  35,000  tons and the gun at  16  inches.   asbetween Britain, the United States  and Japan, however, no further capital ship construction can be undertaken until  the  year 1937.The proportions of such ships as between these three Powers is inthe ratio 15 : 15  : 9.    Now, the total tonnage  of  a  category ofships can be reduced either by diminishing their  number or by  ,diminishing their  size.   The American proposal io  roduoo 15capital ships to 10, w-e^tid^leave the size of these  enormouslyexpensive vessels  untouched.   Not  only so  but runs of 16 inchcalibre would remain in any future  construction  of  capital ships.                                                  Every figure in
volved in these huge dimensions - initial cost, upkeep.^ -pe-rsonnel,-ammunition,., stores, decks, - would, he-maintained, at the highest level.  The- united..Kiing.dom&apos;;prcposalwhile  securing no lessreduction,.in total tonnage, avoids these  consequences &quot;by  (i)reducing the size of the  gun,  (2) reducing  the  size of  the  ship.     For example, if the  calibre  of  the gun is  reduced  to 12 inchesthe maximum size-^f--the--.ship-can  be  reduced from 35,000  to  25,000tons,  and an immense saving is effected under both heads, bo-thinitially and  consequentlially.6.   But the Government  of the United Kingdom are  prepared  to go beyond this.   They ar^ ready  to apply the same  principles torruisers, and  ti  reduce  their  maximum size  and gun-calibre  by international  agreement  from  the present figure of 10,000 tonsand 8  Inohos  to 7,000  tons and 6.1  inches.   It would then bepossible  to reduce  the dimensions in the case r-f capital shipsstill  further  and fix  a  maximum of  22,000 tons with 11 inch guns.This will nearly  halve the initial  cost of any future capital ship and greatly  reduce  the cost of maintenance.  Thus thewhole  scale would come down together and there would be adefinite return to  smaller dimensions.   On this basis the British proposal would effect an ultimate reduction in capital-shiptonnage alone  of  195,000 tons, wSasj^a-s the comparable figure underthe United  States proposal would/be- about 175,000.7.    As regards aircraft carriers,  the Government of the UnitedKingdom are in substantial agreement with President Hoover1 sproposals.   They propose a reduction in the size of theAircraft Carrier from 27,000   to 22,000 tons v/ith consequent reduction  in total tonnage from 135,000 to 110,000 tons.8.    Special reference must be made  tv the Submarine.  The  Britishview has been, and is, that the  submarine should be entirelyabolished.   If its abolition  can be  secured, this will at oncelead to a reduction of approximately one-third in destroyer                              4.
                                                            160:tonnage.  If international agreement to abolish submarines isfound impossible of attainment, ocean going submarines should begot rid of by limiting the size to 250 tons, and the total tonnage to the lowest figure upon which agreement can be reached.9.   Consequently, the  Government of the United Kingdom puts forward for immediate adoption by international agreement thefollowing set of proposals relating to the navies of the world:    (l) Reduce the maximum size of any future capital ship to .22,000 tons, and the maximum calibre of the guns carried to 11  inches.    (2) Reduce the maximum size of cruisers hereafter constructed  to 7,000 tens, and maximum calibre of guns to 6.1 inches.    (3) Even if international agreement on point 2 cannot be  secured, the Government -if the United Kingdom would still urge  that the maximum size of capital ships should be reduced to  25,000 tons and their guns to 12 inches as a maximum.    (4) Reduce the maxima for aircraft carriers to 22,000 tons  with 6.1 inch guns.    (5) Abolish submarines.    (&quot;&amp;) Reduce destroyer tonnage by approximately one third, this [depending on the abolition cf submarines.  ^ (6) If submarines cannot be completely abolished, fix their  maximum surface displacement at 250 tons, with a strict  limitation both of t^-tal tonnage and number of units.     The British^$jr*cposals in the naval sphere, taken together,              ^                                STwill be finand in the case ofj*fie British Navy ,to&quot;&quot;&apos; involvenet^tfotal ultimate redirection of no less^than 281,&apos;Z9&amp;&quot;tons,and an immediat^^e duct ion of abo^tf 100,000 dfons.
LAND PROPOSALS.10.  In the realm of land disarmament 4ji^Io sairtSfa*c(juryk), fjJ^ 1,1-mh     p-pppnpoo-^tti ^r^^^^r-^r^in^r^^ HisMajesty&apos;s Government appear  t-Mb-b&apos; &quot;l&quot;ii &quot;Irariireray with the  spiritwhich has inspired the latest proposals  of President Hoover.Naturally it will be necessary carefully to examine thedetails of the American proposals before expressing a  finalopinion on their  suitability to  the  situation  of each country.11.  To consider  in turn the four categories to which  theseproposals relate:-     (a)  In regard to chemical  and  bacteriological warfareHis Majesty&apos;s Government have already  joined in rejecting the use of these  methods of  warfare  and  therefore cordiallywelcome the United States proposals  under  this head.     (b)  In regard to land  guns, His  Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave proposed the abolition  of all mobile  guns of a calibregreater than 155  mm.  (6.1 inches calibre).   Considerablestress was laid in the discussion at Geneva, on thedifficulties due  to the problem  of drawing any clear  lineof demarcation between fixed and mobile  artillery.    HisMajesty&apos;s Government  believe, however,  that  the difficulty is theoretical rather than practical.    Under  this headalso His Majesty&apos;s Government find themselves, therefore,  infvj,,LlL.accord: wi t,h  the  proposals of the  United StatesGovernment.-6-
                                                    -   162     (c)  In regard to  the  strength of land armies,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government have consistently placed  in the forefront of their proposals for land disarmament the examination of measures for the reduction of effectivesto the lowest level compatible with national safety.&quot;i^th^i vt-wr i 11 Tig - fi ? r i ag, veemen t &quot;t-^-&quot;bQ-;r-^a-&quot;h ^--^m^h^^r^^1^His Majesty&apos;s Government have already reduced  tke4**-4awnffor-oo-G to the minimum numbers required for the preservation of internal order and for the defence of their overseas possesions and communications.     The United States  proposal for a division of land forces into a &quot;police component&quot; and a &quot;defence&apos;component&quot; raises points of some difficulty and willrequire very careful examination;  but so far  as HisMajesty&apos;s Government understand tne)suggested  basisof calculation, tho -rersul&apos;t&quot;,i,wi^^b^r^oi&apos;a&apos;sh&apos;Q^fr that theBritish land forces have already been reduced  substantially below the number recognised to be necessary for themaintenance of internal order, without making  any allowance for the forces needed for the protection of lines of communication  between the United Kingdom and the overseas territories.     (d)  In regard to  tanks, His Majesty&apos;s Government havealready advocated the abolition of all tanks above aweight of 20 tons, which by their characteristics are  ;specially suitable for  offensive employment in battle.In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government to  advocate the abolition of all tanks would not contribute in the longrun to the cause of disarmament.
Tanks of the  lighter  type  cannot be regarded as specificallyoffensive weapons.   Their comparatively light armour andtheir reduced capacity for crossing trenches render themunsuitable for the assault Kf highly organised defences.     But as a means of saving the life of the soldiers, aswell as of economisimg man power ,tanks are invaluable.   Ina small voluntarily enlisted army like our own they constitute an  essential compensation for lack of numbers whichit would be impossible to surrender.    As far as this countryis concerned,  in view of its world-wide responsibilities, anygeneral prohibition would require an increase in cur presentland forces in terms  of man power,  and thus, as a measure of disarmament would tend to defeat its own ends.12.   It will be seen therefore that in the realm of landdisarmament the proposals of the United States Government, sofar as they relate to matters which directly touch the land forces of the  United Kingdom and of the countries of the BritishCommonwealth, approximate very closely to those gu3Sdeiid^-^tti4i^w-and by  His Majesty&apos;s Government; and that in the total oftheir effectives His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able alreadyto put into practice a measure of disarmament which g&amp;j&amp;&amp;**&amp;^&amp;ric.the standards proposed by President Hoover.8
Air Proposals,13,     There is no aspect of international  disarmament morevitally urgent  than the adoption without  delay of the  most effective measures to preserve the civilian  population fromthe fearful horrors of bombardment from the  air.    The Govern-ment of the United Kingdom would be prepared to go to  any length, in agreement with other Powers, to achieve this object,and if more drastic measures are proposed from any other quarterand are shown to be practicable, they will examine them with theutmost sympathy.        They propose that the High Contracting Parties should agree between themselves in respect of their air forces thatthere should be        (l)   the complete prohibition of all bombing  from the              air save within limits to be laid down by an              international convention.   Attacks upon the civilian              population would be prohibited.   The convention  would              define as precisely as possible the limits of              permissible military objectives; .        (2)   a strict limitation in the  unladen weight of all             military and naval aircraft (  troop carriers and  flying             boats excepted);     3   (3)   a restriction in the numbers of all kinds of military anfcl             naval aircraft.quoting figures^/                                -9-
14.     One of the most notable of the reductions proposedby President Hoover is the diminution by one-third in thenumber of effectives forming part of what  is termed theDefence Component of Armies, as distinct from the Police           ^Component;  together with a limitation of the PoliceComponent in accordance with a fixed standard.   We earnestlytrust that the countries concerned will accept this proposal.The United Kingdom Government, having abolished conscription  t  \rafter the War, possesses no Defence Component at all as defined in the Presidents proposals, while, as previouslystated, its Police Component is already considerably belowthe standard of strength that his plan would authorise.l*i    It is        essential to bear in mind the extentof British disarmament already effected, both on sea and,  by                                                              \ I A.measures additional to the abolition of conscription, on land.  \  Jpo                                                             -  \ vtUIf a comparison is made with the year before the War, it will be \   ,found that in completed sfe*^s the capital ships of the BritishCommonwealth have been reduced from 69 to 159 its cruisers from108 to 52, its destroyers from 285 to 147 and its submarines from74 to 52.   The personnel of the British Army, including itscontingents in india has been reduced in the same period from259?0QQ men to 207,000?  and this has been effected by the disband--ment of 9 regiments of caSfa rys 61 batteries and companies of artillery, 21 companies of Royal

One of the most notable of the reductions  proposedby President Hoover is the diminution by one-third in thenumber of effectives forming part of what  is  termed the                                                           &apos;1  \                                                            \  t a defence Component of Armies, as distinct from the Police           ^                                                                r.Component;  together with a limitation of the Police          .Component in accordance with a fixed standard.    V,re earnestly    m,,-trust that the countries concerned will accept this proposal.    h&apos;&apos;&quot;&quot;^The United Kingdom Government, having abolished conscriptionafter the War, possesses no Defence Component at all as defined in the Presidents proposals, while,  as previouslystated, its Police Component is already considerably belowthe standard of strength that his plan would authorise.lS-j,    It is in4e-e.d essential to bear in mind the extentof British disarmament already effected, both on sea and, by measures additional to the abolition of conscription, on lend.  \If a comparison is made with the year before the War, it will befound that in completed siw*pe the capital ships of the BritishCommonwealth have been reduced from 69 to 15, its cruisers from108 to 52, its destroyers from 285 to 147 and its submarines from74 to 52.   The personnel of the British Army, including itscontingents in India, has been reduced in the same period from25&apos;9?0QQ men to 207,000;  and this has been effected by the disband-ment of 9 regiments of cajffi&amp;ry, 61 batteries and companies of artillery, 21 companies of Royal                              ^

The air arm v/as in its infancy in 1914 and no comparison can be madev/ith that date, but it must be mentioned that in the numberof military and naval aeroplanes the United Kingdom standsonly fifth in the list of States;  and that of tyrfe aircraftauthorised for home defence in 1923 by the United KingdomGovernment, with the approval of Parliament, 20 per cent,have not in fact been constructed.lgT     Great and far-reaching as these reductions havebeen - beyond comparison greater than any which have been effected elsewhere ^)ut si de the countries disarmed by theTreaty of Versailles)- His Majesty&apos;s Government(s) in theUnited Kingdom, ^the Dominions and India-/ are ready,and indeed eager, to join in further measures for which general agreement can be attained,   The proposals whichaccordingly are now made constitute an additional contribu-tion, practical and extensive, to the effort to relieve theheavy burdens which the maintenance of existing standardsimposes upon the world, and which the world expects us, bya great common effort, effectively to diminish.This statement is only appropriate if it has been agreedthat the United Kingdom representatives should speak onbehalf of the whole British Commonwealth,  including theDominions and India.
