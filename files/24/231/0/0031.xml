uonnMSLni is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BEITANITIO MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT, RET.3C(&apos;32) .CABINET,DISARMAMENT - THE BRITISH PJtAW.Note by the First lord of the Admiralty.         I wish to bring before the Cabinet theattached suggestions by the Admiralty for amending the announcement of Naval proposals for disarmament,,B*  E.  MoADMIRALTY, S,W.l0     27th June. 193So
               DRAi3&quot;P DISARJL&amp;IMT 3 TaTKUEM .         It requires to be &quot;brought out, if a statement is tobe made, that our present proposals are qualitative ratherthan quantitative.         We should not conceal that their effect will be inthe future and not immediate.         The Washington and London Kaval Treaties representour contribution to quantitative disarmament.         The shop window effect of the Hoover proposals isof course immediate reduction.  We cannot possible attemptto compete in this respect  and it would be better that thestatement should be quite frank and say s&amp;.         Therefore, I would suggest that on page 3 there shouldbe something of the attached nature substituted for the present draft.         It Is also very desirable if we are to make a plainstatement, without attempting to conceal anything, that weshould now indicate that an increase in cruisers will benecessary in the future - hence suggested amendments pages3 and 5.
 Pago  3c    Substitute  for first  two paragraphs:-          These  proposals cover  all  types of  vessels -  capital&quot; ships, aircraft carriers,  destroyers  end submarines.          In  general they are  qualitative rather  than quentita- ti.ve,  Their effect will not  be immediate  but will be  consld- erafcle in the future.          Quantitative Naval measures  have  already been taken and find  their  expression In  the Washington  and  London Naval   at:- a&apos;-..   Tvh-ch -stand  to-day as the  only  agreed measures of disdrmament*          His Majesty1s  Government are prepared   to recommend a further quantitative  measure  of naval disarmament in the reduction in aircraft carrier tonnage to approximately the figure proposed by the United States, and  albo in the  abolition of the submarine and consequent reduction  of destroyer tonnage.          As regards the  other  two categories, however, namely capital ships and cruisers,.having regard  to the widely scattered  responsibilities of the British Navy and to  the conjoint  interests of the members of  the British CommonwealthsEis Majesty-s government  cannot reduce numbers below the limits allowed by the  Treaties -which come up for  revision in  1935, even though other powers  whose  responsibilities  are more concentrated may find it possible to  do so,          This ap?litrS with particular emphasis to cruisers and it is necessary to state  plainly  to-day that so far from a reduction in  this category  being possible an increase will actually  be necessary in  the  future to meet our  requirements,.          But whilst further quantitative naval disarmament and immediate reduction is thus limited,  it is perfectly possible and in the highest degree  desirable to frame measures  to-day in regard to  qualitative  naval  disarmament which will  eventually secure large  reductions  at which we are all aiming,  Such measures,  if  agreed, will  regulata all further construction,                                                    including /
including that of powers which are not included in the presenttreaties, and who may be contemplating construction in thenear future,         The present treaty limits of size and gun calibre are far too high and the United Kingdom Government consider that avery large, reduction amounting to about one third in the caseboth of  capital ships and cruisers can be made in futureconstruction,    V    O    O    CO     o    o    o    o    0    0Page !Oo  iPo:: i substitute         Reduce the maximum size of aircraft carriers hereafterconstructed to 22., 000 tons and maximum calibre of gun to 6,1inchesoPage 5C  per last paragraph substitute         The British proposals in the Naval sphere, taken together, and after allowing  for the increase in cruisercategory, will be found in the ease of the British Navy to involve a nett total ultimate reduction of no lass than281,700 tons and an immediate reduction of about 100,000 tons.
