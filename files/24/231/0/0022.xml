This document is the property of His Britannic- Majesty 1 s Government.SECRET .CP. 221 (52) .          CABINET.             Copy No.                 CHIELDREH AND YOUI.G PERSONS BILL .                 Memorandum &quot;by the  Home Secretary.        I  submit to the Cabinet a Memorandum by Mr.  Oliver   Stanley on the situation that lias been created by the action   of the  House of Lords in inserting an amendment into  the   Children and Young Persons Bill, dealing with, the employment   of persons between the ages of 14 and 18 in the ,;unregulated   occupations&apos;&quot;&apos; .        I  am myself inclined to the view that the best course now   is to agree to the amendment, with the modification suggested   by Mr.  Stanley.   The suspensory provision puts the matter on   a different footing from liitiierto;  it will be an answer to   opponents  of the proposal, who may complain that  they have been   out-manoeuvred, and with the acquiescence of the  Government.   They will have a full opportunity of expressing their view, and   inviting the decision of the House of Commons upon it, if and   when an authorising Resolution is brought before  Parliament.   Should  the Home Office be able,  as the outcome of inquiries now   about to be undertaken, to frame alternative proposals on-   better  lines, It could still do  so, and present its new scheme   in a Bill as intended.   That Bill would supersede the con-   ditional clause now proposed to  be added to trhe Statute Book,   and the clause could be repealed, without having been put Into   effect, at the same time that the better provision was enacted.

               CffgJgiEN  AMD  YOTJNG-  &apos;PERSQNS  BILL .                Memorandum by Mr. Oliver Stanley.     A difficulty lias arisen with regard to the Children and young Persons Bill about which it is necessary to obtain thedecision of the Cabinet,   It will be remembered that when thedraft Bill was submitted to the Cabinet it contained  provisions which empowered the Local Authorities to regulate tiie employmentof persons between the ages of 14 and IS in the so-called&quot;unregulated occupations&quot;, but it was then decided by the Cabinet (Cabinet Conclusions 5(32), Conclusion I) that these provisions should be omitted owing to their controversial nature and theirpossible effect on industry.   During the Committee Stage in theHouse of Commons, it became obvious  that there was widespreadsympathy among the supporters of the Government for a new Clause,moved by Lady Astor, which would Have bad the effect of restoringthese provisions.   So probable did  it seem that such a new clause might be carrxed in Committee that I asked the Cabinet forfurther instructions, and was authorised (Cabinet Conclusions23(32), Conclusion 2) while opposing the clause to pledge theGovernment to the introduction of a - measure dealing with thisquestion as soon as the industrial situation improved.   In con-sequence of this pledge, many supporters of the Government who                                                           A -were strongly in favour of the proposed regulation subordinatedtheir own personal sympathies to their loyalty and the clause was defeated by 29 to 9.   Vihen the matter came before the House onReport Stage, the Government pledge  was repeated and the proposed new clause was again defeated by a majority of 193 to 68, thoughmany of those who supported the Government in the division lobbywere in sympathy with the clause.     During the Committee Stage of the Bill in the House ofLords, a similar clause was moved by Lord As tor&apos;, with the
addition of the following words - 11 Provided that this section shall not come into operation until a Resolution has been passedby both Houses of Parliament.&apos;&apos;&apos;   After a brief discussion inwhich only four temporal peers took part, of whom one spokeagainst the clause and another was a member of the oppositionLord Snowden, who was in charge of the Bill for the Governmentexplained that while he was instructed to oppose the amendmenthis sympathies were perhaps over-riding his loyalty in thematter, and in view of the proviso he did not see any immediateharm in the new clause proposed.   He accordingly accepted theclause without a division.     I therefore ask for the instructions of the Cabinet as tothe course which is to be pursued when the House of commons is asked to consider the Lords&apos; amendment.   It is useless todisguise the fast that considerable feeling has been aroused.Many Members who sympathised with the provisions but in deference to my appeals supported the Government in rejecting the clause,are now asking why back-benchers in the House of Commons shouldalone be expected &amp;ot to let sympathy over-ride their loyaltyand they feel that, in consequence of my appeal to them andtheir response to it, they have been put in a . thoroughly falseposition in the eyes of their constituents.   It would in anycase be difficult to ask them to reject an amendment which theHouse of Lords thought so Innocuous in its effect upon industry that they accepted it without a division,,                i     On the other hand, if the House is now advised to accept this amendment made by the Lords, those who are opposed to these provisions but accepted the statement of the Government thatthey would not bo included in the Bill, when they see that this amendment was not carried by the Lords in the face of theGovernment Spokesman but passed with his acquiescence and encouragement, will feel deprived-of their legitimate opportunitycf criticism and amendment.
     As the clause now stands the necessary resolution can be  moved by any private Member, and in any event it should bemade clear that it should originate only from the Government.This alteration would present no difficulties from a draftingpoint of view.   Further, the Government will now be subjected to a constant pressure to introduce and to carry the resolution which would put the clause into operation.     Finally, the addition of the proviso postponing theoperation of the new provisions does not remove the objectionsto the inclusion of the new clause in the Bill.   Considerabledifference of opinion was shown during the course of the deb-atein the House of Commons as to the wisdom of the methods, quite apart from the desirability of the principle - a matter which appears to have escaped, the attention of the House of Lords.There was strong support for the view that these duties shouldnot be put on local authorities, and I promised that, in the interval before the Government considered the industrialimprovement sufficient to warrant the implementing of thispledge, I would investigate the question of devising alter-native machinery for carrying It Into effect.   Ho greaterdisservice could have been done to the supporters of theprinciple than the acceptance of a clause which stereotypesthe machinery in the form which now appears to be the leastacceptable to the House of Commons and the least likely to            a                                            *receive its approval.     In these circumstances I should be glad to have the decisionof the Cabinet whether the House of Commons is to be advised toagree or disagree with the Lords in their amencment.                                     0 VS.                                        17/6/32,                  t
