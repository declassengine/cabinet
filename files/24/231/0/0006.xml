Memorandum by  the President of the Board of Trade.            As my  colleagues may be aware, in the Spring of last year       the late Government asked the Universities in the four areas       principally affected  by  the depression in the basic industries       to undertake  industrial  surveys of their areas.            The areas  and universities concerned were:-               South West Scotland.           Glasgow University.               North-East Coast of England.   Armstrong College                                              (University of Durham).               Lancashire                    Manchester University.

Wales and                                              Monmouthshire.            The Government have helped both by supplying the       Universities  with the statistical, material in the possession of       the various Departments  and by meeting the expenses, which have       been oh a very  moderate  scale, much of the work having been       voluntary.  The reports  relating  to South-West Scotland and       South Wales are now ready for publication and the others will       follow in due course.                                                             \ ) \            The object of the inquiries  was to present a survey of the       present industrial position of the areas, and of the prospects       of early expansion and new development, and  to - ssess, so far aB       practicable,  the prospective employment capacity of the various       industries  in the areas  as a basis for an estimate of the volumeIof labour likely to &quot;be surplus to the requirements of individuali       industries  within the next few years.Ppool University have  dealt  with Merseyside and Manchester University  will cover the rest  of Lancashire.* ,v?S DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY/S GOVERNMENT.
     While the problem of surplus labour  is  a matter whichprimarily concerns the Ministry of Labour, questions affectingother Departments also arise.   Further, the  economictendencies described in the Reports are of interest to theGovernment as a whole.  The Reports,  taken together, are somewhat long, and I have,  therefore,  had the attached memorandum prepared summarising the Reports  and bringing  outthe features common to the  areas in question.                                         w.R.rd of Trade,13th June,  1932.
  MEMORANDUM        .  OKTEE  INDUSTRIAL  SURVEYS          OP THE  DEPRESSED  AREAS-         BY  H. H.  MQNTGOMERIE(Ministry of labour).
                               INTRODUCTION.   1*  It was decided by the late Government that a Survey should be made ofindustrial conditions in each of the depressed areas and that the task of conducting the Surveys should be entrusted to the Economics Departments ofthe Universities in these areas.     The Universities,, it was considered4, were already well informed as tothe industrial conditions prevailing in their areas and had facilities available to them9 to a degree greater probably than to any other authority^for ascertaining the oauses peculiar to their areas which had operated toproduce in them the severe incidence of unemployments  It was deemed a furtheradvantage that while the Universities would have at their command all the relevant information in the possession of Government Departments,, they wouldbe free to conduct their enquiries and reach their conclusions unfettered byany kind of State or Departmental direotion or interferences     Accordingly,, the functions of the various Government Departments havebeen confined.,, so far as these Surveys are concerned^ to supplying suchstatistical information as the Universities have considered necessary for thesuccessful prosecution of their enquiries.   2C  The depressed areas whose industrial conditions have been brought underreview comprise the Lancashire area (which for this purpose has been dividedinto two sub-areas, Merseyside and the rest of Lancashire), the North-east coast, South Wales and South-West Scotland.     The Universities to whom the enquiries were entrusted were respectivelythe Universities of Liverpool and Manchesterj Armstrong College, Newcastle-on-Tyne (University of Durham),&apos; University College of South Wales, Cardiff,&quot; andthe University of Glasgow.   3o  No limitation was imposed upon the Universities as to the scope of theSurveyss but it was intimated to them that their enquiries should be directed towards the production of a report whioh should include ^-    (a) a survey of the present industrial position of the areaj    (b) the prospectB of early expansion and new developments having regard       particularly to new industrial developments within recent years; and    (o) so far  as practicable,an assessment of the prospective employment       capacity of the various industries in the areas as a basis for an
       estimate of the volume of labour likely to be surplus to the       requirements of individual industries within the next few years,   4*  The reports from the Universities have now been received and are about to be published in five volumes, aggregating, it is estimated, some 1^500pages..  Summaries of these five reports have accordingly been prepared and a;available as an Appendix to the present Memorandum,in whioh an outline of tbgeneral position in all the areas is given.   5*  She picture presented by the Surveys of conditions in the depressed areas is not altogether one of unrelieved gloom.  There is9 in fact, aconsiderable degree of variety^ bright patches exist and in considerablenumber, but behind the contrasts which serve to differentiate the positionoindividual industries in the  several  areas, there runs the same dull back-ground-, reflecting the operation of those factors which have contributeduniformly not only to arrest the expansion of industry in these regions butseriously to reduce the level of their activity,and producing an effect atonce sombre and disquieting.  It is the purpose of this Memorandum to dealbroadly with those factors^ common to the several regionsa which have operate to produce these differences of light and shade.                         POPULATION AMD MIGRATION.   6*  The first common feature exhibited by the Surveys is that all the regions have suffered within the last decade a retardation in the rate of growth of their population greater than that of the country as a whole.  Sopronounced ha3 this tendency been in the case of South Wales and South WestScotland that in these areas the population actually declined by some 70^000and 2^700 persons respectively; in the County Palatine and on the North EastCoasts although there have been aotual increases of population of 106,000 an!26,000 respectivelya these accessions represent a lower rate of progress thaihas occurred in other parts of the country^  This has resulted in these twoareasa in common with Scotland and South Wales, now supporting a smaller proportion of the country&apos;s population than they did in 1921.   7o  This retardation in the rate of growth of population has been accompanied in all the areas by substantial losses due to migration. InSouth Wales alone, the loss from this oause amounted in the last 10 years                                     2
242,000 persons; the oorresponding figures for South-West Sootland andLancashire were respectively 200,000 and 132,000, while the depletion fromthis cause on Tyneside and in Durham has been estimated as 12^000 persons for the four years 1926-1929.     As regards these movements of population the position in Lancashiremerits attention^  There the loss by migration amounts to only 207 per cent.of the 1921 population^ as compared with 12*3 per cent, in South Wales and9o2 per cento in Scotland,  Hence the conclusion is inevitable that of allthe depressed areas Lancashire is the least mobile.  To some extent the heavier migration in South Wales and in Scotland is due to the efforts madeunder the Industrial Transference Soheme,  but in face of the large and continuous surplus of labour in the area,  the immobility in Lancashire isregarded by those responsible for the Survey of the region as revealing a breakdown of individual and family initiative.     The factors responsible for this immobility appear to be, firstly, the specialised nature of the work in the region which makes it impossible for thegreat bulk of the workpeople to move out quickly to other skilled work withoutpreliminary training,, secondly, the prevalence of the family income,  which hashad the effect of lessening the hardships of unemployment and of weakeningthe incentive of younger workers to seek new fields of employment, and,thirdlyf short-time working and underemployment which have operated so as to conceal the true extent of the labour surplus in the region, and thus to minimise the magnitude of the labour problem with which the region isconfronted.                        TTHEMPLQIMBNT IN THE DEPRESSED .6REAS*   8.,  A second feature common to all the Surveys is that for all the areas,as for the country as a whole, the year 1929 was, by common experience, not far removed, if at all, from a normal post-war year and that the industrial position disclosed in the two succeeding years was wholly exceptional andabnormal and reflected a depression not merely of looal but of world-widesignificance.     The unemployment problem in the depressed areas has, therefore,  to beconsidered as consisting, in general^ of two distinct elements, the first of                                   3
which represents the normal post-war unemployment which has settled upon these areas to a greater degree than elsewhere, while the second refleots the weight of international depression, which, though exercising an influence onall areas, has also fallen upon the depressed areas with special severity.Accordingly, the unemployment figures for 1929 may be regarded as affording,broadly speaking,, an approximate indication of the influence exercised by thefirst of these elements on the industrial situation while the figures for1930&quot;51 give quantitative expression to the combined effect of both.   9*  The magnitude of the unemployment problem in the several areas and thepart played in creating it by the two sets of forces referred to above may begauged by a reference to the Table below.  Prom these figures emerge twoinevitable conclusions.  In the first place unemployment is moving in thedepressed areas on a definitely higher plane than in the country as a wholeeven in normal post-war years, and in the second, the depressed areas,alreadysuffering from an excessive burden of unemployment, have been affectedadversely to an even greater extent than other parts of the country by thedepression of 1930-31*		Insured		Unemployed Insured Persons					Area	Popula-tion	Totals			Percentages				1930.	1929	1930	1931	1929	1930	19311.

                       EMPLOYMENT IN THE DEPRESSED AREAS.  10o  Devastating though these figures of unemployment, when viewed by themselves, appear to be, indicating that in the depressed areas about oneinsured worker in every three in 1951 was unemployed, they are apt to create a false impression unless they are considered in conjunction with the employ-ment which the depressed areas have been able to afford within recent years,  11*  The 1929 position&apos;-  An analysis of the employment  capacity of thevarious regions is more reassuring, for it shows that in all the regions, withthe exception of South Wales, employment capacity between  1925 and 1929,though subject to inevitable fluctuation,remained remarkably stable and on  thewhole tended to increase.  Despite the accessions to the ranks of theunemployed during that interval, the North East Coast, South West Scotlandand Lancashire afforded employment to about 19,000, 47,000 and 101,000 morepersons in 1929 than in 1925* representing an advance in employment capacity in that period of 5*2, 8.2 and 806 per cent, respectively.  In South Wales,however, employment capacity declined by some 88,000 persons or 19 per cent.     Thus with the exception of South Wales, the employment position in allthe depressed areas, though failing to maintain its former rate of progress,was  up to 1929* relatively not unfavourable^ the demand for labour was onthe whole increasing and any cause for disquietude that then existed was  due  -to the failure of the increase to reach such proportions as would afford fulltime employment to the expanding ranks of the insured population.  12.  The position in 1950-511-  The events of 1950 and 1951 created a problem of a different order.  In these areas unemployment became really acuteand employment capacity suffered a recession amounting almost to a landslide.     On the North-East Coast employment capacity declined  between 1929 and1951 by 20 per cent, representing some 120,000 persons,&quot; in Lancashire,despitea slight recovery which took place in the last three months of 1951* i*declined by about 200,000 persons^ and in South Wales by over 60,000 persons,while in South-West Scotland 55sOOO fewer persons were employed in 1950 thanin  the previous years
                  THE DECLINE OF THE STAPLE OR BASIC INDUSTRIES.   13.  A third feature, on which all the Surveys register agreement, is thatthe main reason for the present plight of the depressed areas arises from the concentration in them of certain staple or basic industries, all of whichhave been suffering over a prolonged period a continuous decline in prosperit     It is the peculiar degree of dependence of the areas on these industriesthat accounts for the severe inoidence of unemployment.  In Lancashire 56 percenta of the insured population find their livelihood in cotton, coal andengineerings  more than half of the activity of Merseyside is concerned withshipping, transport and distribution; on the North^East Coast nearly two-thirds of the insured population is engaged in the heavy basic industries -coal, iron and steelj engineering, shipbuilding, chemicals and shipping!  inSouth Wales coal, iron and steel, and tinplate account for four-fifths of thepersons employed in productive industry^  while South-West Scotland, though perhaps more highly diversified industrially than some of the other depressed areas, is mainly dependent upon shipbuilding, iron and steel, engineeringscoal apd textiles.   14.  In view of the high degree of absorption of the industrial populationby these industries;, it is clear that their fortunes are bound to haveimmediate and influential repercussions on the prosperity of the area as awhole.  The examination, over a periods of conditions in the staple industriesreveals, however, certain disquieting features.     Despite the new uses that have arisen for coal and an increasing world demand, the amount produced in this country shows, as compared with pre-war years, a substantial contraction.  Annual output dropped between 1913 and1930 from 57m0 tons to 46m. tons in South Wales and from 42o5m. tons to31*7m. tons in Scotland!  in Lancashire the average annual output fell from23.2m0 tons in the period 1911-1915 to 15* 7m. tons in 1927-1930J  on theNorth East Coast it fell from 54m. tons in I909-I913 to 48nu tons in 1925-1930and in Great Britain as a whole from 287m. tons in I913 to 243.8m.tons in 193&quot;     Similarly,, in shipbuilding, tonnage launched on the Clyde declined from757*000 tons in 1913 to 530,000 tons in 1930, a decline which has itscounterpart on the North-East Coast where the average annual tonnage launchedfell from 771,000 tons in 1909-1913 to 623,000 tons in 1927-1930.
     The annual production of pig iron fell between I913  and 1929 by morethan one half, from 1.4m. tons to .6m. tons, in Scotland  and from 3,9m,, tonsin 1913 to 2.1m. tons in 1925-30 on the North-East Coast; and  in so short aperiod as 1924-30, the total production of cotton yarns in the United Kingdomdeclined from 1,350m. lbs0 to 920m. lbs.,  Indeed, so far  as  the  basic-industries are concerned, the only encouragement to be derived comes from thegeneral engineering and metal manufacturing industries which showed up to1929 at leastj, a remarkable resilience in face of depressing conditions which even enabled them, when considered as a whole and apart from the fortunes of individual branches, to advance slightly,, though they have both  of coursesuffered from the unprecedented depression of 1930 and 1931*   15*  One important element in all these industries, which has tended toincrease their vulnerability and to make them peculiarly  susceptible to acontraction of the order described in the preceding paragraph, is theimportance to them of their export trade, insofar as it renders  them open tothe play of world wide forces over which they can exercise little or no control.  Exports of coal and foreign bunkers account for about  60 per cent.of the total output of South Wales, and 40 per cent, of that of  the NorthEast Ooast and these have declined respectively by 6jbiu tons and 3^* tons annually as compared with pre-war years.  Exports of cotton  manufacturesamounted, up to 1930 at least, to 70 per cent, of the total  production anddeclined, between 1924 and 1930 by 32 per cent, (on value adjusted for price)eA similar contraction took place in textile engineering whose  exports droppedbetween 1913 and 1930 from 178,000 to 91,000 tons.  Again South-West Scotlancexported 137,000 tons of pig iron in 1910 as compared with 30,000 tons in1930 while exports of iron and steel products from the North-East Coastdeclined from 669,000 to 367,000 tons between 1924-30*   16*  The dependence of these staple  industries upon their export marketsis thus clearly established.  It ia for this reason that  the depressed areas have  suffered more  severely than other parts of the country from the worlddepression of 1930-31, for that depression has hit the export trade  severely,accentuating the drop in exports and  still further depressing these  sorelyburdened  industries.      Consequently  on the North-East Coast, a loss of 8 per cent., in theemployment capacity of the basic industries which occurred in 1924-29 was
translated into a loss of 42 per cent, by 19J1J  in coal and iron and steel,losses of 19*5 and 4 per cent, -were turned into losses of 44*5 &amp;nd 41 per cerespectively.  Shipbuilding, which employed 2 per cent, more in I929 than it1924, was more severely affected than any other industry in the area by theconditions of the next two years, so that in 1951 It found employment for &amp;per cent, fewer persons than in 1924.     In Lancashire the numbers unemployed increased between 1929 and the thiquarter of 1951 more than threefold in cotton, electrical engineering, andshirts and underclothing, and more than doubled in distribution, general engineering, textile finishing, tailorings printing, chemicals and rubber;the increase in unemployment in the cotton industry was of particular sever!!for although there was some slight recovery in the earlier part of 1951* inthe third quarter of that year there were seven persons unemployed for every two who had been unemployed in 1929*     In Scotland, the unemployment percentages increased to. 52e8  in shipbuilding, 31*6 in mining and 27.5  in metal manufactures in 1950 and the:percentages were considerably added to in the following year.  In South Walethe percentages in 1951 rose to 55*4 in coal mining,  54.7  in  iron and  steelmelting and 42.6 in tinplate and on Merseyside to  50  per cento in shippingits associated industries.         THE EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIES OTHER THAN THE STAPLE INDUSTRIES.   17*  The industrial position in all the depressed  areas would  have  been much more serious had not the conditions created by the decline of the staplindustries been to some extent mitigated,on the one hand,  by the  expansionof already existing industries and, on the other   by  the growth of new industries.  This development has, indeed, served  to  give  to  industry  in thedepressed areas a new orientation, making the areas less dependent on  those industries on which their prosperity in the past has  been  built up andattaching a new importance to those more recently  introduced.   18.  In this respect the experience of the North-*East Coast Is typical.In that region the insured population  attached to  the basic industries fellbetween 1924 and 1951 by  10 per cent*  while that of other  industries increasby 51 per cent, and a loss in the employment afforded by the  former group of42 per oent. was to some  extent offset by an  increase of 15 per cent,  in *h8latter.                                   8
     Similarly in South-West Scotland many industries other than the  stapleindustries have advanced their employment capacity within recent years.   Thoseproviding the most substantial percentage advance between 1924 and  1930 weremiscellaneous manufacturing industries (25.8),distribution (21),building  andpublic works construction (12,6) and printing and paper (11.9). In  Lancashire,the distribution services and the electrical industries showed an increase inemployment which was large and continuous between 1923-1930, although somedecline took place in 1931*  There was an almost three-fold increase  in theemployment capacity of tram and &apos;bus transport between 1923 and 1931, an  increasefar in excess of that in the country as a whole.  The clothing industries showedmarked development and very substantial increases also occurred in  a  number of smaller industries in the region, such as artificial silk,artificial  stone,glassbottle manufacture,hosiery,laundries, bricks and tiles,constructional engineeringprinting and publishing, furniture and wallpaper.     On Merseyside, substantial percentage increases in employment  occurred inwholesale and retail distribution (50),building and associated industries (31),electrical industries (52),furniture (25),with smaller advances in  miscellaneousmetals, milling, artificial silk and printing. Owing to the scarcity  ofsubsidiary industries in South Wales, the opportunities for a similar expansion in that region have necessarily been restricted, but nevertheless there was amost pronounced increase in the numbers attached to and employed in the distributive trades of the region.   19. This leads naturally to the most striking feature of the expansion/  itis one which is common to all the areas and consists in the remarkabledevelopment which has occured within recent years in the services attached towholesale and retail distribution.  In these trades the insured populationincreased during the last seven or eight years by about one-third  in  South-WestScotland, the North-East Coast and Lancashire and by no less than one-half  onMerseyside and in South Wales.   20.  The reasons for this remarkable drifb into the distributive trades andfor the apparent paradox of increasing employment in them at a time of severegeneral depression are not altogether clear.  Some part of it is undoubtedlydue to the depression of the staple industries, to the consequent attractionwhich the distributive trades have offered to many workers unable to  find employment in their ordinary avocations and to the pressure which has beenbrought to bear on new entrants into the industrial field to look for outletsin other than the hitherto accepted directions.     Some part of it is also due to the intensified rivalry between producers,on the one hand, to place their goods attractively before the public, and between distributors, on the other, to obtain trade in competition with eachother, and to the dispersion of the distributive services made necessary  by changes in the distribution of population since the War and the diversificationof those services by the appearance of new wants.
  21,  When account is taken of these factors,much of the increase still remains to be explained and no other explanation seems to offer itself thanthe mere multiplication of distributive agents which, by increasing theoverhead charges of distribution, may afford some explanation of the largemargin between the price the producer receives and the price at which thefinal consumer obtains the product.  It is difficult to believe that thecontinued increase in the numbers of the insured employed in the last twoyears in these trades is economically justifiable since the depression during that period must have brought about a substantial decline in the volume of retail sales,  22.  Despite the assistance afforded to the employment situation by theexpansion of the distributive trades, the development presents severalunsatisfactory features which make it necessary to view without undueoptimism their apparent prosperity.  While the expansion has brought greater opportunities for the employment of women, it is, when considered inconjunction with the greater decline in the opportunities of employment formen, a sign of weakness rather than strength, and can never compensate forthe loss sustained in the heavy basic industries.  Moreover, the increase hasbeen accompanied by a fairly high and increasing rate of unemployment,indicating that the capacity of these trades to afford employment has reachedsaturation point and may well have passed beyond it.     In all the areas, it is common ground that the next step probably willbe a slowing down in the rate of expansion of the distributive services, dueto the decline of population in the depressed areas and a slackening off in intensity of consumption, and that a revival in production may reduce the somewhat artificial balance of advantage at present operating in favour of the distributive trades.  Indeed on Merseyside, where distribution has developedmore rapidly and intensively than elsewhere, it is considered not only thatthis highly artificial stimulus will disappear with reviving trade but that a revival in production may well at first produce a contraction in the numbers employed, though of oourse it must ultimately reflect an increase in numbers.  23.  Further evidence of the industrial vitality of the depressed areas isto be found in the extent to whioh they have developed, even during the postwar depression, new industries.  In South-West Scotland, for example, therehave been established and remain in active operation 155 firms, engaged in                                   10
such, manufactures as mosaic terrazo work, tubular soaff olding, marine turbinesand marine motors, tubes, wire rope, motor tyres and an improved type ofthermostat and in the distribution of motor spirit and in transport; in a timeof depression it is surprising to find some 40 new hosiery firms.     On Merseyside, since 1924 approximately 70 firms with 20 or more workers have commenced work and still remain active.  Of these about 6b employingaltogether 7*000 workers were engaged in some kind of manufacture   17 were inthe clothing group including 2 in the production of artificial silk which alone employ  nearly 2,600 workers! l6 in engineering and metals; 9 in theproduction of oil, paint and chemicals, paper, printing, and other miscell-miscellaneous goods; 9 ^ the manufacture of foodstuffs, and 12 in building.     The industrial vitality of Lancashire is well exemplified by theexpansion of the boot and slipper industry of the Rossendale valley and bythe planned development of the Trafford Park Estate, an entirely new industrial area in which more than 150 firms, covering a wide range of activities, now employ 30,000 to 40,000 workers.  Since the war 64 new firms have taken sites and are now engaged in production and even in the past yearnumbers of new sites have been occupied.  24.  There are fewer indications of the establishment of new industries onthe North-East Coast and in South Wales than in the other depressed areas.On the North East Coast some slight development has taken place in themanufacture of glass bottles, ready-made clothes, laminated springs, rustlesssteel, leather goods, fine chemicals and the extraction of copper, while inSouth Wales there has been a modest development of trades such as boot-making,furniture, weaving, hosiery and poultry keeping, and the comparativeprosperity of an area such as Swansea is attributable to the diversity of minor industries established in or near it.                           PROSPECTS OF EXPANSION.  25.  From what has been said above, it appears clear that any assessment of future prospects must be differentiated as between the staple and otherindustries, but before proceeding to a consideration of the extent of the recovery to be anticipated in individual industries,the probable effects ofcertain factors of general application likely to influence employmentcapacity may be disposed of.
  26.  The first of these relates to the consequences likely to ensue from the departure from the gold standard.  The consensus of opinion in all the areas is that, while the possible effects of this factor in stimulating exports andin retarding importB are not to be ignored, the results obtained therefromhave, on the whole, been disappointing; that the exchange position in generalmay be expected to yield its maximum advantages during the first few monthsonly and that as time goes on these advantages may cease and even pass intodisadvantages.  27.  To this conclusion there is, however, one exception.  In the coalproducing areas there is uniform agreement that the departure from the goldstandard has afforded a certain relief to the coal trade, which may continue,at least for a time.  Although the increased competitive powers abroad,afforded by the change in monetary conditions, have not so far resulted inany great improvement in the volume of trade, the anticipations in SouthWales are that the ultimate effect of the change must be to increase the competitive power of Welsh coal in world markets and particularly-in Balticmarkets.  One other effect that may be expected is that shipping will revert to British instead of Dutch and Belgian ports for bunkering.  On the ForthEast Coast there is some evidence of an increase in coal exports to Hamburgand Antwerp; and Poland, formerly the chief source of Scandinavian countries,now finds it more difficult, to compete with the area since her f.o.b., charges are now practically the same as those of the area.  The most significant newmovement, however, consists in the shipping of coke to the U.S.A.; thatcountry has placed a considerable volume of orders in the area for 1932, andit is anticipated that there will be a similar increase in the near future inthe coal and coke trade with Canada.  In addition,the coal bunkering trade has quite definitely improved.  In Scotland, where the export trade in coal isof relatively less importance, the view is that some temporary help is to beexpected from the exchange position ohiefly in the West Mediterranean trade,providing that the consuming countries there remain on the gold standard, butthat no material assistance is to be expected in the North Sea region or inthe Baltic.  28.  As regards iron and steel, the reactions of the exohange are somewhatobscure; the relation of the currencies of Scandinavia, North Africa,Newfoundland, Spain and Western France, from which iron ore is at present
imported, varies considerably.  On balance the ore will cost industry more,though not to anything like the average depreciation of the  e  sterling.   Onthe other hand, imports of iron and steel come mainly from Belgium,  France,Germany and (in 1931) British India, and there will be a proportionate checkto imports from such of these countries as remain on the gold standard.Consequently^, the depreciation of the  . sterling may be some advantage to exports but not on the whole to any great extent; any substantial  increase of exports has. It is stated, been effectively prevented by the tariff  policies of other countries.  29* In the last quarter of 1931* there occurred in the Lancashire  area,  asubstantial fall in the numbers unemployed, coincident with the departure ofthis country from the gold standard.  In the North-TVest Division of  theMinistry of Labour there was a drop in unemployment of 136,000  of,whom it  isestimated about 80 per cent, were in cotton.  This improvement, however, is less than the bare figures indicate, since some part of it Is due  to theoperation of legislative changes in the Unemployment Insurance  Scheme.Moreover, it must be seen in its right perspective; it still leaves  the numberunemployed about 200,000 above that for the corresponding date for 1929,whileunemployment in the cotton industry was still as high as 27 per cent, asagainst 14 per cent, in 1929.  Further there is clear evidence that  exportsof cotton piece goods have not yet shown any significant expansion.   the departure from the gold standard undoubtedly gave some stimulus to exporttrade but the precarious nature of this advantage has been made evident by thesimilar step recently taken by Japan.  Lancashire appears to have  beenobtaining more trade in China but this is generally attributed to  the boycott of Japanese goods and may well be temporary.  There is, indeed, nothing inthis minor boom of the last quarter of 1931 *c lead the industry to  slackenthe efforts which it has recently been making to restore stability and by reducing costs to restore its trade.  30.  There are also those factors of general application which,  far from increasing future employment oapacity, may well operate to contract  it.     Firstly, there are the effects of rationalisation; these,  so  far atleast as the immediate future is concerned, are likely to be adverse.  Thoughit may be that there is not sufficient evidence to support the view  commonlyheld in the depressed areas that Boards of Directors located in the  Southtend, in times of depression, to distribute the available work in  their own
districts to the detriment of the less central areas, one effect of amalgamatiis said to be undoubted, namely, that it produces an equalisation of wages., atwhere money (but not necessarily real) wages are lower in one district than ^another, equalisation tends to increase cost of production in the area wherenominal wages were formerly lower, and so to restrict employment in it.     A considerable degree of amalgamation has already been effected in thecoal and iron and steel industries, but the full consequences of thatamalgamation on the employment capacities of these industries have probablystill to be experienced.  However that may be, it appears clear that methodsof amalgamations especially when coupled with the curtailment of machinecapacity (as adopted, for example, in the shipbuilding industry and asprojected in the cotton industry) far from increasing employment in the nearfuture, are likely to restrict it.  There is, of course, the chance that, as aresult of reorganisation, efficiency may be so increased that costs and prices will fall, and output and employment increase, but the economies of large scale production often tend to be exaggerated and the process of controllingsurplus capacity is often costly.  314 In the second place, changes and improvements in technique are always in course of being made or in contemplation, which will seriously reduce theamount of employment required for a given output.  The advances already madein this direction have, indeed, been responsible in part for the presentreduced employment capacities of the major industries.     In shipbuilding, for example, changes in design, in methods of building and  in the lay-^aut of work in the yards have, especially since the late war years, resulted in the reorganisation of the labour force and in a displacementof labour amounting in certain sections to as much as 30 to 40 per cent a and itthe  industry as a whole to about 10 per cent.  In the iron and steel industry,considerable economies have been effected by remodelling of mills and other similar methods, so that in the case of some furnaces output has been almostdoubled without addition to the number of men employed^  In one plant in SouthWest Scotland, an output of 2,400 tons of ship plates per week produced by*400 men has, since reconstruction in 1931* been increased to 4,500 tons perweek with only 800 men.     Again, in the coal industry, the proportion of coal cut by machinery hasincreased to 74 per cent, in South West Scotland and to 64 per cent, inNorthumberland; even in South Wales, where the natural difficulties of floor,etc. are said to make the use of coal cutting maohinery more difficult, theproportion cut by machine increased from 4 to 9 Per cent, between 1922 and1929.  Other potent influences in reducing the demand for labour in this industry include the introduction of mechanical conveyors and of electrical power and lighting and other engineering improvements which reduce to aminimum the number of workers not actually engaged in coal cutting.
  32. Despite these advances, there is still ample room in most  industries for the extension or more complete adoption of improved methods  of workingor other similar aids to efficiency and for the consequent further curtail-ment in the volume of labour required for a given output.   To this,  howeverithe coal industry in Scotland and the North East Coast possibly  forms an exception, since in these areas the development of coal cutting  by machinehas proceeded to such lengths that any further extension of it mustnecessarily be small.  33- One of the industries in which changes in technical methods are,because of their recent adoption, likely to play an even more important partin the future than in the past, is the cotton industry where the introductionof high draft spinning, high speed winding and warping, the &apos;more looms perweaver&apos; system, and automatic loom weaving will rapidly increase the  output per person employed and consequently displace labour, if aggregate outputremains the same.  The introduction of the first two of these methods is,however, likely to be slow in view of the shortage of capital for effecting the necessary conversion and the consequent changes in the volume and natureof the labour required will, therefore, be gradual.  Automatic loom weavinghas not made much headway in this country, though, where introduced,  ithas effected phenomenal economies in labour.  The introduction of the &apos;morelooms per weaver&apos; system is likely to have more serious repercussions on employment capacity; the application of the 8 looms system to the weavingof cloths, to which it has already been applied, reduces the volume oftotal labour required by about 30 per cent, while the volume of weavinglabour falls by about 45 per oent. (a) Prospects in the Staple Industries.  34. Apart from these general considerations, there are the factors  likelyto influence the future prosperity of individual  industries.  In the  coal trade, there are the possibilities of expansion through the scientifictreatment of coal on a large scale, either by low temperature carbonisationor by hydrogenation. The latter appears to offer the better long runprospeot, but the determination of the process, out of the many at present being experimented with, which will prove in practice the most economicaland profitable, must inevitably take time and no  immediate large soalerelief from either of these  souroes is to be expected.                                    15
  35* In the iron and steel industry, the prospects on the North East Coastare that the production reached in the period 1924-1931 will be maintained in the next five years; in South Wales a factor which may influence employeoapacity is the possibility of expansion in the home consumption of tinplatsby the development of the canning industry o  This matter is now engaging theattention of tin plate manufacturers and a campaign has been inaugurated for encouraging the food canning industry in Great Britain 5  During the last finyears as many as 30 new canning factories with the most modern equipmenthave been established in this country and the output of cans mounted steadilin the period from 1925 from 1 uu to 30 m* cans o  The home market fortinplate undoubtedly affords great scope for expansiona  36* In Scotland, the future prospects of the pig iron industry are to aconsiderable extent dependent on whether the re-organisation required in itwill take place * The industry is suffering from a number of adverseconditions, which have placed the district at a disadvantage in competition and have reduced it to a very low ebb*  These adverse conditions originatein the exhaustion of the iron ores originally used, necessitating theimportation of ores from other countries and reducing the advantage accruing to the industry from the proximity of the blast furnaces to the coalfields.     So long as supplies of suitable coal remained ample and so long as thequantity of coal required per ton for the production of pig iron remainedhigh, it was relatively more advantageous for the blast furnaces to be located near the coal than near the ports at which the ore entered, but unfortunately, since the war both of these conditions have materiallyaltered, for the supplies of splint coal are becoming  rapidly exhausted andthe quantity of coal required per ton of pig iron has been materiallyreduced *  Further, the Scottish pig iron industry has to meet thecompetition of modern blast furnaces using not raw but coked ooal anddesigned to a higher oapaoity than the  smaller Scottish furnaces.  The blastfurnaces of the region are thus suffering not only from the disadvantages of high transport costs but from modern developments in the use of cokedcoal and larger furnaces *  In this branch, therefore, nothing short of aoomplete reorganisation will meet the  case, and unless this re-organisationtakes plaoe the prospects are dreary in the extreme.
                                                                        ITf  37o This question affects the future prosperity not. only of the pig ironindustry but also of the steel industry in Scotland,   Assuming that there-organisation of the pig iron industry takes place, those best able to judge estimate that, when the present crisis is over and with improved blastfurnaces, the normal annual output of steel ingots should reach that of theyear 1927, namely Igm. tons.  Such a production would leave no seriousunemployment in the steel trade in the region5 there is, indeed, apossibility that this output could be increased, for if means- could be found for producing semi-finished steel products at a cost which could compete with foreign prices, thus displacing semi-finished billets and steel barsat present imported, some 500a000 to 400,000 tons more of ingots would be needed t  38o As regards future prospects in ship-building, experience has shownthat this industry is peculiarly subject to contraction after severeeconomic crises and that recovery is usually slow* Opinion differs widelyon the Clyde as to future employment capacity, varying between a minimum of 40 per cent, and a maximum of 75 per cent, of the number employed in1929s     on balancing the various factors likely to operate in the nextfew years, it is estimated that by the time of the first post crisis year,about 1954j, the volume of labour required will probably be about 60 per cent.of that required in 1929*  On the Forth East Coast it is estimated that,if the area can maintain its proportion of 45 per cent, of British builttonnage, the average annual demand for merchant tonnage in the area in thenext five years will amount to about 6003000 tons as compared with 771,000tons in 1909-1915 and 625,000 tons in 1927-1950.  This anticipated output would  still leave a surplus of about 12,000-15,000 workers even in busy years.     In general engineering, future prospects are on the whole encouraging,though there is evidence of excess capacity in the textile, locomotive and armaments branches *  59* A more detailed examination of future prospects of the stapleindustries is not possible in this memorandum. There is, however, onegeneralisation which may safely be made from all the Surveys.  It is that,so far as the staple industries, including ootton and engineering,, areconcerned, they will indeed be fortunate if they can within the next fewyears  return to the relatively prosperous conditions of 1929*                                 17
(b) Prospects in industries other than the staple.  40. As regards the prospeots of industries other than the staple theposition differs as between the different areas.   In Lancashire theso-called newer industries, contrary to common belief, afford almost asmuch employment as cotton, engineering and coalmining together and these industries have been growing as rapidly in the region as in the country as a whole.  when  the 42 industries, which showed between 1923 and 1929at least a 10 per cent. advance in the number of employed insured in thecountry as a whole, are taken together, the percentage increase in these industries in the survey region was about the same (27 as against 29 percent.) as in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and they gave employment to about 100,000 more insured persons in 1929-1931 than in 1923.   Inaddition there is a number of industries such as brass and copper,cardboard box manufacture, tanning and currying, not included in thegroup, which show a much larger increase in employment in the region thanelsewhere.     On Merseyside, while there has been acute depression in shipping andtransport services, it is definitely concluded that the manufacturing industries, which in that region acoount for about one-third of the totalemployed, can look forward to a period of steadily advancing trade.Indeed, the prospects of this group are stated to be more hopeful thanthey have been for many years, provided that the existing policy  ispursued of allowing the sterling exchange rate to find its own level.     In Southwest Scotland,, the estimates of the numbers of males whoare likely to be employed in the first normal post-crisis year  (about1934)  show anticipated increases of about 3,000, 1,200 and 1,500respectively in building, transport, and distribution with relativelyless substantial advances in a large number of minor industries, not to speak  of anticipated advances in some of the staple industries, e.g.5*800  in general engineering, 1,000 in metal manufacture and metal trades,and 700 in coal mining.   41.  The projected expansion of the more diversified industries  in thethree  areaB named above,, has4, however, no counterpart on the North-East
Coast or in South Wales.   In both these areas the real seriousness ofthe position is derived from their ultra-spooialisation in a limited number of basic industries.   In both of them there is a comparativedearth of industries other than the heavy basic industries.   On the North-East Coast the chief of such industries, after chemicals, are shipping,clothing, saw-milling, furniture, printing, and confectionery, and in none of these, except perhaps in chemicals, is there any ground for thinking that there will be expansion of any considerable amount.   Some of thelighter manufacturing industries, sinoe they occupy in the area a relatively less important placo then in other districts, may continue to expand slightly, but such expansion olearly will not suffice to offset the diminution in the basic industries.  42. Similarly, in South Wales the prospects of expansion in the subsidiary industries rest on a few of the minor metal trades.   Muchsuccess has attended the efforts of the nickel industry to find a peace-timeoutlet for a plant expanded to meet war time demands.   The present  outputof nickel already approximates closely to the war time volume and there  is every prospect of this amount being exceeded.   In copper manufacturingadditional uses are being found for some copper productss and given agreater degree of stability in the price of raw copper and an improvementin the world situation, there is a good future in prospects   In thesmelting and oil refining industries there are also possibilities of expansion if the world situation improves, but there are now clearindications that little further expansion, if any, can be looked for inthe  distributive and catering trades.  43. Prom these assessments of the prospects of expansion there emerges ,a more or less clear differentiation between Lancashire includingMerseyside and South-West Scotland on the one hand and the North-east coast and South Wales on the other.   The former conveysa picture oftwo  areas suffering severely, it is true, from the effects of world conditions but only awaiting the turn of the world tide to take full advantage of it, and to reach again levels of comparative prosperity.
  44. It is otherwise with the two latter areas. On the North-East Coast theconclusion is definite that the area is likely to play in the future a less important part in the economy of the country than in the past, and that itwill require to adjust itself to a permanently lower level of activity. Somesteps towards this readjustment have been made but a position of equilibriumhas not yet been established and the continued migration of workers to other centres of industry is considered still to be necessary.     The area has only participated to a small extent in the development ofnew industries, and has admittedly failed to take its proper place in meeting the comparatively recent demand for such articles as motor cars and wireless equipment.  For this, the reason is inherent in the area itself,forbecause of its remoteness from other centres of population the North-east coast is at a oisadvantage as a distributing centre and these new industries,unless they are able to take advantage of cheap sea transport, can established themselves more economically elsewhere.  In future, therefore, it will beneoessary for the area to look further afield than in coal, iron, ships, and engineering.  This is a transition which may present difficulty in view ofthe highly specialised nature of industry in the region, but other districtshave in the past overcome similar difficulties and the North-East Coast isnow faced with the necessity of doing so.  45 * What has been said above of the North-East Coast is also true of SouthWales,  Only in the Swansea area is there any diversification of industryand consequently it has lost a smaller fraction of its population bymigration than any other district of South Wales and its imports and exports have been better maintained.  As regards the rest of South Wales, itscomplete dependence upon coal, coupled with the comparative isolation of themining valleys and the dearth of other industries, has induced a chronicunemployment for which it is suggested that the only remedy lies in the deliberate creation of new industries to absorb the surplus of the old.                      THE ESTIMATED SURPLUS OF LABOUR.  46 0 This analysis of the present industrial position of the depressed  areas and assessment of their future employment capacities leads to theconsideration of the extent of the apparent surplus of labour to theexistence of which in all the depressed areas the unemployment figures                                    20.
inevitably point.  The chief difficulty is to give quantitative expression to it.     When account is taken of the variety and number of factors, present and prospective, which are likely to exercise some kind of influence,  large or small, upon the labour surplus of particular areas, the task of estimatingits magnitude must clearly be highly speculative and the result, whenachieved, lacking in scientific preoision0  Thus in the estimates  which havebeen made, no account has been taken of such imponderable factors  as  possiblelegislative provisions effecting changes in the fiscal system or in the ageof entry into industry, or of incalculable changes in taste and fashion, all of which may, by varying the supply of or demand for labour, affect the size of the labour surplus ..  47. The estimates made in each area are based primarily on the unemploymentrecorded in the various industries, though, as will be seen below, the assumptions and hypotheses, on which the problem of the surplus is discussed,differ profoundly as between the areas .  The fundamental difficulty whichpresents itself is that of fixing a base period which is typical of normalpost-war conditions . It has already been indicated (paragraph 8 above) thatfor this purpose 1929 is the most appropriate year, and, broadly speaking,that year forms the njumping-off ground&quot; in reference to which the futuredemand for labour is calculated.  It is, however, a task of even greater difficulty to fix the future year by reference to which the supply of available labour is to be calculated.  This is a matter of some importancein determining the size of the surplus; for the longer the interval,  thegreater will be the total annual excess of candidates for entry into  theindustrial field over those leaving it.  Subject to these reservations, theestimates of surplus labour as disclosed by the Surveys, may be briefly,                                               o                                                                         f  Jthough somewhat imperfectly, given in the form of the table below.Area.	Estimated Surplus.		Total Both Sexes.	Men and Boys.	Women and Girls.	Lancashire.	120,000	40,000	160,000Merseyside.	-	-	90,000North East Coast.	64,000	No problem.	64,000South Wales.	-	-	40,000*South West of			Scotland.	100,000	No problem.	100,000* 40,000 if trade develops, 70,000 or more if deoay continues, plus an  undetermined number of surplus juveniles in future years.
  48. In considering these figures it is necessary to point out that neitherabsolutely nor relatively are they comparable with one another.  In the firstplace they relate to different years. The figure for South-West Scotlandrelates, for example, to a future year called the &quot;first normal post-crisisyear&quot;  jarhieh is placed at 1934. On the North-East Coast and Merseyside, thefigures relate to a five year period after 1931* In South Wales, the figurerelates in fact to the surplus existing in 1930* while in Lancashire theestimate has been made upon the basis of the unemployment figures for 1929.  49* secondly, there are important differences in the treatment of that norm!burden of unemployment whioh industry under the most favourable conditions muicarry, in order to allow for the ordinary floating movement of workers betwee:jobs, etc.  In Scotland, Lancashire and Wales, the surplus is taken as including the whole of the estimated unemployed and no allowance for this very necessary element has entered into the calculation. Account has, it is true,been taken of it in the estimated surpluses for the North-East Coast- andMerseyside, but at the rate of 3 per cent, of the insured&apos; population in the OE)case and between 8 and 9 Ver cent, in the other.  50. In the third place,differences,not explainable in terms of variations inlooal conditions, evince themselves in the hypotheses, on which are based theoaloulations of the rate at which in future years workers entering industry will be in excess of those who leave it through retirement, death, &amp;c. It isonly necessary to contrast in this respect the estimate of 50*CCC for this itetin South-West Scotland for the period up to 1934, with the correspondingestimate for the North-East Coast, which proceeds on the assumption that up to1936 at least, new entrants into industry will only balance those who leave itand that accordingly no allowance for this item is necessary.  51* Despite these differences of treatment and method, into the merits ofwhich it is unnecessary to enter, so great is the magnitude of the labourproblem in each region, that the value and signifioance of the estimates madecannot be fundamentally affeoted by them. The importance of the estimatesrests on the fact, that though quantitativaly they are imperfect and can, bythe nature of the case, only be regarded as approximations,qualitatively theyreflect the nature of the problem of surplus labour with which the regions are confronted. The conclusion, whioh inevitably emerges from a consideration ofthe Surveys, is that in all the regions there exists a large body of workpeople^who are definitely surplus to requirements and for whom provision willrequire to be made.
