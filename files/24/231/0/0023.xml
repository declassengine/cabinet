It will he seen that the method followed lias been to takea selected topic and to find out what is  the largest area of common ground.  This method has had considerable success, and I directparticular attention to the provisional agreement in respect of airbombing.  The conversations are being continued on other subjects, andby the end of the week we  shall at.any rate know  something of themeasure of common agreement over the whole field  so far as thosethree delegations are concerned.  Of course, everything is provisionalupon the whole being found satisfactory.   The Cabinet will understandthat President Hoover&apos;s sudden manifesto, couched in very muchbroader terms, was distinctly disturbing  to these private and  &apos;detailed discussions.  But it is intended they should.go on.the General Commission of the Conference by Mr. Gib SOB. onWednesday afternoon.  The Cabinet may be interested to know how much notice the Prime Minister and I had of this proceeding.  Avague hint was given on Sunday night that President Hoover had somelarge proposals in his mind and an outline of them was sketchedverbally under terms of profound secrecy and, as the Prime Minister(2)  The statement of President Hoover&apos;s proposals read to

A similar and equally secret communication was made &quot;bythe American delegation to the French at a wayside inn betweenLausanne and Geneva late at night on Monday;  I understand fromMonsieur Paul-Boncour that it was equally vague.  On Tuesdaymorning at lls Mr. Gibson hurried to inform me that the secretwas out, suggesting that the French had &quot;leaked&quot;.  ConsequentlyPresident Hoover had determined to make his announcementimmediately, and it was at that moment coming across in cypherfrom Washington.  I pointed out that if it was desired to havedue consideration from us with a vie?/ to our support, this gaveno time.  Mr. Gibson came over to Lausanne at my request and  saw the Prime Ministers but the Americans maintained that delay wasimpossible.  Consequently, President Hoover made his announcement in Washington on Wednesday at 10.30, and  the General commission was summoned for 40 30 p.m. (the corresponding Swiss time) inorder that a communication might be made simultaneously at Geneva.     (3)  I thought it best to follow Mr. Gibson in the discussion at once so as to make plain that the proposals \7ere no part of an anglo-American arrangement, but had been sprung on us all alike,while at the same time I spoke warmly of their scope and boldness,mailing certain reservations in order that there should be nomisrepresentation hereafter.  I append the substance of what  I said, on the chance that my colleagues may care to look through it.     It seems to me that in considering this matter we have tokeep three large matters in mind.     (i)  the necessity of bringing to the front our own BritishPlan on bold and practical lines;  Britain must not lag behindAmerica in zeal for Disarmament.   We have in fact now assembled                              -2-
a &quot;better set of proposals, and a far more practical set.  but owing to the delay in getting clear decisions, the effect hasbeen largely lost by producing items piece-meal.    (ii)  We must firmly maintain our stand for what isnecessary for the special purposes of the British Commonwealth.I was careful to say in my speech that it seemed to me thatthe Hoover Plan did not allow sufficiently for the variedresponsibilities of different naval Powers.   (At the same time a well-judged,  all-round reduction would be an immense relief to everybody).   (iii)  The relation between Geneva and Lausanne is immenselyimportant.  No-one would dream of sacrificing the necessities of British and Imperial defence to any other  considerationbut the fact is that if we can shew ourselves forthcomingand sympathetic to the American proposals, we shall create amuch better atmosphere for the discussions of American  debtthan if we do not.

ANNEX I.   SUMMARY OF  COWER SATTQKS CONDUCTED BETWEEN FRENCH,   AMERICAlT AITD&apos; BRITISH R,EPRES.H]NTATIVES AT GENEVA.      It  may &quot;be advisable  to  summarise the results of the first meetings with the French  and American Delegates at Geneva,      We  have  sat  so  far morning  and afternoon on Monday and Tuesday  and have  covered  about half of our agenda.   The meet- ings  have been most  friendly;  there have been no serious dis- agreements and definite conclusions have been reached on several points.    The French have made it  clear that, while adhering to their general position as to the extent of disarmament depend- ing upon adequate measures to ensure further security, they are willing  to leave that question in  abeyance for the purpose of these conversations  and to discuss what measures can be agreed on the basis  that provisions for security remain as they now are.      We  took  first the question  of the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological  warfare as that was the one matter on which.,., a  Commission  of Experts had agreed.   We endorsed the recommen- dations  of that committee, but emphasis was laid by the French upon  the  general measures of control to be embodied in the Treaty being adequate to ensure  the observance of prohibition of this form  of warfare.   They were also anxious that there should be special penalties for infraction, but were unable at this stage to  suggest what they should be.     We next  turned to the question of air armaments,  as theFrench Delegates were anxious to have this matter discussed be- cause one of  them - M.  de Jouvenel - was  to  speak on the subject on Wednesday at the meeting of the Air Commission of the Disarma-ment Conference.     The British Delegation stated that  if it  were possible  to propose an effective  scheme for  the entire abolition  of  militaryand naval aviation and  if  there  were  any  likelihood  of its general acceptance by  the  Conference,  we  should not have opposed such a                          (i)
scheme in principle,  hut  it  appeared that  these two conditionscould not &quot;be fulfilled.   The dangers to which the civil popula-tion might he exposed in  time of war,  even if the prohibitionof the use of gas was effective,  were emphasised by all partiesto the discussion and there  was  very complete agreement that definite steps should be  taken for their protection.     The French proposal,  which had been made in a memorandum to the Disarmament Conference dated April  14th, was the main sub-ject for discussion,  and  it  was  unanimously accepted as the bestproposition that had been made and as likely to prove  adequate for this purpose.   This  proposal, which the British Delegateshope may be acceptable to the Cabinet,  with the additions made toit as the result of cur discussions, is the following:-     Aerial bombing shall be prohibited except:        1. In the neighbourhood of actual  military operations,           that is to say within a certain distance to be fixed,           of a line where two military forces are in  contact           in time of war.    The actual distance is reserved for           joint expert examination with the indication that           the three delegations desire that it should be fixed           &quot;at the lowest possible figure  consistent with techni-           cal realities&quot;.        2. In the case of air bases and long-range gun emplacements.        3. In a zone to be fixed along the sea coast where bombing           would be permitted within a distance which  should           bear a relation to the range of naval guns;  and in           respect of objectives, the naval bombardment of which           was permitted  under the Hague Convention.,   In other           words, the action of aeroplanes in the coastal area           will be subject to precisely the same limitations as           now extend to  naval actiono     It was made clear that  the restriction of bombarding was notto apply to measures taken for the prevention or stopping ofraids or other disturbances  in Imperial or Colonial
-J 0 0possessions fyr Mandated. Territories.   Both the French and american Delegations fully recognised the necessity for thisexception which the British Delegation had urged.   after considering possible formulae for effecting this object,M. Paul-Boneour suggested that it might be most simply done if the restrictions on bombing as specified were to apply, likethe rest of the treaty, as between the High Contracting PartiesBy this very simple procedure no restrictions would be placed upon any measures which a Power with colonial possessionsmight find it necessary to use in order to assert its authority within those possessions.  (it is possible that difficulty might arise on the North-Western Frontier of Indiaif Afghanistan should become a party to the Convention and ifaggressive action were taken by some of the tribes livingbeyond cur border&quot;.  This aspect may require special consideration).   This solution of the question appears to useminently satisfactory if it can secure the assent of theConference as a whole;  it will be an immense relief to thecivil population throughout Europe.  It avoids all difficulties with regard to the definition of distant military objectives;such problems as whether the presence of an arsenal or abarracks or a munition factory in a particular town would render legitimate the dropping of bombs on that town will nolonger arise.           With regard to restrictions on the size of bombingaeroplanes, here again we have reached a provisional agreement.It is proposed that the maximum unladen weight should be 3tons (not 5 tons as previously suggested).  The British Delega-tion pointed out/the necessity, however, of not preventing theuse of large planes for carrying troops or stores in oversea
territories and this was at once recognised by the other twodelegations.   It was agreed, however, that the number of suchplanes should he limited and  the  tentative suggestion was made that the number should be fixed in relation to the size ofthe garrisons where the troops were stationed.     The Americans asked that flying-boats should also be thesubject of special exemption.   Agreement was reached on thelorinciple that there should be exceptions in these and possiblysome other cases, and the formulation of the conditions of such exceptions was referred to a joint Committee of the experts ofeach delegation.    (It was also decided that with regard tothis and other matters the meetings of experts should be attended by political members of the delegations.)     The question of fixing a maximum unit volume fordirigibles was also referred for expert consideration.     There was a general desire that the numbers of militaryand naval aeroplanes possessed by each country s.hould belimited, but no progress was made as to finding a principle  onwhich the numbers should be based.   The French fully agreedthat it would not be right to relate the numbers of aeroplanesto the size of armies as this would put the countries withoutconscript armies at a very unfair disadvantage.   It was thought possible, however, that after further study some basisof agreement might be reached as between the three delegations sthough we are ourselves inclined to doubt whether any rule islikely to be found which would be acceptable to Italy andother Powers.   The experts are also to consider whether there;should be a limit of total tonnage as well as a limit of numbers.     We next turned to what has been called the French Plan forthe Internationalisation of Civil Aviation, but which as.
appeared from the explanations that were given is  quitewrongly designated by that name.    In the first place,  the             nowFrench do no &quot;J/propose that whatever measures are adoptedshould apply to any hut the largest aeroplanes, that is  those over &apos;5 tons, possession of which is to he prohibited to governments - except for a limited number of troop-carriers.     The question of any form of control of manufacture,  or  of licensing the possession, of the  ordinary small plane owned  by private individuals does not therefore arise.    Secondly,the French are not no?/ putting forward their plan for placinglarge planes at the disposal of the League of Nations.    Theactual project now before us is for a measure of international control over the big air liners,  the object being to preventthe formation, with the help of subsidies, of powerful fleets  oflarge planes, which a country which was prepared to break the law/- might use most destructively for bombingo    The Frenchlaid great emphasis upon the necessity for this, and indeeddeclared definitely that they would not agree to the abolitionof the large bombing machine unless effective means were  taken toprevent planes of similar size, ostensibly provided for civilian purposes, being available as substitutes.   Theirpresent plan, which has been worked out in great detail,  isin effect the creation of an international organisation on lines more or less resembling the Wagon-Lit Company, which is  to run the long-distance air services much as the sleeping-cartrains are run.   Special provision should be made to ensure   ^that countries which desire to see established long-distancelines to their colonial or other possessions should be ableto secure that this would be effected through the internationalcompany.   It is claimed that, apart from the first                       (v)
consideration that has teen mentioned, this plan would he desirable in itself as it v/ould prevent the unnecessarymultiplication of competing air lines and v/ould greatlydiminish the amount of subsidies paid by the various governments.   We feel some doubt whether such a scheme v/ouldwork efficiently and whether it is not more elaborate than theconditions require;  it might be possible to have a more restricted form of control under the supervision of the Leagueof Nations which would effect the main purpose in view.    Butit is obviously important not to impose a direct negative uponthe French proposal and we readily agreed to the suggestion oftheir delegation that the Air Committee of the conference should appoint a smaller sub-committee to go into this subjectmore closely.     At our fourth meeting we discussed questions of qualitativeland disarmament, and first the proposal with regard to heavy artillery.    Here we were hoping to secure an agreement forthe prohibition of mobile land guns of a calibre above about&apos;1 (155mm).    M.  Paul-Boncour raised a point, however, whichis undoubtedly of serious importance.    He pointed out thatit was impossible to require coastal defences to be providedv/ith guns of a smaller calibre than those of the ships which might  attack them.    The forts of Marseilles could notbe limited to 6&quot;  guns to meet an attack from battleshipsarmed v/ith 12&quot; guns.    But in the view of the French delegation and their military advisers it was not in fact possible toprevent guns authorised for coastal defence from being usedin land warfare.    If one country attacked another, havingbroken the pact against going to war, it v/ould not scruple tobreak a convention which prohibited it from using its coastaldefence guns in the campaign, while the defending country could                         (vi)
not be  expected to refrain from doing so in resisting the aggression.  As a matter of fact, he said, many of thesecoastal defence guns were not physically fixed; they were already mounted on rails in order that they&quot;might be movedfram one loop-hole of a fort to another and to transfer themto the ordinary railways was a simple matter.  With regard to others, it was not the case that it would take very long tsmanufacture the mountings necessary to convert them from fixedto mobile artillery.  Furthermore, it is necessary that theconvention should be easily enforceable and that infractionsshould be verifiable without too much difficulty, but if guns of heavy calibre wore still to be permissible for coastaldefences and for ships it would be impossible to say that anysuch guns that were being manufactured were really intended forland warfare.     In the course of the discussion the French Delegationagreed:-     1.  That whatever figure was agreed internationally, either             by the Washington Convention or by the Convention now             under negotiation, for the maximum calibre of naval-             guns, they would agree also as the maximum for land             artillery.     2.  That a figure should be fixed with expert advice             which should be regarded as the maximum size of the             normal artillery required by armies.     3.  That heavy land artillery above that calibre should             be limited in number, that the allocation of each             piece should be registered with the Commission of             Control and that the number of such guns at present             existing should not be exceeded, although there might             be replacements.      Turning to tanks, it was agreed that the complete abolition     of tanks was wrcng in principle and could not be adopted,,                                 ( vii)
        With regard to  the maximum weight, the French were quite  willing to fix a limit.  They had a considerable number of tanks  of  70 tons, and their experts hitherto had suggested that as the  appropriate maximum,  M, Paul-Boncour, however, understood that  the British Gcverment favoured a figure of about 25 tons and he  was willing to approximate to that.  The French had, however,  a number of tanks of a 25 ton pattern, the v/eight of which had  been considerably increased by the attachment of much heavier  caterpillars, bringing them up to about 32 tons, and he would  suggest that as the limit.  We asked whether that might not be  very considerably reduced, but were met by the argument that it  was a question of what weight was adequate to give sufficient  armour protection against ordinary artillery used by armies,  M. Paul -*-B one our suggested that it was a matter for joint expert  determination to decide hov/ that principle should be applied and  what weight of tank should be agreed to as the outcome.  We  suggested that existing tanks ever the agreed limit should be  scrapped. -  a proposal which the French did not reject,  but they  asked for an opportunity to give it further consideration.       The American Delegation indicated that their Government  would have been glad to see the total abolition of tanks,  but if  that were impossible they would co-operate in finding a maximum  limit of size.       We have had informal conservations with Signor Grandi and  with Herr Nadolny,  the German Delegate,  in  order to keep them3  informed of the course of events,                                   (Intd.)

1 9. QANNEXStatement of toe instructions issuedby President Hoover to the American delegation to the Conference for theLimitation and Reduction of Armaments,read by Ambassador Gibson before theGeneral Commission, June 22, 1932,               4,30 p.m.     The delegations at the World Conference on Disarmament atGeneva are now engaged in discussions as to methods by which more comprehensive efforts can be made toward disarmament.     The following is the substance of instructions which havebeen given by the President to the American Delegation for guidance in the discussions which are now occupying them.    They are published in order that the American people may be fully anda c cur a t e ly i nf o rme d.     &quot;The time has come when we should cut through the brush andadopt some broad and definite method of reducing the overwhelmingburden of armament which now lies upon the toilers of the world.This would be the most important world step that could be taken to expedite economic recovery,   We must make headway against the mutual fear and friction arising out of war armament which killhuman confidence throughout the world.   We can still remain prac-tical in maintaining an  adequate self-defence among all nations.We can add to theworld from ten tonext ten years.assurances ol peacefifteen billions ofand yet save the people of thewasted dollars during the         I propose that the following principles should be our guide.         First:  The Kellogg-Briand Pact to which we are all signatories    can only mean that the nations of the world have agreed that they    will use their arms solely for defence.         Second; This reduction should be carried out not only by broad I   general cuts in armaments but by increasing the comparative power^\ of defence through decreases in the power of the attack.         Third:  The armaments of the world have grown up in mutual    relation to each other, and speaking generally such relativity    should be preserved in making reductions.     Fourth; The reductions must be real and positive.    They musteffect economic relief,                                                            i j :     Fifth:  There are three problems to deal with - land forces,air forces and naval forces.   They are all inter-connected.   no part of the proposals which I make can be dis-associated one fromthe other.     Based on these principles I propose that the arms of the worldshould be reduced by nearly one-third.     Land forces.   In order to reduce the offensive character of allland forces as distinguished from their defensive character Ipropose the adoption of the presentation already made at the geneva conference for the abolition of all tanks, all chemical warfare andall large mobile guns.    This would not prevent the establishment orincrease of fixed fortifications of any character for the defence of frontiers and seacoasts.    It would give an increased relativestrength to such defence as compared with attack.                          ,..   (i)
     I propose, furthermore, that there should be a reductionof one-third in strength of all land armies over and above theso-called police component.     The land armaments of many nations are considered to havetwo functions.    One is the maintenance of internal order inconnection with the regular peace forces of the country.    Thestrength required for this purpose has been called the &quot;policecomponent&quot;.   The other function is defence against foreignattack.   The additional strength required for this purposehas been called the &quot;defence component&apos;1.   While it is not suggested that these different components should be separated itis necessary to consider this contention as to functions in pro-posing a practical plan of reduction in land forces.,   Under theTreaty of Versailles and the other peace treaties the armies ofGermany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria were reduced to a sizedeemed appropriate for the maintenance of internal order, Germanybeing assigned one hundred thousand troops for a population ofapproximately sixty five million people.   I propose that weshould accept for all nations a basic police component of soldiersproportionate to the average which was thus allowed Germany andthese other states.   This formula with necessary corrections forPowers having colonial possessions should be sufficient to providefor the maintenance of internal order by the nations of the world.Having analysed these two components in this fashion, I proposeas stated above that there should be a reduction of one third inthe strength of all land armies over and above the policecomponent.     Air Forces.   All bombing planes to be i abolished.   Thiswill do away with the&quot;^mTlrtraTy possession of types of planescapable of attacks upon civil populations and should be coupled with the&quot;Tdtal^                   bombardment from the air.     Naval forces.   I propose that the treaty number and tonnageof battleships shall be reduced by one third; that the treatytonnage &quot;of aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers shall bereduced by one&quot;&quot;&quot;f ourth; that the treaty tonnage&quot;^of submarines shallbe reduced by one third and that no nation shall retain a submarinetonnage greater than 35,000 tons.     The relative strength of naval arms in battleships and air-craft carriers as between the five leading naval powers was fixed by the Treaty of Washington.     The relative strength in cruisers, destroyers and submarineswas fixed as between the United States, Great Britain, and Japanby the Treaty of London.    For the purpose of this proposal it issuggested that the French and Italian strength in crxiisers and destroyers be calculated as though they had joined in. the Treatyof London on a basis aporoximating the so called accord of Marclil,1931.     There are various technical considerations connected withthese naval reductions which will be presented by the delegation at Geneva.     General.    The effect of this plan would be to effect an enormous saving in cost of new construction and replacements ofnaval vessels.    It would also save large amounts in the operatingexpense in all nations of land,  sea and air forces.    It would greatly reduce offensive  strength compared to defensive strength in all nations.
     These proposals are simple and direct.    They call upon all nations to contribute something.    The contribution hereproposed will be relative and mutual.    I know of nothing thatwould give more hope for humanity today than the  acceptancecf such a program v.ith such minor changes as might be&quot;necessary.   It is folly for the world to go on breaking itsback over military expenditures and the United States is willing to take its share of responsibility by making definite proposals that will relieve the world,&quot;
