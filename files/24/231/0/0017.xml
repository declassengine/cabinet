 CYPHER telegram  fron  the High Commissioner  for  Iraq to  the Secretary of State  for the Colonies. (Dated 18th June 1933.  Received, Colonial  Office,           7015  a0rao       18th June 1932 h Immediate. No.211,          Your telegram No0152 (A) health.  Air Officer Commanding assures me that medical and other requirements are normal to this country and arrangements have been made to  complete all  necessary  preparations at a few days&apos; noticeo  Air Officer Commanding is dealing with these and military matters in a signal to Air Ministry.  (B) strategic, Modifications suggested by &quot;7ar Office that battalion should be kept concentrated would not usable us achieve our purpose (? as)  levies and families cannot be collected in one piace0  I have no alternative to SUg ?8St.          We are satisfied that preseage of British troops at Hosulp Diana, Sulaimaniyah and Hinaidi at time of disarmament of levies would provide best chance of holding sufficient number of levies to prevent Assyrian concentration being effective.  (G) Political.   We are confident that levies will hand in their arms and equipment without making any fuss.  *Ve believe that presence of British troops will restrain them  from any attempt forcibly to resistdefca&amp;tioa.  In any event we have never intended that British troops should firo on Assyrians attempting to escape^  It will therefore be physically possible for
 levies  to  escape  from detention but we do not think that many will attempt  to do so because some would be restrained by the  presence of their families and by difficulties which we shall place in way of obtaining transportD others                     .   .....                    ?        ..- would be restrained by respect for their (British) comrades and by  their secret desire to continue in the British service.   Once the plan for general concentration had been frustrated men who still wish to leave could be discharged gradually without danger at a rato which Air Officer Commanding estimates at about 75 a weeko          We anticipate at the end of two or at the most three months men who regained would wish to take service in air  defence fcffOS.  Crisis would then be over as far as Levies  are concerned and British troops would no longer  be necessary *           Hfoployment of Iraqi troops would in our opinion be most provogative and therefore dangerous.           (latest date of arrival of) first company of battalion  is 21st June.  This would ensure last Company would be in position on 27th June.           I will deal with question of Assyrians claim when I  have received reply from Leaders due on 18th June0
