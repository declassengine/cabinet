THIS DOCOMEHT IS &apos;ZHE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTYT S GOVERNMENT.S E 0 RET. CP.234(32)                              CABINET.                               DISARMAMENT.                 Note by the  Plrst  Lord of the Admiralty.                 I wish to correct  a misapprehension that may have       arisen in the minds of my colleagues after reading the       comments I circulated on CP. 164(32).-                 My paper, CP.182(32), in the final paragraph,       stated that - &quot;While the Admiralty are in favour of Germany       being released from the Category system of the Versailles       Treaty, it is not considered that she should be permitted       to possess submarines&quot;.   The Admiralty policy would be       more correctly represented by saying that they advocate       that Germany should be given a time limit to the  Disarmament       Clauses of the Peace Treaty, if in return she would accept       little or no increase on the Versailles Treaty figures for       a short term treaty.                 It should also be part of any such agreement that       Germany accepted the limitations of the Standard  Category       System, which would not permit transfer from surface craft       to submarine tonnage.                 Subject to the above conditions, the Admiralty  do       not suggest that the absolute prohibition on the  construction )       of submarines by Germany ought to be maintained.                                   B.  E.  M. dtfRAlTY, S.W.1.   29th June,, 1932.
