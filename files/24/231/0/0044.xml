DECLARATION  OF  BRITISH  DISARMAMENT  POLICY.   1.  THE Disarmament Conference has  reached  a stage when wemust review  the  present position of our discussions and co-operatewithout loss of time in reaching and registering practical conclusions.The Government  of  the  United  Kingdom most  cordially  welcomePresident  Hoover&apos;s declaration as a contribution to this end.   we welcome it alike because it  calls for a  really substantial measure of disarmament and  because  it  seeks to  apply the  two principles of quantitative and of qualitative limitation.   As President Hoover says,&quot; Reduction should be  carried out  not  only by broad  general cutsin armaments,  but by increasing the comparative  power of defencellirough decreases in the power  of the attack.&quot; We  desire to associateourselves  with  these  conceptions  and to contribute all  that we  canto secure  their practical application. The United  Kingdom cabinet has considered President Hoover&apos;s Declaration in this spirit and what1 am about to say on certain practical points is said with a deep desireto promote co-operation and agreement.   Success at  Geneva  depends  upon  general  agreement,  and  theAmerican  delegation  has made   it plain  that President  Hoover&apos;sproposals  are put forward  as  a  contribution to an agreed general programme.   The  United   Kingdom   Government  have  alreadyadvanced wide suggestions of their own.  These, while they differ insome important respects as to method or measure, are inspired by thesame purpose,  and a comparison will  show that already there is  asubstantial area of common ground.  Without interrupting or anticipating detailed discussions whichmust take place with the other delegations represented at Geneva, itis convenient at this  moment  to  set out in  broad  outline the maincharacteristics of the United Kingdom proposals.  They in their turnshould be regarded,  as I have said, not as a declaration of isolatedaction, but as. a contribution to  general agreement.  2.  First, the  Government of the United Kingdom desire to puton  record  their agreement-with  President  Hoover on the furtherprinciple  that  the  three  problems of  Military,  Naval  and  AirDisarmament are  inter-connected.  International agreement  cannotbe attained without an adequate contribution from  all three sources.Inasmuch as Britain,  like the  United States, finds her strongest armin the navy,  the contribution which concerns her most is to be foundin  this sphere,  in  which,  as   is  well-  known,   contributions  to disarmament on the largest scale  have already been  made in advanceof the General Disarmament Conference.   Nevertheless,  the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom now offer  a further contribution as partof a  general world settlement.
7.&quot;&apos;,&quot;                   &quot;&quot;LAND PROPOSALS.    4.   In the realm erf land disarmament His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin  the  United Kingdom  find themselves in  full accord with  thetsubstance of President  Hoover&apos;s proposals.   Naturally,  it  will be^riaeessary carefully to examine the  details before expressing a  finalopinion  on their suitability to the situation of each country.  -15,0 5. &apos; To consider in turn the  four categories to which these pro-posals&apos; relate :                                      -  -  -&quot;&quot;  (a) In regard  to  the. strength  of  land  armies,  His  Majesty^government  have  consistently  placed in  the  forefront  of   their^proposals for land disarmament the  examination  of measures for thereduction of effectives to  the lowest level  compatible with nationalsafety.   So  far as their own forces  are  concerned, His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not only abolished conscription, but  have already&apos;effected  reductions to the minimum  numbers required for the preser-&quot;Wition of internal order and for the  defence of their overseas posses-Vioris and communications.  If we take account of the whole BritishSirtny; including  not  only British troops . in  Great Britain and herHSWofries, but also those maintained  in India, the personnel has been^reduced, as compared with the year  before the War, from 259,000 to&apos;207&apos;,;000, and this has been effected by the disbandment of 9 regimentsr6f&apos; cWvalry, 61 batteries  and companies of artillery, &apos; 21 ^companies ofBoya! Engineers,  21 battalions of infantry,  arid G battalions of colonial and troops locally enrolled.                   &quot;    The  United States proposal for  a division of land  forces into  a^--police component&quot; and  a &quot;defence component &quot; will&apos; require yerycareful examination;  but,  so far  as His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the&quot;i^nited&apos;::Kingdom understand the  implication of the suggested basis of&amp;&apos;afclrlation,  the result will-be to show  that the British land  fortes;ttavfe already been reduced substantially below the number  recognised!ttvbe necessary for the maintenance  of internal order,  without making!&apos;Si\y allowance  for the forces needed for the lines of communication^Between the United Kingdonrand the territories overseas.        In regard  to chemical and bacteriological warfare  His Ma-jesty&apos;s-&quot;Government in the United Kingdom have&apos;already joined in rejecting-ih&apos;e rise  of these methods of warfare and therefore cordially welcome&apos;th&apos;e&apos;United States proposals under this head.    (fay-In -regard  to  land guns, His MajestyV Government  in thesuited  Kingdom &quot;have proposed the abolition of all mobile guns of i;8frRhi&apos;e greater than 155 mm&apos;&quot; (61 inches calibre). Under this head%s&apos;o&quot; His ^Majesty&apos;s   Government  in  the  United  Kingdom  find^therhselvesv therefore, in general agreement with the  proposals of tin1iUirifed States Government.     &apos;
I     i iln/xeg&amp;vdiito -jtonksIiiHisi iMajesty,&apos;is iGev^uiameiifc-!ini tils UnitedJvriigdomhfitad iithemaelveS eaktirteljlvatri bnenwiih Breaidehfc iHooveinin^siring^ihpfi&amp;pplieatic^^ijhto                           r offensiveweapons  should  be prohibited.   His Majesty&apos;s - Government  havealready advocated the abolition of  all heavy tanks by which they meanthose tanks which by  their characteristics are especially suitable;for offensive employment in battle.   Tanks  of  the lighter type  cannot be . regarded  as  specificallyoffensive   weapons.    Their  comparatively  light  armour   andthen  reduced capacity for crossing trenches  render them  unsuitable for the assault of highly- organised defences.                       ^.   Moreover  in   a  small   voluntarily-enlisted  army   like  ourtwn  they  constitute  an  essential  compensation  for   lack.. of numbers  which  it  would   be  impossible  to surrender.    As faras this country  is  concerned, in  view of  its world-wide  responsi-hilities, any general  prohibition would require  an increase in oiirpresent land forces In terms of man power, and  thus, as a measureof disarmament, would tend to defeat its own ends.  But, as I havealready said, we are in entire agreement with President Hoover as,&apos;tythe principle which he  seeks  to apply  to the subject of tanks.     ,   ii.  It  would  be  seen,  therefore,  that  in  the realm  of landdisarmament the proposals  of  the United  States  Government, so..faras they relate to matters which  directly touch the land forces of,theUnited-Kingdom,  approximate very closely to those favoured by, HisMajesty &apos;s Government;  and, that in  the  total of their effective? j H,isMiijesty&apos;s Government have been able already to put  into, practice,.?measure  of disarmament which more than conforms to the  standardproposed by President Hoover.                        Naval  Proposals.                    ,&quot;&quot;&apos;   7.  These proposals cover all  types of vessel capital ships, aircraftraniers,  cruisers,-destroyers and submarines.                  &apos; ..n:)   It is  essential that proposals that are. intended to  be adopted, jbygeneral  agreement   should  make   due  provision   for   varyingcircumstances.  Having regard to the widely-scattered.responsibilities of the British Navy, it is not practicable for us to cut down the numberof naval units beyond a certain point.   Occasions may arise,-when these responsibilities  call for  the  presence of. ships  simultaneously in parts  of the world  far removed from one another.  It is essentialto bear in  mind in. this connection  the  very large reduction in .thenumber  of  ships  of all categories which  has already been effected.If a comparison is made with the year before the  War it will befoupdthat, taking account of completed vessels of the United Kingdom andother members of the  British Commonwealth possessing vessels,,of.anyof the categories mentioned,  capital ships have been reduced,fifomtii) to 15 ;  cruisers from 108 to 52:  destroyers from 285 to .147; and submarines  from 74  to. 52.   But, though there.as, for  the reasonsalready pointed  out,  a  limit  to numerical.reduction, it. is; perfefitly
 pb&amp;ible,bltfM  in^the&apos; &quot;HMesf1 d^relj^kirabti,1 !to adopt1,a&apos;mode of  rfedmirin^hito                                                u, navaT;ia^m3n^                            TlMfygSnf TrW^ Uikits,:of (siz&apos;e an&apos;d ^uii ealib Government consider  that very large reductions, amounting to about about one-third in the ease both of capital ships and cruisers, can he made in future construction.    8.  As regards capital ships, the  position under the existing Naval treaties is  that as between Britain, the United&apos; States  and Japan, however, no further capital ship construction can be undertaken until the year 1987. The maximum size  for future construction has been fixed at 85,000 tons and the gun at  16 inches.  The total tonnage of the category of ships can  be reduced  either by  diminishing their size.   In regard  to  the number,  consideration  which  the  United Kingdom Government are bound to  bear in mind have already been stated.   The  American  proposal  would  leave  the  size of  these onormously expensive vessels,  and the calibre of their guns untouched in any future construction of capital ships.  Every figure involved ia these huge dimensions initial cost,  upkeep, personnel, ammunition, stores, docks would be maintained at the highest level.  The United Kingdom proposal,  while securing no less reduction in total tonnage, evades.these  consequences by (1)  reducing the  size of  the  gun: (2) reducing the size of the ship.  ,,..Por example, if the calibre of the gun is reduced to 12 inches the maximum size of the ship can  be reduced from 35,000 to 25,000 tons, and an immense saving is effected under both heads, both initially and consequentially.    9.  But  the Government of the  United Kingdom are  prepared lo go beyond this.   They are ready to apply  the  same principles to cruisers,  and to reduce their maximum size and gun-calibre by inter- national agreement from the present figure of 10,000 tons and S inches to 7,000 tons and 6 1 inches.  It would then be possible to reduce the dimensions in the case of capital ships still further and fix  a maximum of 22,000 tons with  11-inch. guns.  This will nearly halve the initial cost of any future capital ship and  greatly reduce the cost of maintenance. Thus the whole scale would come down together and there would be :i definite return to  smaller  dimensions.   On this basis  the  United Kingdom proposal would effect an ultimate reduction in  capital-ship tonnage  alone  of  195,000  tons;  the comparable figure under  tin- United States proposal would appear  to be about 175,000.   TrlO.  As regards aircraft carriers, the Government of the United Kingdom are in substantial agreement with President Hoover&apos;s pro-^ pbsals.  They propose a reduction in the size of the Aircraft Carrier from 27,000 to 22,000 tons, with consequent reduction in total tonnage from 135,000 to 110,000 tons.    11.  Special reference  must  be   made  to the  Submarine.   The U/nited Kingdom view has been, and is, that the submarine should be

Consequently, the Government of the United Kingdom  putt?forward for  immediate  adoption  by international  agreement   thefollowing set of proposals  relating to the navies of the world :   .  :\   (1) Reduce the maximum size of any future capital ship to 22,000         tons,  and the maximum calibre  of  the  guns  carried  to         11  inches.                        .                   :   (2) Reduce the maximum size  of cruisers hereafter constructed tiy         7,000  tons, and maximum calibre of guns to (i&apos;l inches.  :   01) If international agreement on point (2) cannot be secured, the1         Government of the United Kingdom  would still  urge  that&apos;         the maximum  size  of capital  ships should  be reduced  to         25,000 tons and their guns to 12 inches as a maximum. :   (4) Reduce the  maxima for aircraft carriers to 22,000  tons  with         6&quot;l-inch guns.                                       --.\&apos;-r-   (5) Abolish submarines. .                                    ;!r   ill) Reduce destroyer tonnage  by  approximately one-third,  this&quot;         depending on the abolition of submarines.   (7) If  submarines cannot  be  completely  abolished,  fix  their         maximum surface displacement at 250 tons,  with a strict&apos;         limitation both of total tonnage and number of units.                        air  PROPOSALS.   13.  There is no aspect of international disarmament more vitally.urgent than the  adoption without delay of the most effective measure;?!to  preserve  the civilian population  from  the  fearful horrors.; of bombardment from  the air.  The Government of the United kingdom would be  prepared to go. to  any  length, in agreement with other,Powers, to achieve  this  object, and if  more  drastic measures  are,proposed from any other quarter and are shown to be practicable;  theyiwill examine them with the utmost sympathy..                      .1.   They propose that the  High  Contracting  Parties   should agreesbetween themselves in respect of their air forces that there should be-\   (1) the complete prohibition of  all bombing from  the air,  save         within limits to be laid down as precisely as possible by an         international convention.  Attacks  upon the civilian popular 1         tion would be entirely prohibited :                    - &amp;  sq   (2) a strict limitation in the  unladen weight of all  military and-         naval  aircraft  (troop carriers and flying boats excepted) jnc/si   (3) a restriction in the numbers of all kinds of military and naval         aircraft.                          &apos;&apos;&quot;

Her colonial possessions are  widely scattered,and since the War her responsibilities  have been increased by hervarious  mandates from the League of Nations.  More than any otherPower she relies  upon aircraft to discharge her mandatory duties andto police and control undeveloped regions.  Yet in 1932 her first line aircraft had been reduced to little more than 20 per cent, of her [wst-war strength, with the result that the United Kingdom now stands, inthe number of its military and naval aeroplanes, only fifth in the list of states.  Of aircraft authorised for Home Defence in 1928 by the UnitedKingdom  Government, with the approval of Parliament. 20 per cent.have not,  in fact, been constructed.   15.

The  proposals which,accordingly,  are now  made, constitute an  additional  contribution,practical  and extensive,  to  the effort  to relieve the heavy burdenswhich the maintenance of existing standards imposes upon the world and which the world expects us, by a great common effect, effectivehto diminish.

n n3rd Paragraph of Sub-Paragraph (d)  omit thefollowing sentence&apos; :-   &quot;But as a means of saving the life of the    soldiers, as well as of economising man-    power, tanks are invaluable &quot; And begin.     the next sentence with  the  word    &quot;Moreover.&quot; Add at the end of the 3rd Paragraph of Sub- Paragraph (d) the following sentence:    &quot;But, as I have already said, we are in     entire agreement with President Hoover as to     the    principle   which he seeks to apply     to the subject of tanks.&quot; Paragraph 6 as renumbered (  old paragraph 12) line  4  delete the words :    &quot;and  of the countries of the British    Commonwealth.&quot;  Paragraphs numbered 4-9 respectively to  be remumbered 7-12 inclusive.  Line 6  of Paragraph 7 as (renumbered) delete  the following phrase:     &quot;and to the conjoint interest  of the     members of the British Commonwealth&quot;  Line 8  after the words:     &quot;beyond a certain point&quot;  Insert  the following:     &quot;Occasions may arise when these responsibilities      call for the presence of ships;simultaneously-      eously in parts of the world  far  removed      from one another,    It  is essential to      bear in mind in this connection the very      large reduction in the number of  ships      of  all categories  which  has already been      effected.    If a comparison is made with    *      the year before the  war,  it will  be found      that;taking  account  of  completed  vessels      of  the United Kingdom and other members ef      the British  Commonwealth possessing vessels       of any of the  categories mentioned,       capital ships  have  been reduced  from       69 -  15;  cruisers from  108 - 52;  destroyers       from 285 -  147;  and submarines from 74 - 52.&quot;
     The beginning of the next sentence is     amended by a small addition to read as follows:-        &quot;But, though there is, for the reasons         already pointed out, a limit to          numerical reduction, it is perfectly          possible,.......&quot;(7),,  In Paragraph 8(as renumbered)the first     and second sentences have been transposed,     without any alteration in wording however.     The following sentence has been omitted.         &quot;The proportions of such ships as         between these three Powers is in the         ratio of 15; 15; 9.&quot;      Line 8 of Paragraph 8 the following      addition is made;   after the words s-    &quot;diminishing their size.&quot;  Add:     &quot;In regard to  number,  the  considerations     which the  United Kingdom Government  are     bound to bear  in amount  have already been     stated,&quot;The next sentences which reads as follows:   &quot;The American proposal  is for a  reduction     in  number,  namely, from  15 capital     ships to 10; it  would  then leave the     size of these  enormously expensive  vessels     untouched,,   Not only  so,  but guns of 16-inch         calibre would  remain in any future     construction of  capital  ships.&quot;     Has been amended to read as  follows:         &quot;The American proposal would leave  the         size of these enormously expensive         vessels,  and the calibre of their guns,         untouched in any future  construction         of capital ships.&quot;(8).  Paragraph 12(as rehumbere  ^transpose Sub-Para.     (6)  and (7)  and reletter them accordingly.
Paragraph 13., Sub-paragraph (1),    For &quot;the complete prohibition of all bombing from the    air save within limits to be  laid down by an.International    Convention.   Attacks upon civilian population would    be prohibited.   The Convention would define as precisely    as possible the limits of permissible military objectives,Read:    &quot;the complete prohibition of  all bombing from the air,    save within limits to be laid down as precisely as    possible by an International  Convention.   Attacks upon the    civilian population would be  entirely prohibited.&quot;10)  Paragraph 14 which read as follows:        &quot;It is essential to bear In mind the extent of British        disarmament effected both on sea and by measures,  addi-        tional to the abolition of conscription, on land.    If        a comparison is nia.de with the year before the War, It        will be found that in complete vessels the capital ships        of the members of the British Commonwealth have been        reduced from 69 to 15, its cruisers from 103 to 52, its        destroyers from 2S5 to 1-17, and its submarines from 74        to 52.          The personnel of the British Army, including its eon-        contingents in India, has been reduced in the same period        from 259,000 to 207,000 and this has been effected by        the disbandment of 9 regiments cf cavalry, 61 batteries        and companies of artillery, 21 companies of Royal  Engi-        neers, 21 battalions of infantry, and 6 battalions of        colonial and troops locally enrolled.  (In addition, there        has been during the same period a net reduction of the        personnel of the Indian Army of approximately 20,000 men.)           The air ami was in its infancy in 1913-1914, and no        comparison can be made with that date, but it must be        mentioned that in the number of military and naval        aeroplanes the United Kingdom stands only fIf tK \&amp;ri? -the list        of States and that, of aircraft authorised for Home        Defence in 1923 by the United Kingdom Government with the        approval of Parliament, 20 per*cer!t. have not, in fact,        been constructed.&quot;    Has been entirely re-cast and now reads as follows:        &quot;In this last connection the United Kingdom Government        -wish to add an observation.   They sincerely desire to        see numbers of military and naval aircraft  restricted,        and here again regard must be had to the course of        recent events.   in 1913-14 air armaments were negligible        and no comparison with that date can usefully be made.        At the end of the War, Great Britain was one of the two        leading Air Powers .of the world.   Her colonial possessions        are widely scattered,  and since the War her responsibilities -        ties have been increased by her various mandates from the        League of nations.   More than any other Power she relies        upon air craft to discharge her mandatory duties
         and to  police-and  control  undeveloped  regions.         Yet in  1932 her  first  line  aircraft, had  been reduced         to  little more than 20 per  cent,  of her pre-war         strength, with the  result that  the United Kingdom now         stands,in the  number of Its military and  naval aeroplanes,         only fifth  in  the list of States.  &quot; Of  aircraft  autho-         rised for Home Defence in 1923  by the United  Kingdom         Government  with  the approval  of Parliament, 20 per  cent.         have not in fact been  constructed.&quot;        (Note the substance  of  the first two Sub-paragraphs         of  this paragraph 14 have been  included under Land  and         Naval Proposals  respectively.)(11)  Paragraph 15.         The following  addition should be made to  the  first  line,         after, thev.-words:             &quot;these  reductions  &quot;         Insert;             &quot;In all three armies&quot;         Line 5, Paragraph 15,  delete  brackets outside the         words;             &quot;Outside the countries  disarmed by  the Treaty of             Versailles.&quot;(12)      The Table of Naval Tonnage Reductions included at the         end has been deleted.
