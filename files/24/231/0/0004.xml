(THIS  DOCUMENT IG THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; B government&amp;IBiHT)THE SITUATION IN REGARD TO THE IRAQ LEVIES.  Memorandum &quot;by the Colonial Office (circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies).Iraq, telegraphed to the Chief of Air Staff reporting thatthe native officers of the Assyrian Levies had sent in amanifesto stating that, as the British Government hadnot safeguarded the interests of the Assyrian Nation,the whole Force would disband itself at the end of June.2.      The Assyrian Levies are a force, consisting of two battalions, which is paid for from Imperial funds and provides the main protection for our aerodromes in Iraq.The intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government was that some1200 of them should be retained after Iraq&apos;s admission to the League to constitute aerodrome guards, theremainder being disbanded between now and September. ,  Thecharge that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not safeguardedthe interests of the Assyrian Nation is inspired by the impending termination of the British mandate.    agitation against the termination of the mandate having failed of its purpose, the Assyrian Patriarch, Mar Shimun, (a youth ofsome 21 years of age,)  appealed to the League of Nations toestablish an Assyrian autonomous enclave under the  auspicesSECRET.CP.  204 (-52).COPY NO.C A B I N E T.1.On the 2nd of June the Air Officer Commanding
 of  the League.   This petition was rejected by the League Council on the recommendation of the Mandates Commission;   whereupon the Assyrian Patriarch announced that he and all his people intended to emigrate en masse to Syria.   Incidentally, it is most unlikely that the French would permit a wholesale immigration of Assyrians into Syria, and even if permission were forthcoming, the Mar Shimun would, it is thought,  find only a small number of his co-religionists ready to accompany him.    Lately, indeed, there have been indications that he was reconsidering his scheme for emigration, and only last  month it v/as reported that indirect negotiations between him and the Iraqi Government?aad been opened to  settle  conditions  under which the assyrians should remain in Iraq. 3.       On receipt  of the  manifesto from the Assyrian officers of the Levies, the Air Officer Commanding decided himself to  take the initiative of disbanding the Force, retaining only  such members as repudiated the manifesto.    It was thought possible that this drastic action would bring a large proportion of theForce to their senses, and that the whole subversive movement might possibly fizzle out.    He reported  that he was making arrangements to begin the disbandment in the third week of June and to complete it by the end of the month. 4.      On receipt  of the  Air Officer Commanding&apos;s telegram, a telegram was sent to the High Commissioner, who was just about  to proceed on leave, asking
for his views on the situation and his recommendations for dealing with it.    Sir P.  Humphryshad, however, already left for Palestine and the telegram missed him.    V/hen this was known, a telegramv/as sent to Sir P.  Humphrys in Jerusalem asking himwhether he was satisfied that the Levy situation could safely be left,  and the Air Officer Commanding,  whowas acting as High Commissioner, was asked to repeat the relevant telegrams to Jerusalem for Sir P.  Humphrys&apos;information.   In the meantime the Acting HighCommissioner telegraphed that the movement in the levies seemed part of a desperate plan to reunitethe Assyrian Nation and that the ultimate aim was almost certainly national migration.    On the 7th ofJune he telegraphed again to say that the whole situation was rather easier.   He added that the assyrian Patriarch had called a meeting of tribaland religious leaders for the 15th June in order tomake some form of announcement.5.     Sir P. Humphrys returned to Baghdad on the 7thJune.    On the 11th June the Chief of Air Staff received an urgent  telegram from the Air Officer Commanding  (copy attached -enclosure I  ) reporting that  both he and the High Commissioner  considered that  the Assyrian Levies were  serious in their intention of disbanding  and that onee disbanded
they must be prevented from joining the threatenedconcentration of the Assyrians in the north.    Forthis purpose, he asked for reinforcements consistingof one British Battalion and an Armoured CarSection.   On receipt of this telegram the AirMinistry immediately got in touch with the GeneralStaff and warned them that a Battalion mighthave to be despatched to Iraq by air at shortnoticei  they also communicated with the ColonialOffice.6.   Shortly after a telegram (copy attached,enclosure II) was received from the HighCommissioner,   This telegram, while not specificallyendorsing the request for reinforcements,emphasised the critical nature of the situationand the serious intention that might be underlying the Mar Shimun&apos;s project to convoke a nationalmeeting of Assyrians at Amadia on 15th June.(Amadia is on the northern frontier of IraqiKurdistan, some distance to the west of the scene of the present operations against the Sheikh ofBarzsin).   Sir F. Humphrys reported that he istrying to p.r.&quot; -*nge a meeting with the Assyrianleaders on Monday the 13th June to discuss the situation
and added that the possibility of delaying the disbandment of the Levies was being examined.7.   It was clear from thes^ two telegrams that the re-inforcements asked for were required, not to undertake theactual disbandment of the Levy Force, which the Air OfficerCommanding felt capable of carrying out with the forces athis disposal, but to prevent the Levies, once disbanded anddisarmed, from going north to join their compatriots.8.  On receipt of the High Commissioners telegram theChief of the Imperial General Staff was consulted,but stated he felt unable to recommend the despatchof any reinforcements to Iraq, owing to the r educedforces at his disposal and would require a definiteinstruction from the Cabinet.   The Air Staff estimated,however, that it would be necessary for the transport oftroops by aircraft to start on Tuesday morning the 14thJune, if two Companies were to be delivered at Baghdad bythe 18th June, the date stipulated by the Air OfficerCommanding.     On the evening of the 11th June the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies authorised the despatch of a telegram to theHigh Commissioner: (copy attached, enclosure III),instructing h-5T to report immediately by telegram the outcome of his interview with the Assyrian leaders, andpointing out the deplorable political effect at Geneva and elsewhere of sending British troops to Iraq at this juncture.     I his telegram crossed a further telegram from the HighCommissioner:  (copy attached, enclosure IV).   From this
telegram it is clear that (i) the Assyrian Levies are  notbluffing and are determined to cease serving at the end ofthe month (ii) an extremely serious situation might arise if, on disbandment, they were allowed to join the concentration of Assyrians in the North, and (iii) inthe opinion of the Air Officer Commanding, this cannotbeprevented unless his forces are reinforced by a British battalion and an Armoured   Car Section.Colonial Office.    12th June, 1932.

CYPHER TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner of Iraq.to the Secretary  of State for the Colonies.Dated 11th June.   Received Colonial Office10.19 a,p.o 11th JuneHo. 198,      My telegram Ho.  195.   Situation is breifly as follows,   Assyrian Leader(s)  holding Conference        at15th June/Amadia to decide action to he (? wordomitted) in view of impending termination of british mandate over Iraq,   Their decision will probablybe communicated to me a few days  later.   Meanwhiletheir plan is reported to be to make call to thewhole Nation including Levy officers and men toprepare  to concentrate in Amadia area to giveunited support to policy adopted by Leaders.   ^that.this policy may be is not yet known and probably notdecided but it seems possible that, once concentratedAssyrians may try to enforce attention to their demands and even to create National Enclave inNorthern Iraq by a coup do main.    I am invitingLeaders to meet me on 15th June to discuss situation with them,,   Air Officer Commanding has preparedplan for disbandment of Levies and hopes to be ableto disarm them without incident.    I consider that steps should be taken to prevent  disbanded men from joining threatened concentration  in the North butthe Air Officer Commanding tells  me that he cannot
ensure this without reinforcements,,    I  have  in-formed the Iraq Government of position.    Kingwhile personally &quot;believing Assyrians  to  be &quot;bluffingexpressed grave anxiety as to the possibility of conflict with Kurds if Assyrians concentrated inthe hills especially in view of  the  fact  that  thebulk of Iraqi Army engaged in Barzan  operationsthus leaving the Government without adequate  force to deal with eventualities.   For this reason hesaid that he hoped that disbandment of Levies wouldbe postponed as long as possible in order  that  there might be some hope of finishing B.arzan operationsbefore Assyrian concentration began,   This questionis being examined.   There are about  600 Assyriansin Iraq Police and 100 in the Army.    It is reportedthat attempts are being made by Assyrian leaders to persuade them to desertD   I have  sent  despatchby  air mail leaving this morning and will telegraphresult of meeting with the Leaders.
ENCLOSURE III.Cypher telegram from the Secretary of State forthe Colcnies to the High Commissioner for IraqT&quot;       I M M EDI A T Eo     No. 149.  Your telegram No. 196.   I have seentelegram No. Z 269 from Air Officer Commanding toChief of Air Staff stating that reinforcements ofone British Battalion and. one section Armoured Gars&quot;will he required as a minimum to prevent disbandedLevies joining Assyrian concentration in the north.     No definite decision as te despatch of British reinforcements can be reached here before nextMonday 13th June at earliest0    Even if H. Mo G. sanctiondespatch of reinforcements ne movement order will issue until your report on outcome ef your meeting with Assyrian leaders on 13th June is received.     Yeu should telegraph immediately after yourdiscussion with leaders as to the position and whether you still consider despatch of British troopsindispensable.      While circumstances may9 of coursesnecessitate reinforcements by British tz^oopss you will appreciate deplorable political effect this wouldhave  at Geneva and elsewhere and the possible seriousreactions on prospects of Iraq&apos;s admission to theLeague next September.   Prom that point of view9apart from any other considerationss I shall be extremely relieved if this step can be avoided.     While I realise that in view of ultimatumpresented to Levy leaders (see A.O.C. &apos; s telegram No.2  248 of 2nd June) initial stages of disbandment                 -  /   10.  -
cannot be postponed, would it not be possible to delay later stages in order to give opportunity forv/iser counsels to prevail?   I presume that for purpose of your meeting with leaders on 13th Juneyou will endeavcur to obtain Iraqi Government&apos;acceptance of such of the conditions mentioned in thesecond enclosure to your confidential despatch of14th May as you consider reasonable and justified.11 o
                                                      onCypher telegram from the High Commissioner forIi*aq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 11th June:   Received Colonial Office             1 army  12th June,No. 1991    Reply urgently required,,      My 198,.   I held conference at Residency this morning with Air Officer Commanding which was attended by Brigadier Browne Commanding Iraq Levies Air Commander Courtney (?and) Squadron Leader Reed.    Latter has many years intimate knowledge orthodox Asayrians0    Browne and Reed have just returned from visit to Levies at Sulimaniyah and Diana.      They are convinced that the Levies are determined to stop serving at the end of the month, are not bluffing and that nothing will move them from their intention.    Postponement of disbandment therefore seems impracticable.      Air Officer Commanding and I both (? consider) it is (?essential) to take steps to prevent Levies frcm joining proposed concentration in Dohuk Amadia District,,    Concentration will in any event present serious problem (? but) its dangerous potentialities will be much diminished if 1500 levy men  (?&apos; are prevented) front joining it. Moreover  if levies aro disbanded and men permitted to  join Assyrian concentration hostile to Iraq Government  it will be difficult to dispel general impression  that H.M,G0 are conniving at Assyrian
challenge.   Air Officer Commanding expects to be ableto disarm and disband Levies without trouble.   But inorder to confine them after disarmament to their presentstations Air Officer Commanding considers that he wouldrequire minimum reinforcements of 1 Battalion british infantry and 1 section Armoured Cars.   My own view, inwhich Air Officer Commanding and Cornwallis concur, isthat if concentration in accordance with what is believed tobe plan of Assyrian leaders is permitted to take placethere will be gravest danger of clash between Assyrians andKurds from which situation could rapidly develop whichmight destroy whole ?rork of British policy during past ten years,   King and Iraq.  Government are also mostapprehensive of future developments.   If however Levies                                     ?       ?are prevented from dispensing I am hopeful plan  of concentration may break down and that Assyrians may bedissuaded from adopting extreme measures to which they now seem determined to have recourse to.     I accordingly urge that proposal to disarm and place Levies under restraint should be ?(approved?) andthat agreement of H.M.G. should be obtained to the des-patch of reinforcements which Air Officer Commanding re-quires to enable him to carry out this plan.     As reported in my  198  I am interviewing leaderson 13th June.   Those in closest touch with Assyrianswarn us however that leaders
 swore secret pacts several weeks ago and are too far committed to be influenced by anyarguments which I may use.   &quot;While I shall do myutmost to make them see reason I feel that theyare unlikely to abandon their present coerciveplan (?) until they have tried and failed.
