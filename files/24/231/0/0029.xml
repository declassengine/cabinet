ANNEX I201In continuation of the Report dated June  21st  we would          isummarize the results of the third and fourth  days&apos; meetings with the French and American Delegates at Geneva,  on June22nd and 23rd.   As a consequence of the Hoover Declaration  we  agreedthat we could not well discuss at this moment  specificquestions of land and sea disarmament.   It was necessary  toallow a few days&apos; interval during which the large  issueraised could he considered by the British and  french governments.   We turned therefore to the question of budgetary Limitation.   The British Delegation opened the discussion &quot;by sayingthat we were not opposed to such limitation in principle,but that we thought it impossible to take present  expenditure as a datum line, and  to make a cut in that, unless accountwere taken of the fact that some countries had reduced their expenditure already.   The cost of the British defence services, calculated  on the basis proposed by the  budgetaryexperts, had been reduced in the last seven years  by nearly20 per cent., while the expenditure of others  had  been increased.   Ought we therefore to be asked to make a  secondcut, when other nations would be making only one?   MonsieurPaul-Boncour at once  said that he accepted entirely the justice of this contention.   The American Delegation  alsoconcurred.   The Americans then advanced this point.  For  a numberof years after the war they had undertaken no  naval ship-building.   They had  then decided to do so, and the washington and London Treaties had authorised them to construct a
certain tonnage.   That having &quot;been done  by one  inter-national agreement, it was not reasonable for anotherinternational agreement to impose financial restrictions which would prevent the cost of that construction beingmet.   The work was distributed over a series of years,and was now proceeding.   It v/ould, however, soon be com-pleted.   Meanwhile there could not be a  percentage  cut  in that expenditure.   The French Delegation referred to a considerationaffecting them v/hich, they said, was to some extentanalogous.   They v/ere engaged in a scheme of fortificationson their frontier which entailed a considerable  expenditure over a limited number of years.   When these fortificationshad been erected that expenditure would cease.   But if  itwere brought into  their total figures it  would swell themunduly.   Monsieur Paul-Boncour volunteered the opinionalso that it v/ould raise the French total of permissibleexpenditure at  the end of the period to a higher figure  than would be right.   The question of the alternatives of global limitation,or of limitation of the expenditure of each of the three services separately,was discussed.   The  balance of  argumentappeared to be decidedly in favour of taking the expendituresas a whole.   In the first place, there would in any case be difficulty in determining what are the methods ofaccounting on v/hich the actual expenditures of different countries could be determined on comparable lines;  butthis difficulty v/ould be enormously increased if each country&apos;s expenditure on land, sea and air services  had  to
                                                            k U l)be separated out.   The degree of oonnecticn between any two or all three of those services in the various countriesdiffered enormously.   If this were insisted upon,  it mightwell be found that the Budgetary Expert Committee had beengiven an impossible task, and that it would be equivalent tovetoing Budgetary Limitation altogether.     Secondly5 in our own particular case it might prove veryinconvenient in practice if separate limitations of expenditure were imposed on each of the three services.    On various headsof expenditure the present figures are considered to be too lowfor efficiency; we have to look to the economies which theDisarmament Convention would allow, or indeed require, under other heads to give the possibility of funds being availableto make good those deficiencies; if each service were in aseparate compartment it would prevent the best use being madeof whatever sums might be forthcoming.     The discussion, which covered certain other points also,was adjourned till the following day, and in the interval weprepared the following memorandum which was circulated atthe next meeting.                     Budgetary Limitation.(These suggestions are made for purposes of discussion.   Theyhave not yet been considered by the British Government.)1.   The limitation shall be based upon figures of expendituredetermined according -to the rules that are now being framed bythe Budgetary Committee of the Preparatory Commission.                       -3-
2.   It shall apply tc army,  navy and air expenditure as a whole.3.   It shall apply to the figures of expenditure of thepresent year.4.   It shall take the form of a reduction of a specifiedpercentage from that expenditure, the percentage figure tohe fixed at a later stage, when the various reductions of  arma-ments to he effected by the Convention can be envisaged asa whole.5.   Any nation v/hich can show to the satisfaction of  thePermament Disarmament Commission that it has already,  withinthe last five years,&quot; effected a reduction in its expenditureupon armaments, shall be entitled to count such reductiontowards the required percentage.6.   Any expenditure upon naval construction and maintenanceauthorised by the Treaties of V/ashington and London shallnot be subject to the required reduction.7.   Expenditure upon permament fortifications ( not includ-ing their artillery) shall not be subject to the reduction,and such expenditure shall be deducted for all purposes fromthe figures specified in paragraph 1.8.   A provision shall be included to  cover unforeseenemergencies in the form proposed by Article 50 of the  DraftConvention.9.   A provision shall be included to meet the contingency of large changes in prices due to fluctuations in the purchasing power of money, as proposed by the BudgetaryCommittee.
      (it  is  a  matter for  consideration whether5 and in what forms  the provisions of Article 10 of the Draft Conventions which  relates  to  a  special reduction in expenditure upon land material^  should he  embodied in these proposals).     The British Delegation drew particular attention to the reservation prefixed  to the memorandum.  The Americans said that their Government had misgivings about budgetary limitation but were prepared to give it further consideration.The French delegates accepted the whole document in principles and all the points in detail except (5) and (6)  to which theywould like to give &quot;further study 0  But this v/as not to saythat they would be likely to object to them.  The Americansadded that they would like time to consider the wording ofpoint(5) ,,and the problems raised by point(9) . It v/as fully understood that the memorandum v/as of a tentative character and did not purport to deal with precision with the various points.     Lastlys the discussions turned to the question of control by the Permanent Disarmament Commission - Part VI of theDraft Convention.  Here the first point raised v/as whetherthe proposed Commission should be entrusted with the duty of preparing for the next Disarmament Conferences in much the same way that the Preparatory Commission had prepared forthis one.   The French and Americans thought that it shouldbe:  it was essential to have some organ for this work; it  ;  .v/ould give the Permanent Commission a larger scope and would attract a better membership;  it v/ould save the commission from being restricted to tasks of an inquisitorial nature;
 it v/ould avoid a multiplication of organisations.  On the other hand9 we pointed out these considerations:- the Permanent Commission was to have a quasi-judicial character; and its members were to sit not as representatives of their governments; hut this proposal v/ould involve it in matters of controversy.  Further, the number of States with members on the Commission was to be small, but the others would resent being excluded from the work of preparation for the next Conference.,  There was general agreement between the three Delegations that the Conventionought to include articles providing for the establishment of an organ which should prepare &quot;in advance the work of thenext Conference;  but the character of that body was reserved for further consideration, two  alternatives having beenunder discussion:-     (a) the employment of the  Permanent Disarmament            Commission for the  purpose,     (b) the constitution of a body composed of the Councilof the League (which would include the elected representativesof the smaller States) - as contemplated by Article 8 of the Covenant of the League, together with representatives of the States not members of the League participating in this Conference.  This body would keep in close touch with the Permament Disarmament Commission and would have the benefit of its experience as to the working of the Convention during the intervals     The only other point raised in relation to control was whether any form of local inspection should be authorised. The French urged that it was essential that, if one country
 entered a complaint against another that some provision of the  Convention was being broken, the Permanent Disarmament Commission  should have the right, if it thought there was substance in the complaint, to set on foot an investigation of its own  to ascertain whether it was well-founded or  not. We pointed  to the possibility that an ill-founded complaint might be made, precisely in order to secure  that a local inquiry should be held, the real purpose of which might be to obtain information about some quite different matter. To this the French replied, first, that it would be within the  discretion of the Permament Commission either to under- take an investigation or not, and that such bodies had proved themselves hitherto rather over-cautious in taking action than the reverse; and, secondly, that even if therewere a remote danger of possible occasional abuse, thedanger was  far greater that some country might be making secret preparations for war, involving breaches of specificprovisions  of the Convention, and that no impartial authority would have  any.right to see whether that was so or not. This would  shake confidence in the whole structure of international disarmament.   As the outcome of the discussion the  French  undertook to prepare a draft of a provision which would give  substantial effect to the aim in view without arousing too strong an opposition.     The conversations have continued to be throughout of a most frank  and friendly character.     We would add incidentally that the American Delegation hove made it plain that they regard the Hoover proposals as                             7.
                                                          2.0the goal at which we should aim;   they were not to beconsidered in the light of an ultimatum.   If they could notbe accepted as a whole the American Government would be glad to co-operate in something less.   But the naval reductionssuggested were dependent upon the adherence of France andItaly of the London Treaty,   The Americans quite agreed thatin these conversations it would not be wise to undertake theconsideration of the Hoover proposals forthwith;  on theother hand they would like them to be considered without too long a delay.                                (Int)    L.                                         H.S.Geneva,      24th June, 1932,
