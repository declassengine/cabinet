19MHIS DOCUMENT IS THE HI OPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)    SECRET.                                          COPY NO.^C.P.202(32).                       CABINET.                            INDIA.                 CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT.       Memorandum by the Secretary  of  State for India.             In continuation of C.P.184(32), I circulate for  the    information of my colleagues a  copy of a telegram from the    Government of India dated 4th June,  and of the  reply which I sent    them on the 10th June.   In this telegram,the  Government of India,    after having consulted  the local Governments, put forward    their final proposals for action necessary to deal  with the    Civil Disobedience Movement when the present  Ordinances expire    on the 3rd July.  The circular  letter sent by the Government of    India to all local  Governments  on  this subject and  a summary of    the views of the local  Governments sent in reply was contained  in    CP.184(32).  The Government of India are satisfied that  the    situation at the end of June will  be such as  to require emergency    powers.  They therefore propose to issue one  consolidated    Ordinance which will contain most  of the special powers now    conferred by the existing Ordinances.  This Ordinance will be    issued a few days before the present Ordinances expire in order    that  the powers may be  continued without a break. Although the    new Ordinance will  contain all  these powers,  their  application to    the various Provinces will be restricted as far as  possible,    and the Provinces themselves will  apply them  only to those    districts where they are necessary.             As will be seen, the Government of India do not  contemplate    the possibility of any  subsequent  extension of  the  Ordinances and    intend that, if any powers not  now provided by  the  ordinary law  are    required at the end of  the year, legislation  will be introduced.             With the concur-rehce7 of &apos; the-Cabinet  India  Committee, I    have  telegraphed my approval to the  Government  of India&apos;s proposals.                                    S.H.    13th June 1932.
Telegram from Government of India, Home Department,  to   Secretary of State for India, dated 4th June 1932.I334.    Reference renewal of oowers contained in OrdinancesNos.ii, iii, iv and v of 1932, you have received copy of ourletter dated 20th April to Local Governments and copies oftheir replies.  These state main issues.         2. is regards the necessity of powers, local Govern-rnents are unanimous that, so far as they can foresee, thesituation at the end of June will be such as to requireemergency powers. We entirely agree with this view. the tentative appreciation of the position contained in paragraph 8of our express letter of 7th March 1932 for the purpose ofreference to the Law Officers of the Grown may now be confirmedsubject to the following amplification.  Present efforts of congress are mainly directed towards following objects:-Firsts intensive boycotting of British goods;  second, to keepalive and, if possible, increase enthusiasm by demonstrations.Instances of this are. Congress session at Delhi and currentattempts to hold provincial Congress sessions to confirmresolutions then passed.  Third, to extend agitation in rural areas.  Propaganda by seditious leaflets has been feature of thmovement in several provinces during the past few weeks;fourth, dislocation of Government activities.  There has beendefinite tendency recently towards malicious damage ofgovernment property, for instance, telegraph wires and postoffice boxes.      The limited success attained by these efforts has undoubtedly been due to the measures local governments have been able to take against them.  Governmentobtained the initiative early in January and have retained itever since, and they are therefore able to prevent and, in somecases, to anticipate Congress plans.                                                     Their
         Their ability to do so would be gravely prejudiced ifthere were any surrender of the necessary powers.  local governments lay great emphasis on this and we are ourselvesconvinced that, in spite of the present control over themovement, there would bs serious recrudescence of trouble if themeasures were relaxed.  Our information is that Congress werecounting on lapse of Ordinances for big renewal of effort.Further consideration, is that the majority of sentencesinflicted are imprisonment of six months. From the beginning ofJuly there will therefore be big efflux of prisoners and while we doubt whether many will renew activities if we have powers todeal with them, we believe that many would renew agitation ifthere were any relaxation.         We are, therefore, completely satisfied that powers should be renewed.         3. Local Governments generally support schemecontained in paragraph 4 of our letter of 20th April and we propose to adopt it.         4. As regards scope of the powers, it is clear thatthe requirements will vary greatly from province to provinceand that there will be considerable opportunity of restrictingapplication of powers to particular provinces and of restrictingareas withinprovince in which powers that are extended willbe operative.  On the other hand, general scheme of the ordinance makes it necessary to include in it all powers thatare required in any province.  This fact very greatly reduces the scope for abandonment of existing powers.  For instance inparagraph 7 of our letter of 20th April we suggested possibilityof dropping powers of the Unlawful Instigation Ordinance if conditions in the United Provinces so permitted.  It is clear                                                     that
that conditions will not p rait and that therefore these powers must be retained. Similarly for most of the other pov/ers.Our provisional examination definitely indicates that we shallbe able to abandon a few pov/ers only, to which little resorthas been made.  Our general view on this matter is that while we should dispense with powers which are clearly not necessary,we should retain all pwers which the situation requires.  3yabandoning a power here and there we shall not appreciablymitigate criticism of our general policy, while if we abandonany necessary powers we shall prejudice our means of dealingwith the movement, In this connection, observations contained  inparagraph 4 of Bengal Government&apos;s letter are pertinent.         On the other hand, we do not at present contemplateaddition of any new powers, save of a minor character.Some small additions may be necessary to cover the lacunaewhich experience has shown exist and a few draft changes may bedesirable.  We have the contents of Ordinance now under examination and will communicate them to you at early date.         5- As regards  extention of particular chapters to different provinces and application of powers within a province,we believe there will be considerable scope for restriction.We intend to lay great  emphasis on this aspect in our furtherconEiunication to Local  Governments and not only to consult  them as to particular chapters which it is necessary to extend to each province but also  to ask for lists showing restriction of powers within provinces. We should hope that this wouldprovide material for valuable publicity.         6. We consider it essential to secure continuity ofaction. For this purpose it would be necessary to promulgateOrdinance a few days before 3rd July and to include in it aprovision validating continuance of action taken under existingOrdinances.
         7. We consider- it necessary to look ahead and considercourse of action should movement persist beyond expiry of furthersix months, namely beyond end of present calendar year. We areclear that we cannot advise Governor-General to promulgate a third Ordinance to deal with a continuation of the situation.It would be wrong in principle to do so and would be open to serious practical objections, We therefore consider that actionnow proposed should be followed by Central and Provinciallegislation. Should the course of the movement durina- the next two or three months make it clear that any special powers willbe required beyond the expiration of the consolidated Ordinance atpresent, idea is that the Viceroy should hold conference of governors towards the end of August, or beginning of September,when decisions will be reached as to necessity of legislation,scope of it, and its distribution between the Central and provincial Legislatures.   In the meantime, we propose to make itperfectly clear to Local Governments that, if it becomesevident as a result of continuation of the conditions, that powers will be required which can properly be taken byProvincial Legislatures, it will be incumbent on provincial governments to introduce the necessary legislation as soon as isfeasible after that necessity becomes clear, and that we shallnot entertain any proposals from them to confer such powers byOrdinance.         8. Action now necessary is:                             ;         (a) your approval to policy above proposed, subject to your sanction of contents of Consolidated Ordinance which we willcommunicate at early date;         (b.) communication to Local Governments of draftOrdinance and of. general statement of policy as above explained;         (c) ascertainment of final views of Local governments before 20th June, with particular reference to paragraph 5 above;                                                           (d)
         (d) your subsequent approval to any changes incontents of Ordinance which replies of the Local governments may suggest.         9. We would now ask for your early approval of policy.1   Telegram  from Secretary of State  to. Government  of  India,                      Dated 10th June 1932.lbOO.     Your telegram dated 4th June No.1334*  I acceptyour conclusions  as  to the existence of emergency andapprove policy proposed,  subject to communication ofcontents of Consolidated  Ordinance.  I attach great importanceto restriction of application of vatious chapters ofOrdinance to Provinces as far as possible, and also withinProvinces themselves.         I also agree  with your view that third Ordinance wouldbe open to grave objections and that proper course will be toproceed by legislation, if it appears that special powers will still be necessary at  end of year.
