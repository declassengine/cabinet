IRISH  FREE  STATE.     In  accordance v/ith Conclusion  3(4)  of the meetingof the Cabinet  on June 29th s I circulate a memorandum prepared by  the Departments concerned as to the specificcommodities  to  be subiect to duty on  the coming intooperation  of the Irish Free State (Special Import Duties)Act.                              (Intld.) Jo H. T.R E T.ly lsts 1932.
        Since the decisions taken on the 29th June, theDepartments concerned have reviewed the tentative proposalsfor raising  3,000,000 a year &quot;by Customs duties on importsfrom the Irish B^ree State which were put forward in appendix i to IfcJL 227(32).   2.    There is a choice of two courses, i.e., (a) a generalduty on all imports from the Irish Pree State, and (b) a dutyon selected commodities.   The first course would avoid anyquestion of discrimination between different classes of goods and would have the merit of simplicity in presentation.   Itwould, however, involve duties on a variety of goods which nor-mally enter the United Kingdom in small quantities and thuswould add appreciably to work of administration.   This isspecially true of goods passing over the land frontier betweenthe Irish Pree State and Northern Ireland.    Here there is aconsiderable retail trade and the trouble incurred in collectingduties on e, g., bread, or numerous classes of drapery, would be altogether disproportionate to the amount of revenue raised.   3.    The alternative is a selective tariff such as that suggested in the previous Memorandum, i.e., :-Net Imports from Irish Pree State.

     These duties would not produce  3 millions and inorder to make up the balance required, viz.   200,000,  it  wassuggested in the previous Memorandum as one  alternative (theother being a surtax on beer) that duties at 15% might be imposed on the main items of raw materials and manufacturesimported from the Free State.4.   It will be seen that two rates of duty are suggested inthe above table, the higher in cases where it is thought  thatthe incidence of the duty would fall mainly on Irish FreeState producers and the lower where there is reason to thinkthat the incidence might fall to a considerable extent on united Kingdom consumers.   In the nature of the casedifferentiation in the proposed rates must be largelyarbitrary and. might not be easy of defence in debate.    It issuggested therefore as the result of further consideration that it would be preferable to impose a flat rate on allitems in the table.   A flat rate of 20% ad valorem would belikely to produce a revenue of approximately  3 million perannum instead of the  2.8 million expected to be derivedfrom duties of 15% and 25% ad valorem.   In this way it wouldnot be necessary to go beyond the articles in the table andimpose further duties in order to bring up the total estimatedrevenue to  3 millions.   In so far however as the incidence of the duty on store animals might fall on United Kingdomfarmers, this would constitute an objection to increasing therate of duty from 15% to 20%.5.   A criticism of the suggested tariff might be that it is confined almost entirely to foodstuffs.   This would be largelytrue even if an all-round general tariff were imposed as
compared with retained imports of raw materials248amounting to  -i 3 million and of manufactures amountingto  lj million.To tax any items in these last two classes v/ould therefore yield little revenue  and greatlyadd to the difficulties of administration.6.It was pointed out in the previous memorarandumthat an additonal duty of, say 10/- per standard barrel(approximately 14% on the cei.f. value )  on beer (Guinness)might yield up to  500,000t   An additional duty on beer would present no difficulty in administration but if it led toany considerable decline in the consumption of Irishbeer in the United Kingdom which V/as not offset by anincreased consumption of United Kingdom beer, the exchequer would not only fail to realise the estimated revenue fromthe special duty but would also lose part of the existingbeer duty.   It is however considered more probable thatthe aggregate consumption of beer would not fall much,consumers either continuing to drink Guinness or sub-stituting a stout made in this country.7,     If it V/ere decided to impose a flat rate duty onbeer as well as on the articles enumerated in the table inparagraph 3, it is estimated that a duty on those articles                 sat   the rate of l&amp;-7% V/ould suffice together with the specialbeer duty, to produce approximately  Smillion,    Analternative might be to impose a duty of 2G% on thearticles enumerated in the table and to hold the possibilityof  a duty on beer in reserve if the 20% duty proved insufficientor  a larger sum than  5 million were required.8,     A draft Order -for bringing the hew duties intooperation is being prepared and will be circulated as s&quot;donas possible.9.     The Commissioners &apos;of Customs and Excise desire todraw special attention to paragraphs 9 and 10 of Appendix I
   c.P-to^Se^. 227 (32)  which relate to the complications  whichmust inevitably arise in the Customs administrationof the land frontier in Northern Ireland  when the  new duties are imposed.    It is for consideration whetherthe Government of Northern Ireland should be  taken  into consultation in regard to administration  before  the new duties come into force.
