 OTHER TELEGRM from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary of  State for the Colonies^ Dated 15th June, 1932.   Received  in the Colonial Office at llo55 aom0 on 16th Junep 1932*                      u  t.-&apos;   i*    op   *** &apos;C9 ti* ti* -afl No.205^15th June.   On reading  through correspondence on Assyrian (?orisis) I find that in some of the earlier telegrams  &quot;&quot;Disbanded1&quot; haB been loosely used in such a way as to convey impression  that we proposed to restrain movements  af men after  discharge and disbandment from Leviese   It Eras  recognised that from  the first that it would be impracticable  and illegal to do this and proposal was to avoid  disbandment and to exercise restraint only over men who were still wearing uniform  and drawing full pay  and rations after they had handed in their  armne          In  order to present clearer picture to you of fate of Assyrians if  they are disbanded I  v^ould point out that  expression in paragraph  5 of your No^lSl81  mus^ be left free to  return to their homes&quot;  is in fact meaning!es:u   Of 1B540 Assyrians noir serving in the Levies 550 have  their families numbering 1,,646  souls living with them in their stations.   Remainder have no homes  but support on an average 5 refugees who are lodging with Assyrian ?settlers in  various parts of the  country.   Effect  of  disbandmentwill be that  about 8S000 Assyrians will loss their livelihood  andhaving no homes to go to will presumably join National,  concentration of which they will form important  and discontented nucleus*    IfAssyrians in lv&amp;oA Army and Police  follow lead of Levies and  deserttheir posts further 4,,000 unemployed (including dependents) will beadded to this mass of homeless wandsrersc   Movement if allowed toproceed unchecked will therefore result inevitably in pauperisationof Assyrians unless they are able  to possess themselves of land                                                          capable
capable of supporting them as agricultureatae   I am advised thatno such land acceptable to Assyrians is available in Iraq unlessacquired by force.   Plan for employment of Assyrians which wasunder discussion here was to absorb 1,250 of the present Leviesinto the Air Defence Force gradually diminishing to a permanentminimum of 600 men by the end of two years from the date of termination of the Mandate,   Iraq Government had expressed itselfready to find employment in Iraq Army and Police for men discharged from the Levies.   This plan which has been explained to the levies will fall to the ground if diBbandment takes place and immediate loss of pay involved will be 90e000 Rupees a montfcuAdditional loss if Assyrians in Army and Police throw up their employment will bring total to about  10B000 a month which is sufficient to support all Assyrian, refugees in Iraq.
