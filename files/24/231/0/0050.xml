THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1932.SECRET.    .                                          Copy No.   9CP. 249  (32).CABINET.GRANT OF A GENERAL SERVICE MEDAL  FOR OPERATIONS ON                    THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER.            MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR AIR.    1.   THE  question of the grant of a  campaign medal in respect of  theoperations carried out on the  North-West  Frontier between April, 1930, and march,  1931,  has  lately  been  considered by the Inter-departmental RewardsCommittee, who have  recommended by a  majority vote of- the  War  Office,Admiralty and Colonial Office, the India Office and Air Ministry dissenting, thatno medal should be awarded.    2.   I feel strongly that the acceptance of this recommendation would be unfair to the personnel affected, and that the operations in question were fully asarduous as those in recent years in respect of  which  campaign medals were awarded.  To take only the operations between April and September 1930, I maymention that the 84 aircraft engaged came under heavy fire and 43 were hit, manyof them a number of times; 8,500 hours flying was carried out in the course ofactual operations, which is more than three times as much as the corresponding figure for the  Waziristan operations of 1925, in  respect of  which a medal wasawarded;  1,180 aircraft attacks were made  against 26 tribes or section of  tribesover a  front  of 180 miles from the respective air bases; and  lastly  that  the difficult and mountainous country over which the operations were carried out,and the fact that they took place at the height of the hot weather, imposed a very heavy strain on all concerned.    3.   I am, however, loth to ask the Cabinet itself to undertake the detailed examination of this matter,  and would therefore suggest the  adoption of  theprocedure which was followed in 1929, when the grant of a campaign medal  forthe operations against  the Akhwan tribes was the subject of difference betweenthe departments concerned.  On that occasion the War Office dissented from  therecommendation of the Inter-departmental Rewards Committee  in favour of  thegrant of  a  medal,  and the  Cabinet appointed a small  sub-Committee ofthree Ministers,  chosen f: tm independent Departments,  to examine the matter.I suggest that a similar committee should be appointed to consider the grant ofthe medal for  operations on the North-West Frontier.    A ir Ministry, July 21, 1932.                                    L.[72741
