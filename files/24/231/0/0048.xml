Statement as to certain  modifications which it is proposed    to make in the London Passenger Transport Bill.  Since the present Government  took  office negotiations  and dis-cussions have proceeded with various parties concerned with a viewto meeting  certain objections  which have  been expressed to theBill in its present form.  2.  Representations have been received  to  the effect that  it is undesirable  that the appointment of the Board should  be vested,wholly or partially,  in the hands of the Government of  the day,as this might involve a risk of political interference in constituting a  business  body.   The  conclusion has been  reached that  anyapprehensions on  this  score  can most effectively  be  removed ifthe selection of the Board is entrusted to a small body of indepeml-ent persons.  It is  therefore proposed  to provide in the Bill forthe setting  up of five appointing  trustees, who  will  be personsholding office for the time being in statutory or professional bodies.to be  specified  (subject  to  their concurrence)  in  the  Bill suchas :       The Chairman of the London County Council;      A  representative of the  London  and Home  Counties Traffic    Advisory Committee.      The Chairman of the Bankers&apos; Clearing House ;      The President of the  Institute  of Chartered Accountants of    England and  Wales ;      The President of  the  Law Society;This body (in place of the Minister  of Transport) would be chargedwith the duty  of  appointing the  Chairman and other  members ofthe London Passenger Transport Board, whose qualifications wouldbe those set out in the Bill, and fixing their terms of office withinthe limits prescribed.   3. In order to meet the objection that the  Bill confers  excessivepowers upon the  Minister of Transport, it is proposed ito transfer to the Railway Kates Tribunal the power to order new or  improvedservices and facilities and other analogous powers, leaving with theMinister only those duties which are ordinarily imposed upon himby Parliament in regard to statutory  transport authorities, or aremodifications  of his existing  statutory duties,  or are  matters of-machinery.
