In the absence of the President of the Board ofTrade, I circulate to my colleagues a summary of thereports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Councilon the state of trade in May, 1932.(Intld.)   H.B.Ministry of Labour^ 24th June, 19?2.
     Employment.  The unemployment figures for May relate to theMonday after Whit week, when employment is usually at a low levelowing to extensions of holiday stoppages.  These figures show anincrease of 89,000 compared with those for April, mainly onaooount of an increase in the numbers temporarily stopped, theindustries chiefly affected being the textile and boot and shoeIndustries.  The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, fellby 25,000, but temporary stoppages show an increase of 114,000.The increase in unemployment was mainly in the Horth and in theMidlands;  in the South of England and in Wales there was areduction.   Employment in the building and distributive tradesshowed a slight improvement.     Over se as Trade.  During the past month Imports of Merchandiseand Exports of United Kingdom goods show decreases of  14 million and SSx&quot; million respectively compared with the figures for May1931, while exports of Imported Merchandise decreased by nearly If- million..  The Imports of manufactured articles were nearly 9^ million less than in May 1931*     Railway Traffic.  Railway Traffic receipts of the four                         -amalgamated oompanies showed a decrease of 10.25$ compared withMay 1931, passenger traffic alone decreased by more than 9$, ooaltraffic by 5?i, and other freight traffic by nearly 14-1$,     The number of men employed in all companies in 191? was591,000;  in 1931 this had increased to 616,000 but it has nowdiminished to about 595,000.  Sixty per cent, of the staff is working short time.     The most Interesting question affecting railways In thelast few weeks relates to the proposals by the London &amp; NorthEastern and the London Midland &amp; Scottish for pooling theirreceipts for competitive traffic.  These proposals have been                                                          rtr-             STATE OF TRADE - MAY,  19?2.Summary of Reports made to the Board of Trade Advisory Council in connection with their meeting on June  9th, 1932, (supplemented in some oases with information              from other sources).
referred by the Ministry of Transport to a Committee of Inquiry.     Foreign railway receipts show for 1931 the followingdecreases compared with the figures for 1930 - Swiss FederalRailways, 4.8 per cent;  French ^Railways 9.2 per cent;  BelgianRailways 12.4)0;  German Railways 15. 8$-j   and Class I Railways ofthe United States 20.7o.   The corresponding decrease for^nglish main line railways was 8. 2;i.    In the matter of reductionof working expenses United States Railways saved 17.9.3 of theirexpenses;  German railways 11.4$;   British railways 7.8&apos;,&apos;oj  BelgianRailways 5.7/i;  and Swiss Railways 1.8.4,   Comparative figuresfor French Railways are not available.     Coal Mining,   employment in the coal mining industry inGreat Britain was slightly better than in the previous month butover 48,000 more workers were unemployed than a year ago.   Theaverage weekly output for the 13 weeks ended 21st May last was6.2,o less than in the corresponding period of 1931 and 15.5$ lessthan in the corresponding period ox 1930;  it should be notedhowever that the 7,&apos;hit sun tide holidays occurred during the period under review in 1932 but not in the corresponding periods for1930 and 1931.   In  the export market there was little change;trade was affected by the restrictions which are at presentplaced upon the importation of British coal in almost every country which produces  coal itself,   The aggregate quantitiesexported during May  to Scandinavian countries were greater thanin May 1931 but less than in May 1930.     Iron and Steel.   Business in the iron and steel markets ingeneral has continued at a low level.   At home the depression inthe  steel consuming  trades has prevented fresh buying of any importance whilst the  conditions in many overseas markets due to high tariffs, quota  schemes and restrictions on exchange dealings,have severely curtailed exports.   The output of pig iron and ofsteel ingots and castings was lower than in the previous month and lower also than  in May 1931.   Imports of iron and steel inMay  show a decrease  compared with May 1931 but practically no
                                                          i \ ochange compared with April, 1932.                         I^d     A certain amount of business in semi-finished steel was still being placed with Continental makers whose quotations(admittedly involving loss) were well below the cost of manu-facture in this country notwithstanding the protection afforded by the British duties and the depreciation of sterling.     Shipping and Shipbuilding.   There was a general reductionin the demand for tonnage and trade was hampered everywhere byexchange restrictions or by the desire to exclude imports.   Thefigures for laid-up tonnage showed little change.   The freightindex number declined:  outward market rates remained withoutmovement until the end of the month when the rate to buenos aires showed some improvement.   From Canada there was a fairamount of chartering at very low rates.   There was no appreciable improvement in the shipbuilding position.   Onesteamer was placed for the China Navigation Company and a collierfor one of the Gas Companies but there were no orders for oceantrading.     Machine Tools.   During April machine tools to the valueof -2494,000 (or 89.1 per cent, of the total exports of suchtools) were sent to Russia compared with an export to thatdestination of -285,000 (or 54.8/. of the total) in April, 1931.Owing to exchange restrictions imposed by the Danish Government,importers to Denmark had great difficulty in securing sterlingto liquidate their indebtedness in this country.   The machine tools Association have submitted to the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee a proposal that duties on machine tools should be levied on a tonnage instead of on an ad valorem basis with theobject of discriminating against low grade tools.     Electrical Industry.   The electrical industry was working at 60&apos; of its capacity and the cessation of orders for the &apos;grid*transmission, which is now practically complete, presents aserious problem with regard to the utilisation of the raanu-facturing capacity which has been employed on such work.   The
home market obtained a few large orders recently and thefigures for the past month were not materially different  fromthose of a year ago;  export &quot;business was poor and was handi-capped by exchange restrictions.  The output of currentgenerated by authorised undertakers during the first four monthsof this year  showed an increase of 7.6 per cent, on thecorresponding period of 1931.     Motor Indus tryr  Apart from a general falling off ofbusiness since Whitsuntide the conditions in the Motor industryshowed little change.  The production of cars below  16 h.p.increased during the first quarter of 1932 as compared with thecorresponding period of 1931 (due apparently t^ the  incidence of motor taxation);  the production of cars of over  16 h.p.showed a decline during the same periods;  the commercialvehicle industry remained comparatively stagnant.  The numbersof private cars and chassis and of commercial vehicles exportedduring the first four months of 1932 have increased by over5055 compared with the same period of 1931, the greater success in this trade being in foreign markets.   The financialrestrictions imposed by Denmark are however greatly hinderingthe export of cars  to that country.     Cotton,   Business in the Lancashire cotton industry wasto some extent disorganised by the Whit week holiday but  after allowing for this there was a definite decline in activity,Production is somewhat greater than it was before Great Britainleft the gold standard, but sales have fallen to the level oflast July, August and early September,  Unemployment, exceptamong weavers, was  higher at the end of May than at any time since November but  as the increase was mainly in short timeworkers the figures were possibly  affected by an extension ofthe Whitweek stoppage in  certain mills.  The continued fall inraw  cotton prices made it difficult to do business.  Althoughthe  lifting of  the  boycott  in  the  Par East and the  depreciation of  the yen have  enabled Japan  to increase her exports of cotton piece  goods, British trade has not been seriously affected.  At
present about 45.* of the British, export trade in cottonmanufactures is with Empire countries:  there was little evidence of an improvement in the home  market.     Wool.  The woollen and worsted industries were depressedold contracts were run off and new ones were difficult  toobtain;  as a consequence activities suffered a setback, butthey were better than a year ago.  ExportE of woollen and worstedyarns continued to show an improvement on last year&apos;s figures and although the exports oi tissues showed a decline for thefirst five months of 1932, compared with the correspondingperiod of 1951, those for isaay 1932 were larger than for iuay 1931.The scale of the present British duties excluded all but acomparatively small proportion oi imports.     Silk and Artificial silk.  A few branches of the silk and artificial silk Industries are already benefitting by the importduties recently imposed; hosiery workers in the Midlands whowere unemployed are now fully employed.  The depression in theUnited States (which normally absorbs about 80j  of the  worldTsproduction of raw silk) has continued to affect adversely theprices of raw material.  The production of art?;?.?, oiai silk inthis country during 1932 is lik6ly to average 6h million lbs.per month compared with less than 4^ million lbs. per monthon 1931.     Other industries.  As regards other industries, thegeneral improvement in  the chemical trades reported recentlywas not continued except in the  tar products section, where ^there was satisfactory  progress.  The trade in edible oils &amp;c.showed a  marked advance and the  decline in the volume ofbusiness  for the current year, which at the end of April was20^, had  been  reduced  to  just over  10;*. at the end of &apos;&quot;ay.There was little chang: in  the build.ng trade; imports ofbricks and  cement  showed a  decline  compared with 1931 and building  by private enterprise  was  not so brisk as  it was ayear ago.The production of  boots and shoes  during April was                     -5-
less than in April 1931.   The poor weather conditions arestated to have affected adversely the home market for rubberfootwear and sports goods.     The Wheat Situation.   The factor which still controls thoworld wheat situation is the production of winter wheat In  theUnited States which, according to the latest official estimates.Is likely to be 441 million bushels compared with 787 million bushels in 1931.  The Co-operative Wholesale Society considerthat even if the new crop in the United States is smaller than usual the &quot;carry over&quot; from former crops in that country willprovide a considerable quantity of wheat for export.  the acreage  under wheat is being extended in the Argentine and goodcrops  are probable in Canada and Uussia;  it is likely there-fore that there will be a large surplus of exportable wheat.World import requirements for 1931-2 are estimated by Broomhallat 776 million bushelsj  shipments during the present orop  yearhave averaged 15.6 million bushels per week and It only requires a weekly shipment of IS.4 million bushels for the remaining 11weeks of  the year to reach the foregoing estimate.     Hetail Trade.  There was a decline in retail trade of  2.2 per cent, in April compared with April 1931, the decline was.3 per cent, for the periods February-April.  The value of stocks (at cost) showed a greater percentage decrease than  sales,comparing end of April, 1932 and April, 1931.     The Co-operative Wholesale Society reported that, comparedwith a year ago, the most recent figures (for May)  showed  adecrease of 5.3% in sales, explained to some extent by the  *Whitsuntide holidays.  During the past month there has been aphenomenal fall in the pries of Danish butter, which nowapproximates to that of Australian.     Finance. The reduction of the bank rate to 2%fo was one of the features in the money market during the month.  Depositsshowed a large Increase.  There were no foreign Issues ofImportance and there was no largo demand from industry for  money.
In financial circles the view was held that any real improvementin trade was dependent upon a satisfactory outcome of the Lausanneand Ottawa Conferences and more especially upon arrangements which would secure the removal of exchange restrictions.     A growing distrust of rationalisation v/as exemplified by thedecision of the United tiWM Steelworks to decentralise andregroup geographically certain branches of its iron and steel production for the purpose of reducing working costs.     Proposals have been made for reduction in the capital ofGermany^ two leading Shipping Companies, the North German Lloydand the Hamburg American Line.     AustralianmTrade;    A good season is anticipated in theCommonwealth.   For the 10 months ended in April imports decreased by  14 million (to  46 million) and exports increased by  5 million (to  90 million), compared with the corresponding periodof the previous trade year.     Canadian Trade.  Industrial operations during April were ona somewhat smaller scale than in the previous month.  Exports toGreat Britain in April amounted to $7,378,000 - an increase ofover $1,000,000 compared with April 1931.     Indian Trade.  The trade returns for April show for thefirst time since October 1922 an excess of imports over exportsof merchandise - a position which v/as rectified by large privatenet exports of gold.  During the last fiscal year (1931-8)shipments to Great Britain increased by 6^ (to 27,.) over those for 1930-1 and to the British Empire by over 8&apos;^ (to 44f-).     South American Trade.  High import duties and exchange control rendered trading with the principal South american countries increasingly difficult.  Conditions in Argentinaindicated that large supplies of meat and cereals will beavailable for shipment to this country during the next 10months but the low export prices prevailing and the consequent
efforts to reduce wages caused a little labour unrest.   InBrazil internal trade and local finances showed some  improvement,In Colombia finand al difficulties continued  and imports were almost non-existent.   Trade was also at a low ebb in  Uruguaywhere the Government  financial position was also unsatisfactory.
