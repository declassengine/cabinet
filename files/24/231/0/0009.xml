?RAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary ? for the Colonies.

? 15th June. Received Colonial Office 3.15 p.m. 15th June, 1932.

205 15th June,

I have discussed your telegram No. 151 with Air Officer ?manding.

We note that it is not considered advisable either in principle in practice to accede to our request in certain circumstances for ? assistance but we feel that conclusion (3) is based on a complete ?apprehension of our proposals. My telegram No. 201 described (?) commended as disarming levies and retaining them in uniform under ? law in their stations (with their families) ? will be avoided partly in the interests of Assyrians themselves. Levies would ? to draw rations and pay and would be given excuse which many are ? to desire to serve on and be spared a life of poverty. It was ? that mere presence of British troops would preserve calm and inspire confidence all round.

Our plan of keeping levies under restraint was also intended ? fulfil what we held to be our obligation towards Iraq Government by preventing dangerous concentration at most inopportune moment. To disband ? and leave them free to join concentration in North seemed to us to ? grave risk of. (a) desertion of Assyrians in Iraq police and ? still engaged in Bar?an operations (b) Assyrian  concentration which ? Government are at present  powerless to control, becoming a ? peace and finally being means (which may well be in the minds of Iraq ? postponement of Iraq&apos;s entry into League. (c) suspicion being aroused ? mind of Iraqis, if we allow matters to take their course, that Government have connived at Assyrian Coup de main which will have been ? by 5437 rifles issued by us in the past to discharged Levy ?.

When once Assyrians have been allowed to carry out their plan of
of concentration unhampered and have burnt their boats in regard to service, both in British and Iraqi forces (involving a gratuitous loss in pay of many thousands of pounds a month), it is unanimous opinion of experts here that there in every prospect of situation utmost gravity developing which may wreck work of ten years.

It was these considerations which induced Air Officer Commanding and myself to recommend prompt action should be taken to help Assyrians to save themselves from their own folly and to ? Iraq Government that we were not indifferent to the dangerous potentialities of an unchecked fanatical movement on the part of Assyrians which might retard realisation of Iraq&apos;s independence. In other words we suggested small temporary reinforcements now in order to minimise risk of large reinforcements being required later.

I shall do my utmost to procure withdrawal of manifesto and if this is impossible, to mitigate harmful effect of disbandment and national concentration by every means in my power.
