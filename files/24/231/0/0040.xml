(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF EIS BRITABETIC? MAJESTY1 S QtffVSSSiSSm) .on 15th, December,  1931,  the necessity for the introduction oflegislation for the purpose of amending and clarifying the land drainage Act,  1930, was recognised, and a Land Drainage Bill wa3inserted in List D (Useful Bills, mainly non-controversial).in considering the provisions of the existing Act requiringamendment in the light of experience, and the Parliamentary Draftsmenare now engaged in preparing the necessary Bill0  It is unlikely,however, that the Amending  Bill will &quot;be ready &quot;before the Nowin many parts of England and particularly in what is known asthe Doneaster Drainage District, involving widespread damage and acute di3tress0  Indeed, the area around the mining district of Bentley and Arksey has &quot;been completely inundated for the second time since last summer, and a large number of people have again&quot;boon forced out of their homes for several weeks,(z)              The Drainage Board for this area is a special   ,Board created under the Boncaster Act, 1929, on the recommendationsof a special Commission appointed in view of the Report of the RoyalCommission on Mining Subsidence,  It possesses certain specialpowsre enabling it to require th3 coal mining interests to carryout remedial works where land drainage has been affected bymining subsidence, and the Co?-liery owners have representatives on the Board,  In addition to these powers, the Drainage Board(1)At a meeting of the Home Affairs Committee, heldSince that date my Department have been engaged(2)In tha meantime disastrous floods have occurred
possesses the ordinal powers conferred on a Drainage Board by theLand Drainage Act, 1950, or the legislation which that Act superseded(4)       Now that Government grants for unemplos^nent relief havebeen withdrawn, the Drainage Board are quite unable to find themoney necessary to carry out works likely to obviate flooding oftheir area, apart from any work they may be entitled to call uponthe colliery owners to carry out.   It is imperative, therefore,that provision should be made to transfer the powers possessed by this Drainage Authority, especially as regards the coal miningindustry, to some authority whose financial resources will enablethem to deal with the situation.(5)       The Yorkshire Ouse Catchment Board and the Trent CatchmentBoard constituted under the Land Drainage Act, 1930 , within whoseareas the Doncaster Drainage District as comprised, have, with the aquiescence of the Doncaster Drainage Board, applied to me for amending legislation to transfer the powers of the Doncaster board to themselves, so as to enable the necessary remedial works to bocarried out by the Catchment Boards who have power to raise revenueby precept on the County Councils and County Borough Councils within their area.   This could be achieved by the amendment of therelative Section in the Land Drainage Act, 1930, but the urgency of this matter which was emphasised in the recent dobato in theHouse of Commons, demands that the nocessarj&apos;&quot; provisions should form the subject of a special Bill for the amendment of theDoncastor Act, to bo introduced in tho Autumn Session-(6)       Such a Bill would , I boliovo , bo mainly non-contentious,especially if, as I propose, tho coal mining interests are affordedtho protection and tho representation on tho Cabonmont Boards thatthoy receive on the Donoasoar Board.   The Bill would have tofollow tho Private Bill pioccdure, and therefore, apart from tho
Second Reading stage, should not take up much time in theHouse.  It would &quot;be necessary, however, as a matter ofemergency, to ask the House to suspend the Standing orders which require advertisement in the locality in the case of bills of this nature,(7)    It is important that some indication of the intentions of the Government should be made before the House  rises, andI accordingly ask my colleagues to agree to my announcing thatthe Government propose to introduce and pass into law suohamending legislation in the Autumn.  This would, of course, not prejudice the introduction of a more general Bill amending theLand Drainage Act, 1930, after the New Year,                            (Intld.)
