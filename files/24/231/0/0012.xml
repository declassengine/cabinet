CYPHER TELBGRiM from the Secretary of State  for the colonies to the High Commissioner of Iraq             (Sent 11.20 p.m,, X6th June,,  1932,)Immediate *  Secret.No, 153.          See my immediately preceding telegram.   The  following are points raised by the War Office:-   (a)    Mo&amp;ifi&amp;Li  In order to ninimise the risk of heavyfcas&amp;altiea from sickness with these unacclimatised troops, themedical authorities consider the following general measuresessentials -   1.   The troops must be properly housed in;-        (&amp;) Barracks with fans*        (b) Barracks, if without fans,, with  other anti-heat            measures,        (c) if not in barracks, in double  fly E Jpa tents.   2*   Adequate supply of fresh rations and suitable  cooking        arrangements.   3,   Means of sterilisation of water, if  not from approved        source.   4o   Adequate supply of iee and minerals.   5o   Suitable clothing for day and night.   6.   Adequate means of ablution.   7,.   Efficient sanitary arrangements with skilled supervision.   8,   Adequate medical arrangements.   (b)    Strategical,  The use of a  battalion  for the  purposeproposed is regarded as militarily unsound,  more especially asit is tactically immobile when transported by air, owing to lack of regimental vehicles.
          iVhilo wo note yowr opinion that the mere  presenceof a British battalion will preserve calm and  inspire  confidence,we should like you to consider the situation that might  developshould opposition be encountered from the Levies and a needfar shooting arise;  it might well be that the  battalion,,possibly dispersed8 would be in the eentre of an area  of unrestnorth of Baghdad.   If in addition the Marah Arabs  and otherpossibly disaffected tribes seize  on the opportunity to make themselves obnoxious, we might see a repetition of  the happeningsof 1920,   Not only would it then be impossible to  extricatethe battalion, but reinforcements  on a large seals  might be needed,   It is unnecessary to emphasise to you the lengths towhich reduction of units in the Army has gone;   reinforcementscould only be despatched by recourse to  mobilisation.   Thedespatch of another battalion by air would gravely  increase our commitments and aggravate the  military situation for thereasons given above o   Should considerations 0;f State  demand the despatch of one battalion P we  suggest that  it should bekept concentrated as far as possible, as the tactical  risksare obviously much greater if the  battalion is  dispersed&apos;  but apart from this suggestion War Office do not intend to impose restrictions on its use which might tie  the hands of the man onthe spot.          Exposure to the sun during the heat  of the day isa fruitful sowrcie of sickness and we hope that  this will beboma in mind in allotting the distiesc

(Sent 9,30 p,m,8 16fe JuneB  1932c)IMMEDIATE.No,152,  Secret*          Cabinet have given prolonged consideration to yourtelegram No,205,   Final decision will not be taken till m havereply to this telegram.   Factors which Cabinet have to considerare     (a)  health of troops     (b)  strategic     (c)  political,   (a)  Health, .  Unless War Office are satisfied that conditionsexist which will effectively safeguard against serious risk ofheatstroke and ensure adequate medical treatment if eas^s ariss,,they cannot consent to despatch a Battalion from Egypt&apos;s which isonly Battalion which could be made available,   Points on whichthey want information as regards this are given in my immediately following telegram,   (b)  Strategic.   Military difficulties felt by War Office aregiven in my immediately following telegram also possiblemodification!? which War Office think might reduce or avoid these difficulties a3 far as possible.   Would War Office modificationsenable you to -achieve the end in view?   If not have you any    Jalternative suggestions to overcome military difficulties?   Inparticular, under suggested modifications,  could Battalioneffectively prevent men of levies whom you think it necessary tohold, from joining concentration, or at any rate hold a sufficient number of such men to prevent concentration being effective?   Is                                                             could
 could certainly not contemplate despatch of a Battalion unless you are  satisfied that use of that Battalion under conditions which War  Office must attach will be effective for the purpose for which   - you  require itc   (c)  Political-   You know Cabinet feel great political difficulties first in sending British troops to Iraq at all at present time, and secondly, using British forces for purpose of coercing Assyrian levies.   Assuming conditions under (a) and (b) can  be satisfied Cabinet would only contemplate sending a Battalion if it is the only means to avert the grave consequences you predict if Battalion not sentQ   If a Battalion is sent Cabinet are anxious as to possible developments;  for example     (1)   If levies resist disarmament or detention British troops might become involved in serious fighting with them;     (2)   How could British troops in fact prevent them dispersing?     (3)   If they attempt to escape, is it intended that British troops should shoot down unarmed Assyrians?     (4)   If they do not shoots if necessary,, how will increasing dispersal of levies be prevented?     (5)   May not British Battalion be retained indefinitely       - because risk of concentration continues?.     (6)   Cabinet wish to be satisfied why it is impossible to use available Iraq, troops to hold levies.          Cabinet have considered possibility of sending re-inforcements from India.   This is (1)  politically impossible (2) impracticable because re-inforcements could not arrive in time,,          (Cabinet are impressed with importance of obtaining a fair settlement of Assyrian political claims.   It would be infinitelypreferable to overcome difficulty by political means than by show                                                              of
of force   They feel this very important not only  to relievepresent tension but also as insurance of peace  in future  and toavoid possible repercussion in Geneva and risk  of protractedmilitary commitments hereafter..          What is latest date by which Battalion must arrive if your plan is approved?     Priyate,and^ Personals   I am uure you will  appreciate  that?apart from difficulties,, healthy strategice politicalP which Ihave put to youp British forces are so reduced  that it is reallyimpossible to contemplate military re-inform^cements  on a large scale now or in the futureo    Moreovers  I do not believe that e ianthe National Government could carry Parliament  end  the country in approving serious military operations in Irao^
