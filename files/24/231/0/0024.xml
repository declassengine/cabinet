BOBET.,P. 225(52).                                       COPY NO:   ^                          C A B I N E  T.                         AIR DISARMAMENT.           Memorandum &quot;by the Chief of  the Air Staff           circulated in the absence of  the Secretary           of  State  for Air, by direction of the Lord                      President of  the  Council.                I  have been in communication with the Secretary  of State      for Air in connection with the provisional formula regarding air      disarmament  reached during the recent informal meetings with the      French and United States Delegations, the  terms of which  are      given in  telegram 255 L.N. (R) dated 20th June, 1932.  He      instructs me to put before H.M. Government this Memorandum which      embodies  his views.                Paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of  the proposed formula call for      no particular comments at this stage with  the  exception that,  as      agreed at Geneva, troop carriers  and flying boats must be exempted      under paragraph 1.                Paragraph 3 is, however,  in his  opinion fraught with      such  far-reaching and dangerous implications  that he  feels bound      to recommend that it should not be  accepted.   The paragraph in      question  reads  as followss-           &quot;(3) All  kinds of aerial bombardment shall be       prohibited at a distance of more  than X kilometres  from       the front  except in the case of air bases and long-range       gun emplacements.  It was understood that exceptions       should  be  made to enable continuance of police functions       of aircraft in colonial territories, etc.  (Note.       Question of restricting bombardment by Naval aircraft       should  be  discussed)&quot;.      2.         The Secretary of State  for Air is in the fullest sympathy     with the  desire for the protection of the civil population which     promotes  this proposal.   He is,  however,  certain that it would  fail      to  attain this object.   In the first place,  the restriction by     arbitrary lines of military/
                                                         &apos;    142      action against military objectives is entirely foreign to      the whole conception of war, and would not survive in      practice.  It is  only necessary to refer to the considered      opinion  of that Cabinet Committee which enquired into Air      Disarmament policy  only six weeks ago.   They stated      (CD, (B) 6, Para. 9):  &quot;....With great reluctance we feel      bound to admit that &quot;in the overwhelming stress of  a war      which threatens the life  of a nation no reliance can be      placed on the observance  of artificial laws of war.&quot;             It is an axiom that those laws only are observed      which command general respect.  It is unbelievable that any      nation would respect a law which, for instance, recognised      as legitimate the &quot;bombing of Southampton and Dover, but      which would presumably afford protection to Woolwich and      Aldershot, or which protected the concentration of a military      striking force a  few miles behind the  &quot;X&quot; line.      3.    If the proposal is accepted, His Majesty&apos;s  Government      must  at  once face the  question  whether they are justified      in relying in war-time on this  paper  guarantee, which      necessarily commits us to the abolition of our means of      defence. The Cabinet  Committee just  referred  to  agreed  that      the acceptance  of an  international pact which  appeared to      guarantee  the security of London, would render difficult the      maintenance  of  adequate  forces  for  defence, and for  this      reason,among  others,  they stated in  their Report  :-                   &quot;The  proposed rule  (for  the  total  prohibition                    of bombing)  would not  result in making    i                    London ma:&apos;e  secure,  but  on  the contrary,                    would produce  results  that would be                    dangerous to Its  defence&quot;.              The Secretary of  State  for Air foresees exactly the       same danger  in  this proposal.                               (Signed)   J.M.  SALMOND.                                      CHIEF  OF THE AIR STAFF.Air Ministry,       23rd June,  1932.
