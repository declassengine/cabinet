CTPH.it 1DLSGRAM from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secrete: of State for the Colonies*Dated 12th June, 1932c   Received in the Colonial Office at 12.15 Mon 13th June, 193c,Noo200c  12th June.          Your 149.   i have from the first been strongly (?oppoae t)on general grounds tc asking for reinforcements and shall do myutmost to bring about temporary settlement which will obviate thisnecessity*   On other hand if levies adhere to their determination to cease seeing on 1st July,, as their British officers firmly.believeP I feel that it is essential in order to preserve law andorder in the &quot;North that we should (corrupt group) prevent disarmedlevies from (several corrupt groups)e   I am advised that this car.only be secured by means of British reinforcements which would be described as having been sent temporarily to take the place of locilevies pending the creation of new air defence force provided forin 1930 Treaty.   1 have arranged that representatives of Assyrianofficers from all stations in Iraq (?should) meet me tomorrow morning with leaders *  1 shall explain gravity of steps which thsyare taking and inevitable alienation of British sympathy and trustwhich it would involve.   I shall try to prevail on them formally to repudiate manifesto of 1st June and to enter into solemnundertaking to serve well and truly until lawfully discharged andrefrain from further insubordination of any kind,,   Final decision regarding whether to choose or reject my advice cannot be expecteduntil after national meeting which is due to take place at itaiaaia15th Junee   If my endeavour fails chere seams no alternative but toask for early reinforcements^
                                                                    A 0 iGTfiRUER mBSRSU from      Itanphryea  High Commissioner f Iraq to theSacretary of State for the Colonies.              Dated 12th Jline,   1932,(Received Colonial Office    6.50 a.m.     13th June,    1932)      U  12th June.        With reference to  last paragraphs  your 1^.                      I        I  think it necessary to explain that belief  that Assyrianswould be satisfied with demands &quot;sontained  in second  enclosureto Ludlow  Hewetfs despatch of 14th May was  based on assumption thati&amp;r Shimun and Surma Khanuai had radically  modified their views regarding future of  Ass Syrians under  Iras Government.         Subsequent events have discounted this assumption and thosem closest touch with  Assyrians now assure me  that aim of leaders is omething  mnoh more far-reaching than relatively minor concessions set?ut in enclosure to despatch already  referred  to.          Precise intentions are still  unknown but leaders of Assyrianshave frequently expressed  determination not  to live  under MohammedanGovernment.    They declared that they  will  not return to Turkey, and Ido not believe that they would attempt  to  migrate en masse to Persiao        As regards Syria  I  am informed that overtures were made recentlythrough French Consul  in Mosul  who  (? informed them  that) HighGQsmiissioner Syria had instructed him to say Syria had more  than enoughembarrassment from refugees  already and would  take no more.  Positionas experts*]j(pwlJBiats it is therefore  that  plan of Mar Shimun and other leaders is  to concentrate  all  As ay ri am  in Dohuk-Amadia area (where bulkof Assyrian villages lie)  and then coerce  Britain and Iraq into grantingthem an autonomous enclaves.    The  concentration in  (? this    area)would almost  certainly lead  to  conflict with neighbouring Kurds and thismipiit easily  set alight fire of religious  fanaticism throughout theMosul Liwa.   In any event both HoM.government and Iraq Government wouldbe faced with grave problem of having to deal  with concentration of about1000 determined fighting  men mostly  armed with British rifles and traine                                                                  m
                                          %in Levies.       My aim is  tQ  endeavour to preheat men  at present in Leviesfrom joining concentrations  if possible by persuading officers to withdraw manifesto, but in last  resort by  disarming &quot;them andretaining th^n in uniform under Military Law  in their stations0       If Lem&amp;s  are kept from joining concentration I am hopeful that whole plan may  be  frustratedc
