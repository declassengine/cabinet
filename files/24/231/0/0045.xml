THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.     9CP.  244 (32).CABINET.EXTENSION  OF  THE INDIAN AIR  SERVICE TO SINGAPORE AND                              AUSTRALIA.            MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR AIR.   .1.  NOW that the. service from England to South Africa is in operation, the route to Australia is, the outstanding &quot;gap&apos;&apos; in our, system of Imperial air communications.  For years past proposals for an Australian Service have beenunder consideration, but for one reason or another it has never been possible togive effect to them.    ,  ,    ...  .    Matters have now been brought to a head by the communication by the Dutchauthorities,to the General Post Office, of a concrete scheme for a through air mailservice to Australia to commence this  autumn.   A. temporising reply has been returned for the moment; on the ground that we ourselves have a spheme underconsideration, but  I  understand  the Postmaster-General to  feel  that  a more definite answer will have to be forthcoming in the early future.    2.  My colleagues will doubtless recall  the resolution on the subject  of an australian service which was passed by the Imperial Conference of 1930 andduly  published  in  the  Summary of  Proceedings  presented  to  Parliament(Cmd.  3717) :-         ....  &quot;The Conference expresses  the hope  that.the next stage in  the    development of Empire Air Communications  by the opening in. 1931 of  the    regular Imperial Air. Service between England and South Africa, will be    followed.at  an early.date by  an extension of  the  regular weekly air service    between England and India as far as  Australia.&quot;                     i    3.  The House of Commons is  taking a growing  interest  in this matter, asis evidenced by  continual Parliamentary Questions on the subject,  and by the emphasis laid upon it  in the Debate on Air  Estimates.  Important,  however, asis the project on broad political grounds, it is also, in my view, equally importantcommercially.   I  have received  frequent and weighty representations  fromChambers of Commerce,  great business undertakings, &amp;c,  and all these bodies are strongly of opinion (a) that there is a real demand for such a service and thatit will act as a stimulus to.trade;  and (b) that it would be very unfortunate andreact to ifie detriment of British commerce,and general prestige if the Dutch were allowed, to get in first and operate a regular service; thereby building  up agoodwill which  would prove  a serious  handicap  to any  subsequent  Britishcompetitor.    4.   There is no technical or operational difficulty in the way of the institution of a regular weekly service to Australia  (and thence by boat to New Zealand); thedifficulty hitherto has been simply one of finance, more particularly in Australia.    5.   Quite recently, however,  the position  in Australia  has changed, and proposals are  under discussion in Australia  for &quot;a fusion of local civil aviation      [7260]

As a result of semi-official  negotiations  and consultations between theAir Ministry, the General Post Office,  and Imperial Airways, a  provisional scheme has been prepared, based on all-in charges per \ oz. letter of 8c/. between europe and Calcutta (as  against the existing rate of Qd.  between Europe and  Karachi),lOd. between Europe and  Burma, Is. Od. between Europe  and Singapore, andIs.  3d. between Europe and Australia  (the main cities and also, by boat, NewZealand).   This figure of Is. 3d. has  been adopted on the recommendation of thePost Office as being most likely to encourage, rather  than discourage, the use ofthe air mail to such an extent  as to bring in the maximum receipts.    7.  Imperial  Airways have been asked to co-operate by securing the utmosteconomy compatible with efficiency in the operation  of  the Extension Service to singapore, and by accepting at the outset a considerable reduction in &quot;the credit to be  given to the England-Karachi  service for the  transport of through mailsover that section of the route.  The present scheme thus involves a much smallertotal subsidy than that envisaged in the earlier schemes.  It  is now contemplated that Australia may accept full financial responsibility in regard to the servicebeyond Singapore, and that the subsidy to be found by the  British Governmentin  respect of the service  between Karachi  and Singapore should not exceed 40,000 in the first year,  30,000 in each of the next two years, and  20,000 perannum thereafter, up to the  31st March, 1939, when the Agreement  for theEngland-India Service expires.    8.  Negotiations are in hand with the Government of India in regard to the transit of mails by air between Karachi and Calcutta, as it is desirable  on botheconomic  and operational  grounds that,  if possible, the through mails  shouldbe carried by Imperial Airways without any break  in continuity of operation.The issue of these negotiations need not, however, be awaited before my colleaguesapprove in principle, as I  now ask them to do, the  continuance of negotiationsfor the inauguration of the Australian extension service on the basis of a subsidynot exceeding that mentioned  in the previous paragraph.    9.  Freedom of transit for through mails is all I propose to ask from India,without any subsidy in respect of these mails, which it is clear  cannot possibly be forthcoming. The air mail for Burma will be insignificant  in amount, and it isnot, therefore^ possible to  ask for any contribution  from Burma.  The straits settlements have  expressed great interest in the project, but in view of the factthat the Is. Od. rate proposed for letters between Europe and Singapore is the sameas,  and not lower than, that now  charged by the Dutch, I do not propose to ask them for more than free facilities and relief from customs dues or a correspondingsubsidy in lieu (payable to Imperial Airways in addition  to the figures given above). If New Zealand, in view of the benefits to be obtained, should be willingto make a  small contribution, it would be divisible between England and  Australiaand be taken in relief of the main subsidies.    10.  An early decision  in principle  is essential  inasmuch as the PrimeMinister of Australia has within the past few days asked for  further information,to assist him in  his present  local negotiations, and I should like to have theauthority  of the  Cabinet before communicating to him by cable the outlines ofour scheme,  as such  communication would  to a certain extent commit us toproceeding  with   the  project if  the many negotiations  now  in  hand provesuccessful.

The United Kingdom will thenbe spending on civil aviation subsidies less than one-tenth of  the corresponding figure in the United States of America; one-quarter of that&quot; in France; about one-third of that in Germany;  and one-half of that in Italy.  Finally it seemsto me unthinkable that we should allow the Dutch to be the first to link Englandand  Australia  by  air;  to do so would surely strike a most damaging blow toour Imperial prestige, and if  this contingency is to be avoided we must.moveearly and with decision.    12.   I ask  therefore Cabinet approval in  principle  to the  continuance of negotiations between all concerned for the early extension to Singapore of imperial airways&apos; existing service to Karachi at a total cost to  the Exchequer of  40,000falling after three years to  20,000 per  annum.
