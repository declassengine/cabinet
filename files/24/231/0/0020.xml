CYPHER TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Dated 21st June, 1932. Received in the Colonial Office at 12.4 p.m., on 21st June, 1932.

No.221.

I much regret that in spite of our unremitting efforts to get them to see reason and of our carrying conciliation to utmost limit leaders have refused to agree to (? withdraw) resignation (corrupt group) unless whole list of demands except number 2 relating ? Hakk? is accepted by 28th June. I have therefore been compelled to ask for movement of Battalion from Egypt to commence tomorrow 22nd June. I am hopeful that arrival of British Troops will be means of inducing sanity all round.
