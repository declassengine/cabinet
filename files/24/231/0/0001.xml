(THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.C-Po 201 (32)                          CABINET.                       EMPLOYMENT COMMI TTEE.                          SECOND REPORT.         1.     The Cabinet will remember that our terms of reference         are &quot;to watch developments,  to co-ordinate departmental         policy, and to submit recommendations for further State         action as may from time to time  seem desirable.&quot;         2.     In our first Report (CP. 138 (32)) we made recommend-         ations to the Cabinet regarding the following schemes :-                Ministry of Labour Training and Re-conditioning                The Proposed Mid-Scotland Canal                The Proposed London Outer-Circle Railway                The Proposed Forth Bridge         These were either proposals which had been submitted to the         former Employment Policy Committee,  or outstanding schemes         on which no final decision had as yet been given.         3.     Assistance to Unemployed  Allotment Holders.         Our first Report referred to,  though it made no recommend-         ation on, the scheme for providing unemployed         allotment holders with seeds,  fertilisers, etc. at cheap         rates.  It will be recalled  that on  the 3rd February         last the Cabinet agreed                &quot;To leave to the Chancellor of the Exchequer                 and the Minister of  Agriculture and                 Fisheries the decision on the following                 recommendation in the  Report of the                 Agricultural Policy  Committee -                                   -1-COPY NO;   U- -S
       &quot;(o) If the Cabinet desire to            reverse the decision not to            make any Government grant            towards the scheme providing            unemployed allotment holders            with seeds, fertilisers, etc.,            at cheap rates, we recommend           - that they should consider the   ;            question of assisting the            Society of Friends on a   for              basis, the Government interest            being watched by a representative            of the Committee administering            the fund.&quot; &quot;                     (Cabinet 11 (32) Conclusion 3(d)).       It was afterwards ascertained that, as a result of anappeal made by the Society of Friends, a  sufficiently largesum of money to cover the expenditure on  the scheme duringthe 1932 Season would probably be subscribed by the public.In view of this and other considerations  the two ministers agreed that the previous decision, namely that no government grant should be made tov^ards the scheme,  should bemaintained so far as the current year was concerned.4.   We now report that we have again examined the scheme with reference to the needs of the employment situation in1933 and the following years.  The majority of our Committeeregard the scheme as constituting a very usefo.1 form ofassistance to the unemployed, and are in favour of government grants on a   for   basis, to be dispensed through the medium of voluntary societies..  We realise that to make provisionfor grants for the 1933 Season would involve the presentation of a Supplementary Estimate before the end of the present financial year.5o     On the other hand, we have been warned by the Treasurythat, in the stringent financial conditions which are likelyto persist for some time, there can bs no assurance that moneywill be available for this purpose; and by the agricultural departments that they are opposed to finding room for it within the limits of their votes on the ground inter alia                              -2-
 that  it  is  an unemployment  and not an agricultural service. They  are likewise unable  to provide  the medium for the distri- bution of the proposed  grants from their  existing staff?  it will  have been  observed,  however, from our  last paragraph, that  those  who  favour the scheme would prefer that the suggested Government assistance  should be dispensed  through voluntary channels. 60     Our  conclusion in  this matter is that, since provision for the present season is  already assured,  there is no  need  to  take action  until October or November next, and then  only after consultation with the voluntary bodies concerned.  A majority  of us are generally  favourable  to assistance  being given  on a   for    basis3  subject to  a maximum  limit. 7.     The  Development  (Loan Guarantees and Grants)       Act, 1929.       The  most important recommendation  which we have to make relates  to  the  position which will arise  in August next on the expiration  of the 1929 Development Act-  It will be recalled that last January the former Employment policy Committee recommended that the Act should be extended  for three years, but that the use to be  made  of the extended powers should be restricted to &quot;schemes calculated to increase the national income, which  are not  likely to ;go  &quot;  - forward  in  the  near future  without some measure of State Assistance&quot;.  The Employment Poliuy  Committee realised that it  was hardly to be expected that many schemes of a genuinely profitable character would be put  forward, but they  were reluctant to  propose the scrapping of a useful piece  of machinery.  This  recommendation was approved by the Cabinet on  the 3rd February (Cabinet  11(32)  Conclusion 6) and announcements were made in the House of Commonc by theMinister  of Labour and his Parliamentary Secretary on the
17th and 25th February and the 3rd March.8.     The present position is that no remunerativework which is capable of acceleration is coming forward as regards Part I of the Act (statutory companies tradingfor profit).  The proposed extension would thus have prac-tical effect as regards Part II only (public utilitiesnot trading for profit and Local Authorities),  thoughhero also there is little activity at present,  LocalAuthorities being as a rule in no position to submitschemeSo  On the other hand  the publicity which would begiven by the passing of a new Act, accompanied by anannouncement as to terms and conditions of grant might give rise to fresh applications.9.     Although the powers under the Development Act are running out, legislation to continue them has not yet been introduced; and the question arises.,, since budgetaryprospects in the immediate future remain doubtful, whetherthe decision of last February should be reviewed.  A Billto continue the Act, accompanied as it must be by themachinery of a Financial Resolution and the publicationof a &quot;tfhite Paper, might well, in existing circumstances,be opposed on grounds of economy by Government supporters in the House of Commons,  On the other hand theintroduction of such a Bill would afford opportunities for pressure in a contrary directions and there mightbe danger of the contemplated restrictions not being fully maintained.       To extend the Act would also, it is argued, run counter to the present demand for economy on rate-borneexpenditureo  It is understood that the Chancellor of                      -4-
the Exchequer has already approached hiscolleagues on the subjects and it would heillogical at the same time to pass an ActAuthorising a further departure from the normalmethods of Local Authority finance.10.    Or. the other hand, the progressiveincrease which it is feared  in many quarterswill occur in both the live  register and  thenumber of unemployed persons subject to themeans test, may produce  a situation in  thecoming auturcn where urgent Government actionin alleviation of distress will be  called foreEmergency legislation may have to be hurriedlydrafted and if the Development Act  has  disappearedin the meantime from the Statute Booh,  it may bedifficult during  the. discussion of  such measuresto keep the finance of the new schemes  withinr e as onab 1 e limits,.11.    Our conclusion is that., while an emergencyof the kind suggested might  make  considerablealterations in unemployment  policy  essential;Government ;?ction at the present  time  should
be based on the first National Government&apos;s policy,  formulated in September 1931, of restricting unnecessary commitments.We are therefore on the whole in favour of allowing the Develop-ment Act to lapse in August next, a course which calls for no positive action by Parliament.120   This reversal of a publicly announced decision will undoubtedly be challenged, and we suggest, in paragraph 31 below,tho general lines on which the change of policy might be defendedin Parliament,   We note also in the same paragraph certainconsequential matters which would require examination,,13o   The Government Building Programme.   We new submit our report on the questions raised in a Memorandum by the first commissioner of Works (0oPo 7 (32))s   it will be rememberedthat the Prime Minister in -January last (Cabinet 1 (32) conclusion) directed the circulation of this paper to the former Employ-ment Policy Committee.14Q   The Memorandum gives the following figures of the programmes for 1931 and  the present year s-                                1931            1932./ H New Works (Vote)           981,675        706,670  4-  3E Maintenance (Vote)       1,432,614      1,291,904  *    Postal Telegraph     and Telephone     Loan                    1,380,000      1,100,800  j6     The First Commissioners estimates for 1932 were framed uponthe principle approved by  the Cabinet that &quot;Departments must be .prepared to consider  the suspension or abolition of manyservices which, however desirable, cannot be regarded as essential in present circumstances&quot;.    The Memorandum, in addition toa Excluding Public Buildings Overseas./ The 1931 and 1932 figures include about  150,000 in    respect of Works under  2,000 in value.4- The final figures as agreed with the Treasury are     756,670 and  1,281,904 reepectively0  This figure is still under discussion with the Treasury.                                 6.
summarising the main items of expenditure on themaintenance of buildings included in the Office ofWorks Vote, shows that the departmental demandscovering the next few years, taken together form a building programme costing upwards of  4 millions,,   Itis explained; however, that even if the various items in the programme were approved, a considerable time would elapse (owing to various difficulties)before the works could be put in hand,,15o   The estimated cost of the suggested developmentof the Montagu House site accounts for some  2millions out of this totalo     We make no reporton this item at present, pending our examination ofa further paper on the subject which the first commissioner is preparing*16o   The other major items in the programme which havebeen brought to our notice are the proposed secondblock at the -Science Museum;    the proposed newpremises for the Royal College of Ar-tj    the proposed new Government Buildings in Edinburgh?   and anumber of new Employment Exchanges,,17c   Regarding the first two of these items, we accept the view of the President of  the Eoard ofEducation that, in present circumstances, neithercan be regarded as a matter of special urgency,18o   The Edinburgh proposal involves certain localdifficulties, and we propote to defer a report upon it
 until we  have  examined  a memorandum which is to be prepared by the First Commissioner  of Works  in consultation with the Secretary of State  for  Scotland. 19.  we are satisfied that the Employment Exchanges building programme for  the current year,  which  is estimated to  cost  200,000, ought not to be increased,  we understand that, although 54  sites which have been acquired for Exchanges  are at present  lying idle, it is hoped to  build  upon  all of them in  either 1932 or 1933, without exceeding the  present rate of expenditure.  We propose to  defer  for the present the  further consideration of the 1953  programme. 20.  Land  Settlement.   We turn  to a consideration of the employment value of the present Land Settlement Policy.   The Government have  decided, owing to the necessity for economy, not to ask Parliament to vote money in 1932 or  1933 for the purposes of the Agricultural Land (Utilisation)  Act,  1931; and Land Settlement is at present administered under the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts. In England and Wales administration is in the hands of the County Councils and the Councils of County Boroughs; in  Scotland it is in the hands of the Department ofAgriculture. 21.  The State&apos;s contribution takes the form of a grant up  to 75 per cent,  of any annual deficiency;  in England and Wales the  average annual contribution per holding from the Exchequer is about  21.   The average capital cost per holding is  -
          in England  and &quot;Wales -  1,300          in Scotland         - a figure varying from                                 1,187 for a &quot;family&quot;                                farm of 50 acres to                                 444 for a 5 acre                                poultry farm.22.   Recent experience in England and Wales has beendiscouraging; although the Councils have been notifiedthat they can continue to submit schemes, the majority-are said to be doing  little  in the direction of acquiringfresh land.  During  the past five years contributions have been made to an average of only about &amp;00 holdingsper annum, although  the last two years have seen some increase,  It is feared that the men settled are rarelydrawn from the ranks of the unemployed., and that, while it mightbe desirable on other grounds to stimulate County councils to provide more holdings, little direct effect on the unemployment situation could be anticipated.23.   On the other hand,  we are informed that experience in Scotland has been more hopeful,  and that the bulk of theDepartment of Agriculture&apos;s tenants are in a satisfactoryposition.  The percentage of failures to the total ofsettlers has fallen from 14.3 per cent, in 1920 to nil in 1930 and1931.   The number of applications for holdings is reportedto be on the increase (65y  in 1931 as compared with 390in 1927) and the demand is  unlikely to be satisfied forsome time.24.   We do not,  however,  think it  possible,  havingregard to the  very uncertain financial outlook,  to contemplate any reversal  of last autumn&apos;s decision.
to restrict expenditure on Land Settlement  schemes.25*   Land Drainage.    The position as regardsarterial drainage is  that the programmes of 1926,  1928,1929 and 1930 provided for Government grants to drainageauthorities, to County Councils and, in certain cases,to County Borough Councils.  At the time of the financialemergency of 1931 a considerable number of schemes werein operation;  the Government decided, however, to sanction no further schemes and to curtail existing schemes as far as possible.26c     The programme under Section 55 of the land drainage Act, 1930, contemplated the carrying out (withthe aid of Government grants) of schemes of considerablemagnitude by the new type  of drainage authority, namely,catchment boards,  constituted by the A4.ct.  At the time ofthe financial emergency  of 1931 not more than one or two schemes under this Section had  come into operation;  itwas decided, since it was  realised  that if no government grant were  available wide-spread damage might occasionallyoccur, that while  the  facilities afforded by this Sectionmust be generally  suspended, applications for government assistance  in cases of  the strictest  emergency might still be considered.  For  this purpose  25,000 is provided in the estimates for the current year, from which onlyone grant has so far been made.27.     \7e  understand  that the  catchment boards
have, up to the present, had little time for the formulation of schemes and are,  for the most part,engaged in preliminary reviews of the practical problemsof their districts,28.     The scheme of field drainage grants to landowners and occupiers which was authorised &quot;by theLabour Government in August 1929 was adversely criticised by the May Committee.  It was accordingly decided lastyear that no further grants were to be made under thisScheme in England and Wales.  In Scotland the Scheme isbeing continued for the present year, but the rate of grant has been reduced from 33^ per cent, to 25 per cent.29.     It is claimed that in Scotland the  employment valueof field drainage  is high and that an  expenditure of 1,000 on field drainage provides, directly or  indirectly,employment for 11  men, whereas it  is usually estimated  that other forms of relief work of high employment value, suchas road works, only  employ about 4 men directly and indirectly for an  expenditure of  1000 for  the  same period.Arterial drainage, on the other hand,  is  said to have acomparatively  small  employment value.30.     Our general  conclusion regarding Land Drainageis that the financial situation doe3 not permit of a reversal of the decisions arrived  at in 1931.
12 e31.   SlRltARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND REOOMMENDAT10113.      We accordingly report to the Cabinet as  follows  :-The Development Act.      (a) That the renewal of the Development  (Loan          guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929 is not          desirable in present financial circumstances;      (b) that the best course for the Minister of Labour,          when questioned on the matter, will be to say          that the Government have been led to reconsider          their decision by the lack of practical results          from the Act since his announcement  of the          previous February;  and thatthafer conclusion Is          that the usefulness of the Act is exhausted and          its renewal would be of no material  benefit in          dealing with the preset phase of the unemployment          situation;  he might also make clear that the          whole unemployment position is under constant and          continuous examination.      (c) that, if  the Cabinet approve the recommendation          under (a) the following consequential matters          (which, it is understood, do not give rise to          difficulty) will require  to be cleared up.          (i) the continuance of payment in respect of              grants already made under the Act;         (ii) the treatment of the problems which will              frequently arise In respect of schemes now              in operation, e.g., demands for  the alter-              ation of conditions of grant;        (iii) the question of retaining all rr part of              the more expeditious Private Bill procedure              introduced under the Public Works Facilities              Act, 1930;  consultation between the Treasury              and the Ministry of Labour will  be desirable              before any decision is reached.The Government Building Programme,      (d) that the Science Museum and Royal College of          Art projects cannot be considered to be          matters of special urgency.      (e) that no change should be made in the Employment          Exchange building programme figure of  200,000          for 1932-33, and that the consideration of the          figure for 1933-34 should be postponed until  )          the autumn.      (f) that a recommendation on  the question of the          Montagu House site will be included in our next          Report.     (g)   that we have requested the First Commissioner          of Works5 in consultation with the Secretary          of State for Sc;tland? to prepare a          Memorandum for the Edinburgh public  buildings0
Signed on behalf of the Committee  SNOWDSNChairman.Whitehall Gardens, SoW.1.   13th June, 19320Allotment Gardens for the Unemployed.     (h) that, while we are generally favourable to         the proposal that assistance should be         given in aid of voluntary effort on a           for   basis, subject to a maximum limit,         we consider that no action on the matter         should be taken until October or November         next, and then only after consultation with         the voluntary bodies concerned.Land Settlement.      (i) that in view of the financial situation,          the economy decisions reached last autumn in          regard to schemes of land settlement for          the unemployed should be maintained.Land Drainage.,      (j) that, in view of the financial situation,          the economy decisions reached last autumn          in regard to Land Drainage (Arterial and          Field) should be maintained.
