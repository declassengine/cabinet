11*     The morning  sitting  was devoted to a discussion on the  question of  the Oath,, and the afternoon sitting  to the  question of the Land Annuities.12.     After the  Prime Minister had welcomed Mr. de valera, the latter indicated that he presumed that no useful purpose could &quot;be served &quot;by his discussing thetwo &quot;fundamentals&quot; to which  he had referred at themeeting in Dublin  on June 7th. (See I8S.C.(3S) 26).Nevertheless he proceeded3 for about a quarter of an hour, to develop his ideas as  to these5 on the same lines as in Dublin.13.     After he had finished, the Prime Minister saidthat, in his view, no useful purpose could be served &quot;bydiscussing these &quot;fundamentals&quot; since the BritishGovernment could not possibly  entertain cither.14o     Mr. De Valera then proceeded to describe indetail the position which he took -up with regard to the oath.  His chief points were     (l) that the  Treaty Settlement of 1921 had been         obtained by duress;     (2) thatj according to  the true construction of         the Treaty5 the Oath  was not mandatory;     (3) that even if the Oath were mandatory in 1921 s         the &quot;position had been altered by the         constitutional developments resulting from         the Imperial Conferences of 1926 and 1930         under which the Dominions had been given         equality  of status  with the UoK.  As the
         result of these constitutional developments         anything inconsistent with the principle of         equality of  status had been waived;,  The oath         was  inconsistent with equality of status0      (4) the people of  the  oF0S.  could not possibly         accept a compulsory 0atho  Personally he         would be prepared to die  rather  than agree to         such a positions      Of the above points,, Mr0 De Valera laid greateststress on  (3) .15o     Mr0 Thomas then replied to Kr0 De Valera&apos;s con-contentions especially on  the subject of the mandatorycharacter of the Oatho  He quoted  in particular thediscussions in the Dail in October 1922 which showedclearly that the view then taken was that the Oath wasobligatory,,   (See I.a.3oC.0(32) 19, pages 19 - 24) 016o     Discussion on the question cf the Oath went on for some little tiin.es and at one period the questionemergeds and indeed assumed considerable proportionsswhether the I0P,Se Government would be prepared, to acceptarbitration on the question whether the Oath was or wasnot, ohligatory under the treaty  Mro Thomas made a strongplea to Mr0 De Valera to consider this, though the discus-sion was so conducted that no definite offer of arbitrationwas made on behalf of the U0K&amp; Government0170     Mr0 De Valera saids hov^ever3 that he could not possibly agree to arbitration on the question of the manda-tory character of the Oaths and by the end of the morning the Conference had broken down?  so far as the question ofthe Oath was concernedoISo     After luncheon a discussion on the question of theLand Annuities took place,  Mr0  De Valera developed, inconsiderable detail his position with regard to the
Annuities *. laying stress, in particular, on the contention that Mr. Cosgrave had no authority tohind, the I,PoS, by the 1923 document (i.e. Cmd.4061) which had been kept secret from the Dail.19.   The case on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment was then put, by Mr. Thomas, and therewas some very plain speaking, MrB De Valerasaying that he did not intend to make the paymentnext falling due, and Mre Thomas  &quot;being equallyemphatic that it must and should be paid.20.   When the question of arbitration came tobe discussed&apos;. Mr6 De Valera said that any arbit-ratlon could not bo confined to the Annuities.His people would not agree to arbitrate on oneisolated is sue arising out of the complicatedfinancial arrangements resulting from the TreatySettlement,-   His Government would have to bring in the whole question of their financial relationswith the United Kingdom.21.   Lord Hailsham then asked whether Mr, de valera meant arbitration as to &quot;legal liabilityon agreements made as to payments other than the annuities&quot; or whether he meant that  some outsideperson should be asked to decide, apart altogether from agreements alreadv made, what would be a  fiar&apos;  V&apos;                                    &apos;             Jfinancial settlement between the  two countries.22.   Mr* De Valera said that he meant the latter,and referred in this connection to Article 5 of theTreaty.
33.     The Prime Minister then said that the represent-atives of the British Government hod come to the meetingprepared only to discuss two specific points, namely the oath and the Annuities, and that they could not embark on wider discussions.34.     Mr. De Valera was then given, on behalf of theU.E.  Government, a document which ho could take back tothe I.F.a.  with him.    This document stated in effect.        (a) that the U,K,  Government maintained their            attitude with regard to the Oath9 and        (h) that, ae regards the Annuities, the U.K.            Government offered to refer the question            to arbitration by an Empire tribunal in            accordance with Section 6 (d) (pages ^2-24)            of the summary of Proceedings of th-            Imperial Conference of 1930  (Cmd,3717).35,     When the meeting termine ted, both the Prime Ministerand Mr. De Valera said that they hoped that this was nottne last word,   At the same time neither w..s able, to see away out,33.     It should be added that, in a subsequent informal discussion with hr, De Valera when driving to Euston on his departure, Mr. Thomas mentioned that he would have to make astatement In the House of Commons on June 13th,   he enquiredof Mr.  De Valera whether he could say that  &apos;a farther commun-icstion would be received from the president of the ExecutiveCouncil after consultation with is colls colleagues&quot; or words to;that effect, without committing him or causing him embarrass-ment.27-.     Mr, De Valera answered in the affirmative.   when mr. Thomas tentatively enquired whether  the further commun-publication promised by Mr. De Valeru might perhaps  involveanother- meeting, Mr- De Valera would not commit himself,,                           -6-
28.     Lastly it should he recorded that, just as hewas leaving  Buston, Mr.  De Vilera told Mr.  Thomas that,in the circumstances, he was doubtful whether the I.v.o.would send a delegation to the Ottawa Conference,.   it did not seem to him that.such a delegation would be worthwhilej since the I.F.S.  had no trade relations with theother Dominions of sufficient importance to justify taking part in the Conference if there was no prospect of anarrangemsnt with the U.H.                    &quot; (Intdj J. H. T.Dominions Office,   14th June, 193a.
