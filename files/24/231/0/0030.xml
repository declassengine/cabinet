Q -----                                               COPY NO-^                     p.. A BINE T ..         EEVELOPIIENT (LOAN GUARANTEES  &amp; GRANTS) ACT.  1939,Note by the. Lord President of the Council,        On the 15th instant, the Cabinet approved the con-elusions and recommendations in the second Report of theEmployment Committee (CaP.201(32)) subject to an enquirybeing made in regard to the effect of non-renewal of theDevelopment (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act. 19 29, on schemessuch as the twenty ton railway wagon scheme.        The Great Western Railway twenty ton railway wagonscheme which was recommended for grant by the Lewis Committeeis at present under consideration by the Chancellor of theExchequer.   If it is decided to approve the grant in this case the necessary authority can be given before the expiry of the existing powers under the Act.        There are no present Indications that any similarscheme is likely to be put forward by ether Railway companies and the Lewis Committee have no other substantial schemes ofeconomic value before them which can be put into execution inthe near future.        Since the announcement by the Minister of Labour onthe 17th February last, only three applications, with a total value of less than  20,000, have been received by the Committeeand all three have been rejected by them as not satisfying theordinary conditions of grant.        It is convenient to deal in this note with the three points referred to by the Employment Committee as matters whichwould require to be cleared up if the Act is not extended.                            - 1 -r-
      (a) Continuance of payment in respect of grants .already made.   It is understood that this refers to thequestion of excess grants where works have proved more costly than the approved estimate,    The Treasury holdsthe view that in such cases the excess should normallyhe the responsibility of the undertakers0   They realisePhowever, that there may be exceptional cases where excess                            fmust be recognised for grant purposes and they see nodifficulty in dealing with such excesses, notwithstanding that the Act will have expired when the excesses come tolightc      (b) Alterations of conditions of grants.   Theconditions of grants are operative during the construction,and possibly during the whole period of payment on accountof grants.    The Treasury sees no difficulty in making any necessary adjustments throughout these periodsG   A similarpoint has arisen in the case of earlier Acts which have ex-pired and has not given rise to difficulty,      (c) Position of tho Public Works Facilities Act 1950.The continuance of this Act is a separate matter from thecontinuance of the Development Act and a decision on theformer Act is not automatically involved in the decision onthe latter,,   The question appears to be one for discussion between the appropriate Departments before the next expiring laws Continuance Bill.      This note has been agreed with the Ministries ofHealth, Labour and Transport.                         (Intld, ) B.B.                                  27,6. 32o
