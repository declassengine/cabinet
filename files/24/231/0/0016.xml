PRINCIPLES OF EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  ROYAL  AIR  FORCE        IN IRAQ ON THE COMING  INTO  FORCE OF THE ANGLO-        IRAQ TREATY, 1930.                        (C.I.D. Paper No.  1088-B.)    THE COMMITTEE  had under consideration  a  letter  from the  ColonialOffice covering a despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq, setting out thegeneral principles of employment of the Royal Air Force in Iraq on the cominginto force of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930.    SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER, at the request of the Prime Minister,explained to the Committee that the important points in connection with  theemployment of the Royal Air  Force were contained in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 ofthe Colonial Office covering letter.  The object of the  safeguards proposed was toensure that the Royal Air Force would not be  used except in case of real necessityfor the defence of British lives, and also that  the Royal Air Force should take no action  in case of internal  disorder without  a written request from the IraqGovernment through our Ambassador,  who should in each case satisfy  himself that the employment proposed for the Royal Air Force was suitable.   In extremeeases it might, of course, be necessary  for the Air Officer Commanding to take immediate action, but he thought that in all circumstances the proposed procedure would give us the best security possible.    SIR JOHN SIMON said he thought the proposals were eminently suitable,especially in view of the very experienced source from which they had emanated.    THE PRIME MINISTER proposed that the Papers should be forwarded to the Cabinet with the recommendation that the proposed principles of employ-ment of the Royal Air Force in Iraq should be accepted as the basis of our defence policy in that country.                               Conclusions.    The Committee of Imperial Defence  agreed     (a) To approve the proposed general principles of employment of the Royal           Air Force in Iraq on the coming into force of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty           of 1930.    (6) To forward the Papers concerned to  the Cabinet with the recommendations  -           tion that these proposals should be accepted as the basis of our defence           policy  in Iraq.        *          *           *          *          *          *    2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1,           June 9, 1932.[7143-6]

General Principles of Employment of the Royal Air Force in Iraq on the             Coming into Force of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930.Letter from the Colonial Office covering a Despatch from the High  Commissioner                                  for Iraq.[No.  96489/32.]Sir,                                       downing  Street, March 11, 1932.    I AM directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to transmit to you,.to be  laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence, a copy of a despatch fromthe High Commissioner for Iraq,  suggesting certain general principles  whichshould govern the employment of the Royal Air Force in Iraq on the coming intoforce  of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930.  It will be within the knowledge  of theCommittee that this Treaty will  not become operative until  Iraq has become amember of the League of Nations, and the mandatory relationship between this.country and Iraq has thus terminated.  It is the intention that Iraq should seekadmission to the League of Nations in September 1932.    An extract from the Treaty (and Military Annexure) containing the Articlesmost  closely affecting  the  questions  discussed  in  the High  Commissioners-despatch, is appended to this letter for facility of reference.    2.  As a  preliminary  to  bringing the matter  before  the Committee  ofImperial Defence, the Secretary of State for the  Colonies caused a  meeting ofrepresentatives of the Colonial Office,  Foreign Office and Air Ministry to  beheld,  to examine, in consultation with Sir Francis Humphrys, the  proposals putforward  in the accompanying despatch.    3.  The  general view of the meeting, which was held on the 22nd October,1931,  was that, subject to certain modifications of detail which will be mentionedlater  in  this  letter, paragraphs  3, 4,  5 and  6  of the despatch might, with advantage, be adopted as a basis for instructions governing the use of the  RoyalAir Force in Iraq, to be issued to His Majesty&apos;s Representative in Baghdad whenthe Treaty of 1930 enters into force.    4.  The Interdepartmental meeting was in agreement with the view advanced in paragraph 4 (b)  of  the  despatch that, having  regard to the  provisions  ofArticle 5 of the Treaty, which places the whole responsibility for the maintenanceof internal order upon the Iraqi Government, the Royal Air Force should not beemployed for the suppression of disorder in cases where there was  no  immediatedanger to British or foreign lives or interests, except upon a request  in writing&quot;from  the Iraqi Government to the British Ambassador.    Some doubt was expressed, however, whether intervention by the  Royal AirForce to suppress internal disorder which,  although potentially dangerous, didnot constitute an immediate threat to British or foreign lives or interests, couldbe defended unless it could be shown that the disorder had not  been  occasioned&apos;or provoked  by oppression or maladministration on the  part  of  the  Iraqiauthorities, or, failing  that, unless undertakings  of redress  had been obtained       [6721]                                                      bSECRET.1088-B.
from the Iraqi Government.  It was felt that, apart from its intrinsic value, some such  safeguard would be desirable in order to meet possible criticism that theRoyal Air Force was being used as the instrument of Oriental tyranny and mis-government.     5.  On the other hand, it was represented that the existence of maladmini-stration would be difficult to establish, that an attempt to obtain undertakings in advance from the Iraqi Government would lead to controversy and delay, andthat, if allowed to spread, the disorder might assume dimensions that would ultimately call for much more drastic action on the part of the Royal  Air Forcethan would be necessary if it had been checked in its incipient stages.   In all thecircumstances it was decided to recommend that the wording of the last sentence of paragraph 4 (b) should stand, but that the Ambassador should be  instructedto satisfy  himself in  every  case  in which British interests were not  directlythreatened, that the Royal Air Force were not used in support of governmentaloppression or the introduction of unpopular innovations.    6.  While fully realising that it was highly important that the Ambassadorsconcurrence should, if possible, be obtained in every case before action was takenby the Royal Air Force, since, in nearly every instance,  this would imply thatthe concurrence of the Iraqi Prime Minister had  also been obtained, the viewof the Interdepartmental meeting was that  it would  be undesirable  to  excludealtogether  the possibility of the  Air Officer Commanding taking action in thecircumstances envisaged  in  paragraph 4 (c)  of the despatch, without obtaining the prior concurrence of the Ambassador.   It was, therefore, agreed to recommendthat there should be inserted at the end of the first sentence of paragraph 4  (c)  ofthe despatch  the following clause :          &quot; . .  . .  except  in  extreme cases Avhere there is  immediate danger  to    British life, and where it has proved  impossible for the necessary communica-    tion between  the Ambassador and the Air  Officer  Commanding to  be    established in time/&apos;    7.  Although, as explained in the first paragraph  of this letter, the  issue  of instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Representative in Baghdad regarding the  employ-ment of the Royal Air Force, is not a  matter of immediate urgency, I am  tosuggest that  this matter  should  be  brought before the Committee of ImperialDefence for their consideration when a suitable opportunity occurs, in order thatthe proposed instructions  may be in  the possession of the British Representativebefore the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930 enters into force.                                             I  am,  &amp;c.                                                 A. C. C. PARKINSON.                             ENCLOSURE No. 1.Despatch from High Commissioner for Iraq to the  Secretary of State for the                                  Colonies.                                              The  Residency,My Lord,                                          Baghdad, May 29, 1931.    I  HAVE  been considering  the  question  of  the general  principles whichshould govern  the employment of the Royal Air Force in Iraq on the cominginto force of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, and  have  the honour  to submit the following  tentative  proposals  which  may  perhaps  serve  as  a  basis  of-discussion when I come to London.    2.  Apart from military co-operation with the Iraqi  forces in time of war or menace of war, with  which I do not propose to deal, the question  of theemployment of the Royal Air Force  appears  to me to fall naturally  under thefollowing heads :          (a) Repelling raiders from across the frontier.         (b) Restoring internal  order.         (c) Protection of British subjects  and British commercial interests.         (d) Protection of other foreign subjects and commercial interests.         (e) Protection of Imperial air communications and self-defence.
Before  discussing these in detail it may be desirable to consider the general question  of  the  channel  through  which  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  willcommunicate their decisions as to the employment of the  Royal Air Force.    3.  I assume that the British Ambassador will have no direct authority overthe Royal Air Force in Iraq and will not be titular  Commander-in-Chief,  asthe High Commissioner is at present.  The Air Officer Commanding will  thus be responsible solely to the Air Ministry and  not to the  Ambassador.  At thesame  time it will  clearly be  necessary  for the  closest  possible  touch to  bemaintained between the Embassy and Air Headquarters  and it should I thinkbe laid down as a guiding principle  that the Air Officer Commanding, whateverauthority may be delegated to him by  the Air Ministry to sanction the employmentof the Royal Air Force, will in no  case  exercise  it without prior consultationwith the Ambassador, or, in the event of  the Ambassador not sharing his views as to its necessity, until the question has been referred to  the Foreign Office andthe Air Ministry.  The  only case in which it appears possible that this principlemight in cases of extreme urgency be waived is case (e), which will be discussed later.    4.  To turn now to the five heads enumerated in paragraph 2  :      (a)  Repelling Raiders from across the Frontier.        Article 5 of the  Treaty of 1930 provides that  responsibility  for  the    defence of Iraq from external aggression rests with  His Majesty the King    of Iraq,  subject to  the provisions of  Article  4.  Article 4 deals only with    war or the imminent menace of  war, and it follows therefore that the Iraqi    Government  are solely responsible for the defence of Iraq from external    raids. This does not rule out the possibility of their asking  for the  help    of the Royal Air  Force, but it does rule  out independent action by  the    Royal Air Force.   It should therefore be laid down as a guiding principle    that except in cases which may  arise  under heads (c), (d) and  (e)  below the    Royal Air Force should  not be  employed except upon a request in  writing    from  the Iraqi Government to  the Ambassador.   I  consider that such a    request should only be complied  with  if the Ambassador and the Air Officer    Commanding are satisfied that  the Iraqi Government have fully consulted    the Head of the British Military Mission, and that  the latter agrees  that    every possible step  has been taken by the  Iraqi  Government  to  repel  the    raiders with their  own  forces,  and that Royal Air Force co-operation is-    essential.    (b)  Restoring Internal Order.        Article 5 of the Treaty of  1930 provides  that  responsibility  for  the    maintenance of internal  order in Iraq rests with His Majesty the King  of    Iraq.   Independent action by the Royal Air  Force is therefore ruled  out,    and it should be laid down as a guiding principle that except in cases which    may arise under heads (c), (d) and (e) below, the  Royal  Air Force should    not be employed except upon a request in writing from the Iraqi Government    to the Ambassador.  I consider that no such request should  be complied    with  in  any  circumstances, unless  the Ambassador  or  the   Air Officer    Commanding considers that inaction  will precipitate or aggravate a  state    of affairs which will call  for action  under heads  (c), (d)  or  (e).   In  this    event they should consult together and  submit their views for the instructions    of His Majesty&apos;s Government, unless they agree that immediate action falling    within the procedure outlined below is indispensable.    (c) Protection of British Subjects and British Commercial Interests.        If the employment of the Royal Air Force is essential in order to protect    the  lives  of British subjects, I consider that it should be taken even if the    Iraqi Government do not agree,  and even without consulting them in cases    of extreme urgency,  but as I have said in paragraph 3 above, no action should    be taken  without the prior concurrence of the  Ambassador.  The Royal  Air    Force should not be employed for the defence of British commercial interests,    if there is no question of&quot;saving the lives of British subjects, except at the      [6721]                                                     B  2
    request of  the Ambassador,  who  should  if  possible  obtain  the  prior    concurrence of His Majesty&quot;s Government.    (d) Protection of other Foreign Subjects and Commercial Interests.        The Royal Air Force will not in my opinion have the same direct moral    responsibility for protecting the lives of other foreign subjects as they will    have for those of British subjects, and I am inclined to the view that they    should  only be employed for this  purpose  at the request of the  Iraqi    Government and with  the prior  concurrence of the Ambassador..  In  the    event of a foreign representative appealing direct  to the Ambassador for    action to be taken in cases of extreme urgency, either  because the  Iraqi    Government refuse to make the request, or because  time  does not admit of    their  being  consulted, the Ambassador must use his discretion whether to    concur  in  the employment of  the  Royal  Air Force, if  the  Air Officer    Commanding sees no objection, or to refer to His Majesty&apos;s Government    for instructions.  The  Royal Air Force should not be  employed  for  the    defence of other foreign commercial interests, if there  is no  question of    saving lives, except under instructions from Flis Majesty&apos;s Government on    the representation either of the Ambassador or of the foreign Government    concerned.    (e)  Protection of Imperial Communications and Self-Defence.        The Air Officer Commanding must of course have unfettered responsi-    bility for the safety  of his forces and of his line of communications.  If    the air-bases are in actual danger, or being attacked whether by raiders or    rebels, he must have  a  completely free hand to take such action as may be    necessary for their defence.  I do not know to what extent an-air base is    dependent upon land or sea communication.  Assuming,  however,  that the    air-bases in Iraq  will  contain reserves  of rations, fuel and ammunition    which will enable them to hold out for some  stated period,  I should deprecate    the employment of  the Royal  Air Force merely  for  the  defence or    re-establishment of communications before  the Ambassador had been  given    an opportunity of expressing his views and consulting the Iraqi  Government    if the threat came from raiders or rebels.    .5.  The suggestions  made  in this despatch  are intended  to cover anyemployment of the Royal Air Force which falls outside the  activities  contem-plated in  the Treaty of 1930.  I should perhaps add here that in my  opinion the employment of the Royal Air  Force in the circumstances  discussed  above should be limited as far  as possible  to measures which cause no loss  of life,and that air action in  the  accepted sense of the term should only  be taken inthe last resort and should then be subject  to  the same general principles asgovern its use by the Royal  Air  Force in Iraq under present conditions.    6.  There remains  one contingency which has not yet been discussed.   Thisis that some change of  the Iraqi Government or successful rebellion throughoutIraq may produce a state of affairs in which  reliance  cannot be placed uponthe continued friendliness and  co-operation of the Iraqi authorities.   This isa situation  for which it is necessary to be prepared, but the detailed discussionof which  does not appear necessary  at this stage.  It could not arise  without warning,  and the measures which  would have  to be taken in order to  meet itwould in  any case require  consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in thelight  of a number of factors which it is quite  impossible at  present to foresee.                                            I  have, &amp;c.                                    (Signed)       F.,H. HUMPHRYS,                                              High Commissioner for Iraq.

Should, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 above, either of the HighContracting Parties become engaged in wrar, the other High Contracting party will, subject always to the provisions of Article 9  below, immediately come tohis aid in the capacity of  an ally.   In the  event of an imminent menace  ofwar, the High Contracting Parties will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence.  The aid of His Majesty the  King of Iraq in  the event ofAvar or  the imminent menace of war will consist in furnishing to His BritannicMajesty on Iraq territory all facilities and  assistance in his power, including theuse of railways, rivers, ports, aerodromes and means of communication.

It  is understood between the High Contracting Parties that responsibilityfor the maintenance of internal order in Iraq, and, subject to the provisions ofArticle 4 above, for  the defence of Iraq from external aggression, rests with HisMajesty the King of Iraq.  Nevertheless, His Majesty the King of Iraq recognises that the permanent  maintenance and protection,  in  all circumstances,  of  theessential communications of His Britannic Majesty   is in the common interest ofthe High Contracting Parties. For this purpose and in order to facilitate thedischarge of the obligations of His Britannic Majesty under Article  4 above, HisMajesty the King of Iraq undertakes to grant to Flis Britannic Majesty, for the-duration of the  Alliance, sites for air  bases to be selected by His  BritannicMajesty at or in the vicinity of Basra, and for an air  base to be selected by HisBritannic Majesty to the west of  the Euphrates.  His Majesty the King of Iraqfurther authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain forces upon Iraq territoryat the above localities in accordance with the provisions of the Annexure of this treaty, on the understanding that the presence of those forces shall not constitutein any manner an occupation  and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rightsof Iraq.         *           *           *          *          *          *                                 ARTICLE 9.

for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the twenty-seventh day of August,.One thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight.(2)        *           *           *           *           *           *                                 ARTICLE 11.        w           ^           JX&apos;           4t           ^           4r    The present Treaty shall remain in force for a period of twenty-five years from the date of its coming into force.  At any time after twenty years from thedate of the coming into force of this Treaty, the High Contracting Parties will,at the request of either of them,  conclude a new Treaty which shall provide forthe continued maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essentialcommunications of His  Britannic Majesty.    In case of disagreement  in thismatter the difference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.        ******                       A nneooure to Treaty of A lliance.
