THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1932.SECRET.Copy No.   9CP.  237  (32).CABINET.TRAWLING IN THE  MORAY FIRTH AND THE FIRTH  OF CLYDE.     MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    AT their meeting on the 11th February (Cabinet Conclusions 13  (32) ) theCabinet decided-     (1)  That  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  should  accept  the   invitation- to-          participate  in  the  International  Conference  proposed  by  the          Netherlands Government.                                   ....    (2)  That while the Secretary  of State for Scotland should be at  liberty to          suggest to the Netherlands Government the addition to the Agenda          for the Conference of the question of requiring foreign fishermen to&apos;          observe the restrictions for the time  being applied by His Majesty&apos;s          Government to British fishermen in  the Moray Firth and  the Firth          of Clyde, British participation in the proposed Conference should not          be made conditional on the acceptance in principle of this policy.    (3)  That in view of the differences of opinion on this question, arrangements-          should  be  made  to provide  for separate  representation  at the          Conference of England and Wales and Scotland  respectively. :   -    I considered that there were considerable objections to these decisions whichwere taken  in my  absence, and  I communicated my objections  to the .PrimeMinister in a minute dated the 23rd February.  The matter was further considered.by the Cabinet on the 24th February (Cabinet Conclusions 15 (32)  ) whemit^wasdecided  that a Cabinet Committee should examine the  question and  report tothe Cabinet.  About the same time,  the  Secretary of  State for  Scotland  sentto the Prime Minister a minute commenting on my minute. The Prime Ministerwrote the  following minute on  the  minute  of the  Secretary  of  State;,forScotland :                                                ,          . . ,:..        1&apos; The policy has been settled by the Cabinet and should not be reopened    unless some serious point arises.   The technique  of  the  negotiations should    be  settled with the Foreign  Office and brought  to the  Cabinet only if    insuperable difficulty arises.&quot;    In the absence  of the Prime Minister, owing to illness,  the Lord Presidentof the Council suggested that I should confer with the Secretary of  State for5Scotland with a view, if possible, to  reaching some settlement of the  questions at issue which would  obviate the necessity  for further consideration of  those questions either by  the Cabinet Committee which was appointed at the meetingon the 24th February, or by the Cabinet itself.                       ; v    I then  had interviews with the  Secretary  of  State for Scotland and&apos; theMinister for Agriculture and Fisheries at  which it was not possible  to arrive&apos;&apos;at a final agreement, and,  in myi absence, an official letter  was  sent&apos; froiri the1Foreign Office to the Scottish Office, the Admiralty, the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries, and  the  Dominions Office,  adhering to the objections which hadalready  been pointed out, more particularly to  point 2 of the  Cabinet decision      6458   [7242]
of the  1.1th  February,  agreement having  previously beein reached  between  the&quot;&apos;.Secretary of State for Scotland and myself on the points of technique.     On the 3rd May the Secretary  of State for  Scotland wrote me a letter inwhich he gave his reasons for considering that there did not appear to be  any outstanding question within the. terms of the Prime Ministers minute, and thatthe Foreign Office were reopening a question on which the Cabinet had already-come to a decision.     On the 17th May,  I replied  to the Secretary of State for Scotland that thepolicy had  been  settled in  my absence, and that the Prime Minister&apos;s minuterecognised that the policy might have to be reopened if the difficulties of carryingit out could not be overcome.   The minute directed that  there  should be noreopening unless some serious point arose, but I was afraid that the point underdiscussion was a serious one.  I should, however, prefer to  co-operate with theSecretary of State  for  Scotland  in seeing whether an agreed note  could not be approved  by  the other  interested   Departments.   I attach a  copy  of  this draft note.     The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Board  of Trade,  and theAdmiralty  were, however,  unable to concur  in the terms of this  note.   TheScottish Office concurred in the note  subject to minor  alterations,.and remarked,with regard to the  letters  which these Departments had sent  to the ForeignOffice, that they substantially repeat the arguments which  were  put by those departments  at  the  Cabinet meeting  on  the 11th  February, and  therefore asthe  object of the draft note was to carry out that decision, the necessity forcommenting further on them appears to be superseded.     In view of the difference of  opinion which  still unfortunately  exists on  thissubject, I have no  alternative but to ask  that  it may be further considered bythe Cabinet at a  meeting at which I am able to  be present.                                                           JOHN SIMON.     Foreign Office,  June 29, 1932                     Draft Note to Netherlands Minister.Sir,                                               Foreign Office,   , 1932.     I have the honour to  inform  you that His Majesty&apos;s   Government in the United Kingdom have  given  their careful consideration  to the invitation which you were so good as to convey to them on behalf of the Netherlands Government inyour note No.  622 of the 22nd May,  1931, to attend a conference at The Hagueto revise the International  Convention Regulating the Police of the North sea fisheries of the 6th May, 1882.   I am now able  to inform you that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will have much pleasure in  taking part  in the revision of theconvention, and that they agree  that the points enumerated  in your note underreply are suitable for discussion.     2.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government desire, however, that the position with regardto trawling in the Moray  Firth and the Firth of Clyde should  be taken  intoconsideration on this occasion.  As  you are doubtless aware, trawling in these areas is prohibited  in  pursuance of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889. Since 1907, however,  the  prohibition has  not been enforced against  foreigntrawlers.  Although foreign  trawlers are prevented from landing  their catches in the United Kingdom, they enjoy, in the circumstances, a privilege over British trawlers by admission  to the firths.   Their admission  arouses great complaint from the local fishermen, and His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that these complaintsare  not without justification.     3.  His Majesty&apos;s Government desire, therefore,  that  the agenda of  theconference should  include  the  question of the  signatories  of  the  North  Sea Convention agreeing that their trawlers should be subject to the same restrictions as those imposed by the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889,  on British trawlers.     4.  I should be greatly obliged if you would be so good  as to  inform me, in due course, whether this proposed addition to the agenda of the conference would be agreeable to the other Governments concerned
