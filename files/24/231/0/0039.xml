TO BE RETURNED TO THE SECRETARYOF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL defence. WHITEHALL.

AS the result of a  discussion at the  254th Meeting of the Committee of&quot;Imperial Defence on the 7th December, 1931, we were appointed a Sub-committee with the following terms of reference :          &quot;To  examine   the  whole Coast  Defence situation;  in  particular,.    developments resulting from the introduction of Air forces, with a view to    making recommendations for improving the security of the defended ports    throughout the Empire.&quot;    2.  We have received and carefully considered a large amount of information on this subject from the Defence Departments and the Committee of ImperialDefence.  We have discussed the matter separately with the Chief of  Staff ofeach of the Defence Services.     3.  In  order  to provide a  basis  for  our inquiry,  the  Secretary  to  theCommittee of Imperial Defence prepared a comprehensive synopsis of the workof the Committee and its Sub-Committees on Coast Defence since the War.  he also supplied us with  copies of a Memorandum dealing with the principles onwhich the existing schemes for revision of our coast defences have been based(OLD. Paper No. 308-C).     4.  We do not  propose to overload this Report with a summary of these principles, with which the members of  the Committee of Imperial Defence  are either familiar or in a position to refresh their memory.  The only point whichwe would recall is one that  differentiates our own system  from that of othercountries (except possibly the United States of America), namely, that our coast defences  are based on  the assumption that we possess general  command of  thesea; that an enemy  fleet or ship bent on attacking our ports will be aware thatsooner or later he is  liable to be brought to action and cannot afford to be caughtat a disadvantage;   and that the  object of our coast  defences,  namely, to deteran enemy ship from attacking our ports,  is subject to the above considerations.The amount of the  deterrent required varies, of course, according to the time that the port may have to hold out before relief can arrive, and to the scale of attack to be expected, and reaches its maximum at ports in the Far East, where,in normal times of peace, we do  not maintain a fleet comparable with that of japan.   Singapore,  in particular, is  a key, port  of unique importance,  and throughout our inquiry we have tested the evidence by its bearing on the defenceof that base.     5. Before leaving the principles of coast defence we must mention that  theChief of the Air Staff has suggested and  pressed strongly that, looking ahead and ii. PRINCIPLES.[6986]B
  taking into/accpunt probable  future developments, the&apos;,time is hot far  distant  when attacks on  defended ports will be delivered!:mainly&apos; by aircraft, without  ships being brought within the range of any fixed defences on shore.  This is a  matter which we.shall examine in greater detail later,in.this Report..            III. THE PRESENT  POSITION OF  OUR. COAST DEFENCES.      6.   The present position is that plans based on the  assumption that the gun  is the principal coast defence weapon have been prepared for the re-armament of^ the coa.st defences of the Empire at all the home defended ports and most of the  Colonial ports, as well as for Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.   These  plans, although apjDroved at the time by the Committee of Imperial Defence, have  not yet been  implemented to any appreciable extent, for a number of reasons,  the more important of which are (1) economy; (2) the assumption  governing the  Estimates of the Defence Services that there will  be no major war  for ten years;  and last, but not least, (3)  a  technical controversy as to whether guns or aircraft  are the best and most economical weapon of defence against attack from the sea.  At the present time, therefore, the whole of  the coast defences of the Empire at  home and abroad  are obsolete  and out-ranged by the guns  of  a modern Cruiser  armed  with  6-inch ordnance.   Moreover, owing to the technical  controversy  aforesaid, there is a deadlock as to the type of  defence to be provided at many of  our ports as a deterrent to the heavier forms of attack to  which they have hitherto  been deemed  to be exposed.      7.  The seriousness of this situation has recently been brought home to the  Committee of Imperial Defence during the international crisis in China, when it  was realised  that the ports on which the fleet would depend for its  stocks  of fuel  on  a  voyage  to the Ear East, and for facilities for its maintenance there after  arrival, were insufficiently defended.  In this connection it has to be borne in  mind that coast defences, on  whatever system they are based,  must,  in  the  aggregate, involve a considerable expenditure which will have  to be spread over  a number of years.     8.  In order that a start may be made with the work, we think it important  that there should be no further delay in taking  a decision  as to the type of  defence-to be provided.                  IV. OUTLINE  OF THE AIR STAFF&apos;s CLAIM.     9.  There is, we find, complete agreement between the three Defence Services  that Air Forces, when they can  be made available for Coast Defence, are of great  value.  Beyond that point,  however, there is a great divergence of opinion.  The  Air Staff hold that aircraft ought to replace guns as the basic weapon of coast  defence. The older Services regard this proposal as unsound and unsafe, although  they  are  anxious  to have  the  co-operation of the Royal Air Force  wherever  possible.     10.  The claim to substitute aeroplanes for guns was first made in a concrete  form  in 1925, when  the Chief of the Air Staff (Lord Trenchard) dissented from  a proposal to include 15-inch  guns in the defence of  the new Naval Base at  Singapore, and  recommended that torpedo-bombing aircraft should be  provided  instead. It is, perhaps, worth mentioning that, among the many reasons adduced  in support of his proposal, Lord Trenchard pointed out that, as war with Japan  was unlikely for at least ten years, the opportunity was a favourable one  for  ascertaining  whether the gradual development of aircraft would prove effective  as a means of defence.     11.  Since 1925 the views  of the Air Staff have developed, and at the time  bur Enquiry began they claimed that aircraft could undertake the tasks, not only  of heavy guns (12-inch and above), but also of medium (9-2-inch) gups and even,  in  a  few cases of light  (6-inch)  guns  at certain ports  at which the Naval and  Military Staffs had recommended the provision of new guns or the  re-equipment  of  existing guns of these calibres with  high-angle mountings in order to  deal  with  the long-range weapons with which modern men-of-war are armed.
    12.  The main heads of the case for the substitution of Air Forces for gunsas the  basic,- weapon, ,of coast  defence   are. conveniently summarised  in aMemorandum presented to us by the  Chief of the Air Staff&quot;in the&apos; following terms            ,&apos;                    .     .  .     ,&apos;,               .&apos;? ,&apos;i     T    (a) The first proposition is that Air forces  are now  required to: meet,the          already existing and rapidly growing menace of air attack, ship-borne          and land-based, against our ports and  coasts.    (b) The second proposition is that these Air  forces, together with light gun          defences and local Naval defences, can be used with effect against all          other forms of attack, including  bombardment, invasion and raids.    (c)  Thirdly, and this alone  is the essence of  the so-called &quot; Air v. Gun          controversy,&quot; that where the Air forces  supplied for Air defence  are          insufficient to meet also the present scale of ship bombardment, then          the provision of additional striking aircraft would be a better form of          insurance than expenditure upon increasing and bringing up to date          the main artillery defences, which would themselves require consider-          able Air Forces for ancillary duties in  any case.                     V. THE  MENACE OF  AIR  ATTACK.     13.  The suggestion in proposition (a) that our ports are exposed to the riskof ship-borne and land-based air attack and that this may in time become the mostserious risk is not a new one, for as long ago as November, 1919, in a Memorandum(C.B. 0911) on &quot; Forms of Attack from the Sea  to which Ports at Home and overseas may be subjected,&quot; the Admiralty suggested that          &quot; The development of  aircraft may be carried so far that the menace     from the air will become greater than that from the sea, and bombardment     from the  air entirely supersede that from the  sea.   Bombs  of 1,800 lbs. have     been  carried  by aeroplanes during the War.   The  loss  of one or more     aeroplanes is  insignificant in comparison with the  loss of  a capital ship, or     even  a monitor, yet  a  well-directed bomb  from a single  aeroplane might     achieve what hundreds of rounds fired from a  ship may fail to achieve.&quot;One of the issues, therefore, to which we have had to direct our attention is as towhether air attack  has already superseded, or is likely in the near future tosupersede,  naval attack as the principal menace to our ports.     14.  So far as seaborne  air  attack is concerned,  the suggestion  that thisparticular  menace is &quot; already  existing and rapidly growing &quot; is supported bythe following figures for the first-line strength  of  shipborne aircraft  of  theprincipal Naval Powers to-day and as projected by 1937 :                                                  1931.       1937.             The  United Kingdom         ...     153         219             United States  of America     ...     314         762             Japan      ...      ...       ...     107         329    15.  Nevertheless, the evidence laid before  us shows that there are certainlimitations on the extent of this menace.  We do  not think it  necessary to dealwith the evidence  on this point  in detail in our Eeport, for the reason that  themain heads of the subject are conveniently set out in the following statement ofthe position, contained in the  current edition of Forms  of  Attack and Forms ofDefence (C.I.D. Paper No. 308-C, paragraphs 44 and 45) as follows :                                          -    &quot; (a) Attack by Carrier-borne Aircraft.        44.  The  Washington Treaty limits the  total tonnage of aircraft carriers    of over  10,000 tons  which any signatory may  possess.  Owing  to this    restriction, to their extreme vulnerability to  all forms of sea-borne  attack    and to their great value in Fleet operations, attacks on ports by carrier air-    craft are likely to be delivered only in the most favourable circumstances and    when the object of attack  is of vital importance to the  defenders/      T69861                                                      B2
   , ,    Aircraft operating,from carriers are,,moreover, subject.to;certain limi4i    taiions, chiefly.as regards the time taken in flying.them on to carriers; they   I are ^Iso restricted in respect.of dimensions, which are limited by.the size of    lifts and hangars.   . ,  &apos; , Attacks from carriers may take the form of bombing; torpedo, or fighter    attack, or air spotting in conjunction with naval bombardment.   .        Should future building programmes include the construction of large   ; numbers of carriers of  under 10,000 tons-a size which is not restricted in    numbers by.the terms of the Washington Treaty ports would offer favour-    able objectives for air attacks from these ships.   Considerable damage could    be inflicted on  objects of strategical importance such as dockyards, convoy    assemblies and  oil-fuel reserves.   si    Interference to which carriers are liable, from enemy surface vessels and    aircraft, owing to the delaying operation of flying on or hoisting in aircraft,    may be considerably reduced where the target is within flying range of an air    base, since aircraft can return there after attack, instead of to their parent    ship.    (b)  A attack by aircraft  carried in other fighting ships or armed merchant               vessels  .        45.   The limits of space in  these vessels  prevent the delivering  of    torpedo or bombing attacks of a serious nature.    The chief role of aircraft    carried by them will be reconnaissance and spotting for bombarding vessels,    although where the type of catapult admits, torpedo-bombing aircraft may be    employed as an alternative.   Where the defences of a port are  known to be    weak,  seaplanes  carried in  merchant vessels may  be  employed to  deliver    bombing attacks.&quot;    16.   There have, of course, been technical developments since 1927,  when theMemorandum from  which  the above  extract  is  quoted was  approved  by theCommittee of Imperial Defence.   On the one hand, there have been improvements in the design of aircraft-carriers and  in the facilities  for aircraft carried  onboard other vessels.  Larger numbers of aircraft can be carried;  the arrangementsfor flying the aircraft off and on have made an advance;  and the aircraft them-selves have improved.  On the other hand, there has  been a steady improvementin anti-aircraft fire.  On the whole, however, the above extract represents veryfairly the general impression we have derived from the evidence on the  extent ofthe menace to our ports from aircraft attack.    17.   Whether eventually attack by sea-borne  aircraft on ports may replacebombardment  by warships  we  cannot tell.   The evidence we have  received,however, does not support the view that it would be sound  to base our coast defence system on the assumption that this development is imminent.  If aircraft have improved since the War, the same is true of naval gunnery.  The volume of rapid and accurate fire within the capacity of a modern fleet, and the damage that could be inflicted in favourable conditions on a naval base or mercantile port, are so great that an enemy who found a  favourable opportunity  to  carry out abombardment  would certainly not hesitate to resort  to  it in the absence of  anadequate deterrent.  The fact that many foreign nations have recently rearmedtheir coast defences with heavy guns, and are continuing to do so, is an indication that they do not take the view that bombardment is about to be superseded by air attack.  Since it is foreign nations whose attack we have to apprehend,  we thinkthat for an indefinite time to come our  coast defence system  must provide againstship bombardment as well as attack by aircraft.                     VI. DEFENCE AGAINST AIR ATTACK.    18.  Before coming to the Chief of the Air Staffs second proposition, it isnecessary to consider how far it is true,  as assumed in the first proposition, thataircraft are required to meet aircraft attack on. our ports.  Here the  technicalevidence is in conflict.                       &apos;   -,       ;     1    \\    .19:  1 Against sea-borne aircraft attack it is clear that the ordinary counter-bombardment armament is useless, since the carriers or other vessels from which
 the&apos;aircraft-start would never come within range of the guns;&apos;and c6as&apos;t defpnce artillery&apos;cannot normally!be used&apos; for anti-aircraft work.  Consequently&apos;,&apos; tftere are two-possible means of defence, namely, (1) to attack the floating&apos;base,, Whether by torpedo-bombing aircraft,  or by submarines, or surface craft; arid (2) to oppose the attacking aircraft with anti-aircraft guns and fighter aeroplanes,  if available. The same principles hold good in the case of land-based aircraft.           &apos;lv     20.   Both these means of defence are subject to certain limitations, on which the evidence is conflicting.  Defending aircraft, for example, may fail,to locate the carriers at  all under unfavourable circumstances mist, cloud,  rain, snow, sudden changes of weather, the fall of night, and so forth or they may not find them until the aircraft have been launched and have delivered  their attack;  or, after finding the carriers, which would be screened by every known device against every form  of attack, they may fail to obtain hits,  and may even sustain heavy casualties themselves.  On the other hand, the anti-aircraft defences at the port may fail to hit  the attacking aircraft, or to prevent them, by breaking up their formation, from accomplishing their purpose.     21.  As we have already stated, and as we shall have to repeat, the evidence on all these points is very conflicting.  The  opinions formed by the  Naval Staff from experience with the Fleet Air Arm differ from those of the Air  Staff on  the reliability of aircraft in finding their  objective.  Also,  the value of anti-aircraft fire, whether in the defence of ships or ports, is rated very much higher in  the older Services than it is  in the Royal Air Force a matter to which we return in Section VII of this Report.     22.  In all the circumstances, we consider that, as an ideal,  both forms of defence  ought to  be provided.  Financial considerations  will render this  idealimpossible of attainment at most ports, and, as in the past, a measure of risk will have to be taken.   For  the defence of naval bases of the very  first importance,however, such as Singapore,  we think that both  torpedo-bombing aircraft and a powerful anti-aircraft defence should be made available.  We are glad to  learn that progress is being made in this direction.     23.  We have not examined  in detail the case of those ports liable to attack from land-based aerodromes, which is likely to be far  more formidable.  At all such ports a powerful  anti-aircraft  defence will be required.   At  home ports the arrangements  for counter-attack will, we understand, be an extension of  the general scheme of  air defence of the United Kingdom.  At the few ports abroad that are  liable to this form  of attack, each case must be considered on its merits.                   VII.-DEFENCE AGAINST  NAVAL  ATTACK.                          Technical Considerations.                    - -    24.  In paragraph 17 we stated our view that, for an indefinite time to come,our coast defence system must provide against ship bombardment as well as attack by aircraft.  This brings us to the Chief of the Air Staffs second proposition,that the  Air forces required against air attack, together with light gun defences and local Naval  defences, can be used with effect against all other forms of attack,including bombardment, invasion and raids.   With this may be considered  histhird proposition, that  where these  air  forces  are insufficient  to  meet  shipbombardment  the provision of  additional air  forces  would be  preferable  to bringing up to  date and  increasing  the gun defences, which, in his  opinion,themselves require considerable air forces for ancillary duties in any case.  Wedo not think there is much  difference of opinion anywhere that Air forces, whenavailable, can &quot;be used with effect &quot;  for the above purposes, but  the suggestionthat they are so effective and reliable as to justify the supersession of the gun isa more controversial proposition.    25.  One of the advantages  claimed  for  the Air  Staffs plan  is that theaircraft  allotted to the defence of a port need not constantly be anchored there; asin the case of  fixed defences.   They can be moved elsewhere to meet  a changingsituation; but the  Chief  of the Air Staff has assured.us more than once that his proposals would not entail denuding the defences of any port;which  is liable toattack.
    26.  We  would note,  in passing, that this advantage  is one  that is not peculiar to the Royal Air Force.  Coast defence guns on fixed mountings, it istrue, are not easily moved elsewhere,, although even this is not unknown.  but during the Great War the personnel of the Royal Garrison Artillery was replacedin the coast defences and used to man heavy and medium  mobile batteries, andthe regular  Infantry stationed at defended ports were replaced by Territorialbattalions and used for the formation of new Infantry Divisions.  The movableartillery of a coast fortress is also, of course, mobile.    27.  In spite  of the Chief of the Air Staffs assurances, we  feel that  thereis force  in the objection that, at the critical moment, air  forces  allotted to thedefence  of  a  port may not  be  on the  spot.  Suppose,  for example, that  acomparatively sudden outbreak of war in the  Far East was to be preceded bywidespread  disturbance throughout India and  the East, in the course of which our Air forces in those regions  were exposed to prolonged strain; in  such circumstances  it seems not unlikely that the  Government of the day might thinkit worth while to run what might at first appear to be the lesser risk  of drainingaway  the air  defenders of  ports throughout  the East, in order  to  meet  anemergency more immediate, if not ultimately so serious.   In the event of a major war, when the demand for air forces for all purposes might  become overwhelmingand might  be supported by a  strong public  opinion,  it seems by no meansimprobable that the air forces allotted to coast  defence might be taken away forsome other purpose, whether  the situation really justified it or not-.  During theGreat War, we are  informed, fighter  squadrons were withdrawn from Franceowing to popular clamour over the air raids on London.    28.  We  think that there is a good deal to be said for Admiral Mahan&apos;sstatement, that &quot; Permanent works, established  in  quiet moments on soundprinciples, have the advantage that they cannot be shifted under the  influence ofpanic.&quot;    29.  Assuming,  for purposes of inquiry, that the presence of  aircraft at our ports could  be relied on, the next point that arises is as to  their efficiency andreliability in comparison with guns. As an illustration of our doubts, the Chief ofthe Air  Staff has informed us that if the strategical centre of gravity shifted fromthe Far  East to Europe, he would, under his proposals, reduce the Royal Air Force squadrons at Singapore to 2f- Squadrons, compared with a  total strength of 8 to Squadrons required for a  war in the Far East. It is possible to imagine a situation in  which the former provision might prove inadequate in the event of a sudden change in the situation.  The answer depends upon the determination ofa number of technical issues.   Although the naval and military Staffs are agreed in principle and in  detail  on every point, there is hardly any common groundbetween them and the Air Staff on any of the questions involved.    30.  For  example,  the Chief  of  the Air  Staff  seeks to show not  veryconvincingly, in our view that the deterrent effect of coast defence  guns in theGreat War has been over-rated, and that the big gun has had its day.  He claims that under  modern  conditions  guns provide  a  less  effective and  economicaldeterrent than aircraft, not only for our ports, but for our coasts as well- Onthe other  hand,  the  old  Services  draw  from war  experience  conclusionsdiametrically opposed to those of the Chief  of  the Air Staff.  They speak  withconviction of the gun, in conjunction with the other forms of coast defence, as aknown,  proved and reliable deterrent to the  more vital forms of attack, whereasaircraft, they  point  out, have not been  tested in war for coast defence.   Onbehalf of the  gun  it is claimed that it can  be  tested  in  peace under conditionsapproximating with those  of war, which is not the  case with aircraft.   It is claimed  also that  the gun  is the superior weapon for dealing with a  surpriseattack, since it can come into action almost at a moment&apos;s notice, and that aircraft are-of less value for meeting an attack of the &quot;tip-and-run &quot;  variety, owingto the time required to come into action.  The Air Force  reply is that with  goodorganisation a fully-armed squadron can leave the ground within,  2-J- minutes ofthe alai-m.   They point out, also, that on many occasions aircraft will find and attack a ship,  at a distance from the port, before a bombardment  can be carriedout, and they  claim  that the aeroplane cannot fail to find the ship  if  it comes within bombarding range of the port.
   ,., 31 v&apos; Neither of the older Services has any confidence in the aeroplane at night.   The Air  Staff claim that at night the advantage  rests definitely  with aircraft, which can carry&apos;powerful flares, that would illuminate a; ship far outside the range of any searchlight from the shore.  Experience with the Fleet Air Arm, however, is said to show that the value of flares has been over-estimated.  The Naval and General Staffs  consider that aircraft are handicapped, not only in conditions of low visibility, but sometimes even in clear weather, by the state, of the atmosphere.  The Air  Staff reply that, aircraft can operate in any  visibility in which  guns can come into action, that tactical surprise by the defending aircraft is facilitated by  low visibility,  and  that it is  certain that  any ship attempting to take advantage of mist or  darkness to bombard any of our bases would incur a more serious risk from aircraft than from fixed artillery.     32.   The  Air Staff make a good deal  of the fact that bombarding ships may use smoke  screens, which,  they maintain, will prevent guns from  being  used effectively until spotting aircraft are in  position.   The reply to this  was that smoke screens can only be used comparatively rarely, when the wind is favourable; that they entail elaborate preparations and cannot be used without aerial observa- tion; that they are uncertain in their effects and are apt to hamper and react on the user; and that the occasions when guns will be blinded by smoke will be rare, especially when two observation posts are available.   On  these rare  occasions resort will be made to aircraft observation, when available.     33.   The  Chief of the  Air Staff, in estimating the ancillary requirements in aircraft for coast  defence batteries, allows  for considerable numbers of &quot;spotter &quot; aeroplanes, with fighters to protect them.  The General Staff, for some years after the War,  attached a good deal  more importance  than they do to-day  to the co-operation of spotter aircraft.  They state that, as the result of trials,  the value of air observation in coast defence has proved less than was anticipated, and that the direction of fire by  methods of observation other than air have been greatly improved.  At the same time, at  a port of first-class importance like Singapore, where it is desired to instal 15-inch guns, they consider that air observation would be an advantage and might at times be essential in order to  obtain the maximum effect.  The General Staff,  basing themselves partly on experience gained in the Great War, consider that the Air Staff over-stress the necessity  for  fighter machines to protect the spotters.     34.   On no point is there a greater divergence of opinion than as to the value of anti-aircraft fire, whether for the defence of ships or ports.  All are  agreed that anti-aircraft fire has improved rapidly in recent years; but the older Services have a confidence in its efficacy which is not in the least shared by the Air Staff. Each side supports its  belief with strong arguments and statistics of a highly&quot;technical character, into which we do not propose to enter in this Report.   This is a point of great importance, for, if the Naval view is correct, aircraft would possess  only very slight value as a substitute for guns,  and the whole  of the Air Staff case turns on their being able to hit their objective.  Unfortunately, it is one of the questions which cannot be decided either by argument or experiment, since it turns to some extent on how far it will be found possible to reproduce the accuracy of peace practices  (which  always have a  large element of unreality) under war conditions.  Among many  elements of doubt in our problem  this is perhaps the most  uncertain.     35.   So far as striking power is concerned we are satisfied that either shells &apos; (provided the calibre of the gun is sufficient for the scale of attack) or air bombs and torpedoes  would act as a sufficient  deterrent,  provided that an  adequate volume of fire can be  brought to  bear on the ship or ships.     36.   We would mention one more criticism directed against aircraft, namely, that  they are more liable than guns to be neutralised by superior force and worn down by a  process of.  attrition.   The  reply to this is that experience  in the Great War showed that greatly  superior numbers  were necessary in  order to neutralise a force of aircraft, and that the defending aircraft, being shore-based, would be more effective  than those borne in carriers, which are subject to certain disadvantages. Attrition  in the Air Staffs opinion is only to be  feared where an enemy can maintain a heavy scale of shore-based attack,  as at Malta or Hong Kong.
     37.   The above is merely a bare summary of the heads of the argumentsand counter-arguments used on the main technical points of our. Inquiry.  nearly every point could, in fact, be divided into sub-heads, under each of which therewould be  a  further  series of nicely-balanced  criticisms  and  replies.   This isparticularly  true in respect of the value of anti-aircraft fire.  We do not think,however,  that the Committee of  Imperial  Defence would wish to be burdenedwith further technical details. -  &apos;  38.   On some of these problems further  light may be shed  by carefullyco-ordinated experiments, but there are limitations to the progress in knowledge that can be made by this means, owing to the fact that risks can be run in war that are not  justifiable in peace, and to the impossibility in peace of reproducingwar conditions.   In the all-important matter of  anti-aircraft  fire  this latterconsideration has especial weight.  We do not believe that  this question can besettled, except by the test of actual war, and  even in war  allowance has  to bemade for  unexpected conditions, the human element and luck.     39.   We are not unmindful of the success which  has been achieved by theAjr Force in assuming responsibility in other directions,  particularly in  theNear and Middle East.  With so many elements of uncertainty  in the case,however, we could not take the responsibility on any technical grounds that havebeen  presented to us, for recommending a complete  change  of system in  theimportant sphere of coast  defence against the considered opinion, held  withconviction and ably presented to us by  the Chief of the Naval Staff and  theChief of the Imperial General Staff.  We consider that,  if a change should becomedesirable  on  technical grounds, it is far  more likely to be brought  about as theresult of  mutual co-operation than  by controversial methods.  Before  leaving the subject of defence against Naval attack, we feel we should  mention-that theChief of  the Air Staff  submitted to us  definite proposals for the defence by aircraft of eight Colonial ports,  including  Singapore.    For the  reasons given above we are unable to  recommend adoption of  theseproposals,  and in  the circumstances we do  not  consider it necessary to describethem in detail.                  VIII. SOME  GENERAL  CONSIDERATIONS.    40.  Before we sum up  our  conclusions on the whole question there  arecertain points of a more  general character to which we  desire to invite attention.    41.  A consideration which, we think, cannot be ignored,  and  to which wehave already made passing  reference, is the practice of foreign nations in  coast defence.   France,  the  United States of America, Italy and Japan, in spite ofthe possession of large air  forces, some of which  are  allotted  to coast defence,still rely on the gun as  the primary weapon in coast defences.  Since the  Warthey have spent, or are  spending, large sums on coast defence artillery, as  arecertain other nations.  The  Secretary for  War of the United States of America,in his Report  for 1930, arrived  at  the following conclusion after  thorough examination  and exhaustive trials :         &quot; Like other arms, the value of  the coast  artillery has been  increased    by the development of  aviation.  Bombardment aviation supplements  coast    artillery by attacking naval vessels beyond artillery range.....At ranges    within the power of coast artillery,  however,  the  amount of metal which    aviation can deliver is relatively insignificant compared to  that available    to the gun defence.  The advent of aviation has not,  therefore, affected  the    necessity for  maintaining fortifications for the defence of our important    harbours against naval attack.&quot;    43.  We recognise the great efficiency of the Royal Air Force, and the abilitywith which their case has been presented is the measure of the zeal and ability of the Air Staff.  But when we find the views of our experienced Admiralty and war Office General Staffs on these highly controversial questions coincide  withuniversal  foreign practice, we are bound to give them special weight.  If our ports lack the form  of defence  on which  our potential  enemies rely for  thesecurity of their own bases,  it may be supposed  that the deterrent to attack willbe less.
 &quot;&quot;;!43.u; We are also impressed:by the argument that&apos; the Navy are entitled torather a^ large&apos; say in the type&quot; of defence to be provided at: du^r-pdrts&apos;.&apos;;&apos; They areconcerned,  more than&apos;&apos;any other&apos; Service,,&apos;    the security&apos; of,&apos;our ports. 1 ( Navalbases1 and&quot;&quot;fcditimemM^pbrts:form&apos;&apos;tin&apos; essential ingredient of:&apos;sea-pdwer, for&apos;theexercise&apos; of&apos; which the. Admiralty has the&apos; main responsibility.&apos;;&apos;1 It is&apos; important that&apos;&quot;neither the&apos; Admiralty nor its  Commanders-in-Chief &quot;shbulb! be-hamperM&apos; intheir strategy by doubts as to the  security of these ports;  They are in&apos; a better position than, anyone else to judge -the probabilities of naval attack.:.; In-the useof Air Forces over the sea they have great experience.  The  Admiralty, spend 3.000,000 a year on the Fleet Air Arm, 70 per cent, of the pilots  and 100 percent, of the observers of which are Naval  Officers.   Combined with their war experience, when they claim to have controlled about 3,000 machines  in the royal naval Air Service, their ten years&apos; post-War experience with the Fleet Air  Armentitles their views on this question to rather especial respect.     .-.    44.  Disarmament  is another  of the general questions which have a bearing on the issue before us.  The tendency of the present  day is towards a reductionof what are sometimes termed  &quot;offensive armaments.&quot;  We are aware  of theobjections and difficulties raised by the Air  Staff to the abolition of  bombers and bombing.  We have made a separate report on this subject, but we have.no ideahow that particular controversy will develop at Geneva.  Nevertheless, we feelthat the substitution of aircraft for fixed defences would lay us open to tbe charge that it was a  camouflage  to enable us to  increase  our  striking force,  andthe suspicion would not be altogether groundless.   The Chief of the Air  Staffsuggests that if we are allowed parity in the air  with France we shall  have sufficient aircraft to undertake responsibility for coast defence, and he explainsthat we intend to insist on such parity at the Disarmament Conference.  We donot know  whether France will agree to accept  parity, whether metropolitan oruniversal,  with  ourselves, but even if she does there would  appear to be an element of unreality in the term if a large proportion of our  air force is to belocked up  in coast defence.    45.  Another general consideration is the proposal of the Chief of the AirStaff-        &apos;&apos; That authority  should  be given for the  three Services to carry out    progressive training and graduated practical trials in coast defence  for the    purpose, among others, of furnishing a basis upon which some comparison    between the aeroplane and the gun in the particular  function of counter-    bombardment under modern  conditions could be  drawn.&quot;    46.  We think that combined exercises, with a view to ascertaining how theRoyal  Air Force can best co-operate with the other Services in Coast Defence,would be most valuable.  The Navy has its Fleet Air Arm, which enables theprinciples of co-operation to  be worked out between  the different elements ofthe Navy on, underneath, and above the surface of  the sea.  The Army  has itsco-operation squadrons. Whatever be the decision on the main issues dealt with inthis Report, we should like to see carried out a series of carefully  co-ordinatedand progressive exercises in the many uses of the air arm for coast  defence.    We suggest that the three Service Departments  should consider the  settingup  of a Board to devise and supervise these exercises.  It might report to theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    47.  We have not attempted  to enter  in detail  into the highly complicated and controversial financial aspects of  the  Chief of the Air  Staffs proposals.We should  perhaps  mention,  however,  that the claim of the  Chief of the AirStaff that defence by aircraft is cheaper than  defence by guns is  contested bythe other  Service departments.  If we had any serious doubts  as  to what our policy ought to be from the point of view of efficiency, we might have been obligedto investigate further the complexity of financial cost, upkeep and  replacement.But, as the  next Section of our Report will reveal, we have no such doubts.                  IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.    48.  Broadly the choice lies  between  substittttion of aircraft  for, medium and heavy guns, as the main basis of our coast defence system, and - co-operationbetween the three Services  in a  scheme  of  coast  defence based  on existingprinciples.  &apos; We are unanimous in recommending co-operation.       [6986]                                 &apos;                      c
     49.   At the present time we cannot, recommend the adoption,of the principleurged by the Chief of the Air Staff with so much ability and confidence, owingto the many uncertain factors in the problem.   But in coming to this conclusionwe do not overlook the present and future value of the Air Arm.  We will not attempt to forecast whether in course of time it may be desirable to adopt airforces instead  of  guns as the basis of our coast defences,, and much less when that time will come.  We fully agree,  however, with the Chief of the Naval staff and the Chief of.the Imperial  General Staff  that aircraft, when available, area valuable addition to  existing means of coast defence.   Indeed, we  registerour belief that at  the more important ports aircraft are essential in addition toguns, not only for reconnaissance and  spotting, but also for anti-aircraft defence(fighters) and for  attacking  aircraft carriers, capital  ships  and other vessels,more especially beyond the range of the guns.  At Singapore,  for example, weare satisfied that  the co-operation of aircraft of all kinds, including bombingaircraft,  is  a matter of considerable importance.   The extent to which  such operations are likely to  succeed in the  face  of anti-aircraft gunfire from theships is an uncertain factor on which  we cannot pronounce  judgment, but webelieve that the addition of aircraft to the defence of a port must add materiallyto the deterrent.     50.   For the  above reasons  we are convinced that  the use of aircraft forcoast defence ought to be continuously studied and that appropriate experimentsshould be made.     51.   The question of the 15-inch gun is one of the most difficult problems in our investigation.  Logically, if the gun is to remain the  basis of our coast defence these weapons ought to be provided at ports liable to attack by modernoapital ships, since  the  9-2-inch  gun  will not  pierce  their armour.  At thepresent time the only port satisfying this condition is Singapore, though it ispossible that Malta* may come into this category if and when the French andItalian navies  are provided with modern  capital ships.  We are unwilling totake&apos; avoidable risks  at  Singapore,  and we  think   that,  as recommendedunanimously by the Chiefs of  Staff  Sub-Committee  and  approved  by  theCommittee of Imperial  Defence in March 1928, the first stage of the plan ofdefence for Singapore, modified, of course, in the light of the latest developments in  coast  artillery and including provision for three 15-inch  gtms, should  be proceeded with.t   We understand  that the  intention  is to proceed first, withthe installation of 9-2-inch guns.   We consider that the commencement of thesecond stage of the scheme for the defence of Singapore should not be undertakenUntil after a further recommendation by the Committee of  Imperial Defence.For the reasons already  stated we attach great importance to  the inclusion of aircraft in the  defences  at Singapore, even if the  complete scheme for 15-inch guns is carried  out.     52.   We are  aware  that there are  many points of detail in this  Report,especially on the technical side,  on  which a good deal more could be said.   we found it impossible, without inexcusable prolixity, to follow up each detail tothe last point.  While there may be points of detail which can be criticised byone or other of the Defence Departments, we have confidence in the  soundnessof  our general  conclusions, and think  it important  that the general question should not be reopened prematurely, as this would not promote that co-operationbetween the Defence Services to which we attach supreme importance.     53.   Co-operation between  the  three Services should be the keynote of ourcoast defence system.  Some years before the War there were wide  differences ofopinion  between the Admiralty  and War Office on various questions, includingcoast defence.  By constant contact, and with  the assistance of various inquiriespromoted by the Committee of Imperial Defence, these differences were graduallysurmounted, and  we have been  impressed by the close understanding between these Departments.  We look forward  to the establishment of  an equally closeunderstanding between  the Air Ministry  and the older Departments on coast defence questions, and we believe that the right solution, whatever it may prove tobe  in the long run, is  far more likely to be found  by co-operation than  by    * We are informed that 13-5-in. guns have been proposed for Malta in the eventuality referred to.    t  Appendix I gives the details of the first stage of the military  plan of defence.   Appendix it contains an approximate estimate, prepared in the War Office, of the cost of completing- this stage.
controversy.  We conclude, therefore, with the strongest possible appeal  to altconcerned  to carry  out  our recommendations  in a  spirit  of  constructive-co-operation.    54.  Our recommendations may be summed up as follows:            ...    (a) Coast defences should be organised on a basis of co-operation between           the three Defence Services, the gun retaining its place  as the main           deterrent against Naval attack.    (b) At the same time, aircraft are a most important factor to be reckoned           with in considering both forms of attack and forms of defence.  Their           co-operation will  always increase the security of the fortress and add           to the deterrent effect of the fixed defences.   In the case of the more           important naval bases their co-operation is essential.    (c) We consider that the first stage of the plan of defence for the naval base           at Singapore, modified in the light of the latest developments in coast           artillery, should be proceeded  with,  including the provision of three           15-inch guns.  The second stage should await a further recommenda-           tion by the Committee of Imperial Defence.    (d) In accordance with (b), the royal Air Force should continue to co-operate           in the defence  of Singapore with such forces as may,  from time to           time, be  deemed  desirable.  Such co-operation should extend  to all           branches of the defence, including anti-aircraft defence (fighters), and           offensive operations against aircraft carriers, capital  ships, and all           other forms of attack by sea, land or air.    (e) The  War Office should be authorised to proceed, as financial  conditions           permit,  with the schemes that have been worked out for  re-arming           coast defences  at other ports  up to and including 9-2-inch guns, in           such order  of  priority as may be approved from time to time by the           Committee  of Imperial Defence on the recommendation of the Chiefs        t  of Staff Sub-Committee.    (/) Arrangements should be concerted between the three defence Services for           progressive training and  graduated practical trials, with a view to           establishing the -principles and practice of co-operation by the Royal           Air  Force  in  all branches of coast  defence.   The three  Defence           Services  should consider the setting up of  a Board to arrange andl           supervise the practical trials and to report periodically to the Chiefs           of Staff  Sub-Committee.    (g) The general questions dealt with in this Report should not be reopened           prematurely, and the three Defence Services should co-operate with           the   utmost  cordiality  and&apos;   frankness  in  giving  effect  to  our           recommendations, for by co-operation rather than by controversy the           ultimate solution of these problems is to be found.(Signed)STANLEY BALDWIN (Chairman).P.

APPENDIX I.            &quot; First Stage &quot; of. the Military Defences for Singapore.    THE &quot; First Stage &quot; of defences for Singapore, which was approved bythe Cabinet in 1928  (vide Minute 14 at the 235th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence), is detailed in paragraph 12 (/) of C.I.D. Paper No. 315-Cand consisted of the following :     (i)  Coast Defence Guns           2-6-inch 15G at Changi Hill.          2 9-2-inch (conversion to 350) at Blakang Mati.          2-9-2-inch 35Q at Pulau Tekong (Besar).          1 15-inch at Bee Hoe.          1 15-inch at Blakang Mati.          1 15-inch  at Wing Loong.          2-6-inch 75Q (now 450)  at Pulau Tekong (Besar).    (ii) Anti-Aircraft Guns           4 per annum, up  to a total of 24.    (iii) Lights           To be  installed  at the discretion of the War Office, when the results               of  the  experiments  then  being carried out were available.                                   NOTES.    1.  The 2 6-inch guns at Changi Hilll have already been emplaced.    2.  As a result of lessons learnt from practices since 1928 it is proposedthat the 9-2-inch, 2-gun batteries shown above should be 3-gun batteries.    3.  The siting of the 15-inch guns would also require modification to conform with the need for 3-gun batteries.    4.  Eight of the 24 Anti-Aircraft  guns are already available at Singapore.    5.  Of the material required, the following are available  from stock :            15-inch guns :  3 -15-inch ordnance  and one 15-inch  mounting.*           9-2-inch guns :  1 9-2-inch ordnance.           6-inch guns :  2-6-inch ordnance.           3-inch A.A. guns : 16 guns and mountings without instruments.           6-inch ammunition :  As required.   * It is understood that further 15-inch guns are being- held by the Admiralty at the disposal of theWar Office.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  June 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.   24COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from- the Minutes of the &quot;25Qth Meeting, held on June 9, 1932.                         (1.)-COAST  DEFENCE.                        (C.I.D. Paper No. 370-C.*)     (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 254th Meeting, Minute 4.)     THE  COMMITTEE had under  consideration a Report (C.I.D.  Paper&apos;No.  370-C) by a Sub-Committee under  the Chairmanship of the Lord Presidentof the Council which had been set up in accordance with the following conclusion.reached at the 254th Meeting on the 7th December, 1931 :            To examine the whole Coast  Defence situation; in particular develop-     ments resulting from the introduction of Air Forces with a view to making     recommendations  for  improving  the  security  of  the  defended ports     throughout the Empire.&quot;     THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that the Report was a most important one,  and that all concerned in its  production were  to be congratulated.  Therecommendations were summarised  in paragraph 54 on page 11, and could, hesuggested,  be dealt with under the three headings  of principle, practice andexperiment.     The first two recommendations, (a) and (b), dealt with the question ofprinciple, and stated that          &quot; (a)  Coast  defence should be organised on  a basis of  co-operation     between the three Defence Services, the gun retaining its place as the main     deterrent against naval attack.         (b) At  the  same time, aircraft  are  a most  important  factor to  be     reckoned with in considering both forms  of  attack and forms of  defence.     Their co-operation will always increase the security of the fortress and add     to  the deterrent  effect  of  the  fixed defences.   In the case  of the more     important naval bases, their co-operation is essential.&quot;     He suggested that the Committee should first deal with these two opinions-and  then proceed to (c), (d) and (e),  dealing with practical measures.    LORD LONDONDERRY, referring to (b), suggested that if the Committeeof Imperial Defence adopted it, they should invite the Air Ministry to submit their proposals  for  development,  including  the  provision of  the  necessaryaerodromes and landing grounds at  the more important fortresses  such  asSingapore, Trincomali and Hong Kong,  in order to enable the necessary air co-operation -operation to be provided.    LORD HAILSHAM remarked  that the proposals of the War Office and theAdmiralty in regard to these  ports would, of course, have  to be  submittedsimultaneously.     THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that machinery existed already inthe Joint Oversea and Home Defence  Committee for considering  the  detailed proposals for the defence of ports,  and that this Sub-Committee would submit their reports for approval by the Committee of  Imperial Defence.  He suggested* Also C.I.D. Paper No. 186-A.
that if conclusions (a) and (b) were approved, the detailed plans should, therefore,be left for co-Ordination and submission by the Joint Oversea and Home DefenceCommittee.     Turning to recommendation (c), in which it was suggested that the first stage of the plan of defence for Singapore, including  the provision of three 15-inch guns, should be proceeded with, he  pointed out that this would involve  the alteration of a decision taken at the Imperial Conference  of 1930.  He  asked mr.  Baldwin, as Chairman of the Coast Defence  Sub-Committee, if he had anyexplanation to make on this point.     MR. BALDWIN said he would like to take the opportunity of thanking thethree Chiefs of Staff for all the help  they had given during the enquiry, whichmust have taken up a  lot of their time in preparing documents and  givingevidence.     As regards Singapore, owing to general conditions in the Far East and therecent crisis which had arisen over Shanghai,  it was obvious  that if the Japaneseever &apos;&apos; ran amok &apos;&apos; we would, in  present circumstances, be helpless,  and theywould be in a position to capture Hong Kong and Singapore without  difficulty.He suggested that trouble in the Far  East might easily occur  again, and unlessSingapore was strengthened, the nearest defended  base of importance on the route to the Far East would be Malta.  The Coast Defence  Sub-Committee had,therefore, made this recommendation for completing the first stage of the defence plans of Singapore, subject, of course, to financial considerations, and they fely strongly on  the point.  He emphasised that the whole security of the Empire inthe Far East might well depend on the  safety of Singapore.   He -also pointedout that the decision reached at the Imperial Conference in 1930 to postpone workon Singapore until 1935, was based mainly  on the existence of  the assumptionthat there would be no major war for ten years.  He considered now that a newdecision was necessary.     SIR   BOLTON   EYRES-MONSELL   wholeheartedly  agreed   withMr.  Baldwin, and mentioned that he had invited the attention of the Cabinetto the dangerous situation at Singapore when the trouble at Shanghai was at itsheight.  He sincerely hoped that  this critical situation would not now be forgottenand that a decision on Singapore would be taken.  A great deal of money, ourown as well as that of other people, had  been spent on Singapore, but  what hadalready been done was, by itself,  not only useless it invited attack.     LORD  HAILSHAM supported the  view that the position disclosed duringthe recent trouble between Japan and  China was not one which could be acceptedwith equanimity.   In  recommending  that  Singapore should be adequatelydefended we had no offensive designs, but it should not be forgotten that we had certain responsibilities for the defence of the eastern part of the Empire.     LORD  LONDONDERRY said that the Coast Defence Sub-Committee had come to conclusions with which, naturally, the Air Ministry did not agree, andhe was sorry that the  policy of substituting  aircraft for guns had not beenaccepted.   He  feared that  the decision  reached would mean  considerableadditional cost.     SIR FREDERICK FIELD said  he had nothing to say except that whilst hewas fully alive to the present financial stringency,  he felt it really necessary, fromthe  defence point of view,  that the  defence of Singapore  and the other portsconcerned should be put on a sound basis during  the next few years, and that ifwork could  be started, say, next year, it  would improve matters.     SIR GEORGE MILNE and SIR JOHN SALMOND concurred.     MR. LATHAM said that  he would be very glad, speaking on  behalf ofAustralia, to see the proposal to proceed with the defences of Singapore accepted.It was hardly necessary  for him to  say how  important Singapore was  to thesecurity of the Dominions in the Pacific. One thing he would like  to know was whether it was proposed to proceed immediately and forthwith, or whether sucha question as, for example, the installation of 15-inch guns at Singapore,  wouldbe considered in relation to the Disarmament Conference which might affect suchmateriel.  He presumed, however, that some  time would inevitably elapse  beforeanything overt appeared at Singapore.
     THE PRIME  MINISTER pointed out that nothing  was shown  in the Estimates for the current year  for  Singapore and he  invited attention  to paragraph 51 of the Report in which it was indicated that the installation of the 9-2-inch guns would be undertaken before the 15-inch guns were installed.     MR.  LATHAM agreed that this was stated, but he  pointed  out there was a question of principle whether 15-inch guns should form part of the defences.     LORD HAILSHAM remarked that it would  probably be at least three years before  the  15-inch guns with  their  mountings  could be installed  at Singapore.     SIR JOHN SIMON said  that  the point made by  Mr. Latham  was a perfectly good one,  but  he thought that nothing relating to the provision  of 15-inch guns would be likely to emerge for some time.     SIR GEORGE MILNE,  in reply  to the  Prime  Minister,  said  that while the actual 15-inch guns were available, the mountings were not, and it was the construction of the latter which involved time and money.   In addition, up-to- date ammunition would have to be manufactured.     MR.  LATHAM  said he thought  that these explanations covered his point.     LORD LONDONDERRY  drew  attention to  the  necessity for starting immediately on the provision of the necessary landing grounds.     SIR  WARREN FISHER,  in  reply  to the Prime  Minister, said that the view of the Treasury was that the ports  in question were at present obviously defenceless.   If it  was necessary to  have these defended ports they must  be defended, and he did not think that the Treasury could say more than that.     THE PRIME   MINISTER then   raised  the question  of  when  any announcement, if any, on the subject of Singapore should be made.     MR.  LATHAM  questioned  whether  there would be any need for a  public announcement.     THE  PRIME  MINISTER pointed out  that  it  was  universally  known that  work on the defences of  Singapore had been suspended, and it  was most probable that any decision now to proceed with them would leak out.     LORD HAILSHAM said  that  as  no  provision  would be made  before next  year&apos;s Estimates, there was no reason why this  should become known until next  year.     SIR  BOLTON  EYRES-MONSELL doubted  whether, even  then,  the provision made  for  Singapore would  be  particularly noticeable.   There  was always money shown under Vote 10 for continuing various work in hand.   All that would happen would be that some money would appear also under Votes 8-and  9.     THE PRIME MINISTER, while agreeing, emphasised  that a decision  to proceed now with Singapore did involve an alteration in policy.     SIR  JOHN  SIMON remarked that a decision  on Singapore was  really-connected with the bigger  question of the ten-year assumption, which would have to be considered.     SIR  GEORGE  MILNE observed  that, even if next year money could be provided for the mountings required at Singapore, it would not be necessary  to-state that these mountings were requiredjfor that particular fortress.     After some further discussion it was generally agreed          That there would be no necessity for a specific announcement that  it was     now proposed to proceed  with the defences of  Singapore,  though it was     recognised that questions might be asked in Parliament.     THE PRIME MINISTER then directed attention to conclusions (/) and (g) in the Report.    MR. BALDWIN said that his Committee attached considerable  importanceto these two recommendations.  As the Committee were aware, the question of
 Coast Defence had produced a good deal of friction, and it was most important that this should end.     THE PRIME MINISTER heartily concurred in this view, and asked that if any such difficulties recurred the Chiefs of Staff should approach him for help. He had, in fact, been hoping to have a friendly talk on such questions with the heads of the Fighting Services, but, unfortunately, he had been unable to do so, and now he had to go to Lausanne.  In any case, he hoped that everything possible would be done to promote cordial co-operation.     SIR JOHN SALMOND, referring to conclusion (/), in which it was recom- mended that practical trials should be arranged, stated that at present there was a shortage of coast defence units for this purpose.  If the recommendation was to be properly implemented, the Air Ministry would require financial assistance in forming a unit which could undertake the necessary co-operation.     THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Chief of the Air Staff should discuss this matter with the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.    MR.  LATHAM  asked  whether  the Board  referred  to in (/)  would be concerned only with  training and exercises,  or  whether  it would  advise on financial questions, such as that just raised by the Chief of the Air Staff.    THE PRIME MINISTER replied that the Board would be concerned only with  the technical aspect of  the trials.   As  he understood  it, the three Service Departments would have to consider separately what provision they would have to make to carry out this  recommendation.  If more money was required they would have to appixmch the Treasury.    SIR FREDERICK FIELD said that this had been the usual practice.  If, for example, the Admiralty were  contemplating breaking up a battleship, they always asked the other Departments if they would like to use it for any form oftrials. It seemed to him that in the present case the three Chiefs of  Staff shouldjointly consider what trials should be carried out, and then arrange for the three departments, in co-operation, to carry out these trials.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE  asrreed1       (I)  To  approve  the following  recommendations  by the  Coast Defence             Sub-Committee :                  &quot; (at) Coast  defences should  be  organised  on   a  basis  of          I   co-operation between the three Defence Services, the gun retaining          I   its place as the  main deterrent against Naval attack.                 (b)  At the same time, aircraft are a most important factor to          I   be reckoned with in considering both forms of attack and forms of          I   defence.  Their co-operation will always increase  the security of          1  the fortress and add to the deterrent effect of the fixed defences.  In          &apos;  the case of the more important naval bases their  co-operation is             essential.&quot;      (II)  To recommend the adoption of the following recommendations :         i        &quot; (c) We consider that  the first stage of  the  plan of defence             for the naval base at Singapore, modified in the light of the latest             developments  in coast artillery, should be proceeded with, including             the provision  of three 15-inch guns.  The second stage should await             a further recommendation by the Committee of Imperial Defence.                 (d)  In accordance  with  (&amp;), the  Royal  Air  Force  should             continue to co-operate in the defence of Singapore with such forces             as may,  from  time to time, be deemed desirable.  Such co-operation             should extend to all branches of the defence, including anti-aircraft-             defence (fighters), and offensive operations against aircraft carriers,             capital ships, and all other forms of attack by sea, land or air.                 (e)  The War  Office should be authorised to proceed, as financial             conditions permit, with  the schemes that have  been worked out for             rearming  coast  defences at other  ports, up  to  and  including
             9-2-inch guns, in such order of priority as may be approved from             time  to  time  by the  Committee  of Imperial Defence  on  the             recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.&quot;                 And that the financial  aspect should  be  left for consideration             between the Treasury and the three Service Departments.     (Ill) That it was unnecessary at the present juncture to make any public             announcement of  the intention to proceed with  the  defences  of             Singapore contrary to the decision made at the Imperial Conference             of 1930.     (IV) That the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee should consider             in the light of Conclusion (I) above the detailed naval, military and             air proposals for the defence of  the various  ports concerned, and             should submit their recommendations to the Committee  of Imperial             Defence for approval.      (V) That conclusion (/) of  the Report  recommending  arrangements  for             progressive training  and graduated practical  trials, with a view to             establishing the  principles  and  practice of  co-operation by  the             Royal  Air  Force in all  branches  of coast defence, should  be             approved.     Finally, the Committee expressed the earnest  hope that  the three defence services would  co-operate with the utmost cordiality  and  frankness  in giving-effect to the above recommendations.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        June 9, 1932.o
