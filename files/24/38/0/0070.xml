(&amp;X-3ZQQ1*Any scheme of self government for Ireland &quot;hich may be proposed by the Irish Convention will, I believe, reserve to the Imperial Parliament its present legislative authority over matters relating to (l)&apos;the Defence- of the .lealm and (?,) Harbours end Navigation.     But I think it &quot;mil also provide that the general executive Authority of the Crown in Ireland shall Be exercised by the Lord. Lieutenant on the. advise of on Irish administration responsible to an Irish Parliaments    The redistribution of functions which such a scheme involves must havo a serious bearing on national^ Defence, end would be attended with considerable risks if means for the Defence of Great Britain and Ireland as one unit are not definitely secured by the terms of any Home .Rule Aet which.may become law0In time of peace,the commend of harbours and approaches, coast defences, dockyards, camps? barracks., manoeuvre grounds, aerodromes, naval and&quot;military factories and sources of supply, means of communication, and all the other apparatus of Defence need to be beyond possibility of question, and in (or in preparation for; time of war it is essential that so soon as the emergency arises the Central Government shall have these complete means of controlling the possessions and capabilities of all persons which are being exercised at present by His Lajesty!s Government whether under the Royal Prerogative or by virtue of the . Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations or other legis-lative means.     The question now&quot;&quot;&apos;seems to be how best &quot;to ensure to the Crown in a Home Rule Act for Ireland ready and easy means of meeting both the above classes of needs without stirring up jealousy now or controversy hereafter*The matter arises at present under fairly favourable circumstances-     The Irish Convention is no doubt aware in a general way of the nature of the large problem involved in its reference to a, Sub-Committee of the question of Defence, though seme of its members are probably more concerned with the creation of a force for Home, - Defence in Ireland than with the part which Ireland should play in securing the common safety of the United Kingdom,     The Sub-Committee is so constituted, however, that discussion with, its Members of the whole Mavai and Military situation could be conducted under very advantageous conditions.     The two Nationalist members, Captain Grogon, M.P, and Captain Dor an, have both served at the front during a long period of the war with conspicuous seif-sacrificeo -Tney
They would, I believe, join with their colleagues in the elaboration of means by which the necessary powers of the Grown for a scheme of Defence common to Great Britain and Ireland should be safe-guarded, the mainten--aiice of the peace establishments placed beyond question, and the conditions agreed upon mcl declared in wnich the Grown could exercise the full authority with which   . it is armed for the Defence of the Realm in tine of war, -I think it is likely that a frank discussion of the problems of Defence with the Sub-Committee of the Convention by a capable staff-Officer or Officers would lead to their making a very useful report to the Convention, and to agreement in the Convention upon reasonable conclusions,(Signed).
