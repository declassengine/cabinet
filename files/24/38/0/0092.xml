Intelligence Bureau,SECRET.Department of Information. FSW/016.369WE3KLY   REPORT   ob   SPAIN,   XVI.(Jan. 9th, 1918)The problem which was unsolved three weeks ago when the last Report was written, has now been settled.     The Government has decided to dissolve Parliament and to leave the difficult question of the amnesty for the condemned strike-leaders over to the new Parliament,     The elections have been fixed for February 17th and the new Cortes ore to meet in March.     It is rumoured that owing to the recent attempt at some kind of mutinous action on the part of a large number of non-commissioned officers these dates may be changed for later ones*     But it is not likely that there will he any lengthy postponement.The decision to dissolve was taken against the open advice of most of the political leaders.     Snnor Alba, who aspires to the lead of the Mberal party and is appealing to the Left Wing in opposition to both of its old leaders, the Prime Minister and Count Romanones, made a speech at Seville on Dec 17th in which he too protested against a Dissolution and promised the Government the support of his group in the present Parliament.     But the- determination of the Regionalists to have a new Parliament has been decisive with the Cabinet, and the Royal decree oi Dissolution has been signed,     In this, as in other matters, their able leader Senor Cambo, has shwbn his power.   He has begun to prepare to raise funds for the purpose of the elections, a practice hitherto unknown in Spain.     The other parties are following his example.     What the result of the elections will be it   is of course impossible to say.     The Government certainly means to carry out in practice its declared policy of non-interference.     Its sub-stitutions of judges for the political Civil Governors as returning officers, and of elected Mayors and Councillors in place of officially
appointed ones,- are public steps openly taken as part of that policy and there seems no reason to doubt their sincerity.     The result will no doubt he that the Regionalists will win mdre seats than they have ever held beforei especially in Catalonia and Galicia, where there are strong &apos;Home Rule&apos; tendencies, and the voters are more independent,for various reasons, one of them being that these provinces \ especially Galicia, send a great many emigrants to South America^ whose money enables their relations at home to be independent of the political Cacique1 (&quot;boss&quot;) and whose ideas when they themselves return home, as they constantly do, are also of an independent order.     It is probable also that the Republicans will gain some seats.     But the best opinion, supported by such evidence as existst it3 that no very startling change will take place.     It is noticed that an immense majority of the freely elected Mayors were Liberals and Conservatives of the old monarchical type.    Again it is likely that there will be some kind of understand-ing between the old parties, arranging the results in many constituen-cies.     And it   is pointed out that after all even if the official Government influence disappears from elections, other and very potent influences remain .     The Government used to control the elections through the Caciques&apos;.   The Government is now to retire, but the cacique has not retired and will not.     The local magnate, the land-lord, or the employer, or the wirepuller, will still return the can-didate of his choice, and the aotual voters, in a country so unedu-cated and unpolitical as Spain, will in a large number of constituencies have very little to do with the business.     Still even a nominally free election, whioh will be really free in the more advanced towns, wilt be a gain.     It will produce a Parliament which will at any rate have more authority to soeak in the name of   the country than the old ones which were the product of elections so undisguisedly and cynically &apos;managed&apos; by Madrid that before they took place the papers could announce the
number of Liberal and Conservative Deputies to be returned.   Nobody can pretend to da that with any confidence now.     It is not more than a strong probability that the Government will have a majority. Most people, including Count Ramantnes who is $f course not a member of it, think it will, but nobody can tell what sort of a majority it will have.     How much effect German intrigue and   bribery may have will probably not become immediately apparent:   f*r their arrangements are not likely to court daylight and their Deputies, if they get any. will masquerade as free and independent members *f the ordinary parties.     The Prime Minister declares that he will severely repress bribery even with imprisonment, and privately adds that he will not have a Germanophil Parliament.     In saying this he probably relies on the supntrt of Romenones and Datot but there is reason to believe that Dato may prefer to use the advantage offered to the Conservatives by the Liberal split.whatever the result of the eleotions there is no reason to expeot any important change in Spanish foreign polioy.     It will take more that a few bought Deputies to alter the truth that Spain cannot afford to quarrel with the Western Powers with whom her destiny is bound up and with whom she is united , as even Senor Maura has ad-mitted, by   the facts of geography and by economio and intellectual relations.     That this is generally recognised by the leaders of Spanich opinion is shown by the fact that in the recent crisis not only Alhucemas bpt even Maura asked the Marquis of Lema, the pro-Ally Foreign Minister of the Dato Cabinet, to remain In offioe, although his doing so was violently objected to by the pro-German nress. Policy will therefore remain mildly pro-Ally.   But administration is a different matter.     If, for instance, the Government should agree, under p-^sure of their need of cotton, oil and other things
- 4 -which they can only get from the \llies, to accept the suggestion madeto them by some of the Allies, th/1 they should intern in the interiorof Spain the crews of German refugee vessels who are believed to beactive in assisting the operations of German submarines, the actualadministration of such a policy would lie with a host of of. icialswho are   more or less oro-Germans and very onen to corruption andintimidation by the army of Germans now living in Spain.     Stillsuch an order, even if improperly executed, would be something tothe good, and it is to be honed that it may be fine of the resultsof the Franco-American negotiations which are now being carried on.It is to be honed also that our own Financial Mission will success-fully settle the Exchange difficulty by means of a Spanish Loan orotherwise.     After all the Allies who cammand so much that Spainwants have unanswerable^arguments if   they choose to use them.These foreign questions will probably occupy the new Parliamentless than the domestic situation in which the immediate problemswill be first, the amnesty question which will almost certainly besettled by the amnesty being granted:   second, the difficultiesabout the Army, ?&quot;.nd third, the failure of food end transport.   TheArmy could probably make a Revolution in Spain as it has just donein Portugal.     The oificers&apos; Juntas (or Committees) use very highlanguage:   they have uoset two Cabinets, and the present Minister,La Cierva, makes them flattering speeches, has incited two delegatesfrom each Committee to confer with hitfjm, and has desired the Press notto discuss their doings.     The King has never given a sign of nossess-ing the courage to resist them.     Romanones openly regards them asa very grave danger and some people regard it as v possibility that maythey/make a Government of their own under La Cierva who is fin able and not too scrupulous man.     But it is hg no means certain that he is sincerely on their side:   and in some quarters it is suggested
!that the revolutionary plot announced last week as having.been dis-covered among the non-commissioned officers and successfully suppres-Jged by the energy of the Minister, who dismissed 1500 of them fromthe Army, was exaggerated for the puroose of providing a text on thevalue of discipline and a weapon against the officers&apos; own Committees,The sergeants, it is announced, were all made to take an oath theywould have nothing to do with any kind of sergeants&apos; union or Junta,and those who refused were dismissed.     la Cierva and public opinionagenerally will now be able to say to the officers, &quot;You see how/bad example spreads:   your own control of your regiments will soon be at an end if the army learns the lesson of defying authority&quot;.    Such a sermon might find easier acceptance if, as is said, the Juntas of different towns and of different branches of the Service are by no means agreed among themselves, and if they, as well as all moderate men in Spain, are far from finding the Russian Revolution an experience that invites imitation in a country which enjoys all the forms and many of the realities of liberty.     Even many leaders of the Extreme Left are said to have been alarmed into moderation by the spectacle c of the Russian catastrophe.The food and transport difficulty has become very serious in Spain as it has nearly everywhere else.     It is aggravated in Spain by a prolonged drought which has continued for many months.     It is said that the corn sown this autumn has never come up.   The railway trans port, never efficient in Spain, has grown worse through lack of coal and through the disaffection and sabotage of many of the rail-wayman who demand the reinstatement of men dismissed at the time of the strike in the summer.     The German press uses all these diffi-culties fox propaganda purposes;    in particular constantly urging that the food shortage is due to the exports sent to the Ulies.    It is unnecessary to remark that no corn is exported to us by Spain and
little food except wine and fruit.     Some pro-Ally papers reply by asking how much food is consumed by the 70,000 or 80,000 Germans now in Spain.     Whatever the cause the result is serious and mifcghi have serious politioal results:   for the Army might not suopress riots due to starvation aS obediently as it did the political riots tff last summer.It may be noted that at Jeast one oro-Oerman paper is suggesting that on the Allied principles of self-determination and np annexations Gibraltar must be returned to Spain after Peace,o---------- . -------
