EOEET,AIR   RAIDS.REPORTS OF INQUESTSWith reference to Minute (l) of the War Cabinet Meeting held on the 26th December, I do not think that it would be advisable altogether to prohibit the publication of the reports of inquests upon the victims of air raids.The public have always been sceptical as to the number of casualties officially announced, and the fact that Inquests are held in all cases of death and the results are published in the Press has a steadying influence and goes far to discredit alarmist reports. Moreover on several occasions the Coroners have called the attention of the public to the fact that death has occurred owing to neglect upon the part of the deceased to take cover or obey other instruc-tions issued by the Authorities.I will,   however, ask the Press Bureau to revise and consolidate their instructions to the Press as to the reports of these inquests and to include a   prohibition of any account of the nature of the injuries inflicted and also the publication of photographs of personsinjured.G. CAVE.January, 1918,4F114,
