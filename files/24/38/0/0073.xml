Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.With reference; to Sir Auckland Geddas&apos; Memorandum (N.S.R.25) on this subject, I understand that he has withdrawn the proposal originally set out in B of the Draft Order, a course which makes it unnecessary for me to trouble the War Cabinet with certain objections which I should otherwise have been obliged to raise in the interests of the restoration of trade after the war.I feel however that It is most important that these interests should be regularly borne in mind when proposals for the diver-sion of labour are under consideration, and I should be glad to have the agreement of the War Cabinet to the following propositions(a)&apos; where it Is necessary to divert labour from civil to war work it is desirable, from the point of view of the post-war restoration of trade$ to proceed wherever possible by converting the factories with their existing labour to war purposes rather than by actually removing the labour,(b) In any case where the diversion or removal of labourmay involve the extinction of an industry the Industries Committee should, be consulted before any action is taken.CHRISTOPHER ADDIS ON.8th January 1918,
