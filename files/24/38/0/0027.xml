imports m nmosffl in Esu-noN to SHi?Piro.VmsoU REVIEW Q? 1917ill Gjv; v 1st January, 19181, As it is now possible to form reliable estimates for theconcluding period of 1917, a review can be presented at once of the present position in relation to previous years and futurevprosp ects.2. It is not possible to give exact figures of imports for waryears because of the large quantities of goods brought into the Country by the Government which have not till recently appeared in the trade accounts.    But, making rough estimates, the total imports into the United Kingdom (including Government goods thaw have not appeared.in the Trade Accounts) may be put approximate-ly as followsi-Tons weight1913..........................   54:500,000]0&apos;io 4-n 000 &quot;0001917 (parbiy estimated).........   33;000;0001918 (expected),........,;..-....   32,000,000The decline in 1917 on 1913 is about 30 per cent.In order to secure that the inevitable reduction should be as little injurious as possible, a policy of import restriction has been practised to protect the more essential imports.    It was introduced in February 1916, the items then affected being Furniture Woods, Hardwoods and Veneers, Tobacco, Stones and Slates, and Paper and Paper Making Materials.    The imports of Paper and Paper Making Materials were to be controlled by a special commission and the imports reduced by l/3rd. of those in 1914.    During- 1916 the list was gradually extended (partly with the object.of reducing the unfavourable trade balance by limiting the import of luxuries or superfluities) but the additions did not, for the most part, affect any large group of imports.    The saving effected was about li million tons, a year,i    These figures differ slightly from those given in the lastWatson-Eiderton Report as different conversion factors were used in bringing other units of quantity to tons weight.
On February 16th 1917 the policy was extended to add eventually 6,000,000 tons a year to the amount saved, which was afterwards raised to 7,200,000.    Restrictions were made more stringent upon goods already subject to licence, but most of the extra saving was to be obtained from the addition of numerous articles to the restricted list.    By far the most important of these was Timber.    Of the total extra saving, half was to come from a reduction in the im-ports of timber. though it was realised that it would take some little time before the rate of reduction aimed at could be reached.    Vigoious steps were taken to increase the supplies of home grown timber and to make more use of French timber for military purposes in France, with the result that the original estimates of the reduction possible are being much exceeded.    The following Table shows imports of goods on and off the restricted list.Thousands of Tons.	Import of Restricted Goods..	Import of Unrestric t-ed Goods.

In addition certain economies were arranged for in &quot;browing&quot; -and other directions and importation for re-export was to be curtailed..   ..hen account is taken of these it becomes apparent   that the programme of the Cabinet is being more than fully realised. &apos;In connection with the contraction of unessential imports it must be remembered that the -Jnitod Kingdom is very much less solf sufficing in foodstuffs and raw materials than is, say, the,United States.      Thus in normal times theUnited Kingdom imports about -g of its wheat supply, nearlying by metal contents).    Imports of manufactured goods are comparatively unimportant.   In view of the staple character of most of the imports it is very difficult to reduce the volume of imports by a large percentage especially at a time when the demand in certain directions is abnormally great. Unessential imports have been largely reduced or entiroly stopped.    Of other commodities the import has been diminshec by effecting an increase in the home output, and a good doal has been done, in addition, to economise shipping space by importing goods from the nearest sources ratherthan from those which are more distant.   It is impossible to saw what proportion of the Imports in 1917&apos; are for war purposes, but it is significant that more than 90 per cent are supervised and arranged for by the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of umit ions,the  var Of rice, the admiralty and the Timber Controller.&apos; It msut not be inferred from this, of course, that absolutely all the imports demanded by -far Departments are for Jar use.   Certain parts of them are assigned for civilian use, but as they are more or loss controlled by- these departments, and the &quot;?ar demands are enormous, the quantities released..for civilian use mean greatly reduced consumption.all its raw tortile materials, and half its iron ore (reckon-
1 S31 O VThe large reduction in imports discussed above, has of course, been msde necessary by the difficulties in the shir/oin?? i:osition.   By i-fov-mber 30th, 1917 the. gross loss of British merchant shipping through enemy action had amounted since the beginning of the war to 5/750,000 tons.      hen marine losses are added to this and replace-ments by new building, prizes, requisitions and so forth substracted, the net loss amounts to some .3/700,000 tons. The grand total of tonnage left to us   of steam merchant vessels over 500 tons was on November 30th about 15,850,000 tons.   This figure   does not, however, represent available tonnage; for it. includes vessels repairing, and vessels launched but not completed, amounting in all to over one million tons.    The corresponding figure under these heads in July 1914 cannot well have exceeded half a million tons.. Therefore, the reduction in our available tonnage since the beginning of the war may be put at betwen 3 and 3y million tons, leaving on November 30th about 14,800,000 tons.On October 31st 1917 - the last date for which exact figures are available - our available tonnage was being employed as follows:-,T fls..Service of the Army and ^avv____...... 3,763,000Service of Allies..................... 1,626/000Colonies.............................692,000Permanentlyr.abroad and coasters 1,275,000Oilers................&apos;....... 1,013,000ailaxLe for British tradeother than oilers).................... 6,469,000Total available:-    14,838,000
Theie figures make plain the very large extent to which Great Britain is employing her reduced shipping tonnage in thecommon war interests of the Allies.   Practically all the vessels &apos;permanently abroad5 that are of a kind suitable for general trade have been withdrawn, and the service of the Colonies has been greatly curtailed.   It must be remarked further that, of the tonnage set out in the above Table as available for British trade, a very large portion is engaged, not in importation for civilian needs, but in the direct war service of bringing to this country munitions and&apos;munition materials.Great efforts have been made to employ the reduced tonnage available for British imports in a more economical and efficient manner.   Cargo liners have been diverted from Australasia to the Atlantic, and ether similar changes, sometimes involving a loss of trade which may be permanent, have been made.   As a result, whereas compared with October, 1916, the tonnage available for British trade has fallen about V7%, British entrances were down cn the average of August, September and October - the position was worse in November - only about half this amount.   Further a great deal has been accomplished in increasing the proportion of imports that are brought in per ton of shipping entered.   As. compared with...1516, the improvement in this respect has probably been at least Vfi, whereas against 1913, it has probably amounted to over 40)b.   In the light of these facts, the country cannot be accused of slackness in meeting the difficulties to which the submarine war has given rise.The preceding discussion relates to British tonnage only; but the position of Allies and Neutrals must also be taken into account.   Neutral,ships are used by us and.our. Allies, and may be transferred to British or Allied flags, and as the shipping of our Allies fails, there is an increasing strain upon our Merean-tile Marine,-.    The figures below, seme of whioh are rough . estimates and approximations, show the gravity of the situation, which is represented broadly- in the following Table&quot;:-
November 30th. 1917. Losses and Beplacements during the War.Gross tons.-Tar Losses of British Vessels 5,800,000&quot; &quot;    Allied       &quot; lt900t000&quot; &quot;    Neutral      11 1,900,0009^600^000&quot;&quot;*Total Marine and Other Losses 1,700,000Ships repairing or detained throughenemy action &quot;     1,400,000Total 12.700,000Deduct.New1 construction, say    5,100,000Prizes and detained ^vessels        1,900,000       7,000,000Total net loss:       5,700,000Broadly put, the fleets which have sustained the loss shown in this Table amount now to some 30,000,000 gross tons,; of which about one half is British, while about 3/5ths of the remainder is Allied.;rith these developments in mind we may proceed to consider the prospects of importation in 1918.   On the basis of estimates furnished by the Admiralty, the Shipping Controller reckons that   assuming Great Britain to provide for the carriage of two million extra tons of cereals to make good the deficient har-vests of France and Italy, the imports into tho United kingdom itself will probably have to be reduced in 1918 below tho 1917 level, by the equivalent of more than 6 million tons carried.the average length of voyage.
It is necessary also to consider the position in 1919.     It is   estimated that shipbuilding in this Country and the United States will somewhat exceed British, Allied -and relevant neutral losses together during 1918.    Thus, at the beginning of 1919, the    4 % shipping position should be no worse than at the Vanning of 1918, but we could only be sure of its proving materially better if shipbuilding programmes were enlarged.    Also there remain the claims of the American Army.    Thus it is unlikely that our importing power will actually be higher in 1919 than in 1918, and it may well be lower.Towards meeting the anticipated diminution   in our imports in 1918, tho Cabinet Committee on Bestric-tion of imports has already recommended reductions on 1917 amounting nominally to 5,550,000 tons, but as a considerable part of the proposed restrictions affect articles which come on short voyages (timber and paper-pulp) or as ballast (stonos &amp; slates) we should hardly expect the proposals to reSuit in an effective saving of as much as 5 million tons.As these proposals bring us within sight of the irreducible minimum, thore is added a rough and provisional survey of future possibilities in the way of reducing imports:-(a) Seduction of stocks.   This is a form of saving that can be effected, only once.   Stocks-of the things least essential, for the prosecution of the War have already been depleted to mere working margins in most cases.     Our industries have been living on them throughout 1917.    Stocks of food (including flocks and herds) and munitions are obviously our ultimate reserves held against unlikely calamities, and it : would therefore seem most unwise to reduce them materially, except under absolute guarantee of their restoration after a. short interval. &apos; (7)      .
(b) ffood rationing.      It is not known whether the Minister of Pood has estimated the possible giving, if any under this Head, but it cannot be very large, 3)pvfilnpmflnt of home sunolios:-(a) It is understood that trie increase in home-grown foodmay possibly allow of the reduction of annual imports after the Autumn of 1918 by 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 tons.(b) Development of home-grown timber supplies may con-ceivably yield another 500,000 tons eventually.(c) The further utilisation of home ores for steel pro-duction would save on imported ores, but more plant is needed to extract a given quantity of metal from.home ores than from the richer imported ores, and steel furnaces have to-be adapted to deal with the product from home ores, In twelve months a very large extension and conversion of ; plant could not reasonably be looked for.Reduced use of Munition:-      This would presum-ably weaken.our war offert and lengthen the war, if it did not shorten.it by insuring tho defeat of the Allies. (A) Reduced, imports of materials for non-essential exports and home QQas,ump.tiQii*   This means unemployment in most cases in which tho saving would bo substantial as far as can be gefa-n now, and so far as the exports are affected, a foreign exchange problem as well as one oi&quot; finance.   As a result.of the most drastic action,,.litmore than 1,000,000 tons could bo saved .   and such curtailment would be most disastrous for the prosecution of the wax. (q) Miscellaneous Import^-   After the cut of 1918, there are not likely to be many things left which are both not essential and take tonnage that could be used for other purposes,.. &apos; vOn
\0n the whole it would seem that without a serious reduction of our reserves of essentials the saving after 1918 could not at the outside exceed half the saving proposed to he made in 1918, while widespread unemployment would he one of the eonse-quences of curtailment to anything like that extent.The most important practical conclusion suggested as a result of this survey is that the present shipbuilding prospects appear, so far as they are known, to be inadequate, in view of the facts fa) that we are near the limit of saving on imports (b) that the war claims on tonnage may increase, fc) that the losses may be greater than are now anticipated, and (d)that a large imerican Army has to be moved and maintained.     Shipping is now the limiting factor and may remain so, if the output of ships is not largely increased.       To remove all fear of our being seriously hampered by shortage of ships, it is estimated by competent authorities that this country and the United States jointly should work up to a shipbuilding rate of 9,000,000 gross tonnage per annum by next Autumn.A.H.
