;St  &quot;DOCUMENT IS ,^l?HOFH!RTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJSSTY^S GOV^RNMENT 4-..168RE T.- 3233WAR CABINET.THE SITUATION IN IRELAND..Memo random &quot;by the Chief Secretary fo  J^oiand.Xftor a year of.very varied troubles Ireland appears at tho moment to &quot;be making some progress toward quietude and reason.  - Without abatement of the general demand in great part of the country for a change in the system of government or increase of general goodwill toward Great Britain or repudia-tion of the idea among the minority of readiness to fight for independence,   there is evidence- in fitany quarters of better appreciation of, and increased readiness to accept the facts of the existing situation.     There is also less general encouragement and indeed less toleration of violence.     On the whole the outlook is less threatening than it was twelve months or six months or three months ago, anil although appearances are notoriously deceptive in Ireland, and an untoward incident might raise new troubles, my advisers think there is a reasonable proupect of definite improvement.Among the factors which, have tended to encourage a more reasonable temper, I reckon the free discussion which has gone on of the aims and method of the rebel elements,, the disillusionment of many with regard to German intentions and any hopes founded thereon, the changed attitude ftf the United Statew, and the proof which has been befnre the ^es of all classes throughout the country that the military power of England is sufficient at any rate to bring actual rebellion to a fatal close.     The Roman clergy have ranged themselves generally if somewhat cautiously against disorder.   The well-to-do classes, including/
practically all tho farmers,.do not encourage the violent factions.   The advocacy of rebellion has ceased to enjoy the popularity it lately had ,   Attempts which the Sinn Fein executive had planned for getting control of food supplies and involving the farmers in an anti-British combination appear to have failed, at any rate for the present.So far as regards the assembling, arming drilling and marching of revolutionary volunteers, the action taken under Defence Regulations had a less satisfactory effect than was hoped for .   Hunger striking, and the unfortunate death of Thomas a she, made a complete and systematic enforcement of the Regulations impossible.Drilling goes on, but with much less zest and at present on a diminishing scale .     The Military Authorities and constabulary agree that from the standpoint of a possible outbreak it has become insignificant..This does not mean, unfortunately, that there is not a &quot;physical force&quot; section still active in some ports of the country .   Explosives and arms are still being collected by adherents of the Irish Republican Brotherhood ,   Theft In this country and Illicit purchases in Great Britain account for the explosives which these desperadoes become possessed of., and the arms are obtained partly by theft from barracks and from soldiers on leave and partly by raiding lonely houses where there are shotguns and sporting rifles.   These operations though perhaps not urgently serious from a military point of view, shew persistence of unsettled conditions.   This week an old man -an army pensioner     who struggled with a raiding party in a remote part of Worth Tipperary to prevent their carrying off the rifle of his soldier son, was murderously shot in the struggle and has died of his wounds .   The district is being diligently scoured by police and troops, whose activity will, I hope, have a good effect,   The army authorities also are at length placing the weapons of soldiers on leave under better control.   I reckon that during the year the army has lost in Ireland nearly a hundred good rifles .
Among the least satisfied critics of the passivity if the Civil Executive at some trying periods ef the past-yeaxfhaye been the Intelligence Officers in the several military iis^rixrts^ in Ireland.   It is interesting therefore t* quote for th-G &apos; information of the Cabinet stme passages in the report for the period ending at December 31st Of one Of their&apos; Officers who deals with the Munster command * that whi&apos;eh comprises four fifths of the area where definite trouble has arisen from the more bellicose activities of the Sinn Fein&quot;.   This officer says:-1.        There is a distinct improvement in the&quot;state of the area since my last report.   A; large number of reports are still made, by the police.if small bases of illegal drilling, but the number is decreasing,.   A more impar-tant feature to notice is; that the&apos; drill is of no mill--tary value whatever, and is carried on by persons unable to dd more for the most part than form an awkward squad into-fours.   The names cf meet of the persons imprisoned during the summer months for illegal drilling are new missing from the reports, and it is being carried on by obsoure individuals anxious to bring themselves into sufficient prominence to be arres-ted and imprisoned for a while, and thereby to secure a claim on the Sinn Fein Funds*   In Co. Clare, two men who had been Kon the run&quot; for two menthe or more tried to surrender to the police, who recommended that they should be simply ignored.   The number ofcases , reported for the week ending December 9th, 16th, and 23rd, were 74,40 and 43 -respectively*   Nearly half cf these cases come.from ,the county of Clare.   The prisoners, tried and untried,- who were released from Cork Gaol by order of the Civil Government about 2Ct.h November under the; &quot;Cat*and-Mouse Act&quot;, and who should have reported there, oh&apos;1.2th December, did not, it is needless -to say, return there of their own accord, and so far as I am aware, no attempt has been made to -re-arrest them.   Perhaps the wiser course has been adopted in leaving them alone.-   Information has reached me that It is gcsVing less easy than it was to get men to turn out for drill parades and route marches.   This is partly due to the wintry weather,&quot;hut mainly to another oause,  namely that route marching has been wearing out their boots, and boots nowadays are very expensive to replace.The parades of 506 or 800 m&apos;en who used to march cut of Cork every Sunday are now.gradually ceasing2.        An extensive tour of Countypork was Undertaken by de Valera and J.jWalsh during the fornight following the 8th December,&apos;   I was myself present at his. meeting in .Cork on 9th instant, at which a large number of \ people were present, probably-from- six to&apos; eight &apos;&quot;   &apos;thousands.   About one third of these were his followers
and fee remaining two thirds-were quite apathetic, and had merely attended out of curiosity.     The tour in the country towns wap most disappointing, from the Sinn Fein point of .  view.   The attendance at the meetings was poor,, and the young men of the Kanturk, Skibbereen, and other places - listened to the orators out of the windows, but declined to march with the-Volunteers.   Valsh made vitriolic comments on their absence at more than one meeting.   It may he that the Sinn Fein &quot;boom&quot; has passed its zenith.   The general prosperity of the farmers and disinclination for any further rebellion, and the gradual coming out into the open of individual Roman Catholic Bishops and Parish Priests in opposition to the absurd nonsense talked about an &quot;Irish Republic and the appearance of Ireland at the &quot;Peace Con-ference, are having their effect.     The &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;martyrs&quot; -released in June 1917 are losing their freshness and novelty, and while the leaders and extremists are and will remain as fanatical as ever, the movement is losing the support given it by the general public for the lack of any really material grievance to agitate about, such as the land question 50 years ago.   The leaders contradict them-selves and each other in every fresh speech they make, and there is no practicable policy advocated,.3. For tho reasons given in the preceding paragraphs, Iam of opinion that there is a slackening of support to the Sinn Pein movement, except by those who hope to make something out of it, and unless the Military.Service Act be applied to Ireland, which at present seems unlikely, this.slackening may continue.Among pacifying influences which have been recently at work in Ireland and the Convention is important.   The past week hasseen a series of sittings which mark the commencement of the mostits- -Berious stage of/proceedings..   As I mentioned in a previous memorandum, there ia a provisional scheme in view for an Irish Parliament so constituted as to secure a balance of numbers as between nationalists and Unionists.   This week&apos;s discussions have been concerned with the question of taxation and of the division   of fiscal control between the Imperial and Local Authorities.   The motion before the Convention was one moved by Lord Midleton on behalf of the Southern Unionists in the following termsThat, in the event of the establishment of an Irish Parliament, there shall be reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom full authority for all Imperial services, including the levying of Customs duties&quot;,, but subject to the above limitations ihe Irish parliament shall control all purely Irish services, including Judicature and Police with Internal taxation and administration,
The weeks Debates are spoken of by tho S3 who have heard them in terras of very high appreciation.   At the adjourment -which fortunately is an adjournment for ten days, so far as regards their motion - the position is that Lord Midletonls proposal has secured the support not only of the Southern Unionists in the Convention, but of many of the nominated mumbers , most (I believe all&apos; except one) of the Labour men, the Southern Unionist Alliance , the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Cork Chamber of Commerce and I have some reason for thinking that most, if not all of Mr. Redmond1s supporters would agree upon it if general agreement could thereby be arrived at .   Many will, I believe do so in any event.   What seems to me likely is the absolute or conditional concurrence of 75 or 80 per cent of the members of the Convention.   Then would arise the critical occasion ?;hich I forecasted some time since when the Government would have to decide whether such a consensus Is the &quot;Substantial agreement&quot; upon which it kas promised that legislative action should be taken.   At present there is, I believe, no likelihood that the Ulster Unionist Members will agree upon Lord Kidleton&apos;s motion, nor is it certain that the Nationalists as a whole will do so. Mr. W.M. Murphy who expresses more extreme views than Mr. Redmond is demanding complete fiscal independence , and will probably use his very popular newspaper, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; to enforce this demand when the question comes later to be publicly discussed.   But the day is drawing near and I think is hot mere than two months distant when proposals such as those I have mentioned above for a.^balanced1 Parlia-ment in Dublin with a division of fiscal control between Westminster and Dublin may be recommended by the most repre-sentatlve spokesmen of northern Ireland as the ..\^a sis of a scheme of Irish self-government.(sd,?)&apos; h.s. duke:Dublin Castle ,5th January , 1918 .
