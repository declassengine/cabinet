iovernment)Memorandum by the Ministry of Shipping on &apos;   &quot;/Colonial Office papers G.T.3160 &amp; 3260.The position in regard to the South African Wool appears to be that the War Office have sought to buy the South African Clip   on the   same relative basis as the Australasian. This   proposal ignored the superior geographical position of South Africa which   enables the South African Wool to command far wider alternative markets than are   open to Australasia. Therefore while part of the South African growers accepted the Y7ar Office proposals under various forms of pressure, a larger part did not accept and - are   now reaping the benefit of their refusal.This places the South African Government in a   position of some&apos;embarrassment vis a vis the   growers who accepted the Far Office proposals, as the latter feel not unnaturally that they are   paying rather dearly for their loyalty.It is now   proposed by the South African Government to ask the Imperial Government to release these growerd   from theirbargainsThe Ministry of Shipping desires to point out that thereare serious objections to this proposal from the tonnage point ofview unless the War Office are prepared to do without altogethersuch part of the wool, whioh they anticipated   getting from SouthAfrica, as is lost by releasing the   growers from their contracts.The shipping position   is not such as would enable the additionalquantity to be drawn from Australasia..As an alternative therefore the Ministry of Shippingsuggest that the whole of the South African Clip should bepurchased by the Imperial Government at some price which reflectsathe superior ability of South Africa to find/market!., the   termsof
