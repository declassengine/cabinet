&quot;pOCUMMT IS THE PBGEESHTY OF HIS BHITAimiC MAJ3STY*S (WVBIfflHSET .      QS g G 3 S ITfAR CABIBET SITUATION Iff GEEM1IY lote by Sir Edward CarsonI think my colleagues should sec- the enclosed letter which was written by Mr.ford - formerly the &quot;Morning Post&quot; correspondent at Berlin, now in Berne.     In vie?/ of the very emphatic assurances that have been given mo by the &quot;Morning Post&quot; that Mr.Ford is very level-headed and absolutely to be trusted in any&quot; information he gives, I think this paper is worth circulating.(Sgda ) EDWARD OABSOH2,Whitchall Gardens, S.W./1 January 9th,1918&quot;On the morning of tho 26th December, the day on which I returned here, I met someone who had arrived straight.from Berlin on the evening of the previous day.     I was urgently requested not to mention the name in a letter, for if the letter should go astray and fall into wrong hands, the con-sequences&apos; would be very serious to several persons,     ^or the same reason I was forbidden to publish the information given me, especially as it could easily be traced through me.     I have complete trust in the person who gave me the information, which I now relate to you from memory, as told to mo:The situation in Berlin is absolutely awful.     For the great mass of the population there is hardly any light, warmth, clothing or boots, and an appalling lack of food.     The work of the city is carried on by decrepit men, and by women who are reduced to nearly the same conditions     &quot;On one occasion I saw a coal cart, with Hussian prisoners in the driver*s seat,, and four women literally in rags, carrying the bags of coal into a house.&quot;     The linen worn by both sexes is abominably dirty, for there is no soap with which to wash it. - There is an intensely bitter feeling among the people against the Government, and there would undoubtedly be a revolt, but for the fact, as the people are always saying, that &quot;women cannot make a revolution&quot;.     The Government knows all this, and forbids able-bodied men returning to Berlin from the Front.     Officers are .   allowed to return there only in exceptional circumstances. Hindenburg is loathed by the people of Berlin,-     Placards with the picture of Hindenburg (such as those with Eitchererrs picture in England at the beginning of the war) urging tho population to subscribe to loans, to hold out, etc, aretorn off by the people, though in South Germany they are not touched.All over Berlin little notices are posted up, offering a reward of 3,000 marks to anyone giving informa-tion of persons who say anything against the Government, the Emperor, the war, or officers.     The population of Berlin is divided roughly into three classes.     The upper, military class, which adores Hindenburg and hates Dudendorff; tho middle class which loves Luddndorff, because he gives high posts in the Army to Jews - Jews are making vast
out of the war -5and the lower working class, which loathes Hindenburgh, luden&amp;Orff, and especially the Emperor.     This latter class ridicules the Crown Prince most unmercifully. Otherwise nobody speaks of the lap eric-1 family, which has ceased to be a dominant factor.The well-to-do classes get along fairly comfortably, because the necessaries of life can be purchased if one can afford to give fabulous sums for them.     A ham, for example, can be bought for  14.A s-pecial dinner air a restaurant for 3 people, costing  2:10:0, consisted of soup that was practically warm water, some tiny fishes (&quot;people now eat the fishes heeds&apos;1) a fragment of some sort of meat j a few carrots, and a piece of turnip boiled in.water, and some pudding that was uneatable.     Some officers were dining at a neighbouring table and one of themsaid, ,vThe English have already won the war&quot;, for which he was taken severely to task by the others.The news is circulated sub-rosa among officers that as the result of a recent fire or explosion at Krupp1s, 250 new aeroplanes were destroyed.     Officers also know that the Turks are utterly sick of the war.     It is said that the Turks hoped we would get through the Dardanelles, and that had we done so they would have fallen on the necks of the English soldiers.It appears that in the early stage of the peace negotia-tions, some German officers of high rank who had gone to a Russian camp, were shot on the way back.     The father of one of them, a very high personage, ms influential enough to obtain permission to bring the dead officer to his home for burial.     He tooh a coffin with him, but on his arrival the other Gorman officers refused to help him carry the coffin and place the corpse In it, on the ground that they had to be buried where they fell.Everything is being moved to the West, and wherever it can be done, double&quot;lines of rails are being laid, vh ich also consoles the people&apos;, vvhb believe this will enable the food to arrive more quickly from Russia,The journey from Berlin to Basel included a whole night in a train without light, very cold, and with no opportunity of obtaining food of any kind, or anything to drink,I have received a verbal message from my friend Williams, the British Chaplain in Berlin.     He says:     &quot;We are going through Hell here&quot;, and when a clergyman, and especially one such as Williams says that, things must be very bad.     The authorities still permit Williams to hold regular services at the English Church.     last Sunday morning the congregation numbered about 50 persons.     I sun^ose they were Americans and the English wives of Germans.&quot;&apos;
