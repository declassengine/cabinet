SECR E.T.      &apos; ;C0^ N0-   14B.-E.F.4/26.Secretary,War Cabinet.With reference to the Proceedings of the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 7th instant,. I forward a Memorandum I have received from Field-Marshal Sir D. Haig.(Sdo) F,- Maurice..D..M.O..War Office, S,W.1* 9th January, 1918,
The Chief of tho Imperial General Staff, War Office,In reply to the question put by Sir Edward Carson to me at the meeting of th** War Cabinet&apos; on the morning of the 7th January, 1918, as to whether I thought that the military position in 6 or 12 months,&apos; time would show improvement from our point of view, I stated at the time that I had not the facts or figures upon which to base a reply.I have now seen the report of the Man-Power Committee and the remarks of the Army Council thereon, and I beg to state that I am in full agreement with the latter0In my opinion, the crucial period for the Allies is the next few months.   During this period the Central Powers may make a determined effort to force a decision on the Western front, that is, on the Italian, French or British fronts.   As I stated yesterday to the War Cabinet, I regard such an effort on the part of the enemy in the light of a gamble with the determination to risk everything in order to secure an early and favourable decision.Provision, however, musty in my opinion, be made to meet such an eventuality and to replace the losses ?/hich would certainly be incurred in withstanding a heavy and sustained attack.     It is really immaterial whether, the attack were to be delivered against the Italian, the French or the British,. If, for example, the French were heavily attacked as at Verdun in 1916, the British would be unable to relieve the pressure by delivering a counter offensive as was done on the Somme in July 1916. .   The only means of relieving the pressure would be either to send British reserves to the assistance of theFrench
French or to take over more of the French front, thus releasing French troops. Either of these courses would possibly involve the weakening of the British front to a dangerous degree.The steps proposed in the report of the Man-Power Committee appear to involve a steady diminution of the British forces in France during the coming year and are therefore quite inadequate to meet the situation which would arise in the event of a serious and sustained offensive by the enemy in the Spring. Consequently the defensive power of the Allies on the Western front in the event of such an offensive on the part of the enemy would give cause for anxiety,.The military position in six to twelve months&apos; time will depend on hew we have weathered the intervening period, our losses^ and our ability to replace wastage and bring our units up to establishment,      If steps are taken to secure the necessary reinforcements without delay, and these,  as I have already stated previously, may amount to 100,000 men per month in the event of a serious and sustained attack by the enemy, there is no doubt that we might confidently expect an improvement in the military situation.With the successful repulse of the enemyls attackss with full cadres and adequate reinforcements, and with the accession of American military strength, the situation should; in my opinion, be so materially improved as to justify an ex-pectation of obtaining satisfactory terms of peace,(Signed)     D. IIAIG,F.M.    ...
