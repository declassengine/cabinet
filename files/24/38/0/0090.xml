MERCHANT   SHIPBUILDING.0oOAJ Kemcraniiim tc the War Cabinet from the First Lord .. cf the Admiralty.The Shipbuilding situation was reported upon fully by m^s elf as Controller cn the 5th July, 1917, and a further report was submitted by the present Controller cn the 19th November, 1917.In the former report a forecast was made of the probable loss cf British and Foreign tonnage on two alternative bases; and the forecast stated that so far as British tonnage was concerned we ought to leclg for an annual less cf from 4,700,000 tons to 5,700,000 tons. The actual figures to the end of the year have proved to. be 3,711,672 tons of British shipping, without making any allowance for 872,391 tons damaged vessels, but ex-perienoe has proved that very few of these ships are permanently lest.   The Foreign tonnage lest in the year amounted tc 2,429,445 tens, and damaged may amount tc something ever 500,000 tens, but no actual figures of these vessels are available.The estimate of building capacity for the second half cf 1917 submitted with the first report was 1,090;, 000 t on a f r cm U. K. Yar d s , given the necessary steel and labour.     The actual- output has amounted to 667,904 A.        tons, details month by month being given in Appendix HA&quot;. The difference between these two figures is accounted for by the completion cf certain vessels being deferred owing tc shortage of steel in the summer months of 1917, rml to the necessity for the conversion of a number cf Standard Ships tc Oilers, delaying their com-P let ion, and causing men and steel tc be diverted from new construction to this conversion.The income from Abroad was estimated at 326,000. tons for the six months to 31st December, 1917; but cnlj 116,797 tons have been actually delivered to us, while of vessels constructed to our order, 167,180 tens have been requisitioned and retained by the U.S. Government.The figures contained in the report of the 5th July, 1917j were a statement of productive capacity eiw tirely conditional on largely increased supplier of raw material and labour; and the Controller&apos;s memorandum of the 19th November, 1917, shows how the output cf steel had up to that time fallen far below the amount necessary to enable this estimate tc be realised.   The table attached tc that report gives details of the deliveries of steel week by week as ocrapared with the requirement.   This table is brought forward to the end cf the year and is given .. 3.      as Appendix &quot;B&quot;, from which it will be seen that the supply of steel has risen considerably.   With the expeption of certain special palates, steel is not at the moment the limiting factor.   The probable amount of steel available in 1918 for shipbuilding and repairs . C.^    is given in Appendix &quot;0&quot;, and if this is, realised, and if labour is forthcoming, it will enable the forecast given by the Ccirtroiler in October last to be realised.The limiting factor in the output of ships since October has been, and still is, labour.   T3ie8th January 1918,
following figures shew how the labour employed ill Ship-building Marine Engineering Works, and Repairs, is allocated between Warships and Merchant Vessels, and also between new work and repairs :-	NEW CONSTRUCTION,			REPAIRS.	grand	hulls.

This is exclusive of men required for Armament production.
According to the estimates, steel will become available during the year for the employment of the full number of men stated above;     and if steel and labour are both forthcoming timeously the estimate of TJS41/i$5Q gross tons for 1918 should be realised.     It must be re-membered, however, that while the acceleration was post--poned for three months In the summer by the shortage of steel,   a further lag has taken place by a failure to supply the labour required since the Shipbuildersr demand in October.VThe urgency of accelerating our output of Merchant ships is emphasised by Sir Thomas Royden1s re-port that the U.S. output of Merchant ships will prob-ably not exceed 2,000,000 gross tons in 1918 as^ against 6,000,000 asked for,   which it was estimated atA that time would be required from&apos; the U.S* to make good the World?s loss of tonnage up to December 1918*     The gross loss of World1s tonnage,   apart from damaged vessels, amounted in 1917 to over 6,000,000 gross tons.The Government have admitted fully that the necessity for more ships is the most urgent need of the moment.The steel and labour must,   therefore,   be sup-plied,   and in both these prime essentials the Admiralty Controller is dependent upon other Ministries,   nameiy? the Ministry of Munitions,   and the Ministry of National Service.This memorandum is put forward now,   at the com-mencement of the New Year,   so that the War Cabinet may have the results and failures of last year prominently before them,   and may,   if thoy see fit,   reiterate and con-firm to the Ministry of Munitions and the Linistry of National Service,   their clear view and wish that Ship-building is to be a first charge upon the resources of the State,   and that this first charge applies to material and men to the full extent of the Ship-productive capacity of the Country,   so that If at: all possible by the com-bined efforts of the Ministry of Munitions,   the Ministry of National Service, and the Admiralty Controller?   the forecast output Is to be exceeded.In this connection I would refer to the Heads of Agreement between the British Government and the American Government concerning the joint production of Tanks, dated 20th December, 1917,   Clause 7, of which provides for the provision of armoured plates by the British Government to be replaced in the form of Shiprs plates from America * Having regard to the extreme urgency of the Shipbuilder situation,   as disclosed In this memorandum,.   I wish to strongly urge that the exchange of steel shou3.d only be made on condition that the supply of steel for shipbuilding: Is In no way prejudiced or delayed.(Signed).
