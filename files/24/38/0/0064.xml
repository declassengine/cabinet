JM^^emorandum by the Secretary of State for War.267I have received the following covering letter and copy af^Jjfesolution passed at a Mass Meeting held at Sheerness on Sunday, December 23rd, 1917.19, Clyde Street, Sheerness.. 26th December, 1917...Sir,I have been requested to for?/ard the following copies of resolutions which were all carried unanimously at a public mass meeting held on Sunday December.23rd, 1917.I would most respectfully request that a reply be given as early as possible in order to allay the strong feeling of resentment existing amongst the inhabitants.Resolutions 1 to 4 are as appointed to organise the meeting, from the body of the hall.submitted by the committeeThe other being as submittedI am,Sir.Your most obedient Servant, (Sgd.) P.JcTamlyn,-Hon.Secretary.(Copy of enclosure),1.     That this mass meeting of the inhabitants of Sheerness district organized by the&quot;trade union movement, protest against the continued refusal of the Military Authorities to provide suitable bombproof shelter and a greater measure of protection against enemy action; also against the complete absence of warning at night of the approach of hostile aircraft and considers that any further.delay in. dealing with-these natters would be an outrage upon the inhabitants and may prove disastrous.  -This meeting also considers that, as almost theentire population of Sheerness and district are compelled to remain in the danger zone either on account of their employment under the Government, or to administer to the needs of Government employees, compensation should be paid to the dependents - in&quot; the event of the breadwinner losing his or her life or being incapacitated through enemy action.3.     This meeting also considers that, on production of reliable medical evidence of the health of any dependents of a worker being effected by air raids, which necessitates their removal from this&apos; area, a subsistence allowance should be granted to the worker in order that he or she may be enabled to meet his or her liabilities in connection with keeping two homes.    &apos; This grant to be at least equal to that paid to national Service Volunteers.     It is also considered that freerailway
railway warrants should he. issued in all such cases.      It is further considered that private- employers&apos; should be subsidised&apos; by the fit ate&quot; in order that all-workers in the district may be treated alike.4.     That those resolutions be sent to the Prime llinister, first Lord ojf the Admiralty and the Secretary- of State for &apos; far.That we should request a favourable reply within fourteen days, faillewhich a further mass Lieetinf.; be called to consider definite action,On the 2nd November, 1917, the followin-f answer was sent to the Secretary of the Sent Education Committee in reply to a somewhat similar request.- -79/49 (3?.v/. 3.ai) *  &apos; 2nd November, 1917.Sir,   -In reply to your letters - dated October 11th and October 26th, 1917, I am commanded by the Army Council to say that the -provision of cover for the civil pbpulat ion-a rainst bombs is not a matter for the Army Council, or one upon &quot;which this Department is authorised to expend public money.2.     The local military authorities would be  lad to give at any time, such assistance as is possible by providing euch . technical advice or military labour as nay be available on the . spot, in connection with the construction of any shelters or bomb proofs which may be taken in hand - -.provided that no- charge is thereby imposed upon Army funds*I am,&apos; ,f -- Sir, &apos;   -Your obedient Servant, .. (S d.J P.p^ Qubitt.        &apos; -The - Secretary,: Kent Education Committee..   &apos;- - On 2?th September, .1917, in Home. Office letter 271G86/613 addressed to General Headquarters, Home forces,.Sir George Cave declined&apos;to accept the suggestion &quot;that any responsibility for providing protection of this kind rests with the Hone Office&quot;.Thus the position at the present time is that., neither the Home Office-nor the War Office is prepared to accept this .. responsibility and that, while the latter Department, is -willing&apos; to &quot;render such assistance as is outlined in the letter of 2nd November.,. 191.7,, &apos; quoted -above, it has no power to allot funds for this purposetWith regard to the policy i-n-volvdd my views are as follows       ..
I do not a-dT4-.se :^tlie construction&quot;&apos; of shelters for the civil population not enlaced -on actual-munition work,(a) because in the case of&apos;bomb-proof shelters the difficulty of providing; labour and material is prohibitive;(b) because in the case of merely splihter-proof shelters the ordinary dwelling house gives almost equal protectidn.; while labour and material would still constitute a great difficulty,(c) because, in the case of (a) or (b) the labour- would necessarily be. employed at the expense of work of greater urgency; . ...    .(d) and finally for the reasons stated in the first paragraph of the Report. of the Committee appointed by the War Cabinet Cabinet Up-.245 Min. 13)&apos; to consider the question of providing cover in London against Air-raids (G.T.2285) vizThat it is undesirable to encourage people to leave &apos;.-   their houses in order to take shelter elsewhere.   &apos; A house however lightly- built forms a&apos; good protection against splinters;   and the risk of lives being- lost by enemy bombs is less if the population.are scattered in their own homes than if they are&quot; collected together in shelters which cannot be made&quot;bomb-proof.     Further, if families leave their houses durin-: the raid in order to seek better- shelter elsewhere., they run a serious&apos;risk of being hit in the ,.streets by bombs or splinters from our own r;un s,LEBBY.8th January, 1918,
