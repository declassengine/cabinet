(Tfeifc Document is the Prop4  v of67SEC RET.Copy No:  1779/9707.3.1.18.1.This question was last considered in detail byTrooos required for Home Defence.the War Cabinet in March 1917, and no&apos;material change was then made in the probable scale of attack vrtrich formed the basis upon which Home Defence requirements were estimated. The accepted assumption was that, under certain conditions, it was possible for the enemy to attempt an invasion of this country with a force of 160,000 men of all arms.2.     To meet-this attempt, to find garrisons for defended ports, to protect &quot;vulnerable points&quot; (i.e. munition factories, etc.), to preserve order in Ireland, and to provide anti-aircraft defence, the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces estimated that he required roughly 500,000 men.    Included in this force were 10 divisions.    This number was reduced early last year, by the instructions of the V/ar Cabinet, to 8 divisions, and other reductions have since been made with the result that the establishment - that is the authorised strength - now stands at 400,979 as against the original 500,000, - see Appendix A,   It will be observed that the present actual strength is some 10,000 above the authorised strength. This is due to a variety of unavoidable causes common to all military organizations.     Attention is drawn to the figure 400,979 because a widespread idea prevails that a much greater number of men is retained for Home Defence, as there are some 1,420,000 men in all at home.   But more than 1,000,000 of these form no part of the Home Defence Forces, and a statement accounting for them has already been supplied to the War Cabinet Committee on Man-Power.
3.   An analysis of the number 400,979 is given In Appendix A where it will be seen that the establishment of the &quot;Mobile Troops&quot; is only 190,045.-   Further, of this number some 16,000 are employed in the preservation of order in Ireland;,   about 50,000 are lads under 19 years of age, while the greater part of the whole belong to categories lower than A.i.     Referring to the same Appendix, it is not possible to make any material reduction in the &quot;Coast Defence&quot; establishment of 161,130 men, for of this number 128,000 infantry belong to draft finding units which, if not at the ports, would have to be located elsewhere, while the remainder are also largely draft finding units and are required to man the guns etc. and to perform certain permanent garrison duties.     Similarly as regards &quot;Anti-aircraft Defence&quot; and &quot;Protection&quot; no great reductions can be made,.     The only possible reductions in these three classes are in the R.D.C. Protection battalions and companies, and these are gradually being effected as far as possible.4,   The main question for consideration therefore is to what extent reductions can be made in the &quot;Mobile Troops&quot; (190,045 men), and with this object in view the situation has again been reviewed by representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and Home Defence Forces.     The Conclusions of the Conference are given in Appendix B, and in so far as they are of a military nature they have been approved by the Army Council. The Board of Admiralty are unable to concur entirely in the naval portion - see Appendix C.       The important point for the War Cabinet to notice is that the Conference, of which the present Chief of Naval Staff was a member, came to the conclusion that the difficulties of transporting a hostile force of 160,000 men to our shores are so great as to be practically insuperable,
and that the maximum force with which our land forces may. have to deal is limited to that which can he carried in one convoy, that is 30,000 men with a strictly limited proportion of transport and artillery.     The Board of Admiralty, on the other hand, decline to give an absolute guarantee that the enemy could not transport a force of 160,000 men, but are of opinion that it is reasonably probable he could not bring over more than 70,000 men.The matter Is now submitted for the consideration and decision of the War Cabinet.5. Whether 70,000 or 30,000 men can be transported is a naval not a military question, and so long as the Admiralty adheres to the opinion that 70,000 can be transport-ed the War Office has no alternative but to provide a defence force strong enough to deal with that number.     The views of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces as to the troops needed to deal with the 70,000, as against the previous figure of 160,000, are given in his letter annexed -Appendix D,   It will there be seen that, in order to afford reasonable security, the only reduction he considers should be made is three divisions, thus leaving five as against the existing eight.   He further requests it should be accepted that all Home Service units must be kept up to their establish-ment, that the number of Lewis guns should be increased as far as possible, and that units should not be drawn upon for agricultural or other labour.   He adds that &quot;although risk will still remain, it may be considered that in the circumstances of the case it is one which may be accepted by the War Cabinet&quot;,   The effect of reducing the three divisions would be to set free about 38,000 men, thus leaving a mobile force of about 152,000 men as compared with the present 190,045,
6.     The General Staff had hoped that, as a result of the reduced scale of probable attack, and as the Admiralty now expect to give previous &quot;warning of attempted invasion, whereas under the old scheme it was assumed the first intimation we might have would be the arrival of the hostile transport off our shores, it would have been possible to reduce four divisions, thus effecting a saving of about 50,000 men, and leaving a force of about 140,000.     Even this may seem unduly large to deal with an attacking force of 70,000, but it must be remembered that a considerable number will be required for the preservation of order in Ireland, and that we have to watch a&apos; great length of coast-line on which considerable detachments of troops must always be kept in readiness, It may be added that little or no economy Y/ould accrue from breaking up more than four divisions as practically the whole of the infantry in the remaining four would, under the new arrangement, consist of lads under 19 years of age, who are not available for service abroad.7.       If the 30,000 scale were adopted the Field-Marshal agrees it might be justifiable to accept the risk of reducing four divisions, and it is possible some reductions could be made in formations other than the divisions amounting to about 20,000 men, or a total saving of 70,000, and leaving 120,000 men.It should be understood that the bulk of the men set free, no matter what reduction may be made, will be men of categories below A.i.8.       The chief points to which I desire to draw the attention of the War Cabinet are :-
(Sd.) W.R.Robertson0.1 * Q . S ,.3rd January 1918(a) Should the naval situation become less favourable to us in the future and the scale of attach be thereby increased we shall not of course be able to raise new units all at once.     It will take many months,, even if the personnel are available, to raise them.(b) If it should later be decided (I hope it will not) to send to the front lads under the age of 19 the greater part of the infantry of the divisions retained will disappear, in which case we could not deal with an attack even of 30,000 men.9,   These are the risks incurred in breaking up the existing divisions.     There are however a number of men in draft-finding units, varying from time to time in numbers and efficiency, who can be made available to reinforce the Home Defence Force proper in the course of a few days.     In addition to them are the Volunteers, present strength 238,000, who can also be used as reinforcements although they can never be regarded as Immediately available to deal with invasion.

The Conference examined the conclusions arrived at on previous occasions, and, in the light of the most recent information and of practical experience gained in the handling of large convoys, proceeded to consider the following questionsWhat is the largest force which the combined Staffs estimate that the enemy may reasonably be expected to : -(a) Transport to our shores;(b) Succeed in landing.(A) The Military representatives stated that it was still possible for the.enemy to find a force of 160,000 menfor
for the invasion of these islands, and that it was still a fact that on open beaches it was possible to land that number with a strictly limited amount of transport   and artillery, within 32-36 hours (iae. the time within which the Admiralty could not guarantee effective interruption as stated at the Conference of 16th March, 1917), provided the weather was favourable and the landing unopposed.On the military side the only new factors in the situation were the continued improvement in the arrangements for the defence of possible landing places and the expansion of the Air Services in the United Kingdom.(B)       The--naval representatives stated that the following new factors had arisen :-(I) The entry of America into the war had affected the situation in our favour by increasing our resources in both heavy and light shipss and in the out-put of mines,(Ii)   The extension of submarine patrols had increased our chances of obtaining warning, (iii)   The extension of British mine-fields in theHeligoland Bight had added to the difficulties of assembling and moving large convoys without previous mine-sweeping, which could hardly pass unobserved.(C )       The naval and military representatives were equally of opinion that the great development of our air resources had radically affected the situation in our favour in as much as (i)   Facilities for oversea reconnaissance had been improved.(ii) We were assured of overwhelming superiority over any air forces which could be maintained by the enemy on our coasts.(ill)
fill) The offensive power of our air forces againsttransports and troops attempting to disembark had greatly increasedo2,        The Conference submitted to a Sub-committee oomposod of members of the Admiralty War Staff and General Staff the detailed consideration of the following questions(i)     She largest number of ships that are likely to sail in one convoy from the German ports, taking into oonsideration(a) Sea organisation:(b) The facilities as far as known for embarking and despatching troops:(o) The navigational difficulties on the way across.(ii)     Taking into consideration the ships which are known to be in the various German harbours available for transports, the number of mon that these ships are likely to carry over the short distance.(iii) The various beaches on the east coast which are likely to be used by the enemy for disembarking troops, for the purpose of an invasion in force, taking into consideration :-(a) Landing facilities from tide etc:(b) Navigational difficulties of approach:(c) The chances of their being interrupted or attacked by ITaval action other than the Grand Fleet.(iv) Whether two or more beaches and an equal number of convoys can be used simultaneously*The report of the Sub-committee is attached (Appendix &quot;A;r) and tho Conference concurred in the opinions expressed therein03o Conclusionso3.-
4- 783*        Conclusions.   The Conference -eame to the following conclusions :-(i)   In view of the amount of preparation required, the size of the convoy and the length of the sea voyage, warning of an attempted invasion would be obtained, thus enabling the necessary naval dispositions to be taken,(ii)   The difficulties of assembling and moving the&apos; number of ships required to transport 160,000 men within the time which would be at the enemy rs disposal are&apos; so great as to be practically insuperable, (iii)   Although an absolute guarantee cannot be givenagainst the arrival of one convoy - maximum size 32 ships - the Conference consider that it is impossible for subsequent convoys to reach our shores without such action on our part as would ensure the complete failure of the expedition,^iv)   The maximum force with which the land forces mayhave to deal is therefore limited to that which can be carried in one such convoy. i.e., 30,000 men, with a strictly limited proportion of transport and artillery,(v)   The Conference adhered to the conclusions arrived at at the Conference of January^ 1916, (part IV, para 15) - viz (a) The coast north of Cromarty (exclusive), the whole of the West coast (Including Ireland), and the South coast from Landfs End to Selsey Bill (exclusive) should be considered as exposed to the attack of not more than two cruisers or armed merchantmen -capable of landing 500 to 600 men without artillery, as no greater force could get round to the-West Coast without being detected,In

Kirke, Col: G.S.In determining the strength of the garrisons of any naval bases on these stretches of coast, the value of the objective to the Navy should, however, also be taken Into oonsIderatlon. (b)   It would be advisable to assume.that the coast from north of the Wash to Cromarty (inclusive) is exposed to the attack of a raiding force of 20,000 men with light artillery, and a few howitzersj but its re-embarkation would be exceedingly improbable0     In determining the strength of the garrisons provided at any of the ports on this stretch of the coast, the size of the foroe which the enemy would be willing to sacrifice in return for the destruction of the objective should be taken Into account. At the same time the Conference were of opinion that in view of the notice which we should obtain and of the consequent dispositions of our naval forces, the risk to the enemy would increase as the point of attempted landing is further north of the &quot;Wash,(vi)   The experience at Gallipoli when the naval conditions were exceptionally favourable has shown the very limited effect of naval gunfire upon entrenchments and demonstrated the impossibility of effecting a landing on an 9Pen beach, which is adequately protected with barbed wire and covered by firs from the land from well sited and suitably arranged entrenchments.

1, ^*Ll^l^^J^Der of shiPs that       likely tosail in one convoy from the German ports, taking into consideration ,-*(a) Sea organisation,(b) The facilities as far as known for embarking and despatching troops,(c) The navigational difficulties on the way across,is considered to be 32.The above is baBed on practical experience of convoy work gained during the war.The facilities for the embarkation and despatch of troops in the German port are &quot;believed to be such that no limit will be imposed on the size of the expedition on this account.2. The number of such convoys which could bemoved.Vessels available and facilities for,embarkation^etc *According to I,D. 1141 (2) of October., 1917, the following steam vessels were in German ports on 10th October, 1917.Vessels of 9 knots and above - 160, aggregating 800,000 tons,The above numbor is exclusive of (a) Three vessels of 40,000, 52,000 and 60,000
tons gross respectively, which are considered as too large for expeditionary purposes on a hostile coast *&apos;(bj    Three vessels of Gj- knots speed - aggregating 6,000 tons.(c)     Many vessels below 1,000 tons gross..It is considered the 160 ships totalling 800.000 tons gross, together with a certain number of ships below 1000 tens, could transport a force of 160,000 men, with a strictly limited supply of artillery, ammunition and transportsThis would necessitate the sailing of 5 convoys of 32 ships each,,Prom our experience of convoy ?/ork during the war, this is considered to be possible but extremely difficultj and unless the ships had been previously practised, a certain amount of confusion, with consequent accidents, would result.The chief and very serious difficulty, Tromthe enemy&apos;s point of view, would be the forming up of the convoysAn officer who has had experience of convoy work during the war has no hesitation in saying that to form a convoy up at night is quite impossible.In forming up the convoys, the enemy would have two main difficulties to contend with(a)   The fact that he will have to form up in the British notified mine area.   This will necessitate a very wide passage being swept through that area,
3,(b)     The time at which the convoys must be formed nap, consequent on the length of the voyage, the speed of the transport, and the desirability of arriving off our coast at daylight.Taking into consideration the vessels available andthe fact that the speed of the convoy must be at least oneknot less than the speed of the slowest ships, it is notconsidered that the expedition could proceed at a greaterspeed than 9 knots.     Thus the convoys can cover &quot;at aPmaximum, 216 miles in 24 hours.Therefore, in order to arrive off our coast by daylight, the leading convoy must be formed up by daylight the previous day, ready to weigh and proceed, at a rendezvous not more than 216 miles from the intended place of landing, the other convoys being similarly formed up in rear of it.Thus, since they cannot form up in the dark, it will be necessary for them to leave the ports of embarkation during daylight of the- day previous to that (i,e. two days before the intended landing), and anchor for the night in their cruising formation at the rendezvous as above.In the case of a landing near Yarmouth (the nearest point to the ports of embarkation), the above rendezvous would be in the outer part of the Heligoland Bight, off the German coast.P     If lighters are towed, the speed of the convoy would be reduced.
But in the case of a landing at, say, Deal, the enemy must either anchor for one. night in cruising formation off the Dutoh Island of Ameland, or spend that night at sea, either alternative adding to the risk of discovery.The above calculations refer to the leading convoy of the main force, and assume that the cruising formation of eaoh convoy is four columns in line abreast at 6 oablesT interval, eaoh column consisting of eight ships at 3 cables1 interval.   Experience has proved that this is the most suitable formation without oovering too large a front.It is reasonable to assume that, with 5 convoys each proceeding in the above formation, the rear convoy could not be anchored until 6 to 9 hours after daylight, assuming that the covering force has anchored before daylight.   In fact, at least 2 hours should elapse between the anohoring of the covering force and that of the main body. .It has been suggested that the enemy might run his transports ashore at high water and disembark the men with the falling tide.   Owing to the necessary interval between the arrival of the leading and rear convoys (at least six hours), it would only be possible for somo of the convoys to anohor at high water.
The invasion of the industrial districts of the Midlands and North of England would he a serious matter, and might have a disastrous effect; hut it is improbable that this would force the United Kingdom to make peace.Military considerations affecting invasion of England on a large scale *Unless absolutely successful, invasion would involve the loss of all the troops engaged.        Such an operation would therefore only be undertaken if it offered a reasonable certainty of ending the war.        This end could probably be obtained by the capture and retention of London.      Taking into -consideration the small amount of artillery and transport which could be landed with this force in the time available, sufficient troops might be con-centrated from France to protect London within a -week if the Cross-Channel service is not interrupted, provided a suitable reserve is available in France at the time.        It took the Austrians 16 days to cover an average of 65 miles in their pursuit of the routed Italians.        An advance on London would be opposed from the start; and we shall be on the safe side In stating that to reach London within the time available the enemy force must land within 75 miles.It is possible that the enemy might, as part of their scheme, endeavour to interrupt the Cross-Channel service.Such interruption might be maintained for 36 hours but with the arrival of the Grand Fleet in Southern Haters, any interruption should be overcome.This temporary interruption would not materially delay the transfer of the troops to England, as this time would^4)e--o^^cupiJecU^^ them-at-tne ports ofembarkation.
4.        ConsJ.de rat ion of the various beaches within a radius of 75 mjles of London which might be used by the enemy for disembarking troops .Beaches to the west of the Straits of Dover.See Chart 1431 attached.   Not considered practicable from a naval point of view as the expedition would have to be well down into the. Narrow Seas during daylight of the previous day which would result in early warning being received.       The danger of mines and torpedo attack whilst passing through the Straits of Dover at night is prohibitive.Details of the Beaches on the South East and East Coasts within 75 miles of London are given in Tables A and B and on Chart 2182 A attached.From these tables it will be seen that for military reasons, only 45 miles are in anyWay suitable for a landing which aims at deoisive results.      Naval considerations reduce this 45 miles to a total of 10 miles (Aldeburgh to Southwold). All experience showsthat Yfithout aeroplane spotting, it is not possible for ships&apos; guns to knock out shore defences.        Cur superiority in aircraft would deprive the enemy of observation. The vulnerable portions of the coastare strongly defended with barbed wire and machine-guns with mobile troops close at hand in reserve . Thesearrangements ensure that landings would be strongly opposed, and that nothing approaching a force of 160,000 men could be landed within 24 hours, quite
apart from naval interruption.Naval interruption- other than that of the Grand Fleet.The Naval interruption which may he expected on the Aldehurgh - Southwold Stretch of Coast Is shown on Chart 1094,     And on the most unfavourable conditions for ourselves, e,g., when no warning is received, may be summarised as  :Covering Force Convoy 0 . B Possibly no interrupt ion,Main Force Convoys.Leading convoys could be attacked by submarines from Yarmouth and Harwich though loss from enemy&apos;s mines must be accepted.The rear portion of the expedition could be attacked by Light Cruisers and Destroyers before they had anchored,.The Escort of the expedition would offer an obstacle to such an attack but considering the length of the expedition and the comparatively slow speed of the heavy ships it should be possible for our light forces to evade them sufficiently to make an attack on some part of the expedition,,Bombing attacks by Naval Aircraft will depend on the amount of reconnaissance which is considered necessary..In a case such as that which is being considered
p0the situation should almost immediately be obvious and the naval aircraft should be able to commence bombing long before the rear convoys had anchored (See Table C).6,   The question whether two or more beaches and an equal number of convoys can be used simultaneously.There does not appear to be any objection to this from a naval point of view, except that additional mine sweeping will be required and the escort would be scattered.The beaches would however have to be sufficiently far apart to obviate the convoys approaching one another in the dark,&apos;The minimum distanoe for this is considered to be 10 miles which is the maximum distanoe from the military point of view,7.   Feints.It would not pay the enemy to make feint landings before the main operations, as this would only result in the Grand Fleet intervening sooner.
ST.In conclusion it may be stated:-fa) The preparations necessary for an invasionof this country will necessitate :(1)   The use of the whole of the German naval forces including those in the Baltic,(2)    The withdrawal from other duties of a very large number of mercantile ratings for manning the transports,       (Additional ratings must be carried for manning the boats.)(3) Considerable preparation of ships to be used as transports, such as fitting with davits--and. extra boats,\U_of.which- operations are likely to become known to us.It is also probable- that.all -suhmar-lnes would be concentrated in the North Sea or Channel in an at-tempt to hold off the Grand Fleet, and cut the communi^--cations to France,,The withdrawal of all submar-inoa iVoTrrCommer^ie Destruction should put us on the alsrt.(&apos;b) The embarkation of the troops offers no^ar-td^nilar difficulty to the enemy.(c)        But on the other hand the putting to sea of the expedition offers very grea-t^jdiffdculties on account of:-f
(1)      The distance to the English Coast being such that to arrive at daylight on Monday, say, the expedition must leave a position within 216 miles of our coast at daylight on Sunday,(2)      Thus the transports must clear the German ports on Saturday during daylight, and(3)      Remain at anchor in the Heligoland Bight during Saturday night, or spend that night at sea.(4)       In both of which cases the German Fleet must take up a covering position and large areas must be swept for mines.(5)      All of vrtiich operations risk discovery.(d) The passage of an expedition of approximately160 ships in 5 separate convoys is an operation the difficulties of which must not be minimised when the necessity for secrecy and the following facts are taken into consideration :(1)      The merchant ships now in German harbours would be unaccustomed to working together unless previous practice had been obtained or the ships were officered and partly manned by naval ratings.(2)      The difficulty of providing the necessary naval officers and ratings, as all their Naval Force will be required as escort.(3)      The difficulty of exercising the ships citherIn the inner waters of the Heligoland   Bight or
the Baltic without information leaking out.(4)     The large area covered by the expedition and the volume of smoke from so many merchant ships might lead to detection.(5)     Which would be accentuated by the presence of the High Sea Fleet acting as protection.(6)     The slow speed of the expedition would make it necessary for the leading convoy to be within air reconnaissance distance of our shores during the late afternoon of the day previous to the landing.     (Weather which is suitable for landing is also suitable for flying).C7)     The possibility of mines would necessitate sweeping ahead of the convoy9(e) The anchoring of the expedition is an operationof great magnitude., extending over several hours, and which is liable to be thrown into confusion if the sweeping vessels discover mines,Also cross-currents, the extinction of shore lights and the presence of shoals make the coast a difficult one to approach In the dark,(f) .The opposition from our Naval Forces would no doubt be discounted as far as possible by providing a strong escort, but when the large area covered by the expedition Is taken into account it is clear that

PiSECRET. Apperjdjx ,c, Copy No,   Vi79/9707.Covering Letter to Secretary, War Cabinet, from Board of Admiralty and Imperial General Staff.1.    The Board of Admiralty and Imperial General Staff have carefully considered the report of the joint Naval and Military Conference on the question of Invasion2.    The Board of Admiralty are unable to ooncur entirely in the naval portion of the report, since they are of opinion that it is difficult to Indicate with any precision the number of transports that the enemy might be able to bring over in one operation.    They are therefore unable to give an absolute guarantee that the enemy oould not transport a force of 160,000 men to these shores, but they are of opinion that It is reasonably probable, that the maximum number of transports which the enemy could succeed in bringing over would not be more than could transport a force of 70,000 men.3*    The Imperial General Staff concur in the military portion of the report.    They are unable to express any opinion as to, paragraph 6 above, as the question is purely navale4.    The Board of Admiralty and the Imperial General Staff are Impressed by the fact that invasion implies delicate and detailed preparation and Is a very difficult operation to carry through successfully.     In view of the Improvements that have recently taken place in our air services, in the development of mining in the North Sea and the continued strengthening of the defences of possible landing places, coupled with the fact that the Intelligence Services maybe
be expected to give some notice of the enemy rs preparation, they are of opinion that though the Admiralty are unable to give an absolute guarantee that a force of 160,000 men cannot be transported to&apos; these shores, still the risk of invasion by a force of 160,000 men, taking the naval and military difficulties of such an operation together into consideration, is so small as to justify them in advising the War Cabinet to accept it,5.     The Board of Admiralty and the Imperial General Staff, however, recognise that a raid, as distinct from invasion, is a danger which must be guarded against, and the Board of Admiralty are of opinion that this will entail certain slight modifications in naval dispositions.6,     The Board of Admiralty and the Imperial General Staff are also of opinion -that, in&quot; &quot;view &quot;oT&quot;the-experience of landing operations gained during the war;    of the Admiralty statement that an attempted landing between the Wash and the Straits of Dover can be effectiveJ.y interrupted by naval action within 32 to 36 hours;    and of the fact that we may expect.,to receive warning before a landing is attempted;    a landing by a force of 70,000 men with such a limited time at its disposal before interference takes plane should be defeated, provided that the possible landing places are suitably entrenched and held by sufficient military forces to oppose the landing until naval intervention can take effect,(signed) R.E.Wemyss.31.12.17.(signed) W,R.Robertson.2.1.18.
Appendix fi01GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,96HOI-IE&quot;J FORCES,S E. C R E THORSE GUARDS,LONDON, S1..F.CR, 352 (0)3rd January 1918.C.I.G.S.Far Office.In reply to your letter No. 79/9707 (D.M.O.) of 2nd instant, I offer the following remarks, assuming that It is possible to land 70,000 men south of the Wash, and that the Admiralty opinion that thecoast line south of Orfordness is more or less unsuitable for landing operations is.accepted.1.   The possibility of effective defence depends upon:-(a) The efficiency of the coast entrenchments making it impossible to land an enemy detachment,(b) If the coast defence should be forced, the provision of sufficient troops, especially howitzers and heavy artillery, capable of rapid concentration at the danger point, so asto drive the enemy force and any support back to the sea.2,   It is necessary to keep in the Scottish and Northern Commands the mobile troops now stationed there, and it is also necessary, although Invasion is held to be unlikely, to keep some force south of the Thames.If the proposed Garrison of Ireland and the troops referred to above are deducted, and the mobile divisions are reduced to four, the force available in East Anglia will consist:-with some Cyclist Battalions and six Heavy Batteries.3.    The coast south of Harwich is to some extent vulnerable and requires one (Coast Watching) Mixed Brigade with one Division (Colchester) in support, and there therefore remain :-Three Divisions.Three Cyclist Brigades.Four Mixed Brigades,Two Infantry Divisions,Three Mixed Brigades.Three Cyclist Brigades (six Regiments each).for
Q7necessaryfor the defence of the country from Ipswich to the Wash.The approximate establishment of these formations is 53,000 men; that Is to say, considerably less in actual numbers than the numbers which, according to the Admiralty estimate, could be brought against them.4.     It is to be remembered also that the Infantry Divisions are composed of very young and only partially trained soldiers, and the Mixed Brigades contain a considerable proportion of men who are not fit for prolonged physical exertion.Further, that the long line of vulnerable coast from Orfordness to the &quot;vfash, which must in any case be held, makes it impossible at the moment to move the Mixed Brigades from their positions to reinforce any other part of the coast line,5,     The immediate resistance will therefore be that of the Mixed Brigade on the spot.     Any one Brigade can be reinforced within a few hours by the Cyclist Brigade in its immediate vicinity, and at intervals, which vary according to the position of attack, by one or possibly two more Cyclist Brigades and eventually by two Infantry Divisions,But the total strength of these troops will not reach two-thirds of the enemy&apos;s total force,6.     In view of the above considerations, although if the possible enemy force is reduced to 30,000 men, it may be justi-fiable to accept the risk of reduction to four Divisions of the eight Home Service - Divisions now allotted to Home Defence, such a reduction will naturally involve much greater risk if the possible invading force is increased to 70,000 picked troops.7.     In such circumstances,at least one additional Division, in addition to the existing Cyclist Battalions, would appear to be
necessary for reasonable security, making&apos; five Home Service Divisions in all; and it should be accepted that the Mixed and . Cyclist Brigades and Units must be kept up to their establishments; that the Lewis Guns should be increased as far as possible; and that the Units are not drawn upon for agricultural or other labour.Although risk will still remain, it may be considered that in the circumstances of the case it is one which may be accepted by the tfar Cabinet.(signed)   French.Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces,
