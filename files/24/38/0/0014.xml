&apos; 106. -.....:J;Jt^:::.::i5.TJ;.V:L;&apos;*&apos; he Property off J% Intelligence Bureau .fh.jr    v . Us I ,0^*4  &apos;    - department on Information^    ;       1/ 82, Victoria Street. PK7/0S0Weekly Keport on France * XX, (Sra January, 1918)The political interest of the last fortnight la France centres round two speeches, that of Mo Gaillaux in his own defence, and that of M. Piohon on Foreign Policy and the ^ar -ims of the Allies..(There can be no doubt that Caillaux had a certain success. Experience shows that any member of any Parliament defending him-self against a personal attack oan count on receiving from his fellow members an amount of sympathy whioh often astonishes out-siders.    But in this case it is not easy to say what the saoeess       !J really amounted to&apos;. . H. Caillaux did not himself oppose the sus-pension of his immunity and, though the Socialists declared they would here opposed it hut for hiB own attitude, the result was a Ipractically unanimous division, only two JJeputies voting against suspension.    There were however 116 abstentions, among whom were seventy-six Socialists and twenty-six Radical Socialists,    (The leader Of the socialists, M. ftenaudel, made a bitter attack on II. Clemenoeau end tried hard to force him into replying to Caillaux. But he wisely refused to fall into the trap and briefly declined to re-oly on the ground that as head of the hierarchy of military Justice he had no right to debate an issue whioh, if the Chamber jsuspended Caillaux1s immunity, would come before a Court of Justice, j the only tribunal fit to decide it.    No doubt this was not only Ithe most correct but also the safest course.    If he had replied he would have run the risk of either failing to do so with effect, or else of revealing more of the case against Caillaux than it is prudent to reveal before the trial.    As it was he left Caillaux in possession of a field which was not disputed - whioh is not the1 itBrass
i iskind of victory parliamentarians prefer.There is no need to give a detailed analysis of Caillaua^s speech here.    Nobody oan tell what it is worth till it is subjected to cross-examination and confronted by the full case of the proseeu-tion.    All that one oan say at the moment is that when a man has to explain away his acquaintance with a whole series of dubious characters who are universally believed to be traitors, he is ex-posed to awkward Questions, not easy to be answered, as to how there came to he so many of them.    And if he was not the friend of Germany and the enemy of England to whom he now pays a pretty tribute, how did he come to allow that belief to be so universal as it was among hie friends as well as his foes?    However, Ill-judged political opinion and unsavoury friendships are not treason:   and the question of his actual guilt cannot now be discussed till his trial begins.A more immediate question 4s the political atmosphere created by the charge against him.    Most of his speech was a statement of what purported to he facts and arguments, during which on the whole he avoided attempts to raise passion.    But the Socialists and Ex-treme Left who have all along regarded his prosecution with suspicion and hostility, interrupted his speech with applause while the Centre and Right sat silent.     &apos;nd he himself devoted the whole of the last part of his speech to an appeal to the left and to an attempt to turn the issue into a party one between left and Right,    He openly at-tacked the &quot;union bacree&quot; as having placed the country in the hands of the forces of reaction, declared that the iTenoh had never been successful except under the Revolutionary flag, and esserted, amid loud Socialist applause, that it was right and not wrong, as M, Clemenoeau had said, to consider peace in the midst of war, and to take thought of the losses the war had caused and was still causing,   J
He then played his strongest and most dangerous card:   &quot;You are making a new Dreyfus affails at my expense.   You have been laying traps for me for four years!   I am to be got rid of because of the work T have done in the past, the work you fear I may do in the fu-ture.There is the great danger.     ..111 he succeed in playing the role of a martyr, of a new Dreyfus, victim, like the other, of the hatred of the Church and the General Staff.?   Uill he succeed in splitting France in,two and destroying Clemenoeau?The answer will of course depend ohiefly on what happens at the trial.     But that will not begin for some weeks, during which the political atmosphere may change for better or for worse.     ill that one oan say at this moment is that there is no great appearance of any strong movement of a dangerous character.     One politician, not a follower of Caillaux, is reported to say &quot;Caillaux will win alive or dead.     If he goes to the S^watai he will be acquitted. If he is shot by order ox a Court Martial there will be a violent reaction.&quot;   Of course that is the risk Clernenceau decided to run, and none oan estimate it better thsn an old Dreyfusard like himself. The nervous politician may well be overestimating, as politicians are apt to do, the interest taken by the public in political leaders. It was a wave of impatience and distrust of politicians that brought Clemenoeau into power and he mpy well be right in believing that his courage in belling the biggest of all the political cats will double his strengHfr in the country at large.It seems probable that the trial will be before the Senate, not before a Court Martial.     This will be decided at the preliminary 1 instruction1, as the French call it.     Unless this leads to the charge being confined, as in the case of Bolo, to that of intelli-gence with the enemy, Caillaux will go before the High Court, i.e. -
the Senate, as the Italian charge is regarded as political.    There seems to be some danger of anti-Snglish and anti-Italian feeling being worked up in the matter, as many Irenchmen think that Clemenceau has been pushed into the prosecution by the British and Italian Governments.    Indeed there is said to be a kind of wave of feeling at the present moment against the English and American &apos;&apos;invasion&quot;. But one would hardly suppose this could be very dangerous as it so obviously invites the reply &quot;Bo you wish us to go away?&quot;The ether speech, which is the second event of the fortnight, calls for less comment. . Ex-Ministers in Prance rarely speak, and t the Chamber had not heard Y. ?iohon for several years.    His speech had an immense success both in the chamber and outside.    Even those papers which like the Sooialist Humanite criticize his words or policy, admit that their critioisms are a discord in the general &quot;chorus of praise&quot;.     So in the Chamber the only opposition, and that not at all violent, came from the Socialists who proposed an Order of the Day of their own, demanding a revision of war-aims and publication of secret treaties, but on its defeat by 278 to 103 allowed the Vote of Confidence to pass unanimously, though they did not actually vote in its favour.hat dia M. 2ichon say?    A great deal of course that is &quot;common form&quot; on these occasions.    But the notable things were his clear opening statement that no &quot;llied Government could possibly accept official relations with the present rulers of Russia who had entered upon peace negotiations in defiance of their treaty obligations without consulting us, published treaties without our consent, re-pudiated Russians financial obligations and instructed their represent-atives to oppose all existing governments.    At the same time he laid stress on the necessity of maintaining relations with the saner elements of Russia,     Thiss^ necessity and duty was redoubled, he said,
C( O. - 5 -by the relations of Prance with Roumania, whose interventioh in thewar was so largely due to French influence.     He then spoke of thewar-aims of the Allies, insisting that none of the Allies entertaineddesigns of conquest, but -tfrey are fighting f%r certain principleswhich they hope to establish and place under the guarantee of acommon organisation, the Society of Nations.     Of these principlesthe restoration of Alsace-Lorraine was, he declared, a symbol.   Thatquestion was a world-question, not a merely Frenoh question, bethbecause it was a moral issue and because without its settlement theworld could never have a durable peace.     He defended with grea$vigour, in spite of Socialist cries of &apos;Asie Mineure&apos; the treatywhich brought Italy into the war.     He denied that there had everbeen any desire to exterminate the German people.     He declared thatPoland must be one, free and indivisible.    And finally, dealing withthe Russo-German peace negotiations, he challenged any single deputywho was in favour of joining in them to get up and say so, a challengewhich no one accepted. &quot; His last werds were of what could be hopedfor from Amerioa replacing Russia, as well as the further assistancethat might be got from &quot;other Allies who have not yet given us allwe have the right to expect from their devotion to the common cause&quot;.The speech was, as has already been said, received with a.mostuniversal praise.   But there is this to note in the comments upon it.Many of the writers who most warmly praise it say, as the Mbats says,&apos;we want something more&apos;. .  Even the Temps, which repudiates terri-torial debates at this stage as &apos;vain and dangerous&apos;, demands that weshould meet the German negotiations not by silence but by preachinga crusade of the oppressed peoples.   Others demand this not in sub-stitution for but in addition tt a precision of what our War-aimsactually are, and the Humanite is sanguine enough to believe that aformula of principles could be framed which could be applied to each case.     There is something like general agreement that the last Allied
Conference ought to have produced a new statement of war-aims and principles which would have encouraged all that is sound in Russia and exposed beforehand the German attempt to twist the Russian for-mulas into the service of their own Imperialism.   It was probably the weakest sfcep in II. Pichon&apos;s speech that he scarcely ventured on this ground.   Wo doubt he knew its dangers better than his critics:   and besides it is one that Prance cannot enter on alone.Of other matters there is little to say.   The French loan is an-nounced to be a great success, France alone having subscribed more th than the ten milliards asked for.   The introduction of bread cards has been postponed.   The reason given is that the success of volun-tary effort at reduced consumption gives hor*es of avoiding cards al-together.   Another reason may be that the municipalities of Bordeaux, Rochefort and other towns have refused to work them.   The other food regulations, which involve the closing $f confectionery shops, seems to have been fairly well received.   France is better fed than England, A shortage of food is less likely and less dangerous than one of fuel. But for the present there is no great risk of either.The discussion of the need for a Generalissimo of the Allied Armies still continues, such well-known persons as II. Hanotaux and K, Reinach writing in support of the demand.     But public opinion is getting to realise that whether desirable or not it is impossible; an army which contains the whole manhood of a nation, will not, as the Debats sees, be commanded by a foreign General, as the old pro-fessional armies of two hundred years ago were.   Moreover the whole     J nation is now so involved in the carrying on of war that a General has to be in constant touch, to&apos; a degree impossible to a foreigner, with all the machinery of government at home.   Probably not much more will be heard of the agitatinn.   The retirement of Sir. John Jellicoe has been made ah excuse for a revival of the demand for a more active British naval offensive.
