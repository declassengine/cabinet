MEMORANDUM FOR WAR CAB I RET SOUTH AFRICAN IDOL.It will have been gathered from the papers which I have circulated to the War Cabinet that a most difficult position$ gravely affecting the position of General Botha and bis Government, has arisen in tiouth Africa in consequence of the fact that the Americans and the Japanese are offering much higher prices than those at which we have bought our wool in the Jjnion.I have discussed the question both with General Smuts and with Sir A. Goldfinch,, the Director of Raw Materials at the War Office,   There can be no doubt that we urgently require the wool and that we shall be seriously inconvenienced by having to go m thouti .The War Office would, I understand, be prepared, notwithstand-ing difficulties to be apprehended with Australia and New Zealand, to offer a somewhat higher price, but I am strongly of opinion that this would not solve the problem and that there is in fact no alternative but to release those farmers who so desire from their bargain with us.    3 have consulted General Smuts - he regards the matter as one of the utmost urgency and he has convinced me that the offer to release must be made. This is accordingly the course which I shall recommend, when 1 bring the matter before the War Cabinet to-morrow.u t ... ICOLONIAL OFFICE, .8th January, 1918.*
