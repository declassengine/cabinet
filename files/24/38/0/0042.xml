q -q 2] T1H A R    CABINS T.. 3241.TXAGSS    AND    FOOD . PRICES. Draft Proclamation ley tho Ri^t, jion.,.GcNBarnes.In on honest effort to remedy an admitted anomaly the Groyonrnent recently sanctioned increase of wage to certain muni-tion workmen who had been prevented by tho Munition Acts from leaving one workshop for another, and whose wages had boon de-pros sod thereby.   It was found, however, impossible to keep within limits of tho original. Order; extensions have boon made .nnd each extension has led to claims being mode&apos; from workmen in rospoct to whom the Minister has no statutory power to incur public expendi-turo and some of whom rro not engaged in munition work. -Much ag-itat ion has ensued and has added to the difficulty of a position which had already been rendered difficult enough by the supcrces-si on of ordinary, methods of wage adjustments-.A condition of ferment has in fact been created which is ro-tarding production of those things essential for the prosecution of tho war.   Tho position has become intolerable and it is impera-tivcly necessary that it should bo cleared up.   There are certain border lino cases which the Linister of Munitions is adjusting by means of conferences of tho trades concerned. The Government is also willing that some consequential changes should bo made in trades which are interlocked with munitions and which, though not specified in the original Order, have put forward claims for in-clusion.   Those are being dealt with by the appropriate authorities as expeditiously as possible, though not necessarily on tho same basis either as to time or amount.But
But &quot;beyond &apos;these there can he no further extensions. Ana there can he no increase of wages for the period of the war except on proved increase of cost of living or some exceptional cause being shown,   In both Ccses, they must he adjusted through the ord^&amp;ary machinery or the organisation of Employers and employed, *ith resort, if necessary, tc theCommittee on production.The Government would once more urge upon workmen the need for resort to - systems of payment by results. . The present pressing need is for increased production and the Government feel confident that such increased production can best be obtained by honest dealing between Employers and employed on the principle of increased payment for increased effort.The Government look with confidence in   these last days of the war, to Employers and employed adjusting their differ-ence3 with a single eye to the.common good.     The collapse of Russia and the weakening of Italy have thrown upon us a great strain and a q?eat duty.     Moreover, the food prices ri.se sympathetically with increased wages..    These increased wages mean increase of public expenditure, dilution of currency and therefore, increased prices.     There are many poor persons who can ill afford to pay.     There are, for instance, the wives and dependents of our fighting men, those of fixed incomes and the great mass of labouring folk who are not engaged on public work, and who cannot get. increased wages because of relatively less demand for their labour,     It was because of those considerations th,/t the Government took the very unusual and drastic &amp;tep of subsidising the bread of the people, hut there is danger.now
now of the benefit of this being sacrificed to the poor by increased wages to relatively high paid workers and consequent lessened value of money..     This is obviously unfair to those who are already carrying an undue share of the burden of the War.Determined and sustained efforts are being made by thePood Controller and.local committees to keep pricesendown and to abolish the food queues,   Every/couragement will be given to these, and additional powers conferred if necesoary to secure distribution on the basis of share and share alike.It is by euch means as these that we can con-front the difficulties of the situation and not by a selfish struggle of class against class for excess wages or excess profits.       Neither can be allowed to continue without lessening--the national efficiency for the attainment of the national ideals.(Intd) G.$r.B.Whitehall. Gar dens,   .S.W, 7th January 1918,
