TtfPERTAT, MB t.0fIAT, ffiiTEHCE TK IBfciLAffl.Idmiralty Memorandum for the Committee of Imperial DefencsThe Admiralty have carefully considered the question of whether any measure of Independence of the Imperial Government in Haval matters could safely be given to the Irish Government in the event of self-government to the extent of a separate Parliament and Executive being, established in Ireland.   They are emphatically con-vinced that for the purposes of naval defence, whether Local or Imperial, no measure of Independence, either in -peace or war, should be allowed to that country:   it is altogether too integral a part of the British Isles even to admit of being administered in marine and naval matters on lines analogous to those followed in the more distant Dominions and Colonies&quot;8.The problem of Irish Haval Defence presents itself natural1 in four aspects:1.   Coast Bases2,   Coast&apos; Protection and Watching3.   Communications.4.   Defence of the Realm.1.   COAST BASBS.The present war has abundantly shewn that the pro tection of commerce proceeding to and from these Islands Is of paramount importance.    To afford the protection required arrange-ments have to be made whereby vessels can be met ana protected in the danger zone by: small craft, with a restricted radius of action, and in order to use these craft to the best advantage it is impera-ti to base them as far West as possible, with suitable harbours availab for the purposes of repair and refuelling, where they can lie secureagainst enemy attacks.    Craft thus employed mast necessarily belong ;he Imperial Government, and it is essential that the Dockyardto theand other bases, with their Commanding Officers and all their^ appurtenances, should be under the orders of the Imperial Government any form, of dual control would lead to confusion, and Ireland is so near to Great Britain that control must be exercised by the Imperial Government direct without reference to an intermediate Irish Authority.The same is true of air bases on the Irish&quot; Coast.    The&apos;Bar will require more and more stations in Ireland for extended scouting and anti-submarine work by aircraft over the Atlantic and also lee-sheds for aircraft blown awav from England,     These stations and sheds must also be controlled by the 1Imperial Government only.2.     COAST PK0T5CTIQH AND WATCiffllG.Coast batteries must presumably remain under the Imperial Military Authority as at present.Coa,si,sr.  Canada and Australia are, on their own stations, practically independent, and the Crown Colonies are empowered to -maintain vessels of war subject to conditions prescribed by Order in Council.
Coast watching (which is only used during war) has proved itself of value to the Navy during this war, especially for report-ing enemy submarines and vessels molested by the enemy, this latter purpose being of considerable importance, as it enables patrols to be sent to save the crews of the vessels attacked.    Conceivably the Coast Watching Service might be entrusted to the Rome Govem-ment of Ireland, but it would in that case have to be clearlv laid down that all reports must be sent to the Imperial Officers in Command at the bases, and it would appear more efficient and logical that this Service also should remain under the Admiralty. The same is true of the Coast-Guard.3.   CQIMJKICATIQMS. (a)   Wireless.Operations in Home Waters are intimately bound up with the efficiency of wireless stations, whether naval or commercial.      It is understood to be the Government1s intention to keep commercial wireless enterprise under closer control than has been the case in the past, and that all wireless stations established at present or in the future in British territory at home arid abroad will be regarded from the standpoint of their strategic value.(b) Submarine Cables.A large proportion of the direct cross-Atlantic submarine cables (   9 out of 12) land in Ireland, and the cable stations at and near Valencia are of the utmost importance to our communications with the U.S.A., Canada, the West Indies, and partly with Australia.   Tele-^rams from England for America are sent to Valentia for dispatch partly by three cables between Weston super-Mare and Waterville (near Valentia), and partly by cables between Fishguard and Rosslare and thence over the land-lines to Valentia? about one-third of the total cable traffic between Great Britain and America etc., passing over the landlines through the Soutfc of Ireland.(c) a^njjliasa.Landline communications connecting naval bases to wireless stations and war signal stations must be con-sidered as integral parts of such bases and stations..A sharp distinction could be drawn between landlines which form part of the system of defence and those which do not, and there might possibly be no objection to the latter being controlled by the local authorities.Apart from the exception referred to in (c) it is felt that all wireless, cable, telegraph and telephone conniunications and stations in Ireland must be regarded as part of the general system of defence and should, therefore., be controlled by the Central Imperial Authority.4.    WMCE.W.&apos;m.&apos;tiEWL-(a)   (lojtoljjjLcj^$aval Officers are stationed round the coast of Ireland who are -competent to administer
the Defence of the Realm Regulations as far as purely - Naval matters are concerned, but the control of the civil population and restriction of aliens in war time is. in the main, administered by other Authorities than the Admiralty and the closest co-operation between these Authorities ami the Admiralty is necessarv, the Admiralty being often from one point of view or another vitally interested in cases which are dealt with by another Authority.At the present time the Military and Police Authorities^in the United Kingdom can be relied on for co-operation, and the Admiralty is therefore content to leave many matters in their hands;   but if either the Military or Police Organisation were not sufficiently reliable, it would be necessary to establish a separate Naval Organisation to take their place.The problem is thus one of Imperial Administration, not of Local Government, and can more properly be dealt with as a whole by the direct control of the Imperial Government, which should reserve to itself full liberty of action.(b) Control of Shipping.There is an important group of the Defence of the Realm Regulations relating uo maritime matters, including the control of the Pilot Service. These Regulations^confer on the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping an almost unlimited control of such matters as the routes which ships may follow, the pre-cautions they mist observe, and-the defensive apparatus which they must carry,     They provide also for the punishment of undisciplined crews, for requisitioning shr; for prohibiting transfer of the registry of British ship-ping, for preventing congestion ofsports and harbours,and other such matters.    No doubt some of these regulations might well be administered by a separate Irish Government, but unless the Regulations adopted in Great Britain were also adopted and enforced in an identical manner in Ireland, there would be risk of confusion and the result would not be satisfactory.     These Regulations should, therefore, it Is considered, be framed and administered by one Authority for Great Britain and Ireland.(c) Power of Requisition.The powers of the Imperial Government to requisition ships,, land or other property ir Ireland in time of war must undoubtedly be retained.As regards the requisitioning of ships, the powers of the Shipping Controller are greater than those of the Admiralty and in effect give him. complete control over the whole of the British Mercantile Marinei   It would not be easy to exercise these powers independently of a separate Irish Government, particularly in view of the extent to which they are used in war, and may still have to be used for some time in peace, for the control.of civilian supplies;   but this should be a matter for admiiiistrative arrangement between the two Governments, as In the case of the self-governing Dominions, and not of legal power.    It is suggested that the powers must continue to be vested in the Central Authority.
For. purposes of the Defence of the Realm it is thus essential that the British Isles should continue to be treated as an integral whole of which Ireland is part, and that the Admiralty should be able to rely, as at present, on the loyal co-operation of other Imperial Departmental Authorities, especially the War Office, the Home Office, the Customs and the Police,Further instances indicating the necessity for the closest Inter-Departmental co-operation are to be found in con-nexion with the transport of naval and military personnel and stores to and from andacross Ireland, and the mediation of the Customs Service between the Admiralty and Siiipping.1.18.

IMPERIAL AND LOCAL DEFENCE IN IRELAND -Memorandum of Sub-Committee of Irish Convention enclosed in letter to Secretary of Admiralty.IRISH CONVENTION.A sub-committee has been appointed to report to the Grand Committee of the Irish Convention as to the requirements for Imperial and local defence in Ireland in the event of the Convention formulating a Scheme of Irish-Seif-G-overriment to be submitted for the approval of Parliament,These would include questions as to the extent of -Naval Control to be reserved to the Imperial Naval Authorities, their powers in time of peace, In time of special emergency, and during war, and as te the expediency and manner of creating a local or Territorial Force in Ireland comprising all questions as to how it should be raised, its organisation, its control, and its obligations and limitations.In order thattte Sub-Committee should be In a position te report on these matters it has been authorised to communicate with the Admiralty,    and obtain the views of the Naval Authorities en these matters.The following are the names of the members of the Sub-Committee The Earl of Desart,    (Chairman);   the Duke of Abercorn;   Captain Stephen Gwynn, M.P.,   Captain Doran, (Chairman, Louth County Council);    J.B. Powell, K.G.In order: that the sub-committee should be able to perform the task entrusted to them,    it Is essential that they should be in possession of the best expert- evidence on the technical matters with which they have te deal,    and they,    therefore,   beg to ask for the assistance of the Admiralty for this purpose.It would, as the Committee venture to suggest,   be convenient If they could be furnished In the first instance with a memorandum indicating the principal matters connected with        Naval defence in respect ef which special safeguards or special powers to be secured by Statute or otherwise would be necessary, and that a representative or representatives ofths Admiralty should be authorised to give the Sub-Committee any further information or assistance they might require b$[ oral evidence or otherwise. &apos; .
