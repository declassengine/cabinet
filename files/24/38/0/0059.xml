ENCLOSURE:LINSEED OIL FOR LINOLEUM MANUFACTURE. The Linoleum and Oil Cloth Industry .The position of the linoleum and oil cloth industry has:become extremely critical , chiefly fhrouch a shortage of linseed oil, but also (though to a loss extent) through a shortage of other materials especially &quot;cork and also pigments.   The facts are as follows.--1. The industry is one of the more important minor trades of the United Kingdom , our exports of Linoleum and Oilcloth haying amounted in value to  2.6 million in 1913, to  2.2 million in 1914   and to  1.6 million in 1915., During the war the industry has supplied a good deal of oilcloth etc   (including leather cloths and baizes) for warships , hospitals and other national purposes.   It is understood, however, that only about 25% of the output of the principle firms&apos; represents. Government orders and that these orders are usually for plain cloth and keeps only an inconsiderable part of the machinery running.   It would be uneconomic- for the works to run on Government Orders only.2. Linoleum manufacture is the principle industry of Kirkcaldy. and Lancaster and is also carried on to a considerable extent at other places , more particularly In and around London especial-ly at Staines.   Lancaster and Kirkcaldy have each a population of about 40,000 and are very largely,dependent on this industryi6. The number actually employed at the outbreak of war was about 11,000 and In October 1917 about 8,.000 . The number of men employed in the industry has of course declined, but the number of women employed has increased.. It is stated that of the men still employed at Kirkcaldy* the majority are between 60 and 70 years of age .4. Linseed oil: is essential for the manufacture of Linoleum andoil,cloth , and / despite all endeavours ^substitute for..it has been found .   The   Director of Oil wrote on December 20th to Sir Nor-val Helme   M...P. advising, the trade to make every effort to discover a substitute , but the Board of Trade inquiries show that this Is altogether impracticable;   The normal annual sgmh. -sumption of Lin&amp;oed Oil in the country. recently lr..s been ;:vbout 103,000 tons and during the w**r the consumption, for linoleum and oil cloth has been about 24,000 tons a your..5., There has now dev1 )ped a serious shortage of oleaginous produce which is under, the control of the Oils and Fats Depart^ ment of the Ministry of Food .. That Department have accordingly found it necessary to limit the use of vegetable oils to the: two most essential needs viz,, the production of (a) Margarine and,(b) glycerine.   They have informed the trade that no further supplies of linseed oil will be allowed , and have now issued-an order controlling, and enabling them to requisitionall linseed oil. Manufacturers of Linoleum &amp;c . may not commence to treat any oil for use in the manufacture of linoleum and oil cloth without consent of the Ministry of Food in each case.. The Ministry has offered to allow sufficient for Government- orders, but the Trade assert that these are insufficient to enable: the- &apos; trade to carry on.6. Oils suitable for food purposes are being used for margarine-and,those unsuitable for these purposes for glycerineThe latter class includes linseed oil. It is understood that 350,000 . tons of oils and fats are required for. the manufacture of margar-ine and a further 350,000 tons for the manufacture of glycerine,Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeM.M.87-. .
700,000 tons in all; but there will actually be-available, only 516,000 tons of oil on the assumption that none of this cargo is lost at sea..7.   As regards linseed oil the position is as follows:-.(i) On 30th September stocks still amounted to 52?000 tons(ii) The Ministry of Eood had arranged to import during the succeeding 12 months 314,000 tons of linseed which would have yielded about 103.000 tons of oil,(iii) The 314^000 tons of seed, however,  included 200,000 tons which were to have been brought fiom the ArgentineF Inasmuch however, as this import has been disallowed by the Treasury, we shall be able to import only about 114,000 tons of seed, equivalent to about 38,000 tons of oil.(iv) It follows that there will be sufficient linseed oil for the production of glycerine alone.8.   Glycerine can be made from other oils than Linseed wherea3 linoleum and oilcloth cannot.   If the policy of the Ministry of 5&apos;ood is persisted in, it will mean the complete closing down of the Linoleum industry.    Such a result would be. most unfortunate, whether from the standpoint of the capital invested in the industry, its value to our-oversea trade, or the hardships inflicted on a number of work-people and their dependents who could not readily be transferred to more essential industries.   American competition has developed during the war in the British Dominions.   The question for consideration therefore is whether and how far it may be possible to prevent,  or at least to mitigate,  the contingency described.9.    Such information as it has been possible to obtain suggests that stocks of linseed oil in the hands of linoleum makers may amount to about 6,000 tons (the treatment of the oil for this particular industry takes about 3 months).   Repre-sentatives of the industry have suggested that they should be allowed a reduced ration of 1G;000 tons a year,  including the stocks just mentioned.   This means an import of 10,000 tons of Oil (or 30,000 tons of seed).10.   The main question for decision is therefore whether including existing stocks, the,industry should be allowed a ration of 16,000 tons of linseed oil (this is little over 2% of the - amount, of oil required for margarine and glycerine)&apos;,   Inasmuch as seme 4,000.tons are consumed for Government work,  the allowance for ordinary trade would thus be only 12.00G tons. If it is decided that such.an allowance cannot be made,  then the industry will have to close down and a relief scheme for the districts affected may become necessary.The question, is accordingly submitted for the consideration of the War priorities Committee as a matter of urgency,
11.   -   There are a number or^ important^, hut subedAi^txy,..:.que-s .iiono-vUiich can be settled after a decision has; been given on the Linseed Oil question.    If it is decided that the maintenance of the Linoleum industry is sufficiently desirable to justify the allocation to it of the specified quantity of Linseed oil, fur-ther steps in certain ether directions.(e.g. the importation of certain consignments of cork which are awaiting shipment at Spanish and Algerian ports) could also be taken up,    If not, thai trie other questions fall.12.       In the event of it being decided to maintain the linoleum industry it would be .for the Board of Trade to arrange with the industry for securing the greatest possible economy of produc-tion whether by centralising output or otherwise, and for distributing the oil on some equitable basis among the various users.   The trade has already an organisation for such dis-tribution in respect of Zinc and Lead compounds.13.      The questions for decision are therefore(i)    Should the Linoleum industry be maintained by allow-ing it a sufficient ration of linseed oil (at least 16,000 tons)?(ii)    If so, should. (.a) additional shipping space be pro*-vided for 10,000 tons of oil (if obtainable from India) or 30,000 tons of linseed for this purpose as the case may be; .and (b) manufacturers of linoleum, etc. be left :free to .deal with stocks of linseed oil at present in their hands or held on their account?(iii)   If additional shipments are impossible should any contingent of linseed oil beyond the stocks mentioned in ii (b) be allowed to linoleum etc. manufacturers?- (signed);    A.H.

Memorandum by Mr. John Wonnald, ChairmaxJ of the Industries SuV Commit tee   of the G-cneral Services Committee on the subject of the Linoleum Trade -   to be considered in   conjunction with  Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade on the oubjeoi of Linseed Oil for Linoleum &quot;Manufacture.   (W,P. 34.)I have brought before the Industries Committee at their meeting this afternoon the very grave position that must arise if the supply of Linsesd Oil is to be cut off altogether from the Floorcloth and Linoleum Trade.This Industry, as you are no doubt aware, is centred in Kixkoaldy in Scotland, and in Lancaster in England, There are a few small Works of the same nature in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and of course there is the well-known Staines Linoleum Oompany in the vicihity of London.     The Trade is a very large one, both as to the amount of capital involved, and turnover, which in the last pre-war year amounted to  11,000,000 finding employment for 11,000 people, - a number reduced to 7,000 in 1916\ praotlcally all unskilled and much of it female.Thl3 Committee views with grave apprehension the closing of these great forks, more particularly in the case of Kirkcaldy, for they are practically all the town has to depend upon except Its fishing, and there will therefore be great difficulty in finding employment for the hands thrown out of work, except by complete migration,The Committee has made a very searching investiga-tion into the whole circumstances of the Trade, and has had before it the leading members of the Manufacturers1 Association, and also of the Non-Associated Firms, the principal of which are JamesWilliamson &amp; Son of Lancaster (of whioh Lord Ashton is the sole proprietor) and Storey Bros. &amp; Company.     All the firms have furnished every possible detail of their position, turnover, Stocks, &amp;c, and the Committee has been concerned to find them all the Lead and Zinc Products required to keep them going on a much reduced output.    A rationing authority, (Messrs. Marwick, Mitchell, Peat &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, of Glasgow and London) has been appointed by the Industries Committee to distribute the ration of these materials, equitably amongst the whole trade;   and this was in process when the Order in regard to Linseed Oil was issued.As a result, we have notified the Rationing Authority that the issue of the other materials granted to them must be withdrawn, for it would be absurd to give them the Lead and Zinc Pigments unless they receive the necessary proportion of oil &amp;c.SECRET.w. p. 3*1-
The Chairman.of this Committee has already dis-cuseed this matter at. considerable length with Sir Frank Gates, of the Food Controller^ Department, and all papers in connexion with our investigations are at the disposition of that Ministry.The opinion of the Industries Committee, taken at their meeting today, is that a very strong effort should be made to find Just, sufficient Linseed Oil to keep the Industry alive, say, to 25/  of its 1913 consumption. At the same time, the Committee suggests that the present stocks of Linseed Oil in the hands of the Trade, .which were found to be most unevenly divided, should &quot;be pooled for the benefit of the Whole Trade.     One of the largest films has only a two months&apos; stock, whilst another firm has 12 months1 supply,     As they have almost 6,000 tons of Oil in stock \as   per Board of Trade MeiiKia^andum of 1st January), and as this represents 2% of their pre-war consumption, they might be allowed to use this up, divided amongst the firms through the Rationing Authority dealing with Lead Compounds.It seems immediately opportune that the whole question of the supply of material necessary to carry on the Trades of the country, at the irreducible minimum, should be centred it a single unit., sa that the supply of one material at this irredunlMe ELlnlmum after care-fUl investigation shall not&apos; be nullified by^ier^ummary action of another I)e3)artment which has not had the same opportunities&quot;&apos; of investigating the case.(Signed) .
