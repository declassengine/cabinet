(T&apos;n;ent)WAR CABIHST.)atment of Dependants of Soldiers shot for disciplinary reasons. Ifemoranflum .by the Secretary of . State for, V/ar.The Army, Council-have noted the decision of the rfar Cabinet given at their 279th Meeting on the 21st November., 1917-, (War Cabinet 279 (9)), that in future the communication made, to the next-of-kin of a soldier who has been executed for cowardice or other crimes in the field should convey that the man has &quot;died on service&quot;.The Council are preparing the necessary change of-procedure,. but before putting it into action - would beg the Y/ar Cabinet&apos;to reconsider the quest-ion.     They wish to take the opportunity of placing on record that, as the facts are necessarily-known- to the man&apos;s comrades, they must soon come to the knowledge-bf the relatives through other than official channels.The -Council must point out that the news will thus come as a far greater/shock than if -it were conveyed originally in the official notificationo     In the earlier- stages of the war,&apos; the Council adopted much the same practice as that now decided upon, but they abandoned it when they found chat tne relatives were in the habit of printing memorial cards and marking in other similar ways the soldier&apos;s death as- the culminating event of an honourable career and a-worthy sacrifice .in a, noble, cause . -    They felt that by more prompt and official GGmmunications of-the real faces the relatives were spared the additional distress caused by a belated -revelation.of the truth.     They felt that this ought to be avoided.It also appeared to&apos;the Council open, to objection, s,nd likely.to cause the most widespread resentment, that such cases should be treated - as in any way similar tc those of men who had died fighting for their country.      In this connection they desire to associate themselves with Mr.. Hedges&apos; views, as expressed in T7ar Cabinet paper Ho. G.T. 2724.DERBY.7th January, 1918.
