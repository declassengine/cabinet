War Agricultural Committee to Secretary. War Cabinet^Staffordshire County Council, County Buildings, Stafford.5th January,  1918.Sir,The County War Agricultural Executive Committee have to-day considered the question of the maximum prices v/hich have been fixed for various commodities, and they are very strongly of opinion that the policy which has been pursued in the past for fixing maximum prices at a figure below that at which the articles can he produced is causing a serious shortage which will be accentuated in the near future.   They also considered the question of the maximum prices recently fixed for potatoes of the 1918 crop.    The minimum price for the 1917 crop was  6,  and as a result a large quantity cf potatoes was grown in the Country. Had this course not been adopted there would no doubt have been a very much smaller supply available.My Committee consider that unless the prices .for 1918 -are fixed at a ffigure equal to that of 1917 there will be a considerable redaction in the acreage under potatoes in the coming year especially in Counties not specially suited for Potato growing and in which it is important that the growth of Potatoes should be encouraged, and in consequence there will be a considerable reduction in the production of food in the country at a time when English grown food should be produced in more abundant quantities than ever before.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.) EUSTACE JOY,Hon. Secretary County War Agricultural Committee.
