SECRET. w      17v-___________ Copy No.   x 5Secretary,w-      War CabinetI forward, for circulation to the War Cabinet, the following extract from a letter, dated 2nd instant, address-ed to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff by General Sir H. Plumer, General Officer Commanding the British Forces in Italy:-x x x x x x&quot;The French did a very good attack against the &quot;Austrians the other day as you will have seen.     They con-&quot;centrated plenty of artillery (we helped them a good deal &quot;with counter-battery work) and then the Austrians put up no Hfight at all. .&quot;It was a really good example to the Italians and will &quot;do them good.     I wish we could do something of the same &quot;kind but as you know the left French division (the one that &quot;attacked) is the only one of the French or British that has &quot;not got the Piave in front of it - and every idea of advanc-&quot;ing our line the other side of the river is for the present &quot;out of the question.     All we can do is to try raids - and &quot;those are not very easy.     The 41st made a very good effort &quot;last night and got a good many men across but they did not &quot;effect a surprise and only got a few prisoners.     I believe &quot;they killed a good many.&quot;We are sending up all our heavy artillery which is not &quot;on our front to help the Italians in the mountains and have &quot;got enough winter clothing and. equipment for them.&quot;The Italians are certainly getting steadier and are &quot;gradually taking up srme of the things we have tried to &quot;point out to them.     But all this has to be done very quiet-:ly and patiently.&quot;I have written to you officially in this sense as re-&quot;gards the attendance of Italian officers at our Schools.&quot;I quite realise what you say about the future.&quot;At present the Italians are too much concerned with &quot;hanging on to where they are to consider any Spring plans -&quot;but we must have some ready.&quot;xxx xxxWar Office, S.VM.
