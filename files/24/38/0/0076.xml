THE Ig^7EMBRYO GOVERNMENTS IN SOUTH RUSSIA. Memorandum by Lord ElinorHaving since my visit to Paris with Lord Robert Cecil, devoted some time to analysing the numerous reports which we dsily receive on the above subject, from our various agents, end checking them by such outside information as I have boon able to obtain, I circulate the following brief notes.     I think they nay bo useful to those of my colleagues, who, being fully oecu-pied with other work, may not have had the seme opportunity as I hsve had of sifting this mess of confusing and often contra-diet o ry ma t e r i a1.As far as I can make out, there are 4 separate districts ofSouth Russia, where the tendency to set up independent localGovernments has assumed considerable proportions0     These are;-The Ukraine BessarabiaThe S u 3a s tern ?o . er a tion Trans-Oauca suoIt is quite possible that none of th-se - movements may ultimately come to anything,,   But they all have, for the time being, some importance, and though differing materially from one another and being perhaps,  for geographical and other reasons, incapable of forming an effective coalition, they have at lesst this in com-aon, that they are opposed to the Bolsheviks and are striving, amid the general chaos, to &quot;keep their own end up&quot; and to resist clictstiori from the temporary holders of power&quot;In Petrograd and the ivorth. THSJJZRAII^This is by far the largest in population, if not in super-ficial area.     It consists of e continuous block with a homo-geneous population.   These ere the &quot;Lit lie Russians&quot; or itothenes., as they are called in Galicia, the Eastern Province of Austria, with which the Ukraine marches.     They are hostile to the Poles, their immediate neighbours on the H.West,  u*ho also

The prospect of success is not great, as the Russian Armies on this front are rapidly dissolving and there is so far no evidence of any considerable organised Ukrainian force to take their place.-In any case there can be no question of the Ukraine taking an active part against the Central Empires.   Austrian Influence has always been strong in.the Ukraine,   The President of the Ukraine Parliament, Chrushevski, is said to be strongly Austro-phll.   All accounts agree that what the Ukrainians want is peace.   They also want to complete the process, already to all appearance far advanced, of appropriating tho lands of thenobility/
mobility - mostly polish - and making the country wholly one of peasant proprietors.     On the other hand they are not Socialists, in the Bolshevik sense.     Little Aussia has always differed in its agrarian organisation from Great Russia, in that it has &quot;been a land of individual uather than communal ownership.-,It is this difference of social organisation as well as the difference of race, which perhaps accounts for the fact that the revolution has assumed a somewhat different form in the Ukraine from what it has in Great Russia, and that the former has from the first taken a line of its own independent of Petrograd..    This separatist tendency h-ss certainly become more marked since the Bolshevists have come into power.3ome 3 weeks ago the Ukraine Government (Ra&amp;a), through its &quot;Secretary for International Affairs,&quot; addressed the represents-  &apos; tives of the allied Powers at Petrograd in the name of the &quot;Ukrainian -Republic&quot; to the effect, that his Government regarded itself as allied to the Powers at war with Germany and Austria, and that, while anxious for peace, it wanted to carry on peace negotiations &quot;in agreement with the -allied Powers&quot; and to resist demobilisation, release of prisoners or intercourse with the enemy (Sir GD Buchananrs telegram i*o0 2060K    At the same time, and ever since, the Ukraine Government has been appealing to the Allies for financial assistance, and has apparently been receiving some from the French, and a little from us (through Sir Go Barclay at Jassylo     The latest reports, however, show that it is dis-satisfied with the limited amount of funds placed at its disposals This is due, no doubt,  to the difficulty of actually getting the money into its hands, as both the French and British Governments have given their agents very great latitude in the matter of financial help to the Ukraine,Another grievance of the Ukraine Government is that it has not been officially recognise! by the Allies0     On December 30th Major Fitzwilliam, who is now our military representative atKieff/
KiefI, ^ired that the Allies were losing --round owing to their delay in officially recognising the Ukraine Government.   And this is confirmed by a telegram of General Borter to CI.G.8.dated 1st January.   General Barter had then just left Kieff for Petrograd, He lias always been pessimistic about the Ukraine and in the tele-gram just referred to repeats his conviction that &quot;whether in a military, economic or popular sense the Ukraine Government has little stability&quot;&apos;.   He does not believe that the Ukraine troops will fight, though ho admits that the Bolshevik troops are no better.As a matter of fret the Ukrainians have so far been cuccess-ful in my conflicts - these have apparently not been very serious - between them and the Bolsheviks.   They have disarmed several Bolshevik regiments rnd have prevented Bolshevik forces passing through their country &quot;to attack the Don Cossacks.Their relation to the Don Cossacks is ill defined.   The Ukrainian Government, though anti-Bolshevik; is out and out revolutionary.   The Cossack movement, on the other hand, though mainly a movement for local independence, has a somewhat more reactionary tendencv.   Hence there is no alliance between Ukrainians end Cossacks, only on understanding to give one another mutual support against Bolshevik aggression.For the rest the Ukrainians are now (1) opening negotiations with the Central Powers for a peace of&apos; their own; (2) inquiring of the Petrogjrad Government whether it regards itself as being at war with the Ukraine.    The former step seems inconsistent with the declaration, quoted rhove, that the Ukraine- did not wont to make pca.ee except &quot;in agreement with the Allies&quot;. The position of the Ukraine Government is obviously very shaky and, the outcome of the whole movement quite incalculable.   The only tiling that can be certainly said is that the Ukraine is intensely anxious to be let alone and is looking in every direction for help to maintain its independence,   whatever can be done tc prevent its fallingunder
under the influence of the Control Powers rill no doubt be done h the French, who, under the -agreement node r,t P-ris on Dec.--4th, ore responsible for Allied interests in the Ukraine and Who hove in Grneral Dertholot end his large staff, working from lonarnia, a very energetic body of agents.   Our Own. represent tr-tives in the Ukraine it present are Lajor Fitzwilliem and :.i\E--gr:e, our Consul at Odessa, who has been ordered to go up to Kieff, thougli I hove not yet heard of his having arrived there. The most important&apos; favourable factor is that, owing no doubt to the French influence, General Tcherbo.tchev,. commanding the Russian forces on the Roumanian border - who, recently, with the aid of the Houmanirns5 defeated a Bolshevik plot against himself -Vg apparently been&apos; accepted by the Ukraine G-overnment as the herd of their armed forces.   Tho telegrams are not very clear on this point, but on the. whole I think this is a correct reading of them, and, if so, it is all to the good.Our i.vformation about this country is extremely meaore. -Its importance, of course, lies in its geographical situation. a comparatively small though fertile province, with a couple of million people as contrasted with the 30 millions of the Ukraine, it nevertheless forms the link between the Ukraine and Pioumrnia. AH that we know about its attitude, however, is that it is trying to cot up a Government of its own.   This Government apparently consists of very young and inexperienced men, and is, to all appearance, even weaker than that of tho Ukraine.   Like the latter it seems to be agrarian revolutionary in character, but -mother or not it is really in sympathy with the French attempt to create a houmrnian-Bessarabian-Ukrrine block against the Central lowers there is nothing to show,- except for the solitary fact stated by the French (telegram, from the British mission, Paris, to -;rr O^ice, 3rd Jan.), that General Tcherbatchev has now, bvmjxpment
agreement with the Bessarabian authorities,, giv&quot;en orders to a. Servian regiment from Odessa to guard the Bessarahian rsilway line, whioh is the main line of supply for the Russo-Roumanian Front,   It must be borne in mind in this connection that the population of Bessarabia- is largely Roumanian.   Bessarabia also has a large Jewish population, in which respect it resembles the Ukrsdns .SOUTH EASTMFEpil^ATJpH (COSSACKS)In contrast to the case of Bessarabia, there is a great quantity of information on this subject, but it is extraordinarily confused and often contradictory.   The following interpretation of it is the best I can at present make of the material,, but it may be found to need correction in many particulars.The South Eastern Federation is in the main a Cossack move-  &quot; ment,  and its principal.- centre seems to lie in the Southern Cossack country.   This country extends roughly from the borders of Skaterinoslav and Kharkoff (the most eastern provinces of the Ukraine) on theWest, to the Volga on the East,, and southwards to the northern slopes of the Caucasus,    It is important, however to notice in this connection that the two Eastern provinces of the Ukraine have a mixed population..   They are less predominantly Little Russian than the centre and west of the Ukraine territory. Moreover - as stated, in a recent telegram of General 5arterTs the Bolsheviks now hold all the railway junctions in the Eastern Ukraine,  and therefore coj-^unications are practically severed between Kieff and the Don.Among the Southern Cossacks a position of predominance belongs to the Cossacks of the Don Province, which contains the Donetz Basin and the Southern Basin of the Don.   The chief cities of the Province are itfovotcherkask and Rostoff.   Immediately South of the Don-Cossacks is the territory of the Kuban-Cossacks border-ing on the Black Sea.

The capital of the Kuban district is Ekaterinodar.   Purther to the South-East again, and tending towards the Caspian, are the Terek-Cossacks, abutting, on their Easternconfines
confines, upon &amp; Tartar and Circassian population. ^ 03The Don-Kuban-Terek-Cossaek oountry is a very large and more or leas continuous territory, though it has a very thin waist, where the Kalmucks, who stretch from the Caspian Sea south of Astrakhan nearly to the Elack Sea, impinge upon it. But therefore other large Cossack districts to the East and North-East, though they are divided from one another and from the solid Southern block by non-Cossack populations.   Such are the Cossacks of Astrakhan, the Ural, Orenburg and Ufa on the extreme limits of Europiean Russia, while other Cossack settlements extend well into Siberia and touch at various important points the great trunk line, which traverses that country to Vladivostock.It will thus be seen that the Cossack territory, taken as a whole, is of great extent, and that considerable Cossack popula-tions hold positions of first-rate importance in the very centre of the Russian Empire,   moreover they are a very independent body of people, who have always been, in cbntrast to the bulk of the ^reat Ru39ians, to whom they are raoially akin, free men and land-owners, mostly small.   In return for military services to the Government, they have enjoyed speoial privileges of which they are very tenacious, mdt while culturally even less developed than the mass of the Russian people, they have strong traditions and are, comparatively speaking, conservative.   Though not devoid of a certain democratic spirit, they are much less likely to be swept off their feet by each fresh revolutionary wave than the rest ofthe Great Russians.   They are frontiersmen, who have for generations been the bulwark of Russia against the Turks and kongols.What their present disposition is we can only guess - we arc really very much in the dark about it - but all indications point to the fact (and their history confirms the assumption) that they will remain intensely independent,  comparatively conservative, and will,  in any case, present a formidable obstacle to the permeation of Russia   by foreign influence, while, if organised, they might become a very formidable power.   It is therefore, quite absurd, in my opinion, to brush the Cossacks aside - as one of our agents does,  after having spent a few
he found everything in chaos - as ^absolutely useless and disorganised&quot;    (Sir G. Barclays telegram, No. 7 6). Novotcher-kask is, after all, only one of the points of Cossack concen txation, though, so far, the most importants or at least the one about which we know most (there are some indications that the Orenburg and Ufa Cossacks, who extend on to the trans-Siberian line, are developing considerable strength).   But even at Hovotcherkask, as later reports show, the forces form-ing under General Alexeieff are not altogether contemptible, It is true that, like all these embryo local armies, they are desperately short of money and screaming for financial help from the Allies as well as for recognition.     The French have promised them 100 million roubles, but it is probably easier to promise a hundred than to get one actually into their hands. And even if Alexeieff succeeds in forming an army, we cannot expect it to do much outside its own country.It is evident that the Cossask movement, though quite different in character from that in the Ukraine or in Trans-Caucasia, has at least this in common with all the rest - that its main purpose is not aggressive but defensive.     These peop.8 all want to maintain their own independence and property and not to be interfered with by Bolsheviks or an^oody else.,     Kale din has over and over again made this very clear. and though Alexeieff - who is apparently a stronger man, and in certainly the main military organiser at liovotcherkask - may have bigger ideas, it is doubtful whether even he, not to say the various political leaders from Northern Russia     Ro&amp;sianko, MiliukoVj Savinkov. etc.- who are reported to be at Rovoioeher-kask, will succeed in getting the Cossacks to do mere than defeat their own territory,   But even that may he of considerable impori ance to the Allies, especially if thi? northern (Orenburg and Ufa) Cossacks-succeed in getting hold of positions such as Perm and Samara on the trans--Siberian railway, and so cutting the con-nection between the Bolsheviks in Northern Russia and theirfellow
fellow Bolsheviks at Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk/ Chita and Vladivostok. But it is fair to say that, about this Northern Cossack movement, of which General Dutoff, of whom I know nothing, seems to be the leader, our information is very sketchy, and derived almost en-tirely from newspaper reports.     On the other hand, we have it in the official telegrams, that the South Eastern Union or Federation which I conceive to be another term for the Cossack movement -includes the Astrakhan, Ural and Orenburg Cossacks in the East and North-East, as well as the Don, Kuban and Terek Cossacks in the   ! South-East, together with the Kalmucks, the peasants of the Stav-ropol Government, and the mountaineers of the Caucasus (Sir George Buchanan&apos; s telegrams of the 29th November, No.. 1896 and Jam 3rd&apos; No. 17.     Compare also Colonel Pike&apos;3 telegram     ton Tiflis, Jan. 3rd, which talks of 145,000 men as being at the disposal of the South Eastern Federation, though these are apparently only the Don Kuban and Terek forces).This mysterious &quot;Federation&quot; is at present certainly only the embryo of a state.     Its civil capital - if one can talk of it having a ,capital - appears to be at Ekaterinodar in the Kuban Cossack country, and its President a man called Chalmakoff, but what his relations precisely are with the military leaders like Alexeieff and Dutoff, is perfectly obscure.     The only thing which is evident is that there is some sort of regular communication, and a tendency to combine between the various Cossack movements: that collectively they are a considerable force:   that their lean-ings are decidedly anti-Bolshevik, and that where - as at Rosto f and in the North - they have actually had fights with the Bolshe-viks, they Beem generally to have got the best of it.Like the Ukraine, and indeed like all these embryo States, the South Eastern Federation appears to aim, not at separation, but at a position of complete autonomy within a Russian Federal Union.There is just one more point about the South Eastern Feder-ation, which seems important to bear in mind.   The Terek-Cossackawho
to.ffh0 are on the extreme Tight wing of the South Cossack block.but upon Mohammedan tribes dwelling on the northern slopes of th^Caucasus..   Now it is certain &quot;that :the Bolsheviks are playing uphard to all the Russian Moslems and, among others, to these hilltribesmen,  and that fear of an attack from them is paralysing theTerek and to some extent even the Kuban Cossacks.   I call attenrtion in this respect to an important telegram from the MilitaryAttache&apos; at petrograd (sir George Buchanan1 s No. 2125), in whichthe following passage occurs:-&quot;I had long conversation tor day with an officer who has just returned from Northern Caucasus.   He argues that we are making serious error in not sending representative to Ekaterinodar headquarters of South Eastern Union.   Be says main problem now is to cement alliance between Mohammedan tribes of Caucasus and Kuban and Terek Cot&amp;scks an alliance which Bolsheviks are doing all they can to prevent,    Cnoe (?&apos;Den) Cossacks felt their rear was safe they won]d act with more decision.    Alliance feels real want of moral support from AlliesI call particular attention to this because there seems tobe a general impression that the South Eastern Federation movementis the same as,  or at least intimately connected with,  the auto1-nomy movement in Trans-Caucasia,  and that we can deal with theformer from Tiflis.    I am convinced that this is a grave mistake,as I hope to show presently, under the head of .Trans-Caucasia. -No doubt there are communications between the South Eastern Federa-tion and Trans-Caucasia, and to some extent the two may be willingto make common cause.    But the two movements are different incharacter and must be handled separately*    To influence the SouthEastern Federation we need to be strongly represented at Ekaterinodar.-HLIlip g-^oas i aThe southern part of the territories comprised in the South Eastern &quot;Federation marches with Trans-caucasia,  the dividing line being,  roughly speaking,  the main range of the Caucasus.   The Population of Trans-Caucasia is made up mainly of 3 races - the Georgians, Armenians &amp;h&amp; Tatars.    Tiflis,  the capital,  is inGeorgia
Geogia, which is the western portion of trans-Causasia, extend-ing to the Black Sea..    In the rest of the country the races are considerably mixed up, the Armenians being mainly in the centre and south about Erivan and Kafs, while the &apos;T-it *rs  predominate in the Eastern Districts, bounded by the Caspian and containing the important town of Baku.The Georgians and Tatars; are each about 2 million strong, the Armenians rather less numerous, though in wealth, culture and intelligence they are in advance of the other races.     The great bulk of.the.Armenian race, however, are across the border in Turk-ey, where they form the bulk of the population in 6 Vilayets, extending nearly as   far as the Mediterranean.     If the Armenian population of the Turkish territory recently conquered by Russia is added to that pf Trans-Caucasia, the Armenians now under the Russian flag must equal or outnumber the Georgians and Tartar&apos; Tatars combined.The 3 races have had various feuds with one* another.     At one time the Georgians and Tatars made common cause against the Armenians.     Latterly the Armenians and Georgians have been draw-ing closer together in opposition to the Tatars.     In all 3 races the revolutionary ferment has been working strongly for more than a decade, and though, exeept among some of the Tatars, at and about Baku, there seems to be no Bolshevism, we must regard the Trans-Caucasians generally as strong adherents of the revolution. In this respect they differ from the Cossacks of the    :&apos; . South Eastern Federation, as is pointed out by Major Keyes in a most important telgram of Sir G,Buchanan&apos;s of Jan.3rd (Eo.l6). &quot;South Eastern Federation,&quot; it is there stated,&quot;only loosely includes certain tribes on riorinern slope of Caucasus watershed,- while Armenians and Georgians of Trans-Caucasus are entirely out of touch with it.&quot;     The telegram goes on to point out, that it is essential to keep a clear distinction in our minds between the Souin Eastern Federation (Cos sack:)&apos;movement and the corresponding movement in Trans-Caucasia, which has its centre at Tiflis..   &quot;Themarked
3d political difference&quot; - I am again quoting from tho sane r,m - &quot;between Trans-Causasus and South Eastern Confederacy to homo in mind.     Former is at present pre-eminently Socialist, lo mtter is constitutional with tendency towards monarchism, possesses strong military elements.       Constant danger of friction m the two makes it imperative they should he dealt with on [5rant lines&quot;,As a matter of fact it is quite clear that Trans-Caupasia10t joined the. South 1!astern Federation, although there haveI conferences between the parties- and a union of the two has3 th-n once been mooted (see Mr. Steven1s telegram from Tiflisjc. 22nd, No. 7). ?:hat has happened in Trans-Causasiaif scorns to be this:   a provisional local Government has boon&apos; at Tiflis for the country south of the Caucasus., which re-36 to rc-cogniso the authority of the Bolsheviks, though itclaims -any intention of separating from Russia,     The Commandertho Caucasus Army; Prjevalski, is in sympathy with this movement.th:j Rns si a army 0f the - Caucasus boing in a s tat 0 of dissolution,0-7 Volunteer Army is in course of formation to replace it, --nthdouble object of keeping order in the country, end holding theoor -igalnst the Turks, who fortunately seem for tho moment toeither numerous nor enterprising in this quarter,        Ths most-;it necessity appears to bo to get rid of the old Russian Army,is a positive source of danger to the country.

)otf without money the whole thing will collapse,   On the other ,2$   it seems that, given financial support, and senna political usance, we really have here the nucleus of a considerable force. fcr- new Army&quot;, says Major Pike, &quot;is increasing every day&quot;. g again, &quot;a militia is being formed in Turkish conquered territory, bier, will later on become regular troops.     Tho formation of this lit is progressing satisfactorily at present.     Two regiments 573 already occupied positions evacuated by Russian troops, and Ithsrs are holding railways and linos of communication&quot;.Major Pike, who has replaced General Shore as our military prosontative at Tiflis, seems an energetic and capable officer, 5 &quot;..0U ere sending Major General Dunstervillo and a number of fficors to Tiflis, but es they have to come from India and opotamia, it will be some time before they get there,     Svcry-ng depends on our being able to supply funds to enable Major ike and Mr. Stevens, our Political Officer at Tiflis, to keep ;ho new army going, until Dunsterville and his staff arrive to .00k after it.       The importance of holding Trans-Caucasia can iortainly not bo exaggerated, as unless we succeed in this, there s a danger of tho Turks not only recovering the Armenian provinces, hich have been conquered, by the Russians, but establishing cormeo-ion with the Turkish population of Northern Persia (Aserbaisan) &amp;p rrith the Russian Moslems, who, as already stated, are being sedulously wooed by the Bolsheviks,     Such a combination would Assent a now and very real danger to our whole position in the j&apos;ist.     On the other hand wo have in the anti-Bolsheviks of Trans-^nicasia and the conquered Turkish provinces, especially the Fenians, the nucleus of an Army, which, if organised and&apos;led, :oi1ld certainly fight, as it is a question of life and death to &quot;ten tc resist a Turkish invasion.Of all the various districts of Southern Russia, which are Juggling for local autonomy, Trans-Caucasia so ems thus to be both foe most promising and by far the most vital from the point of view 21 British interests.     I think we ought, in the first instance atany
II rato, to concentrate our efforts upon, keepljagrthe Trms-HJaueas-ta. r ovisional Government an.61 its new Army upon their legs.     If we ccsed in doing so, we shall also indirectly strengthen the South stern Federation.But this enterprise, though of the first importance, and i certain respects very promising, is undoubtedly exposed to great .sks of failure.     It is a race against time, for with the dissolving jssina Army roving about the country and pillaging the towns, with irds mid Turkish brigands from Persia making inoursions from the rath USast, and with danger threatening from the Bolshevik movement long the Ta tars at Baku (-here Turkish emissaries ara also said : te making mischief), the new Trans-CaueaslaiArmy will have to be*rganised quickly, if the whole country is not to be pronged into haos,      In that case General Dunstervillo and his officers may \rrive too late, indeed they may never be able to get there.   The one hing, which stands out quite clearly is that unless we can find a means i financing Tiflis without delay - what we have been able to do so sr is only a very small instalment of what is needed - the game will e lost.     If adequate financial help can only be given by enabling te local government at. Tiflis to raise a loan, I do not think that n.y scruples about the recognition of that Government should be ell owed o stand in the way.flatlfl.)     M.i Whitehall Gardens, 3.W 9th January, 1918.
