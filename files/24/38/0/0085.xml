SECRET.INTELLIGENCE BUREAU,34Department of Information.., n CRW/035.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XXXV.The Bolsheviks and the Peace Negotiations.During the last week the centre of interest has been the development of the peace negotiations with Germany.     Trotski!s appeal to the Allied Governments to join him in a general peace met with no response, with the result that negotiations for a separate peace were opened between Germany and Russia.      The Russian terms of peace included one clause which it was obvious that the German Government could never agree to, as.it applied the principle of self-determination to people within the frontiers of existing States Y/ho had not hitherto been independent.      This clause could, of course, only be applied In the event of a general peace, as it was obvious that in any separate peace between Germany and Russia the latter would not feel bound to raise any other questions of self-determination than those immediately concerning Germany and Russia.   Hence the only questions that arose were those of Poland, Courland and Lithuania.It was anticipated by many who doubted either the honesty or the determination of the Bolsheviks that they would give in to the Germans on the application of their principles to the disputed territories.   Stories of Bolshevik corruption or weakness as a result of the breaking up of the Russian army made many people prepared to see the Bolsheviks sell their country to the Germans or at any rate yield ignominiously to force majeure. The very opposite was the case.   The refusal ofithe Germans to agree to withdrawing their armies from the occupied territories in order that a proper plebiscite might be held led to the breaking off
of the peace negotiations and a savage attack on the Germans in the official press.     The press attack in the Prayda was conducted by Radek, a Russian Jew of the name of Sobelsohn, who for some months past has been the leading Bolshevik agent in Stockholm and is now Trot8ki&apos;s chief adviser on German affairs.   While in Stockholm Radek was in close touch with the German Socialist leaders, especially the Majority, and, thanks to his intimate knowledge of German politics, he is in a peculiarly favourable position to do the . German Government the maximum amount of harm in its attempts to negotiate with the Bolsheviks,   It may be taken for granted that in the German negotiations Trotski will very largely be guided by Radek&apos;s advice.In the present Bolshevik Government the three most interesting figures are Lenin, Trotski and Radek.    During the peace negotiations Lenin&apos;s name has not appeared, though that must not be taken to imply that his influence is any less than that of Trotski. IIth the Russian masses Lenin means far more than Trotski.     Lenin is the most consistent politician in Russia;   he has never wavered since the beginning of his career, whereas Trotski has been far more supple and more undecided as regards tactics.     By temperament Trotski is the direct opposite of his chief.     Lenin is visionary, fanatical, wit  no sense of humour;   Trotski is equally fanatical in defence of principles, equally unwilling to compromise, but with a keen sense of humour and with great ambition.   His head is more likely to be turned than Lenin&apos;s, and, strange   as it may appear, Lenin is probably the steadying influence.Radek is still more unrestrained than Trotski.   It was he who was the author of the article attacking Germany under the title of &quot;The Mask Torn Off&quot;, and it was he who insisted on raising the question of thjfr arrest of Liebknecht.    It is not unlikely that his
colleagues may think it is a mistake in tactics to raise the question of the imprisonment of German Socialists, as the ordinary Russian takes little interest in the sufferings of German &quot;comrades&quot;, and the raising of any issue that might cause difficulties in the way of peace would be regarded as both unnecessary and provocative.possibilities in the Near Future.The Bolsheviks have taken a firm stand on principles from which, even if they wished it, they could hardly draw back. They cannot any longer hope, if they ever did hope, that the Allied Governments would join in the peace negotiations with Russia and the Central Powers at Stockholm.   They will, therefore, in all probability resume negotiations with the Germans.   The beau geste with which Trotski broke off the negotiations a few days ago was primarily meant for the German people, and there is little doubt that further insults are in reserve for the German militarists. The prolongation of the negotiations, therefore, will hardly be to the taste of the latter, and it is probable that they will tkke the initiative either in the direction of a climb-down, which would form the basis for a separate peace, or in the direction of a flat refusal to accept the Russian terms.The chances are that the Germans are already intriguing with the political opponents of the Bolsheviks, whether Social Revolutionaries or bourgeois political parties.     The Germans probably realise that there is no party in Russia less likely to abandon its principles than the Bolsheviks, and they must sigh for a Government that would be guided by notions of Realpolitik instead of socialist ideals.   If this be a correct reading of the situation the maintenance of the Bolsheviks in power is for the
esent in the interest of the Allies, however lavish the present lers of Russia may be In their insfclts to all bourgeois and periallst Governments.   How long Trotski will remain in power ill depend upon his own statesmanship.    The majority against himthe Constituent Assembly is a less serious menace than it ppears, and he may risk calling it on conditions which may not be efused.    It must be remembered that the elections for the onstituent Assembly were held in November at the beginning of he Bolshevik regime, before men were able to realise their Btrength or their ab ility;    for that reason it is very doubtful hether new elections at the present moment would not result in a Bolshevik majority.     If Trotski uses his- &quot;right of recall&quot; he may yet secure a majority soon after the Constituent Assembly meets. In any case, in spite of the hostility of the present Constituent &quot;Assembly, it would not be safe to count upon the fall of the Bolsheviks for a considerable time to come, -and, while peace is being discussed, it will almost certainly be the Bolsheviks who will conduct the negotiations.   Thus, whether  he Bolsheviks are immediately recognised or not by the Allies, it is with them probably that questions of a general or separate peace will have to be discussed and not with any other party in Russia.There is no doubt that the Germans desire a separate peace with Russia, though not as a result of a climb-down on their part, as such a climb-down would be a severe blow to German militarism. If the German militarists are sufficiently strong, therefore, they will perhaps break off negotiations with the Bolsheviks, intrigue with the opponents of the Bolsheviks, and rely upon the threat of an invasion to Induce the Russians to agree to a German peaoe in Eastern Europe.     It is as yet impossible to say whether the Bolsheviks,if thoy failed to get peace and defied the armed might of Germany,stillwould/retain the support of the war-weary masses In defence of aPrinciple,9.1,18.
