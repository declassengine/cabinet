(This Teiegram is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and should be returned to the Offices of the War Cabinet for transmission to the Colonial Office when done with unless required for official use.)PARAPHBASE TELEGRAM. ^46Prom the Governor General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received Colonial Office 12.3 a.m,7th January,1918)Attention is invited by Ministers to the serious position which has arisen in the Union in regard to sale of wool.    They think it desirable to recapitulate negotiations which took place between themselves and His Majesty&apos;s Government.In the first instance His Majesty&apos;s Government     j made the sale offer for South African wool as had been made to and accepted by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, viz., to purchase whole 1917-1918 clip at a price b% higher than the prices ruling in 1913-1914.His Majesty&apos;s Government also undertook at the request of the Union Ministers to take over on the same terms any balance of 1916-1917 clip which still remained in South Africa unsold.While thanking His Majesty&apos;s Government for their offer the Union Government stated &quot;there was a strong feeling among farmers that the basis of pur-chase should, be substantially higher than that offered!! His Majesty&apos;s Government replied that in view of arrangements existing with the Governmemt of Australia and the Government of New Zealand they regretted that they could not contemplate the purchase of the wool clip of South Africa on a higher price basis thanthat
urn . jthat arranged with Australia and New Zealand.After further consideration Union Government then stated they saw no prospect of carrying through sale of whole clip to His Majesty1s Government since they were not prepared to prohibit export of wool to countries other than United Kingdom and because partof the new clip had been sold already.    As it had-   - IIbeen represented to the Union Government nov/ever thatmany persons were anxious to benefit by the offer ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government Ministers enquired whetherHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to takeon the same terms such portion of clip as the pro-ducers migjat voluntarily offer before a certain date.His Majesty1s Government assented under the j. . ..... . ...... Ijcircumstances and in order to meet the wishes of Government of South Africa and of these persons and under this modified scheme about 170,000 bales were offered.It has throughout been recognised that the prospects of disposing of the South African wool clip to other purchasers than His Majesty&apos;s Government depend on availability of freight to remove wool from the Union.    The belief that freight for wool sold to outside purchasers would steadily become more difficult to obtain was one of the most important factors which determined producers to sell their wool to His Majesty1s Government.     Ministers are not of course able to forecast shipping position (?which) may vary from day to day.    But the fact remains that recently a certain amount of tonnage has been avail-able for wool for America and Japan and that in theopen
that arranged with Australia and New Zealand.After further consideration Union Government then stated they saw no prospect of carrying through sale of whole, clip to His Majesty&apos;s Government since they were not prepared to prohibit ^export of wool to. countries other than United Kingdom and because part of the new clip had been sold already.    As it had been represented to the Union Government however that many persons were anxious to benefit by the offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government Ministers enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to take on the same terms such portion of clip as the pro-ducers migjbt voluntarily offer before a certain date.His Majesty&apos;s Government assented under the circumstances and in order to meet the wishes of Government of South Africa and of these persons and under this modified scheme about 170,000 bales were offered.It has throughout been recognised that the prospects of disposing of the South African wool clip to other purchasers than His Majesty&apos;s Government depend on availability of freight to remove wool from the Union.    The belief that freight for wool sold to outside purchasers would steadily become more difficult to obtain was one of the most important factors which determined producers to sell their wool to His Majesty1 s Government.     Ministers are not of course able to forecast shipping position (?which) may vary from day to day.    But the fact remains that recently a certain amount of tonnage has been avail-able for wool for America and Japan and that in theopen
open market abnormally high prices of wool have been and are at present well maintained.      Many of the producers who stood out of the Government scheme are consequently selling their wool today at prices considerably hi^ier than those paid by His Majesty1s Government for similar grades.      Open market prices for best types are from three to seven pence per pound higher than those paid for those types under the scheme.This state (?of the market) could not have been anticipated and it has placed Union Ministers and those who accepted offer of His Majesty1s Government on their advice in a very awkward position and has created not unnaturally a strong feeling of dis-satisfaction among those who have sold to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Ministers therefore venture to ask whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to release those producers of wool from their agreement who might now desire to be released, including owners of wool that has been appraised already as well as of wool still to be delivered and appraised.      Such release to be either for the whole wool clip regis-tered or for the portion of the wool registered which has not yet been appraised.   Wool already paid for not to be released until money paid has been re-funded to the Central Wool Committee.    This arrange-ment not to apply to wool which may be shipped before the decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government on Ministers suggestion is arrived at.Ministers are unable to estimate to what extent those who have sold to His Majesty&apos;s Government would if this were done wish to be released.    Some woulddesire
desire to be released but others probably would rather desire to adhere to the agreement, which secures them a definite cash price, than to face uncertainties of the market and the risk of failure of freights with inevitable fall in prices in con-sequence.Ministers see no other means of meeting diffi-culty which has arisen.    They much regret to have to make this request to His Majesty1 s Government.BUXTON.
250and[ should be Colonial OfficePARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received, Colonial Office 1.10 a.m.,7th January,1918).6St* W* W** *M W* MtvW^lMMWi WWWPersonal and Secret.Official minute telegraphed today has been drafted from point of view of publication and the best effect in public opinion here and to show that His Majesty&apos;s Government has been most considerate throughout.Position as regards freight is even worse than suggested in Minute.   There are a number of sailing vessels and steamers booked to load wool to Japan and America in the next two months and it is probable that during that period all wool available at the ports will be shipped.We suggest that the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government , should be something to the following effect.    Express regret that difficulties have arisen in connection with sale of wool under the agreement and say that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad, of all wool they can get for war purposes.    His Majesty&apos;s Government realise at the same time that while difficulty of providing freight to England remains as before more freigjit from Japan and America has been forthcoming and a greater demand than was anticipated has arisen for South African wool in these countries.   It is not possible to say how far these conditions may continue to prevail but the high prices which have unexpectedly prevailed are apparently at present enabling those who stood out of the Government scheme to obtain better prices than those who came in.    Although His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s original offer was, and still is, a fair one they are willing under the circumstances and at the request of Union Govern-ment to allow those who voluntarily came into the scheme to go out now if 1hey desire.Twohis Telegram Jg^the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government returned to the Offices of the War Cabinet for ^agsraissioj^to^tju^when done with unless required for official use.)
Two conditions must however obviously be laid down.1. That in each case the release must be for the i&amp;ole clip registered or for the portion of wool registered which has not yet been appraised.2.    That the decision to remain under the agreement or to take release must be given at once, say within fourteen days after publication of offer of release.I trust that we may receive decision of Eis Majesty&apos;s Government at a very early date. You will appreciate that the matter is most urgent.BUXTOH.

Officedone with unless required for official use.)PHRiSE TELEGRAM fromathe Governor General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received Colonial Office 8,35 p.m. 5th January 1918.)Secret and personal. On receipt of your secret and personal telegram of December 31st as to wool I telegraphed General Botha saying that it was very important I should see him. He therefore came up from his farm on Thursday. He sees no other way of getting out of a position which is fraught with Jgreat danger to the unity of his party and the life of his Government except the proposal that the Imperial&apos; Government should release from their agree-ment those who desire to be released.A (?) being impossible he decided to communicate with his colleagues by telegraph.   I have just heard from him that his colleagues all agree. He asks me to communicate privately with you to inform you that he is most grateful for your telegram and appreciates position and would (?he) greatly indebted to the Imperial Government if they could see their way to take this step.He will give me at once an official minute containing this, which I will telegraph.   In the meantime perhaps you would be kind enough to take any preliminary steps which may be necessary, as time is of great importance.Position is a most serious one and getting steadily worse, but General Botha confidently expects that this action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would retrieve the position.BUXTON.
