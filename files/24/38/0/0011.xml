VERY SECRET.General Headquarters,British Army in the Field, 3rd January, 1918. .Tho Chief of theImperial General Staff.In reply to &quot;Jar Office letter No. 12l/France/l493 (D.M.0) dated 28th December, 1917, I have the honour to forward the following report and Hem maps :1.      The existing systems of defence arc shown on map &apos;Al by single lines which mark the most forward trenches in each of them.The front system in the areas that have been some time in our possession, that is the portion from Hermies (9 miles east of Bapaume) to Hollebeke (4 miles S.E. of Ypres) is well organised and consists generally of front line, support line and reserve&quot;line,     the last being, as a rule, regarded as the main line of resistance.     Although referred to as &quot;lines&quot; these defences are not necessarily continuous trenches; in some places they may be a chain of posts with traffic trenches connecting them, in others a line of machine-guns disposed to cover a belt of ground by flanking fire.     Further, depth is given to the system throughout by disposing machine-guns and preparing localities outside the &quot;lines&quot;.   Plans CD, and E, show the defences typical of an old established sector of forward defences in detail - C - shows localities and communications and water supply; D and E - Machine-gun defences.The above portion of the defences, except the section Hermies to Bullecourt, may be regarded as fair to strong, and in this section the enemy is 1,000 yards away and the wire is especially good.
\ 5 3, -      - \ &apos;&quot;2. \I v \2.       In the portion of the front south of Hermies lies the ground recently taken over from the French, which has not yet been thoroughly investigated, and the battle ground of Cambrai. Here work and organisation is in progress and the defence should be strong when completed.     The present hard weather, is, however delaying the construction of defences seriously.In the portion of the front north of Holle.beke, from, this village to our left on the Corverbeek, which has not been long in our possession, the defences are not so far advanced as elsewhere.     The front line is formed by posts consisting of entrenchments supported by enemy concrete &quot;pill boxes&quot; converted to our use, and. the main line of resistance consists of defended localities arranged, in depth,3.       Behind the front system are the Corps and Army systems shown by lines on map &apos;A1.     Practically they are little more than lines consisting cither of continuous trenches, or a chain of posts or defended localities.     In places, however, between them, machine-gun emplacements and posts have been constructed anc localities prepared so as to give some depth of defence.,   lack of labour has prevented all that it was desired to do on these systems, particularly on the Army system, from being carried out, but the lines are wired and have machine-gun defences and are connected in places by switch lines which would serve to limit a break through.
4.       Generally speaking, all lines of defence are protected by continuous wire entanglements, these are being strengthened where necessary, as rapidly as labour and other conditions allow.     Front line wire varies much In condition; in many parts of the area it is difficult to maintain owing to incessant trench mortar fire; reliance has therefore been placed on the entanglements further in rear which are kept in good condition, notably along the reserve line.   Entanglements in all cases are sited in combination with the machine-gun defence*5)       The condition of the defences varies considerably and Is dependent on the labour available.   During active operations divisions on non-active fronts have to hold very long lines of defence,   Upkeep of back lines is therefore difficult; a redistribution of troops is now in progress and back defences are being renovated as labour becomes available.     In the ground recently captured from the enemy the defences are back-ward as compared to the old areas.     Labour has been concentra-ted on these,6.       In addition to the above system covering the front, there are still in existence certain old strategic lines, which, though not maintained., are however sufficiently well marked to be of value.   One of these, west of Arras, is an old Army line, and another extending from Sailly-sur-la-Lys northwards to Oostyleteren is an old G. H.Q.. line,   A third is known as the Canal line and runs from Bethune towards St, Omer, and a fourth, known as the B.C.D. line, covers Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk-These
These lines are indicated on the map.7. Concrete shelters are only necessary in parts of the wet areas; the difficulty of constructing them anywhere near the front under the eyes of an active enemy is considerable. In chalk country, and wherever the soil in the wet areas allowsftof it the necessary protection is therefore given by mined dug-outs.   Large numbers of these have been made and are still in progress.   An example of what is being done is given on map xBl which shows the area between Bullecourt and Lens.   Where these deep dug-outs cannot be made, e.g., In many parts of the newly captured ground east of Ypres, concrete shelters are being provided either by new work or by conversion of the German &quot;pill boxes&quot;.   South of Ypres, and notably between Armentieres and the Ypres - Bailleul road, and along back lines of defence as far as Bethune, there are many machine-gun emplacements built either of reinforced concrete or of double brick walls with concrete roofs.   Most of these can be considered proof against light artillery (up to 4.5&quot; Howitzer inclusive).8.     It should be noted that to make concrete shelters shell proof requires ten tons of material per man covered, and skilled men to erect them.     The expansion of our light railway and tram-way systems will, however, give greater facilities for getting up material for this work than has hitherto been possible, and men of various arms are being trained in concrete work to supplement the Royal Engineers.   Owing to the restrictions placed by the Ministry of Munitions on the supply of steel for engineerpurposes
purposes, there Is at present great difficulty in getting the steel rods required for reinforced concrete; it is hoped that this matter will be **adjusted.     Experience here tends to shew that 3r 6&quot; of reinforced concrete is equivalent as protection against shell fire to 5* 0&quot; of plain concrete, so that the economy in the weight of material that has to be carried up to the front if reinforcement is used, Is very considerable.9,       As regards protection for the artillery: cover for detachments is provided wherever possible by mined dug-outs; the guns themselves, in newly conquered area, are usually protected from observation by camouflage and from splinters by sandbag walls.     In the old areas the medium guns are usually covered by roofs made up of rails and rubble supported on timbers, and the field guns by corrugated steel shelters with earth, etc., over them.     Both of these methods are sufficient, as a rule, to give protection against 4,5&quot; howitzers and in many cases have with-stood heavier shells,     A few concrete gun pits have been made south of Bethune.     It may be added that two concrete factories have been established for dealing with concrete protection for men and guns and will shortly be in action.10.     I consider the communications as a whole adequate, butwestin the shell-swept heavy clay soil/of Passchendaele, they are difficult to maintain and cannot be protected; they here consist of light railways, trams, slab roads and &quot;duck walks&quot;.    In the old battle areas of the Somme and Arras, considerable work on the roads is still necessary.11o     A scheme of defence, a copy of which was handed to you and which is an elaboration of the existing systems, has been projected to meet the most recent conditions of the war.     It-consists of a front system comprising a &quot;forward&quot; zone, and a &quot;battle&quot; zone.     The battle zone has been designed to includeall
all ground which for various reasons should be held at all costs, and with a view to the main resistance being made, as far as poss-ible, on ground favourable to us.     The forward zone is designed to delay an attack in great f )rce so as to give time for bringing up reinforcements to the fighting zone as may be required,12.     Behind the front zones there will be a third or rear zone placed at such a distance in rear of the second as to compel the enemy to move forward his artillery and make fresh prepara-tions before he can attack it.     This zone should, when completed^ be a replica of the second.     Labour is, however, not available to carry on all these works at once, and experience shows that the upkeep of back line trerches as a whole is impracticable.   To meet the situation, therefore, some tactical localities have been or will be prepared for defence in the rearward zone, trenches will be marked out so that they can be easily dug when wanted, and continuous wire obstacles will be maintained along the whole line.     It is to be noted that this rear zone In part follows an existing line;   this ensures a large saving in the labour required for wiring.     This rear zone will form a defended area in which the larger reserves in the hands of Armies or G-.H.Q. can be concentrated.13a &apos;   In considering the relative strength or weakness of any particular defended area, it is necessary to take into consider-ation the facilities that the enemy has for attack and&apos; the whole organisation for its defences, e.g, artillery arrangements, means of observation, signal and other communications, garrisons of posts, movements of troops to meet the varying circumstances which may arise during an attack, supply of a &quot;-munition, stores,rations^
rations, water, etc.     This organisation, on the completeness of which a successful defence mainly depends, is worked out and recorded in brigade, divisional, corps and army defence schemes which are periodically reviewed and kept up to date.4(Sgd.)

No. O.AeD. 291/29, dated the 6th December, 1917, describing the policy to be pursued in the defensive organization of the British front, the following special instructions are issued as a guide to the manner of dealing with the Flesquieres and Passchendaele salientsvThese salients ,are unsuitabl^^ It is, Kowever,&quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;de&quot;sirable &quot;ToVeTain possession of them if they are not attacked in great force; and in the event nf attack in great force to use them to wear out and break up the enemy:s advancing troops as much as possible before these can reach our battle zone of defence which will be sited approximately as a chord across the base of each salient-In accordance with this policy the salients will be held firmly until the battle zcne of defence behind each has been prepared.        The defences of the salients will then be organized into advanced or &quot;outpost&quot; zones, arid as these defences become more complete, so,the garrisons can be reduced to what is required for the purpose in view,The. whole area in each salient should be organized defensively, in advance of the battle zone, with an intermediate system as well as a forward system of defence; the object being tc compel the enemy to fight for every yard of his advance up to the battle zone,For the defence of these salients, therefore, after the battle zone is ready for occupation, the ground should be held 3hiefly with machine-guns, supported by artillery, and aided with ample barbed wire obstacles skilfully placed and hidden.     Selected machine-gun companies might be detailed for the defence of stated sectors, and kept permanently (with reliefs) for a definite purpose.In the same way each sector should be under a specially chosen officer for preparation and defence.In certain few portions of the area counter-attacks will be possible.     These must be foreseen and arranged for.     At other points surprise counter-attacks with machine-gun fire will be possible.     All this requires a special garrison, and special leaders imbued with the offensive spirit even though forced to act on the defensive0(sgd.)   LcE. Kiggell,Gf.H.0,.

F3&quot;lc1.   GENERAL REMARKS .The general situation on the Russian and Italian fronts may enable the enemy to release a considerable number of effectives both as formed units and as reinforcements to the Western front.     At the same time the condition of our own man power and the paucity of reinforcements which we are likely to receive during the next few months will make it impossible for our units to be brought up to establishments.     In consequence the British Army in Prance will probably have to adopt a defensive attitude for some time to come and be prepared to meet a strong and sustained hostile offensive, adequately supported by artillery,At the same time we must consider the possibility of having to assume the offensive at some point, as the surest means of assisting either the French, should the weight of the enemyrs blow fall upon them, or some other portion of our own line,2.    PRINCIPLES OF DEFENCE.Energy and attention mast be directed at once to the additional measures to be taken to ensure an efficient defence under the conditions stated in para, 1. In organising defences regard must be had to(a) The active conduct of the defence, even againstgreatly superior numbers.The enemy?s fighting power must be impaired by local offensives (where the conditions are favourable) active patrolling, constant raids, organised bombardments and gas discharges.Plans and preparations for counter-attacks must bo included in the preparation of any defensive scheme c(b) Economy of troops (see para,5).(c) Organisation in depth,Every position must be organised in depth. This applies not only to the distribution of the infantry and machine guns, but also to the distribution of artillery and trench mortars.(d) The maintenance of confidence and fitness in thotroops is of vital importance.     Development of their fire power, cover from the enemy1s fire and care for the comfort and well-being of the men are important means to these ends,3.   ENEMYrS PROBABLE METHOD OF ATTACK.We must accept the possibility of a strong attack being delivered against any part of our line, supported by a large concentration of artillery, without more direct warning than the Intelligence Service may be able to give us regarding railway activity and a concentration of hostile forces in some area beyond cur front0     We must expect.an attack by masses of infantry, offering a very vulnerable target, but preceded by an intense bombardment which may he either of long or short duration according to whether the enemy aims at success by surprise or not.4.   GENERAL SCHEME OF DEFENCE,In considering the distribution of troops and the construction of defences, a careful study of the ground isnecessary
necessary with a view to the main resistance being made on ground favourable to us .-In accordance with this principle a battle zone has been selected in which to prepare to meet and repel any serious attacks on the part of the enemy.     The approximate limits of this battle zone are shewn on the accompanying map.       Where the battle zone does not coincide with our present front line system, the latter will be utilized as an outpost zone.The,, battle zone .The battle&quot; zone will be organised for defence in great depth., varying from 2,000 to at least 3,000 yards and will consist- of strong successive systems of defence,     Diagonal switch lines, supporting points and defended localities mist be constructed within the battle zone,, with a view to preventing the enemy from spreading outwards and rolling up the position, should he succeed in temporarily penetrating the defences The more importantlocalities in the cattle zone will be permanently garrisoned,       Plans and preparations for the employ-ment of troops both in the defensive battle and in counter-aitack must be carefully worked out.       Not only must the troops permanently allotted to the various sectors be considered in preparing schemes, . but also possible reinforcements arriving from elsewhere.The oat post zone.The outpost zone will also be organised for defence in depth and will be sufficiently garrisoned and strengthened to guard against surprise, to break up the enemy&apos;s attacks and compel him to expend larfe quantities of ammunition, and employ strong forces for Its capture.     The back-bone of the defence in this zone will be machine guns skilfully concealed in combination with wire entanglements.The re arward zOne.In addition to the battle and outpost zones of defence, a rear zone some 4-8 miles behind the battle zone will be selected and prepared for defence as labour becomes available.     Arrangements will be made by G.H.Q. in conjunction with Armies to have this defensive zone reconnoitred, and the projected defences spit-locked.5* TEE ECONOMY OF FORCE .The economy of troops must be studied In preparing positions and allotting troops to defences, in order that the strengths of the reserves, both tactical and strategical, may be as great as possible.      At the same time defences designed to secure valuable tactical features must be continuously and adequately garrisor.ec-..       The stronger and bettor sited the defences are, and the more impassable the&apos; obstacles, the fewer the men required to hold them and c0nsc.quent.l3r the larger reserves that can be held in hand.As the work on the defences progresses it should be possible gradually to. reduce the numbers allotted to the defence of the outpost zone, and thus increase the numbers available as reserves.
6.    EMPLOYMENT OF RESERVES.Until the battle zone has been strengthened there can be no alteration In existing, methods of defence.In describing the defensive policy to be pursued after the battle zone has been adequately prepared for defence, we must consider firstly the defensive action in the outpost zone, and secondly the defensive action in the battle zone.The troops allotted to the defence of the outpost zone will do all in their power to maintain their ground against every attack.     Garrisons of works and localities will hold their defences at all costs, and local reserves will counter-attack immediately, without waiting for orders, should the enemy succeed in penetrating the defences.Should the efforts of these troops fail to maintain or re-establish the line, it Is for the higher commander to decide whether he will employ any of his general reserves to regain the lost ground.Unless the enemy&apos;s attack is weak, and his lodgment on a narrow front, the value of the ground to be recaptured will seldom be rrorth the cost involved,The battle zone, being the ground, on which It has been decided to give battle should the enemy attack in .strength must be maintained.Should the enemy succeed In penetrating this zone, and the Immediate counter-attacks of local reserves fail to dislodge him, a deliberate counter-attack must be launched at the first possible moment.Unless the&apos; penetration is on a narrow front and only at,one place time will be necessary before a deliberate counter-attack is launched, in order that thorough prepara-tions may be made, including possibly the co-ordination of two or more attacks.The deliberate counter-attack should, when the enemy has expended his strength in the attack, not only aim at-re-establishing the battle zone; arrangements should also - be made to exploit the success, and inflict defeat upon himcInstructions regarding the number of divisions to be held in G..H.Q, Reserve, their dispositions,  and the arrangements for their concentration will be notified later.7..    ORGANISATION OF DEFENCE OF SECTORS.(a) It is essential, that the Corps sectors decided upon should be altered as seldom as possible.     In order to ensure continuity amongst succeeding Divisions, Corps Commanders should lay down in considerable detail the policy of work to be pursued In their respective sectors.(b) In organising each Corps sector for defence the possibility of having to increase the number of divisional -sectors at short notice owing to the arrival of reinforce-ments requires careful consideration.     Detailed arrange-ments for the re-distribution of the front under these circumstances must be worhed out.      The administrative arrangements in each Corps sector should also be framed so as to be able to deal with large reinforcements. In the event of a quiet sector of the front becoming the scene of a defensive battle.     Schemes should be worked out for providing areas in rear of the Corps sectors for the inlet of fresh divisions and the withdra-al of exhausted divisions 0
(c) The responsibility of Armies in co-ordinating Corps schemes of defence is not only to ensure the proper co-operation of fighting troops, but also to review all the administrative arrangements in connection with the arrival of reinforcements and the rapid concentration of troops .(d) The distribution and allotment of labour requires careful co-ordination.     The more important sectors must receive first consideration.       The constant review of the labour situation, both by Corps and by Armies, is essential in order .to ensure that the claims of the various branches employing labour are given due consideration, and to prevent over-lapping and waste.The employment of labour for purposes that do not contribute to fighting ends must be continually guarded against.In view of the necessity for completing the defences in the battle zone as early as possible, it may be necessary to transfer labour from less important work and also to employ fighting troops on this work while in reserve *CONSTRUCTION OF DEFENCES.(a) In the construction of defences the order of priority of work will be :-(i)   Wire.(ii)    Shell-proof accommodation, including&apos; machine gun emplacements, observation posts and battle headquarters. (iii)   Communications, including roads, tracks and c ommun 1 c a t i on t re nc he s *(iv)   Earthworks. -In the construction of rear defences in the battle zone it will frequently suffice in places of minor importance to spit-lock the actual fire trenches in the first instance, using all available labour on more important localities.(b) One of the essential considerations in the selection of positions for defence within the battle zone is the relative advantages for the action of our own and the enemy&apos;s artillery and the possibilities for good communication.     Good ground observation and covered positions for the artillery at favourable ranges should always be looked for, and conversely every endeavour should be made to render the position of the enemy in these respects as unfavourable as possible.       The less the communications in rear of a defensive position are over-looked by the enemy, the easier will it be to maintain the troops engaged in its defence.(c) The constant improvement of the road, railwayand trench tramway systems for carrying material, ammunition and supplies Is of great importance in the construction of positions.       A gcod tramway system is of particular-importance where it is intended to undertake concrete work.(d) In the construction of defences a careful planning of work, and the suitable distribution of the available labour and material are the chief means of securing good results.   Comprehensive plans, covering a considerable period ahead, should be drawn up, and should not be departed from, otherwise waste and delay e,ve inevitable.
5*65In order further to ensure continuity of work, pfficers should be placed permanently in charge of definite sectors of the battle zone.(e) Particular attention should be paid to adapting defences to the ground so that they may be&apos; as invisible as possible from air and ground observation.   In this connection wire entanglements in numerous belts with spaces between are more difficult to destroy by artillery fire than the old typ&amp; of single thick entanglement;.     The former are also much less visible from the air.     The camouflaging of defences as they are constructed should receive attention0(f) There is much scope for the ingenuity in designing obstacles and selecting sites for machine guns etc     Every-thing tending to take the enemy by surprise is of especial value *9.     ARTILLERY.&apos; Army defence schemes should embrace an organisation in depth for their artillery, as for other means of defencee   This applies both to the siting of batteries for defence of the front system and to the preparation or, at least, selection of battery positions to cover retirement to and the defence of rearward lines *The offensive principle of siting all batteries as far forward as possible is evidently not always equally applicable to a defensive object, though a few guns well forward for special objects may be of great value.The question of defilade must always be borne in mind; Commanders must ensure that the majority of their 18-pdr, batteries are able to bring fire to bear well this side of our front line against an enemy breaking through it*Positions for reinforcing artillery, called Up within the Army or sent from outside sources must be definitely selected and marked in every Corps area for each line of defence.      The system of silent batteries or sections, alternative positions, &quot;dummy&apos;1 batteries and roving sections or single guns, so freely adapted by the enemy needs to be exploited in the defence as far as the1 ground and oommunica-tions allowiObservation posts for all additional positions must be selected and marked, and the routes into them must be made known to all concerned so that no confusion shall arise in case it becomes necessary to occupy them?.The action and movement of batteries, particularly field batteries in support of counter-attacks must be cons id-. ered as far as possible in advance and arrangements made to have an adequate number of batteries ready to move at the shortest notice for this purposejCamouflage for the concealment of battery positions including approaches, should be exploited to the full.All battery positions within 3,000 yards or so of the front line should be wired all round:Attention is called to 0JU337, dated 14th January, 1917, in which the principles of artillery action in counter-preparation are laid down.10,    MACHINE GUNS,The machine gun defence in each sector must form part of the framework of the whole infantry defensive organisation.Machine guns should be distributed in depth and sited for flanking fire so as to form impassable belts of fire, and by breaking up any enemy attack to prepare the way for the c ounter-attack.Concealment of machine gun positions must be one of the first considerations;     for this it will frequently be advisable to site them in low-lying, well hidden places, provided the field Of fire obtainable is satisfactory.Ample
Ample wire obstacles should be constructed in conjunction with the machine gun defence of the zone. In principle, the siting of these obstacles should depend on the positions selected for the machine guns and not vice versa.Machine guns distributed in depth in the defensive zones should be capable of supporting the troops holding the more forward defences by direct or indirect long range fire.11.     VIGILANCE AND INFORMATION.The necessity of obtaining the earliest possible information regarding the enemy1s dispositions and intentions demands constant vigilance.   Not only must patrolling and raiding be actively carried out, but every opportunity must be seized for ground and air cbservation. Information gained must be passed back to the higher formations without delay.   It is the higher formations and more especially G.E.Q. which have the means of attaching the proper significance to the information gained and of gauging its importance.12.      TRAINING.-(a) Troops should be trained in open warfare and the spirit of the counter-offensive inculcated.Frequent practice in musketry and field firing is essential, so that the infantry may develop confidence in their power to stop the enemy by rifle, lewis and machine gun fire,  even without the help of an artillery barrage.(b) Frequent practice of counter-attacks by reserves, large and small, should be carried out.   The form of these attacks should be laid down in the defence schemes of formations and units, and practised on the ground for which they are planned,j. (c) It should constantly be explained to theI troops during training that the assumption of the offen-I sive by the enemy would be the best possible opportunity I  of inflicting over-whelming loss on him and still further I   establishing our superiority in-preparation for the *   renewal of our advance.13.    GERMAN INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEFENCE.Particular attention is called to S.S.561 and S.S.621, the translations of the German documents &quot;The principles of command in the defensive battle in position warfare&quot; dated 1st March, 1917, and &quot;General principles of the construction of field positions&quot; 3rd Edition, dated 15th August, 1917cIn these documents the enemy has embodied the lessons of two years&apos;  experience in defence and the principles laid down by him are thoroughly sound and should be carefully studied.(Sd.)
