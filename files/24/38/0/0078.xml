^    SUlCiARV QF REPORT No, 24- OF NOVEn3ERn50TH, FkOMGENERAL BERTHELOT.(T translation of paper communicated by French Ge: -eral Staff)&quot;INTELLIGENCE CONCERNING THE. ENEMY&quot;.The enemy does not display any Inclination for an offen-sive, but works at his fortifications and shelters.     Some German divisions have been relieved by the extension of the front of adjoining Austrian divisions.     It is not known what -;  has become of them.ROUMANIAN TROOPS.In consequence of the state of affairs in the Russian armies, the plans for a restricted offensive have had to be abandoned, and the Roumanian High Command is primarily occup-ied with considering the measures to be adopted in the event of the Russians taking the step of leaving their positions.The moral of the Roumanian troops remains unaffected; all the attempts at fraternisation on the part of the enemy have been rejected,     Unfortunately material conditions do not improve, and supplies are still insufficient,RUSSIAN TROOPS.The situation has not changed from the military point of view, but moral grows worse every day.   The defensive organ-ization Is good, the preparations for the winter are sufficient, supplies are assured, which induces the troops to remain at their posts for the moment; but they no longer have any sense of discipline or of duty..     In the 6th Army - the worst - the Soldiers&apos; Committees exercise undisputed rule, and General Zurikoff, the Array Commander-., is their humble servant.   The 4th, 8th, and 9th Armies,, whioh have resisted better up to now, show evident signs of disorganisation, .and fraternisation, which has become more and more frequent, takes the form of the discussion^ of propositions for an armistice.     These Armies, are, as they have always been, subject to an intense German-Bolshevik propag-anda, which, under a variety si forms, only tends to a single end, - to disorganize -one units by the abolition of all author-ity and to root in the soldiers&apos; mind this single idea, peace and land.     It is very difficult to stop this propaganda which is tolerated by the military authorities and treated with favour by the Government,     General Berthelot has detached a certain num-ber of officers from the Mission and sent them among the Russian Armies to carry on counter-propaganda, and, for the moment, by means of the regular supply of provisions, the effort kept up is just sufficient to get the troops to remain at their posts.POLITICAL SITUATION IN ROUMANIA.Theoretically the Roumanian Government always remains Te-solved to struggle to the end with the Allies, and this resol-ution might well force the Roumanian Army to fall back into Russia,       But such an operation would be a delicate one, parti-c-ularly in winter,, for In the whole of Southern Russia there are tnly unmetalled roads often impassable for vehicles and no depots of provisions and wood have been established.     Further, the Roumanian Army would have to pass through disbanded and pillaging Russian troops and armed conflict must be the result. General Berthelot oonsiders that during thisretreat moral would remain good en the whole, for the idea is rooted more and more in the minds of all that whatever be the decision ultimately taken by Roumania it is in every
. 1313intac tway her interest to preserve/a sound and numerous army.     He therefore insists on the demand already made for credits with a view to forming depots of provisions on the r oute s of Be s s arah ia .POLITICAL SITUATION IN RUSSIA.Events have led General Berthelot to extend his action ;.n the regions of Russia adjacent to Roumania, which, to speak truly, form the rear zone of the latter country.   His efforts have been concentrated on the transport of material ??hich is in passage through Russia and on the replenishment of supplies.     The.results have been satisfactory, thanks to the officers, both combatant and non-combatant, told off for this purpose, and his economic agents have in addition kept him in touch with all political events.   By force of circumstances he has bean led to act partly in place of General Niessel as regards action in the South, and he thinks that the Roumanian Mission ought more and more to pay attention in this direction, since Southern Russia tends to separate from Northern Russia and is itself &quot;becoming sub-divided into three principal groups       Ukraine. Don, and Caucasus.UKRAINE.The movement is led by the Ukrainian intellectuals who rely for support on the workers in the towns and the soldiers, .   .through the intermediary channel of the Soviets.     The local Government plainly affirms its Federalist ideas, but it is under the necessity of struggling against a formidable Germano-Bolshevik propaganda, of which the Jews are the most active agents.   However, this propaganda is met by a strong anti-Austrian current and the moment would appear to be favourable for French action calculated to raise the national sentiment of the Ukraine with a view to the continuation of the war.     The greatest difficulty consists in the reassembl-ing and. re-organisation of the Ukrainian troops dispersed alung the whole of the Russian front.General Berthelot has accordingly sent to Kiev a French /liesion which will get into touch, with the Ukrainian author-it ies under the pretext of replenishing supplies for the Roumanian front.The basin of the Don is, like the Ukraine, a very rich region from the agricultural and. industrial point of view, and further, the largest mining centre in Russia. &apos;   The Cossacks are its masters and as they received from the old administration important privileges concerning the possession of land they have resisted, the Maximalist propaganda and are partisans of any Government maintaining order, whichever it nay be.   As in the case of the Ukraine the Cossack units -are actually scattered ever the whole Russian front, and In the Caucasus, and their concentration would take a very long time.   Further, it is not known what are their inten-tions or their sentiments with regard to the Allies and to what extent Ealedin can be counted on.     However. General Berthelot considers that some effort should be.-made in this direction and he is going to send to Kaled.in&apos;s neighbourhood a Mission analagous to that which he has sent to Kiev.f*J\ &quot;t.-1    ottoGeneral Berthelot has not yet any of the elements nec-essary for the appreciation of the situation in this district, but he is disposed to send officers there also.
CREDITS.It is a necessity to open large credits in order to be able to influence the newspapers and the Committees, paid to have suitable representatives.   Up to now, for want of funds., the French have been at a disadvantage, while the Germans., who spend money without counting the cost, have owed the success of their propaganda to this lavishness.INTERVENTION OF JAPANESE AND AMERICAN TROOPStThis would only present advantages in the way of re-establishing order and serving&apos; as a base for the future re-grouping of the healthy forces in Russia.    Fart of these troops might relieve the Russian forces- on the Roumanian front, the remaining part being employed to police the large towns and the railways .CONCLUSIONS.Anarachy is complete in Russia, and It is impossible to foresee anything, but as the Roumanian Mission has resources in personnel much greater than those at Petrograd, General Berthelot is going to undertake the work of re-organisation and to employ all his forces in Southern Russia, with which * he is in constant and easy relations.   With this end It is indispensable that he should be allotted important credits, the expense of a few millions being nothing beside the material and moral loss which the complete overwhelming of Russia would cause to France and the Allies.
