G.T,3g59A,This Documant is the Property of His Britannic Majesty1^ Government.War cabiist. &apos;MM Slip? J?QR C.0\7AHDIGIh Memorandum by the l;Li^^lr..A^^A?A?Ji?o. il&amp;^AlThis matter has given me very serious concern and I feel afraid that the \7ar Cabinet did not explore all that their decision involved.Por instance the decision not to notify the real causa of death is to ,my mind more cruel than kind.    In working class homes the family on a death taking place in too many cases make real sacrifices to have an imposing funeral -md in too many instances get into debt.I em real 13^ afraid that the decision above referred to will result in - elaborate In Memorium Cards containing tho deceased&apos;s pSoto-^raph, and some verse of poetry as to a hero!s death, and the purchase of expensive mourning-, whereas tho truth cannot be hidden except for a few weeks, just time for one of his mates writing home saying &quot;I was vory sorry for poor X who was shot for cowardice&quot;.   What a double catastrophe for the widow and family.   The evil is greater than the or-iginal intimation.Another contingency arises, if the first did not^ when application is made for pension,&apos;   How is this Kinistry to explain why a compassionate allowance only is paid instead of a pension?   The truth is either told or an evasive reply loading up to continued demands for definite reply.&apos;A
A further consideration arises if compassionate grants ara made in such cases - can payment he avoided ina. Careless tampering with derelict bombs or grenades.b. Wounds or death when cleaning rifles, andc. All other cases arising from serious and wilfulnegligence or disobedience of orders.It appears to me. therefore, that there is no halfway house.   We must either revert to the previous procedure, or all cases of death or disablement must be dealt with on compassionate lines.
