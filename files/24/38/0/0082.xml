MINISTRY OF SHIPPING ITALIAN. GOALThe Ministry of Shipping is, and has been throughout, fully conscious of tho extreme seriousness of the Italian coal position-. The facts of this situation have been repeatedly placed before the Far Cabinet and the Ministry has constantly endeavoured to give Italy the maximum possible assistance in tonnage.  . It is, of course, recognised that in spite of these efforts we have not succeeded in satisfying Italyfs minimum requirements, and it must be borne in mind that one of the chief difficulties in the way of increasing the supply of coal to Italy is the. exceedingly high degree of risk from submarine attack to which vessels entering the Mediterranean are exposed.    A proposal was recently submitted to the War Cabinet to divert a number of Eastern-bound liners to carry coal.to the Mediterranean subject to adequate naval protection being afforded.!   as it was not found possible to supply the necessary protection, this proposal had to be abandoned..The immediate position is as follows.-The total quantity of coal shipped from the-United Kingdom to Italy during December was about 436,000 tons, of which approximately 363,000 tons were carried in British vessels..This figure is in excess of the outside monthly quantity which we have ever indicated that we could provide, and it has only been reached as the result of a very special effort which cannot be * maintained during succeeding months.    As regards January, it is understood that the Italians expect to ship about 113,000 tons of coal in vessels under their own control.   The tonnage which can be supplied by the Ministry of Shipping is not expected to suffice for much more than 150.000 or at the 3-e&amp;s4 200,000 tons.The
The provision of coal to Italy can only be effected at tho expense of cereals,&apos;and in view of the recent international agreement It is necessary to regard requirements for foodstuffs as a first charge upon tonnage.   Italy herself acquiesces .in the principle of giving priority to cereals, and her present coal crisis is largely owing to the fact that she recently diverted a block of neutral and Italian tonnage under her control from coal service to the carriage of wheat. -   Ve are at the present moment seriously short of the tonnage required to carry out the &quot;fheat Executives cereals programme for January and February loading; as against 700,000 tons of cereals shipped in British vessels during December it is desired to ship from North America 1,100,000 tons in January and 1,700,000 tons from Vforth America and the Plate in February, Drastic rearrangements of the liner programmes have failed to meet this deficiency, and the shortage will be increased if any attempjr. is made to augment the shipment of coals to Italy, or even to keep it up to the December level.     It should be noted that towards these huge figures our Allies can only contribute about 350,000 tons a month.   The only practicable and effective means of placing the supply of coal to Italy on a satisfactory footing is by enlisting the assistance of France.   It is beyond question clear that,   if the principle of equality of sacrifice is to be applied, the one Allied service which can properly be drawn upon to relieve the present Italian situation is the French coal trade.   As a result of the increase which has taken place during the last twelve months in (a) the amount of tonnage carrying coal from the i-nited Kingdom to France and (b) the output of the French coal-mines, Francers present position as regards coal is comparatively favourable, and it is of the highest importance that she should agree at an ,early date to take upon herself some share of the Italian shortage.     It is not a question of diverting to Italy&quot; vessels which are now employed incarrying
carrying coal to Prance, for the small vessels which are suitable for cross-channel work could not be used for the longer voyages to Italy.     The only solution of the present difficulty is that Prance should at once make arrangements to keep Italy regularly supplied with a substantial quantity of coal sent direct from her own mines in the South and that she should do this without any stipulation as to replacement from the United Kingdom.To sum up:-(1)    The shipments of coal from the United Kingdom to Italy could only be increased (or, indeed, kept up to the present standard) by doing serious injury to the Allied cereal programmes, which have been framed on a basis of minimum requirements and, by virtue of International agreements, have a priority over coal. As indicated above, the amount of coal which will be shinned to &apos; Italy this-month (January) will fee about 300;000*tons.(2)    In these circumstances, the Italian coal crisis can only be relieved if France, which is relatively well supplied with coal, will consent to allocate a substantial quantity of her own coal to Italy without replacement from the United&quot;Kingdom.(sd)   J. P. Ilaclayx This is in addition to the coal supplied by Prance from French mines (of which at least 150,000 tons has been asked and provisionally agreed, subject to certain difficulties with which the Ship-ping Controller is now dealing personally in Paris) and to any quantity the Italian Government may be obtaining from America.8th January 1918.
