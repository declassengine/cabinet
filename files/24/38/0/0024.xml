SECRET.MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.ZMfflll)--- ; -B4wLLjJ^^eport for Week ending Wednesday, January 2, 1918.PART I. ACTION  TAKEN.On Saturday, December 29th, a special conference of the Trade Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the Workers (War Emergency&quot; Committee, was held in the Central Hall, Westminster, to protest against the unnecessary suffering caused to the masses by the prolonged delay of the Government in organising an equitable distribu-tion of the supplies of food, and to demand (J) the equal sharing among all classes of the necessaries of life, (2) the introduction of compulsory rationing, on the basis of registered orders, for a large number of foods, and (3) an organised public supply of milk as a measure, not of poor relief, but of public health. Over 800 delegates were present and the meeting was addressed by Mr. R. Smillie, Dr. Marion Phillips, Mr. W. C. Anderson, M.P., and Messrs. McGure, Hyndman and Lansbury.Mr. Clynes explained what had been done in order to secure effective control of supplies and prices and pointed out that the methods of solving the problem of distribution indicated in the proposals before the conference were precisely those in process of adoption by the Ministry of Food. The scheme of rationing in contemplation would endeavour to secure that essential foods were distributed first and foremost in the national interest to essential workers, and not according to the purchasing power of wealthy individuals. It was the intention of the Food Controller to invite the assistance of Labour men in extending and stimulating the efforts of the department. He expressed his sympathy with the resolution affecting the supply of milk.The conference passed promptly to the specific votes, and appeared to be satisfied with Mr. Clynes&apos; statement of policy.On Monday, December 31, Lord Rhondda issued a memorandum on local schemes of food distribution for the guidance of local food control committees in the prepara-tion of measures for the prevention of queues. The chief recommendations may be summarised as follows :  1   &apos;.   -&apos; &quot;.Every customer should be registered with one shop for the purchase of aparticular foodstuff, and not allowed to buy it elsewhere. The shopkeeper should be required to divide his weekly supplies in fair propor-tion among all the customers registered with, him. No shopkeeper should be allowed to register more customers than he can con-veniently serve.The supplies of any particular article from time to time available in a district should be distributed among the retailers in that district in proportion to the number of customers registered with them, and a limit fixed to the quantity of the article which any particular class of customer may obtain.- -Committees whose areas form one district for the purpose of food distribution should act in close consultation in any scheme which they prepare. :Committees should deal only with butter, margarine, and tea until further experience has been gained.Customers should be given free choice of a registered retailer, but encouraged to register at the shop where they usually buy their supplies.Butter and tea retailers should be registered. An Order&apos; has already been made making compulsory the registration of retailers of margarine.In case of a shortage of supplies committees should reduce temporarily the individual allowance in their district, and report to their Food Commissioners details as to the supplies and the authorised demands made on the retailers.For the present the maximum weekly allowance to the individual should not exceed : - Margarine or butter       -        -      - -        - 4 oz.Tea        -        -        -&quot;       -        -        - -    1\ oz.Distribution should be regulated by cards containing spaces to be marked up .......   each week, as the holder purchases supplies.....a.

The Food Controller, in.consultation with the three Departments of Agriculture, has fixed the following bate prices under.the.Potatoes Order No. 2, 1917, for sound, ware potatoes delivered by the grower during the;month of January, 1918 :  (1) All counties in England and Wales except Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdon, bl. per ton.(2) Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdon :  (a) For potatoes grown on silt lands, marsh lands, warp lands, or limestone lands : -   I. King Edward potatoes, 61. per ton. II. Other varieties, bl. 10s. per ton.(b) For potatoes grown on other lands :  I. King Edwards, bl. 10s. per ton. II. Other varieties, bl. per ton.(3) Scotland :  (a) Dumbartonshire, Stirlingshire, Linlithgowshire, Edinburgh, Haddington, and ail counties south thereof, bl. per ton.(6) Argyllshire, Perthshire, Forfarshire,&apos; Fife, Kincardineshire, Clackmannan, and Kinross, 4/.. 15s. per ton.(c) The rest of Scotland, 4L 5s. per ton. (4) Ireland il. per ton.In order to secure the largest possible acreage under potatoes in 1918, the Food Controller, in consultation with the three Departments of Agriculture, has issued the following announcement: With a view to encouraging the maintenance of the 1917 acreage under potatoes and the breaking up of further areas of grass land, the Food Controller will be prepared to enter into contracts with farmers for the delivery (as and when required) of approved varieties of main crop potatoes on the following special terms :-Time for Delivery.England and Wales.Scotland.November 1, 1918, to January 31, 1919 February 1, 1919, to March 31, 1919 -May 1, 1919, to end of season   -61.f.o.r.

(or l&apos;.o.b.)The above terms will apply only to sound ware potatoes grown on acreage in excess of the total acreage under potatoes on the same farm or holding in 1916, and will be subject to the following special conditions :  (a) The total acreage under potatoes on the farm or holding in question must notbe less in 1918 than in 1917 ;(b) Any directions issued by the Board of Agriculture regarding spraying,harvesting, and pitting must be duly carried out;(c) Applications for contract forms must be made not earlier than February 1,1918, and not later than May 1, 1918, and should be addressed to the Director of Vegetable Supplies, 18, Upper Grosvenor Streetj London, Vi &apos;      W.l.    . .     . -As from November 1, 1918, the Food Controller will purchase the entire crop of Great Britain with the exception of-(a) potatoes grown on holdings including less than one statute acre of potatoes ;(b) potatoes grown for the grower&apos;s consumption, or tor consumption on thegrower&apos;s farm ;(c) potatoes grown for experimental purposes.The purchase price will be eventually assessed with due regard to the size of the crop and to the quality of the potatoes, but for sound ware will be in any case not less than the f.o.r. (or f.o.b.) prices indicated in the following scale :-Time for Delivery.

The prices for seed and undersized potatoes will be announced &quot;in due course,&apos;but every grower will have the right to retain any seed he may require for his own use.Delivery in both cases is to be made as and when required, and price, weight, and condition are to be determined in accordance with:the scales set put above as at the date when delivery is taken. Subject to proper precaution haying been taken, the Food Controller will bear the risk of damage other than normal wastage.The Food Controller as at present advised does not propose to take over or fix prices for the 1918 crop before November 1. If, however, for special reasons-for example, a partial failure of the crop or general shortage of foodstuffs-it becomes necessary in the national interest to fix any maximum prices, such maximum prices will not be less than those indicated below :  Julv 1 to 15       -      - -      -      -   14 per ton.July 16 to 23     -     -----      -   12 per ton.July 24 to 31 -     -   10 per ton.August      -     -      -      -      -     -      -    8 per ton.September to October -     -     -     -     -    7 per ton.A separate announcement will be made at a later date as to the Irish crop. The differential treatment given to Scottish potatoes reflects the desire of the Food Controller to relieve transport difficulties by putting the highest premium on the potatoes grown nearest to the,principal consuming areas.- i     Control of Supplies and Prices.:Bacon, Hams and Ldrd.-The Treasury has not accepted the Food Controller^ view that the Canadian Packers should be compensated for their, losses incurred-by continuihg to ship their goods after the maximum, importers&apos; prices had been fixed. At the time when the policy of fixing these maximum prices was adopted the Canadian Packers, after an, interview at this Ministry, had the impression that the continuance of imports from Canada was desired, and that a price would be: allowed for such imports which would show the Packer a profit. This Ministry is approaching the Treasury again, with the request that the Treasury may reconsider its view.Interviews have been held with representatives of the wholesale trade to consider &apos; such an amendment of the Bacon, Ham. and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, .1917, as . will enable bacon to reach all retailers at a uniform rate.Cereals. The operation of the Oats Products (Retail Prices) Order was postponed until December 31 under the Oats Products (Postponement of Date) Order. The prices laid down in the original Order will come into force on December 31, but the prices fixed therein for Scotland and the counties of Northumberland, Durhamfi Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire. Yorkshire, and Cheshire will on and after December 31 only apply- to Scotland, while the above-named counties will come under the prices scheduled for &quot; all other parts of the United Kingdom.&quot;Dried Fruits and Miscellaneous Foods.-hi view of the decision of the Cabinet on the subject of priority of tonnage for essential foodstuffs no purchases of dried fruits have been made. Instructions have been sent to Mr. Burlumi cancelling the authority to purchase 5,000 tons of currants, which were cabled to him on December 11th, and as Mr. Burlumi reported in a letter dated December 15th that he had decided to put off purchasing any quantity of the second 5,000 tons for at least ten days, it is probable that very little, if any, currants have been purchased on the authority given on December 11th.Conferences have been held with Captain Williams, the Army Service. Corps&apos; representative in Spain, and as a result of these conferences it has been decided, to take no action on the Spanish Commercial Agreement. The Foreign Office have been consulted, and agree with this decision.The Returns under the Coffee (Returns) Order, 1917, are coming in, and ,th&apos;e Advisory Committee has been summoned to review the situation in the light of these Returns.A Cocoa Advisory Committee is in course of formation and it is hoped to hold the first meeting next week.    In the meantime, the Returns of the output of manufacturers of plant are nearly complete, and it should be possible to ascertain, the Committee&apos;s views as to the capacity of the plant to provide sufficient-cocoa, powder for the use of consumers in the United Kingdom. ; , -
&quot;       Feeding Stuffs. By; the Cattle Feeding Stuffs (Committees) Order, 1917, the &apos; Food Controller has set up four-Fort Feeding Stuffs Committees for England at the Ports of London, Liverpool; Hull, and Bristol, and one Port Feeding Stuffs Committee for Scotland at Glasgow, and also 28 Provincial Feeding Stnffs Committees for England and Wales, and seven Provincial Feeding Stuffs Committees for Scotland.These Committees have been called into being for the purpose of facilitating the distribution and allocation of Cattle Feeding Stuffs, and it is intended that licenses for trading in Cattle Feeding Stuffs shall be obtained through these Committees, as regards first-hand seller and wholesale dealers, through the Port Committees, and, as regards distributing dealers, through the Provincial Committees.The Port Committees are to consist of either four or eight members representing equally the interests of importers, seed crushers, flour millers, and distributing-dealers, with any additional members whom the Food Controller may think fit toappoint. ;     &quot;...Ilie Provincial Committees are to consist of six distributing dealers, four farmer members, and an ex-officio member, and such other members as the Food Controller may appoint. The ex-officio member is the Live Stock Commissioner for the area in which the Committee&apos;s area is situate or some person nominated by him. In the majority of cases the Live Stock Commissioner has nominated his sub-commissioner as the ex-officio member.;The powers and duties of both the Port and Provincial Committees are to be those which may be assigned to them from time to time by the Food Controller, and it is intended that considerable duties will be entrusted to these Committees with reference to a scheme of rationing of cattle feeding stuffs which it is hoped shortly to introduce.Intoxicating Liquor. The Government having-decided to allow the brewing during the quarter commencing 1st January 1918 of an additional barrelage similar -in amount to the additional quantity allowed to be brevred in the past quarter, an Order entitled the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, No. 5, 1917, has been made by the Food Controller, laying down the conditions under which the brewing is allowed.The conditions are identical with those prescribed by the Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, No. 3, 1917, under which the brewing of the additional quantity has been allowed for the quarter ending 31st December 1917.Margarine. A scheme for controlling and distributing the output of margarine is in preparation, and will be completed shortly.Meat. The question of meat supplies and distribution is very serious at present. The scheme drawn up by this Department after consultation with the Central Advisory Committee on Live Stock and Meat Supplies, and with other representatives of farmers, auctioneers, wholesale and retail butchers throughout the country, cannot be put in operation until the middle of the month; in the meanwhile, emergency measures have been taken, but since the Cattle Sales Order came into force on December 27th, 1917, very few cattle have come into the markets, and the shortage :is acute.   Hundreds of telegrams are being received from all over.the country stating -that no bullocks, or only a number lamentably below requirements, are available ; especially great difficulty is being experienced in meeting the requirements of canteens in munition areas, and of public institutions such as hospitals.   The shortage has been partially met in a few cases by issuing supplies of frozen meat, but the stocks available for this purpose are quite inadequate to remedy permanently the deficiency all over the country.   Powers are being given to the Area Live Stock Commissioners to requisition cattle, but they will be used as sparingly as possible.&apos;Milk. The Food Controller has this week issued a memorandum to all Food Control Committees, directing them to put into operation, not later than January 21st, 1919, a scheme for providing priority.in distribution of milk to children, invalids, and those for whom it .is a medical necessity. Unless the Food Controller sanctions Committees&apos; own proposals, they will adopt a scheme which provides for a supply not exceeding LI-pints daily to infants under. 18 months old, and 1 pint daily to children between 1-^ and 5 years old. Invalids and others will be supplied according to the quantities prescribed for them by doctors.Should a Committee decide by resolution that no milk priority scheme is necessary in its area, such a resolution must be approved by the Food Controller. The Food Controller has made the Ice Cream (Restriction) Order, dated - December
a   1763-1B..29th, 1917., which requires that no person shall, after the 1st January 1918, make for sale/sell, or offer or expose for sale, or buy. or offer to buy, any Ice Padding, Ice Cream, or Water Ice, or any article in the making of which any ice cream, or water ice or ice pudding has been used.Oils and Fats.-A scheme has been completed and the necessary instructions given to refiners, whereby every manufacturer - of margarine will be supplied as froni next week with an amount of refined oils sufficient to maintain his maximum output of margarine week by week. It is hoped very shortly to complete similar schemes to apply to the fish frying and edible compound fat trades.Sugar. In the report for week ending December 19 the total quantity of sugar required for Great Britain aud Ireland during 1918 was stated to be estimated at 807,106 tons. That figure was merely the estimated total indent on the voucher system as obtained from the local food committees, and was not intended to include navy and army requirements, or the excess quantities needed for the manufacture of jam, golden syrup, or condensed milk. Nor did it take into account wastage incurred through refining, or loss anticipated through enemy action. These additional items represent requirements amounting to 610,000 tons.Tea.-A meeting has been held with the wharfingers for further discussion of the rates for handling Government tea, and with the first-hand brokers on the rate of their commission.   It is anticipated that a saving in charges is likely to result.By the Tea (Provisional Prices) Order (No. 2) 1917, a new scale of prices came into force on the 31st December 1917.Transport and Cold Storage. Treasury sanction has been obtained for loans to the amount of 716,000J. to public authorities and private firms for the purpose of providing additional cold storage space at various ports in this country, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled. Sanction has also been obtained for the expenditure of 75,000 . for the provision of cold storage facilities at Devonport, subject to certain arrangements being concluded with the Admiralty.Local Authorities.Food Control Committees. A number of cases have recently been reported in which members of Committees, who are traders, have been prosecuted for contravening the Food Controllers Orders. An Order is now in preparation which will disqualify from membership of a Food Control Committee any person who has been convicted of an offence against the Food Controllers Orders.Distribution. Reports from Food Commissioners on the whole show a diminution of the queue trouble, but several point out that the measures taken to ensure-an improvement in distribution will result in temporary relief only. Special stress is laid upon the necessity for a sound scheme for general distribution throughout the country followed by a compulsory general rationing scheme. It is anticipated that the putting into force of a number of local rationing schemes (while allowing other areas to remain outside them) will be a cause of serious discontent and trouble.Complaints of meat shortage have been received from several quarters, and meat queues are anticipated.The high prices charged for fish and vegetables, and the consequent large profits made by retailers of these commodities, is a source of discontent.The short supply of beer is a cause of trouble among munition workers in the Northern Division.. An analysis and comparison- of sugar card returns, which gives the difference between the number of cards issued and those deposited with retailers in the various Food Control Committees&apos; areas, shows a marked difference between these two sets of figures. - The total result shows a gravitation towards larger centres for buying purposes. This, as might be expected, is most marked in rural districts near large towns where, in some cases, it is found that as many as half the cards issued in rural areas are deposited elsewhere. It might be rash, however, to assume that this result must necessarily be a guide to distribution when other commodities are about to be rationed.
,k- PART IT-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION,   . :With the end of the year it is natural to attempt some estimate between the food position as it was on September 1st, the beginning of the cereal year, and that which exists at the present time. The former Was sketched in an earlier report (Report for 1 the week ended September 19th). There the favourable position of the stocks was commented on and tables were given which showed how little the numbers of live stock, with the exception of pigs, had been impaired by the- circumstances and consumption of the previous 12 months.The four months which have elapsed: have witnessed a considerable change in &apos; both respects.The comparatively heavy stocks, which had been built up or maintained have under-gone considerable wastage. If we compare the cereal year 1916-17 with 1917-18 it is clear that the large stock with which the latter year began has been eaten away not only as rapidly, but even more rapidly. Evidence of this is given in a tabular form with regard to certain of the chief commodities.Stocks Percentage change.	December 1st compared with		December 1st compared with		September 1st.

If the chief cereal, wheat, be taken by itself the statement made in an earlier Report may be repeated, though in an altered and more emphatic form. On September 1st the stock of wheat, including the stock on farms, may be reckoned as providing for 27f weeks&apos; consumption; on December 29th it was equal to only 19 weeks&apos; provision.The case of live stock was. dealt with last week, where what is equivalent to a decrease in the capital of the country side was shown.i The causes have to be looked for in either increased consumption or a falling off in supplies. So far as.the consumption of bread and flour is concerned, an increased, consumption appears in the statistical tables (Table E) from the middle of September to the middle of November, but the last four weeks&apos; period, that ending with December 8th, shows a stationary condition as compared with the previous period. With regard to meat, the, total consumption has fallen, since July,, despite the temporary rise in&apos; October. But this, though no doubt beneficial, has not prevented an increase in the - consumption of home-fed meat. This latter is shown, in the various statistics as to slaughter and the entry of fat stock into the markets taken together. ...... .In both cases then the really effective reason for the change in the position lies-in the serious diminution, of imports to which repeated attention has been called. Low importation has been a marked feature and that of the present week is the lowest on record since these Weekly Reports have been issued.In certain instances actual shortages have occurred, due partly to the general cause alluded to and partly to special circumstances. Tea was scarce but it is hoped that the deficiency in this article will be partially made good in the early months of the new year. The position with regard to bacon and of butter, taken together with margarine, is more serious. The supplies of bacon both from, abroad and from home sources have been curtailed, the latter in part owing to the failure during the breeding season in the spring. Likewise the supplies of butter are low, owing to various reasons, and the output of home margarine, though increasing, has not made good the
falling off in butter and in imported margarine ; moreover, it must be remembered that the raw material of margarine is among the imports.  .Both the present difficulties and those greater ones which are foreshadowed have rendered necessary the regulation of distribution and of price. The former has already been.practised with regard to sugar and the new year will see a more formal and uniform system introduced whilst local, efforts have been directed to a control over the distribution of. butter andAs to prices, the position can be briefly summarised. The rapid advance which was in progress during the spring and summer has been checked, a feature the more noteworthy because of the shortage in certain supplies which has occurred during the last four months. Not only so but certain prices have fallen or been reduced, and the fall, in the cost of living of the average working class family during the last few months may be stated at 8 per cent. . ... , :    ;The changes during the present week are not dissimilar from those of the month. 1 ....       &apos;&apos;Imports.The import of the principal foods is very low, the total, 76,000 tons, constituting a record in this respect.; Wheat and wheaten flour is conspicuous among the commodites which exhibit decrease, the imports having fallen from 71,000 tons last week to 31,000 tons for the week: under review. There is also a decline of over 40 per cent, in the case of bacon and ham. On the other hand the import of other cereals though still low is larger than that of the previous week, rice reappears with an import of 4,551 tons; whilst the amount of tea is greater than that for any week since&apos; the beginning of June, the imports of 5,413 tons being about equal to two weeks&apos; consumption of the home population.Consumption of Meat.While the numbers of the fat cattle and sheep entering the markets for the preceding week were large (Table C), those for the week ending December 26th showed, as is usual, a marked decline. Taken together, however, these two weeks display a marked increase over the corresponding two weeks of last year. It is to be expected that some decrease will manifest itself during the immediate future.0The home-fed meat entering the markets in each of these two weeks was slightly less than that for the corresponding week of 1916........ Stocks.In Table G a table is added, showing the estimate formed by the Board of Agri-culture as to the number of live&quot; stock on December 4th as compared with June 4th. This was commented on last week (week ended December 26th). During the winter there is a normal decrease in the live stock other than that kept for breeding, particularly in the case for sheep. The enquiries made by the Reporters of the Board go to show that the decrease this year is greater than the normal. Calculated as percentages on the numbers of December 1916, the decline is as follows :  Cattle   -        -        -        -       ; -     5*3 per cent.Sheep   -    ,    -        -        -        -     8*1 per cent.Riga     -    &apos;    -    -v --        - -    19&apos;0 per cent.These figures correspond in general with the results of the slaughter-house returns. It should be noticed further that the reports also estimate, a reduction in dairy stock of 4 per cent, and in ewes kept for breeding of over 6 per. cent.* Moreover, the Cattle Sales Order came into force 27th December.A  4763-1O
