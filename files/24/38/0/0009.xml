Intelligence Bureau,SECRET.Department of Information.0/44. j, 18.The German Rule in Belgium!,! 0 3 A 5 D U I!enQuite recently a Dutch Professor, Mr. Niermayer, in a letter to the Netherlands Press drew attention to what he stigmatised, as the &quot;intolerable&quot; state of affairs now reigning in Belgium. He proposed that a Committee composed of Delegates from all the neutral States grhould hold an enquiry into the present conditionof that unfortunate country;   and if Germany refuses, it *wfcH* prove her guilt.     It is only possible in a short Memorandum to touch rapidly on the principle ^ointg    but it seems important that the action of the German Authorities in Belgium sinee the outbreak of war sho ild be more fully realised.The Report of the Bryce Commission and many other works havealready dealt with the abominationsbo-riitted by the German soldieryin August and September 1914.     Ht. Troelstra, a leading Butch Socialist and by no means adversely disposed to the Germans, recently estimated that 5000 Belgian civilians were caass&amp;cxad and some 2600 houses burnt with the connivance, and often bp theprobably a conservative one and it takes no^acount of the des-truction wrought to Churches, bridges, railway stations, factories and country houses, numbers of which were burnt, often with use-less malignity.     No mention is made by Mr. Troelstra of countless outrages on women and children who were sometimes but not always subsequently massacred.     It is not necessary to allude further to what occurred during the first weeks of the war;    the objectdirect order, of the Cermailoffioers Corps.     This estimate is
of this Memorandum is to deal briefly with what has occured sinceGermany definitely tcoupied the greater part of the country.Uo to November 1917 the 0 &quot;overnor General has levied on the in-habitants a War. Contribution of sixty millions sterling.     Acoordingto the 1910 census the population of Belgium amounted to 7^ millions,that is a little more than Greater London;   so it will be realisedhow crushing the war-taxation has been.   This figure does not ofcourse include deliberate pillage, nor the oollosal loss of propertyby deliberate destruction.     It is not at present known what this hasbeen;   but the amount has been officially calculated at  330.000.000.alsoit must further be realised that enormous fines have/been imposed on such localities and private persons as have incurred the anger&apos; of the German authorities.     ?or instance the cash balances of the National Bank and&apos;the SociStS Generale de Belgique ( 17 millions) were confiscated.     Almost all the-stocks of raw materials, working machinery, tools, etc have been impounded and sent to Germany for use in the factories of that country,     Y/ithin .the last few months the inhabitants have been forced to deliver all metals in their possession and even Church Bells and bronze statues in public places have not been spared.     Works of art and silver-plate literally by the truck-load have been seized and sent across the German frontier.   These very material losses do not include the damage incurred by stoppage of trade and by the exile of some hundreds of thousands of refugees. It is hardly necessary to allude to the moral sufferings of the Belgians;   but it is quite certain that they are imperfectly realised in the Allied countries.   The esses of Captain .?ryett and Miss Cavei; have become widely known.     These persons being British subjects, their murder appeals to the hearts of our race throughout the world. But there have been dozens, perhape hundreds, af Belgian Pryetts and Cavells.   Men and women have ever and over again been done to death
merely because they loved their country.     Even more apoalling in its cruelty has been the treatment meted out to Belgians of every age and sex who have been torn from their homes, sent to Germany, and there brutally ill-treated and often made to manufacture shells to slaughte their brothers at the front.    Belgian workmen have again and again been literally worked to death, or returned.to Belgium mere wrecks.But the foregoing is not the sum of German infamy.    Not consent with ruining the present of the country the German Authorities, fearing Belgian competition after the war, are doing all they can to prevent a repetition in the future of an inconvenient state of things Furnaces have been deliberately wrecked, valuable plant transferred to the manufacturing districts of the Rhineland, trade seorets stolen and fine craftsmen forced to work for their oppressors.     In fact, no stone has been left unturned to retard a return to prosperity which might interfere with German trade.But this is not all.     It is no secret that for generations therehas been much friction between the Walloons and Flemings.     Thisfriction is to a considerable extent linguistic, the Flemings being,not unreasonably, of opinion that they should be permitted to usetheir language officially and to develop in their own way withoutinterference from the V/alloons, who are the stronger body in theState.     With the exception of a few unconsidered agitators, who areunder German influence, neither the Walloonsnar the Flemings desireforeign interference in what is after all, a purely internal question.Long before the present war the Pan-German Professor of Philologyhad discovered that the Flemings were really unredeemed Germantobrethren who were pining tks. exchange the savage rule of the French-Walloons for Eultur.     So for many months everything had oeen done by the invaders to aggravate the existing friction between the races. Apparently the result has been meagre, and it is interesting to note
that there are actually more Flemings serving on the Belgian front than Walloons.     This fact seems a crushing reply to the German pretension that the Flemings are languishing under the Walloon oppression.It is not necessary to refer to the countless petty disabilities under which the Belgians labour.     Every annoyance which Prussian-ism is oapahle of inflicting on an unresisting victim is made use tf.    As a typical instance one will suffioe to show the kind of legislation introduced.     A Belgian may not briAg a libel action unless with the permission of the localGerman Authorities.     That is to say that any Belgian, man, woman or firm may be publicly maligned or insulted in the Press without any legal remedy, unless the local military Censor, under whfse authority the libel was propagated, is pleased to give permission to bring an action.
