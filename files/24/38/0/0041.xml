5.    TONNAGE PURCHASED ABROAD.The s.s. &quot;WAR ARM3UR&quot; built at Yokohama was delivered on the 28th December.6.    AMERICAN TROOPING.The Americans have accepted the offer of the &quot;AQUITANIA&quot; and &quot;MAURITANIA&quot; for the conveyance of their troops9 and the Admiralty far Staff have agreed to these vessels being used.    The sanction of the War Cabinet is nowawaited.7.    SUPPLIES FOR THE ARMY&quot; IN FRANCE. c   &apos;       ^^W^^F^The total quantity of military stores discharged in France during the week ended 29th December was 130,114 tons.8,    EXCHANGE OF BRITISH AND GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR-The sea conveyance of these prisoners is about to begin, the s.s. &quot;SINDORO&quot;, &quot;KONIGIN REGENTES&quot; and &quot;ZEELAND&quot; being the vessels in which it is arranged to effect the transfer between England and Holland.   A Naval Transport Officer has been specially appointed to Boston, Lincolnshire, y/hich is the terminal port in this country, to attend to the transport arrangements, and everything is in order for the transfer.9.    LOSS OF TWO TROOP SHIPS.The troopship &quot;ARAGON&quot; was lost on the 30th December off Alexandria, and the troopship &quot;OSM&amp;NIEH&quot; on the following day in approximately the same place.   In the case of the &quot;ARAGON&quot;, it is uncertain whether the cause of the casualty was a mine or torpedo, and no information is yet to hand as to the cause of the loss of the &quot;QSMNIEH&quot;.&quot;ARAGON&quot;The missing are:-7 Officers 455 other ranksAlso
Also the master, chief officer, chief engineer, arid 16 of the.crew.All the Nurses were saved. &quot;OSMANIBB&quot;;-2 Officers 199 other ranks6 Naval ratings7 Nursing sisters The Gommanding Officer of the vessel and 18 of the crew were killed.10.    00NVEYANQE OF-COOLIES&quot; ERQM CHINA,The entire cessation of the coolie service from Northern China is an urgent question in view of the need for the allocation of more tonnage to the North Atlantic for the conveyance of American troops, and the matter has been submitted to the War Cabinet fdr its consent to the stoppage of this service.11.    MEDITERRANEAN LINE Off COMICATION.The Taranto route has now been re-opened for stores as well as troops *Troops for India and Basra are now going via Taranto instead of via the Cape.   It is hoped that in , adopting this course, a saving of some seven or eight shins will be effected.12.    INDIAN CAVALRY WW.The move of a large number of Indian Cavalry from Prance to Egypt will shortly take place, and the necessary transport arrangements are being made for this.
13.    TRANSPORT OF 5000 SERBS PROM RUSSIA.Arrangements are being made to provide sea conveyance for 5,000 Serbs now in Russia, from Dairen (Dalny) to Salonika.14.&apos;   STONE AND SLAG- SERVICE TO FRANCE.With a view to economy of shipping tonnage, a memorandum setting forth the urgency of discontinuing this service has been submitted to the War Cabinet.15.    REMOVAL OF STEAMERS FROM THE BALTIC.V-Since the last report regarding the removal of British steamers from the Baltic to this country (see paragraph 7 of my letter of the 10th December) three further steamers, the gross tonnage of which is 5,700 tons, have safely arrived in United Kingdom ports.   Three more steamers, totalling 4,457 gross tons, have arrived in Swedish waters, and, according to the latest report, are en route from Stockholm to Christiania.The latest information in regard to the negotiations which are in progress for the removal from the Baltic of Russian owned steamers is, that a Commission which was held at Petrograd on the 19th December aporoved of the vessels, being removed, but stated that the final decision rested with the Central Baltic Fleet Committee.   Endeavours are being made to hasten this &apos; decision, which was expected on January 2nd.   Even should this Committee give their sanction in the matter, it is considered very unlikely that the removal of the vessels will be effected this year owing to the lateness of the season, and, the conseouent cessation of navigation in the Baltic.16.    ITALIAN/COAL SHIPMENTS,The total amount of coal shipped to Italy during December will be 400,000 tons, more than 75 per cent of this being in British ships.   This is a much better result than was obtained in November when the total just failed to reach 300,000 tons.
Certain.17.   PBNQB GOAL SHIPIttTS.These shipments continue to be satisfactory, the amount going from England plus the amount mined in France equalling the total French requirements as stated by the French Government.18.   SHORTAGE OF COAL IN U.S.A.The representative of the Ministry of Shipping in New York has reported a lamentable situation as regards supply of coal at the American Seaboard.    Owing to the disorganization of the railways and the effect of holidays on labour there are 18 British linors delayed at New York waiting for bunker coals. There are also about 100 American and Allied steamers similarly waiting.   It is hoped, however, that the action of the U.S.A. Government in taking over tho railways will improve the nosition. Meantime a ship is being sent from the United Kingdom to New York with 7000 tons of bunker coal to release some   of the British and Allied ships waiting for coal.19.   COAL FOR THE EGYPTIAN RAILWAYS.It has been necessary owing to military activity in Palestine to increase the amount of coal shipped to Egypt for the Egyptian State Railways.   The Shioping Controller has guaranteed to provide tonnage for 40,000 tons per month in 1918 as against 25,000 tons per month in 1917.20.   RUSSIAN POSITION AS AT 3rd JANUARY 1918.Since the last resort regarding the Russian position was submitted, the various vessels then at Murmansk discharging, have, on War Cabinet instructions beon ordered back to this country and several of them have already arrived, and are now discharging.   The disposal of their cargoes is being carried out in conjunction with various departments interested.
Certain vessels were en route for, or had arrived at Vladivostock principally with railway material.   These vessels have been diverted to Japan and their&apos; cargoes are now being discharged there.   In two cases the steamers had actually arrived at Yladivostock and begun discharge, but these have now left that port for Japan.Stoppage of shipments of all kinds from all parts has taken place and nothing at the present moment is being sent to Russia, with the exception of a little coal for our own Fleet purposes to Murmansk,The vessels of the Russian Mercantile Marine .aro gradually being made use of as they arrive in this country or in America for the needs of tho Allies.I am, .  Sir, Your obedient servant,(Sgd.)    John Anderson-
