[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1913.SECRET. G.T.-3293.THE LABOUR SITUATION,Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 9th January, 1918,Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The situation on the Clyde is examined.Part II: Press Opinions.The war aims manifesto of the Labour Conference, peace propaganda, man-power, and food are the most important questions discussed in the Labour Press.Part III: District Reports.The 12^ Per cerLt- award has led to serious trouble with members of the Electrical Trades Union in London. The shop stewards have held a national conference at Manchester.   Generally, the industrial position is anxious.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving Stoppages. The Sheffield strike is over. Strikes of engineers and smiths at Gorton and Dukinfleld have been settled. A somewhat serious strike of boilermakers is reported from the Clyde.(6.) Not involving Stoppages. The Electrical Trade Union threatened to strike on the question of the 12^ per cent, award, but this has been averted. The East Hope Street dispute on the Clyde still causes anxiety. The number of disputes concerning the 12^ per cent, award is increasing.I. General Remarks.The Situation on the Clyde.During the whole of the past year the situation on the Clyde has given cause for anxiety, and on several occasions the situation was critical. The source of anxiety lay mainly in the attitude and influence of the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee. In the autumn matters were comparatively quiet, and there were reasons for the belief that the influence of the Workers&apos; Committee had diminished, and signs of its replacement by the Industrial Workers of Great Britain and the Committee of Shop Stewards, both of which are more moderate in tone and outlook The Workers&apos; Committee, however, has made an effort to regain its former commanding position, and in this effort has effected a rapprochement with the other two important workers&apos; organisations. This course has been facilitated by several unfortunate circumstances, which may be classed as due directly or indirectly to the conduct of the war.Of these the most prominent is the trouble caused by the 12^ per cent, advance. Originally framed to meet the special claims of certain classes of skilled workers, the difficulty of discrimination has led to a general claim on the part of all workers and to a condition described by the local representative of the Ministry of Munitions[1100-11] B
as &quot;a general feeling of dissatisfaction and revolt.&quot; Resistance to the demand has led to strikes in certain quarters, not confined to munitions works, and the immediate future is distinctly anxious.Another disturbing cause is found in the alleged cases of victimisation of which the East Hope Street affair is much the most serious. The facts of that case have already been reported, but may be described very shortly as closure of their works by Messrs. Beardmore, in order to avoid compulsion to reinstate certain women workers who had been dismissed. The case of the women has been vigorously taken up by the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee, who threaten to bring out the whole of Scotland unless satisfaction is obtained. They are supported by the Manchester shop stewards, who have voiced a similar intention for England. The most unfortunate feature of the case has been the refusal of the employer to submit to arbitration in the matter, but the latest information is that a settlement has been negotiated by the Ministry of Labour.The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee has now taken up an extreme attitude on the subject of man-power, and it jis threatened that any withdrawal &quot;of skilled or unskilled labour from industry will meet with opposition, and will be countered by the calling of a general strike. In this position the organisation is supported by the very important pacifist element. The Clyde has been the scene of a widespread and determined pacifist propaganda for the last year, the I.L.P. and the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade being the chief agents, and their efforts have met with remarkable success. The need for vigorous action on the Clyde by the War Aims Committee has been urged several times in these reports, and the evident progress which pacifist doctrines are making there, renders action more than ever necessary. It is now announced that the Clyde &quot;Workers&apos; Committee is calling a representative assembly of shop stewards for the 27th instant, with the object of congratulating Russia on its Labour Government and demanding that the British Government initiate negotiations for peace. It cannot be doubted that an impressive demonstration will be arranged.The general situation on the Clyde is thus demonstrated to be serious. It is further complicated by the food shortage, and the revolutionary element is exploit-ing the possibilities of the situation to which the shortage has given rise. The C.W.C. has passed a resolution that if the Government did not hand over all food-stuffs now held by &quot;profiteers&quot; to the co-operative and other kindred societies, they would advocate a national strike.&quot; A further cause of the deep-seated unrest in Glasgow lies in the appalling housing conditions. The Central Billeting Board has recently conducted an enquiry, and the following extracts may be quoted from their Report:-&quot; We inspected a certain number of houses in Glasgow, particularly ;n the Anderton Quay district, and were appalled by the conditions which were found there. It was stated to us that two-thirds of the population of Glasgow (now somewhat over a million) live in one room apartment houses. Many of these single rooms are occupied by two and- occasionally more families, and cases constantly occur where each family takes in lodgers. The conditions resulting from such a state of things can be better imagined than described.&quot; We are convinced that serious industrial trouble will result if some immediate steps are not taken, and we were continually faced with the unanswerable question of whether the Government wished the Clyde workers to resort to extreme steps before dealing with a problem which was universally admitted to be a matter of the most extreme and desperate urgency. We feel that if steps are taken at once to build immediately between 2,000 and 3,000 houses in selected areas such a move on the part of the Government would do more to allay industrial unrest on the Clyde than any other action.&quot;It is understood that the Ministry of Munitions are taking action in this matter, and it is to be hoped that it will be pressed forward as rapidly as possible.An improvement in the supply or distribution of food would do much to weaken the agitators, and their position would be further affected by well-judged propa-ganda on the part of the War Aims Committee. The Prime Minister^ speech has undoubtedly had an excellent effect throughout the country, and what is needed is. to (Iriye i\ hqme before the pacifist organisations have time to distort and misrepresent it. There would then remain the purely industrial problems, which, though in themselves difficult, would be more easy to handle. The most serious Immediate question is that of the East Hope Street Factory, where conditions are
at present of the nature of a deadlock, and in reference to which an Emergency Committee has now been formed, which has called upon all Clyde workers to join in support of the displaced women. Isolated action by the Clyde on the man-power question would be unlikely to receive general support, and consequently to prove dangerous, if the proposals of the Government (which have not yet been disclosed) are accepted by the representatives of organised Labour generally.It has to be remembered, however, that many of the leading spirits in the extreme movement ape themselves liable to be called up under any &quot; combing out &quot; scheme, and that they are therefore likely to overthrow, if they can, any agreement made with the Trade Unions. All their efforts to exploit other causes of unrest are largely directed towards producing conditions which will render a &quot; comb out &quot; impossible, and it is said that in their view the effectiveness of a strike would be in the fact that it would so retard the output of ships and munitions as to make it impossible to take away any men at all, if the deficiency were to be made up. Where men of this kind have attained a position of Considerable power in a district, where owing to bad industrial and social conditions unrest springs from natural sources, and where pacifist propaganda has made some headway, there is certainly danger of a formidable &quot;stop-the-war &quot; strike taking place on the &quot;comb out&quot; question, which might seriously damage the position of the Allies by suggesting that they cannot go on fighting for long.II. Press Opinions.The Labour press has had a plethora of material during the past week, on which to expand, but the Prime Minister&apos;s speech, and the Bolshevik rejection of the German terms, came too late for comment this week. War Aims have been dis-cussed at length, in view of the manifesto by the Labour Party and Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. In addition, pacifist propaganda,&apos;the prospective calls on industry for man-power, the recognition of the shop stewards, and the perennial food question are the chief subjects with which the journals deal.The War Aims Manifesto.The Resolution on War Aims passed by the Conference on Friday, the 28th December, has been acclaimed by the most influential section of the Labour press, chiefly as an indication of the trend of Labour opinion towards pacifism. To the LL.P. the Memorandum is not entirely acceptable, according to the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; on the ground that it does not go far enough. That paper criticises the pronouncements as to the Turkish. Empire and the future of tropical Africa, and holds that, logically, the recommendation to liberate subject races should have included those now subject to French, British, Italian, and American authority. It records that the change in the attitude towards the Alsace-Lorraine question is due to acceptance of an I.L.P. amendment to the draft memorandum. The Con-ference affords to the &quot;Herald &quot; the opportunity for another long and purely pacifist article,- headed &quot; Labours Lead for Peace,&quot; while responsible and moderate papers, such as &quot; Forward&quot; and the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; render unqualified support to the Memorandum.Opposition comes from the &quot;New Witness,&quot; the &quot;Clarion,&quot; &quot;Justice,&quot; and the &quot; British Citizen and Empire Worker,&quot; and is directed not only to the contents of the memorandum, but to the constitution of the Conference and its methods, which precluded the consideration of amendments. It is also alleged by these journals that the delegates who attended the meeting had obtained no mandate on the subject for discussion.Peace Propaganda.There are numerous pacifist articles in addition to those based on the Labour Conference. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; has, for instance, one headed &quot; The Murder of Conscientious Objectors,&quot; with special reference to Arthur Butler, Scott Duckers, and J. B. Saunders, whose cases are related in eoctenso, while the &quot;Herald &quot; returns to the charge with a long essay on the subject &quot; What Then Are We Fighting For? &quot; in which it attempts to show that the war aims of Germany and Austria are practically identical with those of Russia and of French and
British Labour. This was, of course, written before Trotzky&apos;s refusal of the German conditions as to the Baltic Provinces was known. The &quot; New Age &apos;&apos; prints an article pointing out that the present revival of peace talk entirely ignores America, who may be expected to have something, material to say on the subject.Man-Power.The &quot; South Wales Pioneer &quot; protests against the breach of promise implied in cancelling the pledges of protection in certain classes of Labour. The &quot; Call &quot; also refers to this aspect of the new proposals, and further calls upon the trade unions to refuse to sacrifice any men, skilled or unskilled, while the &quot; New Age &quot; insists on the opportunity for a bargain on terms satisfactory to Labour. All comments are, however, affected by the absence of any detailed or precise knowledge of the arrangements which Sir Auckland Geddes is proposing.Food.All journals touch on this subject, the more advanced continuing to demand nationalisation of supply (the &quot;Call,&quot; &quot;Bradford Pioneer,&quot; &amp;c.) and compulsory rationing (&quot;Labour Leader &quot; and many others). Criticism of the Food Controller continues acute, even where, as in the &quot;Call,&quot; his intentions are recognised as excellent. Profiteering is alleged still to exist, and is emphasised by &quot;Forward &quot; in a prominent article &quot; Profiteers and Their Plunder.&quot; The question of food was discussed at the Labour Conference, and Mr. Eobert Smillie&apos;s somewhat cheap gibes as to the offer of the Controllership to himself are noted with approving comment in the &quot;Herald,&quot; which makes a good point, however, in quoting the &quot;Times&apos; &quot; scorn of Mr. Smillie&apos;s criticisms after his refusal of office, and drawing attention tc the similarity between his position and that of Lord Northcliffe.III. District Reports.London.The question of the proposed &quot; comb-out &quot; continues to be the subject of much discussion among workers at Woolwich and elsewhere. They allege that all Govern-ment pledges are given with the object of obtaining concessions from Labour, and that when Labour has made its sacrifice the pledges are no longer honoured. It is said, therefore, that the workers must take the matter into their own hands.Apart from this, the main causes of discontent at Woolwich have been the meat shortage and some trouble over the use of air raid shelters.There has been great unrest among electricians in the London district, and during the week-end a serious strike over the 12^ per cent, bonus (described in Section IV) was with difficulty averted.A very lively and crowded meeting was held by the Electrical Trades Union at Holborn on the 7th instant, at which the General Secretary announced the award, and said, amid loud cheers, that the Government had been beaten by the greatest weapon of all the right to strike.  The following resolution was passed: &quot; That if any member of the E.T.U. in the London district were called to the Colours we immediately call a mass meeting for a general strike.&quot;The members of this Union are stated to be anxious for a strike in order to demonstrate their power to the Government. It is reported that a movement is on foot among them to amalgamate with the A.S.E.Unrest among aircraft workers continues, and at Hendon the men have been threatening to strike over the alleged victimisation of an active trade unionist named Tompkins.This unrest has spread to Norwich where there is discontent at the introduc-tion of a premium bonus system.West Midlands.Great dissatisfaction is manifest in the Birmingham area regarding the 12i per cent, award, and several strikes have occurred. It is thought that unless this award is paid by the 12th instant or some definite statement made a stoppage of
work among members of the General Workers&apos; Union may take place. The men accuse the Government of being directly responsible for the delay.It is reported that a Conference is to be arranged at an early date amongst the trade unions in the Midlands to make arrangements for meetings to be held to secure a strong volume of public opinion in favour of the Labour Party&apos;s Peace Aims.At Coventry the food question is still a serious cause of discontent, and the local Trades Council propose to ask the Government to commandeer meat and fish supplies in order to secure a fairer distribution.Coventry and Birmingham branches of the Navvies and General Labourers&apos; Unions have passed a resolution urging the Government to take stronger action against profiteering and food hoarders. They have also protested against any men being taken for the army before wealth is conscripted. Should the proposed comb-out in munitions factories take place it is feared that serious trouble may follow.Yorkshire and East Midlands.As the result of the serious strike which arose in Sheffield over the 12^ per cent, award (see Section IV), there has been great unrest throughout the entire area, and the temper of the men is said to be uncompromising.With reference to the food situation, it is stated that accurate returns would show that all workers in the engineering and allied trades are consuming quantities much in excess of any past period. This may account for local shortages, and suggests that compulsory rationing, after its introduction, may become unpopular.North-Western.In common with most districts the 12-1 per cent, bonus is the cause of much dissatisfaction in the Manchester area, and many threats of strikes are reported. McManus, of Glasgow, took the chair at a National Conference of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees and Amalgamation Committees: The fusion of the two movements (that is, the shop stewards and the amalgamation movements), the food question, and the Government&apos;s new man-power proposals, were the chief subjects discussed. Several leading shop stewards advised strongly against fusion, and it was eventually resolved that the time was not opportune for the formation of a new union.. Some bitterness was displayed during the proceedings, and, after the resolution had been put, the delegates of the Amalgamation Committee were requested to withdraw.It was evident throughout the man-power discussion that all delegates repre-senting important industrial centres were opposed to the comb-out. In the case of London and the Clyde a &quot; Stop the War &quot; policy was strongly advocated.A mass meeting of the Joint Engineering Trades of the Oldham district, held on the 6th, and attended by some four thousand men, passed a resolution demanding that the unions should not make arrangements with the Government without first taking a ballot vote of the unions. .Craftsmen on the Furness Railway are still causing anxiety, and trouble is likely to arise again over the payment of the district rate.North-Eastern.Trouble among the moulders on the North-East Coast regarding the 12^ per cent, threatened to lead to a strike. An award of one-eighth of ordinary earnings has now been granted piece and extra time workers. This has been received with satisfaction, and the men are returning to the piece-work and extra time-work which they had refused to perform.South Wales.The situation in this district is rather quieter, though still uneasy. At a recent meeting of naval colliery miners at Tonypandy; the following resolu-tions were passed: (1.) &quot;To urge the Government to keep down the prices of food, and to adopt&apos;a better method of distribution.&quot; (2.) &quot; Not to pay Income Tax until the wealth of the country is conscripted.&quot;[1100-11] C
Speaking at Forth, Glamorgan, Tom Mann alleged that the cold stores at Liverpool were full of carcases; that bacon was deteriorating in unsuitable ware-houses; that food ships were held up in the Mersey for eight days before beino-discharged, and that the meat was infested with rats. He blamed the Food Controller, and suggested that profiteers were working behind the scenes.Mr. James Winstone, addressing an I.L.P meeting at Deri, said that the Government would be well advised to take serious note of the rumblings now going on, not only in South Wales coalfields, but all over the country.Scotland.The situation on the Clyde is dealt with at length in Section I. Ireland.The industrial situation in Ireland continues to be marked by a good deal of unrest. Low wages and food troubles appear to be the chief causes, and the trade unions are said to be making great progress among the young workers.Strikes continue to occur in different industries throughout the country.IV. Disputes. (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.Although, as a result of a conference held at the Ministry of Munitions, the serious strike at Sheffield, involving 12,000 workers, in the iron and steel trade has been settled, agitation regarding the 12  per cent, bonus is reported to pervade practically every district.It will be remembered that the Sheffield workers demanded that they should participate in the award which has been made to the engineering sections of industry. It has been decided that workers employed in direct connection with the production of iron and steel, including those whose wages are governed by sliding scales, are entitled to the equivalent of 12\ per cent, on earnings, when they have received not more than 20s. war advance; where this advance has been exceeded, sufficient to produce an equivalent to 20s. plus 12J per cent, on earnings.   The men resumed work on Monday, the 7th.The strike of riveters concerning the 12^ per cent, award, which involved about a thousand men at Messrs. Cammell, Laird, Birkenhead, has been settled, and the men resumed work on the 4th.Strikes referred to in last week&apos;s report among piece-workers at Belfast and sheet-metal workers at Bilston, involving respectively 2,000 and 1,500 men, have been temporarily settled, and the men have resumed work pending negotiation. In each case the strike arose out of the 12  per cent, award.In addition to the strikes mentioned above, the Ministry of Munitions reports that the stoppage of work amongst the engineers and smiths at the Great Central Railway workshops at Gorton and Dukinfield has been very serious. The strike broke out on New Year&apos;s Eve over the 12^ per cent, bonus, and 5,000 were involved.Although the men at Gorton were granted the bonus, they refused to return until the employees at Dukinfield received the same award, but on the bonus being extended to Dukinfield work wa&amp; resumed on the 7th inst. It is reported, however, that men engaged in a similar capacity on the whole of the Great Central Railway&apos;s system have been urged to demand the 12  per cent, increase by the 19th.A number of other strikes arising out of the 121 per cent, question have taken place recently. Some of these were due merely to the irritation caused through delay in paying the bonus; others took the form of a protest against exclusion.The Shipyard Labour Department reports two new cases of strike: one at Bristol and one at Birmingham; the number of men involved 600.The position of the 3,000 boilermakers employed on piece-work by Messrs. Beardmore, Armstrong Whitworth, and other firms, who ceased work in support of their demand for the 12J per cent, bonus, has been stationary owing to the Scottish holidays. An early settle-ment is anticipated.Only one new strike is reported this week by the War Office Contracts Depart-ment.A sympathetic strike has occurred in the greatcoat department of J. Hunter and Son, Limited, Liverpool, on account of a dispute in another department engaged on civilian clothing.   A considerable number of workers are reported to be concerned.
There are no fresh strikes reported this week by the Coal Controller. It should be noted, however, that on the 28th December 2,000 men at the Staveley Coal and Iron Company struck work in order to enforce their demand for the 12  per cent, advance. In consequence of  his four collieries belonging to the company have been compelled to close down, and several thousand men have been thrown idle.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.The most serious dispute reported this week by the Ministry of Munitions was that of the electrical workers in London, who threatened to strike unless their demand for inclusion in the 12^ per cent, award were granted.It is stated that the dispute arose owing to the failure of certain controlled establish-ments to give the men the 12^ per cent, increase that was promised to them a long time ago.Sir George Askwith, at the request of the War Cabinet, met representatives of the employers concerned and of the Electrical Trades Union on the 7th instant, and an agree-ment was arrived at by which the men will receive the award. The promptness with which this award was issued probably averted a serious strike.&quot;With reference to the recent strike which arose out of the dismissal of four women from Messrs. W. Beardmore and Company, Limited, East Hope Street, Glasgow, the Emergency Committee which was then established have issued a manifesto alleging that the investigation into this case which was promised has not taken place, and calling upon the Clyde workers to take action in sympathy. The indications are that this trouble may have serious conseqences, as the shop stewards throughout the district are threatening to take action (see Section I).In regard to the negotiations that have been proceeding for some time past in connec-tion with grievances of aircraft workers in the London district, the men are becoming impatient, and threaten to strike on the 10th instant if an agreement is not reached and notified before that date.Twelve new cases of dispute are reported by the Shipyard Labour Department.Unrest is still manifest among riveters on the Clyde, and resolutions have been passed expressing dissatisfaction with the awards of the Committee on Production regarding rates, and demanding that the claims put forward at the recent arbitration be granted in full, and threatening, in the event of this not being accepted, to stop work on the 14th insjjant. Iron-moulders in the Clyde area are very restless. Strikes have occurred over alleged cases of victimisation. In addition to demands for their inclusion in the 12J per cent, award, the men are clamouring for a reduction of working hours, and threaten to &quot; down tools if they meet with refusal.The Coal Controller reports one new case of dispute involving a stoppage of work.A dispute has arisen in Derbyshire owing to the alteration in the time of the running of a workmen&apos;s train; this has involved the partal stoppage of three large collieries. The matter is being dealt with by the colliery companies and the railway company.Several applications have been received by the War Office Contracts Depart-ment for the extension of the 12^ per cent, bonus to members of various unions.The National Union of General Workers has put in an appeal on behalf of unskilled workers engaged in taking down plant for the Ironhurst Peat Factory for removal to France.The Chief Industrial Commissioners Department reports 109 new differences during the week. Of these 38 are in the engineering, shipbuilding, and other metal trades.During the week under review twenty-five awards have been received from single arbitrators or courts of arbitration. The most important award is perhaps the award of the court of arbitration appointed to determine the claim of blastfurnacemen in the United Kingdom for extra payment for week-end work.Nineteen cases have been heard during the past week by the Committee on Production in London. The National Association of Carpenters and Joiners made an application for increased rates on behalf of their members on aircraft work at Liverpool.D. J. SHACKLETON.o
