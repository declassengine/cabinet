extent the fuel supply, is it even talking of actual organisation: it will need cash assistance on a large scale and without conjunction with French Government coupled with effective (?) Military pressure afforded (by?) United States and Japan the entry in support can hardly last for any length of time; this connection with Siberia is so important that it should seem advisable to keep in close contact with Americans who are not mentioned in Director of Military Intelligence^ telegram and whose representative at Novocheriask Mr,. Poole telegraphs most interesting reports to his Moscow Consulate,Here as elsewhere the Bourgeoisie is quite apathetic of political condition though very many of them are busying themselves throughout Russia with commercial speculation particularly in food stuff; the Bolshevick movement thrives most in manufacturing districts but must be reckoned with everywhere (as?) the only active political movement in Russia, and permeates the whole country including the Cossack territory eastward to Ukraine, where however it can assert itself sporadically only.Though it is to be feared that the Bolshevicks will little by little have to give way to parties of even stronger anarchist tendencies yet it is not likely that they or their -successors will lose their hold on most of Russia until after the tragedies of the coming winter, during February the most acute moments may be expected:&apos; then transport will be further hampered by snowdrifts; that the inadequacy of ploughing appliances, and the impossibility of obtaining, as in other years, sufficient 1about will render difficult removal.       Even to-day the chaos throughout Russia is indescribable and it grows worse and worse daily,anything
U 3vanything in the nature of organisation is practically impossible; railways are overrun by soldiers travelling free in all directions for the purpose of trade and even Bolshevicks are incapable of exercising any check upon the journeys of their political enemies to and fro.     All the published news of actual fighting and of cutting railway communications is on the other hand much exaggerated and it is obvious that for the time being Bolshevicks are unable to launch attacks in any foroe,It occurred to me that under all these circumstances possible expedient for bringing about v/hat we desire would be for the South Eastern Federation and Ukrain together with Siberia to seize some opportunity, to come to composition with, the Bolshevicks Government in the north.Such an opportunity would arise were the governing parties in northern Russia to fall out momentarily with the central powers:   this composition would have to be on the basis of a loose confederation of autonomous states whose bond of union will be limited to resistance to Central Prw/ers and to mutual undertakings for non-Interference in one another&apos;s territory and for exchange of food and fuel from the south with say munitions and manufacture of foods from the north,The present endeavours in the south are very soon doomed to degenerate into general isolated and disconnected islands in a sea of anarchy only by some such composition with the Bolshevicks is it conceivable that the western end of Siberian connection could be definitely secured,Moreover
Moreover even were its duration short such a composition would confer the huge benefit of enabling Allies to enter openly and officially into intimate relations with each individual member of.tho general confederation, The ideas sketched in two preceding paragraphs I suggested to the leaders at Novochercask and have since learnt they arc under discussion theire(JLastly nothing can bo expected on this front at the best beyond passive resistance to the Central Powers:.-only if each remain within their own territory can there be any practical hope of boosting up the Roumanians Ukrainians and Cossacks into genuine resisting elementSo    The chief of these resisting elements should be the Roumanian Army which so long as it remains In Moldavia obstructs the most tempting enemy access to the Black Seao   Therefore that Army ought to be held in Moldavia and every possible effort made to feed it from Ukraine and Bessarabia.,    In the Don there is no surplus food and I should judge not much in the northern Caucasus that could bo made available for export9 But fuel constitutes the outstanding Roumanian difficulty and that requires the closest attention.Among other things maximum numbers and weights of trains both in Roumania and approach lines are ruled not by capacities of lines and locomotives (see General Ballardrs telegram Dec 14th.) but by fuel supply alone,   I have so far no news of Vloe Consul Waite nor has acting Vice Consul at Negropontio Tomorrow I leave for Ekatorinodar where I shall meet Eiarlamoffo   Please send all telegrams via Indo care of Vice Consul Rostoff using this cipher*Candollec
