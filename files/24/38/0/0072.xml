(MBQorandum from the First Commissioner, of Works .-I hare visited, the Natural History Museum this afternoon.     In conjunction with my expert advisors,    to-gether with the Director and other officials of the Museum, I inspected very carefully tne &quot;building and its contents; with a vie?/ to its possible utilisation, for Government offices.   Although it would be possible,    with some rearrangement of the exhibits in various galleries, to provide a certain amount of accommodation, which would be suitable, I have come to the conclusion that this would involve the closing of the building to the public.    It would also necessitate a considerable re-arrangement of the contents, and involve an enormous amount of labour and of material; and considerable delay.    Under these circumstances, there is no pressing necessity to warrant the use of the.Natural History Museum for Government Offices.(signed)     A&amp;FPJ0D MOHD.H.M. Office of Works .Sth January, 1918.
