G.T.3244SEC P SJi(THIS JOOPM313T - IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS B?JTAi,3nCyMAJESTY*S GOVERHMT)5? A RC A B I H E 0?,.90QPROPOSAL TO STOP BUT IR SPY AND AT OICE THE gg^Mgg OF COOLIE LABOURERS FROM HORTH : CntfA TO FRANCE, &apos;Memorandum by Ministry of-Shipping,At the request of the War Office, large shipments of Coolies have been made in the last 12 months by this Department from China to North France for labour purposes.The number of Coolies actually arrived or en route amounts to 83,000;   a further 22,000 are definitely programmed to embark by the end of February, and the ^var Office are asking  or the conveyance of an additional 45,000 to follow at the rate of 5,000 a month from Karen onwards.The Coolies are shipped across the Pacific, to Vancouver, raijad across Canada and brought to France from Halifax.In view of the present tonnage situation it is submitted that the question of stopping the entire import of coolies should be immediately considered.   Ten steamers of large capacity are engaged trading between China and Vancouver prin-cipally carrying Coolies.     These vessels include the &quot;EMPRESS OF RUSSIA&quot; gross 16810, &quot;EMPRESS OF ASIA&quot; gross 16909, as well as other large vessels.In addition to the great relief which would be afforded on the Trans-Atlantic run where it is not at present possible to meet the American troops requirements, there is the heavy transit across the American Continent.   Further it is estimated that 10,000 additional American troops might be brought per month (without baggage) if the Coolie traffic was entirely  . stopped.The Shipping Controller when recently in France had the opportunity of inspecting a certain amount of Chinese labour and he is satisfied that four Chinese were not doing the work of more than one man.    There seemed a total lack of organi-sation for dealing with Coolies consequent to a great extent on tho want of suitable foremen with a knowledge of Chinese to take charge, and tho Shipping Controller is of opinion that if properly dealt with, the Chinese now in France are more than capable of doing all the work which it was intended should be dono by the 150,000 which he understands it was intended to import.The Shipping Controller has communicated on the subject with Lord lerby, who intimated to the &quot;ar Cabinet his willingness to make a considerable reduction.     In the Controllers opinion the traffic should be entirely stopped at once for reasons stated.        An immediate decision is&apos; desired in view of the great need of tonnage.3rd January 1918.
