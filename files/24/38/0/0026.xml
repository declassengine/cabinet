S 1 C R E T148WAR   CABPKET.,T, 3226,Section A.DEPABTME1T OF IMPORTATION,IHTELLIGSKCE BUREAU,4th January, 1918.A HOTS OF OUR PROPAGANDA IK REPERIJiNCE TO TKB VM-GTMMm,We have come to a period of the war when the war-weariness in the European countries of the Entente and the immaturity of American opinion makes the instruction of the peoples at warover any other line of propaganda.   So far as the thought which directs, our &quot;propaganda can &quot;be discerned, it recognises in the first place the importance of maintaining in our nation, and in the nations fighting with us, the resolution to go on with.the struggle till a satisfactory peace can be secured, and- in the&apos; second place, it desires to impress our peoples with the dangerous character of the designs harboured by Germany.   This in principle   seems thoroughly&apos; s.ound,.     where, it may be suggested, we are in, danger&quot; of --making a mistake is in giving&apos; prominence to the extremer ambitions of the circles properly called Pan-German,   It appears the. natural course to wake up the public whenever it shows signs of growing torpid, by what is most, sensa-tional and calculated to make its flesh creep, and the most- extreme utterances of (jerman ambition lend themselves   most readily to this purpose.   Yet surely, if we yield to this1 first impulse, we play Kuhlmann. s game.It is time that we realised much more clearly than we have done yet, that German opinion on war-aims is divided into two sharply antagonistic camps.   Ho home propaganda can be well-directed which does not first drive this into the heads of people.-   Nothing can be more mischievous than the loose habit (encouraged by some French writers like Cheradame) of jumbling up all German designs indiscriminately under the term Pan^German./ -  :-with Germany as- to the facts off the situation take precedence
There is the Pan-German camp, properly so-csllc-d, which desires annexations in 3uropo and war-indemnities - especially the reten-tion of Belgium ana the French mining-districts ox Briey and longwy, the party who stand for what is known in Germany as a &quot;German peace&quot;; and there is the party -/hich aims at getting a peace on the status: quo basis, a peace of compromise, which would allow Germany to build up a great pover in Turkey and in Africa.     It may be doubted rihethor the Pan-Germans are really dangerous now,, because there is no chance of our ever giving way to the designs; the really dangerous people are the people in Germany who advocate a &quot;peace of understanding&quot;,-a &quot;Scheidem^nn peace&quot;, and whose policy is probably that of Kuhlmamu In order tc get the peoples opposed to   Germany to consent to a peace which would allow Germany to realise the plan of dominating Turkey and acquiring an African Smpire, it is necessary for  uhlmann to make them think that such a peace is fl) a notable concession on the part of Germany,    (2)   a concession in which Germany has the disadvantage.        Of course, to the German home public.such a settlement has to be represented in /the on osite light.-       The German Government, therefore, allows the Pan-Germans,-, for the saiie of foreign countries, to go on setting their extreme ambitions against the Scheidemann peace,, and to go on denouncing the Scheidemann peace as one that would mean the ruin of Germany.:        It allocs the other school tc demonstrate,- for the sake of the home public, that a Scheidemann peace would be disastrous for the enemy and would&quot; secure to Germany everything it required.        Hothing therefore could please ICuhlmann better than that we should continue, as many of our newspapers do, to make the British publicrs flesh creep with the Pan-&apos; German-claims.:    It is curious to note that as to the character of a Scheidemann peace the people amongst us who are in complete agreement&apos; *ith the Pan-Germans are our- crypto-pacifists,- such as &quot;The Nation&quot;.
They both affirm that such a peace would be an absolute defeat ^cr Germany.   These circles in England can therefore, when the moment comes, makte use of all the Pan-German stuff- in order to argue for our accepting a jbeace which would be a sacrifice of the very security we nave fought to gain.It is likely enough that befjre long the German Govern-ment will actually put out proposals equivalent to a Scheidemann peace.   The Pan-Germanswill fill the air with shrieks that Germany has been betrayed by its leaders, that Germany has given up everything, etc.   They will do so with the connivance of the Government,   (it is said.to be an old diplomatic trick to cause a proposed treaty to be denounced by the home press as a gratuitous concession). Our newspapers will be edified.   Only the other day, the same thing happened on a small scale; the Pan-Germans denounced the concessions made to the Bolsheviks, and immediately one might see their utterances displayed in cur evening papers under the heading&apos; &quot; an-German Ftiries&quot;.   The more attention we now call to the Pan^Germans, the more difficult will it be to stem a wave of pacifist.feeling, when Kuhlmann puts forward terms which have an appearance of moderation.The really urgent thing at the present moment is to educate the public to understand what a Scheidemann peace really means.   As the &quot;Times&quot; observes (Jan. 3rd), the Germans can afford to lose in the West if they win in the East.   If the    . British public is not&apos; going to weaken in the matter of Mesopo-tamia, it must understand what the realisation of German designs in that direction would mean for future generations of Britons; if the British public is not goin,T; to accept in Africa any settlement which involves the British Empire in continuous danger and strain, it must understand what the schemes Of the &quot;Moderate&quot; Germans in that direction mean.   This work of educa-tion has become urgent in the extreme.   Even in the rank-and-file
of our Army, according to many accounts, a war-weariness5 is rapidly spreading..     Lien ask &quot;What are we fighting for, and why should we go on Doing.killed?&quot;    What is needed is, a large effort to disseminate in popular form a clear under-standing of what a Sohei&amp;emann peace would mean, for us and for our children, so that when the moment comes for ICuhlmann to maze his proposals, our&apos; people, and the American people, may not be under any illusion,   For that purpose, we should beware of. giving prominence to the Pan-German designs;    it may be safely said that the German Government itself recognises their impossibilityc
