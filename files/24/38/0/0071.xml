Cabinet he most earnestly requested to re-consider the. proposal to utilise a portion or the whole of the Natural History Museum for other than its present purpose.In particular,  as regards the Mineral Department,  the Mineralogical Society views with alarm, any proposal to render inaccessible, born to the General Public and Students and also to enquirers respecting economic questions.  The National Collection of Minerals, which has been accumulated during the past century and a half and is now the largest and most com-plete in the world. -This Collection contains, for reference and comparison, examples of all minerals (and ores) that have been put to economic uses, representing numerous localities that&apos; have-not yet &quot;been worked commercially.    Direct reference to those parts of the Collection not exhibited to the. General Public would: supply a large amount of information, not available elsewhere, even in published works, respecting mineral occur-rences in all parts of the world.    Such information has already been utilised by the Advisory Council on Scientific and Industrial Research, by the War office, and by the Department for Development of Mineral Resources attached to the Ministry of Mun.itJ.ons of War,  and could also be of use-to the proposed Imperial Mineral Resources-Bureau.   The pro--posal to render such information inaccessible would-seriously hamper the work of all Government Departments concerned with the development of the mineral resources of the Empire.-( Sgd.-) TSn.
