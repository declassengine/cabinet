irSECRET.perty of &apos;&quot;Intelligence Bureau,Department of Jnfttr^tdon^ DRW/019.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. XIX,(8 January, 1917).On December 8 the Rumanian authorities agreed to the general armistice arranged with the Germans.     This has now been prolonged until January 14.     In view of the presence of nearly one million Russian troops in Rumania and the close association between the Rumanian and Russian fronts any other action would have been impossible.     The Rumanian Government is in close association and on the friendliest terms with General Shcherbachev and in this matter acted on the same lines as he did.     The armistice was of purely military significance.   The Rumanian Government is,not enter-ing into peace negotiations with the Central Powers, and to emphasise the fact that nothing of the kind is being attempted the King of Rumania has resigned his post of Commander-in-Chief. Rumaniafs position is almost absolutely dependent on the course of affairs in Russia.   First of all, the presence of large Russian forces in Rumania, a great proportion of whom are In favour of the Bolsheviks, vitally affect any decision of Rumanian policy.     There are only two alternatives for Rumania:   (1) To model her foreign policy on that of the Petrq^grad Government, and (2) to prepare for an inevitable clash with it.   The former solution, If it were ever possible, has been put out of the question by the attitude of the Bolsheviks towards the Rumanian Government, whom they denounce as oppressors of the proletariat.     The Russian troops in Rumania have already on more than one occasion begun a revolutionary agitation in the country, and recently their attitude has become still more threatening.   Consequently there have already been
collisions between the two forces;   Bolshevik troops have looted Rumanian villages and threatened the Rumanian authorities and in certain places the Rumanian army has seized the positions held by Russian units and disarmed the Bolsheviks there.     lere it possible to carry out the disarmament of all the Russian forces in Rumania, the situation would be very much eased, but this would pfobably be extremely difficult to do without considerable fighting and would involve Rumania in hopeless complications with Russia. The attempt may, however, be necessitated by the course of events.Secondly, the position of Rumania is indissolubly bound up with that of Russia by the fact that in the event of Russia making peace Rumania is entirely isolated.   Rumania&apos;s position in this event may be considered.(1) Should the Ukraine (not a very likely hypothesis) refuse to conclude peace with the Central Powers at the same time as the rest of Russia, Rumania would obviously follow the same course.     The situation would none the less be fraught with danger, for if the Central Powers were able to spare sufficient forces for an invasion cf Rumania, the latter, cut off from supplies and with half of her army equipped with rifles only, would find it almost impossible to resist.     None the less the Rumanian army would certainly do everything that could be done to defend the country.02) Should the Ukraine join the rest of Russia in the con-elusion of a separate peace (or even - perhaps more likely - con-clude peace by itself) and disinterest itself in Rumaniars fate, the latter&apos;s position is an impossible one.     Only, two alternatives present themselves:   (8)   The conclusion of peace with the Central Powers, and (b) the withdrawal of the Rumanian armies to the Cossack country after destruction of all available material of war. The advantage of the latter course would be that the Rumanian army would be left in being as a potential fighting fq rce and that
Rumania, like Serbia, would retain f*r herself and for the Allies as a whole the moral prestige of refusing to yield to the enemy. On the other hand, from the practical point of view Rumania&apos;s future political position might be severely prejudiced by such a complete evacuation cf the country.   This may be seen by considering the present line of German policy with regard to Rumania.German Policy Towards Rumania.1$ previous Reports some account has been given of German policy in the occupied province of lallachia and of the attempts made by the German authorities to set up a Provisional Rumanian Government in friendly relations with them (Reports XV, XVI and XVII). To the Rumanians mentioned in this connection as working with the German authorities may be now added Dr Beldiman, formerly Rumanian Minister in Berlin, who refused to endorse Bratianu!s policy of intervention and since August 1916 has been living in Copenhagen and Berlin.    Beldiman has now returned to Rumania and is heading the campaign throughout the country to conciliate Rumanian feeling with the Central Powers and to persuade the Rumanian population to disown the Bratianu Government and all those connected with it.    Mr Marghiloman, who stayed behind in Bucarest, ostensibly to continue his services to the Rumanian Red Cross, has, as it was always clear that he would, now thrown in his lot definitely with this pro-German movement.   He demands that &quot;Rumania&quot;, that is to say, presumably the population of the occupied province, should at once conclude a permanent treaty with the Central Powers with a view to the political and economic reconstruction of the country.As to the lines on which this should be proceeded with no
definite information is vouchsafed, hut one or two conjectures may be hazarded.     During the year the Germans have been in occupation of Wallachia they have had no difficulty in putting themselves more firmly than ever before in full possession of the exploitation of the wealth and industries of the country.     The petroleum industry has now as great, if not greater, an output than before the war;   scientific methods of farming have been introduced; and no effort is being spared to tap every source of national wealth.   According to German testimony the population has received the invaders with gratitude and admiration..    From a sentimental .point of view this may be doubted, but it is easy to see thatithe Germans have very important political levers to use in furtherance of their attempt to drag Rumania   within the orbit of the Central Alliance.   They appeal in Wallachia to two very different shades of opinion.     They are relying on the support of Marghiloman and important Conservative landholders of his party, such as Mr Grigorie Cantacuzino, who have always dreaded the victory of the Entente Powers as likely to mean the end of their influence in Rumania. These boyars are much attracted by the possibility of the victory of the Central Powers, which would either secure them their lands now threatened by the legislation passed last June by the Rumanian Parliament, or at least, should this prove impossible in face of the peasants&apos; demand, would offer them handsome compensation. Secondly, there are the mass of the peasants, both those who have stayed behind and those who are with the Rumanian army.     It would be quite in keeping with the double-minded character of German policy for the German authorities to promise and execute a far-reaching re-distribution of land in Rumania on condition of Rumania agreeing to peace
The reforms of the Bratianu Government, even if they are fully known in Wallachia,.are open to the double charge of being on the one hand inadequate and insincere (this was the nature of the attack made on them by Dr Lupufs Labour Party), and 6n the other of being impossible of attainment, since the Entente Powers will never secure a victory in South-Eastern Europe. The Germans, on the other hand, could offer an immediate distribution of land together with the tempting prospect of peace.     Land being the thing dearest to the peasant&apos;s heart, there is little doubt that the offer would be accepted.   The peasants of Wallachia and of Moldavia, if that too is evacuated, could be at once enriched by a division of the estates of the big landholders, the bulk of whom have left the occupied province.    A temptation almost too strong to resist would be presented to the Rumanian soldiers (supposing that they withdrew to the Cossack country).   It would be too much to hope that they would be content to stay in exile while the estates were divided among those who had remained behind in Wallachia.      The army would be demoralised by desertions and a definite cleavage between the Government and people established. In other respects too, Germany could offer Rumania the best of terms:   the immediate prospect of the renewal of economic inter-course on a big scale and a promise that at least part of Dobrogea, as well as Bessarabia, might still be theirs.     This is at best only a conjecture as to what shape German policy towards Rumania may shortly take, but it seems in many ways a probable one. If so, it might well be the best course for the Rumanian Government, in understanding with its Allies, to consent to a separate peaoe With the Central Powers in order that the Germans should havtj no opportunity of setting up in Rumania a Germanophil party with no counter-balance to it such as would be presented by the complete
return of the Rumanian army.    Further considerations as toGerman policy towards Rumania must be postponed till there are gaiorefacts to hand.The Rumanian Parliament.Meanwhile Parliament has reopened in lasi (December 30). The King, in the Speech from the Throne, struck the same note of determination as has been characteristic of him ever since Rumaniafs intervention in the war.    &quot;However heavy our sacrifices must be&quot;, he said, &quot;while waiting for the moment when we shall have attained the end of our legitimate aspirations, we are oonvinced that we shall see our recompense on the decisive day of the re-establishment of the reign of justice and Of freedom among the nations&quot;.    Ho allusion was made to the conclusion of the armistice,British pledges ton Rumania.The assurance to Rumania given by Sir Edward Carson on December 7 at the inaugural meeting of the Anglo-Rumanian Society of &quot;the determination of this Government that we will go on to the end with you until we have each attained the common object for which we have entered into this war&quot; had the most encouraging effect on Rumanian opinion.   This pledge is now renewed by Mr Lloyd George in his demand for &quot;the restoration of the occupiedparts of Rumania, .....the complete withdrawal of the alien armiesand the reparation for^justice done&quot; as a &quot;fundamental condition of permanent peace&quot;.    Further, the case of the oppressed Rumans of Austria-Hungary is dealt with (1) in the demand for the grant of &quot;genuine self-government on true democratic principles to those Austro-Hungarian nationalities who have long desired It&quot;, and
L in(2) in the assurance &quot;we also mean to press that justice be done to men of Rumanian blood and speech in their legitimate aspirations&quot;.     This demand agrees fundamentally in principle and would almost&apos; certainly be found to agree In fact with the natural and logical solution of the question, namely, the union of the whole Rumanian race on the basis of self-determination, which Is the aspiration alike of free Rumanians and Rumans of Hungary.It is v/orth nothing that in his wireless message of December 29 Mr Trotski specifically alludes to the question of Rumanian Irredenta.     He attacks the Central Powers fpr &quot;having the idea that the old annexations and the old violences over the people are sanctioned by historic prescription.   This means that the destinies of Alsace-Lorraine, Trarisilvania ....  should not be subject to revision.     Such a programme is profoundly inconsequent&quot;,     This allusion is all the more satisfactory inasmuch as the Rumanian question has been a most unpopular one in Russia - both in Tsarist and Socialist circles, for different reasons.8.1.18.
