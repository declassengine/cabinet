t,. r      INTRODUCTION. Report on the Year 1917.The year 1917 has been u period of far-reaching developments in our relations with our Allies abroad and in the organisation &apos;of the nation at home for the purposes of the war. At the present time only a brief and imperfect record of this complex period can be made, but the War Cabinet has considered that it would be useful to submit to Parliament, and through Parliament to the nation, a survey of the principal changes which are shaping the course of our policy and administration. The Report will at the same time serve to inform the nation more fully as to the heavy responsibilities which are being placed upon the adminis-trative services and which require the most complete co-operation and goodwill of the public for their effectual discharge.Abroad, the period under review has been marked by many important developments.    But two events stand out pre-eminently the Revolution in Russia and the Declaration of War against Germany by the United States of America.   Already in 1917 the effects of these mighty events are being felt.    The Revolution in Russia, so great in its possibilities, has by the end of the year resulted in an armistice with the Central Powers. The entry of the United States of America, on the other hand, has brought an access of moral and material strength to the cause of the A]lies, the importance of which it would be difficult to over-estimate, and which is making itself felt throughout the inter-Allied organisation military, naval and economic.   The abdication of King Coristantine and the restoration of constitu-tional government in Greece marks another notable event in this year.    Greece, under the leadership of M. Venizelos, is now actively supporting the Allies against the Central Powers. Lastly, the year 1917 has witnessed a remarkable-movement among the neutral nations&apos; outside Europe.   Cub,a, Brazil, Panama, Siamr Liberia, and China have. declared themselves at war with Germany, while Bolivia,  Guatemala, Honduras,  Nicaragua, Hayti, Santo Domingo, Costa Rica, Peru, and Uruguay have broken off relations with Germany.: These events mark the grow-ing recognition of the present struggle as the fight for world freedom, and prepare the way for stronger and more permanent international arrangements.   But they also have an immediate influence on the Allied power of economic pressure.   As, under the strain of war, the world&apos;s production falls, the control of raw materials and food becomes an increasingly powerful factor. By reason of the. access of so. many. States to the side of the15005-16,16, 12, 20 A
tAllies, not only has it been possible to tighten considerably the blockade of enemy countries, but by greater control over supplies to neutrals there has been a more effective insurance against diversion of materials from neutral States to the assistance and comfort of the enemy.In considering the progress of the Allied cause, the most important factor is the mutual agreement of the Allies as to the &apos; aims for which they are fighting. The common Aims Of the purpose is the bond of union among the Allies. Allies. &apos; Changes of Government have marked no change in aims. The aims of the Allies are constant and unabated. Their fundamental demands are, first, restora-tion of the full autonomy of nations whose territories have been invaded by the Central Powers; second, reparation for losses and sufferings wrongfully inflicted; third, securities for the fust rights of nations and nationalities and for the maintenance of inter-national agreements. The Allies are bound together in the fixed determination not to relax their efforts until these objects have been secured, and they recognise clearly that these aims can be firmly secured only if German military power is overthrown.During 1917 the bonds of the Alliance have grown stronger as the straggle has become more severe.   This is one of the mostsignificant developments of the year. Never Inter-Ally before have the principles of common action Co-operation,   been so widely accepted.   The constitution ofthe Supreme War Council of the Allies, sitting at Versailles, is only the culmination of a process which has been steadily progressing since the war began and which is destined to have most far-reaching effects not only in diplomatic and military spheres, but also in political and economic organisation and rela-tioriships. More and more inter-allied co-operation is dealing not only with war aims and with military and naval dispositions, but with the control of shipping, raw materials, food and other essen-tial commodities. The practical necessity for economic co-operation is supplanting the older ideas of separate interests and economic competition. The full consequences of this develop-ment cannot yet be foreseen, but the present movement gives ground for hope that the mutual assistance of the Allies to one another in tbeApurchase /production) and distribution of supplies, with the machinery of inter-ally control, will continue in the period of reconstruction. The joint military and naval Councils and the various inter-ally Executives for purchase and allocation of supplies are the outward evidence of the growing solidarity of the Allies, but there, is an awakening consciousness of an even deeper solidarity which recognises that the burden must be shared by each according to his strength and that supplies must be distributed proportionately to all according to their needs. There is an obligation to share equally with the Allies in the common shortage of food and other necessaries and to face the future in the spirit of full comradeship. This is part of the inner mean-ing of 1917 to us and to our Allies, and this fact has influenced, and must influence still more deeply, our organisation for and
our contribution to -the war. The weakness of the Alliance in the past has been to a -large extent measured by the -limitations in the acceptance of this principle. 1917 has marked a great advance, and its significance should be carefully studied.A second principle of this inter-allied solidarity the conse-quences of which have become clearer during the past year-is that the nation shall give its whole strength to the common task. Each State has more and more to control its resources with a view to their maximum value in the common cause of the Allies. Accordingly, in 1917, there has been an intensification of effort and a more complete mobilisation of national reserves. This has involved a steadily increasing measure of control over man-power, over mines, shipping, railways, industrial supplies, over the pro-duction and distribution of food, and over finance. . The supplies of the world have become more straitened, the resources of men more exhausted, the demands on all kinds of reserves more com-plete. Each nation is therefore being called upon to adjust its organisation and its economy to a much more stringent set of war conditions.We have thus entered on a&quot; period of fuller national control, for, under conditions of supply as they now are, control is neces-sary both to national economy and to fair dealing between individual and individual. The problem is one of great com-plexity and difficulty; here and there mistakes may be made in the form of control, but stage by stage the machinery of pro-duction and distribution is being adjusted to the new regime.Before proceeding to the achievements of the Naval, Military and Civil services, attention should be directed to two importantconstitutional changes which have taken place in the Constitu- past year. The first of these is the institution of tional the War Cabinet. Experience proved that the Changes.    Cabinet as it had developed in peace time was nota body suited to carry out the direction of a war of. the present intensity and magnitude. Nor did the creation of a War Committee of the Cabinet prove a change sufficient to deal with the exigencies of the situation. In the unprecedented circumstance of the times it was essential to relieve those who were charged with the supervision and direction of war policy and organisation from departmental responsibilities. The War Cabinet was accordingly constituted, consisting of the Prime Minister and, at first, of four,-and later of six Ministers, with two exceptions (the Lord President, of the Council and the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer), without portfolio. The Cabinet so constituted meets, as a rule, five days in the week. Ministers in charge of Departments attend the Cabinet when questions affecting their Departments or in regard to which they have special experience are being considered, but- the responsibility for decisions on general policy rests with the War Cabinet. The War Cabinet has its secretariat, and Minutes of Cabinet proceed-ings are-recorded and reported to the Departments concerned. The system of the War Cabinet, while it marks in. many respects15005 A 2
an important departure from the methods of. the Cabinet system as it was, has grown out of the needs of the times, and is a constitutional development in accord with the principles of responsible government.Tke second constitutional development of the past year to which reference should be made &quot;has been the institution of the Imperial War Cabinet. Shortly after assuming office in December, 1916, an invitation was issued to the Governments of the British Overseas Dominions asking that the Prime Minister, or his specially accredited representative, should take part in special sessions of the War Cabinet, for the purpose of considering the policy of the Empire in the war. The Govern-ment of India was at the same time invited to send representa-tives, a step in the development of Imperial representation which was warmly approved in India and throughout the Empire. The Imperial War Cabinet met on the 20th March, 1917, and continued its sessions until the 2nd May. This consti-tutional experiment proved of such -service that at the last 1 session of the Imperial War Cabinet it was resolved unanimously that meetings should be held annually or at any intermediate time when matters of urgent Imperial concern required to be settled.The visit of the Prime Ministers and other representatives from overseas was also made the occasion of an Imperial War Con-ference at which various important questions of present and future Imperial relationship were considered. The proceedings of this Conference, which met at the Colonial Office under the Presidency of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, have been presented to ParliamentOn sea, on land and in the air the year has borne constant evidence of the determined spirit of our fighting forces, and Pailiament has recently given expression to the Naval and    feelings of pride and gratitude which are shared Military       by the whole Empire.Operations, On sea, despite an unrestricted and merciless submarine campaign, the lines of communication have everywhere been maintained. The enemy have strained their efforts to increase greatly the number and power of their submarine craft. Birt the counter-offensive measures of our Navy have resulted in the increasing destruction of enemy sub-marines, while, thanks to the unceasing vigilance of the patrols and to the organisation of the convoy system, the losses to our merchantmen and also to Allied and neutral shipping entering British ports have shown a very marked decline as the year advanced. During the last six months of the year the gross loss of British tonnage has been much.less than in the first six months, and the last quarter has been the best quarter of the year. . .The maintenance of the effective strength of the Fleet has been recognised by this as by preceding Governments as the first charge on the nation&apos;s power.   The strength of the Navy at the
end of 1917 is substantially greater than it was at the-beginning of the year, but its labours have also increased, and at no time has there been so great a call for unceasing watchfulness. There has been an ever-growing, co-operation with the fleets of our Allies, and this.year has seen the relief of our Fleet in the Atlantic by the Navy of the United States of America, while, in addition to valuable service rendered in Eastern Waters, Japanese war vessels have joined with those of France, Italy and ourselves in policing the Mediterranean. -The establishment of the Allied Naval Council marks a further step in securing con-certed action among the Allies in maintaining the safety of the seas.On land, the year has witnessed an advance on many fronts of war by our forces. On the Western front they have won from the enemy important strategic positions; they have recovered 670 square miles and have captured 73,131 prisoners and 531 guns. The British forces have during the year extended ^their lines in France, and have thus been able to&quot; give further relief to our valiant Allies.At Salonica there has been little change in the situation, but the presence of the Allied forces has enabled Greece to take her stand with the Allies. &apos; In Italy, fFrench and British forces have hastened to assist in withstanding the attack of the Central Powers. - In Mesopotamia the yeaf has witnessed the.recovery of Kut-el-Amara, and the advance-to and capture &quot;of Bagdad. In Palestine &quot;our forces-at the beginning of the. year were before El-Arish; at the close of the year, with Jerusalem liberated, they are. still advancing. In East Africa a strenuous campaign, covering an area of 80,000 square miles, has resulted in the cap-ture of a&apos;large part of the German forces,- and has driven the enemy out of his territory. During 1917, on all British fronts, 115,000 prisoners and 781 guns have been captured.The strength of the Army has risen by 16 per cent, in the course of the year, and the strength in the fighting line by 33 per cent. There has been considerable development in the organisation of supplies, in the medical equipment of the forces and in transport, particularly through the extension of military railways.In the air, this year has been one of exceptionally hard fighting and endurance. The total number of enemy machines brought down during the year amounted to 876, while 759 others were driven down or out of control. The greatly increased output of aircraft and the wide extension of training schools has enabled a large addition to be. made to the number of squadrons. The menace of the Zeppelin attacks, which were repeated in the earlier part of the year, has been met, and the home defence against enemy aircraft has been greatly strengthened. Very important service has been rendered during the past year by the Air Board, but with a view to the most complete co-ordination of effort in the Naval and Military Air Services, and the maxi-mising of output, a Ministry of Air has been recently established.
Closely connected with the efficiency of the fighting services on sea, on land and in the ah has been the work of the Ministry .pfMunitions. During the past year output Munitions.    has been steadily increased.   Despite large con-signments to other fronts of war, there has been an increase of 30 per cent, in all kinds of guns and howitzers, and of over 100 per cent, in heavy guns and howitzersin .the recent offensives in France, as compared with the Somme. The weight of shell filled per month this year is considerably over double that of last year. The output of high explosives has enabled us not only to meet the increased demands for our own requirements, but to build up stocks, and at the same&apos; time to allocate substantial quantities to our Allies. There has been a steady improvement in the detonating value of gun ammunition, and a marked reduction in the number of premature explosions of shells. The output of rifles and small arms from British sources is now sufficient to cover requirements; the monthly output of machine guns is over 60 per cent, greater than at the end of 1916. There have also been notable increases during the year in the output of aircraft, of tanks, of mechanical transport and of railway material and equipment.The results of these increased supplies have been seen in the offensives of the past year. A great saving of life has been effected by the thoroughness of the artillery preparations, by the increased use of aircraft and of tanks, and by the extended transport facilities which have given not only security of supplies, but additional mobility to our forces.There were, however, other problems of great urgency which faced the Government of this country at the end of 1916.   First,there was the problem of man-power and of the National relations of the State to Labour; second, there was Service.     the question of transport; third, there was thesupply and distribution of food. In all these matters the situation was critical.In the case of man-power, the requirements of the army and of the industries essential either to the equipment of the fighting forces or to the maintenance of the civil community had to be adjusted. In August, 1916, in view of the competing claims of different services on the man-power resources of the country, a Man-Power Distribution Board had been established. The ques-tion of compulsory national service had been considered, and one of the first questions which the present Government had to deal with was whether a system of compulsory national service should be introduced. In view of the importance of securing greater control over the demands of the different sevices, a Director-General of National Service was appointed, and it was decided in the first instance that an effort should be made to maintain the voluntary system in industry. A campaign for securing a supply of voluntary labour which could be transferred from less to more essential industries was carried out during February and March, but, owing partly to difficulties in withdrawing labour from the
great war industries to the Army and partly to the staie of the supply of labour which was found to be available, only a very limited number of the volunteers could-be substituted. In the case of agriculture, and also in forestry and in iron ore mining, in all of which additional labour was urgently required, the Department of National Service rendered valuable service by organising supplies of soldier, civilian and foreign labour. In-vestigations were carried out as to the supply of labour in different trades, and Trade Committees representing employers and employed were organised to deal with economy of man-power in particular industries. The evidence thus obtained in the voluntary campaign demonstrated clearly the complexity and difficulty of a system of compulsory national service in industry. At the same time the growing urgency of the problem of making the best use of the man-power of the country emphasized the necessity of maintaining the National Service Department and of extending rather than restricting its operations: The fact that recruiting had remained with the War Office and that the Employment Exchanges were under the Ministry of Labour weakened the essential control of the National Service Depart-ment. Accordingly, in August, 1917, the Department was reorganised, recruiting transferred from the War Office and the Employment Exchanges placed at the disposal of the National Service Department for the period of the war. At the same time the relations of the Department to other branches of the public service were reconsidered so as to bring about more complete co-ordination of work. These changes have been justified. Greater unity of direction in the supply of man-power has been secured, while the transference of recruiting, including control over medical examination, has increased confidence in the admin-istration of the Military Service Acts. But the problem of man-power remains one of the most complex as it is also the most vital problem for the State in war-time, and the Department of National Service is essential to the direction and realisation, of a national policy. Meanwhile, munitions, shipbuilding, agri-culture, transport and other essential services have been main-tained and in some cases their labour supply strengthened, while increasing restrictions have been imposed on less essential industries. This policy, which requires great care in its direc-.&apos; fcion, is being steadily developed by the Ministry of National Service with the co-operation both of employers and employed.A wide appeal has been made during the year for additional women workers, and tribute must be paid to the valuable service rendered to the State by women in a very large and increasing number of occupations.Closely connected with the problem of man-power is that of the relations of the State to Labour and the question of IndustrialDnrest. The State has become by far the greatest Labour,   employer. &apos; At the outbreak of war, the Governmenthad taken over the railways of Great Britain, and at the beginning of 1917 State control was extended to the Irish railways.   The coal mines and the iron mines have also been
taken &quot;over for ibe period of the war; while, to an increasing degree, other, important industries of the country have been brought under Government control. At.no time has it been of such national importance that the relations between employers and employed and between the State and Labour should be based on good mutual understanding. A more adequate representation of labour in the system of government was required, and one of the first acts of the present adminis-tration- was to establish a Ministry of Labour, the demand for which had been repeatedly voiced by organised labour. The Ministry of National Service is a Department created to deal with a special problem of the war period; the Ministry of Labour is a permanent Department of State charged with duties which will become even more important in the period after the war. To this Ministry were transferred the functions of the Industrial Commissioner with the duties of arbitration and con-ciliation in trade disputes, the control of the Employment Exchanges, of Unemployment Insurance, of the administration of the Trade Boards Act, and of the collection of labour statistics and information.Other steps taken during the past year have been the estab-lishment of Agricultural Wages Boards respectively for England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland; tho onquiricc of the Com-ol ^K^rj^missioh^into Industrial Unrest; the Munitions of War Act, 1917, and the adoption of the Whitley Report; with a&apos;view to the . development of Industrial Councils representative of employers and employed. These measures are one and all efforts to get at the roots of industrial unrest. But much still remains to be done. The common strain and the sacrifices of war have made possible a better understanding between all parts of the com-munity, and it is not only a problem of the future, but an urgent duty of the present to improve the relations of our industrial life. The- Government would therefore lay special stress upon the importance of carrying into effect immediately the recommenda-tions of the Whitley Report.The second immediate problem with which the Government was faced at the end of 1916 was that of the increasing shortage ofshipping and the need for additional provision of Transport, ships.   Three ways of attacking the problem wereadopted : first, better economy in-the. use of avail-able ships; second, an increased shipbuilding programme; and third, an extended policy of restriction of imports.First, the appointment of a Controller of Shipping and the establishment of a Ministry of Shipping have resulted in a much more complete control of shipping than was otherwise obtainable. The&apos;concentration of our shipping on the shortest routes from which supplies could be obtained, increased attention to the full use of carrying capacity, and expedition in the turn round of ships at the ports have brought about the remarkable result that, despite the heavy submarine losses, our imports in quantity
daring-the months-of&apos;September, October and November have been equal to those.of February, March and April. The last six months of this year have seen as much imported as the first six months. This achievement is the more remarkable as, during the last six months of 1917, the &quot; convoy &quot; system has been widely adopted; and while this practice ensures greater safety to our merchant shipping, it involves a certain amount of delay to individual ships.At the end of 1916 the proportion of tonnage which had been requisitioned by the State was less than one half of.the whole, and was used to a large extent for the military and naval services and for our Allies. Practically the whole of the remainder of the British ocean-going mercantile marine has now been brought under requisition at Blue-book rates and is used for the most urgent services of the nation, and of our Ailing, In this connection it should be borne in mind also that a considerable part of our shipping has been allocated to the service of our Allies. British ships with a gross tonnage of over 1,000,000 tons are in the service of France, and ships with a gross total tonnage of nearly 500,000 tons are in the service.of Italy; while, in addition, shipping has been provided to assist in meeting the needs of Russia, Portugal and Greece. It should also.be remembered that a large percentage of British mercantile tonnage is absorbed in the supply of naval and military requirements. .Second, apart from economy in the use of ships, it was essen-tial to increase the provision for the replacements of shipping tonnage. An immediate survey was takon of the capacity of home shipyards, and, with a. view to expedition, plans were approved for the supply of standard ships. Steps were taken to secure the purchase of a considerable quantity of shipping from Allied and neutral Powers, and orders were placed for the construction of a large number of ships. During- the year difficulties in the supply of steel plates and the shortage of labour have delayed production, but it is steadily rising. In private shipyards 45 new berths have been approved and in three new national shipyards 34 berths are in process of construction: The scale of existing operations may be indicated by the fact that, apart from a very large amount of ship repairing, the total output of new tonnage of warships and merchant vessels in the last quarter of 1917 is at a rate of 18 per cent, per annum higher than in 1913, the record year of output. Every effort will be made in 1918 to exceed greatly this production, m as to mako good tho loaoco ofThird, in connection with the economic use of shipping, it was immediately resolved by the Government to extend considerably the policy of the restriction of imports. A Committee of Enquiry-was appointed, and as a result of its recommendations a policy of additional restrictions came into operation on March 1st, 1917, involving; when the system bad been&apos;., fully established, a saving, additional to previous restrictions, at the rate of 6,000,000 tons
per annum, which was afterwards increased to 0,000,000 tone by-4 severe restrictions of imports of timber. The object of this policy was to secure priority to the most essential supplies, to support the rates of exchange by the restriction of purchase abroad, and to advance national economy by reduction of the supply of less essential articles. In the nine months-March to -November-the imports of the restricted articles have been reduced te an amount equal to a saving at the rate of between seven and eight million tons per annum as compared with the. preceding year.While these measures were adopted to regulate the supplies of .-overseas transport, steps were taken to relieve congestion at the ports and to control more strictly railway and canal traffic.   The influence of submarine warfare on the distribution of traffic at the ports has a very important reaction on the internal railway problem.   This has been successfully overcome by the Railway Executive Committee, while restrictions on passenger traffic which were introduced in January, 1917, and the important ,reorganisation by the Coal Controller of the distribution of coal, involving an economy in carriage of 700,000,000 railway ton miles, have contributed largely to the solution of a very urgent ,.and complex problem.One other feature of this side of national reorganisation should be noted. Concurrently with the restriction of imports the policy was adopted of increased development of home resources. A Timber Controller was appointed to increase the available supply of home-grown timber and to manage the now severely restricted imports of timber. Steps were also taken by the Minister of Munitions to increase the output of iron ore, and work was begun on several new ore deposits. At the same time attention was directed to increasing the supplies of British oils, and a much more stringent control over supplies has been established. Wherever possible the policy has been adopted of increasing -home production.This problem was of particular importance in dealing with the urgent problem of the nation&apos;s food supplies.Pood Pro- At the close of the year 1916 the outlook withduction and regard to the supply of food was a matter of Control.        great anxiety.  The reserves of wheat were lowerthan at any corresponding period during the war;there was a visible shortage also of sugar and of potatoes. The area under corn crops had declined in 1916 as compared with 1915, and the returns of winter wheat at the beginning of December indicated a greater decline in acreage in 1917. There was too the prospect that the world&apos;s production would be insufficient, or at least unavailable, to meet the demand. Accordingly, a two-fold policy was adopted. On the one hand, a campaign for increased production of home-grown food was immediately set on foot, and, on the other hand, a Pood Con-troller was appointed and a Ministry of Food established. In dealing with the problem of increased home production of food,
The question of.the control of food supplies has proved to be no less pressing. There are three mam problems which the Ministry of Pood had to face : Pirst, the maintenance of supplies ; second, the control of prices; and third, the regulation of distribu--tion. With regard to the first and most fundamental of these problems, the Ministry of Pood has collected very much more complete information than was hitherto available as to stocks of food, as to the rate of consumption, and to the prospects of future supplies. This is fundamental. At the end of the year 1916 much the most serious question was the state of the supplies of breadstuffs. Steps were taken promptly by the Food Con-troller to raise the percentage of milling of wheat and to require dilution with other cereals, while provision was made for increased imports. At the same time a campaign for economy in the use of bread was set on foot and a voluntary ration was announced. As a result, at the beginning of the winter of 1917 the supplies of wheat were.3,000,000 quarters higher than in the-the first essential was to increase the confidence and stimulate the energy of the farmers and&apos;&quot;the agricultural labourers. The Corn Production Act gave to the farmer increased security&apos;as regards prices, to the agricultural labourer a minimum wage, and to the State increased control over the cultivation of land. Despite the late period of the year the campaign for increased production has resulted in an increase of over one million acres in the area of corn and potatoes in the United Kingdom, and the returns of produce of crops show that the supply of home-grown cereals has been increased by over 850,000 tons, the yield per acre being very similar to that of 1916, while, helped by most favourable conditions, the potato crop exceeds that of 1916 by more than 3,000,000 tons. In addition to these supplies, the large increase in urban and rural allotments and in the use of gardens for vegetables has greatly extended the supply of food and has-economised distribution. At the same time steps were taken to provide for a greatly increased arable area in the United Kingdom in 1918, and strenuous efforts are being made to secure an additional 3,000,000 acres of food crops. In order to carry out these programmes of increased home production, it was neces-sary to secure more labour,for the land, to provide for a great increase of tractor and other machinery, and to obtain a maximum supply of fertilisers. The War Office has assisted by releasing skilled ploughmen and supplying unskilled and semi-skilled labour, and the Ministry of Munitions has given valuable co-operation by undertaking the control of the manufacture and supply of agricultural machinery and also of fertilisers. The campaign for increased home production has thus made good progress. There is a new outlook on the land and on the duty of its cultivation, which is in itself a great asset. But much still remains to be done, and the work so far well begun requires a great extension in the interest of national security.
corresponding period of 1916, and the nation &apos;s reserves of bread-stuffs were in a more satisfactory position than at any time since the outbreak of war. During the year the Wheat Executive-which had hitherto controlled imports of wheat and maize-ex-tended its control to all cereals; the flour mills were brought under control of the Ministry of Food, and the use. of wheat, barley and maize for animal food was restricted within narrow limits. The serious shortage, however, of the French and Italian harvests and the needs of our other Allies have placed a heavy demand on the limited available supplies of wheat, and strict economy must be maintained so that the position of our Allies, to whom part of our supplies have already been diverted, may be secured. Control has been extended during the year to almost all imported foodstuffs, and these are now purchased by the Ministry of Food on the national account. Purchase is to an increasing extent carried out in concert with our Allies through Inter-Ally Executives. While the State has thus taken over the purchase and control of imported supplies, an increasing measure of control has been established over home-grown cereals, meat and dairy produce. This has become more necessary in order to secure effective control over prices and over distribution. ;The control of prices has received the constant attention of the Ministry of Food throughout the year. With the exception of milk and potatoes, this country depends on imports for a consider-able part of its supply of the main articles of food. Prices are determined by the state of the world&apos;s markets, and the control over prices which can be exercised in this country is thus limited. But by means of a wide extension of joint purchases with our Allies in the world market, by control of freights, by fixing of maximum prices to the home producer and of wholesale and retail charges, effective steps have been taken to check the undue rise of prices and to secure the elimination of profiteering in the main articles of consumption. In view of the seriousness of the high cost of bread, special action was taken by the Government in September, and the price of the 4-lb. loaf was fixed at a maximum of 9d. the Exchequer bearing the loss on sale.The third problem which has engaged the attention of the Ministry of Food is that of distribution. The difficulties of the problems of rationing are well known, and so long as there is no serious shortage of essential commodities the disadvantages&apos;of rationing are greater than the advantages. But in certain articles of consumption particularly sugar and fats the supply is, and is likely to remain, considerably below the normal demand, while circumstances may bring about a shortage in other not less essential commodities. In such a case rationing is the only method of securing equitable and economic distribution. In order to deal with the situation, Statutory Local Food Committees have been set up and wide.powers have been conferred upon them with regard to the control-&apos;and distribution of supplies, the modifica-tibn of prices and the provision of communal arrangements. Local officers of the Ministry of Food have been appointed to assist the Central Department in carrying out its responsibilities
to the-Local Statutory Committees. An organisation, central and local, has thus been built up which makes possible an effective control over food supplies and prices.In connection with the economy of food, steps were taken, during the past year to restrict further the consumption of spirits and beer. Except for certain special purposes, the manufacture of spirits has been forbidden. The manufacture of beer has been reduced from 26,000,000 barrels to 14,000,000 barrels, and regu-lations have been made as to strength and price. The questions of prohibition and of State Purchase have been carefully examined, and Committees have been appointed respectively for England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, to report on the finance of State Purchase in these several countries.The foregoing have been urgent questions of production and supply.   But steps have been taken during the past year to makemore satisfactory provision for the care and well-Pensions,    being of those who have a special claim on the State.In view of the growing importance of the problems of war pensions, the Government, in December, 1916, established a Ministry of Pensions, to which were transferred the duties relating to war pensions as discharged by the Admiralty, the Chelsea Commissioners and the Army Council. Subsequently also the functions of the Statutory War Pensions Committee were handed over to the Pensions Ministry. The Ministry has revised policy with regard to pensions in two main directions first, the monetary scale of pensions has been increased and the conditions attached to them have been widened, so as to effect a more liberal recognition of the country&apos;s debt to its defenders; second, the principle of compensation has been supplemented by a policy which aims at restoration. It is thus the aim of the Ministry not simply to make compensation for loss or injury, but to endeavour to restore men as completely as possible to health and service. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken within its view the con-, tinuing medical treatment of the discharged man and his training-and equipment for occupation in life. Remarkable success has attended the medical and educational restorative work which has. thus been co-ordinated and extended by the Ministry of Pensions in concert with other departments and public institutions.In education, the year has been one both of achievement and of preparation of far-reaching plans. The President of the Board of Education in England and Wales has secured Education,. the assent of Parliament providing for the better remuneration of teachers attd of a more equitable distribution of charges between the central and local authorities, while.&apos; a; far-reaching measure of great national importance, abolishing half-time, raising the school age to 14 years, and pro-&apos; viding for compulsory half-time education up to 18 years of age has been submitted to the House of Commons. i
In Public Health, a wide-spread change of great importance to the welfare of the nation has been taking place in the industrial sphere. Evidence of this may be seen in the Public development of very valuable work in industrial Health. administration inaugurated by the HealthyMunition, Workers Committee, in the Welfare Orders issued by the Home Office and in the wide extension of the canteen system, not only among munition workers but also among factory and workshop employees outside munitions.In the vital matter of housing, a careful survey of the problem has been made, particulars of requirements have been obtained from Local Authorities in England and Wales and Scotland, and the Government have, promised to give substantial financial assistance in carrying out approved schemes as soon as it,is possible to secure labour and material for the purpose. In. the meantime several emergency schemes have been put into Operation.. These are all questions which are part of the wider problem of reconstruction, and special reference must be made to the action taken during the past year in this very important Recon- matter. Reconstruction is not simply a post-war. Strnction. problem beginning with demobilisation. It is cbn-cemed also with developments which can be effected even during the war for the well-being and strength of the nation. An illustration of this may be seen in the case of the Whitley Report a report of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed which was issued during the past year, was adopted by the Government and is being carried into effect during the war; so also: the Report of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee on Agricultural Policy formed the basis for the Corn Production Act of the past Session. Reconstruction is thus a task of the present as well as of the future  it&quot;is not simply a scheme of things, but a process of develop-ment and the results of the enquiries which have been and are being made are, in at least some instances, capable of immediate realisation atid contribute to the efficiency of the nation in war-time as well as to its future strength. Other most important problems of reconstruction which will arise immediately with the arrival of peace such as demobilisation, not only of the fight-ing forces but also of many of the war industries, and the supply of raw materials require plans to be thought out ahead and the machinery for their execution to be in readiness.: Prior to 1917 there had been a Reconstruction Committee, consisting of members of the Cabinet, with a number of important Sub-Committees. In March, 1917, the Government constituted a general Committee to review the field of reconstruction, and valuable assistance was given by this Committee and by the Reconstruction Sub-Committees which have been carrying on
investigations into special questions. Later, in July, the.Govern-ment considered the time had come when, for the purpose of the more, thorough prosecution and co-ordination of the work, a Ministry of Reconstruction was required, and a Bill was passed by Parliament authorising the appointment of a Minister of Reconstruction with powers not only to institute enquiries and prepare schemes, but also to have &quot; such powers and duties of any Government Department or authority, which have been con-ferred by or under any Statute, as His Majesty may by Order in Council authorise the Minister to exercise or perform, con-currently with, or in consultation with the Government Depart-ment or authority concerned.&quot; The establishment of a Ministiy thus secures not only that schemes are prepared, but that steps are taken to secure conference and co-ordinated action with the several Departments or public authorities concerned, and that provision is made for the exercise of powers necessary to the work-ing of any scheme. This is a sphere of responsibility wider than belongs to a Committee, and the establishment of a Ministry thus advances the important work of translating reports into action. The Minister of Reconstruction has established an Advisory Council to assist him in the task of surveying and deter-mining priority in the very extensive field of work, and the Ministry has been organised in four main divisions, viz. : (1) Production, including commerce, supply of materials, trans-port and finance; (2) Labour and industrial organisation; (3) Rural development; (4) Social development, including Health, Housing and Education.The establishment of a Department of Reconstruction, with a Minister responsible to Parliament, brings the subject openly before the public. Reconstruction is not work which should be done in secret. The issues are such as require the fullest public consideration and the common education of national thought. For reconstruction is not a policy of restoring things as they were, but of creating a new and better order. The experience which has been gained as to our internal organisation must not be lost; the deeper sense of social obligation which has been awakened must find its expression in a nation united no less in peace than in war, and our national life must be adjusted to the wider international relationships of a progressive society.The National effort in 1917 must also be measured in one other field of administrative control, viz., finance.   The serviceof this country to the Allied cause has been not Finance.     simply that of men, ships and munitions, but alsoof money. The great increase in our fighting forces adds to the burden of expenditure which has to be carried, but it diminishes also the productive strength of the nation. In such circumstances the strictest economy becomes necessary, and to give to the State the fullest possible financial support is one of the most important national services. During the year two great appeals for money have been made by the Government. In January a new War Loan was issued, and realised the un-precedented total of over  1,000,000,000. In October the issue of National War Bonds commenced, and offered&apos;a means by which&quot;
the nation can steadily, week by week, support the financing bf the war. The results have been encouraging, and by the end&apos;of December a total of over  210,000,000 had been-reached..r: In the flotation both of the War Loan and of the National&apos;War Bonds&apos; the Government have received very valuable assistance ,from the War Savings Associations and the Local Authorities; as well as from the Banks and Stock Exchanges &quot;throughout the country. In respect of taxation, the most notable feature of the year has been the raising of the tax on war profits from 60; per cent, to 80 per cent. In external finance, the entry of the United States into the war has:brought a great access of financial strength to the cause of the Allies, and important developments have taken place in the organisation of Inter-Ally financial arrangements. &apos;Finally, the year has seen a number of developments in the political sphere to which reference must be made.The Bepresentation of the People Bill, a measure based on the agreement of all parties, marks one of the most notable consti-tutional changes in modern times.The success which attended the Conference on Electoral Reform, presided over by the Speaker, has been followed by the appointment of a Joint Committee, consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament, to enquire and report on the nature and limitations of the legislative powers to be exercised by the re-formed Second Chamber; the best mode of adjusting differences between the two Houses of Parliament; and the changes which are desirable in order that the Second Chamber may in future be so constituted as to exercise fairly the functions appropriate to a Second Chamber.The Session has seen the setting up, with almost the unanimous approval of the House of Commons, of an Irish Convention, which has brought together in Ireland men of widely different aims for the purpose of framing a constitution for the better government of Ireland.The question of advancing the progress of self-government in India has also engaged the attention of Parliament. On August 20th a declaration of the policy of the Government was made to the House of Commons, in the following terms : &quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with which the Government of India is in complete accord, is that of the increasing associa-tion of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.&quot; At the same time it was announced that, on the invitation of the Viceroy of India and with the concurrence of the War Cabinet, the Secretary of State
for.;India:;was;to visit the Indian Dominions with a view to con-suiting the-Government of India as to the best method of giving , practical-effect-to-this policy.And in this connection the. declarations of policy in Mesopo-tamia and in Palestine may be recalled. The capture of Bagdad was followed by a declaration in which the British Government pledged itself to the restoration of the free institutions of the Arab civilisation, while in Palestine the liberation of Jerusalem was . preceded by the announcement that the British Government would seek to secure in Palestine a national home for the Jewish race, and thereby to satisfy the intense national sentiment which has marked the history of that people. These declarations are practical expressions of the principles which inspire the policy of the-Allies.i-jsoosB
