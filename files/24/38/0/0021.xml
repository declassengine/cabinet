North Sea.On December 23rd a Dover destroy er patrol engaged three large enemy destroyers Flanders off West Capelle at a range of 15,000 yards.   &quot; Swift&quot; was straddled several times but area, not hit, and after a few rounds from &quot; Swiftfs &quot; 6-inch guns, the enemy withdrew!-On December 27th enemy destroyers fired at our drifters off the Belgian coast, but failed to hit any of them, and the enemy withdrew under a smoke screen when a monitor opened fire. On the same day the shore batteries on the Belgian coast also opened fire on our patrol, but no damage was done.R.N.A.S. squadrons from Dunkirk have dropped about 4-ltons of bombs on Bruges docks and on aerodromes, at St. Denis Westrem and Grhistelles. At the latter place the aerodrome was observed to be lighted up.The drifter &quot;Annie,&quot; which grounded on the Turkish coast during the night of Mediter-December 19th-20th, as reported in last week&apos;s summary, has been destroyed by gunfire ranean. from the cruiser &quot; Endymion &quot; and the destroyer &quot; Ribble,&quot; as salvage was found to be impracticable.   The enemy brought down guns, apparently two 4-inch and six 12-pdrs.. with which a heavy fire was opened, bat this was kept down by &quot; Endymion,&quot; and our ships suffered no damage or casualties.The armed boarding steamer &quot; Grive,&quot; which was torpedoed by an enemy submarine Casualties, on December 8th -off the Shetland Islands and subsequently grounded, foundered on the 24th whilst being towed to a port for repair.   No lives were lost.The special service vessel &quot; Penshurst&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine off the Smalls on December 24th.The transport.&quot; Aragon,&quot; with over 2,000 troops on board, and the destroyer &quot;Attack,&quot; have been sunk clqse to the entrance to Alexandria; it is uncertain whether by mine or, torpedo. The losses in the &quot; Aragon&quot; are 2 officers killed and 5 missing, and of other ranks 90 killed and 365 missing ; 19 of the crew are also missing, making the total casualties 481. In addition to the troops there were 150 nurses on board the &quot; Aragon,&quot; all of whom were saved.   There are also 10 men missing from &quot; Attack.&quot;-    ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES, i.   :-. - *  \,&apos; . i    \During the week 19 or 20 large enemy submarines have been located, about 10 of Submarines which were operating to the westward of the British Isles and two (converted &quot; Deutsch- operating, land &quot; type vessels) Were working in the vicinity of the Azores and off the African coast south of the Canaries.  The area of greatest activity has again been the Irish Sea and the(C 879)   55   1/18   H&amp;Sl^ais Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,-]
English Channel. During the week there has been unusual submarine activity off the African coast between Oran and Algiers, which is within the French zone of operations.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and submarines. aiso the number of submarines destroyed: 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		December 8th.

The percentage of losses to sailings as regards overseas trades is this week 5.38 as compared with 1.57 last week. This large increase is accounted for not only by the fact that the tonnage1 engaged in these trades which was sunk this week amounts to 45,894 tons as against only 18,117 tons last week,.but also by a very large reduction in the total tonnage afloat, the outward sailings in overseas trades being only 358,083 tons in the week under review as against 706,533 in the previous week. This reduction is partly due to the Xmas holiday, but mainly to the fact that sailings were restricted on certain days of the week owing to the presence of enemy submarines and mines in the Irish Sea.The percentage of losses to sailings in Cross-Channel and Coasting traffic shows some Areas in improvement on last week, with the result that as regards all traffic the figure is this week which 1.94 as against .85 last week, and 1,08 the previous week. vessels lost.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas.The losses this week have again been mainly in Home Waters, but there was con-siderably more submarine activity in the xAtlantic than for several weeks past.ENEMY MINES.Minelaying activity during the week under review has been much greater than for some Minelaying. time past, mines having been laid in the Dover and Portsmouth areas, the Bristol Channel and in the approaches to Liverpool and Belfast, where the same submarine apparently laid half her cargo, i.e., nine mines, off each port. Submarine type mines have also been located in the North Sea about 40 miles east of Aberdeen, which is a new departure, as hitherto these mines have only been laid round the coast in positions which can be accurately fixed. The field in question was presumably aimed at the Scandinavian convoys and at Fleet movements between northern bases. This new minelaying policy on the part of the enemy creates a i difficult problem to meet, and emphasises the importance of the measures for the supply of paravanes and otters which are in force.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

Convoy. Of the former number, 245 were engaged in-the French coal trade, 149 on the Scandinavia  Lerwick Humber route, and the remaining 239 in overseas trade, 88 inward and 151 outward. There have been nine losses in convoy this week, one in inward convoy (from Dakar), four in outward convoy (one from Milford Haven, two from Lamlash and one in the England to Port Said convoy), one on the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber route and three engaged in the French coal trade.During the week 16 merchant vessels have been fitted to take primary armament, Defensive and 30 to take supplementary armament. armamenj.The net number of guns actually mounted in merchant ships as primary armament at December 29th was 2,140, and 89 howitzers as supplemental&apos;&apos; armament. The number of howitzers and bomb throwers delivered to date is 516. 1,076 merchant vessels have been fitted with Otter equipment. Mine pro-(C 879) A 2      tectiongear
MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Ten enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at and one has sailed from Nor-wegian ports outside the Cattegat. None have entered or left Rotterdam, but eight have during the week left Delfzyl for Sweden with enemy coal.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.iRussia.A Naval &quot;College &quot; is now in existence and has three members, viz., Admiral Ivanov (Minister of Marine), Duibenko (a torpedo gunner from the Baltic Fleet), and Personvalski (a bluejacket from the Black Sea Fleet). They are in supreme control of naval affairs, and have placed a &quot; Centro-flot&quot; (Fleet Committee) in supreme command in the Baltic, and have reduced the Commander-in-Chief to the position of Chief of Operations Section.;&apos; A Committee of 20 sailors has been appointed to carry out duties in regard to stores, finance and general administrative questions, and it is intended later to introduce two or three officers into this Committee.! Considerable friction exists between the &quot;College&quot; and the Committee.NAVAL STAFF,3rd January, 1918.[Appendices.
