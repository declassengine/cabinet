Gen. No,8/789.BAR QAtoET.Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Lands) Amendment Bill. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I dirdulate the following with reference to War Oabiiiet252 (5):-A question of importance has arisen in connection with the acquisition under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Aot 1916 of land upon which large works have been ereoted for War purposes at the publio expense.In many oases the effect of such expenditure has been,  : or will be, to increase very largely the value of the land in the &apos; immediate neighbourhood.     Within a few.months of the Government taking possession of land for the purpose of establishing -large works, adjoining land has been sold for a price largely in. excess :.\ of that which it commanded before the, intentions of the. Government -became kncwn. :&apos;Under the Aot the Government has power to acquire any land of which it is in possession, or upon which it has erected buildings, works or improvements, for war purposes, and also any adjoining or neighbouring land which appears to the Railway and Canal Commission to be required for the proper use and. enjoyment of the principal land (Sect. 3 (l) (&apos;2));* But it has ho power to acquire land merely because the value the retf has been enhanced by reason of the Government&apos;s expenditure on adjoining or neighbouring lancLIt is oonsidered that the Government ought to- have this latter power inasmuch as the improved value, in the case supposed, will have been entirely created by the expenditure of publio funds. It is true that under existing legislation the owner would be liable to pay the State one-fifth of the improved value by way of -increment Value duty, but this liability is not always easy to establish and, in any oase, the contribution can hardly be    ;  . considered adequate in a case where the iralue of land has risen from agricultural to high building rates within a year or two,., owing entirely to the expenditure of publio funds.Assuming the admission of the principle that the State : ought to be entitled to the improved value due to its own expenditure it is considered that the fairest method of giving effect thereto in the oases now under consideration is to empower the Government to acquire the land of which the value has been, or will be, improved, on the same terms with regard to compensation as those on which it is authorised to acquire land falling within the provisions of Sect, d (1) of the Acquisition of Land Act,   Tho Government would be entitled, that is to say, to acquire the land at its unimproved value and to realise the improved value by lease or sale, retaining such control as may be necessary in view of possible future expansion or development of the Government works.This method has the additional advantage oc? enabling the Government, to make ample provision for such possible future expansion and development.     The failure to make such provision has.s  &apos;   in
tin the past resulted in the Government haying to purchase land in the neighbourhood cf establishments like Aldershot at values largely created by its ov/n expenditure.It is necessary, of.course, that.there should be some tribunal %6 decide to what extent of land the powers in question shall apply in each partioular, case and it is proposed that this tribunal shall be the Railway and Canal Cocmission to whom the decision of many similar Questions is entrusted by the Act.In connection v/ith the establishment-of a National Shipbuilding&apos;,Yard at Chepstcw. the question has been raised, both in and.outside Parliamentj what steps the Government is taking to secure for the benefit of the State the inoreastf in the value of adjoining&apos;or neighbouring land which is bound to be created thereby;    A definite answer has so far been avoided, but the only definite answer that can be given is that no stepg are being taken because the Government has not got the necessary powers,;A clause to give the necessary powers has been drafted by -Parliamentary Counsel and is now inserted as clause E in.the bill to. Amend the Defence of&apos;the Realm (Acquisition of Lahd) A6ty. a copy of &quot;hieh is attached.   If the principle of the new clause, is approved by the &quot;&quot;ar Cabinet, it is proposed iiS submit it- with the rest of the Bill, id the Lord Chancellor.:     - DERBY.: 4th -January % 1918. \
