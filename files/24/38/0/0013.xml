Department of Information. SECRET. ffIW/023WEEKLY   REPORT   OK   ITALY. XXIII. (Jan. 4th. 1918)The Secret Sessions of the chamber which began on Deo. 13th, were not concluded until Dec 18th at 5 pm.   Oh the same day, after half an hours interval public sittings were resumed and continued until Dec. 28nd,We are now in a position to give a fuller account of the situation which declared itself during the Secret Sittings and of the resulting parliamentary position.For some mnnths past - ever since the speech delivered at Cuneo by Oiolitti in August - some sort of understanding between Oiolitti and the official Socialist leaders had been suspected and denounced by Interventionists, while an informal Alliance between Catholic Deputies and Giolittians dates from 1913.In August last the formation of the tfaione Pariaraentare   (oon-sisting largely of Oiolittian and Clerical Deputies) marked a certain insurrection of the majority against the dominance of Interventionism. While professing to be supporters of the war and to stand for defence of the rights of Parliament (legislation by decree and delegation of civil cowers to military authority) the new group was suspected of aiming at an eventual return of Oiolitti, or a nominee of Giolitti, to pswer with a policy of compromise alike in internal relations and in war-policy.The crisis of October represented a distinct gaining of ground for the opposition Coadition.     They regarded Orlando as their %an or at least as lkkely to lend himself in an Increasing degree t? their designs.     Orlando,hewseer, retained Baron Sonnino in the
Ministry, and his policy seemed to waver between ^Coneordia&apos; and Interventionism.     The demand prominently supported by the Unione Parlamentare for Parliamentary Commissions of Control heralded the inevitable attack on Sonnin* and the other heads of war-oolioy.     The Secret Session was aooepted in lieu of the Commissions but the attempt to get rid of Sonnino was not abandoned.Already in the forme 1 sitting of Nov. 14th Giolitti took up a neutral attitude and carefully abstained from committing himself to any unreserved sunport of the G6vernment.    At the same tine Signor Tittoni (Foriegn Minister at the ti&amp;e of the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and late Ambassador ftn Paris) had given notice of an interpellation involving criticism of the Foreign Minister and the question of Parliamentary Control.    He had for so Tie tine past been busy in enlisting supporters and had with him the most prominent of the Giolittians of the Senate.    At the initial open Sitting of the Chamber on Dec. 12th Sonnino, rising to present a Bill, was greeted with murmurs of hostility.     In the Secret Sitting of Dec 13th and the following days hostility to Sonnino and Cadorna was manifested in the most ostentatious and offensive manner, mainly by the Socialist left wing, Giolitti meanwhile remaining irnoassive.   There was talk apparently of forcing a vote before the end of the Secret Sessions, and the situation became so serious as to drive both Government and war-party to decided action.     A Cabinet Council was held (it is reported) on Dec 16th at which Baron Sonnino made to his colleagues a very afcle and thorough exposition of his whole policy and its motives, as a result of which Ministers unanimously decided to stand or fall with him.     On the same day the formation was announced of a league of National Defence numbering already some 120 Deputies and daily gain-ing new adherents from all quarters of the Ohamber united in a thoroughgoing prosecution of the war i;nd complete loyalty to the Allies. The league is the result of an organised Interventionist movement
which for some weeks past had been u gathering force in the country -its strongholds being Milan and Genoa - perhaps in prevision of the necessity for some such overawing of Parliament as took place in May 1915&apos;.At the subsequent sittings Orlando took up a very resolute attitude refuting calumnies regarding the Allies and repudiating vigorously all suggestion of a separate peace such as some groups seemed to desire.     (&quot;The Italians&quot;, he i3 reported to &apos; ave said, &quot;would retire fighting if necessary, as far as Sicily l t they would never give in&quot;) and declaring that the Government accepted full responsibility for the foreign policy of B*-ron Soneino.     (&quot;I would have everyone know that we all stand firmly and solidly united in accepting responsibility for what has been done and what will be done.     The foreign policy which has been adopted is that dictated by honour and the safety of the country&quot;).     Both during the Secret Sittings and during the public Sittings which followed Giolitti was challenged by different speakers to show hi a hand, but the invitation was obstinately refused. The Opposition would not commit itself to a frontal attack, but would wait upon events.     Events being obviously contrary, the attack on Sonnino was not pressed home and the Secret Sittings came to an end apparently without any vote being taken.     Vihen it came to voting Confidence in the Government at the conclusion of the public session, Oiolitti and his followers gave their votes for the Government which obtained a solid majority (345 to 50)- the minority consisting of the official Socialists with a few stalwarts from other groups.     Lr :^ The net result of the Session has been a distinct clearing of the political atmosphere.     Giolittism has been, if not forced into the onen, revealed as in practical alii, nee with anti-National Soci^&amp;ism, the ,w,.r-p vrty h;. s been strengthened and - roused to fresh vigour .,nd activity, while the deeL r. tldns of the ^resident of
Couneil make it fairly clear that he has definitely cut himself free from Oiolitti end his Caillaulist leanings, and mer-ns to pursue a vigorous policy of sincere co-operation with the Allies.     This was made evident in the public sittings of Dec. 15th and 22nd during which party and personal animosities once or twice produced scenes of tumultuous uproar.    One such scene occurred when, at the close of a very long and detailed denunciation of Government inertia in regard to the German and pro-German influences in Italy, in the course of which many names were mentioned, Signor Piirolini, one of the organisers of the League of National Defence, alluded to V. . Caillaux as the &apos;French Giolitti&apos;.     The sitting had to be suspended for 10 minutes. When it could be resumed, Oiolitti rose and, accepting the explona-tions meanwhile offered by Pirolini, declared that there was no parallel between the two cases.    He had never advocated and never would advocate a separate peace nor any act inconsistent with loyalty to the Allies.Signor Pirolini1s courageous indictment gave public expression to many facts which have long been discussed and deplored in private. It is valuable for that reason, but its effect is unfortunately weakened by a laok of discrimination.     Some of his charges can hard-ly be sustained by evidence and protests and denials are already flowing in.     The offioial organ of the Vatican, for instance, has published p note denying that any conversations took place between M. and Madame Caillaux and members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.General Dallolio said that in spite of all difficulties the recent losses of guns were in a fair way to be made up, and described the wonderful recovery of the army.Signor Crespi, the Food Commissioner, in expounding the situation as regards grain, complained of the rose-coloured account given by a certain Italian journal of the Italian grain-crop of 1917, wferefe
I .   i&apos;l I I Iwhich had generated suspicion in the minds of the Allies and corn-promised the success of the negotiations, so that instead of the required 39 million quintals only 30 million had been obtained. Italyxb position in regard to grain-supply, he said, was assured up to the end of January and, if the Allies kept their promises , she could hold out until next harvest.A oropos of this statement it may be pointed out in parenthesis that in Italy there is no regular orovision of separation allowancesto soldier&apos;s families   and that jaf despite the increase in rationsfreerecently decreed and the smell/policies granted to combatants, there is great discontent among the rank and file.    This discontent was in great part the cause of the aebacle in October, and is now aeoen-tuated by contrast with the lot of the French and English soldiers, Without very substantial assistance from the Allies this state of things cannot be adequately remedied - to say nothing of the In-evitable effects of a severe winter in a country where coal is absolutely unobtainabl eCvTeJen by the average middle-class citizen.Signor Nitti (Minister of the Treasury) in the course of his financial statement put the situation of Italy concisely and forcibly, &quot;We&quot;, he said, &quot;are dependent upon two nations - Great Britain and the United States - for all the necessaries of life.     We must by the- loyalty oi our behaviour and by discipline and self-sacrifice earn both for the war anil after the wer the most complete confidence of our Allies&quot;.     The people who up longer dared to prsise Germany slandered Great Britain, particularly on account of the high rate of exchange and the high price oi coal - neither of which are the fault of Great Britain.     What Italy needed above $11 was graig, coal and ships - and her difficulties would not end with the war.     But the Increased Savings Banks deposits and the creation of several new industries during the ..*dr were hopeful signs for the future.
On the last day of the Secret Session speeches were heard from the members of the new League;   from the Socialist Leader, Turati, who laid the blame for Caporetto on Cadorna and accused Sonnino of bfemng responsible for the misfortunes of Italy;   and from the veteran Republican CaJLajanni, who reproved Giolitti for deserting his post itt the hour of danger.   Finally the President of the Council rose and delivered o speech which is described as the strongest delivered by any Minister since the beginning of the war.     He assured the Chamber that the disrster on the Iscnzo front was forming the subject of an exhaustive investigation.     In reference to Signor Pirolini&apos;s speech he deprecated the introduction of personalities and regretted the attacks made by the speaker on Swiss residents in Italy end on high ecclesiastical personages.     The Italian clergy as a whole had shown a conspicuous example of patriotism.     Turning to the Socialists he observed that there was division in thfeir ranks;   he doubted whether the majority of the party followed their Deputies.    A certain number of these must be regarded not as members of a political party but rather of e criminal association, if it were true, as was asserted, that some of their leaders boasted that the Socialist party was the cause of the disasters of Caporetto.     He described the German propaganda work in Italy as a mortal danger to national unity, greater even than the danger at the front.     The Government fully recognised the duty of eliminating the danger without hesita-tion or respect of persons.Speaking of foreign affairs, Signor Orlando said there was no personal policy of Baron Sonnino.     His policy was that of the United Cabinet.     It had been consistent from the first and involved no concealments.    To tell the soldiers, as Signor Turati had hinted, that peace could be obtained but that Sonnino and the Government would not have it was to invite them to treachery.     The peace which
Socialists seemed to desire was only possible in the improbable event of a simultaneous outbreak of revolution in all belligerent countries.    The Socialist peace was a German invention like poison-gas and submarine warfare.     Another form of German peace had been referred to as a return to the status quo.     But there had been no concrete German proposal for the restitution of Belgium, nor had Austria indicated her intention of restoring the invaded provinces of Italy.     Before accepting such a peace Italy wouia retire fight-ing even, if it were necessary, as far as Sicily.    The only solu-tion for the difficulties and dangers of the situation was resis-tance, resistance and again resistance.1*
