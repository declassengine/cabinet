Oelenelbis wnm^j^jm phop^ty of his bih^iicjjaJSSTYrS GOYERHMSKT,  T.jr.T.- 3255 m&apos;AR CABIHZ!?.EXCEoS PROFITS DUTY.Hot3 by Mr, Bonar Lew,(Circulated with reference to Cabinet 315, Minute 2),ar220In accordance -sith my promise at the T!Tar Cabinet of the 5th instant, I circulate herewith a Memorandum by Dr, Stamp, Assist?nt Secretary to the Board of Inland Revenue, on the subject of the suggested increase of the rate from 80*6 to 100$.(Signed)   A. Bonar La?;.7th January, 1918.(1)   The chief issues involved in a change of this character have already been the subject of discussion, and the view taken by the Board hitherto has been that the proposal is impracticable unless the Excess Profits Duty is so completely altered in character as to be a totally different tax.     This view is daily snd amply confirmed by the experience of administering the present increased rate of 80% which, as v&amp;s foretold, is probably already &quot;beyond the point at which the maximum productivity of the duty would be found.     It is our emphatic opinion that the scheme of taxation that would have to be substituted if a &quot;rate&quot; of 1Q0% were imposed would as a producer of revenue be slow and comparatively ineffective for the urgency of war require-, ments, would give rise to endless complications in its ad-ministration, and have far greater inequalities in its incidence than the existing duty.     The chief reasons for this view are set out below,fi,ti on (2)    If the total reward that can be received or retainedM.Y.e.. to     by a producer or manufacturer is fixed (whether by reference ^ii to a pre-war standard of profits or &quot;otherwise) the Inevitableresult will be that as scon as that figure for a given period is reached, and he knows that whatever he does he can get not a fraction of further recompense, his produetion or manufactur will practically cease for that year or period.     This is not theory - it is a fact proved by the experience of the inceptiorTof the Munitions Levy.     The producer will cease to wear out his machines and to exhaust his energies, the colliery owner will conserve his capital coal resources, the shipowner would endeavour to lay up his vessel - every class will h-ive lostpAicentive, except a small proportion of individuals who from pure patriotism may go on working and wearing out capital for nothing.
With the present high prices,  the actual pre-war standard amount of profits is often now reached with a comparatively limited production.    If that limited produc-tion tended to be the whole   production, prices would rise still higher.In the Excess Profits Duty,  the trader retains the pre-war standard and 20% of the excess - if he works harder and produces more freely, the amount he retains is greater,-not it is true by a large sum, but still by a   sufficient amount in a good number of cases for him to feel it &quot;worth his while&quot; to go onAIt is found, with the rate at 80% only, that many manufacturers who have been working at high pressure, are reluctant to respond to Government demands for still further production, because &quot;it is not worth it&quot;.   But in the case of persons who are being urged to take up new ventures the effect of taxation is very marked and we are apprcached by manufacturers and Government Departments, with all kinds of expedients for giving &quot;tax-free&quot; incentive which really amount to circumvention of the tax.(3) It may be suggested that these difficulties oould be got over by increasing the standard profit which may be.retained.   But this merely shifts the point at which the trouble begins - it cannot even shift it far without producing a tax actually li.ght.er than the existing Excess Profits Duty,    It is condemned by the history of the Munitions Levy, which started off with a standard of six-fifths of the pre-war profits, and immediately met this &quot;lack of incentive&quot; obstacle.The second methbd of giving incentive is the provision of fluctuating allowances, such as allowances for services and output.   These methods were adopted for the Munitions Levy, and however narrowly they might be limited in amount they made that Levy in nearly all cases- a lighter impost than the Excess Profits Duty at 80%:    even if the Levy could be as promptly assessed and collected.   But if with ;. on$   class of industry those methods brought every kind of difficulty that ought to be absent from a scheme of taxation, much more over the whole range and diversity of industry (subject moreover to no such central control as the Ministry of kunitions exercises) would they bring the -&amp;xeess Profits Duty to deadlock a^:d hopeless congestion. Ho rule of %hmb method cor.ld fit the immense variety of oircumstance without gross inequity; and an attempt by a Central Department to make a genuine estimate /of

9 9 9- 3 -of tho worth of personal factors in each, case must break down through sheer weight and lack of detailed investigation,, oven granted that the Department could judge between tho claims of different industries.   Squally if such a task were delegated to local bodies, total lack of uniformity must result, and tho taxation of the Individual, being no longer upon settled rules, would have paskec. out of the hands of the House of Commons and the recognised Executive,iggteful-      (4) Where 80$ of tho Excessaprofit is taken In Excess Profits Dityi and a further &amp;ji in Income Tax, the trader may pay cut  100 for wages or advertising.or any other cause, and he suffers ih his own purse to the extent of  15 only. He can, and does, spend lavishly and wastefully, either to get uuite cheaply a reputation for generosity, or to build up a goodwill, or from sheer carelessness.   Y/ith a duty oflOQ/c, the very last hold upon economy is gone - he will squander money in expenses that may benefit him enly in the remotest contingency, if the whole of that expense comes out of the tax that he would otherwise pay.     The only remedy would be a complete control of the expenditure of every business - suoh a control may bo possible with seleoted classes of business such as munitions or shipping, but there is no possibility of establishing   a firm and effective supervision of all businesses.(5) With the rising prices of commodities, businesses find it difficult to hold their pre-war amount of stock unless some of the additional funds arising through increased profits are available.     If they cannot add to their pro-war capital from some source, they must inevitably hold smaller stocks - especially where tho stook Is naturally held for some time&apos; (e,g, tanning).   It must not be forgotten that the real value of the pro-war profit standard is a constantly diminishing amount,    If the duty is raised to 100 per cent this trouble must become very much more acute.     The provision of renewals or extensions of plant et higher prices is open to a similar difficulty.political     (6) The lOOf tax inevitably involves a scheme which aspects    will resemble the Munitions Levy.   That scheme quite bolied its appearance of being a heavier tax than tho Excess Profits Duty at 80 per cent, to say nothing of the fact that by delay in assessment and payment it ceased to be an effective tax at all9     Even where ft was heavier, and even where it was effective, it was only so&quot;&quot;because it had the alternative liability to Excess Profits Duty just under it and behind it, compelling settlement and payment.To secure legislation for even the 80), rate of duty, r-11 sorts of baits and devices were necessary, viz:- highrates of interest, reliefs for ancient losses and small businesses, while the efforts mado to annul the effect of too increase in rate by s )ecisl concessions in valuing stocks,  though violent then, and now renewed,   &apos;OUld With rate of loO per cent create a parliamentary situation Of extraordinary difficult;;,(Moreover it may be mentioned that the proposal would practically destroy the financial scheme of Coal Control, which recently passed the House of Commons - the Controller^ source of income would stop completely, and it would be immediately necessary for the Government to re^oem their pledge and to introduce a Bill throwing the whole of the guarantee provisions upon the Exchequer).Laok of Funds
