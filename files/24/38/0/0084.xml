I circulate, for the information of the -far Cabinet, a COP3J of a memorandum prepared in the Board of Trade for the consideration of General Sraits*s :mr Priority Committee on the question of supplies of Linseed Oil for industrial use. I understand that the Committee have como to theconclusion that, in view of the pressing claims of food supplies and munitions of war, the use of linseed oil should he strictly confined to these purposes.If this decision is upheld &quot;by the ;;var Cabinet, the result will be,to close down the Linoleum and Oilcloth manufactur-ing trades, located mainly in the towns of Lancaster and Kirkcaldy, which are very largely dependent upon this partic- &apos; ular industry, I have received pressing&quot; representations as to the seriousness of the position, as several thousands of people will he thrown out of work, the majority of whom, owing to age or other&apos;disability, are unfit for other employment, even if it could be found locally.     It will therefore he essential to decide, as in the somewhat similar case of the Cotton Trade, what steps can be taken to deal with the dangerous situation created by the unemployment resulting from the closing down of the industry.      The matter is urgent, and I hope that it&apos; may be possible for it to. be discussed by the War Cabinet without delay.Board of Trade,9th January, 1918. if
Memorandum by the  resident of the Board of Trade.- UIWD OIL K)R UN0L3UM MMIUFAOTURE.The Linoleum and -Oil Cloth IndustryThe position of the linoleum and oil cloth industry has become extremely critical, chiefly through a shortage of linseed oil, but also (though, to a less extent) through a. shortage of other materials, especially ccrk and also pigments.   The facts are as follows:-1.   The industry is one of the more Important minor trades&quot; of the United Kingdom, our exports of Linoleum and Oilcloth having amounted in &quot;value to  2,6 million1 in 1913, to  2.2. million in 1914 and to  1.6 million in 1915.   During the war the, industry has supplied a. goou deal of oilcloth, etc. (including leather cloths and oil baizes) for warships, hospitals and other national purposes.   It is understood, however, that only about 25% of the output of the principal firms represents Government orders and that these orders are usually for plain cloth and keep,  only an inconsiderable part of the machinery running.   It would be uneconomic for the works to run on Government Orders only. 2. Linoleum manufacture is the principal industry of Kirkcaldy and Lancaster and is also carried on to a consid-erable extent at other places, more particularly in and around London especially at Staines, Lancaster and Kirkcaldy have each a population of about 40,000 and are very largely dependent on this industry.3. The number actually employed at the outbreak of war wasabout 11,000 and in October 1917 at least 8,000.   Thenumber of men employed in the industry has of course declinedbut the number of women employed.has increased.   It isstated that of the men still employed at Kirkcaldy, themajority are between 60 and 70 years of age..4. Linseed oil is essential for the manufacture ofLinoleum and oil cloth, and, despite all endeavon^no^^^
substitute for it has been found. ; The Director of Oils wroto on. December 20th to Sir lorval Helms M,r\ advising the trade to make every effort to discover a substitute, hut the Board of Trade inquiries show that this is altogether impracticable.    The normal annual consumption .of linseed oil in the country recently has been about 100,000 tons and during the tfar the consumption for linoleum and oil cloth has been about 24,000 tons a year. 5.   There has now developed a serious shortage of oleaginous produce which is under the control of the Oils and Fats Depart-aient of the Ministry of Food.    That department have accordingly found it necessary to limit the use of vegetable oils to the two most essential noods viz., the production of (a) Margarine and (b) glycerine.    They have informed the trade that no further supplies of linseed oil will bo allowed, and have now issued an order controlling, and enabling them to requisition, all linseed oil.    Manufacturers of Linoleum &amp;c. may not commence to treat any oil for uso in tho manufacture of linoleum and oil cloth without consent of the Ministry of Food in each case.   The Ministry has offered to allow sufficient for Government Orders, but the Trade assert that these are insufficient to enable the trado to carry oru6.   Oils suitable for food purposes are being used for margarine and those unsuitable for these purposes for glycerine.   The latter class inclides linseed oil.   It is understood that 350,000 tons of oils, and fats are required for the manufacture of margarine and a further 350,000 tons for the manufacture of glycorine, 700,000   i tons in all; but there will actually be available, only 516,000 ton-of oil on the assumption that none of this cargo is, lost at sea. V.   As regards linseed oil the position is as follows;-(i) On 30th September stocks still amounted to 52,000 tons(ii) The Ministry of Food had,arranged to import during the succeeding. 12 months 314,000 tons of linseed which would have yielded about 103,000 tons of oil.(iii) The 314,000 tons of seed, however, included 200,000 tons(2), 1
which were $o..hm&amp; bdea J)rotigJUt  torn the Argentine.however, as this import has been disallowed hy the Treasury, we shall he able to import only about 114.000 tons of seed, equivalent to about 38.,009 tons of oil. (iv)   It follows that there will not be sufficient linseedGlycerine can be made from other oils than Linseed, whereas linoleum and oilcloth cannot-.    If the policy of the Ministry of Pood is persisted in, it will mean the complete closing down of the Linoleum industry.    Such a result would be most unfortunate, whether from the standpoint of the capital invested in the industry, its value to our oversea trade, or the hardships inflicted on a number of work-people and their dependents who could not readily be transferred to more essential industries,  American competition has developed during the war in the British Dominions,   The question for consideration therefore is whether and how far it may be possible to prevent, or at least to mitigate, the contingency described.Such information as it has been possible to obtain suggests J that stocks of linseed oil in the hands of linoleum makers may amount to about 6,000 tons (Tho treatment of the oil for&quot;this particular industry takes about 3 months).. Representatives of the industry have suggested that they should be allowed a reduced ration of 16,000 tons a year, including the stocks just mentioned..    This means an import of 10,000 tons .of. Oil (or 30,000 tons of seed)..-The main question for decision is therefore whether inclui-ing existing stocks, the industry should be allowed a ration of 16,000 tons of linseed oil (this is little over 2% of the amount of oil required for margarine and glycerine).   Inasmuch as some 4,000 tons are consumed for Government work, the allo-v. ance for ordinary trade.would thus be only 12,000 tons.   If it is decided that such an allowance cannot be made, then the industry will have to close down and a relief scheme for the districts affectad iray ho^oiao-neoer^ary.oil for the production of glycerine alone.
Board of-Trace-   The   question   m      accordingly submitted for the con-sideration of the War Priorities Committee as a matter of urgency.11.    There are a number of important, but subsidiary, questions which can be settled after a decision has been given on the Linseed Oil Question.    If it is. decided that the maintenance of the Linoleum industry is sufficiently desirable to justify the allocation to it of the specified quantity of. Linseed oil, fur-ther steps in certain other directions (e.g.. the importation of certain consignments of cork which are awaiting shipment at Spanish and Algerian ports) could also be taken up.    If not, then the other questions fall.12.    In the event of it being decided to maintain the linoleum industry it - ould be for the Board, of Trade to arrange with the industry for securing the greatest possible economy of produc-tion whether by centralising output or otherwise , and for distributing the,oil on some equitable basis among the various users.    The trade has already an organisation for such dis-tribution in respect of Zinc and Lead compounds. 13.    The Questions for decision are therefore:-(1) Should the Linoleum industry be maintained by allowingit a sufficient ration of linseed oil (at least 16,000tons)?(ii) If so, should (a) additionalshipping space be pro-vided for 10,000 tons of oil (if obtainable from India) or 30,000 tons of linseed for this purpose as the case may be;   and (b) manufacturers of linoleum, etc. be left free to deal with stocks of linseed oil at present in their hands or held on their account? (iii) If additional shipments are impossible should any con-tingent of linseed oil beyond the stocks mentioned in ii (b) be allowed to linoleum etc. manufacturers?(SG-D) A. H, 8TANL3I.
