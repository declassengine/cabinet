^ This Document is the Props-ty of Colonel Jones His Britannic Majecty&apos;s Government \S E. C R E. T.       16*OPERATIONS.Prom:- General Barter, Petrograd. To;-     C.I.G.S., War Office.Despatched 10.15, p.m. 1st January1918.Received      6.15   p.m. 2nd January1918.So. I..P,Military Missions left Kieff night of December 19th and last night after delay caused by trains (sic), and removal by soldiers for their orm purposes arrived Petrograd.   Everywhere there is great di3-organization of railway system and numerous accidents, all stations are crowded by undisciplined soldiers leaving front.At Kieff political situation unchanged: agents are very active.     Ukrainian Government is disappointed that Allies have not recognised their independence and promised material support. I had veiled threats conveyed to me that if the Allies would not help them they would have to turn to Central Powers.     It was reported Turkish and Bulgarian delegates shortly expected in KielDuring past fortnight I have made investigations in Kieff and have formed conclusion that either in a military,economic J or popular sense the Ukraine Government has little stability; it cannot find money and would.lose popularity with the peasant class if it interfered with excesses of(against (?)) landowners. Government is certainly not supported by majority of the educa-ted class and, although in appearance disciplined, the troops cannot be counted upon to resist any strong attack.    A few days ago the so-called Ukraine Guard Regiment joined the Bolsheviks at Erinoslav.Commander of Kieff troops was pessimistic regarding willing-ness of Ukraine troops to fight again.   Bolshivik troops are fortunately equally unwilling.     Unlike Poland there is very little national sentiment among troops or population. Bolshiviks now hold all railway junctions in East Ukraine, therefore communication is practically severed between Kieff and Don,The feeling between Poles and Ukralns is at present not friendly owing to question of partition of Galicia.     To the Roumanian Military representative who had unofficially conveyed to me the views of the Ukraine Government and who- is temporarily remaining at Kieff I pointed out her; difficult was the position of the Allies at present moment with regard to recognition of Ukraine independence; and that question oould not be definitely decided nop? but only at general peace, and that in patience and loyalty to Allies lay Ukraine1 a best hope.I knot: my remarks will be repeated in the right quarters.This morning Ambassador informs me that there are reported to be hitches in peace negotiations and that Bolsheviks have discovered German plot- to restore monarchy.     This is not official however.     Have left Colonel Edwards at Stavka but he&apos; cannot be of much use as Krxlerko has stopped all coded messages there.
