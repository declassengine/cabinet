His BrltaiiniG r-r-h .\.v&apos;s f -v-mrpent.) &quot;SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE IIFQRHATIOH. 28 oh Dec. - 3rd Jan. 1918.1. DSKMARK.      The Danish shipowners profess to he considerably dis-satisfied with the results of the Anglo-2)anish Shipping Agreement.   They complain that the losses to Danish shipping chartered to the Allies have been unduly hi^i, representing at least 40$ per annum of the ships employed.   They point out that the embargoes imposed by Great Britain and the United States upon imports into Denmark have set free a dis-proportionate amount of Danish shipping for Allied services in the danger zone.   Only 150,000 tons have been retained in Danish trades and of this tonnage 25,000 tons have already been lost.     They accordingly feel justified in refusing the request which we recently addressed to them that they should make good the deficit due to losses in the 200,000 tons of Danish shipping placed in the Anglo-French coal trade.   The deficit in question now amounts to some 25,000 tons.82. SWEDE!.        We are asking the Swedes to prohibit altogether the export to Germany of the first and second quality grades of iron ore and of all slag, and to reserve for export to the Allies all the products of these ores which cannot be utilised in Sweden.      We also ask that the Allies may have the option of purchasing half the output of the lower grade ores on the understanding that the output will be kept within specified limits.      Mr. Wallenberg is referring these proposals to the Swedish Government without comment.    He has however made the counterproposal that Sweden should reduce her annual exports to Germany of iron ore to 1,000,000 tons and should correspond-ingly increase her exports to the Allies.The Swedish delegates ask that pending the conclusion of a general agreement with the Allies Sweden should be
11 3allowed under a preliminary modus Vivendi to import limited quantities of fodder, fertilisers, illuminants, coffee, cocoa, dried fruits, hides, leather and cork plates for refrigerators. We are prepared to consider these proposals as soon as a satis-factory basis of agreement has been reached in regard to fa) iron ore,   (b) shipping and   (c) a Swedish loan.We have agreed to sell to Sweden 200,000 barrels of the 1917 catch of Norwegian fish held by the British Purchasing Agency.     The Swedes undertake in return:-(1) To prohibit the export from Sweden of fish and fish products including seals and seal products for twelve months.(2) To land in Swedish ports all fish caught by Swedish fishermen except where the fish is transferred at sea to vessels approved by H.Mo legation at Stockholm.(3) To allow free transit facilities, if desired, for the despatch of fish to Finland and Russia.(4) To allow no exports from Sweden of staves or boxboards except   (1) to Allied countries or (2) to Denmark, Spain and non-European neutrals withii the limits of the 1913 figures.ILANDS. The Dutch delegates in London have provisionallyaccepted the heads of a general agreement with the Allies and have gone home to discuss them with the Dutch Government.   The terms proposed are as follows:-(1)   Holland to receive agreed quantities of supplies for home consumption.(2)   Dutch ships to be allowed bunkers in Allied &amp; United States ports and to be cleared without delay.(3)   Holland to receive 100,000 tons of coal monthly from the United Kingdom;   the Dutch in return to put at the disposal of the Allies all the Dutch tonnage not needed for supplying Holland or for Dutch inter-colonial trade.The existing Anglo-Dutch Agricultural Agreement to stand with the necessary modifications and to be recog-nised by the Dutch Government.
3.The rations proposed under the above scheme include 400,000 tons of cereals annually, and 35,000 tons of oils and fats.      The rations for mineral oils are reduced from 224,000 tons to 140,000 tons;   for cotton and ootton goods from 78,000tons to 26,000 tons;   for wool and woollen goods from 12,000 tons to 6,000 tons.Neither the Dutch nor the Allied Governments are yet committed to these proposals ana it is far from certain whether(5) Arrangements to &quot;be   made, with the assent of the Dutch Government, for financing Allied purchases in Holland,(6) The import into Holland of textiles and raw materials for textiles to he conditional upon the Allies obtain-ing the whole cf the Dutch flax crop and two thirds of the Dutch flax seed,(7) Ho materials imported under the agreement to he used in repairing or &quot;building ships for enemy services either during or after the war,(8) lot more than 2,000 tons of fish and fish products to be exported to the enemy or mote than 2,000 tons to the Belgian Belief Commission;   no fishoil or fish livers to be exported to the enemy;   Dutch trawlers to be allowed to fish from British ports.(9) The Allies to allow facilities for the import into Holland during 1918 of fertilisers up to 70$ of the 1916 imports from overseas;   the Dutch in return to prohibit the export to the enemy of potatoes, potato flour and sugar (with certain unimportant reservations) and to guarantee sufficient sugar for the manufacture of condensed milk etc for export to the United Kingdom under the Agricultural Agreement.(10)The Allies to facilitate the import into Holland during 1918 of 250,000 tons of fodder;   the Dutch in return not to export to the enemy more than 8,200 tons of butter and 15,000 tons of cheese and to prohibit the export to the enemy altogether of cattle, meat, pork, pig products, poultry, game, rabbits and eggs;   no exports of horses to be allowed beyond the 5,000 head which the Dutch have already engaged to supply to Ger-many and these horses to be not less than eight years old.(11)The full requirements of the Allies in quinine bark and sulphate to be met.(12)Increased supplies to be furnished to the Allies of tin and castor oil.(1.3)The free imports into Holland of coffee and tobacco to cease on April 1st and to fce limited to the balance of the 1916 crops still to be shipped.
the Dutch will accept the conditions we attach to the import of fodder.    They may prefer to dispense with imports of  odder altogether.     The United States representatives in London have concurred in the above scheme.4* SWITZERLAND.      The American Swiss Agreement signed at Paris onDec. 5th pledges the United States Government to supply Switzerland with 240,000 tons of bread cereals by September 1918, and to furnish the necessary tonnage.     This pledge is not in accordance with the resolution passed by the Allied representatives at the recent inter-Allied Conference in Paris and war? never formally approved by them.     The British representative was not present at the meeting when the matter was discussed and did not even know that themeeting was to be held.     The United States Government regard themselves as definitely bound by their pledge, which already has had an unfortunate effect upon the progress of our negotiations with the Swiss for a British loan.     We doubt whether the undertaking can In practice be fulfilled.   We are informing the United States Government that we cannot accept any responsibility for the discharge of this obligation, though we will do what we can, through the Inter-Allied Exe-cutive, to meet the general tonnage requirements of Switzerland.United States Cable Censor at Pernambuco that the United StatesGovernment will endeavour by means of their censorship(1)   To prevent neutrals from obtaining supplies from South America to replace shipments stopped by the United States embargo;(2)   To suppress speculative purchases by neutrals in South America as likely to be for enemy account or as liable to raise prises or withdraw goods from the market to the detriment of the Allies.. UNITED STATES.It appears from instructions issued to the
5.The Censor at Pernambuoo is instructed, to take special note of neutral cables relating to food, fodder, wool and hides in South America.The United States Government have decided to allow no further exports to Russia of goods of military value.   On the other hand they have released 40,000 tons of oats and maize for immediate export to Finland on grounds of common humanity. It is as yet uncertain whether any really satisfactory control can he organised over foodstuffs arriving in Finland.SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN.
