(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-01? ELS-BRPMIG &quot;MAJESTY&quot;^GOVERNMENT..)SECRETGiT, 3252,WAR GSiEtiEB?THE AIR MINISTRY AND !TH3 3RIT2SH MUSEUM.Memorandum by I.y:.cl Curson0I plead with the Cabinet to reverse the decision, arrivedat in the absence of some of its Members, to clear the BritishMuseum of the greater portion of its collections, in order tohouse the Air Ministry.   This decision has evoked a unanimousand indignant protest from the entire press, the Universities, *the learned Societies, and the cultured thought of the Nation.None of our Allies, though more sorely pressed than purselves^have resorted to any such procedure.   The French have.not installeda Department of any sort, still less a fighting Department,., inthe galleries of the Louvre.   The Italians have spared the Palaceof the Doges at Venice,   It is to be reserved, to us to set theexample of deliberately exposing our most precious possessionsto the bombs of the enemy?.But it may be said that they   will not be so exposedbecause the galleries will be cleared.   This is not the case...In the first place the -reading room and the libraries are stillto be kept open to the public, so that fire in the building;whether accidental or resulting from ait attack would still befatal to some of our greatest national treasures.    Secondly*have we realised what the packing of the. sculptures, the china,the glass.,, the countless delicate and perishable objects mustin point mean^both of risk and of time.As regards to the former, many juch objects will beirretrievably damaged, or tho more that tnere is no staffof trained   packers available to carry out the removal.
As regards time, the proposal was urged on the ground that the British Museum is the only building in which.the Air Ministry can be rapidly installed,     I have ascertained that it will be   months before the tube will be ready that is - te receive the removed collections, and the same period before the tele*-phones required by the Air Ministry can be laid.    It will be 3 weeks before the packing cases begin to be received;   and many months before the collection can be pacxeu sfld removedtIn the meantime the building will be in a state of complete disorganisation, a limited portion sii.ll dedicated to culture a d pertinent partially and uncomfortably installed in the remainder, and noise and confusions prevailing every-whereoFurther even when the building has been cleared it is now found that it will not accommodate the whole of the Air Ministry (the main justification that was offered for the  proposal);   while we were not told the other day that the Office of Works has twice examined and reported against the building as most unsuitable for office purposes.     I believe that this view is entertained by some members of the Air Council itself.Finally, even if this great end     costly disturbance were to be tolerated for the duration of the- War, has anyone foreseen the long period that must elapse - it might amount to years before the contents could be restored and the Museum re-opened to the public?I find it difficult to believe that merely because the Air Ministry has no-   been created, it should be found impossible to house it in any other place.   The Papers have
7th Januaryj 19la.been full of suggestions, tne Savoy Hotel&apos;(to be connected with the Hotel Cecil) Whitehall Jourt, so mo other Club or Clubs.     I offer no opinion *:s to these.    But -if there -vere no British museum or if the Government h3d given s pledge in Parliament tn-?t it should not be touched, n   ?solution -voulci be found and can, I venture to think, ..&apos;iti good will, be found now.I ask my colleagues not to persist in a decision which ir s caused universal consternation, which is not defensible even on the -rounds of expediency, and qhich will expose not merely the structure of the Museum, with its conspicuous roof, to legitimate attacks by the onemy,&quot; but many of the treasures which are stored therein, to serious, and very likely irreparable damage..The same arguments apply in a scarcely minor degree to-the proposal to appropriate the iiatural History Museum at Kensington.(Initialled)     G. of K,
