137/SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BAT//024.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary.   XXIV. (5th January, 1918.)One of the most remarkable features during the late autumn and early winter in Austria-Hungary was the extremely outspofcen discussion of economic conditions throughout the press.    The censorship had obviously set free discussion on problems of food, supplies and transport.    And there are a good many reasons for thinking that this was genuinely due to the acute pressure of public opinion, under the stress of widespread misery.    The victories in Italy did not change this: indeed criticism of the economic situation still continues to receive the same prominence as before.    But since the Bolshevik coup dfetat, and above all since the peace negotiations at Brest, there has been a great change, and it is abundantly clear that the censor has relegated economic troubles to the background - partly with a view to impressing foreign opinion and tempting it to assume an improvement in Austria-Lungary&apos;s situation, partly in order to play upon home public opinion by a policy of &quot;suggestion&quot; and thus to render it more malleable and patient in adversity by holding out the prospect of an early arrangement with Russia.Needless to say, the Bolshevik regime and the characters of Lenin and Trotski are discussed from every possible angle and with a wealth of detail which is partly due to the fact that Lenin was in Austria during the earlier part of&quot; the war and therefore has many friends there.     It is also to be noted that through his wife he is connected with the Adler family (Dr. Viktor Adler is the leader of the German Majority Social Democrats in
- 2 -Austria, and his son Dr. Priedrich Adler, the assassin of the late premier, Count Sttfrgkh, is the &quot;martyr&quot; of the Minority Socialists). There is even a good deal of Bolshevism to be noticed in various sections of the press - notably in the official Socialist organ ffepszava; and even in the respectable Radical and pacifist newB-papers of Budapest (IT.B.   It has to be admitted that these latter are almost the only Magyar papers which are entitled to the adjective &quot;respectable&quot;: for in Budapest there is a greater over-production of newspapers than in any other capital in the world, with the result that most newspapers live from hand to mouth and are dependent on cryptic and changing political support, which often takea the form of being financed by big banking concerns, very often foreign banking concerns).     The Nepszava in particular has attacked with greater violence than ever the ruling class in Hungary, not only for its attempt to falsify electoral reform, but also for its annexationist designs.     It has recently devoted more than one leader to what it describes as the &quot;pan-Germans of Hungary&quot;, who Wish to retain Lov^en, to send troops to Flanders, to prevent inter-State arbitration and maintain armaments, to keep Serbia from the sea and to include Poland in the Monarchy.     It claims also - and its claim carries conviction - that there have been very widespread protests against the ideas put forward by the Magyar jingoes.     Count Andrassy appears to have taken alarm at the hostility with which his utterances were received, and has written several articles in his own press complaining of the attitude adopted towards him as anything but a peace attitude.     The Nepszava, in true Bolshevik phrases, retorts that &quot;we never claimed to be supporters of a peace spirit in internal politice.but have always proclaimed open class war&quot;.The Hungarian Government is evidently alarmed at the grov/th of criticism in the press, and (probably in collusion with Tisza and hie party) has started a regular offensive against not merely
ffepszava, but also Az Est (the Daily Mail of Hungary, with mcuh the widest circulation), and three other &quot;advanced&quot; journals, which have been noted for their opposition to Tisza and hi9 reactionaries.It is worth adding that, obviously by order, a very discreet veil has been drawn over such an incident as the murder of General Duhonin.     Even the official and semi-official press have obviously received orders to treat Benin, Trotski and the others with great respect and to avoid the comment&apos;which might ordinarily be expected from such organs.     It is obvious that only on such a basis could Count Czemin throw Austrian diplomatic traditions to the winds by meeting the Russian revolutionaries at Brest.Count Czerninfs pronouncements on foreign policy in the Hungarian Delegation were analysed in some detail in the last report.    Here he was certain of a friendly reception and indeed met with practical unanimity.    The composition of the Austrian Delegation ensured him a majority, but also made it impossible to prevent the Slav point of view finding open expression.     It was therefore necessary to evade its sittings if possible.     This would appear to be the explanation of Count Czernin1s sudden illness last month, from which he did not recover until it was necessary to leave post haste for the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk with the natural result that the Austrian Delegation had to be postponed till his return.All the available evidence goes to suggest that Count Czernin, since the transformation of the Italian and Russian situations, has become more reactionary in   his outlook and now stands closer to Berlin than at any previous period.     The fact that the late Bavarian Premier is now Chancellor has undoubtedly had a beneficial result upon the relations between Vienna and Berlin, Austrophil Munich acting as a useful intermediary.     Czernin.,would Beem to have been taken between two fires - Berlin on the one hand and
Budapest on the other - and to have to come to terms, in regard to foreign policy, with the foremost representatives of the old order in Hungary, Counts Tisza and Andrassy.     He is known to have conferred with them privately on several occasions at great length, and for the last month or more their mutual relations have been marked by an entirely new cordiality.     It is of course possible that he is using them for purposes of bargaining, just as Count Hertling may be using Tirpitz, Reventlow and the extreme annexation-ists for a similar purpose in another field.    But it is to be feared that he has in reality capitulated to their ideas (which were certainly not his a year ago), sees the Monarchy^ sole hope in closest alliance with Berlin and hopes by certain obvious devices to stretch the phrase &quot;no annexations&quot; so as to cover measures which would merely be annexation in a veiled form.In its broad lines his policy would seem to fall under two heads.     (a)   He accepts the phrase ^Self-Determination&quot; in order to entice the Russian doctrinaires into his peace-trap (possibly with the knowledge that he has his agents among them), but seeks to limit its application most strictly to States, not nations or nationalities.    This view, which has been put forward not only by him but by the Austrian and Hungarian Premiers, has been further developed by him during the Brest negotiations, in the sense that in constitutional countries self-determination can only be applied through the existing constitutional frame-work.     This is of course only a clumsy device for treating Austria-Hungary as a unit and faiimfoiriftg the various national units inside Austria-Hungary, which are either hopeless minorities or in some oases virtually un-represented in Parliament, from expressing themselves.These tactics appear to have been too much for the Russian Delegates and are freely denounced by Mr. Trot ski in his appeal to the Allied nations (suppressed by the British censorship but printed in the Daily Review of the 1st January).
(b)    He accepts the other Russian phrase of &quot;Ho annexations&quot;, but evidently seeks to interpret it in accordance with the theories now widely in favour in Germany, which allow an intermediate stage between independent sovereign states and dependent vassal states. Thus Belgium would retain her King and Parliament and even perhapa her army, but would have to consent to economic control in respect of railways, ports, canals and perhaps tariffs.    The same would apply mutatis mutandis to Poland.With regard ttf Serbia rival schemes are on foot, whioh vary according to the Austrian or Hungarian angle of their advocates. Count Czernin in his recent speech credited the Serbian Government with direct complicity in the Sarajevo Murders * a charge whioh goes much further even than the official attitude of Vienna in July 1914 and is so notoriously absurd as to require no refutation at this stage.     It is probable that the charge has been adapted officially in this form, in order to persuade public opinion that a change of dynasty in Serbia is an essential preliminary to any settlement.    It is being hinted in many quarters that Serbia might be allowed to retain her independent administration and even a king of her own, if only she abandoned her separate army and accepted a olose commercial arrangement (not, necessarily a customs union) with her northern neighbour.    Military and naval circles insist upon the need for occupying the Belgrade^Semendria district, so that Austria-Hungary should be athwart the great rivers in the event of future trouble.    But here again it is being hinted to the Serbs that if they consent to disarmament, they can be left in possession.    Finally voices are raised against allowing Serbia to unite with Montenegro or to obtain access to the sea: but here also it is made abundantly clear that all obstacles will fall, if Serbia oonsents to enter the military and economic sphere of the Dual Monarchy.
The main temptation, however, is the prospect held out in certain quarters that such a &quot;surrender   to the inevitable&quot; will be compensated by the attainment of Southern Slav national Unity, even though inside the Habsburg Monarchy.     It is obvious that the. Southern Slav leaders already inside, will accept some such arrangement at the peace, if they cannot obtain the larger pro-gramme of independence.    But thert is more abundant evidence than ever of the unanimous desire of the Southern Slavs to shake off Austrian and still more Magyar rule and ; ork out their own destinies.It has proved utterly impossible for the enemy Powers to find a single politician of even second or third-rate importance among their own Southern Slavs or among those Serbs of the Kingdom who remained behind, who was ready to advocate an &quot;Austrian1&apos; solution. Mr. Marghiloman, former leader of the Conservative Party in Roumania (who has the most intimate personal as well as party reasons for hostility to Mr. Bratianu), is publicly advocating an alliance between Roumania and Central Europe, no longer on a secret dynastic basis, but openly &quot;from nation to nation&quot;.    The ex-Premier, Mr. Carp, and Professor Stere age even advocating a &quot;constitutional connection&quot; with the Central Powers: while the Roumanian ex-liinister in Berlin, Mr. Beldiman, is organising meetings to denounce the Entente policy of &quot;fighting it out&quot; as spelling the extinction of the small nations, and to repudiate as hypocritical Sir Edward Carson^ pledges at the inaugural meeting of the Anglo-Roumanian Society.     All these men are thoroughly discredited in Roumania, but there is a very definite design of using them to weaken the resistance of their political rivals, the Roumanian Government at Jussy, and establish under them such a pseudo-Government as might prostitute the formula of &quot;Ho Annexations&quot; to the advantage of Austria-Hungary and hence of Germany.Bohemia.     The campaign of recrimination between Czechs and Magyars continues, and is seriously affecting the good relations
143   j- 7 - j-    - - &apos; -     ,- - - ^      : -- .&apos;.    ibetween Austria and Hungary.     Attacks of unexampled violence have been made in the Magyar press - even the ron-Jingo press - upon Austrian tolerance of ant i*-Magyar agitation, and have been acoom-paaied by open hints that a movement in Hungary for complete separation will be the result.    The Budapest Town Council, and several County Assemblies, have been the scene of bitter protests.Baron Madarassy-Beok, a prominent TiszaiBt deputy, has demanded in Parliament the withdrawal of Czech troops from Bohemia owing to their &quot;behaviour for which no words oan be found&quot;.    This draws publio attention to the fact that the great maes of Czech troops have for long past been too anti-Austrian to be employed on the frwit and have therefore been used to hold down Bohemia.    Naturally this method of employing the motto &quot;Divide et Impera&quot; is not con-ducive to improving the already strained relations of the two races.Ninety German deputies in the Austrian Parliament have brought forward in the form of an interpellation, a bulky volume recounting the &quot;treachery&quot; and anti-Austrian agitation of the Czechs during this war.     Other interpellations complain of the surrender of Czech officers on the Italian front, and of an Austrian torpedo-destroyer, whose Slav crew overpowered its-officers and steamed into Ancona.Meanwhile the Decree recognising the Bohemian Army as a distinct unit on the Entente side, has been published officially in Paris, signed by MM. Poincare1, Clemenoeau and Pichon.    The oath of allegiance is to be taken to the Czeoh National Committee, under Professor Masaryk, Major Stefanik and Dr. Benes: and it is hoped to enrol about 130,000 men, though this of course depends upon transit conditions from Russia.    This move has caused consternation and fury in Vienna.    The Neue ffreie^Presse devotee one of the most extraordinary leading articles to the subject, and denounces the Czech Army as - &quot;fops&quot;.1     The creation of this Army can be fairly regarded as a new fact in the European political situation -
m   8   -a fact which could not be undone oven by a peace unfavourable to the Allied cause.     The voluntary adhesion of so large a proportion of the manhood of the Czech nation to the cause of independence makes it quite impossible ever to take action against them when they return home, and it will always be necessary to reckon with them in the future and with the national sentiment which prompted their action.    This is all the more important because their action has the tacit approval of the nation at home and its leaders.The Austrian Slavs and Peace.    The attitude of the Slav Bloc in the Reiohsrat towards the Brest negotiations deserves special notice.      On 18 December the Czeoha, Jugoslavs and Ukrainians intro-duced an interpellation demanding the election of popular represent-atives (for all the various nationalities of the Monarchy), to take part in the peace discussions at Brest.    Their motion of urgency was carried by 140 to 132,and a debate followed in which the Czech leader,M* Stanek, denied the right of the German and Magyar states-men to speak in the name of the whole Monarchy, and reaffirmed the right of Self-Determination for the Czechs and the other national-ities.    Mr. Habermann, speaking in the name of the Ozeoh Social Democratic Party, reaffirmed the claim of a Czeoho-Slovak State, and declared in favour of &quot;negotiation from one nation to another&quot;.The Austrian Premier rejected the idea of popular represent-atives, as being &quot;contrary to the spirit of all constitutional States&quot;.     The German Agrarian spokesman opposed the bare idea of the nationalities being represented, and emphasised the rifrhts of the Crown to decide upon matters of peace and war: while the leader of the Christian Socialists in the House denounced those of its members2&quot;who are still speculating on the help of the Entente&quot;.    lo such confirmation was really needed to show the unanimity of Czech and Southern Slav feeling in favour of a non-German peace.
; 145.m   9   -Austrian Intrigue in Switzerland.   -While Count Ozernin celebrates hie irrevocable loyalty to the German Alliance, Switzerland ie once more full of Austrian agents, whose aim it is to inveigle the Entente into discussions and to extract information regarding JSntente intentions.    Among these are the ex-Ambassador Count Mensdorff, the Ballplatz official von Hontlong (who has for the past year been at the head of a bureau of Austrian espionage at Geneva) and Herr Meinl, the Viennese Jewish &quot;Coffee King&quot;, who according to information received has recently been sounding opinion in representative circles in Berlin.    Herr Meinl, who waB an active promoter of the ^Austrian political Society&quot; last summer, has last month, with Herr Frankfurter (a director of the Austrian Lloyd) acquired the ownership of the &quot;Radical Viennese newspaper Die Zeit -hitherto the only paper even relatively detached and independent in its criticism - and has ejected its two editors, with a view *0 a geflgwtnt of the paper1 s policy.    Their removal may perhaps be connected with the views professed by Herr Meinl in Switaerland, to the effeot that Ludendorff and his Staff are now desirous of peace and not disposed to advocate a purely annexationist policy.Another Austrian emissary, Stepanek, has been sent to get into touch with the Serbs in Switzerland, but having been unsuccessful seems to have found it wiser to come into the open in a letter to the Gazette de Lausanne.    He is a Slav, but of no importance whatever,    It is not impossible that his now exploded intrigue was connected with Prinee Mirko of Montenegro, who is still active in Vienna, though probably not taken too seriously by the Austrian authorities.Erratum.By an unfortunate slip the last sentence in Report XXIIIwas reproduced in a form which makes no sense.     It should run as follows: &quot;This is the fate reserved for Serbia and Roumania by Austria-Hungary, for Lithuania, Courland and Belgium by Germany, for Poland by one or the other.&quot;
