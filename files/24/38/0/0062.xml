I3JTELLIGEBCE BUREAU.. *WEEKLY    REPORT     ON    .GERMA3JY. 7th January, 1918.1. For the last week the interest in other topics hasbeen suspended, and Germany, like other nations, has been watching intently the deeply interesting game that has been playing at Brest Idtovsk*     Unfortunately we have little informa-tion from Germany except that available in the newspapers.   This is to be regretted, for never has it been so important to know exactly what was going on in responsible circles.2. In the German press the predominant note has beena streng expression of confidence arising from the change in the military situation-    This appears in papers of all colours, extending to the Liberals, the Catholics and even to some extent to the Socialists      It is due no doubt to official inspiration, but it has probably a real foundation.     The general conception put forward has been that the German Government ?/as doing its best to use the separate negotiations with Russia so as to make them lead to s general peace on the lines of &quot;no annexations&quot; and &quot;no indemnities&apos;&apos;;   the Government accepted these principles, but accepted them only on condition that the Entente Powers definitely agreed to negotiate on the terms suggested by the Bolsheviks;   if the Entente refuses, as it might be assumed that they would, then the bi.ame will rest entirely.on the Entente, i.e. on England and America;   in that case, the^- v/ill have no one but themselves to blame for what may happen and, to ouote the language of the Vorwarts, &quot;if the war in the West continues, the German soldiers will conduct it with the consciousness that the enemy did not wish it otherwise-, and the deeper hate against
-2-this interminable war will not direct its sting towards Germany., but to the enemy.     The enemy should novv know, and shall know, that it only needed one word on the part of their statesmen to enable them to return to their wives and children in full honour, without damage to their own country.&quot;The Germania, which is important now that we have a Catholic Chancellor, in a message which.-, as it was circulated by the German Wireless, may be taken as expressing the views which the German Government wishes to be believed, suggested that the German Government were struggling to maintain the victory of Right over Might, that they were carrying out the wishes of the Pope, and continued with the warning that the &quot;Western Powers may ponder upon what their Governments have been told often enough by us&apos;, namely, that our forbearance is not unlimited..     It may be the last warning which they are now re-ceiving........Today they have for the last time the choice betweenthe recognition of right and the domination of might;   if they positively desire to hold to the latter, they will have to look out that this does not turn out ruite differently from what their dreams conjure up before them&quot;.The Frankfurter Zeitung as the organ of Finance and liberalism, carefully moderate, in a review of the military situation, openly threatens-France, and in particular speaks of the remorselessness of modern war and the prospect that French districts hitherto untouched will be subjugated to the destruc-tion which has already fallen upon northern France.     Ii the Allies will not accent the opportunity now ooen to them, they must take the consequences.     Owing to the release of troops from the Russian frontier, Germany has again got a great super-iority in men and material;   the English and French will never recover the thoroughly favourable conditions which they had for their general offensives of 1915, 1916 and 1917.      Private people are talking of getting- to Calais and Boulogne, or even to Paris,
This then is the general conception of the situation. The Government accepts the formula &quot;no annexations&quot;, but on con-dition that this is also accepted by the Entente, and if this which is in effect &amp; new offer for negotiations is refused, then they will enforce, as they are now able to do, a military solu-tion.3, On this there are certain points to be observed.First as to the threat.    The German nation are being deliberate-ly worked up to believe in the immediate prospect of a great military success.     his is a very dangerous weapon.    Supposing that the attack takes place and does not lead to the success which is promised, that there are perhaps a few local gains but no decision, no breaking through, no ravaging of French territory hitherto untouched by the war.     here will then inevitably be a groat reaction in Germany;   one similar to that which followed the disappointment arising from the exaggerated hopes placed in the submarine Warfare.     his disappointment will have serious oonseouences.     It is prdbable that the nation is not in the condition to stand a new Verdun.     If the offensive takes place in the early spring end fails after say 6 weeks or 2 months, the failure will coincide with the time when scarcity of food is becoming most serious.    In that case the reaotion in Germany will produce a very critical situation.    On this point they   are playing a very dangerous game.4. Secondly, the success of this policy depends uponthe conviction that it is the Entente Governments who are res-ponsible for the continuance of the war and that the Central Powers have genuinely and honestly made every attempt that could reasonably be expected of them to bring about peace.    This makes the conduct of the negotiations at Brest Litovsk of great importance.
At iirst it appeared that the German and their Allied Governments were conducting them in a spirit of straight-forwardness and reasonableness which seemed to show that there was a new spirit, and that the combination of Eertling, luden*-dorff, Czernin and Kuhlmann would manage things better than their predecessors had done.    They took what obviously was for them the right line.     They accepted the doctrine of &quot;no annexations&quot;, but refused to interpret that in the sense that the&quot; Central Powers should surrender any of the territories over which they themselves ruled.    The German nation could not have been expected to acquiesce in the voluntary surrender of their own territories which had not been concuered in the war. And they were also on strong ground when they made it a con-dition of aooepting the new principle, that they should deal with the Entente as e whole.    They oould not be expected to engage to give up the territory they had won from Russia and which they held as a pledge until they oould be assured that the Western Powers would agree to surrender in exchange, for instance, the German Colonies.     This is particularly important because it must be taken as practically determined that Belgium and at least most of the occupied territories of franco would\ be restored.    They were also on strong ground in saying that the German armies would not be withdrawn from the occupied Russian territories until the Russian army was demobilised. I^ere is probably no precedent for a nation, after a victorious war, surrendering the occupied territories of the enemy until the terms of peace hsve been definitely agreed to, and all danger of r renewed attack h?s been removed.     These points were explained in Count Czernin&apos;s speech of December 25, and in the answer to the Russian proposals-They seem, however, to have made a fatal and characteristic blunder in dealing with the matter of Lithuania,
0 our land, &quot;eto.     It was quite aaae^oe^a:^^negotiations to enter into any details as to the manner in which the voioe of the inhabitants of these districts might be &quot;heard (This very complicated and difficult problem might have been deferred until the larger and governing points explained above had been decided.   .The German Government, however, have appar-ently tried characteristically to out-manoeuvre their adversary; by deserting the path of straight-forward, honest diplomacy, they have ruined their whole case.     It will not be going too far to suggest that in this we can see the handiwork of KtLhlmann. She whole matter is one of the greatest interest and importance, for it is the first illustration of the difficulties that will arise when an attempt is made to put Into practice the principle of the self-determination of nations.    As applied, for instance, to Courland, Esthonia and Livonia, the Germans cannot accept an honest interpretation of this principle which would leave the final decision as to the fate of these provinces to the free vote of a majcEfity of the population, for this would imply the complete surrender by Germany of the &quot;Baltic Baronsn, who hare for bo long been the German outposts by which the Germanisation of Russia has been managed.    If the decision was left until after the German armies had been withdrawn, it would undoubtedly result in de-priving the Barons of their large landed estates, their ruin and dispossession, /tod possibly also their maBsaore, for, in many e  these countries, free self-determination would mean civil war, and a peasant rising against the landlords, especially when the landlords are of a different race from the peasants.    On the other hand, Lenin and. Tretski &quot;cannot allow any indecision or oompromiBe regarding these districts.    The regiments on which they depend for their position in Petrograd comprise considerable numbers of Lettish soldiers;   these letts, who are often well-educated, bi-lingctal, Lutheran, are, just because of their sub-jection to the Baltic &quot;Barons,- confirmed Bolsheviks, and there is
-no district in the world where the principles of the present Russian Government appeal so strongly.5. The Germans, by trying to establish the principlethat a decision had already been made by these provinces when there was no opportunity for a free vote, have shown they do not intend to apply the principle of self-determination honestly; they have thereby brought about the probability of a complete rupture with Trotski and at the same time they will arouse among the Socialists at home all the old suspicion of the influence of the Prussian territorial aristocracy who are closely con-nected in interests and by family ties with the German nobility of these regions.     Oourland and Lithuania are war aims that appeal to Prussia more than to Germany as a whole;   the acquisi-tion of them would strengthen the reactionary elements in Germany. The truth about these districts is that as soon as the Germans arranged for a meeting of notables, the latter&apos;s first act was strongly to protest against the cruelties committed by the German army of occupation, and to demand a free constitutional- assembly. The Military Governor of Lithuania demanded that the Lithuanian Diet should immediately assent, firstly to a permanent military allianoe betv/een Germany and Lithuania, secondly to an economic alliance by which Lithuania should be included in the German Zollverein, and thirdly, to the right of Germany to control the railways and postal system of Lithuania.     The Diet refused to come to cny such decision.     we see in these terms the in-tention to make these provinces practically subject to German control;   they are just like the similar proposals v/hioh at one time were put forward for the future of Belgium.The conclusion of the matter Is that the Germans are prepared to accept the prinoiple of &quot;no annexation&quot;, but they do so not because they believe In it, but merely as a
v/eapon to be used in diplomacy abroad and in politics at home. This policy of using ideas merely as a lever to meet an immediate emergency, is of course one to which every statesman must at times have recourse;    it requires however a subtlety and discre-tion ?/hich the Germans  eem to lack.     We have been able, on the other hand, always to depend on German mistakes to help us out of a difficult situation;   for a short time it appeared as if the new German Government was going to be a more dangerous opponent. They have however quickly shown that this is not so, and it remains true, now as always, that the Germans themselves are the worst enemies of Germany.6. In commenting on the course of the negotiations,the most serious criticism came from the Pen-German press, but on the whole it was, considering their antecedents, unusually moderate.     The chief criticism is based on the fact that the&apos; acceptance of the idea of &quot;no annexations&quot; would, if it were accepted, debar Germany from annexing the Briey mine-fields. This obviously caused much concern, especially in National Liberal^ and 4fce industrial circles.     We are told, and can well believe it, that the industrialists are much more bellicose than the military.     There is said to be a sharp difference between them and Ludendorff.     Probably the key to the whole position is that the army chiefs want peace, and rightly see that negotiationson the basis of &quot;no annexations&quot; would, if they could be carried through, bring a result very satisfactory to Germany.     This would mean a peace on the status quo.     Germany would get back ail her colonies;   Turkey would maintain her integrity, and Germany would in fact be supreme over Europe and the Near East..   The military people and the Government probably see this;   the industrialists and the Pan-Germans are trying to hamper them.     In this connection it is Important to notice that the Colonial question is being put into the front again and the
hopes of the Germans are &quot;being directed towards the attainment of a large African Empire.    We mau assume that there is a general agreement that in view of the favourable situation in Russia they can afford to surrender Belgium.The reported collapse of the negotiations has. however, been greeted with open satisfaction by the Conservative and Nationalist press;   now, they say, we have our hands free again and dan demand the terms which the nation rightly looks for.8. It may be assumed that there will soon be arupture between Trotski and the Germans.    Trotski believes that he can appeal to the German people, that they will rise in answer and overthrow the capitalist and military Government. On the other hand the answer of the Germans will neoessarily be an appeal, secret or open, to the Conservative elements in Russia.    Both countries want peace;   to get peace there must be Governments who understand one another and speak the same language.     It will be the task of the Germans to aid in setting up a Government with nich they can do business, a Government which will open the way to German enterprise and commerce and which will agree with them as to the fate of the West Russian Provinces by an agreement from above.     We shall soon get back to the region of ideas which brought about the partition of Poland.     It does not require a Monarchy to do these things.     i.e may be sure that the Germans do not overrate the importance of the Bolsheviks.     Trotski believes that he is the hero of the great ideas by which the *orld will be regenerated.    To a German soldier diplomatist who cares for these ideas as little as Napoleon did, the truth will be dif-ferent.    Russia has been defeated in war, defeated by the imoompetence of her own Government and the superiority of German arms.    The Revolution is no mote than the natural result of the military defeat;   it is not, as the revolutionists
-9261think, a great achievement;   it is a great catastrophe;   it is the dissolution of society which is one of the results of the defeat. The present rulers of Kussia are men of a kind of which history has many examples.    There is nothing new or great about them; they are merely like the anabaptists or the 5th Monarchy men *r the Jacobins or the Communards.    National disaster allows the dregs to come to the surface.    They cannot remain there long; they can destroy but they cannot create;   give them time and they will destroy themselves as they destroyed what went before;   their permanent power would be death and desolation.    These people are always the same.    It matters not in the least what are the par-tioular principles which they advooate with fanatic ardour. However much these principles may differ in detail, they are always fundamentally anarchical, that is, inconsistent with the e? s1;enoe of the State;   but the State is necessary for human life and, after a struggle, whioh may be short or long, the power of the State re-asserts itself.      The sooner they give way to sensible people, the better for Russia and the better for Germany, for Germany has nothing now to fear from Russia in this war and everything to gain in a future peace.    When there are sensible people in power the future of Poland, Lithuania, etc. will be settled on approved lines;   Germany has defeated Russia, so she will get new territory, but she will want a Bussian alliance in the future, so she will not drive too hard a bargain.    How long this will take we cannot say, it may be weeks, it may be months, or even longer.    This is comparatively unimportant so long as Germany can make peace with or defeat the Western Powers.8. In this connection the event of real importance,more Important that what happens at Brest litovsk, ie the pres-ence of two German Missions at Petrograd, one Naval, the other Civilian;   the Naval is under the control of Baron von Zayserling, a member of a well-known family of Baltic Barons with old connee-tions in Russia.    We may be quite sure that they will leave
?(,?L M Lnotbing undone to restore order in Russia and that they will make themselves the nucleus of a Conservative reaction.     They will hold out everything that can attract, not only the bureaucracy and the officers of the old army, but also the commercial people, manufacturers, bankers, railway companies..    In the long run these people will feel that anything is better than anarchy, even the Germans.9. 2rotski believes that he will be able to overthrowthe German Government.     He looks forward to a revolution in all other countries similar to that which has taken place in Russia. But a revolution of this kind does not take place merely by pressure from below.     It requires a collapse of the Government . first, and the German Government has ilot collapsed and shows no tendency to do so.     Nothing oould destroy it but a military defeat, and it would probably survive even that.Something indeed has happened in Germany.    We can be nuite sure that if those who knew Germany best before the war could now return, they would find a country which they v/ould h^rily recognise.     This we are told from many sides.     But it would be dangerous to argue from this to immediate revolution. The change seems to be in the attitude towards the Government. The people as a whole, the individuals who are fighting in the army or working at home, especially the women, feel themselves to be an essential part of the nation as they have never done before, a part on Which it depends, and in consequence,&quot; they are conscious that they have a right to be considered and consulted as they never had before.     The old attitude that public matters were for the Government and the officials is gone;   the sense of subordination is no longer there.10. Now, this change whioh has certainly taken place,might be the basis of a revolution, but only if two conditions were fulfilled.     First that the &quot;iovernment refused to recognise
the new spirit and tried to suppress it;   secondly that the Government failed and failed disgracefully either in the conduct of the war or in finance, food, economics, etc..There is no evidence that either of these two conditions is present.     As to the first, the Government is obviously aware of the change, recognises and meets it.     There are exceptions, for instance the military control of the censor-ship and the right of public meetings, for soldiers do not understand these things and want to go on in the old way.     If they were unchecked, there would be trouble, but they have not got their own way, and the Government is openly dissociating itself from the reactionary Prussian Conservatives.Secondly, the Government is efficient.     It has conducted and is conducting the war with great ability, and if mistakes have been made, they are not greater than have been made in other countries and always have been and will be made in every country under similar circumstances.     They are not fundamental.     On the whole, the country will not feel that anything in the nature of an upheaval is requisite.     They want a number of detailed reforms and they hope that they will get thorn.The result of this will 3te not a weakened Germany, but a Germany strengthened, because it will be free from some of the most obvious errors of the old system.     It will be a Germany that feels that she has learned much from the war, that she will come out of it purged and renewed from a terrible ordeal, but one which will look to the future with confidence, and in particular will believe that she has shown a real moral and intellectual superiority to all other countries.     In particular the example of Russia will not be an incentive to revolution, but a deterrant.
IX. It is only right to say that this view is nottaken by all.     The opposite has been impressed upon us by one well&quot;acquainted both with Russian and with German revolutionary and socialist opinion and personalities;    it is suggested that the moment the German schemes of conauest and exploitation were unmasked, as they would be during.negotiations, the Bolsheviks would break off negotiations, with the result that the revolu-tionary masses in Germany, including most of the men at the front, would &quot;strike&quot; against the continuance of the war and would bring the German Government to its knees.     Others who know Germany equally well take exactly the opposite view.     Such news as we have from Germany and which has been incorporated in previous reports does not justify the belief in a revolution.No doubt there will be strikes, riots, and even isolated mutinies.     We are told today that 25,000 Germans on the Eastern front have in fact mutinied.     It is nuite probable that there has been difficulty with some regiments;   if there were soldiers on the Eastern front who themselves belonged to the Eastern provinces of Germany, Y/here there is a large Lithuanian and Polish population, the transference of ideas from the Russian army would be inevitable.     We know that the German soldiers dis-like transference from/Bastern to the Western front, for they dread the harder conditions of warfare in Flanders.     It is a long way from this to any serious and general growth of insubor-dination or weakening of moral.     There was a report in the pa?ess that 300 Minority Socialists had been arrested in various towns in Germany.     Ill that we know for certain is that 3 or 4 of the editorial staff of one Socialist paper in Cologne have been arrested.     There is no clear evidence that the German Govern-ment is confronted by anything more than a sporadic and occasional disloyalty of small groups, and this is nothing more than occurs in every country which is at war.
Of course the German Government has many grave dan-gers to meet;   a fresh meeting of the Reichstag under the in-fluence of the Courland and Lithuanian problem, some new outburst from Tirpitz and his followers, increased activity of the Minority Socialists with its consequent reaction on the oiher Parties, above all, any military failure, and the danger of starvation at home.     We can be quite sure that they are aware of these diffi-culties, and for this, among other reasons, are anxious for peace on these or any other possible terms.With regard to the effect on Germany of the allied publication of war aims, the point to which they will look perhaps with more interest than any other, Is a statement as to the con-tinuation of the economic war after the war.     for influencing Genan opinion the fundamental thing is to make clear (1) that economic warfare will be continued with increasing stringency the longer the war lasts, ( ) that if a good peaoe could be made with a reformed Germany, then they could look forward to renewing their external trade on a full equality with the other Powers.
