-3*1.1- ^ . NATIONAL SALVAGE BOARD. 317rSSl7.%l -----MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.I wish strongly to support the suggestion of the President ^  of tho Board of Agriculture that a National Board should be set up by the Cabinet to co-ordinate, supervise and encourage the efforts now being made by various Departments in connection with tho fall utilization of all ?;aste products.My Department is particularly interested in obtaining oils and fats both for edible purposes and in the extraction of glycerine from materials now partly or wholl?/ wasted.   This in the main is a question of utilizing to the full tho waste products of slaughter houses and butchers1 by-products.     The supply of fat for edible purposes is one of the most difficult food problems with which we are faced, and in the execution of the measures I am contemplating for its conservation I shall need the full co-operation of all the other Departments concerned Moreover, as a part of the food economy campaign, considerable success has attended the efforts made to stimulate local efforts in the collection and utilisation of household and other wasteVery valuable work in extracting useful products from waste in connection with the supplies provided for the 4 million men in the Army has already been done by the Army Waste Products Organisation-     It may, however, be desirable, in view of the existing deficiency in the supply of .edible fats, to devote a larger proportion of the material disposed of by the Army to food for human consumption and less to munition production,The problem of dealing with the waste incurred by the 43 millions of the civilian population is much vaster and more complex and will not admit of the uniform treatment possible under Army conditions, though in framing plans for application to civilian waste the advice and assistance of men who have been responsible for the Army scheme will be of the utmost value./For
For the stimulation of local interest and for the adaptation of any central scheme to local needs the machinery of the Local Authorities will be indispensable and consequently the active co-operation of the Local Government Board is essential to success.iviy Department is, of course, as deeply concerned as the Board of Agriculture in securing the fullest possible use of all waste products for fertilizers and for animal food stuffs.I submit, accordingly, the following suggestions for the setting up of a National Salvage Board, and shall be glad if they can be approved by the War Cabinet at an early date:-(1) Constitution of Salvage Board.:There should be set up a National Salvage Board consisting of representatives from each of the following Departments:&apos;Local Government Board&apos; . Ministry of Munitions Board of Agriculture Ministry of Food . Admiralty War Officetogether with a chairman and two others who should be preferably members of Parliament (making a membership of 9 in all),The Board would be appointed by the War Cabinet, and the Chairman should be of Cabinet rank,    A secretary and offices will be needed, and it is suggested that the Local Government Board, as the Department most generally interested, should be asked to provide a Secretary and the necessary office   accommodation.As is indicated in the terms of reference, the Board will act through the Departments and will not, therefore, need a large executive staff of its own. (2) Terms of Reference;The following terms of reference are suggested:To co-ordinate thu work of the existing Government Departments in connection with the conservation/ and
and utilization of waste products and other materials not at present put to their best use, and to secure that all possible measures to this end are taken by tho appropriate department or Departments with a view to economising tonnage and man power * (3) Punc11onjs^ of Salvage Board,The general functions of tho National Salvage Board, as indicated in its terms of reference, will be to make sure that some one Department is taking action to conserve and utilize waste products, and that not more than one Department is doing the same work, and to decide, in case of need,, which Department should do it.     In particular the Board would have to take up the following items of work:-(a) Utilisation of waste products arising in connection with the preparation and consumption of food, esgs the edible oils and fats, dried blood etc, from slaughter houses. ; nd the waste from institutions and ordinary household  * consumption.(b) collection and utilization of waste material of all descriptions such as scrap iron, lead, tin, other metals, wool, leather, paper and so fortho .(4) Powers .The necessary compulsory powers are probably already possessed by one Department or another through the ability to make orders under the Defence of the rtealm Regulations; or, if necessary, could be obtained by an amendment of these Regulations.     This would be a matter for consideration by. the Board when constituted9MINISTRY OF FOOD, RHONDDA,8/1/ 18 ;
