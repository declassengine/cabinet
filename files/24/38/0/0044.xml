CIRCULATED TO IKS KING -AND THE WAR CABINET.FOREIGN OFFICE MINUTES ONS.E. RUSSIA etc.The scanty informstioh which reaches us as to tho progress of events from Vl&amp;divostock to Jassy is so confused; an4 so constantly shifting that it is almost hopeless to attempt anything like a constructive scheme for establishing our position in South-Eastern-Russia, giving Roumania the-essential support due to her, and&apos; denying the wealth of the Ukraine, the Don, the Caucasus, and Siberia to Germany.Up to the present we havo been feeling- our way to a solution on the following lines:-(l)   By financial support to induce the lead a to make Of the Ukraine at the le&amp;st a friendly base on which the Roumanian Army can rest, and to deny ,the Ukraine frontier to Bolshevik and German alike.   This task has been assigned to the French.(2)   More or less in concert with the French to give financial assistance to the Cossacks whose main centro is at Novo Cherkask but who also call for organisation at Akatarinoda..   This if successful would prolong our barrier,from the Ukraine to the Caucasus.(3)   To establish- at Tiflis the head of our- or-ganisation for securing the&apos;support or at least the benevolent neutrality of the South-Eastern Union, which would include not only the various Cossack districts but also the Kalmucks, the Daghe&apos;stanis, the Georgians, and the Armenians.-- The success of this undertaking is our most immediate and vital concern, because it isonly
only by -estafelienlns-aa. Armenian cordon strong enougn to held hack the Turks and the Kurds that we can &apos;  protect the flank of our Mesopotaraian force, hope to keep Persia clear from hostile penetration, and prevent the spread of ah anti ^British I uranian^Mo si era movement, working in German interests, from Turkey into the heart of Central Asia.-(4)   To save the vast accumulation of military stores at Vladivostock from falling into the hands of the BOlsheviki, and to keep Vladivostock and Harbin open, and if possible to extend our influence along the Siberian Railway and thereby eventually establish an Allied line of communication to link Up with the South-Eastern Union in the Ukraine0It must be admitted that the prospects of success for all or even a part of this   rogramme are becoming daily more gloomy.Our latest information is to the effect that on the conclusion of the armistice the Germans can advance when they like and will find the flanks of the Roumanian Army entirely uncovered.   The Roumanian Government are more and  more depressed and Sir C. Barclay says that what feeble chance remains of repair-ing the situation seems to lie in the formation of seme solid Russian unite and in attracting from Southern Russia capable officers to strengthen General Cherbacheii whose poweriassness- is due. primarily to his lack qf reliable officers.   Unfortunately we know that the chance of forming a solid Russian unit for action in Roumania is practically negligible.As
As regards the Ukraine the indications poin;, rather to the Hada being considerably in advance of the Ukraine population and though the provisisk of money may enable them to keep up a show of authority-, probably the utmost that can &quot;toe expected will be to find the Ukraine resisting BOlshevikifrom outside their borders trying to come and take a share of the Ukraine lands.   Moreover, we have no real knowledge of the intentions of the Black Sea Fleet and there is little cr nothing tc encurage us to hope that the &quot;Qoeben&quot; and the &quot;Breslau&quot; could not master the whole Fleet cn the day that they chose to attempt it.In the Cossack country Kaledino and Alexeieff appear to be masters at present and it is possible that something more like an active movement may take shape there0   But Bolshevism has also its followers among the Cossacks, v;a do not know what are the limitations of Kaledine&apos;s and Aloxoioff r*s -resources and th^rc is as yet no indication of a really ecriouc united Cossack movement.In the Caucasus the Daghestanis who control Baku appear to be Bolshevik and Turanian and thsy arc in touch with the even more fanatical Moslems of the Eastern side of the Caspian.   The Georgians have not &apos; definitely declared themselves but the signs *f any rapprochement with the Armenians are not apparent and they are more llkoly to side with the Daghestanis.   The Armenians alone are ready to fight but the Turkish massacres have enormously diminished their military strength and they will be1 fighting, with Turks and Kurdsin
in front, while exposed at any- moment--to a Georgian or Daghestani attack on the rear*As regards Siberia, half the garrison and all the * workmen at Vladivostoek are Bolshevik and there is danger of our military stores heing removed westwards. At Kara in the Chinese have the situation in. hand.   At Chita Bolsheviks and anti-Bolsheviks, are about equally divided.   Most of Irkutsk has been destroyed and the anti-Bolsheviks have for the moment the upper hand but the situation is&quot; likely to change shortly in favour of the Bolshevikso   At Krasnoyarsk the Bolsheviks dominate, the situation,,On the Roumanian front and in the Caucasus, and probably to some extent in the Ukraine and Cossack countries, the situation is complicated by the presence of hundreds of thousands of unpaid soldiers, amenable to no sort of discipline, living on the country where they find themselves and plundering and devastating wherever they gq0The only forces that we can use to meet this situation are:-(l)   Money. ,.(2.)   Armenians, and if we could get hold of them Poles4 for these are the only peoples in Russia who have something definite to fight for and are prepared tofight,   &apos;(3)   An Allied occupation, by Japanese, American, and British troops, of Vladivostock and possibly of the Siberian Railway *So far as can be seen it is impossible under presentconditions.
conditions to provide cash in South-Eastern -Russia. Vie can empower our local Agents to draw Bills upon the Chief Clerk, Foreign Office., or on the Treasury, but the difficulty is to find anybody locally to buy those Bills,   Major Fitzv/il-liams seems to have iseeii able to negotiate Bills  or  500 up to about  30,000, we. hope to provide in the next two months or so about  300,000 worth of silver at Tiflis, and the Treasury find, means here and there of raising a few hundred thousand roubles,   But all this is a mere drop in the ocean of our requirements.   We are asked for 500,000,000 roubles in order to form a new Army in the Caucasus and to liquidate the old one, we must be prepared to assist the French financially in the Ukraine and we shall have to take our share of providing funds for the Cossacks,   There is only one-way by: which it will be possible to do so to the extent required.   We should have to put the&apos; various local Governments into a position which will enable them to raise money among their own peoplo.   That is, we shall have to give them our formal financial guarantee to. a loan.   But this implies definite, and for all practical purposes official, recognition.   This again raises two very serious points for consideration.   Can we give such recognition without a definite rupture with the Government in Petrograd? And Sf we do can we be confident that the local Govern-ments will l^st and not be replaced by Bolshevik commissaries?   If we were sure of the answer to the second question we might, be prepared to risk the firsts The petrograd Government have recognised the right of self-determination of the various units now claiming autonomy, and provided that the South-Eastern Union and the Kada did not move actively against North Hussia,&apos;which
which they would not be in the least likely to eld, we might establish the legitimacy of our action.   The political situation in the Caucasus is, however, so obscure and fluctuating, and the position of the Eada is so indeterminate that it would seem to be the wildest speculation to risk the vast sums that are now called for.   In any case: we must be prepared, to spend large sums of money and we. had better confine our expenditure so far as possible to really definite- ends.I should be inclined to enumerate those ends as follows;.-,-(l).  Support Autranik and his Armenian irregulars. I&apos; have little faith in the materialisation of AvarianoffVs scheme for the creation of 4i Army Corps composed of Russians, Georgians and Armenians, with&apos; Turkish-Armenian and Syrian divisions, but we might be prepared to advance fund$ to our people at Tiflis to enable General Avarianoff., under their control, to evacuate the disorganised Russian troops now in Armenia and the Caucasus.(2)   We should be ready to support Kaledine and    1 Alexeieff.   It is to be hoped that when General de Candolle gets to Noyo. Gherkask we may have a bettver idea, of what is required and of what can be done there.(3)   In spite of doubts as to the real power of the Rada, we must be ready to back up the French in giving him financial assistance-and recognition, for it is the only chance of saving the Roumanian Army.(4)   We must continue to urge on the Americans the immediate and vital necessity of holding Vladivostock,If
if we can get them to Vladivostok we may then be able to continue a move along the Siberian Railway.Concurrently with this action we should work in with General Baratoff and extend om Me s op ot ami an. flank so as to get into touch with the Armenians.&apos;(Signed) G. R. Clerk. 4.-1-18.The above note summarises the situation clearly as it appears In the light of the information at the -disposal of the Russian Committee during the last week. We feel we should be justified in backing a.loan,to the Rada or in assisting the French in the matter, but that we cannot recommend helping the S. E. Federation to raise a loan as its position, power and general sympathies are by no means clear,   a loan would be the only means of supplying funds to anything like an adequate1 amount.   In the meantime all we can do is to authorise our agents to raise what money they can from Persia or by drawing bills locally.and to. dole it out.   We are thus helping the Armenians and are pre-paring to supply them with 150 officers and 300 N..C.O&apos;s  * to organise their forces.   3 officers from the S. Persia Rifles are already on&apos;their way.   As regards the Black Sea Fleet measures are being taken to damage machinery etcdf there seems a likelihood of the ships being handed over to the enemy., - I havo sent this note to the Director of Military&apos;Intelligence for his observations, but it is in general accord with the views of the Committee.(Signed)R. Graham 5.1,18.It
It is very difficult to know what more can he done.   The elements we have to deal With are unsatis-factory and the position not quite but almost hopelessly impossible,. But we must continue to do all we can whatever the cost and however great the difficulties, and I believe the Russia Committee is doing this.(Signed) Hardinge.I am sure the Russian Committee are, doing admirable work,. Hfy only criticism on the above nates is that I . think we must be prepared in the desperate- position in South Russia to take risks *   Instruct, therefore,&quot; our Agents at Iiflife and other places in our sphere that they may raise what -money they can by any me an,; available, and apply it first to help the Armenians and then to Generals Kaledine and Alexeieff. (This is apart from action directed on 2428).. (Signed)R. Cecil.
