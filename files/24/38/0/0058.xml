4hiSECRET. Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. C. 14.Memorandum on The Political and Economic Situation in The Caucasus.1.   The General Political Situation^The welter of local political movement has been very great during recent months, phase succeeding phase in bewildering succession.   Already in August the Tchetehenzi in the Grosnia and vedensky regions (north-eastern Cacuasus) resolved to organise with a view to local autonomy, mainly for the preservation of order.    On a more imposing scale were the later intimations of secession on the part of&apos;the Kuban (north-western Caucasus) with formation of its own government.   The Baku Tatars have also been working out a scheme for the autonomy of the Baku, Erivan and Elizabetpol Governments, which are collectively to be known as Azerbaijan.     Last of all, the A^iministration and Supreme Military Command in the Caucasus have definitely arraigned them-selves against Bolshevism.    (The latest information also shows that the Tiflis Revolutionary Executive Committee of the Soviets have shown little enthusiasm for the Bolshevik triumph in Petrograd and Moscow.   Meeting on November 8 it passed a resolution, the Bolsheviks abstaining, stating that this temporary triumph of Bolshevism at Petrograd would inevitably foster counter-revolution and destroy the liberties acquired by the people. In Novorossisk and Baku the Bolsheviks have, however, taken power into their hands by physical force, but the movement has not been altogether successful in Baku, being opposed by the Mensheviki, Social Revolutionaries and Dashnaktsutiun.     The whole of the
Tiflis press is hostile to the Bolsheviks).   There are indications that seem to adumbrate a definite autonomous Caucasian unit in the Federated Russian Republic.The Georgians, who are a highly sensitive people-, profess to he hurt that Berlin rather than Petrograd has been the first to speak about independence for Georgia.   Still, they conceive Af the recreated Russia as a Federated Republic into which Georgia ought to go as a member with equal rights with the other constituent members, having behind her a long historical experience as a kingdom, a distinctive culture and a compact population of three millions.        Alike with the Armenians and Tatars, the Georgians have been devoting considerable&apos; attention to preparations for the Constituent Assembly.   These preparations involve the elaboration of a declaration setting forth their Individual claims.   In view of the elections for membership to the Assembly the Georgians in particular have not been slow to draw the conclusion from the present condition of Russia that collective activity is an essential for the preservation of the national unity.The Armenian Conference held at Tiflis in October resulted in the formation of a united council of all the parties in the following proportions;   a total of 25 members to comprise 14 from Dashnaktsutiun, 5 from the Armenian Popular Party, 3 fr$m the bloc of Social Democrats and Gintchak, 3 from the Social Revolutionaries. The union has been achieved on the basis of a Russian democratic republic with an eight hours&apos; working day, workmenfs insurance etc. The Council has agreed to work with other nationalities.11. Armenian-Georgian Relations.The relations between Georgians and Armenians, although they have passed through fluctuating phases during the course of the summer and autumn are now distinctly better than In the pre-
revolutionary days.     The Tiflis elections in August seemed, however, temporarily likely to proVide the occasion for a renewed outbreak of the old ill-feeling.   They had been conducted very largely on the general lines of a proletariat versus bourgeoisie appeal, and although the number of Georgian electors was no less than the Armenian, it was found from the nationalist point of view that the Armenians had come out with 48 representatives, the Georgians with 37, the Russians with 21, and so on.   These results were felt by the Georgians to be due to the fact that the Armenians had made a much broader use of the hospitality of the International Party than the others, - a line of action that was resented. It is only fair to state that the democratic Duma thus elected intended to work for the strengthening of solidarity between the different peoples.   The Social Democrats, finding themselves in &quot; power, tended at first, however, to let their actions be determined by their leading principles of internationalism and coalition, understanding by the former not so much agreement between the different national parties as rather privilege for the International, and a preference for the interests of the socialistic parties to those of the national parties, while the idea of coalition got no further than the formation of a bloc with the Social 8evolutionari.es which enabled it to elect to itself seven seats on the Municipal Courts, leaving four for the Non-Socialists and Non-National parties, and one each to the Dashnaktsutiun, Georgian National Democrat, Armenian-Russian-Cadet and Mussulman parties.     The Social Revolutionaries were at first inclined to go in with the Dashnaktsutiun, but when they saw that the Social Democrats were not prepared to make any con-cessions they decided to join them instead.   This extinction of all genuine coalition meant that the servieee of some of the most experienced municipal workers have been lost to the city owing to
9 qo&apos; jI   4. .the use made by the Socialists of their majority in connection with appointment to offices.    The seriousness of the situation caused by the Bolshevik up-rising has, however, driven all the moderate elements into a coalition giving them the majority, and, as the Food Committee has been successful in its distribution the town has remained quiet.11.   Zemstvo Administrative and Other Changes.The question of the introduction of the Zemstvo is of long standing interest in the Caucasus.    For more than ten years a more or less intermittent agitation has been going on, which began after the revolution of 1905, when the local inhabitants thought that they wqjild take the opportunity to institute these well-known forms of economic self-activity.   The Government, however, showed itself intolerant of the suggestion, and in the reaction which followed the idea was completely crushed for the time being.   Once again when their introduction was mooted, the action of the local officials successfully diverted the Intentions of the agitators, but in the autumn of 1916 Mr Rjevsky, a distinguished member of the Duma, was sent down to the Caucasus as Chairman of a small Commission to Investigate the question of tho preparedness of the Caucasus for the introduction of the Zemstvo.     The writer learned in conversation with Mr Rjevsky in June of this year that he considered it necessary to have the Zemstvo there as soon as possible.     He considered that even the Tatars were ready for it, and that it would very probably be a useful instrument in introducing harmony and accord amongst the different populations.        Nothing, however, was done, and it was only natural that the issue should be pressed for solution by those interested in it in the creative days succeeding the &apos; Revolution.     The project prepared by Kr Rjevsky has engaged
000hi *j oThe Georgian church.The Georgian Holy Catholic Church is divided for purposesthe attention of certain local authorities, and there is the certainty that something will now he done on a very democratic basis.   Closely associated with the question of the institution of the Zemstvo is that of the readjustment of the administrative boundaries.   This question proves especially interesting to the Armenians, some of whom deal with it in a very wild way. It has been the occasion of a renewal of old groundless claims for territory, and even of futile attempts to disprove the position of Tiflis as the capital of Georgia.     That the present administrative boundaries are unsatisfactory in many instances, being more ob- less accidental and bearing no relation to the local racial and economic situation, may be admitted.   At the same time the feeling is general that there should be no consideration of purely racial interests in any readjustment. It is a question that ought to be decided in the interests of the population as a whole and not of any particular race, but there will not be so great unanimity in connection with these decisions as in the case of the Introduction of the Zemstvo owing to the opposition In specific cases of Mussulman circles and some of the more democratic Armenian elements.     By means of commissions composed of interested and neutral parties it is hoped to work out the problem satisfactorily.   In any case It looks more and more as if the Armenian centre of gravity will more towards the south In face of the determination of the Georgians to retain their ancient landmarks unimpaired.        Some indication of all this may be seen in the fact that the able ex-Mayor of Tiflis, Khatissoff, has now taken up residence In Alexandropol, the possible centre of the future Armenian State,
of administration into thirteen dioceses, which are in turn sub-divided into circuits and parishes.   Over these are placed various Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops, with a Catholicus Patriarch at the head.   In the month of September a new Patriarch was elected for all Georgia, - Kyrion, late Bishop of Witebsk and Polotsk.   He obtained 240 votes as against 230 cast for Leonid, who was Metropolitan of Tiflis and the Russian Exarch.     Kyrion, born 1854, is a Church historian and homiletic writer who suffered severely at the hands of the Old regime for his loyalty to his Church.        It appears that the Russian Minister of Religion recently communicated the following decision to the Patriarch Kyrion by telegram: *The Russian Provisional Government cancels every kind of credit as from October V . This has been received with lively dissatisfaction and is interpreted as a new kind of repression.Education.The local authorities at Tiflis have extended an invitation to the staff of the evacuated University of Yuriev (Dorpat) to take up residence and carry on the work of the University there.The central    authorities were insisting towards the end of September that instruction in Russian as the language of the Government should be obligatory on all Caucasian scholars in the first class of the Gymnasium and the corresponding class in the higher elementary schools, and that national sections in a school should be only opened in actual relationship to the distribution of the population.     The Georgians are, however, pressing for the nationalisation of schools as a further stage in their successful campaign in regard to the army and the Church.     They want to
nationalise every aspect of Georgian life.   They have recently made all the preparations to open a University of their own in Tiflis on January 1, In which every subject shall be taught in Georgian.   Twenty-seven Georgian professors from Russian and other Universities have intimated their willingness to serve on the staff.   The University will be lodged in the Gymnasium of the Goorgian nobility.   Funds amounting to three million roubles have already been secured.The Land Question.The sequence of events has not shown any change in the dominant ideas of the Georgian peasant.   He stands for private ownership in land more strongly than ever and refuses to listen to any schemes for Its socialisation.   At the same time his voice has been very little heard, for the Georgian Social Democratic party draws its membership mainly from the industrialists.   The Georgian peasants, that is to say, are unwilling to be the foundation elements in a Georgian Social Democracy.   In the present Revolution the main benefits have been so far gained by the industrial and urban populations working entirely for their own hand.   There has been a marked increase in wages, the institution of new unions, sick funds, conciliation boards, etc.   Nothing corresponding to this has been introduced in the peasant life of Georgia simply because the local Sooial Democratic Party is neither a peasant nor a national party. On the other hand the Social Federalists realise much more that the future well-being of Georgia depends on the handling of its peasants&apos; problem, which Is the land.   The Georgians and Tatars are for the most part small peasant proprietors (average holding, three acres or thereabouts), and so are not merely Interested in the principle of private property, but tend to draw together on
that basis.    A very great majority of the Armenians, on the other hand, have no land, so that the idea of its socialisation means a great deal to them.     On this aceount the Dashnaktsutiun have become even more markedly socialistic, while on the other hand the idea of the Soviet or of the Russian Social Revolutionaries is really an intrusion in Georgian life.     Latterly there have been indications of restiveness among the Georgian peasantry and a tendency to speed up the question of the land reform by taking matters into their own hands.   In some quarters they have been expropriating lands, cutting down forests, refusing to pay taxes and seizing public andjprlvate property.     The local revolutionary commissioners and Land Committees have been powerless to stop this lawlessness.     The Georgian authorities are alive to the danger of a repetition of the scenes of 1905, when anarchy in town and village destroyed the revolution, and are endeavouring to mobilise the teachers and other educated people to go amongst the peasantry and instruct them that no seizures of land are lawful previous to the decisions of the Constituent Assembly.II. Economic Conditions.A bread crisis is never far away, although the arrangements in Tiflis and several of the larger towns have proved sufficient up to date.   This year!s harvest was fair in the northern Caucasus but bad elsewhere.     Owing to the local conditions druntoannoss is reappearing on a truly Homeric scale in the northern Caucasus, apparatus for the distillation of spirits being lent from house to house.7.1.18.
