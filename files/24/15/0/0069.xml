                              Intelligence Bureau,                                   Deportment  of  Information,                                           BY/p/004 -                Weekly Report  on Poland.                   (7th June,  1917.)     Prom the point of view of the  Central Powers there  arefour aspects of the final settlement  of the Polish Question:-     (l)    The problem of the  Polish  government  (how  and Whenit is to  be formed, the person of the Regent,  the relations  ofthe new government  to the Central Powers, etc.).     (2)    The question of Austrian Poland  (whether or not  it isto be united to the new Polish Kingdom).     (3)    The question of the boundaries to be  claimed  for  thenew Polish Kingdom  against Russia.     (4)    Of its boundaries against  Prussia.     1,    On May 1  the Polish  Council of State presented anultimatum to the Central Powers.    It demanded that a Recentshould be appointed immediately and the government and ad-ministration of Poland handed  over  to the Poles themselves.   Itdeclared  that in view of the fact that  the Central Powerw havehitherto  failed to  ^ive expression  in deeds to the Act ofNovember  5 &quot;the idea itself of basing the independent PolishState on  a free alliance with  the Central Powers  has been shaken&quot;,                                                         OT)and that  the continued existence of the Council of State -aavA thepresent basis &quot;not  merely does not  contribute  towards establish^ing friendly relations between the  Polish State and the  CentralPowers, but may nip in the bud the  conception  of  a Polish Stateleaning upon the Y/est&quot;.    On May 15,  not having yet received anydefinite  answer, the Council of State decided  to  suspend its
                            -  2 -activities until the receipt of such an  answer,  and  it  summoneda conference of representatives from all over Poland to meet  onMay 24 in order to consider  the political situation.     The official agents of  the Central  Powers most  insistentlybegged the Council of State  at the  sitting of May  15 to remainat its post and intimated that the  final answer  would be  deliveredwithin a few days.     It seems generally accepted that the negotiations  betweenthe Central Powers concerning  a Polish regency and governmenthave advanced considerably,  and there are indications that  theGermans now incline towards  accepting the candidature of  ArchdukeCharles Stephen;  thus for instance  the Warsaw press  has now beenallowed to discuss openly his  candidature,  which it  was not freeto do in the past.   Lvcn so,  serious differences  may yet have tobe overcome in connection with the  transfer of the government andadministration to the Poles  and the future relations of theGerman military authorities  to the  Polish government.     There is no reliable material  to hand to indicate  what hashappened since May 24.     As to internal Polish politics this only can  be said,  thatthe Russian Revolution and the Russian proclamation  of  March 29have profoundly changed the  entire  situation, and  that  the  oldparty divisions,  though not  the personal and party feuds, havevanished to a very large extent.    xfew groupments  are attempted;Conservatives of the type of Archbishop  Kakowski and Prince a.Lubomirski, who had lost considerably in influence owing  to theattitude which they originally took up with regard to the Councilof State, are trying to regain a firm footing in the generalre-shuffling.   All the politicians are  hard at  work, and one cantrace in the newspapers their  busy  intrigues.    The  exact natureof the forces, however,  v/hich  move  them  or frighten  them  is hidden
and. unknown,possibly even to those politicians themselves -  andthis is the one thing really worth knowing.    The Polishpoliticians seem to behave like ants whose hill has been kickedup.   Quite apa.rt from complications of international politicsthey have to watch the forces over v/hich none of them has anycontrol, namely, the public opinion of the country v/hich hasbeen powerfully influenced by the Russian Revolution.   Poland.though at present separated from Russia, remains part of the  EastEuropean voloano.   Its political ant-hill,  although in no way                                     Ownlosing the proud consciousness of its^importance, yet feels  indanger.     2.   It is not clear what stage has been reached in thenegotiations concerning Austrian Poland.    Most of the informationto hand alleges that its inclusion in the new Polish Kingdom hasbeen practically decided upon.   To judge from the attitude  ofthe Polish Parliamentary Club at the opening of the AustrianParliament, if it has been correctly reported in the British press,the matter is still sub ju-Uce.    The Polish Club does not  seemto have come out in strong opposition but apparently continuesto threaten to :lo so in order to prove to those who in Vienna andBerlin oppose the cession of Galicia that its retention withinAustria would create an impossible situation in internal Austrianpolitics.     The following seems to have been approximately the way  inv/hich the Galician crisis has developed:     when on April 16 the Austrian government decided not tocarry through the exclusion of Galicia by an &quot;Octroi&quot;,  a crisisbroke out on a narrow Galician basis.   It was considered in thatlight by the Austrian government and also by the Polish Con-servative leaders, Bobrzynski, the Minister for Galicia,  andBilinski, the President of the Polish Parliamentary Club  in
                           - 4 -Vienna.   The Austrian government tried to meet the crisis bypromises of financial and economic concessions to Galicia,  ofa removal of administrative grievances and finally -ef a promisethat the &quot;exclusion&quot; would be carried out after all.    Bilinski,evidently trying to imitate the political coup of the Germanleaders who did not rely on the promises of a government whichmay disappear at any moment, but had them publicly endorsed bythe Emperor at the interview at Laxenburg on April 19,  arrangedfor a similar public interview at Cracow on May 4; on thisoccasion the Emperor pledged himself to carry out the promise madeby his predecessor in the rescript of November 4, 1916.    WhatHis Excellency M.  de Bilinski does not seem to have realised isthat just as in Russian Poland under the influence of the RussianRevolution public  opinion has gone far beyond that minimum whichwould have previously satisfied it,  so also in Galicia a mere&quot;exclusion&quot; is no  longer considered a proper solution,  but acomplete and immediate union with the Kingdom of Poland is demanded.The Galician problem merges once more in the wider issues of thePolish Question, and the Galician crisis is developing in theclosest connection with the crisis at Warsaw.     Y/hen the Polish Parliamentary Club met in Vienna on May 14 thePolish Question in its widest form v/as raised by the  parties of the&quot;Left&quot;.   Resolutions of the most thorough-going character wereintroduced.   At the opening of the conference M.  de  Bilinskitendered his resignation of the Presidency of the Club.    Theleadership now passed out of the hands of the Conservatives.    Asa matter of fact never since the electoral reform of  1907 have theConservatives had  a majority in the Polish Club,  but  in  the springof 1915 the direction of its policy v/as put into their  hands.   Atthat time the Club considered it necessary to act mainly by meansof diplomatic negotiations with the governments of the  Central
powers; and for such negotiations the Conservatives are best fitted.a3 they dispose of considerable  Court  influences  in Vienna.   Bynow this policy of putt in?;  trust in  Court  influences., etc. hasbecome bankrupt and the  resignation  of M.  de Bilinski marks  itsclose.     On May 16  the Polish Club decided to  pass  into  opposition,this being since 1867  the first  time in  the Parliamentary  historyof Austria that the Poles have taken up  such an attitude.    Thedecision was carried by  the votes of the Socialists,  the Democratsand the Peasants1  Party,  the Conservatives abstaining from voting.It seems that strenuous  attempts were  subsequently made by the                                                       vConservatives to reverse the decision  -  the general  situationremains unclear.   M. Lazarski, who was elected  President of  theClub, is a weak man and  has played a remarkably small part inPolish politics during the  war.    Evidently it  was not theintention  of the Polish  Club to  elect  any  one with a  markedpolitical  past; they have however put  in a man  who,  if need  be,will be led by  the strong men of the &quot;Loft&quot; to  take the necessarysteps.     Again, whatever the politicians may do or  arrange,  thedecisive factor will remain the  public opinion  in the country,and the public  opinion of V/est Galicia is  solid, for a completeand immediate union with Russian Poland.   If the crisis in  RussianPoland is  properly solved it seems unthinkable  that Galicia  shouldbe left out.     3.   One of the reasons wlty no  final  agreement concerningPoland has as yet  been concluded and published  by the CentralPowers is  that  they are  waiting  for  the  outcome of their attemptsto conclude a separate peace with Russia.   If  they lose hopeof obtaining it they are practically certain to include  in thePolish State seme  of the territories in  the East  which are fe-e-iftg
 powers; and for such negotiations the Conservatives are best fitted. a3 they dispose ,of considerable  Court  influences  in Vienna.    By now this policy of putting  trust in  Court  influences., etc. has become bankrupt and the resignation  of K.  de Bilinski marks  its close.     On May  16  the Polish Club decided to  pass  into opposition, this being since 1867 the first  time in  the Parliamentary history of Austria that the Poles have taken up  such an attitude.    The decision was carried by the votes of the Socialists,  the Democrats and the Peasants1  Party,  the  Conservatives abstaining from voting. It seems that strenuous attempts were  subsequently  made by the Conservatives to reverse  the  decision  -  the general situation remains unclear.   M. Lazarski, who was elected  President of  the Club,  is a weak man and has played a remarkably email part inPolish politics during the  war.    Evidently it  was  not the intention of the Polish Club  to  elect  any  one with  a  markedpolitical past; they have however put  in a man  who, if need  be,will be led  by  the strong men of the &quot;Left&quot; to  take the necessary eteps.     Again,  whatever the  politicians may do or  arrange, the decisive factor will remain the  public opinion  in the country, and the public  opinion of West Galicia is  solid for a complete and immediate union with  Russian Poland.   If the crisis in  RussianPoland is properly solved it  seems unthinkable  that Galicia  shouldbe left out.     3.   One of the reasons  wh;y  no  final  agreement concerningPoland has as yet  been concluded and published  by the  CentralPowers is that  they are waiting  for  the  outcome of  their attempts to conclude  a separate peace  with Russia.   If  they lose hope Qf obtaining it they are  practically certain to include in theRelish State seme  of the  territories in  the East which are fee&amp;tg
claimed &quot;by the Polish Imperialists, more  particularly Central and astern Lithuania.    There are  certain  indications  that  they  arepreparing for the possibility of  such a move.    As  Russia hasalready acknowledged Polish independence  within  the limits ofethnographic Poland  some  new  incentive  has  to he provided whichwould make the Poles fi^ht against Russia.   Such an incentivev/ill probably be sought  in an offer  of  territories  I7hich the  PolishImperialists claim hut which  the  Russians,  in fairness to them-selves and to the other nationalities inhabiting those territories,could never concede  to the Poles.     4.   If the administration of Poland is handed over to thePoles and a Regent  is appointed it may  become necessary  for theGermans to define the boundaries  which  they are  prepared to con-cede to Polana in the west.    It  would  seem likely  that  the Germanswill for strategical reasons  claim a  strip  of land  in northernPoland, especially  in the governments of  Lomzha  and Suvalki,  andfor economic reaso..n possibly also chan&amp;es  of frontier in the coaldistrict round Czestochowa (such  a change would  however  bedisastrous to Poland and  would  be bitterly  opposed).   To avoidappearances of &quot;annexations&quot;  they may perhaps offer some in-significant frontier rectifications  in  Posnania.    These,  however,are mere conjectures, and so  far  there  are  no certain indicationsconcerning the German intentions  in that  direction.                                     LB1-T.                                         7/6/17.
