SECRET.       As the 10 batteries ef British heavy artilleryhave been for some weeks in Italy now and have taken partin the rscont offensive on the Julian front, tha moment seemssuitable to endeaveur to give seme idea of how the transportwas effected, where and how the batteries were employed andwhat tne result has been.       The constitution of the force is, in same respects,very fortunate.   It would net be easy to find a commanderbetter suited for the purpose than Brig.-General P.D.Hamiitcn;R.A., C.M.G.    This officer besides having had a wideexperience of similar artillery work in France, has jier^om\lcharacteristics which are of particular value under thepresent circumstances.   He is very tactful in hie dealingswith the Italians and rocegnisos the importance, besidesiTorking his artillery w*ll, of establishing tho best possiblerelations with the Italian army.       In this he has beon entirely successful.  He makesfull allowances for differences in temperament and practiceand is net in the least put out by constant changes of ordersand other rather trying characteristics cf the Italiancommand.   He has inculcated on his group and batterycommanders the same spirit of determination to take offence -at nothing and to regard everything coming from the Italianauthorities as being well and kindly meant, as indeed it is.       The result *f his quiet and tactful attitude is thatItalian Commanders feel that he has ne desire whatever toassume a superior air or to try to toach them - a thing v/hichseme of thorn may have been a little afraid of at first, perhapsowing to contact with certain French Officers.   He isconsequently, gradually and quietly, increasing his authoritywith the Italian officers who recognise his competence and

They are, therefore,  the more ready to  consult  him and, I foresee, will gradually be quite willing  to be guided  by him in matters in which they tacitly recognise  that his experience and  practical knowledge are greater than theirs.      The two Group Commanders, Lieut-Colonel Meberly and Liout- Oolonel Buzzard, are also admirable selections professionally  and they, too, get on extremely well with their Italian colleagues. The battery commanders also appear to be entirely satisfactory.      The Administrative Headquarters Staff of the batteries is composed of officers who, severally, are quite efficient in their duties.     Some sf them know Italian and all of  them are on excellent terms with such of their Italian colleagues  as they are brought into contact with,  Generally speaking, the relate ions between officers and men of the British artillery and those of the Italian Army could not be improved upon and are most satisfactory in every way.  There are only a very few men  in thewhole force whose behaviour is not satisfactory and, as it isnst worth while to run the  risk of having the harmony between the British and Italian troops disturbed by a few ill-behaved individuals, steps will be  taken for dealing with these.       General Hamilton and his staff were welcomed in themost friendly fashion by all the Italian commanders and staffs.General Hamilton himself has had the honour of being commanded to dine with His Majesty the King, at His Majesty!s Fieldquarters near Udine.  He has been received by General Cadorna at the Ccmandc Supreme in Udine and General Cadorna,with General Porro and his  personal staff,  has visited the batteries of the No. 2 Group at Pec and intends to visit  the NO: 1 Group as soon as he can.       H. R. H. The Duke of Aosta has invited General Hamilton to lunch and dinner and has been most kind and
                              3. ?&apos;    &apos;          &apos;   &apos;appreciative towards him and,  like  all other General andStaff officers from the King and General Cadcrna downwards,has repeatedly expressed his great  satisfaction at thepresence of the British batteries at the Italian frontand with their work in the field.         The transport of the batteries to Italy was carriedout with as much expedition and punctuality as was to beexpected under the circumstances.  The feeding cf the trocpsduring the journey seems to have been quite satisfactory andbeyond the men being rather tired and dirty after so manydays in the train, there appear to  have been no avoidableInconveniences,         The only unfortunate incident connected with thejourney was that one of the trains,  whilst standing at thestation of San Kartino della Battaglia, was run into by agoods train from behind.  Five men  were hurt,  three of themrather badly,  some cartridges  were  burnt and a wagon waspractically demolished.  The Italian authorities werevery much concerned at the incident and at once orderedan enquiry to be held into the circumstances.   A copy ofthe proceedings of the Court of Enquiry will be forwardedto me as soon as completed.         Before leaving England General Hamilton hadparticularly requested that the Group Commanders and Staffsof each Group should be forwarded in the first train ofeach Grcup for the obvious reason that it was  important forthe Commander and staff of each Group to be ready tc receivethe batteries on arrival.  For 3ome reason, perhapsunavoidable, this arrangement was not carried out and theCommander and Staff cf each Group arrived in each casein the last train, instead of in the first.   This causeda certain amouub of administrative  inconvenience which moresatisfactory dispositions would have avoided.         The fact chat the transports, as far  as thepersonnel was concerned, were satisfactorily carried outis proved by the fact that, except  in the case of thefirst few batteries, the guns.were&quot; in their positions on
 the  Car so within 10 to 12 hours of the arrival of the       229 trains conveying them at Cervignanc   This promptness of movement appoars to have impressed the Italian authorities very favourably.      The transport of the ammunition was unluckily subject to some delays over v/hich the British authorities had no control.   It appeared that on the French railways difficulties were raised about the despatch of the complete rounds. The  result was that shells would be received at one time and  cartridges, tubes, etc., at another.   The delays may also have been partly due to the composition of the trains having to be changed at Liodane.   Trains of only 20 vehicles can  be passed through the tunnel, to be united later on into the  normal Italian trains of 40 vehicles.   This v/as another inconvenience, as tho French trains are composed of 50 vehicles.   Again on the Italian railway system there was  at the moment a very heavy traffic in consequence of the preparations for the offensive on the Julian front. It is probable that the ammunition could not have been forwarded with greater expedition without interfering with and partially suspending, the normal civilian traffic in                                          4 Northern Italy and this the amount of British ammunition passing did not justify.        General Cadorna decided to allot the 10 batteries of heavy artillery to the Illrd Army because this army was about to bear the largest share in the impending offensive; also because the terrain on the front of the Illrd Armymore nearly resembled that to which the British Artillery Commanders had been accustomed -&apos;   in France than any other on the whole of the Italian front.       Palmancva, a small fortress dating back to thomiddle of the 18th century, v/as selected as railhead for the British batteries.   Here excellent sites were at&apos;onoe allotted for the ordnance depots and other stores.  Some of these v/ero placed in the old magazines of the fortress or in new temporary constructions just Inside.      The
accommodation was ample and excellent and the Italianlocal authorities havo done everything in their powerfor the convenience of the British batteries.        From Palmanova a light railway runs to Gradisca,where are the Headquarters of the Xlth Army-Corps to whichthe Administrative Headquarters of the British Artilleryis attached.   No.l Group, under the command of Liuet-ColonelMoberley, is allotted to the Xlllth Army-Corps of which theHeadquarters are at Turriacco, while No,2 Group, Lieut-Colonel Buzzard, is attached to the Xlth Army-Corps.        Excellent arrangements have been made by bothCorps for the accommodation of the officers and men.  GeneralHamilton has been allotted a villa, called the Castello,next door to the Artillery Command Office at Gradisca for hisoffice. ,  The house is very convenient for the purpose andhas accommodation for some of the Administrative staff aswell as for the officers.  Telephones, etc., were at onceinstalled and the arrangements made could not be improvedupon.        Another house, about 100 yards off and standingin very nice grounds, was allotted to General Hamilton asa mess and as quarters for the other officers of theAdministrative Headquarters.  About 500 yards out or Gradisca,to the North of the town, the Villa Freifeld was placed atGeneral Hamilton&apos;s disposal as a hospital.  The accommodationis good and the site is excellent, but suffers thedisadvantage of being shared by a motor park and an Ordnanceworkshop which, consequently and legitimately, attracts theoccasional fire of the Austrian batteries.    After onebombardment, which fortunately caused no casualties,  thepatients were evacuated into tents a little distance  awayand it is under consideration to establish the hospitalpermanently on a safer site.        It is unsatisfactory that a properly equippedfield hospital was not sent out with the batteries.Major Elliott, the Medical Officer in chargo,  hae made  the
                      6-                                231best arrangements he can under the circumstances,but it would be better for the troops and more creditableto British prestige if complete equipment, proportionateto a force of the size,  could be cent out.  There havebeen,  up to the present, 12 deaths and 32 men woundedand, on May 27th, there were 67 patients in all,  inhospital.  The deaths are not all casualties in actionand the batteries have been really a little unlucky.  Threeor&apos;fcur men were killed by a bomb dropped from an aeroplane;one man was drowned while washing some clothes in theIsonzo; cne man was killed and. I understand, two woundedby an Italian gun bursting while in action in rear ofthe batteries;  two men were severely injured by oneof them striking his foot acoidently against a rustedhand-grenade that had been lying in the grass, probablysince  last August; three men were injured in the  railwayaccident at San Martino della Battaglia.  The number ofmen actually killed and wounded in action is thus not largeand it is to be hoped that the list of accidentalinjuries is now closed.       The workshops of the batteries are also to beestablished at the Villa Freifeld and for this purposethe site is probably suitable.        The rationing of the troops is entirelysatisfactory on the whole.  The Italian authorities havetaken a good deal of trouble to ensure that the Britishtroops get a full equivalent for the British ration andin fact almost the whole British ration itself.  The menappear tc like their rations very much and seemedextremely well and cheerful.  The only drawback to therationing is that the quality of the meat is not  quiteso good as in England,  but this cannot be helped  as themeat in Italy is not so good as in Northern Europe *On the other hand a higher value is being obtained fromthe rations by the employment of Italian cooks who are betterthan the average British soldier cooksc
          As the organisation of the mechanical transport inthe Italian Army is entirely different to that for the Britishforces in France, it was found advisable to refrain from in-sisting on the supply of motor lorries and vehicles on the scalelaid down for corresponding units serving in France.          The amount of motor transport with the Italian     wu,vArmy is very small indeed, as compared with that employedwith the British armies in France.          With the Italian Army the motor transport iscontrolled by tho Army Commands and is only furnished tothe batteries of heavy artillery on requisition for specifiedmovements.  Thus the Illrd Army, which has some 800 heavyguns, lias only about 150 motor tractors for. moving theguns.   It was clearly impracticable to insist on tractors,as laid down on the British scale, being assigned to theexclusive use of 10 British batteries.          The excellent and complete system of roads allover the area occupied by the Italian army makes it possibleto do all the work that is required with a very much smallernumber of tractors and lorries than are required in France,Thus it has been possible to reduce the total number ofmotor vehicles required for the exclusive use of theBritish batteries to 14 lorries and 12 motor cars - a totalof 26 vehicles (including those required for the workshop )instead of 206.          General Hamilton informed me that ho calculates thotime required to take the ammunition up to the batteries atone-fifth of the time required under similar conditions in France.          On arrival the batteries of the two Groups wereat once placed in the positions previously assigned to themfor participation in the coming offensive on the Julianfront.   Fortunately 20,000 rounds had come out with thobatteries.  In an irregular and fragmentary fashion aboutanother 15,000 rounds had arrived up to May 27th.   In allthe batteries fired 35,000 rounds up to May 27th.,  orclose upon 900 rounds per gun.   The positions taken up at
                            8-                               2first by No.l Group were not altered, but No.2 Groupwas shifted forward from its first position to a secondposition near Pec, as shewn in the enclosed map.        The preliminary firing of the batteries and theregistration of the targets was very satisfactorily concluded.Both the Group Commanders reported that they themselves hadbeen surprised at the quickness with which good accuracy wasattained, in spite of the fact that all the guns were newand the greater part of the personnel were new to the work.The result, I consider, throws great credit on all concerned.From first to last only one gun was put out of action for afew hours which proves that care and skill must have beenused in looking after the materiel.  The good result 5s  alsolargely due, probably, to the fact that the batteries havethe advantage of the technical supervision and skill of anexcellent Inspector of Ordnance Machinery,         The ammunition sent out appears to be of excellentquality.   The shooting was very regular, the explosive effectof the lydite shells on the rocky ground v/as excellent, thefuzes are very good and the number of blind shells less thanone per cent of the total.         The Italian Artillery officers are enthusiasticin their praise of the weapon, of the shooting and of theeffect of the shells.        The Austrians appeared to realise very soon thata now weapon was being used against them, although they havefor several months past,  been fired at with British six-inchshells from the Naval Guns t.    Telephone interceptions andthe statements of prisoners  proved that they fully appreciatedthe power of the British howitzers.         More than one interception shewed that the  Austriantroops had been instructed that the British shells  containeda poisonous mixture which made it necessary to wear  masksin the trenches being shelled by the British batteries.
     The principal targets allotted to the Britishbatteries are indicated in the attached map..  These wereattacked as directed by the Commanders of the Italianartillery Groupments to which the British Groups were attachedf.     On 12th May the destructive fire on the trenches wascommenced and continued until the infantry advance began atnoon on the 14th.  The infantry of the Xlth Corps of theIllrd Army advanced at the same time as the infantry of theGorizia Army.  Later the batteries were employed in barragefire and in attacking individual targets as required and.  onthe morning of May 25rd, began the second general bombard-ment, for destruction, before the advance of the infantryalong the whole front of the Illrd Army.     On May 24th the ammunition for the British,batteriesran short and only commenced to arrive in any quantityagain on May 28th, when the general action was practicallyover.  This was unfortunate, as, although the action of10 batteries is not likely to have made much differenceto the general results, yet there is reason to believethat the extra 2,000 yards of effective range of theBritish howitzers as compared with the correspondingItalian weapon,  might just have enabled the Italian forcesto have made good their hold on Selo and the important lineof defences running from Selo towards Castagnevizza. However,probably, all that was possible to get the ammunition up,wasdone by the Italian railway authorities.  It is to be hopedthat, in future,  there will always be a sufficient reserveof ammunition in hand with the batteries to avoid any riskof the supply running short during an action.  I considerthat the supply in hand should never be allowed to fallbelow 40,000 rounds.                (Signed), C.DELME-RADCLIPFE.                                 Brigadier-General.   Comando Supremo,        Italy.
