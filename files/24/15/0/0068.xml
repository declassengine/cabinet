SECRETG.T.967WAR CABINET.BASE METALS.        There is a danger or valuable mining properties atpresent in British ownership in neutral countries passing underthe control of American groups whose interests are in reality-centred in Germany through their.affiliation to the great GermanMetal Combine        At present no powers exist to prevent British Companiesfrom selling their interests in such properties to any neutral.        In view of the importance  of conserving as far aspossible such interests as we do at present possess in theWorld&apos;a resources of base metals and of the avowed intentionof the Germans to make good, by the purchase of mining pro-perties in neutral countries, the  loss of the raw materialsfor which they were formerly dependent on the British Empire,it is desirable that some control  OTJB r the sale by the BritishCompanies of their mining properties abroad should, if possible,be established.        An account of the present  situation with concreteinstances of transactions which it is desirable to check willbe found in the accompanying memorandum.        The sanction of the War Cabinet is asked for the pre-paration of a measure giving Eis Majesty^ Government power toprohibit the alienation to foreigners of mining propertiesabroad owned by British subjects unless the consent of HisMajesty1s Government has first been obtained.                       (Initialled)  E.M.P.5/6/17.MEMORANDUM.      The war has made public property a fact which, prior to1914, was only perhaps realised by those directiveonnectedwS^-mining and smelting businesses, i.e, thatJCterman miningand smelting combines, chiefly with their seat &quot;/Frankfurt, havegradually secured such a chain of organisations in variousoountriea that they practically dominate the base metalindustry of the world.   The war appears to have scarcely affeo-ted this control with the exception, perhaps of Australia,where stringent legislation has freed the. metal industries ofthe Commonwealth from German domination.  It appears incrediblethat, under present day conditions, German Companies are stillin a position to acquire and control British owned properties,but they are still attempting to do so (and in some cases nodoubt have succeeded) through the German-American Companies inthe United States with which they are closely affiliated, inwhich they hold capital and are represented in many oasesthrough interlocking directorates.      The accompanying chart, which has been extracted fromthe &quot;Report on Co-operation in American Export Trade&quot; publish-ed in 1916 by the United States, Government, shows very graphic-ally the close connection existing between the Frankfurt
2261Companies and the  German-American metal organisations of theUnited States..      The American Metal Company,  with a capital of  700,000,is closely affiliated as the chart shows - with the MetallGesellschaft  of  Frankfurt,  with a capital of  900,000, and alsoi^ith the Metallbank  and Metallurgische Gesellschaf t, also ofFrankfurt,  capital  2,000,000..      It is said that a large part of the stock of the AmericanMetal Co. is  held  by the two Gorman Companies and these latterare therefore understood to have a direct voice, if not acontrol, in its  management.      There are  other large German metal combines, such as BoerSondheimer, Aron Hirsch and Solim,  which have extensive ramifica-tions in the  United  States, and it may be said, therefore, thatthe German metal companies, in spite of the state of warexisting to-day, are free  to pursue their endeavours, under theshelter of their affiliated American groups, to capture import-ant British and  other mining properties throughout the world.      The American Metal Co. had been and is very activelyengaged in buying  up mining companies in the American Continentand two cases have recently come to the notice of H.K.G. inwhich British owners have  asked the F..T.D.. if there was anyobjection to  their accepting favourable offers which they hadreceived for their properties from the American Company.                                                     One ofthese properties was in Chile, of relatively small importance,but the other,  situated in Mexico, was of greater value.  Itbelongs to the Mazapil Copper Co., Ltd, an English Companywith a capital of   ^00,000 and the offor received from theAmerican Company amounted  to some  1,300,000.   Both theproperties in question consist of copper mines which it is ofgreat importance to  keep under British control owing to thecomparatively poor resources of the British Empire as regardsthis metal.   With regard  to the offer received by theMazapil Copper Co.. H.II.Ambassador at Washington reported thatthe sale should  be prevented thy every available means, as byits acquisition  the  American Metal Co. would practically completetheir hold on the  production of base metals in the northerndistricts of  Mexico..      A letter lately intercepted by the Censor states thatrecent German activities  in Mexican mines have as an object&quot;to replace into German hands those metals which they wereSetting before the war from the British and their Colonies&quot;.      In order effectively to counter the schemes of the Gormanorganisations to dominate  the world!s base metal supply, itv/ould appear to  be necessary to oppose it by a similar comblna-tion of the large  base metal interests throughout tho Empire andit is understood that the  Board of Trade is at present consider-ing the steps to be  taken  to secure such a fusion of/interests.With such a combination it would not only be possible to checkthe German activities but  a British combine of the magnitudocontemplated would have sufficient power in capital and out-put to compete successfully with the American organisations,and would be in a  position to offer at least equal prices forthe acquisition of important new properties and bo able tokeep a staff of  engineers  in different parts of the worldreporting on opportunities for the investment of the capitalresources of the combine.    It is only by such an organisationthat Great Britain and her Colonies will be able to chock anddefeat what threatens to become a German domination and the con-sequent fixing of  prices of the world&apos;s base metal supply.
       In the meantime it is obviously of tho greatestimportance to prevent British owned properties passing outof British control into that of the German American and othergroups.  His Majesty1s Government however do not at presentpossess powers under which such Gales can he prevented and inthe two cases cited above all the action it ?,as possible totake was neoeosarily confined to an urgent request to theDireotors not to accept, on patriotic grounds, what to them wereundoubtedly mry favourable of  rs.      It is oertainlfr a matter of extreme urgency that thisunsatisfactory situation should be remedied with a view tocreating a powerful British organisation for the future, andtherefore that steps may be taken with the least possible delayto give His Majesty&apos;s Government the necessary power to secureby law that the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government must &quot;teeobtained for the sale or alienation to foreigners of any Britishowned mining property or of the controlling interest in suchproperty, wherever situated.(Initialled)    E.M.P.,5/6/17.
