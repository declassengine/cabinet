SECRET.      This  paper is the  property ofHJYL Government and  is  subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets  Act.BOARD OF INVENTION AND RESEARCH.Victory House,     Cockspur Street, S.W.B.I.R. 17268/17.          Memorandum on Submarine Hunting,                              by Professor W. H. Bragg, F.R.S.,                               Resident Director of Research,                              Experimental Station, Parkeston                                        Quay,  Harwich.   The  accompanying memorandum  has been  drawnup to show the outlook from a certain point of view onthe  subject  of  anti-submarine  warfare as  it  hasdeveloped  up to  date, in consequence of the investiga-tions of the Board of Invention and Research and of theirconsideration of information from all available sources.It is put into the form of a suggested scheme of tactics.This is done, in  the  first place, because it  proposes aplan of operations for the anti-submarine forces of theNavy.  It  goes without  saying  that, when a plan  isadopted, each subsidiary device can be examined as apart of the scheme,  and improvements follow rapidly,whether as the result  of practice  at sea or test in thelaboratory.   Secondly, it has  been  thought better to frame amemorandum such as this rather  than  to  detail theseparate researches  conducted by  the  Board,  if thework of the Board is to be explained.  A large numberof researches have been conducted, but though all  ofthem have a bearing on the subject of the memorandum,they have  been mentioned in it very  briefly or not at all.As examples may be cited  various forms of mine,automatic, non-automatic,  non-sweepable, methods  ofsignalling  and the like.  On these and other subjectsseparate reports have been submitted and are availableat any time.   The Board cannot, unaided, put to the test the planssuggested  in the  memorandum.   Operations  on a largescale are required, such as  can be  carried out by theNavy alone or with its fullest  co-operation.  The greatpoint is that once experimental  work has been fullyconsidered beforehand, the most  economical method  isthat which spends freely  for the  purpose  aimed  at.The Board itself has experienced the waste of time andability consequent on lack of  ships, buildings, andequipment, and, at the risk of wearisomeness. it seemsright to press continually for the conception of large-scale experiments.     o (33) AS 3173  Pk BIR 205 100  5/17  EiS          A
    The experimental work which has been carried outduring the  last 12 months  by the Board  of Inventionand Research, taken in conjunction with results alreadyknown,  and  with  many suggestions  from  outside,suggests certain general conclusions which may now beset out and examined.    It is not suggested that experimental work  is at anend, but rather that the time has come to enlarge itsscale in certain directions.    Flotillas should be used in place of single ships, thearea of operations should  be wider than the few squaremiles of water round the  experimental station, and thetrials  should be  made with the  co-operation of expe-rienced naval officers.Definition of  &quot; Density of Distribution &quot; of  Submarines, and       its importance.    The choice of a method of hunting submarines mustdepend on what may be called the u density of distribu-tion of submarines.&quot; Enemy submarines are  scatteredover the  seas,  the  number in a  given  area beinginaccurately known, but sufficiently well for certainrough  calculations.    Let us take the area of the waters  about the BritishIsles as  400,000  square miles, this  being intended tocover  the narrow  seas and a  certain fringe  of  theAtlantic  (see Appendix by  Mr. Hilliar, B.I.R. 12,940).Suppose there  are &quot; n &quot; submarines in this area at anyone moment, and let it be assumed provisionally  thatevery  part of  the area is equally likely  to  contain asubmarine.  This is not true, of course, but it  is wellto take the simple  case first and to make allowancesafterwards.    Suppose  that a hunting vessel  steams for an hour atan  average  speed of 10 miles, and  can make sure ofdetecting any submarine  within  a  certain distance of&quot;x&quot; miles on either  side of it.  It has swept an  areaof 20 x square miles in the hour, and the chance of oneof the  &quot; n &quot; submarines being in that area is                 20 X n X x _   nx                 400,000  &quot; 20,000&apos;    If,  for example, there  were 40 submarines and &quot;x &quot;were a mile, the chance  would  be  1 in  500; that isto say, the searching vessel  would detect  a submarineabout once in 500 hours, or  three weeks, if the searchwere continuous  and detection were certain  providedthat the vessel passed within a prescribed  range of  thesubmarine.    If  500  vessels  were  engaged in the search   thechances would be more like  one in an hour under  thesame  conditions.   If only one  hour in four could  beconsidered as a working hour, which would be reason-able after alloAving for weather, need for relief, and soon, a  submarine would  come  within the range of  asearching vessel once every four hours.  If the encounterled certainly to destruction the  anti-submarine  warfarewould  certainly be going well.   But if &quot; x &quot; were only one-twentieth of  a mile, as itwould be if  the search were conducted by means of  asweep,  then the chances  of  encounter would be only
one-twentieth  of  these, and would be too  small to  beuseful.   And yet, even in this case, if the density of distri-bution  were  much  greater,   the chances  might  berestored tc their  former value.  If it were known, forexample, that one  submarine was lying in a  certainarea of 500 square miles,  the  chance  that one  suchsearching vessel as already described should come acrossit in an hour is                    lOXjV......   1                     500   &quot; 500&apos;and if,  say, 25 vessels were  turned on to it, they wouldbe fairly certain of  finding it in a day.   It is easy to work out  the chance of discovery forany  particular arrangements,  remembering  that  it  isequal to                        2Nn,.rV                         A               (see Mr. Hilliar&apos;s note),where jST is the number of  searching vessels, n  of sub-marines, and A is the area within which the submarinesare known to  lie.   The velocity of the searching vesselsis Y, and the lane which it sweeps with the certaintyof detecting  any submarine vessel lying within it isassumed to have  a width of  2x.Relation of &quot;Density  of Distribution&quot;  to  &quot;Range  of       Detection.&quot;   The general conclusion is  that with such numbersof submarines and  searching vessels as may be assumedwith fair  accuracy  to  be distributed over the Britishwaters, that is to say, with  what we may call &quot; normaldistribution,&quot; there is no use in hunting unless x is some-thing like  a mile.  But if the density of distribution is&quot;abnormal,&quot; say  twenty times as  great, as it might bein special  cases  of  crowded channels or  trapped sub-marines,  then it would be worth hunting  when x ismuch smaller, that is  to say, the range of  action of  thedetecting method is much shorter.Methods of Detection and their Ranges.   This has a most important bearing on the considera-tion of  the  relative value of the various methods  ofdetection which may be used in hunting-vessels, whetherthese latter are on the sea, or under the sea, or in theair.    Take first the  case when  the hunter  is a vesselkeeping the surface of the sea, and consider the  variousmethods of detecting the presence  of a submarine withina given distance on either side.   If a submarine  is to be detected  it must cause achange in some physical  condition,  which  is to  bedetected by the senses of the crew of- the hunter, aided.or unaided by instrumental means.  In some way orother the submarine  must  make itself  seen or  felt orheard, directly or indirectly.  Take the various possi-bilities  in turn.Vision.   There is the chance of seeing a periscope directly, achance which, may  be expected  to be very small whenthe hunting vessels make  so  much noise  and  can  be
seen from so far  as is usual at present.   The expecta-tion is confirmed by experience.    The possible  range  of vision is great enough.  Aperiscope might be seen at even a mile, but the certaintyof  detecting a submarine within that range is  verysmall, because  the  submarine is extremely unlikely togive itself away  by showing more than  the minimumof periscope.  Moreover, it is generally  supposed thatGerman submarines have orders to avoid all fightingvessels.  Consequently, methods of  direct vision  fromthe hunting vessel cannot be counted on, and no furtherreference  need be made to them.  There is, however,the possibility of employing vision from a seaplane orobservation balloon ; but this is a question demandingseparate treatment,  which may be deferred for thepresent.Detection by Feeling.    Next may  be considered methods of detection  by&quot;feeling&quot; that  is,  by  contact with sweeps or trailers.The  range of  these methods is so short that in thegeneral case  the chance  of  successful  search is toosmall to be effectively useful.   It  is true  tliat  whenthere is an  encounter  it  is fairly  certain to lead todetection, but the x of the formula  previously stated istoo small.   Only when  the  density of  distribution ofsubmarines is much higher, say twenty times, than thenormal is there likely to be much use in  such methods.Abnormal  distributions do occur,  and  it is right toconsider what is the best form of sweep in such cases,but consideration of this point also may be deferred.Detection by Electro-Magnetic Means.    There are certain other methods  of detection, whichmay be considered next, and for the most part quicklydismissed.  They depend  on the electrical or magneticdisturbances that a submarine may cause as a conductoror as a mass of iron.    According  to well-known  laws,  such disturbancesfall off  inversely as  the cube of the distance from the submarine.  The statement is  subject  to qualifications in certain cases, but roughly it is  true, and a serious hindrance to the use of  such methods.   At distances of one or two  hundred feet the effects are so small that instruments of  some delicacy  are  required  to detect them, and though the delicacy of electrical measurement can  be pushed  to an  extraordinary degree, and the disturbance due  to a submarine might be measured  at much  greater distances than  those  just named, the necessary  instrumental refinement would be  impractic- able under sea conditions.  This applies generally to a variety of methods which  suggest  themselves;  for example :     (a)  The alteration in the electrical resistance between           two points, due to the presence in the neigh-           bourhood  of  a  conducting  body  like   a           submarine hull.    (b)  The influence of the iron hull  on the magnetic           constants in  its neighbourhood.    (c)  The effect of the moving iron hull  in  causing           induced currents in stationary  coils.
   (d)  The  alteration  in  the inductance of stationary          coils  due to  the  presence  of  the  iron          conductor.   Since the range of these effects is so  small, they areof no use in a general hunt, when the density of  distri-bution of submarines  is small.  When  the density  ishigh the situation is different.  The consideration of theproper means of dealing with abnormal densities hasalready been deferred.Acoustic Methods of Detection.   Lastly, we  come  to methods of hearing.   If weinclude with the sound waves which are audible  thosewaves which, are too frequent  or too infrequent to beheard, we cover a wride range of disturbances which areof the same nature as  sound waves and follow similarlawrs,  though,  the means   of  detection   may   differconsiderably.    The most important  feature of  these  methods  ofdetection is that their range is so considerable, beingmuch greater than that of any other when circumstancesare favourable, and rarely less even when circumstancesare unfavourable.    Much attention has been paid  to them during thewrar, and  the  general conclusions may be  stated  asfollows :     In calm weather,  and   in  the absence of  serious disturbance originating in  the observing ship,  a sub-marine moving slowly under water can be detected oneto two miles  away; if the  submarine  is at full speed,the  distance increases  to two or three miles.    If the observing ship is moving at more than two orthree  knots,  or if its  machinery is noisjr, or if  theweather is  bad, these  distances are materially reduced.When, therefore, the circumstances are favourable, therange of detection is of the  order which makes it worthwhile to hunt when the  density  of   distribution  of submarines is normal.    It is the only method of which this can be said. Acoustic Instruments.    It is not necessary to discuss at any length the nature of the acoustic instruments.  It may be stated merely that there are both listening  plates which can be inserted in the hull, and also separate instruments which can be lowered over the  side.  Also  the very important point must  be observed that  these  instruments  indicate not only the existence of a source of sound, but also the direction from which it comes.  When, therefore, two or more  boats act in concert,  it is  possible to locate  by cross bearings the actual position of the submarine.     Successful trials of a combined chase of  a submarine by  a flotilla of  motor launches have been made at Portsmouth,  and  a trial  by  a flotilla of  trawlers  at Milford Haven failed only  because  of the insufficient speed of the trawlers and not because of  any fault in the acoustic instruments or of the tactics employed.     Since this is the only method which has any chance of being employed with success in a general hunt for submarines, it is right to go into it more fully. Tactics of Acoustic Methods.    The tactics will instantly approximate to the &quot; drive &quot; such as is used in hunting certain game; it is analogous     o AS 3173                                    B
to the methods employed in the later stages of theSouth African War.   It is decided to sweep a certain area of sea, probablyone in which the density of distribution of submarinesis likely to be high.  A fleet of suitable vessels is flungout in a line, and spaced  at intervals of about a mile.At  a signal, the vessels stop  as quickly as possible,reversing their engines to do  so,  shut  off  all noisymachinery, and lower their listening gear overboard (ormake use of their listening plates as the case may be).At a signal they start off again, move on a mile and tryagain.  If a  submarine  is heard by  any  one of theflotilla, the signal is given to all and the CommandingOfficer of the flotilla directs the chase in the  approxi-mate direction.   If all  goes well, more than one vesselwill soon hear, and cross bearings will be found whichwill locate the exact spot.  The vessels close round anddrop depth  charges or use other  suitable means  ofdestruction.    This is the method which has been  proved to  bepossible  by the motor launch trials at Portsmouth.Conditions of Success.    The same  trials have emphasised the importance ofcertain conditions of success.    In the first place it is clear that the tactical trainingmust  be good.  The  boats must move as  one  unit.Otherwise the noise of those in motion will spoil thelistening of those at rest.    Secondly, a good method of signalling is required.Probably the  best  would  be  the  wireless telephonywhich Captain Round recently demonstrated at Harwich.The range was about 10  or 20  miles, which would  beample  for  the  present  purpose.   There  are othermethods  which would  serve,  the main considerationbeing speed,  and reliability of sending simple signalsrather than range or the power to handle long messages.    In the third place, vessels should have sufficientaverage  speed to overtake a submarine trying to getaway  under water, even  when  they have  to stop tolisten.   As submarines may travel  at eight  knots ormore  at  full speed, the chasers must be capable oftravelling at a much higher rate.  It is a circumstancein favour of  the chasers that the faster the  submarinetries to escape the easier it is to hear, and the  stops forlistening may be a  little less frequent.    Motor  launches  are quite effective in smooth  seas.In  rough weather no listening  can  be done, but it isprobable that effective listening can  be carried outwhen motor launches cannot be  used  conveniently.Trawlers are not fast  enough.  It  is  true  that  theiraverage speed, including the  stops for listening, isgreater than the usual under-water speed of a submarine,but they cannot catch the latter if it puts on full speed,as was shown in the trawlers trials at Milford Haven.    It may prove that  P boats are  admirably adapted.It has been found on trial that a P boat can be stoppedand started in four minutes.  If a stop is made everymile, the average speed can be shown to  be reducedfrom about 20 knots to 10 knots, which latter  speed isquite  enough.  Probably  it would  be unnecessary tostop  every mile if  the submarine  were moving  fast,and, therefore, easily heard.
   The times of stopping and re-starting all  engineswould he diminished if certain auxiliary engines couldbe so insulated and well balanced as not to communicatetheir vibrations to the  mill.  It has been found that invery calm weather a submarine  moving  slowly underwater is heard a mile and a half away when most of theauxiliary machinery of  a P boat is not stopped.   Lastly,  the  listening  personnel should  be  welltrained.   Under-wrater listening  is  really an  art forwhich some men have quicker ears than others, and allrequire practice.   The trained human ear is so  muchsuperior  to any mechanical means  of  detecting  thevibrations of  sound, that the whole  effort of designersof the listening instruments has been directed towardsthe transmission of  sound from  the water  to  the earwith  as little modification as possible.   It  is all themore necessary that the ear should be trained to getthe best resulcs.Tactics of the Submarine.   Let us now turn to  the  other side and consider howa submarine would best endeavour to escape.   If it keeps on moving,  it is  practically  certain tobe caught.   If it  has  once moved and been detected, its chancesof escape are still much less  than if  it had  lain  quiet.For  the pursuers will now know that there is  a sub-marine within a given  area of no great extent, and willproceed  to  adopt the  methods  appropriate  to  the&quot; abnormal density &quot; distribution.   If  it does not move  while  the chasing fleet ispassing,  and so  escapes detection,  it will probablyescape altogether.    Undoubtedly the proper  plan for the submarine isto lie still if it  hears  or in any way becomes aware ofthe  approaching  fleet.   It  might  happen  that theGerman submarines will take time  to learn this  move,or will sometimes give  themselves  away even if theyknow it.  The trial is  well worth it, even if the fleet isnot silent.    It might  be  possible to  &quot;flush&quot; a submarine by acontinued dropping of small charges.   Hearing  theexplosions  coming nearer  and nearer, the  submarinemight be frightened into getting under way.Countering the Tactics of the Submarine.    But it wrould be best to consider how to counter themove described.  The only way to  make  sure that thesubmarines do not sight the searching fleet  is to forcethem down (by  seaplanes).  It wrould in any  case beproper to send  a seaplane ahead of the fleet in orderto miss no chance of seeing a submarine from above.   It is  much more difficult to ensure  that the  sub-marines  do not  hear  the approaching fleet and takewarning.   The  only thorough method is to make thefleet noiseless.   If the  condition were absolute, P boatswould be ruled  out; but, as already said, in default ofother vessels, it would  be  well worth while to maketrial use with them.  Paddle steamers are  difficult tohear under water, and it would be well worth while totest their capabilities  as hunters.   Their quickness instopping and starting would  be  all in their favour, andthey would give steady platforms.
   It remains to be seen whether a jobble on the seawould make enough noise among the paddles when atrest to interfere with the listening.   Again it might he possible to design boats specially.They might be provided with air propellers, whether astheir normal or only as an auxiliary method of propul-sion.   In this case  the submarine could not hear themat all, and being unaware of the necessity to stop allengines and lie quiet, would, therefore, be detected.Use of Seaplanes.   It has been found by actual trial that a seaplane canalight on the water, put down and use a direction-findingapparatus, take it up, and fly away.  The most suitabledesign for the control apparatus is not yet determined,but  several are being  made  for  trial  according to  adesign  which embodies what experience  has  alreadybeen gained.   It is, of course, only in calm weather that a seaplanecan  manoeuvre on the  surface of  the sea;  but in suchweather it will have certain great advantages.   Imagine a squadron of seaplanes setting out in fineweather to carry out a sweep.   If a submarine is sighted,a seaplane can drop bombs in the usual way, unless oruntil the submarine dives.   If  the submarine  seeksrefuse  under water, one or more seaplanes can  alightand   listen, taxi along the surface and listen again.They can keep in touch  while  calling up patrols ifrequired.  If  nothing  is heard and it  is inferred thatthe  submarine  has gone to the  bottom, then  the&quot;abnormal density&quot; methods  can be employed.   But  if no submarine is sighted while the seaplanesmove to their stations, then at least the submarine, ifthere is one about,  has gone under, or better still, hasnot  observed, them.   The seaplanes  then proceed tocarry out an  organised sweep in the manner alreadydescribed as proper to  surface vessels.   They have this  advantage over surface vessels, thattheir movements are inaudible below  water, and thesubmarine cannot  know what they are doing withoutcoming to the surface.  If it does so. this implies, notonly that the submarine is in motion and can be heard,but  that it runs the risk of being  detected by one ormore seaplanes which may  stay in  the  air  for thepurpose.    The seaplane would be the most effective of all means of attacking  the submarine were it able to  ali&amp;ht or arise from the surface  of the sea more easily than it can in its present stage of development.  The reason is that, once the submarine has been driven under, it can neither detect  nor attack the  seaplane, while the seaplane can detect, follow up, and attack the submarine, so long as acoustic means can be employed.    It is possible that  seaplanes might be modified for this special  purpose,  even that  it might  be  well to sacrifice their powers  of flying, at any rate of flying well.  If they  could  no longer take to the air, they could  be worked  advantageously in  conjunction with ordinary seaplanes. Submarines as Chasing  Vessels.    The possibility of  using submarines to chase sub- marines must also be considered.
   It is not  to be expected  that they  should be soadaptable to combined work  as  other  vessels.  For,either they must keep on the surface, in which case theyare inferior to surface vessels proper, or  else they workbelow the surface, in which case the difficulties of com-bination are practically insuperable.   The submarine has certain special  powers  whichmust not  be overlooked.   When submerged entirely,the noise of water dashing against the hull is eliminatedand hearing is good.   Captain Waistellhas stated that on a recent occasiona C boat chased a German submarine for an hour and ahalf  by sound only, losing it iinally for want of speed.Development of a System.   The above  considerations point to the  conclusionthat  the &quot;rounding up&quot;  methods which they describeoffer an opportunity for the  orderly development ofa  regular  system  of  tactics having reasonable pros-pects of success.   It would seem  urgently desirableto try them now  when the  fine weather, which offersthe  best  opportunities, may  be  expected for  somemonths to  come.  They  should be  tried  with fullyequipped flotillas, and subsequently with specially builtboats if need be,  writh  officers practised  in  the  propermovements and  with trained listeners.   It is  certainthat great improvements would be made  as the result ofconstant practice,  not least  because  an  ordered policywill  lead to concentration and combination of ingenuity.   When the system is grasped as a whole, each part isseen in its relation to the  rest and is developed with  adefinite aim.   Tactics,  listening, signalling, insulationof machinery, special construction, form separate depart-ruents,  in each of  which progress can be made  for  thegood of the whole.   There  is no other  way of searching for enemy sub-marines which gives reasonable prospects of encounterwhen the distribution is of normal density.  It may bew-ell to put this statement once more into  quantitativeform.    Ten ships  reckoning on  hearing up  to half a mileand working for 12 hours at  an average rate of 10 knotswould cover an area of 1,200 square miles in that time.If there was one submarine to every 10,000 square milesthe  flotilla would have a chance of catching a submarine in that period of about one  in eight. There are areas known to  the Navy where the densitj^ of distribution  isconsiderably higher than one to 10,000 square miles. Abnormal Distribution.     Finally let us consider the case of abnormal, distri- bution when, for example, it is known that  a submarine is lying within a  certain restricted area, perhaps as the result of such a chase as has been described.  -   It is now desired to explode a charge close enough to the  submarine  to put it out of action.  Of all the various methods that have been tried probably the most efficient is the magnetic trailer.  It consists of a pernia- nent magnet, which may be quite  small, towed at the end of an electric cable and  carrying a small coil which the cable  connects to an indicator or relay on the towing vessel. If the magnet comes in contact with a mass  of iron, a current is induced  in  the  coil  and the fact  iso AS 3173c
May 15th, 1917.indicated on  board, or, as the case may be, the relaycloses a circuit and fires a charge attached to the magnet.The charge used need not be large, because the explo-sion must occur within a few inches of the submarine. -  The apparatus is very simple and certain in  itsaction and it  is affected and  fired by iron only.   It issmall and handy, and it is expected, though it has notyet beeri proved by experiment, that several sets can betowed from one boat using kites or two boats tising asweep wire,  so that a wide  lane can  be swept at onetime.
APPENDIX. Chances of Discovery of Submarines  by               Listening  Patrols.   The utilisation  of  direction-finders in service is amatter for the  A.S.D., but considerations as to theirpossible  effectiveness  against the  submarine  menaceare naturally of interest to B.I.R., if only as an indicationof how much weight should be attached to the acousticmethod.   The following remarks are  iherefore put forward,although somewhat obvious, because the point of viewis one which does not seem to have been considered upto the present by B.I.R.   Supposing there are n submarines in an area A,  andthat N patrol  boats cruising  at  an average speed V arefitted  with listening  apparatus which  will  detect asubmerged submarine  under average conditions  at adistance r.  For haphazard distribution and courses ofthe  submarines and patrol boats, the  number of timesthat a submarine will be found in time T is                          A   &apos;&quot;&apos;    The  North  Sea, Channel, Irish  Sea, an,d a  strip of the  Atlantic extending for a width of 150 miles along the  shores of  the British  Isles  and France represent a total  area of about 400,000 square miles.   Suppose that this  area  contained 50 German submarines and  was swept at  random  by 400 acoustic  patrol boats, having an  average speed including  stoppages  to listen of 5 knots, and a  listening radius of half a mile.  These boats might be  supposed  to slow down and  listen  once every 10 minutes.   On these assumptions the chances of discovery work out at the very considerable figure of six  submarines in  24 hours     In one way the conditions would be more favourable than  those assumed, because it would  be known that certain  localities  are  more  frequented by submarines than  others, but on the  other  hand the supposition of haphazard courses is  misleading.   One  might make a similar calculation of  the number of collisions between pedestrians in Trafalgar  Square, and the result would not be in  any relation to the truth, because people avoid one another, and  similarly the  submarine might make it a rule to get away from a  patrol boat and  keep out of hearing.     If, however,  the  patrol  boats  executed organised sweeps in converging lines, each  boat  at  rather  less than twice the effective listening distance from the  next, this  difficulty would  not  arise, and the  above formula  would be valid.     There seems  no  reason why  sweeps of  this  sort  should not be  effective, since  the  greater part of the  waters  in question would  apparently be too deep  for  the submarine to lie quietly  on the bottom and so escape  notice.     * More exactly V should be replaced by v/V2 + v&apos;J, v being the  speed of the submarine submerged. This,  however, is hardly worth  taking into account, and docs not come at all into the case of organised  sweeps referred to later.
   The discovery of submarines is only a part of theproblem  of destroying  them, but  so  far as discoveryalone  is  concerned,  it  seems  permissible  to  affirmdefinitely that the acoustic method, with the instrumentsat present developed, should be  capable of giving resultsof great  importance, and  that  the mere  extent of theinfested  seas is not in itself  sufficient  to render themethod ineffectual.                               H. W. HILLIAR,                                      1 May 1917.
