      Commanding-in-Chief, British Salonika Force.,To,    The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,      War Office, London. S,Wn                                             Salonika,.                                        26 th, May. 1917,Sir,      I have the honour to forward for your informationa short account of the operations which have taken placein this theatre since the commencement of the month,  Asregards the initiation and execution of the whole ofthese operations I desire to make the following remarks,h    It was not until the end of February that 1 wasinformed that a general offensive was to be undertakenon this front and that the date fixed was the first weekin April,  On previously asking General Sarraii for hisproposals for the future he had informed me that anyoffensive was out of the question owing to the state ofGreece,2.    The plan for the offensive so far as the Britisharmy was concerned was drawn up without my knowledge andI had to inform General Sarraii that, owing to the stateof the Seres road due to the wet winter, operations of anymagnitude in the Struma Valley were out of the questionby the beginning of April. Moreover the railway plant forthe Salonika - Guvezne railway had not yet arrived fromEngland, An offensive on the Doiran - Vardar front wastherefore decided on0                                          3.Preparations/
                                                                  if                                                                173       30     Preparations for this offensive were hurried on but(      the time was insufficient more especially as one infantry       brigade was retained at Katerini until 10th March, but by       3rd April it was possible to commence operations and, as I       considered it advisable to conduct the initial operations       under cover of darkness, I selected the 10th April on which       date the moon was suitable.       4*     I then learned that the French and Serbians were far       from ready in the loop of the Cerna and that the operations       in front of Monastir and west of Lake Prespa had been stopped.       The date of the general offensive was now put baok to the end       of April.  Later General Sarraii decided that the British       should attack on the 24th and that the operations of the       other allies should begin on the 26th.  His reasons for this       were that the British Government desired an early offensive.       5,     It was not until after that attack took place that I       discovered that the French and Serbians were not yet ready,       Undoubtedly climatic conditions were against them but later       information shows me that sufficient time had not been allowed       for preparation; in fact even their artillery registration       had not commenced.       6.     I therefore determined to postpone further operations       until I was certain the other armies were ready, and General       Sarraii notified the 8th as the date of their infantry attack,       On that date I  sgain attacked and continued ray operations with       the troops at my disposal until orders to cease the offensive       were received.
                  3.7.   Apparently however on the west considerable frictionhad arisen between the allies.  The Serbians and Italianscomplain that they have not been supported by the French.The French staff on the other hand generally accuse theSerbian Command of not meaning to attack in earnest.Two French divisions were kept in Reserve and never employed,even when by their employment there appeared a chance ofsuccess.   Throughout the whole of the operations thereappeared to be a lack of co-ordination by the Higher Command,-and the time required for initial preparation had not beentaken into account.8.     The operations conducted by the British army appear tohave had the desired effect as two new Bulgarian regimentswere marked down on the Vardar front and possibly a brigadeof the 1st Division was also drawn into that area in additionto much heavy artillery.   Considerable losses weT-c Inflictedon the enemy.                          I have the honour to be,                                   Sir,                            Your obedient Servant,                                   GEO. F.  IMILNE.                                     Lieutenant-General,                                     Commanding-in-Chief,                                  British Salonika Force.
8 A  flJL (3 JL                       175G.H.Q., Salonika. N0.545/12G,Summary of operations by the Allied Forces         at Salonika  -  May 1917.British Force.         At the commencement of the month the divisionsof this Force were holding the front from the mouth of theStruma River to the Vardar in the same manner as wasreported in last month&apos;s summary.   West of Doiran Lake,however, certain changes of infantry brigades had takenplace in order to relieve the troops that had borne thebrunt of the fighting on 24th April and following days.         On 2nd May I received orders from General Sarraiithat my second attack, with a view to drawing to the eastof the Vardar hostile reserves in rear of the Cerna area,should take place at an early date, as the allied attackin that vicinity had been ordered for the 8th.   I thereforeissued orders that the infantry attack should be carried outon that day.         This attack was undertaken by (from right to left)the 26th, 22nd and part of the 60th Divisions.   The                             thoperations of the 22nd and 60 Divisions were entirelysuccessful in advancing their line 500 yards on a front of2 miles on the west of P. Ridge,  and in seizing and holdingGoldie&apos;s Hill as an advanced post.   On the right the-26thDivision attacked the enemy&apos;s front line near Doiran Lakewhich had been previously subjected to a systematicbombardment for several days.  The leading troops succeededin entering the trenches opposite to them but such anintense barrage was then put down by the enemy that thesupporting troops were unable to make any headway.  Thosewho had got forward fought with extreme gallantry andrepelled several hostile counter attacks but were eventually                                                    forced
forced back to their own trenches.  In part of this linefighting continued on the Petit Couronne until 2 p,m.on the following day when the troops on it fell back owingto the inability of reinforcing that position.  The groundgained ?fest of P.Ridge was further increased on the 15th,and again on the 20th, and was consolidated.   Althoughthe enemy tried to recapture parts of it all attemptsfailed.         Preparations for a further advance west of theridge were at once commenced and arrangements made for the60th Division to replace the 26th in the operations to beundertaken against Doiran,         In the Strums. Valley the 16th Corps was orderedto push forward its line and to make preparations for anattack on Ernekoi with a view to threatening the Rupel Passand keeping up pressure against the Bulgarians on that front.As each of my divisions is there responsible for holdinga line about 15 miles in length, I was able to spare onlyone brigade for this attack.  Operations commenced on the15th, Kjupri was seized and a series of intermediatetrenches known as the Perdie and Essex trenches lyingbetween Ernekoi and the River Struma were captured, 96prisoners being taken.  The ground so won was consolidatedand held in spite of counter attacks.  I then issued ordersfor the attack on Ernekoi and Spatovo to take place on the26th, but on the 24th I had to cancel these on receipt oforders from General Sarrail to cease offensive operations.s&quot;est of the River Vardar.         On this front the 122nd French Division and the1st Division of the Veniselist army had been allotted asimilar role to the British force namely, to exert suchpressure against the Bulgar forces opposed to them as waspossible in view of the long line held by them.

In the south of the loop wasa composite French division under the orders of theFrench Commander-in-Chief on the whole Monastir front, whilestill further south at Eksisu was the French 30th Divisionin reserve under General Sarrail&apos;s orders.  During theMonth the 2nd Veniselist Division which had arrivedfrom the Grecian Islands was sent to the vicinity of Verria.         The main operations which should have commencedon 26th April had been postponed owing to climatic andother reasons and were eventually ordered to commenceon the 8th May on v/hich date the 2nd Serbian Army made asmall advance towards Kozjak.  The French attack was furtherpostponed until the next day as the artillery preparationwas reported to be insufficient.  On the 9th the generalattack by the French, Italians and Russians in the Cernaloop took place, and portions of the enemy&apos;s front trencheswere captured but were subsequently lost in counter attacks.A second attack by the Italians was not supported by theFrench and severe losses were incurred.         On the 10th May the Serbian 2nd Army made someslight progress towards Hill 1824 2 miles east of Sokol.On this and the following day the Italians made two                                           isolated/
