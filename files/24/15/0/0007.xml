               SECTION D.                  DBW/007.     WEEKLY REPORT  ON BULGARIA.  VII.              June  1, 1917.     On May 21 and  22 the  Bulgarian Socialist Delegation hada Conference with the Permanent  Dutch Scandinavian Committee inStockholm.   As was expected the Delegation put forwardpractically the official Bulgarian Nationalist programme andmaintained  the necessity for &quot;the amalgamation of all thedistricts  inhabited by Bulgarians under Bulgarian rule&quot;.One of the  members  of the  Delegation, Sakarov, interviewedby Dagens Nyheter,  declared that the Bulgarian Socialists hadthe same views about peace without annexations as the GermanSocialists.   Dr  Sakarov presumably meant the German MajoritySocialists, for he  and his party are certainly not againstannexations.    He  went  on to say: &quot;?:e must, of course, haveback Dobrogea&quot;.  He also argues  that in the past Bulgarianspresent enemies had acknowledged her title to Macedonia as aBulgarian  country.   This had been stated by the CarnegieCommission, and Mr  Milyukov recognised the same fact after avisit to Macedonia.     These  Bulgarian &quot;Broad&quot; Socialist Delegates have naturallyattempted  to defend the  full Bulgarian Nationalist programme onracial and equitable grounds. This is necessary if they areto conciliate  the feeling  of neutralist Socialist circles inStockholm,  and even that  of the international pacifist wingof the Socialist  party  in  Bulgaria.  At least two members ofthis party, the &quot;Narrow&quot; Socialists,  - Kolarov and Kirkov -also went  to Stockholm.  But nothing has been published as to
their negotiations.  Their  programme  is  summed up in a veryclear leading article  in  their  organ  the Rabotnicheski Vestnikof Hay  12,  called  &quot;National Self -Determination&apos;1.   The papercordially endorses the principle  of national self-determinationas formulated by the Russian Socialists, but it makes twostriking reservations  as  to the complete application of thisprinciple to a European settlement.   It  says in the firstplace that  it is impossible to  apply  this principle completelywithout seriously damaging.the  social and economic interests ofvarious countries  and  of  the civilised world as a.whole, thusputting back all real  social progress for many decades.Secondly, national self-determination, so far as it is practicable,should  certainly be carried out,  but  it  should be subordinatedto the  far  more important principle of international federation.This principle is  so far  recognised only by InternationalSocialists, but it must be  admitted by the world as a wholebefore  permanent peace is possible.   The article takes asexamples of the application of  these  principles Austria-Hungary,the Balkans and Russia.   As it  is there  are eight nationalitiesin the  first, six  in the  second,  and.at  least ten importantand many unimportant nationalities in the third.   Any attemptto erect independent States on  the basis of this principlewithout consideration  for the interests  of the community asa whole would be damaging to the  cause of progress.  &quot;Is thatto say  that we must go back to  the situation before the war?Certainly not.  Russia has  already declared in favour of afederated republic;  the  same thing must happen in Austria-Hungary and the Balkans&quot;.     These  International  Socialist views are, of course, notshared  by other Bulgarian parties, even  by the Broad Socialists
now representing Bulgaria at Stockholm.   The intention of theselatter is undoubtedly under cover of idealistic statements toadvance the strongest case possible for  the recognition ofBulgaria&apos;s claims.   They have gone there with the full knowledgeand approval of Tsar Ferdinand&apos;s Government  and Of those of theCentral Povrers.  There is no sign that while they claim thefoundation of a Great Bulgaria on what they call racial lines,they would be willing to see a Jugoslavia and a Great Rumaniaerected on the same  basis.  The utmost they have publicly statedis their readiness to accept the restoration of Belgium, Serbia,Rumaniajian^Montenegro.     There does not  seem to have been any mention by them, orif so it has not been published, of Bulgaria&apos;s claims on theMorava Valley.  But  there is no doubt that these claims will bediscreetly and tenaciously championed.   The Bulgarian press ispaying very great attention to the future of the Morava Valley,which represents to  them not only a rich field for exploitation,but an essential link in their future connection with CentralEurope.  A new book  has  just (May 17) appeared by one Zanetovcalled &quot;The Bulgarians of the Morava&quot;, which attempts to showonce again that the  population of this district was originallyand ought still to be Bulgar.  The Bulgarian authorities arecertainly attempting to  rectify the, to  them, unfortunate factthat the population  is certainly not predominantly, or even to alarge extent, Bulgarian.  On May 25 there was to be a bigConference of all the district prefects  of the Morava provinceunder the presidency of  Zlatanov, Secretary-General of theMinistry of the Interior.  It would probably be a safe guessto conclude that the chief subject discussed will have been howbest to complete and hasten the Bulgarisation of the provincewhich for a year past ha? been viporously carried forward.
I1   ! !  !Economic Conditions in Bulgaria.     In view of the approach of the harvest the Director ofFood Supplies,  General Protogerov,  has published new regulationsas to the food  rations allowed.     From May 25 onwards agricultural labourers as well asindustrial workmen and artisans will be allowed a daily rationof 800 grammes  of cereals or 650 grammes of flour,  The restof the population will be allowed only their old rations of500 grammes of  cereals or 420 of flour per day.     The urban  population from May 25 to July 31 will be allowed5 kilos of wheat for cooking.     Those who  have a stock of cereals or flour in excess arerequested to hand them over to the  Commissions of Requisitionafter deducting what they require for their own maintenanceaccording to the proportions now fixed, and it is hoped therewill be a prompt response to this appeal on the part ofpatriotic citizens.     Those who  possess adequate cereals or flour for their needswill not from May 25 onwards enjoy  the bread ration daily issuedby the bakeries, unless they prefer to take this ration and handover the stocks they possess.     The Director of Food Supplies  has  ordered that all stockshanded over should be paid for at fixed prices.     So far there seems to be no  comment on these newregulations.                                           A.K.A.L.                                              June 1, 1917.
