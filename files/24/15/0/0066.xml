7/Gen.Ho./6333*              The Position and Prospects of Recruiting.              &quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.          The accompanying. Memorandum by the Adjutant-Generalwas submitted to the Army Council and has been carefullyconsidered by them.          Prom what is stated in the Memorandum it seems clearthat,  practicalljr, the Army is no-&quot;; provided with men onlyafter all other needs of the Nation have been cared for.Unless this policy is changed, the strength of the Army willcontinue rapidly to diminish, and, so far as military opera-tions are. concerned, our chances of winning the war will becorrespondingly reduced.          Various factors other than those of a purelymilitary character are obviously  of great importance in theprosecution of the war,  but at the same time the hard factremains that the war cannot be won unless our achievementsinclude the defeat or exhaustion of the enemy&apos;s militaryforces, and this cannot possibly be accomplished if our ownmilitary forces are not maintained at adequate strength.          While pressing for the measures outlined in theMemorandum, the Council believe that no completely satis-factory solution of the question of Han-Power will be obtaineduntil it is found ^cssible to adopt a system of generalliability to National Service, as suggested by the MilitaryMembers in their Memorandum of 2c.th November last.

MEMORANDUM BY THE  ADJUTANT-GENERAL REGARDING      THE POSITION AND PROSPECTS OF RECRUITING.                                   Part I.    1. The provision of men for the Army has fallen and is  still falling so seriouslybelow requirements that I am compelled to ask that  the  question may again  receivethe attention of the Army Council.  In France alone, on 12th May, the divisions  were82,783 below strength, while the outlook with regard to recruiting is even worse  thanthat of the supply of drafts.    2. On  6th  April, 1916, the Army  Council expressed the opinion that &quot;thecircumstances attending the war  are  such as to  render  it absolutely necessary thatevery man of military age who is physically fit, and can be spared from naval service orindustrial or other indispensable employment, should be made available for service in themilitary forces.&quot;    3. In May,  1916,  the Military  Service  Act (Session 2),  1916, became law.   InJuly,  1916, I reported to the Secretary of State  that, in my  opinion, it had  becomenecessary to create a   Man-Power  Distribution  Board in order to  co-ordinate  theactivities of Government Departments in regard  to  the utilization of man  power.   Isketched out  the powers which, in  my  opinion, it  was necessary  for the Board topossess.   This was circulated to the Cabinet  by the then Secretary of State for War on2nd August, 1916.    4. On 12th September, 1916, the War Committee  further discussed the questionof the Man-Power Distribution Board, and  the  Chief of the  Imperial General  Staffpressed the great urgency of this question, and made a statement to the effect that therecruiting outlook was the reverse of satisfactory.  He quoted figures to show the needfor action.    The War Committee decided that the  Man-Power Distribution  Board should getto work as soon as possible.    5. On 22nd September, 1916, the Army Council forwarded  to the Man-PowerDistribution Board a complete statement of the recruiting position as it existed on the16th of that month.  (Memorandum &quot; Army Needs and Available Man Power.&quot;)    On this information the Man-Power  Distribution Board delivered reports to theWar Committee on 3rd and 17th October and 9th November,, 1916.    To the third report certain Departments refused  to agree, and  it became evidentthat further steps were  necessary.    6. On 28th November, 1916, the Military Members of the Army Council presenteda Memorandum  to  the Secretary of State  for  War emphasizing the  necessity  ofproviding men for the Army and pointing  out that the question had  several times beenunder consideration of the War Committee without avail.    In this Memorandum the Military Members  definitely recommended a scheme ofcompulsory National Service which was laid  before  the War Committee by the  thenSecretary of State for War.    This the War  Committee approved  in  principle, on 30th November,  1916, andappointed a Committee  to work out  details and  place it on record that they attachedgreat  importance to the enactment of the necessary legislation  before Christmas, 1916.    7. This  Committee, under  the Chairmanship of  Mr. Montagu, prepared a  schemewhich was considered by the War Cabinet  on 14th December, 1916.  No decision wasarrived at in the absence of the Prime Minister  and  since then the proposal for com-pulsory National Service has been abandoned (see paragraph 14).    Before the Committee I pressed  that  the Department of the Controller of ManPower should take  over in whole or in  part the work  now  performed by existingGovernment Departments concerned with  the new work of the Controller, such as       (a.) The Reserved Occupations Committee.      (b.) Certain elements of the Labour Section of the Ministry of Munitions.      (c.) The  central machinery of the  Employment Department of the Board -of            Trade.      (d.) Certain elements of the Recruiting Department of the War Office.      (e.) Certain elements of the Home Office.(4614)
     Tins proposal was not given effect to when the National  Service  Department wasestablished.     8. The National Service Department was established on 21st  December, 1916, butwas formed de novo and not through the amalgamation of existing machinery dealingwith man power.     This  step, in  my  opinion, was fatal  to any  chance  of  success  that  the newdepartment might have had.     Instead of being a unifier of competing interests, as was originally hoped, it hasbecome merely another department  dipping into the pool of civil labour.  Not only so ;its creation without obvious duties frightened labour, and in my opinion helped to fomentindustrial unrest.   In result I believe that its existence has done much to complicate  analready difficult situation.     9. The first report of the Director-General of National Service embodied in Part I.an official statement forwarded to him by me through  the Director of Recruiting, whoat that time was nominally attached to both  the  War Office and  the  National ServiceDepartment.   This  was considered by the Cabinet on 19th  January, 1917, and  it wasdecided      (a.)  That 30,000 men engaged in agriculture should be made available for general           service by the end  of January; that this figure should not be exceeded           without fresh authority from the War  Cabinet.   It has  not  yet  been           attained.     (6.) That 20,000 miners should  be made available for general  service by the end of           January.   To 20th May about 8,500 miners have joined the Army.     (c.) That 50,000 semi-skilled and  unskilled munition  workers  should  be  made           available for general  service  by the end of January.   To 20th May under           this heading  and the next  sub-paragraph  the  Army has received  12,000           men.     In addition, the War Cabinet gave  the Director-General of National Service powerto release for the Army all men of the ages 18 to 22 holding exemptions issued by, orunder, the authority of a Government  Department, excluding men employed  in theproduction of steel,  in  occupations  covered by  the trade card scheme, in agriculture,mines and quarries, railway shops, transport work and shipyards.   It was also expresslystated that the men released under this decision were additional to those to be releasedto complete the quotas referred to above.     At their meeting on 5th February the  War Cabinet confirmed this decision, butlimited the  release  to  men  fit  for  general service.   To 25th May the number of menposted for military service as a result of this decision is negligible, e.g., the Admiraltyis still refusing to release young second  division clerks  affected by it.   Other Govern-ment departments have also refused to be bound by it.     10. In  addition, at their  meeting on  19th January, 1917, the  War Cabinetinstructed the President  of the Board of Trade to  consider measures for releasing afurther number of men from the railways.   As a result 10,000 men have been obtainedfor the Army; 12,000 were expected.     11. On the 5th February, 1917, the War Cabinet instructed  the  Home  Secretaryto prepare the draft of  a Bill  providing for the review by a new authority of  allTribunal exemptions (approximately 300.000) held by men  of  31 years of age andunder ; and the War Office to submit an estimate of the number of men who could  bemade available for military service if the Bill became law.     12. On 13th February, fthe War  Office submitted their estimate.  The  WarCabinet decided that the Bill was not to be proceeded with, and they instructed aCommittee, under Lord Rhondda, to confer as to desirable amendments of the MilitaryService Act, and instructions to Tribunals.     The Committee reported to the-War  Cabinet  on  1st March, 1917.   The  WarCabinet decided to  circulate the report to the Departments concerned, but took  nofurther action.     At the same meeting the  War Cabinet re-appointed Lord Rhondda s Committeewith additional members, to consider the general position as to the supply of men forthe Army ; the policy as to further legislation, and the modification of  existing methodsof exemption.     13. On 19th March, 1917, the Chief of  the Imperial General  Staff reported to theWar Cabinet the bad outlook in regard to  drafts, and he urged the  importance  ofpressing forward the amendments to the Military Service Acts  and other  measuresreferred by the War Cabinet to Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee.

The Ministry of Munitions desired it to be recorded that as the  result of this extended protectionthey might find it impossible to produce the quota which they were required to furnish.    f Names are now being received from Ministry of Munitions.  It is expected that on 1st June the menwill begin to report for service.    J The War Cabinet reduced the quota from 55,000 to 20,000 on the understanding that as many minersas possible would be transferred for iron stone mining and timber cutting.    5 See paragraph 10.  The order de-certificating men who  being of military age at 4th August, 1914,have entered the mines since the outbreak of war has been issued.  Men affected by that order are due tobegin to report for service immediately.  The order de-certificating men of the younger age groups who willbe necessary to complete the quota, appears to have been held up at the request of the Miners&apos; Federation.    II In addition to release formerly ordered.    if See paragraph 10.    ** Subject to the provision that the military authorities be entitled to claim additional men from thepolice force for military service to the  number of members of the Metropolitan Police Force, who werereleased from guarding naval and military establishments (2.700 members of the Metropolitan Police Forcewere now so employed).    tf It is understood from the Home Office that the release  of the full quota  will be completed shortly.Reports of posting  have not yet reached the War Office.     14.  On 23rd March, 1917, the War Cabinet considered the report of Lord Rhondda&apos;sCommittee, according  to which Lord Rhondda, Mr. Shackleton and the representativeson the Committee of the Admiralty, the Army Council and the Ministry of Munitions,considered the adoption of compulsion necessary for the provision of suitable substitutesin adequate numbers.    The  War Cabinet, however, decided  to  reverse the  previousdecision approving of industrial compulsion.     15. The War Cabinet further decided  on  the report  that  the Director-General ofNational Service should proceed with special appeals for  substitution  volunteers ;  thatthe  Trade Card Scheme  should be superseded  by  a schedule of occupations and agelimits; and that the schedule as circulated should be adopted.     The War Cabinet reserved other  matters arising out of the  Rhondda  report forfurther consideration.     16.  On  27th  March.  1917, the report of Lord Rhondda&apos;s  Committee was againbefore  the War  Cabinet.    The  draft  of the  amending  Military  Service Bill wasconsidered, and it was  decided that a single clause bill dealing with  medical re-exami-nation (Clause 3 of the draft Bill) should be introduced with  a view to its being  passedinto law  before  the Easter recess.   On  the  question of extending liability to militaryservice to resident aliens of allied countries it was reported that the Foreign Office hadbeen asked to  ascertain from the  Russian Government whether  they held the sameviews as  their predecessors on this subject.     17.  On 29th March, 1917,  the  War Cabinet gave Lord Milner and Mr. Hendersonfull authority to determine all  outstanding questions arising out of the report of LardIlhonddas Committee,  impressing on them that in any question affecting the constructionof ships or marine engines, their decision should be based on the principle that nationalwar interest demanded no reduction in  the output of the  yards.     These outstanding questions were  considered by the above-named two members ofthe War Cabinet on 29th March.     18.  Appendix A of the report of Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee which dealt with themethod of releasing men  from  the  protected  industries was thereafter adopted  by theCabinet subject to certain reservations.    As a  result  the quotas of men to be releasedby  Government Departments  during  the four months April  to July  as amendedwere: 
                                    Part II.    22. The number of men whom  the Army Council stated on 28th November, 191G(War Committee, 30th November, 1916), to be required to maintain the existing forcesin the field during 1917, was 800,000 men of Category &quot; A,&quot; and 140,000  of Categoriesother than &quot;A.&quot;  These were required as follows : 	&quot; A.&quot;	Other categories.January, 1917 February, 1917 March. 1917........ April, 1917.......... May, 1917.......... June,1317.......... July, 1917.......... August, 1917 ........ September, 1917 Total........	100.000 120,000 130,000 120,000 100,000 80,000 05,000 50,000 35,000	40,000 30,000 30.000 20,000 ld,000 10,000	800,000	140,000Recruiting to date has had the following results, viz. : 			&quot;A.&quot;	Other categories.January, 1917 February, 1917 March, 1917.......... April, 1917.......... May (to 28th) ........ Total.......	51,131 75,930 75,445 55,857 51,143	34,538 42,911 44,094 31,175 27,427	309,500	180,145     The deficiency in Category &quot; A &quot; at date, therefore, is 250,000.  The surplus on thedemand for men of other  categories  is 50,000, but in view of the great expansion oftransportation services overseas, an  expansion which was not foreseen in November,1916, the number  of lower category men obtained has barely been sufficient to meetrequirements.     19. To effect the release of the  quotas sanctioned by the War Cabinet elaboratemachinery had to be constructed by the Army Council  in order to place the recruitingorganization upon an occupational basis.  New offices were opened in all areas, in whichwere  concentrated the activities of the four officials [Le., representatives of the WarOffice, Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Labour, and the Department of NationalService) necessary under  the scheme to effect the release of men from munition works.In spite of the rapid creation of the new machinery, it is to be regretted, as will be seenfrom column 3 of the above table, that the effective release of men from munition workshas not in fact commenced.  It  will also be  seen from column  3 that as regards therelease of the quotas  from other groups, the Departments concerned have not in factsupplied to date any men, although a period  of two months has now elapsed since theWar Cabinet instructed the Departments concerned to take the necessary steps to  makemen available for military service to the numbers given.    20. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 15th May, 1917, the Secretary of Statefor War drew attention to the delay and stated that the numbers required would notbe available by the original date.    21. On 10th May, 1917, with the sanction of the Secretary of State for War, I decidedto recruit voluntarily men over military  age up to the age of 50 years.  On  12th Maythis was announced in  the Press.  On the  29th May  I was informed that the postersand further Press announcements required cannot  yet be issued.  Even this chanceof securing men  for the auxiliary  services and departmental corps is therefore  closedto me.
                                    Part III.     23. I am compelled to point out that  a regrettable inertness on  the part of theGovernment Departments  concerned has already created serious  inconvenience and islikely to produce a most dangerous situation if steps are not immediately taken by theDepartments who are responsible for the release of the quotas.     24. During the last four weeks  the psychological  basis upon which recruiting hasrested seems to have crumbled away.  At a time when war weariness was spreading inthe minds of the civil population, the need for men for the Army has been permitted todrop out of public view.     In parts of the country the belief now prevails that recruits for the Army are notneeded for military purposes but for purposes of industrial compulsion.   This belief hasbeen fostered by the  reliance of all Government  Departments upon the Army for menby  the  formation  of Agricultural Companies, Transport  Workers Units and  by theproposals of the Admiralty and Shipping  Controller to form Shipyard Workers Units.Attention is  drawn to the report on the Labour Situation (Section 5 &quot; Causes &quot;) renderedby the Ministry of Labour on 24th May, 1917.     25. Government  Departments and  officials  have sent written communications toTribunals stating that the need for men in  some  civil occupation was paramount, andin the opinion of the  Government more important  than securing men for  the Army.     26. Tribunals faced with  the  unpleasant  duty of sending men to  the Army arerelying on these letters to retain men in civil life.  They see Government Departmentsprotecting large numbers of young men in agriculture,  in  the  mines,  in shipyards, inmunition factories, on railways, &amp;c, and they perhaps, not unnaturally, believe that theneed for men is not acute so long as Government itself does this.     27. Further,  opposition is being stirred  up against  the  Administration of theMilitary Service (Review of Exceptions) Act, 1917.  Members of Parliament are takingpart in this agitation.     28. Opposition is also being stirred up against the Medical Boards on the groundsthat they are Military Boards.  In fact, they are civilian boards so far as compositionis concerned.  Certificates from civilian practitioners, many of whom have no knowledgeof the needs  of the Army or the work required of lower category men in  the Army, arebeing accepted by Tribunals as carrying greater weight than the  opinions of medicalpractitioners of at least equal competence who have patriotically placed their servicesat the disposal of the Government and are now serving on Medical Boards as civilians.Lay Tribunals are allowed to over-ride the opinions of qualified medical men.     29. In fact the whole position  has become impossible, and I submit that there isnow only one way of obtaining the men  required  to  fight this year, and that  is toinform the country clearly and plainly that the men have to be provided, and at  once,in order  to  tide over  the  period  of exhaustion which  will supervene in  the  earlyautumn.   (See Section 5, &quot; Remedies,&quot; of above-quoted report on  the Labour situation.)     30. To effect this I suggest      (1.) That the War Cabinet instruct  Government Departments immediately toproceed with all possible speed with the release of the quotas ordered to be released bytheir decisions of 19th January and 29th March.     (2.) That a Bill be immediately passed into law raising the military  age to  45 andcontaining power  to  extend  it subsequently  by Order in Council  to 50.   This isespecially required in order to release younger men for combatant duties  and  in orderto assist in meeting the many and varied demands upon the Army for labour.    (3.) A new statute to abolish  the  automatic extension  of exemption  of  twomonths enjoyed by certain classes of men.    (4.) A new statute to give power           (a.) To reconstitute Tribunals by the appointment, as chairman, of a Govern-                  ment official.          (b.) To amalgamate Tribunal areas.          (c.)  To provide for automatic transfer of applications in specified cases or                  classes of cases from Local to Appeal Tribunals.          (d.) To prohibit  more  than one  original application  to  a Tribunal for                  exemption.          (e.)  To prohibit Tribunals from dealing with late applications for exemption                 without the consent of the Army Council.
            (/) To provide that all certificates of exemption granted by Tribunals shall                  be final unless leave be given to apply for renewal.            (g.) To revise Tribunal  procedure  with a  view to  prevent unnecessary                  delays in decisions of cases.     (5.) A new statute  to limit the powers  of all  Government Departments  andTribunals with regard to the protection of men of 25 and under, with power by Order inCouncil to declare from time to time further age limits within which, or occupations inrespect of which, exemption foi military service shall not be granted-^     There are some 830,000 men of 25 years of age  and under still in  civil life, and itis difficult to believe that a considerable proportion of these, say two-thirds,  could  notbe spared from  their  civil occupations, of whom at  least  50  per cent, would be fit forGeneral Service.     31. The methods of recruiting which  have been forced  on me  by  the MilitaryService Acts and by the various decisions of the War Cabinet  under which I have  hadto work, appear to me to be bad.  I have urged on numerous occasions, as  shown above,that recruiting for the Army should be placed upon the simple basis that  I can expressin two words,  &quot; youngest first.&quot;     The present attempt is to take only men who can conveniently be  spared.  In myopinion such a policy is foredoomed to failure.  In the first  place, numerous  authoritiesmust decide who can be spared and who not.  This opens wide the doors to log-rollingand corruption.   In the  second place, uniformity  of decision  becomes impossible.  Asense of injustice is created, which soon comes to operate more  powerfully  in the mindsof the  men who have been left, but fear  they may be taken, than in  the minds  of themen who have gone.     To-day we have  much apparent  injustice.    Young men remain  in  munitionfactories, in agriculture, on the railways.   Older men are being taken  from the samebench or from the same station yards.  Probably  they are released because  they arefractionally less efficient, but they never believe that.  They blame some foreman, someyardmaster, some employer, the Government.     It is obvious that men must be left in munition  works, but not necessarily oil themen that are there now.   So long as the  selection of the men to go is left  to  thejudgment of an  individual, however capable, the sense of unfair  discrimination  willcontinue.   In  my opinion  the system upon which  releases are to be  effected must beclearly enunciated so that the whole country may understand it, and  further, once thesystem is announced it must be absolutely adhered to.  In illustration of what is meantI suggest that  if it was  decided to call  up men  of certain age blocks as from a fixeddate, the  present uncertainty and heartburning would diminish, inasmuch as under thepresent system, freedom to consider  individual  cases leads to  charges of  corruption,favouritism and injustice.    32. A  close study of the whole  question of Man-Power convinces, me that thereis no need to  despair  that the country is unable to keep its Armies in the Field up toadequate  strength, and also to maintain&apos;&apos;its essential civil activities.   The necessarymen exist, but unless  drastic changes are introduced  into the present methods I greatlyfear  that  labour trouble will  be  fostered, the manufacture of war necessities delayed,and  the recruiting of  men who  can and  should be  made  available for  the  Armyeffectually  paralysed.   The popular cry that the  Army contains a reserve of strength -in physically fit men  serving in Departmental Corps has to-day little or no-^BBtfdation,as I am satisfied  that  the unremitting  &quot; combing-out&quot; that has  been carried on formany months is approaching a limit beyond  which loss of efficiency will result.  At thepresent time the  sick and wounded  who  have  returned  from  the front  are beingsystematically  cured and returned to their units at a rate  which would  have beenconsidered  impossible during the earlier stages of the war, and which to many people isdeemed to border on inhumanity.  Unless fresh recruits are  forthcoming there are nomeans  other than those described above  by which even a  proportion, and a constantlydiminishing proportion, of the losses in the theatres of war can  be made good.C.F.N.M.,       A.G.
