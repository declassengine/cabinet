77rE--eign Secret.   My telegram dated 25th May          Fmm Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreiqn&apos;Department,                            mh May 1917.                      (Repeated to Resident, Aden.)                                                Jacob who has seen alltelegrams regards scheme as unsound. He is not satisfied that it is primarilyanti-Turk, and from some of names given he suspects it is engineered byIdrisi in order to get rid of Iman and  establish  his  own claims in Yemen.He doubts its success and if it fails considers that our best potential friendsin Yemen will  be  estranged  and our repuration for good faith  destroyed.He thinks some of Arab supporters are men of straw, and observes  thatwe cannot control confederacy.  He considers wisest policy  is to leave anArab rival to Idrisi.   Does Resident wish  to modify  his  views in  light of above ?   Force isgiven to JacobV last remark by information in  Residents telegram 365 of21st instant regarding Idrisi&apos;s relations with Italians whose influence  mightpredominate in Yemen if he were sole power there.
