SECRET      960                                         copy 1,0                         WAR CABINET   238-  *9    ATTITUDE OP CERTAIN STEAMSHIP COMPANIES IN REGARD TO           COMPLIANCE Off ADMIRALTY INSTRUCTIONS.                            I.Letter from Secretary to Admiralty to Secretary,  War Cabinet(Confidential)M.05299      The Secretary of the Admiralty presents his complimmtato the Secretary of the War Cabinet, and begs to transmit here-with, for the information of the War Cabinet, copy of a letterreceived from the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, dated 9thApril, together with a Memorandum to War Risks Associations andOwners of British Merchant Vessels,  which has been issued inconsequence.ADMIRALTY,      6th June, 1917                           II.Letter from Naval Commander-in-Chief,  East Indies and Egypt,                      to the Admiralty.CONFIDENTIAL433/1163                                     9th April,  1917Sir,      Be pleased to draw the attention of the Lords  Commissionersof the Admiralty to the fact that the attitude of certain Steam-ship Companies is such as may tend to discourage Masters  fromoarrying out tho instructions given them by the Naval Authorities.      2.  The following case of the S.S. &quot;HELLENES&quot;  - T.R.Houston&amp; Co. - which left Alexandria on 29th March for Gibraltar andHull, is cited as an example.      The Master complained that he found himself in  a very diffi-oult position, as the orders from the Naval Authorities direothim to zigzag and to steer a course which adds considerably tothe distance  he has to travel,  Ails those from his Owners dis-oourage such precautions as being bound to increase  his expen-diture of coal.      3.  As reduction of coal expenditure is incompatible withzigzagging and dispersion,  I wou^d submit that Messrs.Houston &amp;  Co.be directed to adopt a more reasonable attitude,  observing thattheir ships are covered by Government insurance.      4.  I would add that the above is by no means  an isolatedcase, but it is very difficult to quote specific  instances, asMasters are naturally reticent about discussing matters whichare likely to get them into trouble.    They prefer to receivetheir orders and to deliberate&amp;y negleot them when they are beyondimmediate Uaval supervision.
Confidentialgot for Publication   MEMORANDUM TO WAS  BISKS  AS.30C TAT IONS AND OWNERS Off BRITISH       In my Memorandum  of  19th February,  1917,  concerning Admiralty Instructions to the British Mercantile Marine,  emphasis was  laid in paragrap3is 7 to 9  on the necessity for zig-z&amp;gging being  carried out whenever ordered, and  to voyages  being protracted if and when necessary in order to adhere closely  to  instructions issued  as  to times ships should reach points of greatest danger.       2.  In a letter of the 20th March,  1916,  addressed to  the War Risks Associations,  the Managers  were asked to draw the  atten- tion of the members of  their respective  associations to the necessity for all British  merchant ships being  supplied with sufficient bunkor coal  to  meet  all such  contingencies as might arise,  and to allow a  margin  for ships  zig-zagging.       3.  Notwithstanding  this,  cases have come to the knowledge of the Admir^lby in which  masters have stated that their vessels had not sufficient ccal to proceed at their best speed in the danger area,  and for  this  reason the  order to zig-zag could  not be complied with.       4.  AD is well known to  all owners,  the position, since my letter of 20th March. 1916,  referred  to above, and oven since the more recent memorandum of  19th February, 1917, has undergone a most  material change.    The area of submarine activity has been greatly extended and  a  very much larger  number  of submarines are operating on the Trade  routes.   It has  therefore been necessary,,to issue orders that  &quot;ships of  all speeds  are to  zig-zag day and night,  and proceed at utmost spood when  north cf  latitudo 300 H.&quot;and east of longitude 200  W., and when in the Mediterranean.&quot;       5.  This will materially  increase  coal expenditure, and owners  are therefore relied upon to take  such stops as will ensure  their ships having  sufficient  coal  on board of good quality unfailingly to  carry out these instructions, and to allow their masters considerable latitude  in the  expenditure entailed thereby.       6.  With the qualities of coal  frequently supplied, the maintenance of the  best speed  of whicn  the vessel is capable is impossible *   Instances  are continually  occurring in which the speed of vessels has been  reduced V  at  least one-third owing to inferior coal and  tc  the foal stabe of boiler  tubes.       5.  The Captain of a P.  &amp; 0.  recently stated that  it wasquite exceptional to see a merchant  ship zigzagging-when  out  ofsight of tho Patrol craft.   Analysis of casualties in theMediterranean confirms this.      The P. &amp; 0. Company are a notable  exception to tho  above,and generally do all in their power  to make  the work of tho NavalAuthorities easier.                                        I am,  otc.                                         (Signed)   R.U.Wcmyss.                                                Vic  Admiral                                                OcirmaStor - fn-Chi ef.
      7.  In tho revised edition of  &quot;.7ar Instructions  for British Merchant Ships&quot; now In course of preparation masters will be enjoined to ease dov?n and sweep tubes before entering the submarine area and to have a supply of hand-picked coal acc-umu- latea on the stokehold plates for use in case a submarine is sighted.   It will materially tend to the safety of vessels if owners would at once instruct their masters in this  sense when their ships are in Home waters, and    ensure that before leaving the United Kingdom a sufficient quantity of the best coal procurable is placed in convenient bunkers for use in the danger area both out and home in order that ships shall be able to maintain their bejpjt^jspjo^ when most essential for them to do so.                              &quot; (Sgd.)
