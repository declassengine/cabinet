5%. COMPENSATION TO COAL OWNERS           for the   CONTROL 0? THIIR MINIS,          ^Titb.  reference  to  the Minute  2 of  the  far Cabinet     of the 5th April,  the Controller  of Coal Mines reports     that he has now concluded his  negotiations with a  special     Committee of the Mining  Association on the draft Heads cf     Agreement regarding compensation  for control.          The following are the chief  points  in the draft     Agreement:-(l)            Coalowners  to  retain 5  per cent of their profits          in excess  of  their  pre-war profits  (as  compared witji          the 20 per cent  retained  by  other industries). No          percentage standard to be allowed,  as under the Fin-          ance Acts.(2)            Compensation to be the  amount  of pre-war profits          reduced by three-quarters of the reduction of the output          where output  is  not reduced  by more than 30 per cent.(3)            Below the 30 per cent level the scale of compen-          sat ion to  cease  to  operate,  and the amount of compen-          sat ion per ton to be reduced where  the  fall of output          is not due to action by the  Controller.(4)            Cost  of  maintaining  in  repair  mines closed by          order of the  Controller and  of reopening them after          control to be met by an additional  tonnage.levy on the          industry,  the Controller  contlbuting *0 per  cent of          the sum required but only so far as any surplus accru-          ing to him after payment  of  the compensation  and          administration expenses will allow.          The quest ion of the Agreement  has been  considered at     a meeting of the Controllers  Advisory Board.
          The Owners * side of the Board stated that  they looked    upon the Agreement as being very drastic and severe on the    owners as compared with any otiier controlled industry and    they believe the Agreement to be a favourable one to the    Government.          The Miners1 side of the Board expressed the view that    it was the Government1 s own affair what Agreement was made    with  the Coal Owners.   They did not wish to be Regarded    as taJdng^any-rresponsibillty for the Agreement.  Their con-    tent ion is that no Agreement can withhold from  them the    right to present a demand for increased wages to meet the    increased cost of living, whether the ascertained values    of Coal justify such a course or the reverse.          If the above terms are approved by the War Cabinet    it remains to be determined what steps should be taken to    give  effect to the arrangement and the following alterns-    tive  methods are submitted for the consideration of the    War  Cabinet          (l)       Proceed by Bill to which the Agreement              would be scheduledo          (2)       Obtain the formal assent of the Mining              Association and make the Agreement binding              on all owners by a Defence of the Realm              Regulation.          In the latter event the question arises at what stage    the  Agreement-should be communicated to the House of    Commons.   Should the draft be circulated as a White    Paper, so that it can be discussed before it is finally    settled, or should the Agreement be first concluded with    the  Mining Associ^tloiL^and thereafter Announced to the    House?                                              &apos; A.H.S.June,11917.  &apos;
