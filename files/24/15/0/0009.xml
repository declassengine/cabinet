SECRETG.T.909                WAR CABINET.                  &quot;FORTH AND&apos; CLYDE SHIP C/irAL.   (Copy of letter from Secretary, Admiralty,  to Secretary, War    Cabinet).    K. 60782                                  5l8t M^ 1917 *Sir,    I have  laid before  My Lords Commissioners of the Admiraltyyour letter of the  28th August 1916,  No.  637, enclosing corres-poraence received from  the Secretary of the ReconstructionCommittee and the Mid-Scotland Ship Canal National Association,with regard to the  proposed construction of a Forth and ClydeShip Canal.   Their Lordships have also received from Messrs.Armstrong,  Whitworth &amp;  Company a project, with plans and esti-mates, for  such a Canal.   These will be forwarded to the WarCabinet if they have not already been received by them.     - 2.   It is understood that it is desired to learn theAdmiralty views as  to how far the experience of the War has mo&amp;i-fied the previous conclusions on the utility of such a Canal,and the project ht.s been examined chiefly from this point ofview.      5.   A Ship Canal between the Forth and Clyde would havebeen of very great  value during the present war.  It would haveenabled Vessels based on Rosyth and bound to and from T,7esternports for docking,  refit. &amp;c., to avoid some of the dangers of thepassage.   Cn the 28th October 1915, the &quot;Argyll&quot; was wreckedon the Bell Rock while  on passage from Liverpool to Rosyth, andon the 6th January 1916, the &quot;King Fdward VII&quot; was: sunk by a mineoff Cape Wrath while on passage from Rosyth to Devonport.  Theopening of Rosyth Dockyard in March 1916 has reduced the frequencywith which vessels  stationed at that port have to visit westernports, but H.M.A.S. &quot;Australia&quot;, H.U.S.  &quot;Princess Royal&quot;,H.M.A.S. &quot;Melbourne&quot;, H.M.S. &quot;fearless and &quot;Carolina&quot; have all beenobliged to do so.   The importance of a Canal after a Fleet actionto ensure the safe  passage of vessels docking at Liverpool,Glasgow and Belfast, night in certain circumstances be very great.It is considered also  that we have been fortunate in not losingheavy gun mountings and machinery which have had to be transferredfrom the Tyne to the Clyde by sea and vice versa.     -i.   A Canal would reduce the heavy strain on Railway rollingstock which is at present caused by the supply of coal.  The coalconsumed in the Firth of Forth, averaging about 85,000 tons monthlyis practically all rail-borne.  It is taken by rail to Grangemouthand there loaded into colliers.  With a Canal between the Forthand the Clyde the present wastage of large numbers of loadedlaiiway trucks, nececsarily kept in the Grangemouth sidings, wouldhi Siiated:1  Th! supply of coal from the South Wales ports couldIt/tl7 ea8J1y and *ore conveniently carried by sea to the Clydeand  thence by Canal to Rosyth than by the present arrangement.
(3gd)   W.  GRA.u-.aM GREEN.      5.  During 1916,  ?,50,00C tons of oil fuel were receivedfrom Rcsyth from overseas,  47 oilerebeing employed in conveyingtv-ii amount.  These oilers &quot;have had to follow routes round theBritish Isles on which  they were liable to attack both bysubmarine and by mine.   They require escort,  thus divertingPatrol Vessels from ether duties..  Since cilers are a specialclass cf vessel they cannot  be improvised and consequentlytheir losses are relatively mere sericus than those of othermerchant vessels of the same displacement.      6.  Besides being of value for men-cf-war,  the Canalwould also have been of great importance in reducing thedistance in dangerous waters traversed by merchant vessels toor from -the East Coast  ports as far South as the Humber.      7.  It is considered that the construction of the Canalis a matter of strategic importance for the future.  Its mainuse should be strategic and it should be under Admiraltyjurisdiction.      8.  It does not appear that the scheme can ever be self-supporting.  Its commercial value,  however, would be by nomeans negligible and it would probably yield a return on asubstantial part of the cost of construction.      9.  Their Lordships see no reason to modify the previousconclusion that the route through Loch Lomond and Loch Longis the only one which satisfies naval requirements.      10. As regards the engineering details of the schemesubmitted by Messrs Armstrong, considerable study and investi-,gat ion would be necessary before a technical criticism couldbe offered, and it is only possible to refer hers to certainof the main features of the scheme, as follows:-      (a) The cost, as  estimated by Messrs Armstrong, is 33,500,000, but this is  on the assumption that the workwould be done at rates  which were current a year before warbroke out.  It is very  doubtful whether this assumption isjustified, and on this  ground only (possibly on others also),the estimate appears inadequate.      (b) It i&apos;3&apos; not considered that it v/ould be economicalto adopt Messrs Armstrong1s suggestion that the work shouldbe done on the basis of ascertained cost plus percentage,safeguarded by - a bonus  to the Contractor if he executes theWork under its agreed cost.   In the experience cf the Admiraltythis method is costly and it would appear preferable that thework should be cut up into numerous sections and let as ascries of firm contracts.      (c) The suggested reclamation cf foreshores in the upperreaches of the Perth would require very careful considerationfrom the point of view  of its effect on.the sccur which servesto maintain the depth of water in the Channel in the lowerrsach.es.      11. Messrs Armstrong are anxious to proceed with thedetailed  survey ana preparation of a final definite project,wmch they say will take about a year to complete.  My Lordsassume, however, that until the whole policy has been decidedby the Government, no definite authorisation can be given toMessrs Armstrong cr any other firm or Association.
