G.2.938                WAR  OABIgEg.ARR/LHGSMSIIT 3 FOE THE EVEHTUAIi&apos; PMNote by the Secretary of tho War Ccbinct.             It  is  desired to  point out  to  the War Cabinet that there  still  remain a number  of  details  to  bo settled in connection with tho British representation at the  eventual peace conforence. It is  by no  means  impossible  that,  whether serious overtures for peace  are  opened in si:: months  or in si:: years, they may bo precipitated with  great suddenness.  Some event, or group of events, may  compel the  warring  nations,  with comparatively few  pourparlers, to moot in conference.   Should this occur the Gcvern- ment might find itself  confronted with  many questions requiring immediate  decision.   It appears desirable therefore that at least the more mechanical arrangements should be thought out beforehand and preparations made for giving effect to thorn automatically, so that Ministers1  minds may bo  free to concentrate upon tho many questions  of high  policy,  which may arise, the decisions upon which must dopond  upon circumstances  of .tho moment, which cannot at present be foreseen.             Up  to  tho present the main  work accomplished in proper a- tion for tho  eventual peace  conference  has boon to block in on vc-iy broad  lines  tho poacc desiderata of tho British Empire, rather as a standard to  be  aimed at than  as a practical policy.   Che question of sacrifice..-? which may have-  to bo na&amp;o in the process of bargaining has not boon very  seriously  discus sod end  possibly it would bo premature  to  faco  it at present.   1?evertholess tho matter should not be lost  sight  of.    Judging by their usual attitude at intornation- al conferences  the  Go mans at tho pcaco conferonco will so ok to obtain tho initiative  in   negotiation  by presenting a draft treaty or series of treaties  to  tho  assembled  nations .   It might&apos; bo an advantage to forestall  them  in  this  by presenting our own proposals in tho form of a draft treaty  at an early otago of  tho conference.             Apart  from  tho work of tho  Imperial War Cabinet itself, its Sub-Committees  and  the various inter-dopartmontal Committees that procedod thorn,  tho most  important  verm of preparation is being carried out  by  tho  Special Iirtolligcncc  Division under Commaiidcr Cozens-Hardy, R.H.V.R.  which  Is preparing  a series of handbooks of information  on  subjects likely  to bo of  value to our delegates.  In addition some special maps known as tho  3tatoman&quot;s Atlas - showing distribution cf population by nationality, JUmiguago,  religion, history &amp;c.  as  well as  mineral  resources,  agriculture, forests, oosmunioations  and  other details,  wore  prepared by tho spoeial Intelligence  Division by authority of tho  late Government, and a complete diary  end index of tho war,  giving tho date  of every important  event, with references to authorities,  is being compiled in tho Historical  Section of tho v/ar Cabinet Office by disabled officers.**           The preparations, howovcr,  for which authority is -ought in  this  note,  are in rather a different order,  and rolato^to the composition,  avid organisation of  the British delegation*mnd the arrange mo nts for housing and transporting the same.
          It would be of advantage if the War Cabinet  couldnominate the Government representatives,  who might  then  under-take general supervision of the advance arrangements.  Failingthis it is proposed to proceed on the assumption that  at  leastfour Ministers will attend the Conference,          The first pcint for which authority is sought  is toinvite the Departments concerned to select  at once  the Depart-mental officers and specialists whom they propose should  accom-pany the Governments representatives.   These officers will atonce have their minds directed to the problems with which theyare likely to be confronted and will be in a position  to  con-sider the preparations to be made.   When the representativeshave been selected, it would be desirable for them  to  meet inorder to confer cn various questions cf detail.  At firstsight the Departments concerned would appear to be:-          The Treasury          The Foreign Office (including an International                                                 Lawyer)          The Naval Staff, Admiralty          The General Staff, War Office          The Board of Trade          The Colonial Office (including representation                               of the Dominions)          The India Office          The Prime Minister&apos;s Secretar.i.atbut very possib3.y there are other offices...  such as  the Ministryof Munitions, the Ministry of Shipping and  the Ministry  ofLabour, which ought also to send experts  for special aspects ofthe Peace Confercncejor to be ready to send them when  required.          As the staff will almost necessarily be a large one,it is suggested that there should be a Central Secretariat.This could be organised, if desired,  by the Secretary  of theWar Cabinet in concert with the Prime Minister&apos;s Secretariat.the Foreign Office and other Departments.  It should comprisea properly equipped registry, the necessary forms,  card  indexfiles, etc. being prepared beforehand, and the many secretdocuments being selected in advance;   stenographers;   a  cipher-ing section;  a copying branch,  including several clerksaccustomed to typewrite in French with the proper machines;interpreters and traaslacors;  a reference library  to  be  care-fully selected beforehand;  a map and chart section;   astationery department and a staff of messengers.   All thedetails of an up-to-date office should be worked out andadvance arrangements should be made in regard to safes andpacking.   The establishment of a. service of messengers toand from London should also be considered.          As soon as the above arrangements have been  workedout the question of accommodation should be considered.Discreet enquiries should be made, preferably in consultationwith seme officer from the Embassy or Legation,  as  to  theaccommodation existing in each of the principal neutralCapitals where the Peace Conference might be held,  e.g. TheHague, Berne, Copenhagen, Stockholm,  Christiania and Madrid,The Ambassador or Minister should be warned to be ready atthe shortest notice to engage the hotels  and offices selected,and an advance Agent should be ready to proceed thither atonce in order to allot the necessary accommodation.
          Sush is a general sketch of the arrangements for theorganisation cf which authority is sought.   The decision.which it is suggested should he given by tho War Cabinet, issomewhat to the following effect:-          The Secretary of the War Cabinet (or such other         -authority as the War Cabinet may prefer to designate          eg., the Permanent U*S,  for Foreign Affairs) is          directed,  in consultation with the other lepart-         ments principally concerned; to prepare: for the          consideration of the War Cabinet a list of the lepart-         mental representatives and experts, to accompany the         British delegation to the eventual pence Conference;          and, so far as&apos;may be found practicable; to organise          in advance..,  in concert with the other Departments          concerned;  the secretarial and office arrangements,         maps,  library and accommodation likely to bo required.         The scheme  should be drawn up in ouch a form that it         may be applied at short  notice,  and should bo hept         up to dato  from the time of its completion until the         time comes  to put it in operation.(Signed)    Li -PA.HAMQ5Y-.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.  5th Juno,  1917.
