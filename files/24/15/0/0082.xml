1148.     The following information v/as given me this morningby Assistant Minister of War:-     Kerenski returned from his visit to the front convincedthat an offensive will be possible, but that a little intervalis still required to get rid of the evil effect of influenceswhich were brought to bear, after the revolution, on the mindsof the uneducated soldiers.  Now that Brusilov had been appointedC. in C he would decide when an offensive could be made.     A very good impression was conveyed by the report, whichKerenski made yesterday on his visit to front, to the Council ofWorkmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies.  After visiting northern front,he goes to Moscow, and then returns to Petrograd.     The Government has decided to take strong measures withKronstadt.  Tseretelli and Chernov have gone there to-day, notas members of the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies, butas members of the Government, to present an ultimatum to theeffect that Kronstadt will be cut off from Russia, and suppliedwith nothing, if it persists in its present politics.  (I failmyself to see how this threat is to be carried into effect,especially as I was informed yesterday that Kronstadt hadsufficient supplies to last till September).     On his return from South RtisSia,  Shingarev reported that7-g- million poods of flour had already been collected at stationson the railway, and it might easily be removed, but for weaknessof transport arrangements.                                      Assistant/
     Assistant Minister of War said that the bestindications of improvement in the general situation, werethat the attack on Petrograd by Kronstadt,  and the recentlythreatened massacre of officers, had neither come off,  and thatso far there were no signs of the general strike which  was dueto-day.  His views were optimistic,  but we  are by no means pastthe crisis of the situation,  and disturbances may follow theultimatum to Kronstadt.
