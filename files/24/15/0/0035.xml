Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.158BP/6.                     MEMORMDUH.       A Polish Army as a Separate Russian  Unit*                   (4th June,  1917.)     The political problem which has  assumed the  greatestprominence among the Poles in  Russia  is the question  offorming the Polish soldiers now serving with the  Russian armyinto a Polish national army, but  outside Poland,     The Polish Conservatives  for obvious reasons urge  that  thisshould be done; they also wish that the separate  Polish-RussianBrigade Y/hich they had formed  in  the  early  months of  the warshould be made the nucleus of  that army.     The Polish Radicals in Russia, on the other hand  point  outthat Polish commanders, the language  of command,  national uni-forms and flags, etc. v/ould not be sufficient to  make such  agroupment of Polish soldiers into a national army.    An armyis national only when subject  to  -the  authority and remainingunder the direction of a national government.  But such a  govern-ment, argue the Radicals, cannot  be formed by the Poles settledin the interior of Russia before  the  war, by refugees or bymen who happen to be serving with the Russian army.  TheRadicals seem prepared to accept  tho  idea of gathering  thePolish soldiers who have been  hitherto deliberately scatteredthroughout different Russian and Siberian regiments into specialPolish regiments, but not into a Polish army, because they  do notadmit the carrying on of a Polish policy outside  the  Kingdom ofPoland and independently from that developed in the centres  ofPolish nationo.1 life; such a policy might come into direct  oonflict
with that which may he agreed upon &quot;by the Pole* in Y/oreav/ and     In the Polish papers published in Russia and received by usthere is so far nothing to indicate the attitude of. the newrevolutionary Russian government to the question of the Polisharmy.   M. Gutchkoff seems to have favoured it, if one may judgeby an order \vhich he had issued concerning the Polish nationalflags.   It seems, however, doubtful whether the new governmentcan or will accede to the demands of the Polish Conservatives.After all, this is merely a political question and would hardlyaffect in any way the number of men fighting with the RussianArmy.   The political friends of the present Russian Governmentare the Polish Radicals and these . should the polish Army beformed, would certainly keep aloof from it.    Its direction couldnot therefore but paes into the hands of the Polish Conservatives,i.e., the men who had formerly been closely connected with theRussian ancien regime; between then and the present Russiangovernment there never has been and never can be any sympathyor alliance.   It is alleged that there are 500,000 Polish soldiersin the Russian army.   With suoh a force at  their disposal thePolish Conservatives might under conceivable circumstances becomethe centre of a counter-revolution in favour of moderate Con-servative elements in Russia.LM.
