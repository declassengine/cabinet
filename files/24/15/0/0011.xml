Du.                                 31st May, 1917Sir,      I am directed by the Shipping Controller to requestycu to take the earliest opportunity of  submitting to the V/arCabinet the enclosed copy of correspondence which has passedbetween the Local Government Board, the  Army Council and himselfupon the subject of the recruiting of experienced men fromshipping offices.    Sir Joseph Maclay cannot aoquiesce in thedepletion of the shipowners&apos;  staffs which is now threatened,and even actually in progress, at the risk of the breakdownof the shipping organization, and while  he does not ask forspecial consideration for men under,  say, 30 years of a^e andin a good medical  category,  he submits that the War Cabinetshould issue directions in respect of men over that a^e whoare engaged on  work of the nature indicated in the enclosureto his letter of the 13th instant to  the Local GovernmentBoard, whioh would ensure their  adequate protection^                             I  am, etc                                  (Sgd.)  GRAEME THOMSON                            II.        Ministry of Shipping to Looal Government Board                                              10th May, 1917T.A. 28692/17 Du.Sir,      I am directed by the  Shipping Controller to acquaintyou for the information of  the President of the Local GovernmentBoard that he has  received  numerous ropresjntutions fromshipowners that the services of their ships are toeing seriouslyimpaired by the refusal of  Tribunals to arant exemption frommilitary service to the necessary expert members of theirmanagement staffs, notwithstanding the notice in warabraoh 4Ox your circular R.95 of the 6th July, 1916.      After careful investigation and in the  light of recentgeneral experience the Controller feels that  these represonta-tions^are well founded and  he  views the trend of the Tribunal&apos;sdecisions in this  class of  case with brave anxiety. ...  .Jn ^hese circumstances he desires to ur0e the  Presidentwith the least possible- delay to draw the attention of the
Tribunals to the special considerations which now apply toBritish shiouing owing to the requisitioning of all linertonnage by the Government, and to the gradual extension ofGovernment control over tramp tonnage..      Under the conditions of requisitioning the Shipownersretain the management of the ships subject to Governmentcontrol of the services or trades in which the vessels aretc engage.   All surplus profits go to the Government whichpays hire for the chips at fixed rates.      Shipowners&apos; stuffs may, therefore, now be regarded asworking, directly for the Government and it is not the Ship-owner but the Empire at large which will suffer if the manage-ment of the ships is impaired by recruiting      Sir Joseph Maelay is led to four that owin0 to theelimination of the incentive of business success which Govorn-ment control inevitably entails, Shipowners 6onerally, ifthey fail to receive sympathetic considuration from theTribunals, may not trouble to press their applications forthe exemption cf the necessary experienced men.   TheController.,  therefore,  depends upon the Tribunals to see thatthe ends which Government control of tennage aims at are notdefeated by the withdiawal cf such men for Military Service.      In view of recent developments the Controller considersthis matter to be one of the greatest urgency.

It is desirable thereforeonat in any further communication which is  male bo tribunalsthe classes of indispensable men which the  Shippin0 Controllerconsiders should be retained in their civil employment shouldt)3 specified as clearly.as possible.

PROPOSED CIRCULAR MEMO  0 MILITARY SERVICE TRI^ilALS                      SHIPOWNERS 1 STAMPS      Lord Rhondda has been requested by the Shipping Controllerto state that many shipowners from all  parts of the countryhave brought to his notice particulars  of men with essentialshipping experience whoso exemption is  under revision, or hasalready been withdrawn, with the result that the - services ofships are being impaired.      The Shipping Controller accordingly desires that thepresent exceptional position of the shippinc industry shouldbo made clear to Tribunals.    All the Ocean Steamship Lines,and a lar6e and increasin0 number of the tramp vessels, havenow been requisitioned by the Government.   Under tho conditionsof requisitioning the Shipov.nors retain the mana0ement of theships sublet to Government control of  the services and tradesin Uaich they engage *   All  surplus profits go to the Govorn-mont which pays hire for the ships at fixed rates.-   In thosecircumstances, the Shipping  Controller  is led to fear thatowing to the elimination of the incentive of business successwhich Government control entails, Shipowners may not troubleto press applications for the exemption of indispensablemen if they  fail to receive sympathetic consideration fromthe Tribunals, the r:sult being- &quot;delay in prompt turn roundof ships and a consequent diminution in the tonna0e availablefor the country1s vital needs.                         .  .      Lord Rhonddci is of opinion that all businesses necessaryfor the -working of merchant shipping- may be regarded as ofhi^h national importance, and that Tribunals are justified inexempting from Military Service managers, clerks,  or otheremployees responsible for vork requiring experience andtechnical knowledge of the shipping industry, such as marinesuperintendents work,, the engagement and payment of crews,Custom House work, the ordering of shies&apos; stores,  chartering,insurance, and preparation of bills of  ladin0.    In smallerbusinesses some of these duties can, of coiirse, be combinedin the hands of one man.   On the other hand, the eliminationof competition, and the fact of Government control will nodoubt enable staff economies to be effected.

I am to state that in theopinion of -the Army Council the issue of such a circular toTribunals at the present  time would have a  very seriousand far-reaching effect on recruiting at a moment when themaintenance of the supply ox men for the Army is of theutmost importance.                            .1 am, etc,(Sgd,)       - -  -                   V,      Mtni8trT-o  Shipsia^ to War nffico.                                              18th     ,1^1 vA, 20692/17  -                                            ...Sir, .                   ;      I am directed by the. &quot;Shipping Controller to  transmither--&apos;.-ith for thC&apos;intormatjon of the ..rmy Council copy  ofcorrespondence which has .    passed oetween the Ministry  ofShio :-in0 and- the Local Government Board relative to thequestion of the exemption of shipowners1 staffs from militaryservice.
