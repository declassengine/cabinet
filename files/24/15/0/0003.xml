Progress has been delayedowing to the non-delivery of material especially in theClyde district.    There has been some improvement in thedeliveries of  material on the North Sast Coast but on thewhole there  is not sufficient material to meet the demands.The total amount  of wages paid during the past week amountedto  263,281, of which  93,516 or 3C$, was paid on merchantwork.   Eight  Munitions certificates were issued,  making thetotal number of standard ships certified 132,  and the totalnumber ordered 148.     Purchase  of Ships Abroad.

          The following extracts from two letters received fromMr. Sparks of the Cunard Steamship Company,  New York,  throughwhom all the tonnage purchased  by His Majesty1 s Government inthe United States of America has been negotiated, are  ofinterest:-          Extract from letter dated  10th May,  1917:-     C   You will realise  that all your arrangements  in     regard to managing ownership may be upset  by subsequent     legislation of  the  Government here, should it be  found     necessary to place  the vessels under the American flag.     However,  we need not meet  this trouble  half way,  and 1     only  call it to your attention as something you must     consider  in case of adverse legislation.          My own feeling is  that if we take  a very strong     stand the American  Government will see  the justice of     our position and allow  us  to take out boats and put our     flag  on them, whatever  they may do about boats building     here  for  Neutrals,  but  I am afraid the  feeling at the     Embassy in Washington  is rather that  it is inevitable     that  we shall have  to submit  to  put all these  boats under     the American flag.          The  latest  plan of the Shipping Board is  to  scrap     our contracts altogether,  except for those boats  that     are actually on  the  stocks,  their theory being that under     Government  airection the yards  can produce more tonnage     this  year and next  than trie builders acting by themselves     have  been willing to assume.    If.they produce a  practice!     and definite progiamme  to  accomplish this  I  have  no doubt     you would not ob3ect to  the scrapping of your  later con-     tracts, but  I have taken the  position that  the Minister     of Shipping would strongly  ob]ect  to having his contracts     scrapped  first and the Shipping1  Board&apos;s plan produced     afterwards.   The months that nave  been wasted  over  the     wooden  ship  plan  do not encourage  one to think that     immediate progress would be made  by the Board  over  steel     ships in  excess of what the builders feel  they can  turn     out.    The  inducement of high prices was already  there  to     encourage them to produce as much as possible,  and  if  the     Government are to give  the builders extra labour  they will     have  to co-ordinate not only with  the builders, but also     with  the  producers of steel, so  that they will have     additional work to go on with, all  of which will doubtless     come  about  in time, but perhaps after most of  our boats     are well  under way.          The  position appears to me  to be very simple.     Government co-operation if properly applied should  enable     us  to get our contracts out according to contract  dates,     or  earlier.  If  they can do this the regular ship  yards     using regular ship steel will be able to produce rather     more  vessels than have at present been contracted  for.     Beyond  this  if the Government intend to utilize building     steel and other material not up to Lloyds  test, and to     put on  to this work the army or steel workers who  have     been  employed on  the erection of steel buildings,  bridges,                                                        etc.,
etc., this should be done as a distinct and separateproposition from the orders which have already beenplaced with the established ship yards, and shouldnot be allowed to interfere with the programme forthe prompt delivery of vessels already contracted for.     I have expressed these views in many quarters andtrust that this will finally be the line of countrythat is taken.Extracts from letter dated 18th May 1917:-                Legislation.     This  is  too large a subiect to deal with  in ageneral letter and the situation shifts so from dayto day that written advices are of little value.Mr. Denman. the Chairman of the Shipping Board, hasEroved most troublesome and the Members of the ritish Commission who are here have found it  almostimpossible to make progress with him.  Meantime,however, no adverse legislation has been put throughand I still feel that with proper firmness on  ourpart there should be no difficulty in having thesteamers we have bought, not only left to us, but put&quot;Junder our Flag.     You will have seen that the Senate FinanceCommittee approved an appropriation of some $750,000,900to be spent for new merchant tonnage and if this ispassed by Congress an attempt will undoubtedly be madeto take possession of our boats, these being about theonly actual tonnage in sight.  The Shipping Board havetalked, principally in the newspapers, for threemonths about their fleet of wooden ships but they havenot yet even approved a design, and the reports thatthey have ordered steel ships are not confirmed, andthe Company mentioned has not yet its yard built.     There is a very general belief that the ship-building programme will eventually be placed in thesole charge of General Goethals, thus eliminatingMr. Denraan from this  particular branch of the shippingprogramme.   the latter!s plan was  to &quot;scrap&quot; allour contracts and begin again,  the  theory being that.with Government power he could  cause to be built three\times the number of ships that  we had been able toorder for delivery in a given space of time,  but thetruth of the matter is that he  is anxious to  have the-credit for having ordered the ships that your fore-sight has already made possible. As it is likely thatGeneral Goethals will handle this business I  havethought it desirable  to convey  our  views to him lesthe should also have absorbed Mr. Denma^s idea  thatit is better to tear  up one million tons and  replaceit with three, than to facilitate the  completion ofthose one million tons and  concentrate on finding waysand means of getting  the other  two  millions built.0
     I notico in the paper to-day an announcementcabled from Norway that the sale of further buildingcontracts has been prohibited by the NorwegianGovernment.   If this is correct it closes thatsource of supply and there are quite a number ofthese Norwegian new buildings that we did not succeedin getting.     I am now waiting your decision as to whether youv/ant me to proceed to pick up, if possible, some ofthe contracts owned by Americans as outlined in yourcable No.162;  The British Commission having expresseda favourable view on further purchases of this nature.                    Publicity.     During this past week the exact figures of ouroperations have been given to the public by Mr.Denman.With the approval of the British Commission I gavehim the figures in his capacity as a United StatesGovernment Official, and we did not suppose for amoment that he would rush them into the public press.Every shipbuilder, broker and doubtless every enemyhas been trying hard to find out the extent of ourprogramme, without success, and it is really too badthat Mr&apos;. Denman should have abused our confidence inthis way.   However, as you say in your letter,  itwas bound to leak out sooner or later, and there we are.               I am,                    Sir,                Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   John Anderson.
