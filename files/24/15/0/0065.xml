ailways/263.              WAR CABINET *Supply of locomotives for the various war areas.Mcmorandutmjby the Secretary of State for War.          I  should he glad if the War Cabinet  would take  intotheir early  consideration the subjoined memorandum by theDirector General of Movements and Railways.June,  1917,DERBY.     1.        An urgent need has arisen for the provision of     additional main line Locomotives for the various Theatres  of     War.A.        Tha West ern Front:              We have actually undertaken to provide 709 main line     engines;  but a very grave crisis in locomotive power has     occurred on the French Railways, and the Director-General of     Transportation in Prance has represented that if we wish to     assure  British traffic in Prance, we must supply 910.  The     number  actually ordered at present is 5(39, leaving a balance     of  341  to be found.B.        The Mediterranean L. of C.              The reduced  demand for main line locomotives for     this line is 113.C        Bfiypt:              84 locomotives are required for the purposes of     the coming  campaign,     2.        Allowing  for small,  but very urgent demands from     Salonika and Mesopotamia, we are faced with an immediate need     for not less than  560  locomotives.     3.        This  demand  cannot be met by making use of the     Belgian locomotives at Rouen,  since they are earmarked as an     indispensable reserve  of additional  locomotives required* or     the purposes  of the advanoe across Belgium and if they were to     be brought  into use it would be necessary to replace them at     once.    We  are  counting on  650 of these main line locomotives     being  allotted  to  us to conrplete our total requirements of     1,560  to the  Geiman Frontier.     4.        It was hoped that the United States might ultimately     afford us  some  relief, but the American Military Transportation     experts now visiting Europe inform us that considerable     difficulty  may  arise owing to  the size of the American locomotives     and the difference in  their couplings, so that it is clear that     we are not  justified in counting on assistance from this quarter.     We must therefore  make our arrangements for supplying at least     560 main line locomotives ourselves.
5,        The Ministry of Munitions  inform us that it isimpossible to place orders for new engines with any  expectationwhatever of early deliveries.    It follows,  therefore,  that inorder to obtain early delivery of  the  locomotives we require, theonly source to which we can look is  the  existing stock  of theBritish Railways,  who have already rendered us inaterialassistance in locomotives,  wagons  and  permanent way.    The RailwayExecutive Committee state that they  can  hold out no  hope ofproviding the locomotives we require except by the express orderof the War Cabinet.   What they have done  already, has  been donewith difficulty;   for while on the one hand they are carrying atraffic far greater than anything  in their past history, theyhave on the other hand been unable to  obtain the necessary amountof steel and copper to maintain or renew their engines  at anythinglike a normal rate.   An unusually high  percentage is under orawaiting repair,  and locomotives are being kept in traffic whichitt normal years would be sent  to the shops.6.        I THEREFORE PROPOSE THAT THE BRITISH RAILWAYS SHOULD BEGUARANTEED THE NECESSARY MATERIAL  FOR  REPAIRS AND RENEWALS in1917, AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE ORDERED  IN RETURN TO SUPPLY US WITHAN ADDITIONAL 600 LOCOMOTIVES BEFORE THE END OF THE  YEAR OP WHICHAT LEAST 200 SHOULD BE SUPPLIED BY THE END OP JULY.7.        She material necessary is  as follows :-Reboilering  Repairs      Renewals     Total  tons.        tons.        tons.       Vtons.Steel       8,710     51,628       12,245        72,583Copper      2,744      6,203          665         9,612Brass          41      1,762           &amp;0         1,853Iron          573     28,829      &apos; 1,008        30,4108.         While the entire provision of Locomotives is urgent,any further delay in meeting the needs of Egypt will renderit  impossible to maintain the proposed force in that theatreof  operations.(Sgd.)  W.  Guy  Granet,               D.G.M.R.6.6,17.
