                 Operations.G.Q.G.,  RussiaTo :-  C.I.G.S.1073.      This morning I had  a private  talk with Captain Bubnoff ofthe Russian Navy who is about  to take Russine&apos;s  place (?)  asChief of Staff of the Navy here. He is a personal friend  ofKerenski&apos;s and was without (sic) him during recent visit to S.W.front.  Captain Bubnoff assures  me  that Kerenski is heart  andsoul in favour of offensive  and  has together with Brusiloffdecided upon all measures necessary for attack.   The date  atwhich this attack will take  place is not yet known, it is  hopetiit will be in about 2 or  3 weeks, but that depends on progressin preparing troops for attack when the definite command isgiven them.  Kerenski, accompanied  by a number of good speakersfrom his own party, will  go  to the  S.W. front before the attack.He will address the troops and will do all that  is possible toarouse their enthusiasm,   Kerenski  is confident  that they  willrespond.  Several units have already given him (? group omitted)of obedience.  Captain Bubnoff is quite confident that Kerenskiis a thorough patriot but that for  fear of inciting too activepropaganda against him which might  lead him to resign, a stepthat would be disastrous  to  Russia, he cannot at present useforce for the purpose of  restoring  discipline.   A successfuloffensive however would at once  enable him to take (1 groupundecipherable) measures  necessary  to complete the re-establish-ment of order and discipline.    On  the necessity of driving theGermans out of the country he  continues to address the peopleand the troops.   In the  ease  of one regiment, which had notbehaved well on the front he refused to receive deputation ofwelcome from them saying  that  he would have nothing to do  withtraitors;  both in this way and  by  the constant pressure hebrings to bear for offensive,  Kerenski is rising (? risking)popularity in influential quarters, but he appears to beassured that the Council  of Workmen and Soldiers will not  open-ly oppose him although the LENINISTS are bitterly attacking him.Captain Bubnoff informs me that  Brusiloff. and Kerenski aresatisfied with amount of  supplies and munitions now collectedon S.W. front and that as regards artillery the situation  isalso satisfactory.   He  further  tells me tliat the reason forAlexieff&apos;s removal was partly  because he is still credited amongbulk of the army with being member  of old regime.   It v/as con-sidered that the appointment of  Brusiloff who is much more pop-ular than Alexieff with the troops  will have greater effect inregard to their preparation for  offensive.   Brusiloff isexpected to-morrow and in order  to  find out his intentions in &apos;all  theatres, I shall endeavour  -to  have the earliest possibleinterview with him.   I am informed that the post of chiefadviser on military matters to the  Government will be offeredto Alexieff but that it is doubtful if he will accept it.N.B.
