SECRETo      999TRANSPORT OF PORTUGUESE TROOPS TO FRANCE*   (Memorandum by the First Sea Lord.)The Secretary,    War Cabinet.          The question of continuing the transport of thePortuguese division has a^ain been considered, in consulta-tion with the -Shipping Controller1 s Department, in accordancewith the decision of the Vmr Cabinet.          The state of affairs as regards the transportswhich were used for the move is as follows          The &quot;Laomedon&quot;; &quot;Flavis,&quot;   and &quot;City of Benares&quot; havesailed for the United States to carry wheat to this country.          The &quot;Rhesus&quot; is due to leave on the 12th from SouthV/ales for Philadelphia,  The &quot;Bohemian&quot; has already beenallocated for the move of troops in the Mediterranean.          The &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Inventor&quot; are due to leaveBre3t to coal in this country before proceeding to theUnited otates for wheat.          The Director of Transports and Shipping states thatthe Viar Office have put forward a most urgent request for,extra transports to move 8,batteries of artillery fromMarseilles to Egypt.  Such a move would require 2 horsstransports; consequently if any of the ex-Portuguese shipsare utilised other than for wheat they should apparently besent to the Mediterranean to fulfil the&apos;War Office demands,which are more important than the movement of the Portuguesetroops.  If the ships required are taken from the transporta-tion of wheat to this country, it would mean that other shipsmust take their placesa          It is understood that the Cabinet desires a verylarge supply of wheat to &quot;be brought to this country, in July.The six ships which have been carrying the Portuguese troopsprobably represent about 50,OUJ tons of wheat a month, andare therefore a very important factor in this supply.          Another factor of the utmost importance in theshipping: situation is that of the supply of coal to Italyand to the French Fleet in &quot;the Mediterranean.  These areboth very urgent military necessities and any diversion ofshipping fiom wheat carrying to any other service but thesupply of coal to these countries is much to be deprecated.          Another point is the waste of tonnage involved&quot;inthe move of the Portuguese troops.   Owing to the dangerousroute which it is necessary for these ships to take theyhave to proceed during dark nights, consequently the trans-ports are lying idle for about&quot;50 per cent -of their time. -
       In view of the  above remarks,  it  is  considered  that  no British ships can possibly be spared to continue this move of Portuguese troops-,, and it is suggested that the difficulties should be -once more explained to the Portuguese Minister of War, and that he should be informed that it is deeply regretted .that It. is impossible to  find the ships and a suggestion made that their two transports, the &quot;Gileaneas&quot; and &quot;Pedro lunez&quot; should be employed on this work, and thus relieve our difficulties in the matter.       If the Portuguese would agree to this it v/ould be possible to send two Destroyers to escort  the ships between Lisbon and. Brest, and vice versa.     &apos; As regards the attached note from the Director of Military Operations enclosing a note from  Lord Robert Cecil, it is- considered that nothing can be hoped  for. from the Preach as regards further co-operation as  suggested.      The French demands on us for tonnage  are already. considerable and the &quot;proposal would mean still further demands on us which cannot be met.    &apos;  It is impossible to close this statement without .. referring to the terrible waste of tonnage space of which the Portuguese authorities have been guilty.      On May 20th the Transport Officer at Brest telegraphed as follows:-^      &quot;Transports 1 Rhesus1  (with 500 troops, 271 horses), 11  ^iaomedon&apos;  (with 290 troops  415 horses&quot;), and ^lavia&apos; &quot;  (with 880 troops,  no horses)  arrived.      Portuguese &quot;  ^ edro1.,  * $tines1  and &quot;Gilliannes1  arrived, empty. &quot;Considered great  waste of tonnape,  as ^lavia1  could have &quot;carried all horses,  stores  and half troops *  balance  of &quot;troopa coming in 1 Pedro  Nunez&apos;.    &quot;Flavia1 could  also  have &quot;brought all vehicles.&quot;\      The accommodation of these --hips was  as- follows:-                           Officers                           &amp; men.         Horses.       &quot;Laonedon&quot;      .&apos;   272            525 -       &quot;Plavia&quot;   ......   392            795       &quot;Rhesus&quot;   ......   4 36            382and one horse stall will accommodate four men.     This is only one instance of many similar cases vh ichhave occuired since the transport of the Division commenced.(Signed)   J.R.J^LIICOK.Admiralty., 8.,?.-  9tht June, 1917.
                       SI-XCLOSUKES...                         *-  I.      The Director of Military Operations presents his,cbmpli-ments to the Secretary :6f the Admiralty, and would he gladif the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty would consider .the practicability of the surest ion put forward by M.de Fleuriauand referred to in the accompanying communication.-    -  Since the matter is one of urgency, the Director ofMilitary Operations would be glad to&apos;receive a-reply as soon :as practicable.War Office,                                            , .   .8th June, 1917.-II.      The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presentshis compliments to -the Director of Military Intelligence andis directed by Lord R. Cecil to state that in course of con-versation at this Department on the 4th instant the FrenchCharge d&apos;Affaires- referred to the&apos; value of the Portuguesetroops new in France in view of the military necessity for moremen, and expressed the opinion that with judicious handling aconsiderable reinforcement might be obtained for the Allied-Armies from Portugal.      It was pointed out to Monsieur de Fleuriau that greatdifficulty lay in the question of providing transport andconvoy, a3 illustrated by the impossibility of actuallyshipping at present&apos; to France the few thousand&apos;troops whowere ready to sail from Portugal.  In reply to this objeo-tion, Monsieur de Fleuriau observed that there was notperhaps sufficient co-operation between the French andBritish naval and shipping control authorities, and he thoughtit quite likely that the French authorities could give someassistance-which would&apos; facilitate the problem of transport..      Lord R. Cecil realises that the-matter is primarily ofa military-nature., but woult be glad to receive Ma j or-General Sir G-. Mac do-no gh^s views on the question-generally.Foreign Office, .. 5th June,  1917.
