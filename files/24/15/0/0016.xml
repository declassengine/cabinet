Department of Information.                                                  FFW/Opi             SECTION F.    WEEKLY REPORT ON FRANCE.  I.             May 31,  1917.     The present situation in France is one in which the maininterest is rather social and industrial than political in thenarrov/er sense of that word.    The principal feature of theParliamentary situation  is.  on the surface, the easier relationsbetween the Cabinet and  the  Chambers caused by the more open anddeferential policy adopted towards Parliament by the presentGovernment.   This policy was of course a natural consequenceof the fact that the change  of Ministry arose out of the crisiscaused by the tendency of M.  BriamL&apos;s Ministry towards governmentby administrative decree and at the last moment out of General Ly-autey&apos;s undisguised impatience,  (only a part of which he was 8l-lowed to utter in his final  speech),  a;t the verbosity of theDeputies and at the inevitable waste of time involved in a systemwhich made Ministers live like perpetual -&quot;prisoners at the bar&quot;under a storm of interpellations.    But, underneath this surfacecalm; private reports indicate a contempt and dislike of the wholegroup of politicians now in  power  and not least of M.  Poincare&apos;himself,  which has been  steadily increasing for some time,    Therecent  changes in the military commands can scarcely be dissociat-ed from this situation.    It  is  a  sign of changing forces thatM. Painleve&apos; has undoubtedly  placed himself among the men likelyto count in future by taking  sides in the recent controversy withmilitary,  rather than with the prevailing political,  opinion.He now has Generals Pertain and FochVith him to direct  the Army,and a day may quite possibly come  when this alliance may bear
 further  fruits.   Sooner or later, at,  if  not  before,  demobili- zation,  many good judges think street disturbances  of  a serious sort not impossible.   If the Army chiefs  have then to save society,  to whom are they more likely to turn  for  the  political help they must have than to the man whose  support  gave them the victory  over the jealousy of his political colleagues?     These distant possibilities may never become  realities. But the  realities of to-day make it worth  while to  bear them in mind.   There seems no doubt that the industrial world of Paris is both openly and secretly in an unsettled  condition. The final capitulation of the Majority  Socialists  to the Min ority in the matter of the Stockholm Conference may or *may not be connected with the fact that the Trade  Unions are deolining in power, that no one knows who the real leaders of the workmen now are,  and that people like M. Caillaux  talk privately of their belief that associations of the nature of the Italian Carbonari are being formed.   At any rate  it is certain that there v/as a somewhat serious disturbance at the Bourse du Travail  on May 1st which v/as only checked  by a vigorous dis- play of  force, and that discontent at the  shortage  of  foodis general and is  at  the  present  moment  leading to  very wide-spread  strikes  which  have now  extended  to  a large number oftrades  including the  metal  trades  and  some  industries con-nected  with the war.     How far  this movement  may go  it  is, of course,  impossibleto say.    The  rumours,  only current among  the  lower classesand apparently without  foundation,  that  the Government  hasmassed  coloured troops  near Paris,  show  how far some peoplethink it  may go and perhaps  show  that the same  people doubtwnether  the French troops would support  the Government.The insistent  demands for food cards and regulation,  and themany signs of  impatience  with  the present apparent  inequality
\between  rich and  noor, are another  symptom which should not beneglected.   It is worth noticing that  discontent no longer takesthe old  form of indignation with Great  Britain for its supposedinsufficient military  co-ooeration  v/ith France.    That has dieddown or  disappeared.   The new unrest is connected with a dif-ferent set of grievances with which we  have little to do exceptso far as any assistance in helping the French Government toorganize more abundant supplies of  food and fuel is concerned.     The ultimately unanimous decision  of the Socialists toaccept the invitation  to Stockholm  seems to call for no remarkexcept that it seems to have been only  partly a mere surrenderof the Majority to the Minority with the object of avoiding de-feat.    It was this no doubt.   But it  v/as also genuinely influ-enced by the advice of M. Cachin who had just returned fromPetrograd and advised  his colleagues that the presence of FrenchSocialists was necessary in the interests of France, as only bymeeting  the Russian delegates can they  convince them that Frenchwar aims are democratic and that the&apos;German Socialists are,  infact, still agents of  the Imoerialistic policy of the Kaiser -Meanwhile the decision has caused much  indignation among otherpolitical sections in  Paris.
