(D.HS.355. 1.6.17.IBLOCK. A EE IKFOiil^VJI Pjj -25th to 31st Mgg 1917.IX,  BLOCKADE POLICY.     Suggestions aa to methods of cooperation in           a stricter blockade policy are now being submitted to           the united States.  i&apos;he general object is to curtail           very considerably the exports of native produce, res?           materials and manufactures from Holland and Scandinavia           to the Central Powers.  The lever which it is desired to            employ is the practical monopoly, which present circum-           stances have given to the United States, of certain           foodstuffs and fodderstuffs ^hioh are urgently required           by the four neutral countries in question.  The proposal           is that these countries should receive from the United           States only such rations of food and fodder as will           suffice for their bare necessities when utilised in           conjunction with home-grown supplies at present exported           to Germany and Austria.  If such exports cannot be           totally suspended, tha United states should not allow           the pre-war standard of export to be exceeded, and           should retaliate for any excessive export by an immediate           and equivalent decrease of the rational supplies.  It           is suggested that, as a preliminary step, and pending           the establishment of satisfactory rationing schedules the           United States should suspend all exports of good           and fodder to Scandinavia.  1&apos;hie policy will require           the closest cooperation, and would be most effectively           carried out if American delegates were sent to London           to participate in our control of the blockade.  It is           not merely the export of foodstuffs to Germany that we
                           -   -            should like to reduce,   he neutrals in question are            providing our enemiea Tvith military supplies.  Holland            and Denmark are providing horses;  Sweden provides            iron-ore, iron and steel, copper and pyrites, ehfc.nlaal            wood-pulp, ferro-alloys, machine tools, rosin and            carbide;  Norway provides nickel, molybdenum, refined            zinc, iron concentrates, copper and pyrites, ferro-            alloys.  !The policy of restriction will nave to be            warily applied since eacn of uhe  our countries is            supplying important native products or manufactures to            the Allies.   But if the united States agree to the            policy, it will he given a tried.  Incidentally it            would enable us to put further pressure upon the            mercantile marines of the four countries,  so as to en-            sure that none of their vessels lie idle and all are            economically employed.    STOgSB.       There is little room ior doubt that  the new            Swedish Ministry prefer to drop the arart  Anglo- v/edish            Agreement.  They hope that their reoent concessions            will suffice to obtain for Sweden the imports which are            required to safeguard her food-aupplien and keep her            factories open.  H.M. Government feel that Sweden has            not yet established a claim to special consideration,            and may usefully be left in suspense for a time till we            and the United 3tate3 have arranged a common polioy.                  !fhe economic position in Sweden becomes every            day more serious.  ^hcre have been several strikes ofID            navvies, dockers and bricklayers;  and the Central            -crude Union Organisation desires to arrange a general            strike for higher wages.  More factories are closing
        every day for want of raw MATERIALS.              The Swedish railways are now carrying between 3,000        and 4.000 tons a weefc of goods for Russia.  But the        traffic across the Gulf o^r Bothnia is suffering consider-        ably at the  hands of German raiders,  and may soon cease        altogether if the Russian i&amp;miralty take no steps to pro-        tect the vessels engaged in it,   Swedish sailings to        the United I in*dom are  still infrequent. and the Swedish        Government give  ovmera  no specif i?iduoe?nent to engage  in        this trade. I^OLVIV Pit *        The ^orwesian shipowner a  have  not yot come to terms        with us, though we have yielded  to th&amp;ir Jtmsnd for        higher  char taring-rates as regards their smaller vessels.        They ??ish to lav up their regular liners in the iiorth Sea        trade;   and  also to throw upon us the odiuci of compelling        the return of those Norwegian vessels which are engaged        in distant trade.    Shese proposals are inaoceptable, and        it is thought that drastic steps may  be necessary to make        the shipowners and the  Norwegian Government more aoooramo-        dating.[jETHEHLAjaDS.     l;he Luteh Government are expected to  ratify the        shipping agreement which was provisionally concluded in        London  by Mr,  Snouok.   Consequently Dutch  vessels (other        than mail-steamers)  will now be  allowed on certain terms        to call for  examination at  overseas ports.             It is  reported that  German  and  Austrian  interests        sre making special preparations  to  reopen  trade  with the        Butch East Indies at  the  conclusion of  peace.   They are        seeking to open  large credits in Holland,  and  propose to
                           - * -       use the 43 enemy vessels which are lying in Irtiteh East       Indian ports.  Schemes are also on foot for building and       acquiring shipyards in Holland, in which ships will be       built with German materials and for German account.S.7ITZEKLAJ3J).)  The federal Government consider that the French       Blaok 01 st of Swiss? traders has been compiled in       contravention of the S.S.S. -agreement, and beg that we       will not recognise it.  It would seem that the best way of       reconciling Swiss rights and interests with the exigen-       ciee of the blockade is  to Detain the cooperation of the       Swiss Government in framing an agreed Black List for       Switzerland.GHBBCE.      It is doubtful whether Venizelist Greece will be       able to secure an appreciable part of the 5?hessalian       harvest, end the harvests in Macedonia and the Islands       will be small.    he Islands have no  stocks of wheat re-       maining and the need for imported supplies is urgent and       immediate.UIIgJBD S&apos;i!AriBS,     5Jhe United  States Steel Go.  have  offered to       supply us  with iron ore  which will relieve us from our       present dependence upon  Spain for this  material.             It is estimated  that  the  maximum  amount  of tonnage       which the  United States  shipbuilding  yards  can turn out       in the next eighteen months is  three  million tons  dead-       weight.    This estimate  excludes  ships  already on  the       stocks and 161 wooden  vessels averaging 3,000  tons  dead-       weight.
             The United states have noted with concern an       efflux of gold from American Banks to Spain and Japan.       At present they have no legal power to prohibit gold       exports.             Theat valued at  27,000,000 is expected to be in       the market this month.SOUTH AMERICA.    ,   We have decided to take no more wheat from       the Argentine;   the ships which are already outward bound       to the Plate will load  with maize.             Brazil proposes to seize the enemy tonnage now       lying  in  her ports.  The ships will be towed to the       United States for repairs, and the American Government       will be left to decide  what use shall be made of the ships.GEBMAB SUBifojaiflE BLQCKAflS.
