                     1st m 7th June, 1917,                 318SWXEEjf,        5Pfte Swedish Government are seriously perturbed at          the growing scarcity of foodstuffs and raw materials.          The Potato stocks are almost exhausted:  within a few          weeks  the Food Commission will be unable to honour the          bread  and flour cards which it has issued.   By the end          of June  the cotton mills will be at a standstill, and          other  important industries are in  equal  jeopardy,  if,          Swartz and his colleagues have apparent Ly resigned them-          selves to accepting any terras which the  United States          may impose,   Under the circu stances H.M. Government          are disposed to allow temporary supplies  of the most          essential articles to reach Sweden, so that a crisis may          be averted;  but will only do so if the  export of these          articles and of their products is  absolutely prohibited.          We should thus, for example, deprive dermeny of the          supplies of meat, pork and fish which she still receives          from Swedish sources.   The exports of  iron ore from          Lulea  and Oxelusond so Germany would be  left untouched          by such  a compromise.   But, for the stoppage of the          ore traffic, it seems  that we mast rely  u^on the          economic pressure which the United States can exercise,          or u^on  the  direct intervention of the Kussia fleet,vIMARIC.          The Anglo-Danish agreement respecting agricultural          produce  is  in danger of collapse.    The Danish dairy-          farmers  are  dissatisfied with the  low prices which they          obtain for  their butter in tho United Kingdom;  and          British  importers  find a difficulty in disposing of the          Danish bacon which is offered them, booauce the quantities
        are too larf?o.end the quality is inferior.    A Danish        delegate will shortly visit London $o put the ease for        a revised agreement.              H. M. Government are negotiating for a reduction        of the exports of Danish fish to Germany.   The limit       1 proposed is  ,000 tons a month.   The Danish Government        have offered to accept this proposal upon certain terms,        which include special facilities for the importation of        petroleum and fishing supplies,    t present the beat        qualities of fish are all  &quot;oin^ to Germany, anil there is        a continual dearth of fish in Denmark.   The fishermen        only place on the Danish market the  ininura amount        which is required by Is v..    So loner as they obtain their        petroleum from Germany they will be obliged to continue        this policy, and the Danish aovernment dare not restrict        the  fish trade any further.   The fishermen the,selves        expect that we shall warn them off the Horth Kea fishing        grounds;   and It has been su^ested that instead of        making an agree  ant we should put Danish fishing vessels        into the prise court, or extend our mine fields in order        to close the fishing groundn against them,NORWAY.       The Ilorwegian aluminiurr. factories hnve been in-        formed that they mast give priority to the orders of        their own Government and must create a stock of 500 tone        to be held at the Governments disposal;  otherwise the        export of aluminium will be prohibited and the factories        themselves may be expropriated.   This looks like on        attempt  to blackmail the Allies.   The British and French        Governments  are  prepared to see that the legitimate
needs of the Horwogian Government are sur - lied;   batthey are lodging a protest against the threatenedmethods of compulsion, which are the more unwarrantedsince the factories are financed by foreign capital.     The Norwegian Government have not made any adequateproposals for restricting the export of fieh to  Germany,Sir M. Findlay suggests that the United States ehouiainn let UPon the total cessation of this traffic, and thatwe should then ^enounce the existing Fish Agreement whichhas been costly to us end hne not prevented (Germany fromobtaining considerable ^ueplira,        Government howeverhave made proposals  (a) for the Partial purchase by theNorwegian Food Commission of the old free stocks  (b) toensure that in the future Oer ^ny shall not receive in anymonth more then 15 tons of fiuh for every 85 tone which we&quot;urchane.      The riorvegian Shin Owners have nor put forward aSo he me, which has the approval of their CJov-raraent, forthe chartering or requisitionirer of their vessels byH*).&quot;.. Government.   The scheme ofiers no assurance thatwe shall get the immediate use of the Norwegian vesselswhich are nov trading in distant waters.   The ownersv,ill be  compelled by the Norwo/rian Government to placethese ships in Sox*wetrian or Allied trades as the currentcharters expire.   But,  t they prefer the BorwentianAmerican trade, m are left without a remedy, except inso far as we can exercise indirect pressure by moans ofour  bunker control.      The Spanish Government have modified the draftCortina  Agreement  till  it is unrecognisable.   This is an
act of bad faith, since the draft was basea  on thenropoeale which the Marquis Cortina himself submittedto us,    The United States Government have  b^enasked to  elay, and if possible to prevent,  thedespatch of any cargoes of American coal to  Spain,until we have come to a definite understanding withthe Spanish Government.     H.*T. Government propose to lay before theFrench and United Stated )ov rnraents a scheme forthe joint purchase of Italian oranges and lemons inthe forthcoming season.   This appears to be the onlymeans by which these fruits can be diverted  from theGerman and Austrian markets.      The Enemy Trace Bill and the Export RestrictionsBill have been favourably received in Congress.  Underthe former every firm which trades in enemy territorywill automatically be declarer an enf*my, even thoughits headquarters are in neutral or United Statesterritory.    The Bill does not involve the publiea-tion of a Statutory Black List.   The Export Restric-tions Bill absolutely prohibits the export of certainarticles and provides that nothing may be exported toneutral European countries exoept under licence.  Itis anticipated that the licencing system will begradually extended to cover exports to non-Europoancountries.    The censorship provisions have beendeleted from the gxnort Eestrictions Bill.       For the present the Government are only prepared
to control American bunkers  so  far  as  to  secure  thatthey shall not be used by ships which  denire  toevade the British bunker-control.
