                                        Department of Information.                                                   FSW/001.           SECTION P.   WEEKLY REPORT OK SPA III. I.          June 1,  1917.     The outstanding feature of the present situation in Spain isthe increased definiteness of the division between the pro-Germanand the pro-Ally parties.   The unlimited submarine campaign in-jured the interests and insulted the pride of Spain, and Count Ro-manones was prepared to take active steps to vindicate both.The result was his fall from power v/hich is believed to have beenbrought about by the King himself in consequence of a proposal byRomanones to send an ultimatum to Germany.                               (Alhucemas)     The new Ministry with&quot;Garcia Prieto/&apos;as Prime Minister andAlba, who remains Finance Minister, as one of its more importantmembers, has shown its pro-German tendencies not only by its re-fusal to ratify the Cortina agreement, but by its prohibition ofan interventionist meeting at Valencia, by its acceptance ofGerman conditions for the return of Spanish ships blockaded inBritish ports and by refusal to grant leave for export of earlypotatoes.   The increased activity of German submarines in Spanishwaters may also not be unconnected with the fall of Romanones.     It is difficult to say how the parliamentary situation willdevelop if the Cortes is summoned.   Romanones is certainly host-ile to the Government and particularly to Alba,  and may cause itsdefeat, though he has issued a statement to the Press repudiatingany intention of doing so.   In that case Senior Dato and theConservatives might take office, possibly with Liberal support.The fact that the King has given a long audience to Besada, a
                              -2-former President of the Chamber, seems to suggest possibilities ofa crisis.   This possibility lends additional importance to theattitude taken up by Senor Dato and Senor Sanchez de Toca, perhapsthe most important official Conservative after Dato, towards thegreat speech delivered a month ago at Madrid by the ex-PremierSenor Maura, which aroused so much discussion both in Spain and inEurope generally.   That speech, in spite of its allusions to thenatural and cultural affinities which united Spain to the WesternNations, was in the main, like the greater part of the audienoewhich listened to it,  frankly pro-German.   Its references to navaldominiation being as objectionable as military and more universalin character, its assertion that Spain had received no offence fromGermany that justified a rupture, and above all its allusions tothe sore points of Gibraltar and Tangier were much more loudly  *cheered than the few pro-Ally sentences it contained,  and obviouslywere, and were intended to be, points scored against the AlliesVBut the speech skeins to have been chiefly an oratorical triumphand did not much please any one.   It was in fact a bid for office,but Maurafs relations  with the King are commonly believed not tobe good, and this,  if  there were no other reasons,  v/ould make hisreturn to power unlikely.   VJhat is important about his speech isthat it has helped to  define the situation.    Senor Dato at oncetook the oppottunity to point out that Maura only spoke for himselfand a small group and  in no way for the Conservative party of whichhe is not the leader.    He added that the policy of that party wasneutrality tempered by regard for the dignity of Spain,  and agree-ing with Maura that a  close understanding with Prance  and Englandwas a security for Spain, deprecated Maura&apos;s allusions to Gibraltarand Tangier.   Senor Sanchez de Toca went further,  denouncing thesubmarine campaign as  illegal,  arguing that  the right  course  to
take in reply to it was to refuse to continue to represent Germany&apos;sinterests in enemy countries, and generally adopting a strong pro-Ally tone.     It is tempting to assume that these utterances imply that ifthe Conservatives return to power they would follow a pro-Allypolicy;  but it will be remembered that Count Romanones, while outof office, wrote a much discussed article called *Fatal Neutrality&apos;but nevertheless as Prime Minister continued this 1 fatal&apos; policy.     Another way in which Maura!s speech has cleared the air is byleading directly to the counter-demonstration held,  as his was, inthe Bull Ring at Madrid by various sections of the political Leftlast Sunday (May 27th).   Vioient efforts had been made to preventit being held but the Government refused to interfere and it wasattended by some 20,000 persons.    The general tone adopted by thespeakers who inoluded Senor Lerroux,  the Radical leader, was thatcf hearty sympathy with the Allies and recognition that the war isone between absolutism and democracy.   A resolution was carrieddemanding a breach of diplomatic relations with Germany, and mostof the speakers declared that Spain&apos;s interests required that sheshould make common cause with the Entente.     Spain is probably too weak for any very serious considerationof intervention by a responsible Ministry.   But the feeling inits favour is at least sufficiently strong to have  caused theAnarchist party, probably under German influence,  to attack pro-Ally statesmen in their press and to  call meetings  of anarchistsand extreme labour elements denouncing the Interventionalists,including the Socialists who are  supposed to favour  war.    And  ofcourse the greater frankness of pro-Ally opinion leads  to corres-ponding energy in pro-German quarters.    The only new point whichapoears to arise is in connection with the rumour, which has been
officially contradicted,  that the Entente is negotiating for anaval base in the Canaries or Balearic Islands.    This is usedby the anti-Entente press to take up in their turn the complaintagainst Neutrality at all costs1 made by the pro-Entente pressin connection with the submarine outrages.    They declare thatany occupation of Spanish territory would immediately be resistedby force of arms.J.B.
