Includingchildren1s allowances have been awarded.supplementary pensions and special allowances were madeby the Statutory Committee against 129 in the previousweek and that the total number to date is 4100.with during the week was 3000, including 403 which had beenrejected under previous Warrants, as compared with 3,120during the previous week.  Of the 3000 cases 2067 weredisposed of by the grant of a pension, permanent orconditional, and 933 by the grant of a gratuity, while intwo cases the claims were rejected.   In the 403 formerlyrejected cases 35 pensions and 368 gratuities were awarded.In the 2,183 of these cases dealt with up to date, 393pensions and 1,790 gratuities have been granted.award shows an increase from 5001 to 5391 in the weekattributable to the occurrence of the -rrhitsun holiday andto the fact that the Section of the Ministry dealing withthe work was transferred on the 29th May from the permanentbuildings in the Duke of York&apos;s Headquarters to thetemporary hutments in the grounds,  causing an appreciablereduction in the week!o output.Table II shows that last week 119 grants of2.The number of fresh soldier pension claims dealtThe number c-f first claims from soldiers awaiting
3.       The work of awarding and authorising payment ofWidows and Dependants pensions in current cases iscompletely up to date.  Claims under the new Warrant foralternative pensions and training grants to soldiers1widows, for pensions to parents on the basis ^f prospectivedependence, and for pensions to mothers where the fathershave died during the war are now beginning to come in.        2,660 re-assessments of dependants pensions weremade during the week as against 2,983 last week.  Thereremain 61,266 cases to be dealt with.  (Appendix I).  Ofthis week&apos;s cases 904 have benefitted by the re-assessmentto the average extent of 3/11 a week; 1,756 receive nobenefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-wardependence.        The 618 cases of widows and dependants whichremain for settlement as to entitlement under the newWarrant are still hung, up o^ the question of a widerinterpretation of the -wording of the entitlementconditions that has hitherto been given to it.4.          The draft Royal Warrant for Army officersand nurses is now in its final stages.  Copies of thedraft and of an explanatory note are attached to thisReport as Appendices II and III.             The Government Actuary has reported on theproposals,  the cost of which he estimates at  1,295,000in 1917-18, rising to  1,700,000 in 1919-20.  Thecapitalised value of the combined annual charges he putsapproximately at  30,000,000.              It is hoped that the sanction of theTreasury will be received in a day or two and. that itiTill be possible to lay the Draft  arrant, with theexplanatory note and estimate by the Actuary,  on the-                                              table                                                              I                                                              u
table of the House very soon after Parliament re-assembles.          Progress is being made with draft Orders inCouncil for naval officers and nurses and for naval warrantofficers.  These will follow closely the proposed Warrantfor the Army and should be ready in a week or ten days.                        TrSAT;. riT5,         After some discussion the Treasury have agreedthat Institutional Treatment may be extended to men dis-char^ed for causes not attributable to military service,provided that the period of treatment is limited to theduration of the !var, and 12 months afterwards - a limitationwhich the Minister accepts as reasonable - and subject tocertain adjustments in regard to sanatoriur.i benefits, thedetails of which are being considered.                                                        46.          The Treasury have approved generally the pro-posals of the  inister in letter of the 20th April (appendedto Report of 21st April) for the liberal support of soldiersand sailors while under treatment and training, and of theirfamilies.            In the case of men sent for courses of treatmentand training the rules will in brief be as follows -     (l) The man1s pension will be made up to the rate fortotal disability;  against this 7/- a week only will becharged towards the cost of his maintenance.  This shouldleave a married man a substantial surplus to send to hisfamily after providing himself with pocket money.      (2) The family, Irrespective of anything which the manmay allow them out of his balance, will be given the sameallowances as widows and children.          In the case of lunatics in asylums an allowancefor special (non-pauper) treatment will be paid, and alsoa sraall sum of pocket money, if the man is in a condition                                                       to
to use it;  but any balance remaining will not be paid.as it is considered that the family are practically inthe same position as those bereaved, and that treatmentsuperior to that given to widows and their children couldscarcely be justified.          Correspondence is still proceeding with theTreasury as regards the cases of men sent to institutionspractically for the remainder of their lives ( such asParaplegics, incurable Consumptives and sufferers fromCancer).   In these cases the Minister considers that themen while chargeable for the full cost of their subsis-tence ( not for treatment r*r attendance) should be allowedto draw the balance, in view of their sad condition andof the fact that they are unlikely to survive for any longtime.7.          The settlement of the two matters referred toin the foregoing paragraphs and some others of minorimportance will enable arrangements for the medicaltreatment of discharged disabled men under Article 6 ofthe Royal Warrant and Order-in-Council to be completed,subject to the acquiescence of the medical profession tobe sought in conference next week.   In the meantime theminister has thought it necessary that a circular (Vppogidiiti3^ should be issued by the Statutory Committee instructingLocal Committees to pay the allowances authorised by theArticle referred to, pending the issue of the full in-structions under that Article.   Under the Regulations ofthe Statutory Coiinittee (ito. 12 of Part II) allowances onrather a lower scale than those provided for in the Warranthave for some time been payable in cases of treatment ortraining, but it was felt that the more liberal provisionsshould without further delay be applied to the disabledmen and their families,
8,   Impressed by a number of complaints that had reachedhim as to the presence of discharged disabled men inworkhouse infirmaries, the Minister of Pensions approachedthe Local Government Board in the matter as stated inparagraph 6 of the Report of the 28th April.  The Boardhave now issued a circular to Boards of Guardians inEngland and Y/aleg calling their attention to the provisionmade for the treatment of disabled men under Article 6 ofthe new Royal Warrant.   The circular instructs them tonotify the Local Pensions Committee of any case of a dis-charged disabled man in their institutions with a view tohis removal from the workhouse, and the provision of someappropriate assistance by the Local Committee.  The Scottishand Irish Offices have been approached by the Minister witha view to the issue of similar instructions to Poor LawAuthorities.in Scotland and Ireland. .At the same time theStatutory Committee have circularised all Local Committeesinforming them of the action taken by the Local GovernmentBoard and directing them to take immediate steps to dealwith the cases notified to them.   Copies of the twocirculars are annexed as Appendices V and VI, hereto. .    Two circulars dealing with discharged disabled menhave also been issued by the national Health InsuranceCommissions.    In the first (Appendix VII) ApprovedSocieties are informed of the arrangement made between theCommissioners and the Ministry (see paragraph 5 of Reportof March 30th) for recouping the cost of Sickness andDisablement Benefits paid to invalided soldiers and sailorsin consequence of disabilities due to war service.The Societies are instructed to keep a careful record forthe purpose of the recouping scheme with a view to accurateassessment  of the benefits paid.       The  second circular (Appendix VIII) explains theprovisions  of the National Insurance (Part I) Amendment                                                        Act
Act 1917j which has been referred to in various previousReports.10.       The Army Council have at the instance of theMinistry cf Pensions issued a further instruction(Appendix IX) on the subject of discharged soldiers asout-patients at.military hospitals, to apply the previousinstruction in this matter to all soldiers dischargedfrom the service on medical grounds, whether they aredischarged direct from the hospital or from a commanddeoot, or other unit.  The instruction also provides fordistinguishing for the benefit of Local War PensionsCommittees between (a) cases which require outpatienttreatment at a Military Orthopaedic Hospital, and (b)those which can be dealt with satisfactorily at a GenevaHospital, military or civil.11.       The Tenth Meeting of the Committee onInstitutional Treatment was held on the 31st May.  Thereport, attached as Appendix X hereto,  may be summarisedas follows: -     (1) Neurasthenia.  The use of a house near Manchesteroffered by i..&apos;r.  Leigh as a Neurasthenic Hospital forofficers was discussed and it was decided to point out to!&apos;.r. Leigh that such a hospital for Lancashire was morerequired for men.   Some financial matters connected with&quot;Highfield&quot; Golders Green,  were dealt with.     (2) Tuberculosis.  The scheme for  providing pavilionsto existing hospitals and sanatoria for advanced casesof tuberculosis was considered in further detail and itwas agreed that the Ministry should communicate with theLocal Government Board and with Joint Advisory Committeeswith regard to it.     (3) Paraplegia.   Dr.  Fox Symons  reported on thenumber of cases for which provision had to be made.Lonsdale House was  to be opened for 25  beds  on June  4th.                                                    A.
A hone was being provided in Last Lancashire.  TillerslioHouse, Nottingham, had recently been opened.    (4)  Facial Injuries.  I-oofs Cray Hospital for whichthe Red Cross Society has defrayed moot of the CapitalExpenditure will probably be talren over by that body, inwhich case the Ministry are prepared to make a per capitagrant for discharged men treated there.12.      The Health Section of the Disablement Committeeof the Statutory Committee held a mooting on the 25thMay,   Schemes for the medical treatment of discharged menhad been received from the Ilorwich, Swansea, Londonderry,Plymouth and West Bromwich Committees.   In each caso apart of the scheme has been approved while certain sugges-tions are b?.in  made to the Local Committees concerned withreference to the remainder.   Some questions of amounts andmethods of payment for treatment 7/ere discussed.13,        The Training and employment Section of theDisablement Sub-Conaiiitt.ee of the Statutory Committee meton the 1st June and progress made with regard to schemesfor Bristol, Gloucestershire (including Gloucester andCheltenham), Ilorwich, Berkshire, Portsmouth, Fifeshire,and ilorfolk was reported.   There was some discussion onthe subject of endeavouring to get the system pursued inLord Roberts&apos; Workshops modified so as to be of greaterpermanent benefit to the men employed there, and as to trionecessity of the ministry obtaining the fullest informationof all schemes started for assisting the disabled dis-charged soldier, with a view to giving these schemes asmuch guidance as they would accept,                   OKGAITIS^TIOII.14,        A statement of the proceedings&apos; of the StatutoryCommittee for the week ended the 30th May is annexed asAppendix XI.                                                      The
          The War Pensions Committees at Halifax andVJillesden and for Cambridge shire are, according to theStatutory Committee Inspectors, proceeding energeticallywith their work.  At the first named place Visitors wereappointed to the hospitals within a week of the Committee1scircular on the subject being received.   The NorfolkCommittee have stated they are unable to find voluntaryworkers for the purpose, and the Kent Committee want to paythem.            At Burnley there is difficulty in finding -employment for men unable to undertake heavy work.            At hexford and &quot;Jaterford Committees areeffectively at work,but no Disablements Sub Committeeshave in either case been formed.15,         A report is now available of the Conference,referred to in last week&apos;s report, which was held on liay25th at Nottingham, of the V/ar Pensions Committees of                     Derbyshire                     Nottinghamshire                     Lincolnshire                     Leicestershire  :                     Rutlandshire59 delegates from 14 Committees wore present and passed aresolution recommending all V-ar Pensions Committees withinthe above mentioned.

EXPLANATORY  NOTE  ON THE  FOREGOING  DRAFT OF                       A ROYAL WARRANT.    The draft warrant is based partly on  the  regulations already existing and partlyon the recent Royal Warrant for soldiers.    A  corresponding Order in Council  for the Navy has been drafted in  similarterms, except to the extent that the conditions of the Naval Service require differences.                          PART  I. DISABLED OFFICERS.    1.  Retired  pay is granted  under present regulations  to temporary (includingSpecial  Reserve and Territorial  Force)  officers  according to  the degree in whichearning capacity is affected, four degrees  being recognised.   Under the  proposedWarrant the retired  pay will  be assessed according  to  the  degree  of  physicalimpairment  on  a scale of tenths.  The rates for the  highest degree of  disablementare more favourable than the present rates in aU  ranks (e.g., 2501. instead of 225L fora lieutenant-colonel and  175 . instead of 150L for a subaltern).    Officers  holding permanent  commissions  in the  Regular Army  will  in futurereceive, in addition to what they are  entitled to for disability under the Pay Warrantof 1914, an allowance varying with the degree of their disablement.   This allowancemay also  be added  to  the pension which an  officer  has received  for service  inthe ranks.    The same pension is to be given in future whether  the disability was caused byservice or only aggravated  by it.   Hitherto, only the effects of the  aggravation havebeen taken into account.    Provision is made for an officer becoming disabled after the  war by service in thewar.    Temporary or acting rank is  to reckon in cases of disease no less than in cases ofwounds or injuries.    The present provisions as to officers in receipt of wound pensions and as to officerstotally blinded in action are retained.    2. In addition to retired pay, a disabled officer may be granted allowances for hischildren.  This  is a new grant.   For an  officer disabled  in the  highest degree theallowances will be 251. for the  first  child,  201. for the  second, 151. for the  third, and10Z. for the fourth and each subsequent child.  For officers  disabled in a lesser degreethe allowance will be proportionate to that degree.  The existing education allo wancesin cases of pecuniary need are  continued, but the minimum age is reduced from 13to 9, and the maximum  rate for girls raised from 251. to 351. a year.     3.  Where a disabled officer makes application and shows that his retired pay andchildren&apos;s allowances are such that, with his remaining earning capacity, he cannotattain to his  pre-war earnings, an alternative pension may be given to him to make upthe deficiency subject to  a maximum of 300Z. a  year,  plus  one-half  of any pre-warearnings between 300Z.  and 600L  a year.   This is a new provision.     4.  Retired pay at temporary  rates is to be given until an officer&apos;s disablement hasreached its final condition, but the permanent pension then awarded may not be alteredto his disadvantage.     5.  If an officer declines to  undergo treatment, certified  to be necessary in hisinterests, half the retired pay and childrens allowances may be withheld.     6.  An  officer certified  to  need  special medical  treatment  in  a sanatorium, hospital, &amp;c, may receive retired pay at the rate for  the highest  degree of  disable-ment.   The  actual necessary medical expenses of a  disabled officer may be paid upto  such an  amount and under such conditions  as  may be  determined.  An officer totally  disabled and requiring the constant attendance of a  second person may receive an allowance not exceeding 781. a year.     7.  A disabled officer undergoing necessary training  may receive retired pay at the highest rate, and an allowance may be made  in respect  of his fees.     8.  Where the degree  of disablement  is less  than 20 per cent., or in other cases where it is thought  more suitable, a gratuity may be granted, in no  case  exceedingU (33)3163-2 12 50  6/17  E &amp; S
EXPLANATORY NOTE ON  THE  FOREGOING  DRAFT  OF                       A  ROYAL  WARRANT.     The draft warrant is based partly on  the  regulations already existing and partly on the recent Royal Warrant for soldiers.     A  corresponding Order in Council  for the Navy has been drafted in similar terms, except to the extent that the conditions of the Naval Service require differences.                           PART  I. DISABLED  OFFICERS.     1.  Retired  pay is granted  under  present  regulations to temporary (including Special Reserve and Territorial  Force)  officers  according to the degree in which earning capacity is affected, four degrees  being recognised.   Under the proposed Warrant  the retired pay will  be assessed according  to the  degree  of  physical impairment  on  a scale of tenths.  The rates for the  highest degree  of  disablement are more favourable than the present rates in all ranks (e.g., 250L instead of  225L for a lieutenant-colonel and  1751. instead of 150L for a subaltern).     Officers holding permanent  commissions in the  Regular Army will  in future receive, in addition to what they are  entitled to for disability under the Pay Warrant of 1914, an allowance varying with the degree of their disablement.   This allowance may  also  be added  to  the  pension which an officer  has received for service  in the ranks.     The same pension is to  be given in future whether  the disability was caused by service or  only aggravated by it.  Hitherto, only the effects of the aggravation  have been taken into account.     Provision is made for an officer becoming disabled after the  war by service in the. war.     Temporary or acting rank is  to reckon in cases of disease  no less than in cases of wounds or injuries.     The present provisions as to officers in receipt of wound pensions and as to officers totally blinded in action are retained.     2. In addition to retired pay, a disabled officer may be granted allowances for his children.  This  is a new grant.  For an officer disabled in  the  highest degree the allowances will be 251. for the  first  child, 201.  for the second, 151. for the third, and 10Z. for the fourth and each subsequent child.   For officers disabled in a  lesser degree the allowance will be proportionate to that degree.   The existing education allowances in cases of pecuniary need are continued, but  the minimum age is  reduced from 13 to 9, and the maximum  rate for girls raised from 251. to 351. a year.      3. Where a disabled officer makes application and shows that  his retired pay and children&apos;s allowances  are such that, with his remaining earning capacity, he cannot attain to his pre-war earnings, an alternative  pension may be given to him to make up the  deficiency subject  to a  maximum of 3001. a  year,  plus  one-half  of any pre-war earnings between 300Z.  and 600L  a year.   This is a new provision.      4. Retired pay at temporary  rates is to be given until an officers disablement has reached its final condition, but the permanent pension then awarded may not be altered to his disadvantage.      5. If an officer declines to undergo treatment, certified  to be necessary in his interests, half the retired pay and children&apos;s allowances may be withheld.      C.  An  officer certified  to  need  special  medical  treatment in  a  sanatorium, hospital, &amp;c, may receive retired pay at the rate for  the  highest  degree of disable- ment.   The actual necessary medical  expenses of a  disabled officer may be paid up to such an amount and  under such  conditions  as may  be  determined.  An officer totally disabled and requiring the constant attendance of a second  person may receive an allowance not exceeding 78L a year.      7. A disabled  officer undergoing necessary training  may receive retired pay at the highest rate, and an allowance may be made in respect of his fees.      8. Where  the degree of  disablement  is less  than 20 per cent.,  or in other  cases where it is thought more suitable, a gratuity may be granted, in  no case exceeding  500Z.      U (33)3163-2 12 50  6/17 E &amp; S
2      9. Where an officer is invalided out of the Army for medical unfitness, which  is neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service, a gratuity may be granted him, which, in  exceptional circumstances, may be as much as 300L   Under present regulations, disabilities contracted before entering service, and not aggravated by it, are excluded, and the grant is limited to three months&apos; pay.                             PART H-RELATIVES.      10. The provision of the Pay Warrant, making the  pensions  of officers&apos; relatives a reward for the officers service and dependent on their own worthiness, is retained.      11 and  12.  The  existing scheme of  three  grades of widows&apos;  pensions,  the &quot; highest,&quot; the  &quot; intermediate,&quot; and the &quot;ordinary,&quot;  is retained, but the cases coming in the  several categories are re-grouped, with the result that certain  kinds of cases are raised to a higher grade.  Thus, where an  officer dies of illness due to fatigue, privation, or exposure incident to active  operations in the field, or from  injuries received  in the performance of military duty, his widow will in future receive the &quot;highest&quot; instead of the  &quot;intermediate&quot; rate;  and where death was aggravated by service or  caused  by injuries  attributable  to  service (not  coming within the above terms), she will receive  the  &quot; intermediate &quot;  instead of the &apos;; ordinary&quot;  rate  or  a gratuity in lieu of  the &quot; ordinary &quot; rate.     The existing rates of widows&apos; pensions  and children&apos;s allowances are considered sufficiently liberal, but the opportunity has been taken to grade the rates for  the different ranks of general officers.     The age for education allowances, granted in cases of pecuniary need, is reduced from 13 to 9, and the maximum grant for girls increased from 251.  to 351. a year.     Widows will receive gratuities in addition  to pension for  themselves and their children under the same terms as at present.     Invalid children are specially provided for as at present.     13. In circumstances similar  to  those  in which an alternative  pension  may be granted to a disabled officer one may be awarded to  the widow of a deceased officer equal to  half the  amount which would  have been granted  to  him  had he  lost all earning capacity.   The maximum  pension would be 225L     14. Where  the officer&apos;s death is not attributable to or aggravated by service, his widow may be granted  a gratuity of from one to three years&apos; pay if she is not eligible for the &quot; ordinary&quot; pension (granted by  the War Office^ owing to the shortness of  the officers service.  This is  an existing provision, except that cases of aggravation will in future be qualified for &quot; highest &quot; or &quot; intermediate &quot; pension.     15.  A  widow who  re-marries  may  have her  pension   restored  on  second widowhood ; but it is proposed to require in future that her pecuniary circumstances justify the restoration.     16. It is proposed, under proper safeguards that will prevent an abuse  of the indulgence, to allow  the  widow of a disabled officer who  has been in receipt of a disablement pension of not less than 701. a year  one-half of  his  pension.  This is a new provision.     17. Special  provision for motherless  children, which was omitted from the 1915 Warrant on the recommendation of the Select Committee, is re-introduced.     18. The regulations for the relatives, other than widow and children, of a deceased officer are considerably extended and relaxed, subject to certain general conditions.     19. The parents of an officer may  in future be granted a pension even though the father may  be living and not totally incapacitated, and even  though there was  no actual pre-War dependence.  Where such dependence existed, it will  be the primary basis of the pension,  hut the pension  may be  granted or may be  increased having regard to the infirmity, age, need, and other circumstances of the parents.     20. Where no pension can  be granted to the parents, a gratuity not exceeding one year&apos;s widow&apos;s pension may he given.     21. The conditions as to pensions for sisters are  also to be considerably relaxed, and young or invalid brothers are to be eligible.     22. Where  no pensions  can   be  given to  sisters  or  brothers, gratuities not exceeding half a year&apos;s widow&apos;s pension may be granted.    The other dependents of  officers  promoted from the ranks  during  the war mayhave any benefits they could have got if the officer had not been promoted.
                              Part IE NURSES.    The provisions for nurses follow generally those for officers, and are on a verymuch more liberal scale than the existing regulations.  Thus, a Staff Nurse  totallydisabled through war  service will receive 100L a year,  as compared  with 40Z.  atpresent: and there  are special  grants for  sanatorium or hospital  treatment,  fortraining, for medical expenses, and for constant attendance.    A nurse disabled  from tmfitness, not  attributable  to or aggravated by service,may receive a gratuity which in exceptional circumstances  may amount to 200Z.  Thepresent regulations allow only three months&apos; pay.

Whitehall, S.W. 1.                                              26th May,  1917.  DISCHARGED  DISABLED  SOLDIERS  AND  SAILORS              IN   POOR   LAW  INSTITUTIONS. Sir,   I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to draw the attention of the Board of Guardians to the  provisions of the new  Royal Warrant and  Order  in Council for the Pensions of Soldiers and Sailors disabled in consequence  of the present  war and to  the Regulations of the  Statutory Committee with regard to  the provision of medical treatment for such men.   Under the terms of the new Royal Warrant and Order in  Council, in  any  case where it is  certified by a Medical Board  or  Medical Officer  appointed for the  purpose that  a disabled man who is  in receipt  of  a  pension  under  the  Warrant or  Order in  Council should,  in  consequence of his  disablement, undergo  any  special course  of  medical  treatment  or be treated in or at a sanatorium, hospital, convalescent home, or other institution, and he is  deemed unable in consequence to provide for his own support and that of his family, an allowance in lieu of pension  of not less than 27s. Gd. a week, subject to a deduction for his maintenance if in an institution, may  be made to the man, and in  the case of a man whose treatment necessitates his living  away  from  home, his  wife will receive  an amount not less than  the pension  and  allowance for children to which  she would have  been entitled had  she been a widow.  Any charges, fees, or expenses,  in  respect of his  treatment that are not otherwise provided for will be paid by the Minister of Pensions.    At the same time the  Local War Pensions Committees, which have been established for  each county and county  borough and  for certain  other  areas,  have  been  charged with the  duty of making the  requisite arrangements for institutional treatment for  disabled men residing within their area.    In view of these provisions no discharged  disabled man should in future  be  under the necessity  of seeking poor  law relief in a workhouse or  infirmary  in any case where  the  incapacity from which  he is  suffering  is due  to his  disablement.   Lord  Rhondda will therefore be glad if the Board of Guardians will communicate at once with  the  Local  War Pensions  Committee of their area regarding any case of a  discharged  disabled  man in receipt of a pension at present in  any of the institutions under  their control. Any future applications from discharged men in similar circumstances should be referred at once to the  Local War Pensions Committee.    Lord Rhondda understands  that the Statutory Committee at  the instance of the Minister of Pensions are issuing a Circular to  the Local Pensions Committees instructing them to give special atten- tion to cases  so notified  by  Boards of Guardians with a view to the  necessary  and appropriate  assistance being rendered  without delay.(4896.)

  Arrangements are under consideration by which  discharged  menwho are not entitled to a pension may be provided with institutionaltreatment, and a further communication will  be addressed to youin the event of such arrangements being made.

I am to point out that a discharged disabled man should  be under no  necessity insuch circumstances to seek  poor law assistance, in view of the ample provision made formedical  treatment by  Regulation  12 (h)  of Part  11. of  the Regulations, and  morerecently by  Article  6 of the  new  Royal  Warrant and  of  the  Order   in  Councilrespectively.      The Instructions for the administration of the Royal Warrant and of the Orderin  Council will  very shortly  be  issued, but in  the meantime  Local  Committees arcfully able to deal with the cases referred to under the Regulations.      In  these circumstances  the  Local Government Board  are issuing a circular toBoards of Guardians in England and AVales  requesting them to communicate  at oncewith Local Committees regarding the case of  any discharged disabled man in receipt ofa pension,, who is at present in any institution under  their control, and  it is understoodthat similar Circulars will be issued by the  Local Government Boards for Scotland andIreland.       On receiving a communication from any of the Poor Law Authorities  with respectto any case  of the kind referred to, the Local Committee should take steps, as  early aspracticable, to secure the removal of the man to another Institution, or to provide suchother assistance as may be  appropriate.                                       I am, Sir,                                               Your obedient Servant,                                                       E.  A.

NATIONAL  HEALTH  INSURANCE.      Recoupment to Approved Societies of the Cost of Sickness and      Disablement Benefits Paid to Invalided Sailors and Soldiers for                      Disabilities due to War Service.     1. The Government have decided to relieve  Approved Societies of the burden imposed on their funds by the payment of sickness  and disablement benefits to sailors and soWiers discharged during the war  on account of wounds and illness, so far as it is estimated to be attributable to war service.     2. It is clearly impracticable for Societies to analyse all benefit payments to discharged men and distinguish those due to war service from those due to ordinary causes,  and it is therefore proposed to assess the proportion of the total payments to invalided men which is to be regarded as due to war service.     3. The assessment will be  made  after an   actuarial  investigation  into the sickness  claims of a large sample of discharged  men  of  all ages and occupations spread over all parts of the United Kingdom.   The assessment when  determined will be applied to all Societies.     4. The first assessment will apply to the period from the beginning of the war to 31st December, 1916 ; a fresh assessment will be made for  1917 and for each year thereafter until 31st December, 1920, when the whole position will be reviewed.     5. Every Society and Branch having members who were or who may hereafter be discharged from the  Navy or Army during the present war must make arrange- ments for recording separately in future the amounts  of  sickness and disablement benefit paid to invalided men discharged during the war in order to secure that the total amount paid and  the  amount of any overpayments recovered each year can be readily arrived at for the annual cash summary return.     6. A note  should be made  in the Membership Register against the  name of every member who has been a sailor or  soldier and has been discharged invalided during the  present war thus :                           Invalided from ^av^   Date.                                   J     Army    [Note. Care must be taken not to treat, as invalided, men who have been transferred to the reserve         on being released from military service for munition and other national work.]    7. As regards benefits paid on and after 1st January,  1917, where the Benefits Register  is  kept in the  official book form it will  probably be found convenient to record the  payments to invalided sailors and soldiers in  a separate section of the Register  and to make a  separate.entry of the total in the Summary of the Benefits Register.  If the  number of discharged sailors and soldiers is too small to justify the payments  being recorded in a  separate section of  the Register,  the words &quot; invalided  sailor  or soldier &quot; should be entered in red ink below the entry of the man&apos;s name in Column 3 of the Benefits Register; in the latter  case it  will benecessary at the  end of each half-year for the total  amount paid to  each suchmember, as shown by Columns 13 and 14 and Columns  17 and 18, to be extracted oh to a half-yearly schedule, which should be totalled, and the totals of these half-yearly schedules  should he separately  entered in the summary of the BenefitsRegister for the respective half-years.

2    Where the Benefits Register is kept in a card or loose leaf form it will probablybe found most convenient to record separately week by week the payments of sick-ness and disablement benefits to invalided sailors and soldiers, and to show the totalseparately in the weekly summary of benefit payments.              [Amounts paid before the adoption of the system of a separate entry in the weekly          summary will require to be  specially extracted.  The payments from 1st January, 1917,          to the date of commencing the separate weekly record should be at once earmarked and          in due course included in the half-yearly Summary of Benefits to June, 1917.]    8. Refunds of overpayments of sickness  and disablement  benefits  made  toinvalided sailors and soldiers since  discharge  should be distinguished from otherrefunds, and should be set against the gross payments of benefits to such membersin each half-year&apos;s Benefit Summary.  ,    9. The  total amounts  of sickness and  disablement  benefits paid  to and theamounts of over-payment recovered from invalided sailors and soldiers by a Societyor Branch in the year 1917, and subsequent years, will be entered by the Auditorunder special headings in the Cash Summary for the year concerned.   Upon receiptof that return for any year duly certified by the Government Auditor, the amountdue to the Society or Branch under the scheme of  recoupment will be placed tothe credit of  the Society in its current account  with the Commissioners.    10. For  periods prior  to 1st  January, 1917, steps must at once be  taken toearmark  the payments made and overpayments recovered up to 31st December,1916, inclusive, and to extract the necessary particulars for the purpose of submittinga  claim  to  the Commissioners  on Form  446a/A.G.D., copies  of  which  will  beissued shortly.   The necessary credit will be given to  Societies  aft^er the  formshave  been certified by  the Government Auditors.May, 1917.
                                                        Circular  A.S.  163B.IMPORTANT.This Circular is issued on behalf of the InsuranceCommissioners for England,  Scotland, Ireland,and Wales.             NATIONAL  HEALTH   INSURANCE.        National Insurance (Part  I Amendment) Act, 1917.    1. Approved Societies are  aware that the scheme of pensions  for disablementin consequence of the war has recently been revised.  Details of the new  schemewill be found in the Royal Warrant and the Order in Council (Parliamentary Paper 64,price 3d.).    These  changes necessitated  a  reconsideration of the position in relation  toinsurance benefits of certain classes of pensioners and the National Insurance (Part 1Amendment) Act,  1917, which received the Royal assent  on 17th May, 1917, giveseffect to the new arrangements which have been made.  The object of this  circularis to explain the provisions of the new Act and  to indicate to Societies the stepswhich should be taken in dealing with cases which are affected by these  provisions.    2. The persons affected by the new  Act fall into two main classes :         I. Those who are granted pensions in respect of disablement in the highest          degree.       II. Those who on or after 1st April, 1917, are awarded gratuities (in  place of          pensions) of not less than  30, any part  of which is in respect of temporary          total disablement.          I.-Pensions  in respect of  Disablement in the Highest Degree.    3. These pensions correspond in the main to the old Total Disablement  (War)Pensions.  But, as the new Warrant allows of the award of a permanent  pension fordisablement in the highest degree for specific injuries which do not necessarily entailincapacity for  work and it would, therefore, be  inequitable to make  a  permanentreduction in the rate of benefit of men who proved that they had resumed  more orless regular employment, an important; modification has been  made  in the  corre-spending insurance provisions.  In the cdse of a discharged man who has been awardeda pension in respect of disablement in the highest degree, the ordinary rate of sicknessbenefit  is to be reduced by 5s. a week and he is  not entitled to disablement benefit while in receipt of that pension, with the following important qualifications  :        (i) as regards sickness benefit, if and  when he has since his discharge  from          the Navy or Army been in insurable employment for 26 weeks,  whether          consecutive or not, and 26 contributions have been paid in respect of him,          he will no longer be  subject to any reduction of sickness benefit even          though his pension continues ;  and       (ii) as regards disablement benefit, if and when he has since his discharge been          in insurable  employment for 104 weeks, whether  consecutive or not, and          104  contributions have been paid in respect of him, he will regain his right          to disablement benefit even though his pension continues.    [Note. When a person claims to have requalified the Act requires that he should satisfy his Society         that his remuneration was such as to provide a substantial contribution towards  his means         of livelihood in each week of employment.  A requirement of this kind is necessary in order          to exclude from  the qualifying period weeks for which contributions are paid for nominal          work only ; see paragraph 12.]     4.  There are two classes of discharged men who are to be treated in  all  respects   if they were in receipt of pensions  in respect of disablement in the highest degree,  viz. : -        (i) Men who are granted  an allowance in lieu of a pension while  undergoing          a special course of medical treatment or undergoing  treatment  in  an          institution or receiving training in a  technical institution or otherwise.    [Note. The allowance in these cases will amount to not less than a pension in respect of disable-          ment in the highest degree.]    (B1633) Wt. 8817-G6810.  30000. 5/17. Sir J. 0. k S. Qp. 33.
2        (ii) Men who are in receipt of a Total Disablement War Pension granted before             1st April,  1917.                It is intended to reassess these pensions,  but until the reassessment            is made the pensions must be treated as if they were pensions in respect            of disablement in the highest degree.     5. It should be carefully noted that although a  man in receipt of a pension or allowance to which the Act applies cannot requalify for the ordinary rate of benefit until the  date  of the  passing of the Act, the period for requalifying dales from the member&apos;s discharge.    In the case of a man who was discharged more than 26 weeks before the passing of the Act, therefore, the  qualifying  conditions may have been fulfilled before  that date and the ordinary rate of benefit may be payable from that date.  Further, if there is an interval between the date of discharge and the date from which the pension or allowance in lieu of a pension is  granted the member may have fulfilled (or partly fulfilled)  the qualifying conditions before he becomes entitled to the pension or allowance.     6.  It  should also be noted that the foregoing instructiors regarding pensions and allowances in lieu of pensions apply only to the period during which the member remains in receipt of the pension for disablement in the highest degree, and that as soon as the pension or allowance ceases or is reduced  the man is to be treated as an  ordinary member  and  the  requirements  regarding  fresh   waiting  periods immediately cease to have effect.     7.  The  procedure  explained in Circular A.S.  163 will  remain in force with little modification.  A pension  in respect of disablement in  the highest degree  or an allowance in lieu of such a pension will in future be shown on the pensioners Identity Certificate as a &quot; 100 per  cent,  disablement &quot;  pension.   The  Commissioners will, where possible, notify Societies of  the award  of pensions to which the provisions apply  and  will also show on the notification whether the  Ministry of Pensions have withheld anything from arrears of pension.     Societies should continue to pay benefit at the unreduced rate until they ascertainthat the member has been awarded a pension or allowance to which these provisionsapply.  They have the same means of recovering the difference between the unreducedand the reduced rate  of benefit as in the case of the old Total Disablement (War)Pensions.    Example 1.        Member discharged 4th  April, 1917, and awarded a permanent pension of 27s. Od. a week             from that date.        Ordinary rate of  Sickness Benefit, 10s.        Incapable of work from discharge to 31st May, 1917.        Entitled to 5s. a  week for 8 weeks and 1 day.        Commences to work regularly, 1st June, 1917.        Employed continuously from 1st June to 10th September, then becomes incapable of work,             and remains incapable until 1st October, 1917 (3  weeks).  Entitled to 5s. a week  for             3 weeks.        Completes  26 weeks in  his employment and payment of  26 weekly  contributions.  In-             capable of  work  from 28th December,  1917, and remains incapable for 17 weeks.            Entitled to 10s. a week sickness  benefit for 14 weeks  5 days (the balance of the 20            weeks).  Not entitled to disablement benefit, as he has not been employed and insured            for 104 weeks since discharge.   Example  2.        Member discharged 16th May, 1917, and awarded a temporary pension of 27s. 6d. a week            from that date.        Ordinary rate of Sickness Benefit 7s. a  week.        Incapable of work for 3 months after discharge.        Entitled  to 2s. a week for 3 months.        Pension reduced to 13s. 9d. a week from 16th August, 1917.        Becomes incapable of work on 19th September, 1917.        Entitled  to 7s. a week sickness benefit for the remainder of 26 weeks of sickness, if he            remains incapable of work for so long, and to disablement benefit under the ordinary            conditions.   Example 3.        Member discharged on 21st July, 1916,  and awarded a partial  disablement pension from that           date.  Awarded a temporary pension for total disablement from 1st March, 1917.        Ordinary rate of Sickness Benefit, 10s.
         Employed for  26  weeks between  21st July, 1916, and 1st March, 1917, and paid 26             contributions.         Incapable of work from 1st March, 1917.         Entitled to Sickness Benefit at the rate of 5s. a week up to 16th  May, and 10s. a week             from 17th May (date of passing of the Act).         Not entitled to disablement benefit, as he has not been employed and insured for 104 weeks             since discharge.                       n. Gratuities in Place of Pensions.     8.  Men  discharged on account  of neurasthenia and  other  nervous affections found to be due to or aggravated  by war service are, in certain  of the  less serious cases, granted  a gratuity in place of a pension on  the ground that the  grant of  a pension would be actually injurious to the  man as it  would tend to confirm his conviction that he is unfit for work.  The regular receipt of sickness  benefit would have the same detrimental effect  on the man&apos;s condition, and it  has therefore been decided that in the case of any insured man  who is granted a gratuity exceeding a certain amount, any portion of  which is in respect of a temporary total disablement, the  gratuity will be increased by  a sum equivalent to  26 weeks&apos;  sickness benefit. The Act accordingly  provides  that in the  case of a man who has been granted a gratuity of not less than  30 in place of a  pension any portion  of  which is  in respect of a temporary  total disablement  he will not be entitled to any sickness or disablement benefit until he  proves that  since his discharge from the  Navy  or Army he has been in insurable  employment for 26  weeks and that 26 contributions have been paid in respect of  him.  If, however,  he is subsequently  awarded  a pension these provisions will at  once ceaiie to apply to him.  His position  will then be determined by reference to the  pension awarded, i.e., if  he is  granted a pension in respect  of disablement in  the highest degree, the arrangements in paragraph  3 will  apply  to him, while if his pension  is  in respect of disablement in  a  lesser degree his  right to  benefits under  the National Insurance  Acts will be  in no way affected by the fact that  he is in receipt of a pension.     This provision takes  effect  from the date of the award of the gratuity or from 17th May,  1917, the  date of the  passing of the Act, whichever is the later date. The  member will be entitled  to benefits  at the ordinary rate  during the period  (if any) between (a) the  date of his  discharge and  (6) the date of  the  award of the gratuity or the 17th May, 191.7, whichever is the later date.     9. When a person to whom the above provision applies proves that he has been in insurable employment since discharge for 26 weeks and that 26 contributions have been paid in respect of him, his right to benefits is exactly the same as if  he had not been subject to the provision,  e.g., the  104  weeks of insurance  for qualifying  for disablement benefit will run from the date of his entry into insurance and all con- tributions paid since that date will be taken into account.     [Note. It is important to note that the above provision applies only to gratuities             granted in place of war pensions. It does not aprply to gratuities granted             to men whose unjitness is neither due to nor aggravated by war service.             The latter gratuities do not affect in  any way whatever the benefits  to             which the recipients may be entitled.&apos;]     10.  A man to whom  a gratuity of the kind dealt with in paragraph  8 has beenawarded will be informed by the Ministry of Pensions on notification  of the awardthat  he is not entitled to sickness or disablement benefit under the National InsuranceActs until he has been in insurable employment for 26  weeks after discharge and26 contributions have been paid in  respect of  him.   Societies should therefore beforepaying benefit to a  discharged man to whom  a gratuity has  been awarded ascertainwhether his gratuity is one to which  these arrangements apply.    It has  also been arranged that the Ministry of Pensions will  as far as possibleascertain before the date of the award the  particulars  of  Society membership inevery case in which a gratuity of the kind in question is granted,  and the Commis-sioners will, wherever  possible, notify the Society concerned on  Form 256 /A.G.D.   Example  1.        Member discharged 30th May, 1917, and awarded a gratuity of  40 for neurasthenia on that            date.        Ordinary rate of sickness benefit, 10s.        Does no work before 1st August, 1917, and is not entitled to sickness benefit,  although            certified incapable of  work for the whole or part of the period.
         Becomes employed on 1st August, 1917, and continues in employment until 9th February,            1918, and pays 26 contributions.         Incapable of work on 10th February, 1918, and remains incapable of work for 30 weeks.         Entitled to sickness benefit at 10s. a week for 26 weeks, and if 104 weeks have elapsed since            date of entry into insurance and 104 contributions have then been paid, entitled to dis-            ablement benefit for the remaining 4 weeks of incapacity.   Example 2.         Member discharged 1st April, 1917, and awarded a gratuity of  50 for neurasthenia.         Ordinary rate of sickness benefit, 10s.         Entitled to sickness benefit  at 10s. if incapable of work until  16th May,  1917.         Not entitled to any benefit  from 17th May,  1917 (date of  passing of the Act)  until 26            weeks of insurable employment have been completed and  26 contributions have been            paid.                 HI. General Provisions applicable  to I. and II.    11. The Act provides  that  while the member is subject to a reduced  rate ofsickness benefit or is disentitled  to sickness or disablement benefit by  reason of thereceipt of a pension or gratuity no arrears will accrue against him.*    12. The Act requires that the member must prove that the  employment in theperiod of 26 weeks or  104 weeks  to qualify again for sickness or disablement benefit issuch that the remuneration derived therefrom provides each week a substantial contri-bution towards his means of livelihood.    On receipt of a claim for benefit therefore after the expiration of 26 weeks fromthe date of the members discharge  the Society should, unless from information inits possession  (e.g., notice of sickness, unstamped  contribution cards) it is clear thatthe member has not been in employment for 26  weeks, send to the member acommunication explaining  the conditions under which the normal benefits  becomepayable  and asking him        (i) to state whether he has been in insurable  employment for 26 weeks and          26  contributions have been paid in  respect of him since discharge ;  and          if so       (ii) (a) to forward his current contribution card, and          (b) to give the names of his employers and the exact periods of employment              since  discharge.On receipt of this information the Society should in  cases of  doubt verify the state-ments by reference  to the  employers.  Where  the employment is regular and therehas only been one employer the  Society will probably find no difficulty in satisfyingitself whether the employment has been boria fide and substantial.   But where thereare considerable intervals  of  unemployment during  the qualifying periods carefulenquiry will probably be necessary in order to ensure that no  week is included inwhich the employment was not  genuine.    The same procedure  should be followed when  the  possibility of  the  memberbeing qualified for disablement benefit arises, i.e., when 104 weeks have elapsed sincethe date of the member&apos;s discharge and he has exhausted his right to sickness benefit.This  does not apply to men in receipt of gratuities in place  of pensions who,  whenthey  have been in insurable employment 26 weeks  since discharge and 26 contri-butions have been paid, are entitled to count all contributions  paid since date of entryinto insurance towards the 104  required for disablement benefit.May, 1917.    * Weeks for which no contributions are paid while the member is subject to reduction of benefit oris disentitled to benefit should be included in Column 8 of the Contribution Register for the currenthalf-year or the corresponding column of the Register for a subsequent half-year.

Nathan. 1* Neurasthenics.        Major C.G, Hamilton K.P., was present and explained theoffer of  Woodbourno near Manchester by Mr J. Leigh  for use as aNeurasthenic Hospital,   Mr Leigh1s desire was that It, should beused for Officers.   In the discussion which followed a doubt wasexpressed as to whether  it was needed for the case of NeurasthenicOfficers  or at all events-, for the number - 50 increasing to 100 -who might be accommodated there.   Sir A. Boscawen pointed out. thatGolders Green was full and that there was a waiting list; more accojnmodation for men would be needed especially near llsnchester and forthem Woodbourne would be very suitable.   The period for treatmentwould probably be 3 to 6 months and it seemed doubtful whether Wood-                         4bourne, even for 50 beds-. - could be kept full if used for Officers.Sir A. Boscawen agreed to write a letter of explanation to KcjorHamilton, who would communicate with Mr Leigh.       As to staff, Sir J. Collie could probably arrange; theMinistry would contribute to maintenance under the new Warrant; theManagement should be by a local committee which Mr Leigh would nodoubt arrange for assisted by expert advico from some existing  In-stitution in the neighbourhood.2.    The Minutes of the last meeting were taken as read and passedsubject tp the correction under  Tuberculosis  of &quot;small pavilions&quot;instead of &quot;small temporary pavilions&quot; and of &quot;St HelenV insteadof &quot;Eccles&quot;.       Arising out of the Minutes Mr Stanley read the letter fromMaida Vale Hospital dated 26th Harch relating to the cost ofmaintenance at Highfield - Goldcr^s  Green.    Sir M.  Nathan stated                                                            that
that the  Ministry were in communication with the Treasury.     Mr Stanley asked why it was provided with reference to theRecouperation Hostel that the charge per capita aJaould notexceed that at Golders Green.   air A. Boscawen explained thecircumstances and that whilst the Hostel would be entitled toreceive- payments from the Ministry it was not thought  expedientthat the  rate should exceed that at Golders Green.3,    Highfield Golders Green. Home of Recovery.   Mr Stanleystated  that the estimates of expenditure on equipment, etc.,might be  somevfhat  exceeded.    Sir A. Boscawen called attentionto the proposal to purchase Major Fraser&apos;s equipment. Tor IntensiveCultureat a valuation;.   Mr Stanley stated that the Red CrossSociety would find the money subject tc a valuation approved &quot;bytheir Surveyor.4.        A letter relating to the Foot&apos;s Cray Hospital  forfacial injuries was considered.   It was understood that theCambridge Hospital at Aldershot. was to be moved there.  The RedCross Society were finding  6-2.000 out of a proposed expenditureof  67.000 and will probably take the Hospital over.  Should thisbe done the Red Cross would come to the Ministry of Pensions formaintenance in respect of any discharged  soldiers who might bethere.    But at present there is no question for Settlement bythe Institutional Committee.5.    A Minute from Sir M. Uathan calling attention to the proposedestablishment, of a  home for Paraplegics at Ellerslie House,Nottingham was considered.   Some discussion followed -  Dr Fox-Symons- thought the men were much happier in such homes than inHospitals, and the Ellerslie Home might serve a similar purpose toLonsdale  House.   It was agreed that there should be some means ofcertifying all cases sent to such Homos as suitable, since otherwise-the grants under the Warrant could not be paid.
      &quot;EUiborculosis   Dr  Hartley read a letter which he had ad-dressed to the Permanent Secretary- explaining the Scheme for provl-ding for advanced cases.   Mr Stanley stated that it had the ap-proval of the Red Cross  Society which would build the pavilionsand after the War present them to the Institutions- on the under-standing that the Red Cross would retain the right to  a certainnumber of nominations; say 25 per cent of the beds; it was not in-tended  to restrict these nominations to &quot;Red Cross Workers&quot;.       Discussion followed on the procedure to be followed inthese cases.   Sir A. Boscawen explained the distinction in theRegulations between the  cases of men who were about to be dischargedfor whom arrangements would be made centrally and the cases whichwould come under the purview of the Local Committees.   Some &amp;p-prehension was expressod as to the possibility of friction withthe Insurance Commissioners;  it was recognised that the res-ponsibility for provision rested with the Commissioners in thefirst instance, but that the Commissioners were not required to                                              4supply full accommodation and that the proposal now made would bea means to cover a possible deficit.    Dr Hartley stated that thecost of the Pavilion; for 12 beds would be about  940, exclusive ofdrainage and water supply.  Sir Harcourt Clare had approved of theproposed pavilion at Bury.   It was agreed that in all cases acommunication ought to be addressed to the Joint Advisory Com-mittecr. before any action was taken.   It was recommended accord-ingly that the Ministry should communicate with the LancashireCommittee about the pavilions- at Bury and St Helens and with theWest Midland Committee when established.   It was further agreedthat it Yjas expedient to ask the Local Government Board to c;om-municate with the Local Authority owning any Asylum where apavilion was to be built-   It was understood that the LocalGovernment Board wero pre paised to approve the Scheme and desired                                                              to
up to 35/- a week per patient..         The Committee approved the Scheme in principle andsanctioned the proposed expenditure at Bury;, St Helena andBirmingham.

Our Inspector reporting on the County WexfordLocal Committee states that the work seems to be effectively doneand the Regulations are correctly carried out.   Up to thepresent no Disablements Committee haB been formed but it is hopedthat this will shortly be done; thore are 150 discharged anddisabled sailors and soldiers on the Register and there areprobably othors who have not yet notified their return.   Asthere are several local industries, these men should be trained assoon as possible with a view to getting permanent employment.          Reporting on County Waterford Local Committee, the sameInspector remarks that the Local Committee is composed of 29members who meet once a month when the work of tho Sub-Committeesis reported to them.   There are seven of these Sub-Committeesand they seem to adhoro to the Regulations.   Nc  DisablementsCommittee has yet been formed but this question trill bo broughtup at the next meeting of the Local Committee.   There are notmany discharged and disabled sailors and soldiers in the County.          Reporting on Halifax Local Committee our Inspectorstatea that this Committee is giving all the attention it possiblyoan to disabled men.   Tho Register is complete and contains 506names up to tho present.   Every case is investigated.   Twowhole-time visitors,, both discharged soldiers, have been appointedto deal with disabled men, while two Hospital Visitors wereappointed within a week of receiving tho Circular.   All oases arethoroughly gone into and grants are striotly in acoordanoo withthe Regulations.   Any doubtful caso is referred to tho local fund.          Roporting on Burnloy Local Committee, our Inspectorstates with regard to disabled soldiers that tho difficulty isfinding other than heavy work in this District causes much troubleto the Committee and consequently payments under the Rogulationsare very heavy.   A great deal of work is done by this LocalCommittee and the irregularities to which he called attention ata previous visit have ceased.          Our Inspoctor, roporting on Cambridgeshire LocalCommittee states that he found the work very thoroughly porformed.He was asked by the Local Committoe for a definite pronouncomenton the question of payment of travelling and subsistence expensesof the Members.   He had an interview with two of tho LabourMembers of the Committee who said that they had been and were on manyCommittees but that this Local Committoe was tho best and the mostsympathetic of those on which they served.
r              Reporting  on Willesden Local  Committee  our   Inspector  states  that  this  Committee  consists  of  17 members   and  meeSs  enee  a  fortnight, while a Sub-Committ^s of  throe   is authorised to  make  advances undsr  Regulation 6 in  naaes   of urgency, their decision  being subject  to  confirmation   by the full Committee.   Practically  all  oases are  visited   before a payment  is  made and  a doctor&apos;s certificate is   always obtained before a grant is given in cases  of illness.   The case work seams  to be well done and the  workers oompotent.                  DISABLEMENTS  BRANCH.   Report of  the Training Section.1.            The Glasgow Local Committee have bnen informed   that commercial training can  only be  sanctioned  if  it is to   be given in an  Institute recognised by the Public Education   Authority  and not at a private institution.2.            It  has been decided not to sanction a flat  rate   exceeding  7/6 per man  per week at the Manchester  School of   Technology unless special grounds are Shown.3.            The commercial  training at Marsh&apos;s School proposod   by th$ Warrington Local School has been approved  merely as   an interim arrangement, and pending the sanction  to a general   scheme for Lancashire  which would  include such training.4.            The Norfolk Local Committee have been requested  to   communicate with  the other  Local  Committees  in their  joint   area on the question of their scheme  for  training men in   Horticulture  and  to  report  further when they have done  so.5.            The schemes for training  men  at  the  Church  Army   Home at flampstead have been referred  to the  Board cf   Agriculture  and the  Cowdenheath  scheme submitted  by the   Fifeshire  Local Committee has been  referred  to the  Ministry   of Labour.6.             Six discharged  soldiers have  completed  their   training,  as  arranged  by  Local  Committees and  approved  by   the Statutory Committee and have  obtained employment; two   as motor drivers, one  as  a  gardener,  one  as  a  vulcaniser,   one as a Cinematograph operator  and  one as a switchboard   attendant.7.             Sanction has  been given  in 26 cases  to  proposals   for training  individual men and  in  24 other  cases further   information is  being obtained.Report of .tho Health Section.1&apos;              The  Section has  received  information  that at   present the number  of discharged men who  are  epileptio and   also mentally defective is not  sufficient to  warrant the   making of special arrangements  for their  accommodation.
g0             A communication has  been received  from the   Buckingham Local Committee  sayin? that  the Royal  Buckingham   Eospital and the General Hospital,  Northampton, have  consent-   ed to give in-patient treatment  to  discharged  men at  30/-  and   28/- per week respectively.3.             A letter has been received  from  the Local   Government Board (Ireland)  saying that  there is no apparent   reason for the provision of special institutions  for  the   treatment of discharged men who  are in  the advanced stage  of   Tuberculosis.4.             Schemes for the medical treatment  of  discharged   men have been received from Norwich, Swansea,  Londonderry,   Plymouth and West Bromwich  Local Committees, and  in each  case   a part of the scheme has been approved  while certain   suggestions are being made  to the Local Committees concerned   with reference to the remainder.

The  Statutory  Committee.                -0-THE first number of the Gazette was opened    with a fore word by Mr. Barnes.  In  thepresent  number the Statutory Committee givetheir reasons in a letter to the Prime Minister,printed elsewhere in these columns, for believingthat they should hand over their functions to thePensions Minister.  When the  Committee  wereappointed  under the Act  of  1915  there wasuo Pensions  Ministry;  pensions  were  givenunder  the  War  Office  and  Admiralty; theywere often inadequate to  meet the  wants  ofthe men in the new Army whose pre-war posi-tion was of an infinite variety.  The  StatutoryCommittee were authorised to supplement Statepensions,- or, in cases  where under the  some-what   rigid rules  of the Government  Officesno pension was awarded, to  take an equitablelather  than a  strictly legal view, and to give^lowances although the Government Departmentshad decided that the particular individuals  didnot come within the Warrants or Orders in Council.Another function of the Statutory Committee wasthe care of disabled officers and men after they hadleft the service and the provision  of treatment,training and employment, matters which had notbeen considered as within  the  purview of theGovernment Departments.  For these purposesthe Committee had to make Eegulations and inorder that they should be earned out sympatheti-cally and properly, Local Committees were estab-lished  throughout  the  country.  The  StatutoryCommittee itself is a very composite body includingmembers of both  Houses of Parliament, repre-sentatives of  Government Departments,  and oflabour, women and other persons closely associatedwith the voluntary agencies who had previouslyassisted the. sailors and soldiers and  their families.The country owes a great debt of gratitude to theVoluntary Associations  and Committees  whichcovered the ground before the Local Committeeswere established.   The Statutory Committee ap-pealed  to the patriotism of these bodies to  carryon their work till the new organisation was ready,and in no part of the country  was the appealdisregarded.  To them the thanks  of the wholecommunity  are due ; it  was through then1 helpthat the transfer of all the work of supplementingseparation allowances was affected without anybreach  of continuity and without any suffering tothe thousands of dependants of sailors and soldiers.  The Special Disablements Sub-Committee of theStatutory Committee  includes among others sixmembers of Trade Unions,  six large employers,two men connected with the Co-operative move-ment,  one  experienced  in  technical  education,and representatives of the Board of Trade, NationalHealth  Insurance, Board of Agriculture, the LocalGovernment Board, the  Labour Ministry, theAdmiralty, the War Office and the  Medical Pro-fession.  The Sub-Committee have done much to preparethe ground and to solve the difficult problem of theassistance of disabled men.  In questions of health they have been in constantcommunication with  the   Military and  CivilHospital Authorities, with the Local Government
10THE  WAS PENSIONS  GAZETTE.June, 19]Board, with the^ National Health Insurance Com-missioners and  with the Board of Control andAsylum  Authorities.  They  have  made prelim-inary arrangements for additional accommodationfor special classes of cases such as Epileptics andNeurasthenics.   In matters of  technical  education  they haveconsulted the Board of Agriculture and the direc-tors of Technical Schools throughout the country.They have given much consideration to the formsof industry best suited for disabled men and haveobtained the assistance of the Ministry of Labourin setting up Advisory Trade Boards consisting ofrepresentatives of Employers and of Labour.   With regard to openings in Industry they haveco-oporated with the Employment Exchanges andhave brought the  men&apos;s needs before Chambers ofCommerce.   They have given great attention  tothe  subject of Wages  and with the assistance  ofthe Parliamentary Committee of the Trade UnionCongress have approached the Board of Trade andthe  Labour Ministry and arranged for the estab-lishment of Wages Boards to advise on the justremuneration of men unable to earn the Standardrates.   The Statutory Committee have every reason  tobe proud  of the work  they have achieved in thesixteen  months  during which they have been  inexistence.  Their first work was the organisation ofLocal Committees.   Upon them the whole successof the  Act  depended.  Their  composition wascarefully  considered  and  it  was  decided thatgenerally  one-fifth should  be representative  oflabour, one-fifth nominated by the  old voluntaryAssociations, and one-fifth  women.  It  was theduty of  the  Local  Authorities  to  prepare theSchemes and to  appoint  the  actual personnelwhich of course included many representatives  ofthe County Councils and Municipalities.  For thefirst  time therefore there have been set up through-out the  country really  representative Committeesable  to bring to bear  upon  the problems   ofthe sailor  and soldier after their discharge  many-sided knowledge  as well  as true interest  andsympathy.  The  Local Committees have provedthemselves effective.  The Begulations which havebeen drawn up by the Statutory Committee andapproved  by the Treasury had  necessarily to beexperimental and subject to modification and havebeen modified from time  to  time.   The  mainprinciple laid down was that as nearly as could bethe family of the sailor or soldier should be restoredto a  standard of comfort reasonably proportionateto their pre-war position. And this principle hasbeen taken as the basis of the new Warrants andOrders in Council.  Further, the general lines  oftraining and treatment of the disabled which havebeen laid down are such that they will form a solidfoundation for any work in the future.  At the end of 1916 Parliament decided that the whole  system  of  pensions  previously  divii between the Departments managing the two gi Services shoidd be brought together under a i Pensions Ministry, and they decided also to pi tho Statutory  Committee  under  the  Ministi control, but Avithout repealing the Act of IS In March, 1917, a promise was given in the Ho of Commons that an Appeal Tribunal with po to revise decisions as to Pensions should be set not  under  the  control  of  the  Minister. &apos;J Statutory  Committee  have  decided  that it expedient that they should stand aside  and nil the Minister sole control.  They have been mai guided by the extreme inconvenience that rest from  a divided responsibility.  They  have  : that the Local Committees must have direct acc to the Minister ultimately responsible without interposition of any other body, and though ti believe that by the very nature of their composil they  have been enabled to  deal with Local G mittees  as  voluntary bodies with  sympathy : insight,  and though  their mutual  relations li; been  throughout of the most  harmonious i pleasant character, they feel that the new Wan; having largely superseded their Eegulations, ; the payments  in future being  derived  from Ministry, the  connection between the Minis and the Local Committees must in future be clo than  at  present.  The  Statutory  Committee cognise  that  there  is  pressure  upon   the li of  Parlia7nent  and  have  offered  to  assist Minister  until  legislation  is  passed  which \ enable him to take over their powers, and  I individual  members  are   willing  to  place then&apos;  experience  at his disposal  should he des their assistance in  any  advisory capacity.  Tl have  devoted  much time  and thought to i work  ; there have been meetings of sub-conm tees nearly every day,  and their Chairmen h: spent many hours in the  office  daily ; the  * - Sections have sat day after  day to give perso) attention to the recommendations of the  Loi Committees.  The Statutory Committee are si that  the  members of  the  Local  Commit U will not relax their efforts for the sailors ii soldiers.  The  supplements   hitherto given * not be necessary,  and  instead  of them  Loi Committees will have the opportunity of helpi the Minister to assess alternative  pensions  bas on pre-war  income.  The  need  for  treatnic and training, on  the other  hand,  will   gri With  regard to the former it  is  essential illit   should   be  given   speedily,  and   the  in Warrant  confers on the Minister a  power enforcing treatment under penalty  of loss of 1)the pension which has never  been possessed by tStatutory Committee.   The question of train iis  more complex, and seeing that at the monwemployers require every kind of labour, that evdisabled men can easily  earn high wages  and th
JUNE,  1917.THE WAR PENSIONS  GAZETTE.11  he Nation  needs the  work  of every  one,  it  is  lossible that Schemes for training will not be fully  feveloped before the war is over and the soldiers  jeturn to their normal occupations after demobili-  [ation.   In one direction, however, there may be  Led for action outside the Ministry.  The new  Warrants are liberal, and it is believed that the  llinister intends to give them a wide interpretation  End to  admit  many cases previously  excluded.  (Under  any  Government Department,  however,  ndividuals   cannot  always  be  considered  upon  [heir merits  but must be brought under the letter  U  some law.   The  Committee therefore  suggest  that some outside body with greater freedom than j. Government Department would possess shall be Intrusted with funds to be used for cases of hard- phip or for the benefit of persons requiring special assistance which cannot be given under the Rules fcowever elastic  of a Government Office.  There pre many local funds  still in  existence, some of  dm under  independent Committees.   It  is  not Ipossible  to  prevent voluntary  Societies  being started  for special objects, and  it is not certain that Local Committees appointed under Statute (should be the bodies to disburse voluntary funds as well as the State monies which they are asked Ito  distribute.   It may  be  that  the  Statutory  Local Committees formed  by  public authorities  sith due representation  of labour will  graduallylabsorb other  voluntary efforts and will be adjudgedI mo st suitable to administer both classes of funds ;Ibut it seems  certain that if a Central Fund is to be(subscribed for any purpose  it  must be appealedI for  and distributed by  a body independent of  theIGovernment, and for that reason the StatutoryICommittee are proposing that the voluntary fundsI in their possession should be handed over to  the Royal Patriotic Fund  Corporation to which  theCommittee are affiliated.  The members of the  Statutory Committee very much regret  that they will  be dissociated from the  work  that  they  have  initiated,  but  they believe that as a Central body they have preparedthe ground, and that Central Administration shouldbe  left   to   a  permanent department.   It  willdevolve  on  the  Local  Committees  to  devotethemselves to  the care  of  individual men  andwomen  in their  areas  and  to  supplement  theefforts of the  Pensions  Ministry.  The  countryexpects that everything possible should be done tomark appreciation of the sacrifices of our sailors andsoldiers  and to ensure as far as may be. that theyand their dependants  shall suffer no loss from theirservice.   The Nation is determined that thereshall be no complaint that those who have foughtare  forgotten when the war is over.  It is to theLocal Committees that the men will look for humansympathy, and it will be for the Local Committeesto add  to  the official organisation the  vivifyingtouch of personal interest and care.                          CYRIL  JACKSON.The  Letter to the  Prime Minister.                                 Wlh April, 1917. SIR,   I am directed by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee to state that they have carefully considered their present position and the way in which the functions entrusted to  them by the Naval and  Military &apos; War Pensions, &amp;c, Act,  1915, can best be performed, regard being had to the  establishment  of the  Ministry of Pensions.  They have come to the conclusion that in the public interest,  and also in that of those for whose benefit the Statutory Committee were constituted, it is desirable  that their functions should, subject to the necessary modifications, be transferred to the Minister of Pensions.  Accordingly, at their meeting to-day, they passed a Resolution to  this effect, and  directed that copies of it should be sent to you and to the Pensions Minister.  The Resolution is as follows :     That in the opinion of the Statutory Committee the        time  has arrived  when their functions under        the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c., Act,        1915, should, subject to the necessary modifica-        tions, be transferred to the Minister of Pensions.  As you are  aware, the Act of 1915 was  passed &quot; to make better provision as to the pensions,  grants and allowances made in respect of the present war to officers and men  in  the Naval and  Military. Service  of His Majesty and their dependants, and the care of officers and men disabled in consequence of the present war, and for purposes connected therewith,&quot; and it provided for the constitution of the  Statutory  Committee with a view to giving effect to the objects of the Act.  The members of  the Committee willingly accepted appointment, and they have done their best to carry out their functions and to further the interests of those for whose benefit the Act was passed.  Under Schemes sanctioned by them, more than 300 Local Committees have been established for the purposes of the Act;  they have, with the approval of the Treasury, framed Regula- tions under which supplementary separation allowances are paid by the Local Committees ; further Regulations have been made by them which have formed the basis of the new Royal Warrant and Order in Council relating to Pensions and Grants, and they have done much work with regard to arrangements for the treatment, training and employment of disabled men.  The passing of the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1910, which provides that the powers and duties of  the Com- mittee shall be exercised  under the control and  in accordance with the instructions  of  the  Minister  of Pensions,  and subsequent  developments have entirelyaltered their position.  There is a very cordial feeling between the Committeeand the Minister, and they have  done everything intheir power to assist him  at  the outset of his work. They feel, however, that the present position is anomal- ous, and that the functions now shared  between the Minister and themselves would in the  future be  best carried out by him alone.  They think that it is imprac-ticable,  without grave inconvenience, that they  andalso the Minister should deal with the  same  matters ;they consider that  there should be undivided respon-sibility, and that there  should be only one CentralAuthority, to whom the Local Committees should look  -for guidance and control.  Legislation will, of course, be necessary to give effectto the proposal, and the Statutory Committee wouldurge that such legislation should be obtained as soon as
possible, as some time must be taken up in the requisitetransitional arrangements.  Tbe Committee understand that the re-assessmentsof the pensions of sailors and soldiers and their depen-dants under the Order in Council and the Royal Warrantwill have been finished by the end of Juncyand that tbecorresponding documents relating to officers are nearlyready.  They do not desire to relinquish their  functionsuntil  the arrangements  of  the Pensions Minister arecompleted and they can feel assured that no  hardshipcould result from their retirement to any of those whoreceive  grants under their Regulations.   It would be essential to  secure that the persons whohave  now, or may hereafter have, interests under theRegulations  of  the Statutory Committee,  should  besafeguarded  so that such  persons  may be in no wayprejudiced by  the alteration  in the  arrangements.This  specially applies with respect to grants  madewhere no allowances  or pensions  are payable out ofpublic funds, and also to those for the education of thechildren of deceased or disabled officers and men.   These grants differ in character from those ordinarilyadministered by a Department of the Government, andare in  no way covered by the Royal Warrant or theOrder in  Council.  They are  made under Regulationsapproved by the Treasury, and the fact that they maybe given has been somewhat widely made known.   It may be found desirable that the administration ofthese grants  should be entrusted to the Royal PatrioticFund Corporation, who already carry out kindred work,if they are willing to  undertake it, and that  a capitalsum of suitable amount should be transferred to themfrom the sum cf  1,000,000 placed at the disposal of theStatutory Committee under Section 1 of the Naval andMilitary War Pensions, &amp;c. (Expenses) Act, 1910.   The  Statutory Committee are in possession of somefunds voluntarily  subscribed for specific purposes,  andthey  suggest that these too might be transferred to theRoyal Patriotic Fund  Corporation, and bo administeredby that body, particularly as in some instances  the fundswere derived from them.   The  Committee  presume that  provision would  bemade for the transfer  to the Pensions Ministry of theirstaff, whose  interests they would  wish to  have  safe-guarded.  In particular, they would desire that theirSecretary should be placed in a position of not less valuethan that which he now occupies.   I am directed to add that if the Minister of Pensionsat any time feels that the experience gained by membersof the Statutory Committee or of their Sub-Committeeswould be of service to him, it would be freely  placed athis disposal.   The Statutory Committee have sent a copy of thisletter to the Minister of Pensions, and they hope it maybe found practicable to give effect to their wishes.

The Minister is prepared to sanction the storting olsimilar institution for Ireland,  but is generally of opiniothat the care of the blind is fortunately not such a himatter that it cannot be centrally undertaken, and ihaif two or three Nat ional  centres work closely toge! kthe  treatment, training,  and aftercare  can  be HUTeffectively carried  out than  in a  larger&apos; number &apos;institutions distributed over the  Kingdom.                     -o-  Mr. Ilineks, who gave in our first issue, an account &apos;the  work of the Leicestershire  Local  Committee, lia                 received from the Pensions Minister;       An       letter  of appreciation of the work i  Appreciation,   that town, from which we extract ill                 following sentences :        &quot; I was particularly struck with your efforts, a     detailed  in the &quot; Gazette,&quot; to deal with the disable     men.

Arrangements are being made  to prevent this  confusion and new Regula- tions of a very simple character will be issued  in place of the present Part 1.                    -o-  Last  month Mr.  Barnes, accompanied  by Sir A. Oilnth-Boscawen visited Brighton.                  He inspected the Brighton School  The  Pensions   of Art and Technical College, where    Minister.    several disabled soldiers  were under-                going  training  in  sign-writing and Hi&apos; rkanical  drawing in the  former, and as  fitters and tinners in  the  latter  institution  which  offers great facilities.  Subsequently  Mr. Barnes visited a munition works employing about 2,000 hands.   The Principals expressed tlieir willingness to receive and train  disabled men and to provide them with regular employment afterwards.  Later  on the same day  Mr. Barnes  inspected  the Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops situated within the grounds ofthe  Brighton Pavilion  Military Hospital  where  550limbless soldiers were under treatment and voluntarytraining.  About 100 men are being instructed in boot making, carpentry,  electrical work, motor mechanics, engineering  and  commercial subjects.  At the beginning of May  the Pensions Minister spent several days in  the North where he  was present at  a meeting of  representatives  of the Glasgow and Westof Scotland War  Pensions Committees,  to   considerthe  formation  of a  Joint Committee  for the pur-pose of preparing and administering schemes for thecare,  health, training and  employment of dischargeddisabled sailors and  soldiers within the  geographicalarea covered by the following counties and burghs : Argyll,  Stirling, Dunbarton,  Bute, Renfrew,  Lanark,Ayr, Wigtown, Kircudbright, Dumfries, Glasgow,  Pais-ley and Greenock.  On the  same day the Minister  visited the Head-quarters and some of the District Offices of the LocalWar Pensions Committee of the City of Glasgow.  He also attended a Conference of Local  Committees,representatives of Northumberland, Durham, Cumber-land,  Westmoreland,  for  similar  purposes,   held atNewcastle-on-Tyne.                 Apprentices.                     -o-^ The Statutory  Committee are experiencing considor-able difficulties in administering Regulations 9 (B) and7 (1)  (F) on account of the condition  which is includedthat,  before an allowance can be sanctioned, it must boshown that the absence of the contribution from the sonlias resulted in hardship.  The Statutory  Committee  recognise  tliat  parentswhose sons were  apprentices at the time of enlistmentmay feel that they are entitled to be placed by the Statein at least as good a position  as parents who allowedtheir boys to enter blind alley occupations, and they aroaware that  many Local Committees share this view.The functions of the Statutory Committee are, however,to obviate hardship and while they  are anxious thattheir  regulations  sliall be administered  in as liberal aspirit as possible they must point out that the terms ofthose regulations  aro definitely  binding on them  and onLocal Committees.  The Statutory  Committee can only administer Regu-lations 9 (B) and 7  (1) (F) justly if they obtain  all thehelp that Local Committees can  give towards arrivingat decisions in individual cases.  In particular they askthat in addition to  the necessary information as to theapprenticeship, estimated present wages, present incomeof the family, etc., Local Committees, where  recom-mending an allowance, should give the grounds on whichthey have come to the conclusion that the condition ofthe Regulation is satisfied.  The Statutory Committee  will always be  glad toreconsider their decision  at the request cf a Local Com-mitteo if additional facts can be brought  forward tosupport the application.                     -o-  The ladies of  Gillingham, Kent, have presented tothe Local War Pensions Committee a new Bath Chairfor the use of wounded sailors and soldiers.

Manchester.                     -o-  Some idea of the task which falls to the Local Com-mittee of a large urban area in carrying out their dutiesunder the War Pensions Acts may be gathered from thefact that the Manchester Committee liave nearly 40,000cases  registered on then- books, of which 11,000  havebeen added as new cases since the Committee &quot; tookover &quot; on the  1st August last.   Many of the difficultiesusually associated with the early stages of a new andcomplex undertaking had already been  solved for theCommittee by their predecessors, the local branch of theS. &amp; S. P. A., whose organisation, built up on a &quot; war &quot;basis under the paternal care of the Municipality and theearly  criticism of a watchful if not always discriminatingPress, provided them with a machine in full workingorder.                    Organisation.   The  Association had organised on a central  plan,and the Local  Committee have considered it advisableto retain this system in preference to tho formation ofdistrict sub-committees, each self-contained and workingmore  or  less  independently.  It  is not intended todiscuss hero the relative merits  of centralisation  anddecentralisation.   Each method of organisation has itsown distinctive features, and no doubt in many boroughs,owing to local conditions, as well as in county areas,War Pensions Committees have found it both desirableand necessary to  perform  their  duties tlirough theagency of sub-committees  appointed on a territorialbasis.   But this can be said for  a centrally-organisedsystem where  the  area, though densely populated,  iscompact and capable of being administered  as a singleunit,  tliat it  facilitates control, secures uniformity oftreatment and tends to economy in working.   Each case  on first application  is registered at thecentral office, or in special circumstances by a visitor atthe home, and the  form, to  which subsequently areattached  all documents relating to tbe case, eg., corres-pondencc, visitor&apos;s reports, official advices, becomes thecase record.  A copy of the form is aLso supplied to theVoluntary Workers&apos;  Committee, whose  workers, apartfrom special enquiries and investigation, undertake theduty of regular visitation.  Great importance is attachedto thoroughness  of  initial  registration.   Experienceshows that a little extra trouble devoted to securing atthe outset a full and accurate statement of the appli-canfs position and circumstances, including verificationof wages, income, etc., as an indispensable part of theregular  routine, is  amply  repaid,  and is  especiallyvaluable  in enabling the Committee promptly to dealwith  recurring applications, which, as  time goes on,inevitably increase in numbers.   All  payments of  a continuing nature,  as well asadvances pending the first receipt of separation allow-ance, are made at the homes of the beneficiaries.  ]&apos;()this  purpose the Committee have availed themselvcof the services  of  the Education Committee&apos;s  scliooattendance.staff.  The cash  is made up  with a form oreceipt in  a specially prepared envelope, upon  whidthe  essential  particulars  are indicated, together wit!any  enquiry the almoner is required to make as to titrecipients continued eligibility for assistance.  Recordof payments are kept on a card system.  A card is madout  for each case,  upon  which are entered  particulaof the payment, the regulation under  which  if is madethe period for which assistance is  authorised, or dale,,revision, and any  special conditions  attaclring  to Higrant.  The cards  for  each  class of  payment, cij,advances,  rent  allowances,  temporary allowances aiiiemergency grants,  are kept  in separate cabinets, and&apos;special cabinet is  used  where payment on  a case iauthorised under more than one  regulation.   Revisioiand control of &quot; live &quot; cases thus becomes  automaticand comparative statistics are available at any time.                   A Week&apos;s Work.   Whilst  figures  alone  cannot  convey an adequalimpression  of the  multifarious activities falling wit)Athe  purview of a Local Committee, an  analysis of ihreturns for a recent week  gives  a general idea of thwork being done.   During the week in question 313 ncicases were registered, including 52 disabled  men, 1,03personal re-applications were dealt/ with apart from tlioscontained in the 000 reports received from the voluntarworkers, and altogether  1,700 callers were interviewsat the central office.   Detailed investigations, for wbi&apos;a special staff is employed, were made in 250 cases, 1of which arose out of enquiries  from paymasters aicentral departments  or  led to  reports  and claims iconnection  with State allowances and pensions.  Ongoing correspondence amounted to 089 letters, in adotion  to  653 circular letters and forms.

I In no department of their activities have the Com- litlee encountered such difficulties as in their disable- Itnts  section with  its 4,300  registered  cases. For lany  months  the confusion and delay attending the lirard and payment of disability pensions  rendered it tell-nigh impossible to do more than  minister to the fcmiediate pecuniary needs of the men and assist them h their pension difficulties.  But this is now a matter If history ; a general improvement in central adrninis- Iralion, a complete co-ordination of effort the advan- [agos  of  which are  beginning  to  reflect  themselves ocally and what  is  also important  better  provision lor the temporary requirements of the  man on his dis- lliarge, have combined to remove a series of drawbacks Much  hampered progress and  hindered  any serious tttompt to grapple  with the problems which concern lie  jiermanent welfare  of the  disabled on organised foes.  Still, much has been done in anticipation  of the aore comprehensive schemes foreshadowed by the new Royal  Warrant and the proposals  now going forward or  a  thoroughly  organised  system  of co-operation miong the 41 Committees in Iiancashire in the matter it training and treatment.                     Training.  Applications for training have been extremely few, principally because of the abnormal demand for labour MHI the high wages obtainable even by men physically incapable of any but the lightest forms of employment Mid without any particular qualifications. What appli- cations have been received, as well as men who could be Persuaded of the  ultimate benefit  of training  for a suitable  occupation  offering prospects  of  permanent employment, have been dealt with individually.  More recently a scheme for training electricity  sub-station attendants, intended to  serve the area of  South-east Uncashire, has been started.   The classes are held in the School of Technology and practical instruction and demonstration is also given in the stations of the Elec- tricity Committee, who have taken  on their  staff the first batch of trained  men.  Under the arrangements which  will doubtless follow on  the inauguration of a County scheme, Manchester will  become an importantcentre for industrial and commercial training.                     Treatment.   In the matter of medical treatment, local  hospitals and institutions have dealt with  numbers  of men  as ordinary  patients.   Sanatorium and domiciliary treat- ment, thanks  to the provision made  by the  Public Health Department, has been placed within the reach of all men suffering from tuberculosis.  And mention must also be made of the splendid effort in East Lanca- shire,  under  the auspices  of the  British  Red  Cross Society, to provide institutions for totally disabled men afflicted with paraplegia. Towards the sum of  100,000 required,  75,000 has already been subscribed, and the first&apos;Home at Broughton, Manchester, has been opened for the reception of patients.  The issue of Circular  35 of the Statutory Committee and the improved arrange- ments for out-patients, mark a real step forward  in regard to treatment.  It would  seem, however,  that with an increasing number of  disabled men  discharged from the hospitals  to  undergo out-patient  treatment, present resources will call for extension, especially for the number of cases, probably more than 50 per cent. of the whole, requiring orthopaedic treatment.  Man- chester is alive to the  need and enquiries are now  on foot as to the possibility of making further provision iin this regard primarily for the benefit of the  discharged soldier.   &quot; Training and treatment cannot be divorced &quot; is a conclusion based upon experience.   It is eminently desirable that the processes should as far as possible  be combined and it is therefore important that centres for treatment should be arranged in close proximity  to centres  for  training.   Two  points of  detail  suggest themselves in coimection with the use of the out-patient treatment card: (1) That men discharged  before the cards  were adopted should be supplied  with  them  as they appear before  a medical  board for the review  of their  pensions,  and (2) That the treatment should generally be within the reach of men discharged mecli- cally unfit without pensions, allowances being provided, as at present, under the Statutory Committee&apos;s regulations.                    Employment.   As regards finding employment for disabled men, the Committee&apos;s  task  is  considerably lightened  by  the admirable work  being  done by the Y.M.C.A.,  whose special bureau, under the control of a Joint Committee, has placed 750 men since its inception nine months ago.                     Conclusion.   The work  entrusted to Local Committees is vitally important to the  welfare of  the whole community. These  Committees are only at the beginning  of theirtask, and the future will see great developments in their work  throughout the country.   The idea needs correction that improvised methods and temporary expedientsin local  organisation and administration will suffice worthily to carry out an undertaking in which technicalknowledge and experience no less than sympathy andpatience  are  essential qualities, and wisdom lies in  arecognition of the  fact  that War  Pensions  work is apermanent addition to the departments of local govern-ment and requires as such a corresponding status, withall that that implies.

The  Treatment  and  Training  of  the                    Disabled.                     -o-     No. 2. The Pilkington  Special Hospital,                St.  Helens (Lanes).                     -o    Early in August of last year the Directors of Messrs.Pilkington Bros(, Sti Helens set about considering newways and means of aiding those who escaped with lifebut with grave disablement from the War, and for whomnormal hospital  experience could  be little more than afirst stage in their return to useful life.   Accordinglythey requested  their Surgeon,  Mr.  James  It.  Kerr,Ch. M., who for ten years liad been dealing continuouslywith industrial  injuries and  particularly  with  thoseinvolving tendons, nerves and muscles, to report on wliatwas being done for disabled French and Belgian soldiers.As Dr. Kerr was then serving France as Midccin Chef ofa base  hospital in the Seine region it was possible for himto have direct knowledge of the methods in use, theresults acliieved and the  views of the Surgeons underwhose  direction  a remarkable work  of restoration wascarried on.  Consequent on his report, the firm at onceproceeded to fix on a  building suitably situated andcapable of being transformed  into  an institution forphysiotherapy and re-education.   They  recalled theirSurgeon.  Before leaving Paris he  placed  orders withFrench makers of those orthopaedic appliances which hadproved of signal service in various hospitals,  but moreespecially  those used  at the  &quot; Grand  Palais&quot;  byM. Jean Camus, Chef du Service do Physiotherapie for themilitary Government of  Paris and for the third Region.  Operations commenced in September, 1910, and therecame into being early in January a completely equippedwell organised,  and commodious establishment at St.Helens the Pilkington Special Hospital for DisabledSoldiers and Sailors.                  Accommodation.  It is now in the fifth month of its work with woundedmen consigned to its care by the Western Command.At  present there is accommodation  for the housing andtreatment of 135 patients and preparations  are beingmade  for  150  more.  The  floor space  for  treatmentworks  out to nearly 150 square feet per man.   It wouldbe  impossible to attempt any  detailed account of therationale and the teclmique of the processes in operationin the  several departments of the hospital.  That thereare well over 2,000 treatments per week, and that eachin a fairly definite way  is virtually  an individual treat-ment provided with regard to specific individual needsmay be taken as adequate explanation for not endeavour-ing within the compass of a short article to answer thequestion as to what it  is precisely that we try to do.A simple sketch, from the lay point of view, of the generallines of the work may prove of interest.                     Treatment.   In the  first place the distinctive character  of this Special Hospital is physiotherapic.   We are dealing notwith disease in its ordinary meaning, but with disaljinents arising from tho accidents of War.  Doubtlessmany  cases  serious  degenerations have occurredsequels to simple lesions, and demand tho approprianormal treatment, and so the scope of work to be domust include at times that of a general hospital.  Jphysiotherapy, however, Js meant the utilisation fremedial purposes of mechanical and physical prineiji.and appliances.   For the sake of efficiency in the usesuch means, and  in order to have  more or less systwatized programmes, physiotherapy  is retained as a taof general description and arrangements are made umspecial titles for  the specialised treatments.   Thushave Electro, Thermo, Hydro, and Mechano rooms v,itheir relative therapeutic agencies.  Tho Massage roiand that for remediahgyninasties play their part \vtworkshops and gardens on  account of their curativowell as their re-educational  value are being used.

So far, the Workshops are in the experimental staIt takes  some time for a disabled man to bo satif lithat there is a promise of  future usefulness for himwork different from that to which he has been accustomThe practical  exercises, therefore)  are arranged to Jihim towards a decision.

The  main ideas at this stagetliat work is an essential factor in happiness, and (1there is a call on everyone for useful production, and mespecially for the raising  of  food  stuffs.  Already 1salutary effects of this side  of  our  treatment onminds of many are beyond  question.   Needless to  say there is nothing haphazard inmethods of  operation.  A  soldier  on  the day afterarrival comes fresh from a nighfs rest in the spacidormitory, and,  free from excitement, to the RecoRoom  whore  ho  passes under review by tho SurgeHis history is considered,  his condition is  noted, \careful measurements of his disablements are made ;reorded.

New Appliances.   If it should be urged tliat in each of the type^treatment spoken of there is nothing really novelmay  be answered that many  of the appliancesentirely new in the sense  tliat tbey  are more efficithan their predecessors.  This applies to tho equipmfor electric diagnosis and massage and is  most  jnouncedly   true  of the  mechano-therapy  apparat

Shoulders, elbows, rrists,  fingers, knees, feet,  back and so  on have then.&quot; pective machines by which the several  groups of auscles are helped to regain their functions, and day by lay the results are recorded quantitatively. Measurements and recordings give its character to the Jlechano room and a fruitful basis cf hope to the patient. The hydro room has baths  for arms and  for legs and a irge whirlpool  bath in which half-a-dozen patients may eceive pleasurable treatment.  The temperature ranges ram 98CF. to 1120 F. as prescribed.   In each bath he water is kept  mechanically in motion and a flow of timpressed ah, through a massage action, adds to the fiiciency of the hot water on skin, sub-cutaneus tissues nut their vascular supply. The  work of the gymnasium  proceeds on the lines laid down by  the Surgeon.  While  improvement in seneral condition  is kept in view, the particular groups nf muscles requiring attention are definitely exercised ind precautions are taken against injury not merely from violence, but also from the stretching of  muscles which through disuse have become feeble. It is not so  much on the facilities and equipment hat the success  of this Hospital depends,  as on the careful adjusting of treatment, the rigorous carrying out of well considered programmes and the maintenance of an earnest and hopeful spirit among the patients.                    Conclusion. With few exceptions the patients sent to this Hospital from the Western Command are wounded soldiers still in the army, seemingly capable of very definite improve- ment.   The re-education of a muscle, the restoration of harmonious action  of muscle  groups,  the  inducing ibility of joints and the improving of injured innerva-tion involve much time and patient effort. The  foregoing  brief references merely indicate  the means  by which curative results are obtained.  It may he  possible later  to deal with details and consider  the iiat me  of the progress of  typical patients  who have benefited in fair  measure from the  orthopa-dic andre-educational treatments provided.          J.G.K.J  A  Note on  the  Paris Conference.                   -o- The Allied Conference on the treatment of disabled dors and soldiers was held  at the Grand  Palais, inaris,  during the week ended May 13th.  The Pensions inistry were represented by Lieut.-Colonel Sir Arthuroscawcn, M.P.  and Major  Mitchell, Adviser to  the -nsions Ministry, while the Statutory Committee was presented  by Lieut.-Colonel B.  A. Stanton, C.M.G.ud the  London Local  Committee  by Sir  Charlesicholson, Bart.  Other members represented the  RedCross, War Office, Admiralty, and the Medical profession.  The  Conference was  divided into  six sections eachdealing with special  considerations.  Papers which hadbeen previously prepared by foreign members had beenprinted and were duly circulated to members attendingthe sittings of the various Sections.  These papers afterbeing read were  discussed and the various resolutionsconsidered and put to the vote.  Visits were  paid  to  several  important  Institutionssuch as the Military Hospital and Training Centre ofSt. Maurice, at Charenton, Maison Blanche, 20 kilometresnorth  of  Paris, the Belgian  Training  Centre at PortVillez  and the Blind Institution  in  the  Rue Reuilly.There was little to be gained in knowledge by the Britishrepresentatives from the questions raised at the varioussittings of the sections.  On the other hand, the visitsto the  various Military  Hospitals and Training Centreswere most useful. The French system  is that in everyarea from which an Army Corps is raised,  there  isestablished a Military Training Centre and Hospital forthe wounded of that Army Corps in the field.  Thesetraining areas,  known as  &quot; region&quot;  are  distributedthroughout the  country, the principal ones  being atLyons, Bordeaux, Limoges, Rennes, Toulouse and St.Maurice, near Paris. Those visited showed that theseestablishments are  extremely  well  adapted  for  thepurpose for which they  are intended, usually large  con-vents with considerable grounds surrounded by a  wallwith  many  out-houses, have been  obtained for  thepurpose of these institutions.  Workshops  erected intemporary buildings have been added  while the largegrounds have  been used for the training of men inagricultural pursuits. It was pointed out that in Francesome  65  per cent,  of  the  disabled men  have  beenagricultural labourers and every effort  is made by theFrench Government to  return to the land any men whohave come from  it.  As a consequence, unless a man&apos;sdisabilities totally incapacitate him for  employment onthe land, he is not usually  taught a trade, the FrenchGovernment  being  afraid   of  the  insufficiency ofagricultural labour  in  the  future development of theCountry.   Where, how ever, a man is injured to such anextent as to prevent his using agricultural implements,he  is taught a trade in one of the following industriesaccording to his choice.  Carpentry,               Boot-making,  Tinsmith work,          Cooperage,   Basket work,            Leather work (Saddlery),  Drawing,                Surveying,   Clerical work,                and Drawing.  A man is detained at a Military Hospital or TrainingCentre  until he  is  cured and fitted with an  artificiallimb.  He is provided  with a spare artificial limb andin case of any damage to either he has only to return itto the Centre from which he obtained it for repairs or anew one to be issued  free of cost.  Aslongasamanremainsin a Military Hospital or Training Institution he is paidas a soldier and on his  discharge he is pensioned underthe Ministry of Interior, drawing his pension from the
Prefects  of the various Departments.  The  work  ofLocal Committees  is unknown, and although there areCivil  Societies,  known as  &quot; Mutuels  Mutiles,&quot;  theseSocieties only deal with cases of disabled men who areunable to earn sufficient money for their own supportfrom such  local  funds  as they are able to collect. Thepension of  a French soldier on discharge may roughlybe taken as half that which his luckier brother-in-arms,the British soldier is in tbe future to receive.   E.A.S.Pensions in  Parliament.Joint  Committees.  The Pensions Minister and his Parliamentary Secre-tary,  Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen  have been activelyengaged in making known throughout tho country theirscheme for the formation of Joint Committees.  The treatment and training of the disabled man  is,without doubt, the most urgent and important branchof the work under the control of tho Pensions Minister.His aim is so to organise the local administration thatany man shall be able to obtain tho necessary treatmentand training immediately on his discharge.  It has now been generally agreed that the areas of thoexisting Local Committees, though perfectly satisfactoryfrom the point of view of separation allowances, supple-mentary  allowances,  and  pensions,  are  not  alwayssufficiently large and varied to deal with the re-educa-tion of the disabled man. The Minister lias, therefore,decided that immediate  steps must be taken to formgroups of  Local Committee areas  throughout GreatBritain and Ireland for the special purposo of dealingwith this problem.  The essential feature, vital to the success of the scheme,is tliat all the resources in any given area should be pooledunreservedly, and tliat in the partition of the country,those resources should, in the case of each Joint Com-mittee, be as varied as possible.  These objects can only bo carried out successfully withthe hearty co-operation  of the Local Committees con-cerned.  In regard to their handling of the disablementwork, different Local Committees aie in different stages ofdevelopment.   In some instances very considerable pro-gress  has been made, local funds have been collected, hos-pitaLs and hostels have been provided by private gener-osity, and an efficient organisation has been set on foot, inother instances, little or nothing has been done.  Theease with which employment of some sort is obtainablehas contributed to  this by  obscuring and even hidingcompletely the existence of the need.  It is a great deal to expect those who liave realised andgrappled with the problem to share their facilities withthe more backward, but this is exactly what the Ministry,and,  we venture to say, the Country, does ask.   It is aplain issue, and cannot be glossed over or ignored.   The best help that  our united resources  can affordshould be at the disposal of every man who has beendisabled in this war,  and that  help should be givenaccording  to his needs  and not according to where  hehappens to reside.                     Pensions.  Mr.  Jowett asked  tho  Pensions Minister  if hestate fully the procedure to be adopted by  applicfor disablement pensions for soldiers and sailors disaby  wounds or  on account of  disease ; pensionswidows and dependants of soldiers and sailors wbo habeen killed in action  or who have died in consequouof wounds or  disease  ; gratuities for widows ; and iother class of pension, allowance, or gratuity admintered through  his Department ?  Mr. Barnes : Tho procedure with regard to applicafor pensions is as follows : Disabled   sailors  No application necessary, unlos   and soldiers       alternative pension as explain                     below is claimed.Widows  ...    ...  Separation allowance is  conlin                     for 26 weeks and tho widow                     supplied with tho requisite foi                     of  application.   Before  sep;                     tion  allowance  ceases  she                     informed  of tho amount  of                     pension and supplied with po                     draffs for claiming it.Other  dependants  As for widows.Disabled   officers  No application necessary.Officers&apos;   widows  Application  should  be  addresse and dependants     in  writing  to  the  Ministry                     Pensions, Groat  George  Sir.

              Separation Allowances.   .AIr. Hogge asked the Secretary of the Local Govern-  aient Board whether he is aware that Local War Pensions  Committees, in administering the Regulation concerning  increased allowances to the dependants of apprentices.  are informing applicants that the increase  is only pay-  able in case of distress ; and whether he will issue an  instruction informing such Committees that it is their  duty to administer the Regulations and not to convert  themselves into relieving officers ?   Mr. Barnes:  The  Statutory Committee  have no  evidence to show  that Local Committees are informing  applicants that the increase under Part II., Regulation 9  tb), is only payable in case of &quot; distress.&quot;  The purpose  uf the Statutory Committee&apos;s Regulations is to obviate  hardship, and the  Regulation in question consequently  restricts  allowances to cases in which it can be  shown that the  absence of the expected contribution from the son 1ms resulted in  hardship.  The Statutory Committee have every reason  to believe that the Local Committees are administering the Regulations sympathetically, and they do not think it advisable to issue such instructions as the hon. Member suggests.   Mr. Hogge : Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that this Regulation was passed in order to put the mothers of apprentices who at the beginning of the War  joined voluntarily in the same  position  as the  mothers of apprentices who waited to be  conscripted,  and had bigger wages and,  therefore, mothers had bigger  allow- ances, and that, as a matter of fact, the Local Pensions I&apos;i &quot;mmittees are net  administering the Regulations on the correct basis, and consequently there are cases of hardship  ?  Mr. Barnes : I was not aware of anything of the kind. I have had something to do with framing the Regulation and I cannot but think that my hon. Friend is in error. The Regulation was  framed for the purpose  of giving the mother of  an apprentice,  where there might  other- wise be hardship, such an amount as might have been expected  the apprentice would give his mother when his lime had expired.  Mr. MacCallum  Scott asked the  Financial  Secretary to the War Office whether, when a claim for separation allowance is rejected by the  Appeals Committee, any information as  to the reason for the rejection is refused ; and, if not, to whom should a request for information &apos; &apos;o addresse/1 ?  Mr. Forster : I am informed that it is not the practice of the Appeals  Committee of which my right hon. Friend &apos; he Member for North St. Pancras is chairman to refuse information as to the reason for the rejection of a claim for dependanfs separation allowance.  Any inquiry for information  should be  addressed  to  the Secretary,Appeals Committee, 119, Victoria Street, S.W. 1.                   Disablement.  Mr. Duncan  Millar asked the Pensions  Minister howmany different Central Committees representing thevarious Local Statutory Sub-Committees have now been iet up in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, respec- tively,  in  connection  with the treatment  of  disabled soldiers ; and how many schemes have now been ap- proved by the Ministry of Pensions and by the Central Committees in each portion of the United Kingdom ?   Sir A.  Griffith-Boscawen :  The Committees referred to in the hon. Members question are Joint Advisory Committees to assist Local Committees in  dealing with the  treatment and  training  of  disabled soldiers  and sailors.   Fourteen of these Committees are contemplated for England, one  or two  for Wales, four for Scotland, and   three  for  Ireland.  Eight   covering  seventeen geographical counties in England have been agreed to at meetings of Local Committees representatives, and the four covering Scotland have been similarly agreed to in that country.  A scheme for one or two Committees for Wales  is  under  discussion,  and some preliminary inquiries have been  made with  regard to the  threeproposed for Ireland.  I  am  communicating with thevarious  Local  Committees  concerned with a  view toexpediting  the formal constitution of the Joint  Com-mittees, so that these may proceed at once with theirwork of making available within  their large areas theschemes  for  treatment  and  training  which  localCommittees have framed and are framing.             Irish Joint Committees.   Arrangements have been made for  the  Minister to visit Ireland in the week commencing the 21st May to preside over meetings for the setting up of Joint Com- mittees  for Treatment and Training.  It  is proposed to have three districts  corresponding  to  the Military Commands with centres  at  Dublin, Belfast and  Cork. This puts the nine counties of Ulster and County Louth in Leinster  together  as  the Northern District.  The Midland District  will include Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, West Meath, King&apos;s County, Queen&apos;s County, Carlow and Longford in  the Province of Leinster and Leitrim, Sligo, Rosscommon, Mayo and Galway in the Province of Connaught.  The  Southern District will comprise Wexford, Kilkenny and Waterford in Leinster and Tipperary, Clare, Limerick,  Cork and  Kerry in Munster.                     -o-                     Circulars.   We quote the following from a letter received from a Military Representative who is also acting as an official of a Local War Pensions Committee :    &quot; If you receive any more complaints regarding the number of circulars  issued, you  should recommend the complainers to change places for  a while with a Recruit- ing  Officer or  a Military Representative.   During the year 1916, 2,449 Army Council Instructions were issued in addition to some hundreds of  War Office letters, andsince 1st January, 1917,  to date, the number  of Army Council Instructions reaches 746, all of which have to bestudied and acted on.  I cannot see  that  the modestnumber of 41 issued by the Statutory Committee sinceJuly, 1916, affords any ground for complaint.&quot;
          Questions  and Answers.                         o    Q. 5. Is an  allowance  under Regulation 7  (1)  (g) issuable  to  the dependant of a boy icho joins for twelve years, seeing that the de-pendant of a man, though entered for long service, is eligible 1   A. The  regulation is restricted to wives and depen- dants of Ordinary Seamen, Able Seamen,  and Stokers 2nd Class,  and the dependant of a  boy is not  eligible while he is of &quot; boys rating.&quot;   Q. 6.- Can an allowance xmder Regulation 7  (1)  (d) be paid to a separated wife receiving dependanVs allowance in virtue of payments made by her husband  before enlisl- ment to comply with a Court Order ?   A. Yes.  If the wife is childless and unable to work an allowance may be given on the basis of  the assessed dependence.  Q. 7. 7s the wife of a Naval Rating, paid  at mercantile rates, eligible for an allowance under Regulation 7  (1) (a), under  the usual conditions  as to income, though  she is ineligible for separation allowance 1  A. Men  paid at mercantile rates  are not sailors for the purpose of the Statutory Committees Regulations, and their wives and  dependants  are not   eligible for grants or allowances under those Regulations.  Q. 8. To secure equal  treatment  for all widows  as regards the  3 gratuity, do the Statutory Committee propose to relax the  conditions of Regulation 13 (c) in order that widoios not  coming within  the provision of the  Royal Warrant, and not having received a grant from the Royal Patriotic  Fund  Corporation,  may receive the Statutory Committee&apos;s grant 1  A. Regulation 13 (e)  was framed to enable  Local Committees to make grants to widows and  dependants in respect of actual expenses, and they have no powerunder  that  Regulation to sanction automatic grants of 3 in all cases.  Q. 9. Will supplementary pensions be revised as from the 4th April in those cases where the Stale pension is increased from that date,  or tcill  they  continue without revision until the period of the award has expired 1  A. In the caso of  widows supplementary pensions are reduced automatically by the Pension  Issuo  Office by  the amount of the increase in  the State pension payable under the new Warrant.  In t he case of disabled men and dependants  the cases are first reconsiders by the Ministry of Pensions, and if an increased awai is made under the Warrant the supplementary pensio is  reduced  correspondingly.  Any  supplement  stii payable after taking into account the increase in U State pension will  be continued for the period of awan subject to adjustment upon the award of an alternate pension under the  Royal Warrant.   Q. 10.-The majority of Convalescent Homes  being a present given up to the Military, it is almost  imposnik for Committees  to  obtain  accommodation  in institution for convalescent discharged soldiers.   May arrangement be made with suitable  Private Homes at the seaside or ch where to &apos;iake cases  certified for convalescent irealma provided the cost docs  not exceed 30s. a week &apos;!   A. There  are a number of approved Convalesceu Homes which frequently liavc vacancies for discharge! soldiers.  If what are called &quot; Private Homes  &quot;  arc i Convalescent Homes with proper supervision  and ivitl a medical man giving regular attendance, the name/ should  be submitted to  the Statutory  Committee fu sanction.   Ordinary  seaside  lodgings  not supervi u either medically or otherwise cannot be used as trail ment centres under Regulation 12 (b).  Q.  11. Where a man discharged partially disabled  &apos; attended by his panel doctor and is pronounced temporary unfit for v:ork and ordered to rest at home for a period whtU under the  panel doctors care, can the proviso to Note 8 A the top of page 30 of Regulation Part 2 be applied, ami  it this  period of rest  under the panel doctor a scheme ./ treatment  requiring  sanction under  the last paragraph (j 12 b before any altoicancc can be made 1  11 is obvioux ii these  cases that the  treatment by  slopping at home cam&quot;&apos;in practice be postponed until the Statutory Commit!&apos; isanction is received.  A. In  the case  of a  discharged disabled  sailor osoldier who is in receipt of a partial disability pension;is temporarily unfit  for  work owing to a  disabilii)attributable  to liis service in the  present war, and ireceiving  the requisite  care and  attention  from Jipanel doctor or some other doctor,  assistance may I&quot;given under Regulation  12 (b), Part 2.  Should  11 ieman&apos;s incapacity continue for more than a month afterthe date of his discharge, the case should be reportedto the Statutory Committee for them to take such actionas they may consider necessary, and, pending the receiptof a reply, Local Committees may continue the allowaw e.
