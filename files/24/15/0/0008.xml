/SECRET.     Id^^              Intelligence  Bureau.                   ALL^^     .     Department  of Information.                                                   D.4.                        Section  D.          Special Memorandum  on Serbian  Internal, Politics.                      (1st  June,  1917.)      (The follov/ing  account  of the  so-oalled  &quot;Black Hand&quot;  in Serbia  and its political role is based  upon information derived from several  independent Serbian and Southern Slav sources.    My main informant stands  outside any party,  but  has  better opportunities than most people of obtaining inside information. As his  main personal interest is to avoid any conflict  betv-een the rival groups, his  views  may  be  taken  as relatively  impartial though he leans towards the  present Serbian government.)      After the assassination of  King Alexander in 1903  the regicide officers organised  themselves  secretly,  in order  to resist  the attempt to  eliminate  them from public  life,  and it is alleged that  a definite secret society  known  as the &quot;Black Hand&quot; gradually came into  existence.   Certain  it is that when the old Radical Party, then  in power, finally complied with the demands of the  British and other governments for  the  removal of the regicides,  the disgraced officers and their friends,  who had already dabbled freely in  politics,  entered into  relations with the opposition.   Their intrigues became  a permanent  element in the political situation: but the radical  government,  especially under Pashitch and Milevanovitch, were  so strong  in the country as to be unassailable.           -      When the Balkan war broke out  the  country had need of every available officer, and some  of the  disgraced  supporter8 of the
\Obrenovitch regime  on the one hand  and  some  of  the  regicidegroup on the other  hand were restored to  their  former  rank inthe army and took their share in the campaign.    Indeed some  ofthe &quot;Black Hand&quot; group distinguished themselves very speciallyduring the two Balkan wars, and their increased prestige en-couraged them to interfere more actively  in  politics.    Theywere among those who  insisted most  upon the  need  for a militarycontrol of the new  territories won  by Serbia from Turkey andwere foremost in urging drastic measures  against  the Bulgarian &apos;propaganda.   The Pashitch Cabinet  on the other hand insistedupon introducing civil administration.    The conflict  betweenthese two points of view was one of the main causes of Serbia&apos;sadministrative failure in Macedonia, and  the hostility of a veryactive section of the military was  probably  one reason why aninferior type of man  found his way  into the  new civil serviceof the occupied provinces.   One of the most active of the groupwas Colonel Damain  Popovitch who, though  not one  of the actualmurderers, v/as very actively concerned  in the conspiracy.    Inthe first Balkan war  he was made Commandant  of  Durazzo after  theSerbain advance to  the sea through  Albania and, having againdistinguished himself in the v/ar against  Bulgaria,  was madeMilitary Governor  of  Macedonia  (with his  headquarters at Skoplje)after the failure  of  the Albanian rising  in  the autumn of 1913.Taking the strictly military view in respect to the populationhe and his friends  tended to come more  and more into conflictwith Pashitch and  the civil government.     From time to  time sensational  stories of the &quot;Black Hand&quot;came before the Serbian public, but its very existence wasstubbornly denied  in  military circles,  and the  national Casinoor officers&apos; club  in  Belgrade is alleged  to  have  been  foundedwith the deliberate object  of serving as  a &quot;blind&quot;  for this
 secret organisation.   In the year preceding the present v/ar the secret activities of the &quot;Black Hand&quot; are believed to have in- creased and to have taken a turn hostile to King Peter, and guards are said to have been increased round the palace in order to prevent the possibility of a military coup d&apos;etat.   Mr. Stoyan Protitch, then still Minister of the Interior in the Pashitch Cabinet and much its strongest member, took the verydrastic step of  suddenly  surrounding the $rational Casino with apolice  force,  seizing its papers, shutting  it up and  dispersingits members.     Early  in  the present war the officers  of the alleged  &quot;BlackHand&quot; group, some of whom are among the ablest  in the whole army,again distinguished themselves greatly  - especially at the battlesof Tser and Rudnik.   The organisation  raised its head again andacquired more  influence round the person of the Voivode Putnikwho, though in supreme command, was in very feeble health.   Their influence was  exercised more and more against the idea of  con-cessions to Bulgaria, and in proportion as  the Pashitch government                                        4and the Skupshtina committed themselves publicly to the idea ofSouthern Slav  national unity these military Jingoes cooled inenthusiasm  towards the policy of liberation in the north andconcentrated upon a narrowly Serbian policy with Macedonia asits pivot.   The Crown Prince, with whom a  number of  the grouphad acquired considerable influence during  the Balkan campaigns (mainly as  the result of their military prowess) thus found him-self borne  in  two directions.   Being cautious and conciliatoryby nature,  but very accessible to national  ideas and  entirelyvron over to the programme, of Southern Slav  unity, he  chafed moreand more under their influence and began to emancipate himselffrom it.    The disaster which overcame Serbia in the  autumn 1915 -
 in which the unconciliatory attitude of the General Staff and the &quot;Black Hand&quot; group behind it fclaye-i a certain part - provided the Crown Prince and Pashitch with a convenient opportunity for purging the Higher Command of these refractory influences. After the retreat, therefore, Putnik and most of his staff were superseded.   General Terzitch,  an energetic officer who never had any dealings with the &quot;Black Hand&quot;, became Minister of War and worked hand in hand with Pashitch.    It is only too probable that party likes and dislikes were allowed free play in all these military changes.     Since the German conquest of Serbia, then, discontent has taken a double form - on the one hand the inevitable dissatis- faction of exiles with a homeless government, and on the other hand a militarised tendency directed against the politicians. The discontented elements in the army inclined more and more to favour the Liberal party, most of whose lee.ders had remained behind in Serbia,  and to blame Pashitch for adopting a purely fantastic and unreasonable policy.    The fact that Serbia madeIan offer of peace which v/as refused by  Pashitch encouraged his[opponents still further in the direction of the narrower SerbianI[solution.    Pamphlets and other  literature full of abuse of the government, the dynasty and the  Crown Prince were printed in Switzerland under the supervision of kr. Yakshitch,  the former editor of the Shtanrpa of Belgrade (a prominent Serbian publicist pith on Austrophile past ana by  no means a high reputation - tojoe carefully distinguished from  his brother,  Mr.  Gregory Yakshitch, pno of the chief exponents of Serbian ideas in Paris).     The pnse of those effusions v/as to  incite  the disaffected officers vo oust Pashitch and the politicians and to take the whole power.. fnto their own hands.    An attempt  was  made to smuggle th;m to
Salonica for distribution in  the  army  but  thoy were seized anda number of officers  were implicate!  in  the  incident.     The attitude  of  the  Crown Prince  towards  these intrigueshad been very reserved  and  discreet.   The- extent  to which hedisapproved was  only  given  away by  the indiscretion of his brother,Prince George, who is absolutely  devoted to  the Crown Prince,regards him as a great  man  and takes  all his political ideas fromhim.   While with  the army  he let fall phrases v/hich were evidentlyhis violent, and  impulsive version of  his brother&apos;s more consideredviews.   It is alleged  that it was  the discovery of thesesentiments on the  pa,rt  of the Crov/n Prince that finally decidedthe malcontents  to action and that  shots were  fired upon themotor-car in which the  Crown  Prince was  travelling.    The resultwas the arrest of  General Popovitch and  a  number of otherprominent officers; as  many as fifty  are believed  to have beenimplicated but the charge of  treason  does  not  appear to have beenpushed against more than  a  dozen.   General  Goykovitch and someother officers were also  implicated but  v/ere drowned in atorpedoed transport some  months ago on their way to Biserta.    Itis claimed that  the compromising  documents on  which the trial wasbased are absolutely  conclusive of  their guilt.     8y informant  summed  up the situation  as the struggle of anarrow military  caste to  maintain an  absolute  control  of theinternal situation -  the  leaders  of that caste realising that theiraims could only  be realised in a  small Serbia,  and not in a bigSouthern Slav State where new democratic and healthier influenceswould swamp them.     He naturally  expressed grave concern  at the possibility ofthe feud being perpetrated,  by undue severity on  the part  of thegovernment, but  was hopeful that  the  death penalty would  be
remitted.   To his mind  on3  of the most regrettable  features inthe whole  affair v/as the fact that some of the  officers  involvestood so very high in their profession.R.S.w\
