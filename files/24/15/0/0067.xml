          PURCHASES BY EUROPEAN ..ALLIES IN THE UNITEDSTATES,OF AMERICA.        (Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions).          I am forwarding herewith, for the informationof the War Cabinet, copies of a Cable No. 45514 receivedon June 4th. from Mr. C.J. Phillips, one Of therepresentatives of the Ministry of Munitions withMr. Balfour, and a copy of a Cable which i suggestshould be sent in reply.          In replying to an earlier Cable on the samesubject from Mr. Phillips, I have already expressed thestrong opinion that the proposed inter-allied Councilshould sit in London and not in Paris, and I have pointedout that no inter-allied Council of this character couldfinally determine requirements and settle allocations ofmaterials to bind the Allies.  Such decisions could onlybe given by the Governments themselves or byplenipotentiaries appointed by them, and plenipotentiariescould not be in constant session.  The agreement nowproposed recognises this fact and leaves the finaldecisions to the Governments concerned .          I think there will probably have to be aquarterly meeting of plenipotentiaries to receive  reportsfrom the inter-allied Council and give the necessarydecisions, but this can,  I think, be left until  theoccasion arises.          Paragraphs/
                         -  2 -          Paragraphs  10 and 11  of Mr.  Phillips1  Cablepresent spme difficulties.   After the  programme  is  settledin London, it would be sufficient if &quot;fche  United  Statesrepresentatives on the Council  communicated it to theUnited States Government and if the representatives ofeach Ally saw that the programme was carried out so faras it concerned that  Ally,  but  it may  help the unitedStates to feel that there is an inter-allied body inWashington to which they can refer, and on the wholeit may be better to agree,  though I foresee that ourrepresentative in the United States may be hamperedsomewhat by the delays inherent in a Committee.                         (Sgd.)   C. ADDISON.                                          7.6.17.P.S. 2?he proposal is  submitted  to the  War Cabinet forconsideration as it affects not merely purchases madein the united States  by the Ministry of Munitions,but presumably also any whioh may be made by theWar Office, Admiralty or any other Department.
