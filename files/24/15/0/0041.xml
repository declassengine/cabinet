SECRET1793AR CABINET.G.T.941.FIXING HF PRISES FOR THIS SEASON13 FBUIT.(Memorandum by Lord Derby)      I am sorry to bother the War Cabinet with what mayseem to be a natter of small importance, but I am obliged toask them for a decision as to the fixing of a price for thisseason&apos;s fruit.   It is essential we should have all thatwe require for the provision of jam for the troops, and at.the present moment, with no price fixed at which we can buy,the fruit prices are soaring higher and higher, and owingto the warm weather the fruit crop is likely to be earlierthan usual.      Mr.TTeir estimates that already, owing to the non-fixingof prices, we have lost  250,000, as we have been obligedto buy at&apos;an inflated price, and this amount will be verylargely increased unless immediate steps are taken.      I enclose a memorandum by Mr.Weir which explainsthe whole position.      The War Office has,  during the War, bought its suppliesof jam through a Committee of jam makers.  This Committeedoes not include the whole of the jam makers, and there is,consequently, competition for the fruit with the outsidemakers.   It ia, of course, not known what the season&apos;o produceof various kinds of fruits will be,  and, consequently,  thereis room for speculation on the part  of buyers.      If the War Office commandeered the quantity it requiredfor its contraotors and paid such rates as might seem to begood,  the speculation with regard to the residua of the cropswould probably become very acute.   Those whose fruit wascommandeered would probably feel great dissatisfaction thatthe price they received was lower than the price at whichother fruit farmers had sold.   To avoid this difficulty itwould probably be necessary to commandeer the whole crop; theGovernment taking what it  required and selling the remainder.      Fruit traders (those of them who are represented  onthe War Office Committee)  consider that the best course ia tofix the price of the fruit.   This was their recommendationto Lord Devonport on April 5th,  1917.(Signed)   DERBY.War Office.   5.6.17.S.  of S.FRUIT  AND  JAM.
 an May 4th the Food Controller came  to  the conclusion that it ---fas not desirable, at any rate  then,  to  fix  the maximum prices.    As a consequence, the  &quot;.ar  Office buyers have been buying a certain quantity of frait, and have, in order to secure some supplies,  ( the independent fruit merchants having already entered  the market) paid for these supplies a higher rate than the rates  which they recommended ag the maximum rates in April 1917. The result has been that the producers  ore playing off the independent buyers against the War  Office- buyers, and it is feared that the prices of  the fruit will soar even higher than the level the prices have already reached.       The average price of the fruit naturally  varies agood deal with the 3oason&apos;s crops; and  thcrb  is  reason to anticipate that the crop this year will be at least as good as the crop last year, although there may be some greater difficulty in labour.       The prices proposed by the &quot;ar Office buyers to theFood Controller in April -*ere as follows.-De criptionof Fruit.(1)Strawberries)off stalk,  JGoosberries )green or red)English Black)Currants     )RaspberriesPrices proposedon April 5/17  Per Ton.

The prices shown are the pricesfree on rail.       If the principle is approved, tho order fixing themaximum price should include certain details not necessaryto be dealt with in this memorandum.gar Office, 5th June.1917.
