I appendtwo sets of questions which I addressed to them end theirreplies.4th June, 1917.                        .    (Intld.) C. of K.                              I.      When the House of Commons meet again questions willbe asked whether we are gcii^g to do anything and if so whatin return for the raid on Folkestone and for the sinking cfthe hospital ship &quot;lover Castle.&quot;      Reprisals on unfortified towns are unpopular andapparently futile.   what the War Cabinet want to know is      1, What places are there (of military character         or value) across the German frontier that we         could attack from the Air?      8. Have we now the machines and the pilots to do         it at Luxnuil or elsewhere?      3. Would the French do it if we did not?                              I.                                              AIR BOARD OFFICE,                                                  Strand, .7.0./2                                x               31et May,1917Beai lord Curson,                              t      A Meeting was held this afternoon at the Air Board underlord CowdrayJs presidency to consider the three questions*ith reference to reprisals which you asked in your letior ofyesterday1s date.   In case you have no copy,  I enclose astatement of the questions.      I am desired by lord Cowdray to reply as follows      As regards Question 1, here 5s a list of places ofMilitary character or value  whioh can be reaehsd from theFrench lines with a chance of the pilot being able to return :-                       1 *  Mamhe im                       2. Strasaburg                       3. Saarbiucken.      At Mannheim there are some extremely important chemicalworks.
      The answer to the second question is in the negative.We have no machines or pilots at loxeuil and none are availableelsewhero without diversion from their present employment.      As to Question 3, the French might be able to undertakereprisal raids a short distanca across the German frontier,but could probably not reach, or/effect serious damage in any placeof Military importance in German territory.   It is believedthat they have neither suitable bombing machines nor the escortsnecessary for the purpose.      It must be remembered that any reprisals undertaken byus from the Allied lines hava to cross the German linos and aregion occupied by their fighting air forces.   Consequentlyour bombing aeroplanes are always liable to serious afctaskand warnings can be sent to the threatened objectives in plentyof time.      Haids, on the other hand, undertaken by the Germaneagainst us are not exposed bo this disadvantage as they are madeacross the sea.      looking at the question from a somewhat differentpoint of view you will no do*ubt bear in mini that the H.N.A.S.and the H.F:.C* have during the last six .vee&apos;:rs bean continuouslybombing Zeebruggo and places behind the German linen wheneverweather permitted.   A great quantity of bombs have beendropped and tha damage done has been sorious.   It would notbe at all unreasonable to look upon the German raid onFolkestone as a retort to our own bombing activities.                                       (SgdJ H.P.HAEVE/                                  II.                               QUE3TIOJ1TS.1. Are air stations on the S. and 3*EU  coast equipped with the   latest pattoms cf listening apparatus  for the detection   and looal&amp;on of hostile&apos;aircraft,  eeg.  the new 2E&amp;HIH   French listeners?   And was any listening apparatus actually   in use?2. Were the anti-aircraft guns furnished with tracer-shrapnel   shells, as,  e.gu the OOSO typo, of which Woolwich has had   samples for  some time?3. The enemy craft are stated to have been &quot;flying at a great   heights&quot;  tfere heigh -finders (of which a large number have   been made) in use?   jtf so, when,  and what was the actual   height recorded?      There aro a certain number of other places of a sitsH&amp;r character, not included in the above list, in Allied territory occupied by the Germans &amp;uch as longwy (which contains a&quot;number of blast furnaces).      There are no places of the kind you indicate within a reasonable distance of the British line3.      To reach Germany by ?ray of the sea would require a Naval Expedition.
4. Have the  unexploded bcmbs been found&quot; to  contain the new &apos; hydrocarbon -MO,  - explosive, hncw  in  France as  T&apos; nilite&quot;  &apos;or &quot;Panelostit&amp;?n   And  are  our aircraft supplied  with   this (which alone  i3 used by the French) and  of which full   details have been  furnished  to the Monitions  Inventions   Dept.?II oMinute by General Shaw1, Uo Military air stations in this  country are  equipped with   listening apparatus.         Many have been experimented with by the Munitions   Inventions Department,  but  it  is  understood that  none have   been as yet found satisfactory.2. Shell is fitted with &quot;night tracers&quot; but not  rrday tracers.,&quot;         The latter have not been found satisfactory and their   employment necessitates the use  of a large amount of s$aee   which might be filled with  shrapnel bullets .    The &quot;Otto&quot;   type has never been heard of here,3. Height finder s v/ere used at  Dover  which was the only gun   station fitted with these instruments, over which the ear-   craft passed.   They are intended for use against Seppelino   and although they are also  effective when used against   single or small numbers of  aeroplanes, they are liable to   great error when used against  aeroplanes flying in formation   and in considerable: numbers as on tho last occasion.         The results v/ere  raasatisfactcry and the reason is, as   will be easily understood,  that with so mamy  similar objects   range upon all travelling at a great paco, the difficulty  of   getting observers f milo apart to suloct tho  same object is   almost insuperable,.4. The unexploded bombs ere how being; dug up and collected.   They will be sent to Woolwich  for analysis, but it has not   yet been possible to do ma      Sir DcHenderson further reports as r ogards Questionji:-      We use Aoatol for bombs.   Anilito is not used because   1* There is no apparent improvement in effect;   2. Anilite bombs can only be used from a considerable height   3.  The use of anilite would require an alteration in our      bomb designo      It is probably used by tho French because it became avail^able just about the time they began  in use special aeroplanebombs.      The E.NcAoS. have used Auilito bombs but are giving themup.
