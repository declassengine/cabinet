FIw/001      WEEKLY REPORT OH  ITALY. I.            June 1., 1917.     Italy has of late  had its mind set first on expectation ofthe great advance, and  later on watching its success.   Thepolitical situation presents few or no features of importance.On the whole it has improved.   At least an utterance  of Turati&apos;sseems to  indicate that, in consequence of the Russian  revolutionand the entry  of the United States into the War, the officialSocialist party will abandon the attitude it has hitherto adoptedof opposing the war and contesting every vote of confidence inParliament.    Moreover  the attacks on Sonnino are subsiding andthe results of the conference of 3t. Jean de Maurienne, so faras they are known, give satisfaction.   And though influentialvoices,  such as that of the journalist who signs himself&quot;Rastignac&apos;, loudly proclaim that the war is for Italy an Italianwar for an Italian map, not a democratic war for a democraticmap,  and though in all  parties, even the least Imperialist, strongminorities at  least, as was shown at the recent Reformist SocialistCongress, take the Nationalist view of the problem of  Dalmatia, yeteven on that difficult  question there is a feeling which has beenexpressed by Signor Labriola that the Russian renunciation of-Constantinople opens the way for Italy to be less nervous aboutSlavism and, as he said, to &quot;consider the Dalmatian problem morecoolly1.   Parliament is going to meet again in June and probablythere will be  some mild attacks on the Government.   But theseare not likely to come  to anything.   The country is politically
calm and the  Government  was  so  decidedly victorious over itscritics in the  April  session when its explanations of its actionswere almost universally  aooepted throughout the country, that nocrisis  is at  all  likely  to arise out of anything at present knownto the  Italian  public.   Whether Sonnino&apos;s irritation at Italianexclusion from  the Paris Conference,  and his feeling that hisposition with his colleagues in the  Cabinet has been rendereddifficult,  will lead  to  further results,  it is impossible tosay.J.B.
