 SECRET &quot;                         WAR  CABINET. G.T. 989                     ITALY  AKD  ASIA  MINOR.     (Letter from the C.I.G.S. to Lord Hardinge of Penshurst) Lord H^rdin^e.          The condition that Italy should make an increased effort to co-operate with the Allies was inserted before the recent offensive on the Iscnso,   I am of opinion that she has done all that could he expected from her for the time being, and that she has been successful in inflicting loss upon the Austrian Army.    Her success has been recognised by the War Cabinet  who, at their 147th Meeting,  directed that telegrams of congratulation should be despatched to the Italian G-vern- ment and to the Italian Minister of War.   I am informed that General  Cadorna proposes to continue his endeavours to cause the greatest possible injury to the Austrian forces on the Italian  Front compatible with the resources at his disposal. In these circumstances I do not see that we can at present ask Italy to do more,,  as it is  on her own frontiers and not in other theatres  that her effort can be exerted  to the best advantage.         With  regard to the Italian proposal  to send 6,000men to Palestine,  the experience of the war fully  proves thatnixed forces are very objectionable owing to the inherentdifficulties of command and supply.   They also seem to giverise to  political friction.         The French are sending to Palestine  only threebattalions  which with auxiliary services amount to approxi-mately 3,000 men,  and I consider that the Italian  contingent should in no circumstances  exceed that strength and mightadvantageously  be smaller,                               (Intd.)   W.R.R.                                              rt t  n  a                                              *j . J. .17 . p.June 5th, 1917.
