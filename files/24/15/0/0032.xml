WAR  CABINET.C RS TTIMBERB/EPOBTATION.Kote by Lord Curzon.     At the War Cabinet on &amp;ay :50th during the discussionon the priority of claims on Shipping, it was statedinter alia, that :-     (l)  There would probably be juBt enough tonnage         available in June to bring to thi3 country the         total volume of imports of all hinds needed in         that month.   This result, however, was only         made possible by severe curtailment of require-         ments on the part of the Departments, by         reducing the shipments of munitions from the         U.3.A. by some 200^000 tons,  and by the total         elimination of timber during that month.     (2)  For July the outlook was more serious, because         it was estimated that tho demands of the         Departments upon tonnage would exceed the supply         by somo 563,000 tons.   In this month,  notwith-         standing the fact that no timber had been allowed    for/June,  there appeared figures for timber    amounting to 163,000 tons, and in August 153,000    tons.These figures  seemed to call for some explanationfrom my Committee on Timber Supplies, which had beenspecially appointed to deal with the question.   Ouraction had been as fellows :-in
(2)     On April 25th (War Cabinet 125, Minute 12  (a)),the War Cabinet decided that after the discharge oftimber cargoes then loaded or loading, no further timber3hould be shipped until the sanction of the 7ar Cabinethad been obtained.     On May 7th (r?ar Cabinet 133, Minute 7) in view ofinformation supplier! by the President of the Board of-Trade indicating that there was a prospect of a timberfamine in a few months, a Coumrittee was appointed undermy Chairmanship to examine the situation.     My Coromittee heard the evidence of the Departmentsconcerned, and examined the difficulties in connectionwith the Home Grown Timber Supply caused by shortage ofLabour, Sawmills, and Traction facilities.     As a result of this inquiry, the Minutes of whichare on record at 2 VThitehall Gardens, my Committee cameto the conclusion that it v/as impossible absolutely toprohibit the importation of timber.   In this view theywere particularly influenced by the evidence of theController of Mines,  who said that tho C&amp;llieries inSouth Wale3, upon which the Havy depended for Supplies,would be brought to a standstill unless some Pitwoodwere imported.     Hy Committee at once took steps, by the provisionof labour and haulage, for the development of localtimber supplies in the woodlands of South *ftle3 andadjacent counties.     In-as-much, however, as some time must necessarilyelapse before anything like the 40,000 tons a month ofpit-props (i.e. half the total monthly requirements ofSouth Wales) could be delivered, it was necessary forsome degree of importation to continue in order to preventthe mine3 from coming to a standstill.

     So far as these imports would come from Scandinavia,we laid down as an essential condition that the neutralvessels destined to bring the timber would not, In  anycase,. displace cargoes of food stuffs or munitions.     The total import of pitv/ood from France and Portugalto make up the 80,000 per month was as 70,000  tons  inJuly and 60,000 in August, after which it will fall  at therate of io,000 per month to 40,000 in October, when  itwill remain constant at that figure, the balance ox  the80,000 being by that time supjjlied by home production.     As regards the demands of the other Departments,  wefound that the irreducible minimum of these during  theensuing months was as follows :-     If these figures be added to the 70,000 tons ofPi Wood in July and 60,000 do. in August, they con-stitute the 163,000 tons in Juiy, and the 153,000 inAugust to which Sir Leo Chiozza Money referred.2 Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.     5th Juno, 1917.Some reduction must be made in these figures on account of the closing of the works at Fenbury, which ha3 taken place since these estimates were submitted.JulyTonsAugust.
