PERSONAL AND SECRET.DE LA GUERRE,REPUBLIOUE FRANCAISE.L.S.14.31st May, 1917.Dear General,       Monsieur Jonnart is going to be accompaniedto Athens by Lt.-Cclonel Georges who was Sub-chief ofStaff at Salonika; he is a very brilliant officer andgot on well, I am told, with the British, but hisnatural tendency will certainly be to advocate theemployment of farce rather than pacific methods.   Itwas he who prepared practically all the documents onwhich the French based their arguments -for thesimultaneous invasion of Thcssaly and landing on the                                    rIsthmus of Corinth.       Of course, I suppose Monsieur Jonnart is toobig a man to allow himself to be influenced by asubordinate, but still as Colonel Georges has greatexperience of Salonika I imagine his opinion willcarry a certain amount of weight.                   Yours sincerely,                      (Signed)  E.L. Spiers.Major-General F.B,Maurice, C.B..     Director of Military Operations,           WAR OFFICE,                LONDON, S.W.I.
1st June 1917.To Major Pagalde.VKRY SECRET.    M. Painleve has sent the following instructionsto General Sarrail      The first part contains the terms of the Convention ofLondon.      The second part announces (the mission of) M.Jonnart anddefines his powers.  It orders the taking of immediate measuresfor controlling the Thessalian crop as soon as the order there-on shall be given according to instructions already telegraphedon the 7th May.  These instructions must be particularly ad-hored to with regard to Venizelist intervention which must beof a conciliatory character.  M.Jonnart must try to purchasethe harvest.       Prepare immediately troops to disembark in Attica ifnecessary.   England consents to the participation of a nominalcontingent  in this expedition if it takes place.       If the King sets afoot any movement of troops to resistthe Allies  disembarkation will take place in the Isthmus ofCorinth.       General Sarrail should inform us if he thinks it neees-sary to send  troops into Thessaly immediately or whether it ispreferable  -  as H.Painleve thinks - to wait until the Atticaexpeditionary corps is ready.       M. Jonnart will be at Athens on the 3rd of June and willfix the date  of operations.   General Sarrail should  telegraph ifhe thinks that this should take place earlier.Spiers
