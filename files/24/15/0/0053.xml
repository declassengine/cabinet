E C R t T., .^irom    Lt-Colonel Blair10GPetrograd.    5th june, 191?&apos;.1146.     General impression exists that the labour troubleswill come to a head here this week.   However the staff  ofdistrict have no information of any general repudiation  yet.          Yesterday :/r.Kerenski returned from south-west front,but 1 have not been able to see him,  so I do not yet know hispersonal views as to possibility of an offensive.   To-day heleaves for northern front.   I was told to-day that hisinfluence is only temporary,  though his reception was veryenthusiastic.          The Bolsheviki whose powers have increased latelyare carrying on very agitation amongst troops of Petrogradgarrison, undoubtedly financed by Germany.   It ia hoped thatsome evidence of this may shortly be forthcoming, when actioncould be taken against them.          The influence of the Council has diminished sincethe inclusion of members of the Council of Working-men andSoldiers Deputies in the Government,  and they know this.By throwing in their lot with the *Bolsheviki,  they couldregain some influence, but every endeavour is being made toprevent this.   A suggestion is being put forward thatLieut JCozmin should be elected in  Mr.Chernovs place on  theCouncil which would bring the Council into close touch withthe garrison.   To-morrow, there is to be a meeting of theCouncil, at which General Polovtsev and Lieut JCozmin areto be present.   At a meeting to-day of representatives  of41 units of Petrograd garrison, it was unanimously decidedto take steps to deal with disorder caused by soldiers on therailways.   Staff of district say discipline here is muchbetter and more work is being done; but how much reliancecould be placed on any particular unit in case of necessity,        is not  yet known.he Extremists.
