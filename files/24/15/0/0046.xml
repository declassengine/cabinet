GQMIWSIAL.PAHT  I,            The neea for a decision this year.     There are two alternatives which present themselvesfor consideration in the conduct of the war and  they mayhe briefly summed up as follows:-     1*   To continue to subject the enemy to an unceasingbombardment with occasional attacks so as to force him tocontinually organise new lines and to prevent him recallinglarge numbers of men for submarine building, agriculturalpursuits, etc, anc await the arrival of decisive numericalsuperiority in the shape of a very large expeditionaryforce from the United States.     2.   To continue the offensive in France on the presentscale right through the Summer, Autumn and early &quot;interwith the determination to cause the enemy to use up allhis reserves and force him to withdraw to the Rhine beforethe  inter, and thus liberate France and Belgium with aview to a satisfactory peace.     The arguments for and against may be briefly summedup as follows:-     It is urged by some that by adopting the firstalternative     (a)   You will save &quot;unnecessary slaughter&quot; and thatit is no good beating against a hitherto unshaken wallwithout far greater superiority in men.     (b)   That by conserving your energy for the decisiveblow with great numerical superiority you will stand a fargreater chance of decisive victory.     My repLies to these contentions are as follows     (a)   That to obtain such an overwhelming superiority
it is unlikely that the Army of the United States of say1,500,000 men can be trained and conveyed to the &quot;esternfront until May 1918 at the earliest.     fb)   That the British and French casualties,  in thenormal wastage of war during this waiting period and thoseincurred, if any semblance of offensive dofence is  to bekept up, will be at least a million men,     fe)  That ?;hen the United States Armies arrive theBritish and French Armies will not be able to remain spec- tators and will both have to take a large part in the jointoffensive involving very great casualties, probably notless than 1,000,000 apart from those incurred by the UnitedStates,     (d9   That the position of Russia is critical  and thelonger the war continues the greater probability there isthat Russia will drop out.  The only wise course then isto endv avour by every possible means to break the GermanMilitary machine whilst the seventy odd German Divisionsare kept on the Eastern front.     (e)   The German Divisions on the Eastern frontapproximate to the probable contribution of the United Statesby May 1918;  therefore a tensive policy may entirely destroythe very gxssfc superiority its advocates hope to achieve bydelay.     (f)   Any relaxation will give the enemy time  to organiseseveral Hindenburg lines.     (g)   If the man-power of the United States in conjunc-tion with the Entente Armies will be decisive in May 1918how much more will it be decisive if our offensive  continuesthroughout the year even though &quot;the slaughter is equal&quot;?
(h)  The submarine menace may not improve with time nndtransportation of the American Army may be most hazardous,whilst to supply an American Army of 2,00Q0COmen wouldrequire probably four or five times as much shipping as isnow engtged in supplying the British Expeditionary Force atSalonika, and if so absorb all the additional shipping whichAmerica&apos;s entry into the war provides.     (i)  France&apos;s manpower is exhausted and her morale mustsuffer from another Winter.     The foregoing arguments may be summed up as follows     To wait for the United States and then fight will costthe Empire and France probably 2,000,000 men.     To fight to win this year will probnbly cost the TSrapireand France 1,200,000 men.     The difference in the cost between a decision inSeptember 1917 and August 1918 will be anything up to 2,000,000,000.     It is possible to win this year whilst Russia is etillin, but if we wait and Russia drops out we are back againat equal man-power, in spite of the United States.     Russia is more likely to stay in if we are attackingthan if we are on the defensive.     If the pressure of the Vest em front is kept up themere threat of the United States Army will probably persuadeGermany to make terms before Winter.     If  e relax the offensive German morale will improveand the American threat will be accordingly less powerfulin its influence.     Owing to submarines the BV/ait and see&quot; policy may notbe possible in the end.
     From  every point of view then  t is desirable to tryand reach  a decision in 1917.
                  -  5-                                 .197                  PART  II.    Reorganization of Man-pover in the British Armies to       provide the necessary drafts to obtain decisive       victory in 1917*It is submitted    (l)   That the total man-power in uniform in the United Kir          dom is far in  excess of any requirements for re-          pell ir.g a  raid or raids if organized with a view          to economy of  men.    (2)   That the present organization is cumbrous, wasteful,          and can be well improved so as to provide greater          efficiency for defence and far greater supply          of men for the armies on active service.    With regard to the first proposition I suggest that ifthe British man-power in uniform, other than men in hospitalsand convalescent camps,  be totalled, a figure will be reachedwhich is four times  that necessary to&quot;repel any possible  raid.                                     *    By reorganizing                                    0          The Home Defence Force.          The Garrison Defence Force.          Provisional Units.          Drafting Units and Depots.          Volunteers.    I estimate that, excluding men convalescent end inhospital, there are  still men available for defence numberingbetween 1,900,000 and 2,050,000.  (Including Volunteers andDominion troops.)    I further estimate that, omitting men employed on admin-is trative duty, there are 1,700,000 men who could be includedin the first and second  line of the Home Defence Force.
     If this calculation is anything near the mark then it isclear that there are at least three quarters of a million menwho can he freed for the following purposes :-     (l)  Supplying extra division and drafts for France.     (2)  Replacing A men in administrative positions in            England and France and otheiybehind the lines or            on lines of communication.     (3)  If unfit to fight to replace fit men at present            engaged in essential industries.     To free this very large number of men the followingproposals for drastic reorganisation are offered.(A)  TO abandon the present G-.H.Q,. Home Forces and thusliberate the whole of the duplicate administration which isat present a costly encumbrance for which there appears tobe no necessity,     To put the command of the Home Defences directly underthe .far Office, with or without the Commander-in-Chiefincluded in the War Office authority.     At present the waste of energy, material and time in-curred by the overlapping of the triple authorities of theArmy Commands, G.H.Q,. Home Forees and the War Office cannot bejustified and ought to be ended forthwith.(B)  All drafting units as opposed to training units (see PartIII) should be moved to vulnerable positions where they wouldcome under the command of the Northern and Eastern Commandswith a definite place in the defensive scheme, thus fulfillingthe dual role of drafting and defensive units as is the casewith certain special Reserve-, units today.   In this manner thedefence force will be increased by some 500,000 men, thusfreeing 500.000 men at present engaged on home defence forthe purposes mentioned at the commencement of this page.(C)  To equip, arm and organize the volunteers as the second
line of defence to be immediately mobilised  on  the first  alarmand to have a definite role in the  defence with complete  organi-sation.     To make the parades of Volunteers  compulsory.(D)  To weed out all A and B Officers and men from Administrationin the United Kingdom and replace them  by old men, invalidedofficers and men, women, etc.     To replace all motor drivers by C  Class men or women, thusfreeing men from this branch of the service  for France.     To replace all fit  A men  in the R.A.K.C. by C men, old menand young women.(E)  TO comb every A man at present engaged  as  officers&apos;  servantsand grooms on all Staffs superior to Brigade Staffs in France;to reduce Staff horses by 50^,  to replace the servants and groomsby C men at present in England.     Ry these means the offensive army&apos;  in France can be increasedby 750,000 men, whilst at the  same  time strengthening the HomeDefence Force by improvement of disposition.     Note on Defence of the United  Kingdom.          The War has proved that without heavy  artillery notrenches can be captured.   I  submit that an enemy raid to besuccessful must be very rapidly carried out, and that it isinconceivable that the enemy could  land heavy gums with suchrapidity as would give him the remotest chance  of success.     Put in another way:  to land heavy guns would give time forthe whole Defence force and Volunteers  to concentrate at thethreatened point or points.
PAKT  III..THE SAVING OF MAN-POWER OK ACTIVE SERVICE.     The normal casualties of  the British Array  are from  30to 50 per cent  higher than need  be the  case if  the question isthoroughly dealt with,  and this  is due  to -     (l)  Lack  of advanced training for British Troops priorto proceeding to the seat  of war.     (2)  The fact that the Higher Bommand ,do not make it theirbusiness to demand an explanation for losses sustained by theirunits.     With regard to the question of avanced training, in thefirst place,  drafts going  to France are inadequately  trainedin trench discipline with  the  result that I believe isinvariable, namely, that the percentage of casualties amongstnewly arrived drafts is far higher than amongst trained  men.In the second place, whereas preliminary training may be  regardedas extremely good and thorough,  very large numbers of troopshave proceeded  to France without even most elementary trainingin open warfare,  in consolidation,  in relieving at night andin sitting and digging a new trench in  the dark.     All these criticisms equally apply to young officers, andit is especially  noticeable  that lateral  communication betweenbrigades and divisions is very  much neglected  as part of thetraining, whilst  officers and non-commissioned officers fre-quently show great ignorance of taking  compass bearings, recog-nising objectives, and such  matters as  vitally affect thesuccess or failure of an operation.     I therefore  suggest that whereas in  many  training unitsyou find partially trained men  working  with raw recruits theres can only
preliminary training separated from those units which,  inPart II of the Memorandum, I describe as drafting units tofulfil the dual role of drafting and defensive purposes.     Even if units have to be moved occasionally for trainingpurposes to  big spaces like Salisbury Plain,  the expenses wouldbe negligible compared to the advantages gained by advancedtraining.     With regard to the desirability of fixing the responnibilityfor casualties in the field,  I suggest for serious considerationthat whenever the normal casualties of a battalion,  brigadeor division in the trenches  are high, an enquiry should  beinvariably  made into the cause,  and an explanation rendered.     The writer holds strong views on this subject because inhis battalion the trench casualties were always about bO%less than in any other unit  in the same Division,  and as aBrigade Commander, by applying the same rules  to trenchdiscipline,  the trench casualties  were also  reduced  by  onehalf.  This  result was arrived at  in the following manner.     Every  day a return was  sent to Headquarters by  which thecause of any casualty was shown thus:-     Private Brown,  C. Company,  killed:   bullet  wound in        head (rifle).     Corporal Johnson, D. Company,  wounded in  arm,  (mortar        bomb).     Private Jones,  A. Company,  wounded in leg,  (rifle grenade).     Sergeant Brown, Privates Toms,  James, Wrag,  Forbes  and        Barton, all  of B. Company,  wounded,  (H.E,  Shell)     As a result of this report  enquiry would  be immediatelymade for an explanation of the first casualty,  and of thelast group  of casualties, and in the first case if thebullet wound occurred whilst on sentry or patrol work atnight the explanation was considered satisfactory.    If  itoccurred by day it proved either than the man  was lookingover the parapet or else that the  defences were  inadequate.
 In  either case a Company and Platoon Commander were held responsible for failure in trench discipline.     In the case of the group of men wounded by .a high explosive shell, if they were all wounded by the same shell it  stands to reason that the trench was crowded,  and that my invariable rule that there should not be more than four men in  any one bay had been broken.   And in this case again the officers in charge on the spot were held responsible for failure in trench discipline.     Again, if any man was wounded whilst walking in the open when he might have been using the trench, this is a question of  discipline.  It especially applies to officers,  who ought to  be compelled, whatever the weather conditions,  to use the trenches and not to take short cut3 across country,  thereby setting a bad example to all ranks.     If steps were taken to make an examination of  casualties it would very soon be found that there were certain  averages of  casualties for each sector of the line,  and if the casualties exceeded that average General Officers  shouldhave to show the reason why in their Commando the  averagewas exceeded.     However valuable this principle may be with  regard totrench warfare,  it  is equally essential  with regard  to operations in the attack and in defence.     In the attack frequently the objective is not gained andheavy casualties are incurred.     Provided the casualties are heavy it  is taken forgranted that the unit has made a great effort.    But here again an explanation should be required  from the officer responsible, and in purely local operations where one brigade or  one battalion is taking part  the Commanding Officer should be  encouraged to say if,  owing to failure  of the bombardment,
    o^ougwi ui -tne enemy wire, or ^aueh other local conditionin his opinion the objective cannot he gained.  He ourrhtto he punished for failing to give such reason whilst hestill hud the opportunity.      Brigadiers and Commanding Officers at present hesitututo express such an opinion as it ia regarded as contrary tothe spirit of the service.      With regard to defence in big operations uuoh us thoseexisting on the SOJUftO or at Arras, a comparatively narrowobjective is usually allotted,   Thus a division say beadvancing on or defending a frontage of a thousand yards..HOYS it is perfectly obvious that with a thousand yard frontheld by two battalions it ia quite adequate if there aretwo battalions in eld so b&quot;apport sith one battalion in reserve.In spite, however, of this elementary truth, tho writer hasKnown of cases of a franfcage of a thousand yards beingiafended &amp;ith the -vhoio of the division, in various lines,all in front of the British guns and liable to heavycasualties from shelling.   The netrecult of this over-eatTtion on the part of Divisional General is involves firstthat the supporting and reserve battalions in the frontsystem were eo crowded that very heavy casualties wereincurred, and the supporting and reserve brigades orbattalions were shelled und nevsr got any re&amp;t at ail inspite of the fact that it was known that they would berequired for operations in the immediate future.      The question of giving adequate reat to troops who maybe required for the offensive ia of vital importance, ana ioonly appreciated properly by those who have been RegimentalOfficers for some length of time during an offensive.  In thecases on the Sorariie to which I allude, frequently the reservebrigade was told to rest immediately in front of the Britishguns.  The result was no rest at all, arid the constant know-
 ledge that the enemy&apos;s artillery might be searching for our guns, and the incessant noise of our own artillery, rendered any kind of rest quite impossible.     How in a case like this surely it would have been wise with troops of the division more thick on the ground than is ever dreamt of in the ordinary defence of the line, to have had one battalion of the reserve brigade jn3t behind our guns ready to reinforce if necessary, ond the other three battalions at least a mile behind where they could rest apart from the noise.     The Higher Commands do not appear to have really grasped the mental effect cf keeping troops in the shell zone after they have taken part in an offensive, and it has only recently come to the anowledge of the writer that the same policy has been adopted in the present operations.     It ought to be clear to anyone who has made a study of the mental and physical conditions of modern war teat troopswhich have been through the attack,  if they are going to do justice to their fighting powers in   further attack,  must be taken completely out of the shell zone;  that in fact notroops can possibly do themselves justice in other circumstances.     It is also most noticeable that whereas rest is  essentialthe recovery of troops  ho are  out of the shell  zone  is  atleast a hundred per cent,  quicker than if resting in  theshell zone itself.    In fact,  I go as far as to  say thatno troops will ever do  themselves credit,  and this especially applies to officers,  if they are  as^ed to  attack after anyprolonged stay within the  shell zone where  either our  own or the enemy&apos;s artillery are active.                                                 be     If this fact is  realised instructions  should/immediately issued to put an end to a  system  which is  diBastrouB to  the fighting value of the Army,  and if in futuretllis//
this extremely ignorant policy is adopted, then the GeneralOfficers responsible ought to be immediately relieved ofthe ir commands.     If the principles suggested in Part III. of thisMemorandum are adopted, I believe that the casualties forthe year would be lowered by one half, and the resultsobtained in offensive operations would be increased ineffectiveness by at least 50 per cent.     Divisions which have taken part in an offensive arefrequently taken out and sent to hold a quieter line oftrenches which is considered rest,  and they are then takenback to the offensive,     Ho Division can recover its clan under such treatmentand I earnestly recommend the immediate formation of Divisionsof older and less fit men to hold the quiet parts of thefront as defensive troops and thus give the storming troopsthe opportunity of recovery,            is     If this/adopted an amazing difference would beevident but unless it is the latter stages of the offensivewill^e carried on by stale troops &quot;ho are quite unfit tofight.   Results will get steadily worse and morale will beseriously affected.
