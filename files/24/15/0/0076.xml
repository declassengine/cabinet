Work  of Agricultural Executive Committees,          The  following are illustrations of action reported  byExecutive Committees during the past  week.Birmingham *  Fifty members of the City  Police Force withagricultural experience have been placed on farms in the  area ofthe city and in  the adjoining counties.Cornwall *  The Committee with the sanction of the Department  aretaking possession of the greater portion of Newlyn Downs  aboutsix miles inland from Newquay.Essex.  The Committee have taken possession of a farm of  17tacres at West  Hanningfield.   They are  also about to takepossession of  a  farm of 250 acres at  Rayleigh, and another of200 acres at Woodham Ferris.   These  lands are selected portionsof an area of  about 20,000 acres in South-East Essex which wentout of cultivation in the  &quot;eighties and became the subject ofspeculation for  building purposes.    Practically the wholearea has been  left derelict since that  time.Leicestershire *   The Executive Committee have been authorisedto take possession of 28i acres, part of a farm at Higham-on-the-Hill, and  propose letting to another tenant immediately.Suffolk, East.-  The Committee have decided to take possessionof farms at Bacton, Burgh, Grundisburgh and Peasenhall.
Sussex, East.- The Executive Committee have taken possession ofa farm at Burwash and are letting it,Warwickshire.- The Committee are about to take possession of200 acres of land at Drayton which requires reclamation byclearing bushes etc., and propose to employ prisoners cf warfor the purpose.Anglesey.- The -Committee propose to take possession of a 27acre field at Llanidan now let by the year for grazing, and tolet it to the grazing tenant for cultivation.                      Drainage of Lands.          The Committees are taking further action under theDrainage of Lands Orders.   In West Suffolk the Committee aredealing with the drainage into the River Lark from Mildenhallto Bury St. Edmunds, and are issuing directions to the ownersof mills on this stretch of river to keep their sluices openfrom 6 p.m. on Saturday to 6 p.m. on Sunday in each week.   TheNorfolk Committee are taking similar action with regard to themills on the Wensum and other rivers.   In West Suffolk andFlintshire notices are also being given to occupiers of landto cleanse channels and maintain banks.                      Grubbing of Hops.          A number of applications have been received from hopgrowers for exemption from the restrictions imposed by Regula-tion 2NN.   These have been sent to the Agricultural  ExecutiveCommittees of the counties concerned for report.   The greaternumber of these applications have come from growers in Kent,and the Kent Committee have so far declined to recommend theissue of a licence in any case.                        Sale of Hares.          It having been represented thlvt occupiers of land weremaking efforts to reduce the numbers of hares in order toprevent injury to crops and pasturage, and that the hares killedmight be wasted as f*od if they could not.be sold, an Order hasbeen made under Regulation 2R making it lawful to sell, or expose
                                                           ill for  sale, any hare or leveret, notwithstanding the prohibition against their sale before the 1st August contained in the Hares Preservation Act, 1892.               Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).          Reports from 934 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that 172,320 applications for plots have been made, and 155,068 plots, containing a total area of 11,502 acres, have been pro- vided under the Order.          The above figures relate only to the provision of allotments by local Authorities under the Cultivation of Lands Order, and take no account of the facilities provided by other agencies for increased food production.   For example, the Department were informed during the week that 13,800 allotment gardens were now being cultivated on the property of the North Eastern Railway Company.                        HORTICULTURAL SECTION.                         *Pee* Preserving^ ^J\*LMJ&amp;\ T ^u-ji\          The Department have been devoting considerable attention to the question of the preservation of -fooekt   This subject primarily concerns the Ministry of Food, but at the request of the Food Controller it has been agreed that the whole subject should be dealt with by the Food Production Department.    Mr* C. S. Martin, v/ho has been In charge of the experiments  Invegetable drying which have been conducted for the Beard during the last three years  at Dunnington,  Warwickshire,  has been appointed to superintend this work.          Arrangements have been made  for the  supply  of  from two to four  million two-pound glass  jars for fruit and vegetable preserving in private households.   a  number of  travelling instructors  have been trained for giving demonstrations  in different parts  of the country.    Several are  already at work, and by the end of the present week,  it is expected that 25 willbe engaged in different  counties.   Orders  have  been  submitted                           -3-
to the Government Departments concerned for tin cans forcanning, both for trade and domestic purposes,  for glassbottles for the trade,  and for sugar for household jam making.          Enquiries made in Holland have resulted in the offer ofone of the chief firms  to export to England large supplies ofbeans pickLcd in brine,  and the Ministry of Food is being urgedto take steps to render this important supply of food availablein this country.          The two most  practicable means of preserving vegetablesand fruit on a large scale are drying and pulping.Drying.  It is proposed to adopt drying on a large scale forvegetables and, on a lesser scale, for fruit.   The advantagesare (l) the relief of railway transport; (the measure of reliefmay be judged by the fact that 100 tons of fresh vegetables,potatoes, swedes, turnips, onions, carrots and cabbages can bereduced by drying to less than 10 tons);  (2) extravagant usedue to glut, e.g. in the autumn months, is checked, and a reserveof food is built up; and (3) the loss due to natural wastagein crops from disease is prevented.          From negotiations already entered into with some ofthe principal firms dealing with food-produce,  it is probablethat a considerable increase in the provision of drying plantmay be secured by the encouragement of private  enterprise, andit is desirable to offer all the encouragement  possible tosecure this end.   It will be necessary to obtain priorityon their behalf for the manufacturers of the necessary machinery,and to give firms a guarantee with respect to the disposal cftheir output at remunerative prices.                            -4-
          On the  hypothesis,  however,  of a shortage of food thesaleability of dried produce  appears to be certain.  Even in theevent of no shortage the Army will require all the dried vegetableswhich can be produced for a long period to come, and there isgood evidence that,  failing other means of disposal, there is alarge market for  such produce in India.          To rely entirely upon private enterprise, supported byassistance from the  Department, is however insufficient, and it istherefore proposed to install a large number of drying plants,utilising for this purpose any vacant factories or breweriessituated within convenient reach of vegetable supplies.          From a  preliminary  survey it has been ascertained thatdrying plants cculd  be established with advantage in differentcentres in 14 counties  and,  subject to satisfactory arrangementsbeing&apos;made with the  owners, the Department hope to arrange fordrying plants to  be  installed at once at five centres wheresuitable buildings have been inspected. Enquiries are also beingmade as to the possibility of supplementing existing drying plantsby others to deal with gluts  of vegetables in the chief markets,Covent Garden, Borough, etc.          Owing to the urgency of the problem a preliminary orderhas been placed with Messrs.  Tomlinson-Haas for two drying machines.                                                                     IThe Tomlinson-Haas drying machine (6 chamber) is capable of dealingwith 90 tens of fresh vegetables per week, i.e. 2,340 tons duringthe 26 weeks that it is estimated it can be kept in continuousoperation.  The dried weight  of the weekly output is from 8 to 9tons so that the  total output of dried produce from one factoryworking for 26 weeks is about 230 tons.  The cost of equippingsuch a unit factory  is estimated at  2,300, exclusive of boilers.          The Department ore  considering the possibility ofequipping a large number of factories on these lines, and fullestimates will be submitted to the Treasury as early as possible.                             - 8 -
         Experiments  conducted  at  Wye,  Kent,  indicate that dryingof fruit  and vegetables  can be carried  out  successfully in Oasthouses, and it  is hoped  to  make  use of  vacant  Oasts for thispurpose.  The equipment necessary is receiving  consideration.Pulping.  In view of the difficulties of railway transport, therestriction on  the  supplies of sugar for jam making, and theshortage  of baskets, it  is  necessary to make provision in certainlocalities for  pulping fruit.  The  possibility,  therefore, ofassisting growers  in  fruit districts to combine and to put uppulping plants,  is  being carefully  considered.         The advantages of pulping as  a large  scale method ofpreserving surplus  fruit are:- (1)  that  a comparatively simple plantis required; (2) that  the pulp may  be stored in barrels; (3) thatlarge  quantities can be  dealt with  rapidly;  and  (4) the techniqueis simple.                         Potato Spraying.         2,585 Knapsack Spraying Machines  have  been sold duringthe week  together with 10,250 cases of  Spraying  Materials.Machines  and Spraying  Materials  have been supplied to the earlypotato district of  Cornwall.         A Spraying demonstration  has  been held in KensingtonGardens,  and was attended by representatives of  the AllotmentsAssociations and by county  delegates. Demonstrations have also beenheld in ten counties in  England,  and representatives of the Departmenthave addressed  public  meetings at three  centres  near London.         The demand for pamphlets  distributed by the HorticulturalSection continues.  During  the week 5,372 pamphlets on vegetablecultivation have been  distributed.   The  horticultural representativesnow number 340.  40 additional Food Production Societies have beenformed during the week.
                       TECHNICAL DIVISION.-aste  from  London Cattle  Markets.  At the request of the LondonCattle Markets  Committee,  v/hich is considering the scientificdisposal  of the waste  products  of their slaughter houses, two visitshave been paid  to the  principal market by a member of the AdvisoryStaff  to  investigate the  possibility of converting these productsinto manure or  pig food.   A report on the subject is being sent tothe Markets Committee  with an offer of further assistance ifrequired.Linseed Oil as  Cattle  Food.   Enquiries are  being made on behalf ofthe Controller  of Oils and Fats of a number of persons known tohave had  some experience  in using linseed oil for stock feeding, therbeing  a considerable stock of linseed in the country.Wintering of Hill Sheep.   The subject of the wintering of hill sheepis engaging the attention of the Sub-Committee on Grass- Land.  Inview of the pressure of other classes of stock on lowland fodder,efforts are called for to  induce hill farmers with suitable land toprovide more wintering at  home.Skim Milk Cheese.   With a  view  to a better  use being made of thelarge  quantity  of separated  milk which is at present being mostlyfed to calves and pigs, farmers have been urged to convert thismilk into cheese,  and  a Bulletin giving full instructions as to themethod of manufacture  has  been  issued.Inspection  of Land.  A large area of poor grass land in East Devonhas been  inspected at  the  request of the Honiton DistrictCommittee.  It was found that the soil was poor and would requiremuch labour to  get an  appreciable return in 1918, and the Committee&quot;ill therefore be advised  that  the land is  not suitable for breakingUP.  A Bulletin on the breaking up of grass land has been prepared.
                          LABOUR.Civilian Labour8 for Harvest Work.   In connection with the schemethat is being organised by the National Service Department forthe supply of Public and Secondary School masters and boys, etc.to assist with harvest work, County Committees have been requestedto take the necessary steps immediately in order that an indicationof the likely demand for this form of labour may be obtainedduring the next two weeks.Soldier Labour.  Constant requests are being received fromAgricultural Executive Committees  and farmers that an additionalnumber of soldiers should be made  available for agriculture, andthere is at present an urgent general demand for labour forordinary farm work.   It is also necessary that there Bhould be noavoidable delay in getting harvesting completed this year, so thatfarmers may get forward with their Autumn work on the newProgramme.   The National Service  Department has accordingly beenrequested to obtain the neeessary  additional labour.          Reports received from the District Commissioners as tothe Agricultural Companies indicate that men are gradually beingadded to the Companies, but not at a sufficiently rapid rate tomeet the demands received from farmers.   At some 20 depots thedemand for men is greater than the supply, men being sent out assoon as they are received, other demands going unsatisfied.   Thesoldiers of these Companies now on the land number 8,081, out ofthe authorised strength of 11,500, and the National ServiceDepartment is being asked to have  further men sent to those depotswhere no men are available.                           *8-
prisoners of War.   Eight schemes for the employment of prisonersof war on agricultural work are now with the War Office.  In allthey provide for the employment of about 700 additional prisoners.                         WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH.          Considerable difficulty is experienced in getting fullreturns as to the women who have been enrolled under the NationalService Scheme for work on the land.  The returns so far receivedshow that 9,174 women have come before the Selection Committees.Of this number, 4,030 have been accepted and 5,144 have beenrejected.  Of the number accepted the Department have particularsof 3,549, and it appears that of these 1,548 are undergoingtraining, and 998 are in actual employment, the remainder arewaiting either for employment or to be placed in training centres.          There is indication of an increased demand for womenlabour, more especially for educated women.  The supply of recruitsof this type is at present insufficient, and steps are being takenin consultation with the National Service Department to augmentthe numbers coming forward.  The constitution of the Labour Sub-Committees of the County Executive Committees has undoubtedlyassisted in securing additional openings for women workers.          Group Leaders have been appointed this week in fivecounties and there are now 32 of these leaders assisting in theorganisation of part time work.                       MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS.Motor Tractors.   In previous Reports the number of tractorsreferred to as having arrived from America has been based oninformation received as to deliveries in Liverpool.  Until,however, the tractors had been assembled it was impossible to statethe actual numbers so delivered.  Through this cause an error hasbeen made in the total numbers given in previous Reports.  It is
now ascertained that the number of tractors owned by the Departmentat present is 626,  of which 136 are English made.  478 haveactually been allocated to Agricultural Executive Committees, andthe remaining 148 are being assembled.   The number of ploughsreceived by the Department is 725, of which 168 are American made,the remainder being of English manufacture.          During the week a further 35 privately owned tractors havebeen returned, leaving 90 of such tractors still under the controlof the Department.   The Russian Government has generously allowedthe Department to keep six of their Caterpillar tractors for anindefinite period.          Orders are being placed for 2,000 cultivators and 2,000rollers.  The placing of orders for other implements is beingdeferred pending the receipt from Executive Committees of informationas to local requirements.                             SUPPLIES.          The recently appointed Sulphate of Ammonia DistributionCommittee has met and agreed to a sliding scale of prices for theseason June 1917 to May 1918.  A letter to the makers and a pressnotice will be issued at once.  The Committee anticipates that thereduction in price during the summer months will induce dealers andfarmers to buy in advance sufficiently to prevent congestion atmakers 1 works.Lime.     Several large firms have been interviewed with regard tothe supplies of labour, and a scheme for increasing and regulatingproduction has been drafted for submission to the Treasury.Basic Slag;.  Inspectors have visited a large number of merchantsand dealers and have arranged retail prices for the coming season.Seed Corn.  Arrangements for purchasing wheat of the 1916 crop forearly autumn sowing are well advanced, and a scheme for buyingselected varieties of the 1917 crop has been prepared.  The British                             - 10 -
and Irish Corn Trade Association is setting up special DistrictCommittees to assist in the selection and purchase.Binder Twine.  A conference has been held with the Ministry ofMunitions and it is proposed to secure a guaranteed supply of20,000 tons of binder twine for the 1918 harvest.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.  Hon.  Rowland E.  Prothero,  M.P.      President of the  Board  of  Agriculture          and Fisheries.
