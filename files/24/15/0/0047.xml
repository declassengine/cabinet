ARLIA11KNTARY PROC&quot;:SURE.                                   Note by Mr.  Montagu.          I ask ray colleagues to  consider the question ofParliamentary Procedure in view of the excessive  strainthat will he imposed upon the Parliamentary machine ingiving effect to any adequate programme of reconstructionIt is clearly of little use for us to spend our time  indevising ways and means for attacking problems  whioh musthe dealt with immediately at the  end of the -&apos;/ar if  legisla-tion is to he hopelessly blocked  by an accumulation ofBills.   The Reconstruction Committee can and no doubt willrecommend the order of priority in which Bills  should betaken, but I think we must ask the Government to inviteParliament itself to review its existing procedure  in orderthat the necessary legislation can be carried throup-h in time.          If experience shows that the procedure suitablefor abnormal times is not adapted to peace conditionsParliament will,  of course,  not be bound by it,  but untilthe transition period with all its unforeseen and unforsee-able emergencies  has been tided  over som^  system of shortcircuiting would  appear essential.          The  category  of legislation which  should be xotthrough either before peace  is declnr^d  or shortly afterincludes Housing,  Liquor,  Public  Health, Education,  Agri-culture,  many  matters directly affecting Labour, to  say                                          /nothing,iJ3T.G.T. 9^7
 nothing  of  smaller Bills concerned with such questions as Patents, Company Law, Naturalisation, or of the measures arising  from those conditions of the transition period which cannot he foreseen.   In other words a programme which in ordinary times would be more than enough to occupy the life of a Parliament -ill have to be compressed into a period of months.          In addition to this, the temporary wr*r measures, particulars of which have been circulated to the Committee   will have to be reviewed and in many cases prolonged and amended  by Parliament.   Most of them will lapse automati- cally, but there are a considerable number which will give rise to  prolonged controversy under the existing rules of the House.   The print shows that up to the end of October l6l temporary measures had been passed, and since then manymore have become law.          It is not for me to suggest methods  by which the work of Parliament can be so accelerated as to  cope with this great mass of work.   That will be the business ofParliament itself,  acting on the advice presumably of a select Committee;   but I may be permitted to  say that if theprocedure of the Defence of the Realm Act  was  indispensable  inwar time as a condition of getting business through,  someequivalent device  would appear to  be no less necessary for dealing with the problems arising  out of the return to peace.E.S.M.26th April,  1917.
