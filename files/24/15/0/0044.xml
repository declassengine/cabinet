                                  DEPARTMENT  OF INFORMATIONi                                         IN T2I1IGBNCE  BUREAU,                  :/ESHXY   REPORT    OH    GERMANY.    May 28th to  June  4th,  1917.          :      !rhe week  in  Germany  has  heen uneventful;   affairs    appear  to be pursuing a  normal course which might have been    foretold.   Por the moment the chief interest lies elsewhere;    Germany is passive;   before taking any fresh step she is watoh*-    ing the course of events in Russia and in  Austria;  all turns    on the  progress of the revolution in Russia, and perhaps even    more on the  internal  evolution in Austria.                Lieanwhile the Chancellor pursues his course with    persistency  and apparent success.   The  violent outbursts    against him  in the Psn-German  press, to  which too much impor-    tance has been attached  in this  country, have now nearly run    their course and  for  the time  are dying  down.   The breach with    Scheidemann, which is perhaps  more apparent than real, seems to    be made up.    Sohejdemann has now gone to Copenhagen and he will    be enabled to represent  that the German  Government is in favour    of a reasonable peace and that no importance need be attached to    the demands  of the Pan-Germans.                His position indeed  has  been greatly strengthened.    One of the Conservative  Leaders, Herr von  Heydebrandt, attacked    him in a public meeting, using the words &quot;The man who has vilified    our Monarchy dares to threaten us with revolution&quot;.   To this the    Socialists have made  a pretty riposte;  on May 22nd the Vorwarts    published correspondence which had taken place in the summer of  C 1^16 between the  Chancellor and  General  von Gebsattel, one of the    leaders of the Conservative and  Pan-C-erman parties;  the point of
the General&apos;s letter was ;&apos;that the Imperial Government had toonarrowly circumscribed their political war aims&apos;&apos;;  he uttered aYarning against their refusal &quot;to make the most out of our certainvictory&quot; and added:-       &quot;It would be  the most fatal political mistake that could     be made and its immediate consequence would be revolution-     That word must  be uttered.    let people put themselves in     the ^olace of the home-coming warriors, every one of whom     cherishes definite hopes of some gain (from the war).     Instead of gain they find a seriously increased burden of     taxation on&apos;their return from the field.   Terrible dis-     appointiaent and embitterment will result.    There will be     no half-way house, and the nation, disc.ppointed after such     achievements, will rise in revolt.   The Monarchy will be     imperilled, nay, it will be overthrown.   The fate of our     nation will then be sealed.&quot;            The Chancellor naturally answered with a reproof suggesting that those for whom General von C-ebsattel spoke were violating in the grossest manner their duty to the crown.            This correspondence has apparently been widely known in Germany.   It is now published in the Voi-w rts;  this is ob- viously with the consent of the Chancellor,  and this shows the extent to which he  feels it necessary and safe to go in his repu- diation of the extremists.            Moreover?an article has appeared in the Horddeutsche header1. HCecil and Asquith on lngland&apos;s v/ar aims&quot;.   This contains the fallowing1 passage:       &quot;^part from the imputations contained in Mr. Asquitb/s     speech (in the  House on May 16), the principles expounded     by him coincide with those which have been upheld by Germans     in responsible  quarters both before and during this war,     Germany, in fact, wishes for no extension of territory for   &apos;  &quot;the purposes of self-aggrandisement or of politioal and     economic extension of power.   bhe wishes solely to&quot;defend     her own territory againsiTforeipn. plans of conquest and,     moreover, demands those guarantees which will ensure her     defence and self-protect ion in the future&quot;.   She finds herself     the more in agreement with the political end moral principles     advocated by Mr. Asquith inasmuch as in her treatment of neigh-     bouring foreign peoples such as the Poles she has not departed     from the path which Mr. Asquith prescribed in his speech on     the moral aspect of a policy of annexation. &quot;
       The suggestion as to agreement in principle with l.r,Asquith is noticeable and this goes further than anything wehave yet had from an authoritative source towards renouncingthe idea of positive gain in the war.       All shov/s that the Chancellor is persisting in hisefforts to work for peace &quot;without annexations and withoutindemnities&quot;.   Meanwhile indications continue to come fromvaried sources, especially from Switzerland, as to activityin Roman Catholic circles.       There have been attempts to enlist the higher militaryauthorities in the discussion on war aims.   The Chancellorpositively stated that his speech represented the views of theHigh Command; this was rudely contradicted, but probably with-out reason.   The Pan-Germans made an attempt to entangleHindenburg into a direct approval of their war aimB;  thisfailed.       It would of course be of immense value if we couldfind out.the real opinion of the higher military circles.On this as a matter of fact we have practically no informa-tion.   A telegram from Sir Cecil Spring-Rice states on theauthority of journalists who went to Berlin with Bernsdorffthat Hindenburg is taking no prominent part in political con-troversy, but that ludendorff &quot;who is now the biggest man inGermany:: is inclined to the &quot;democratic side!;.   As to Hinden-burg, this is probably true-   It may, I think, be said thatthere has been no indication since the time when his name be-oame prominent that he professes to be anything more than asoldier.   All attempts to identify him with one party or theother have failed.   As to ludendorff no further informationseems available.       We may however learn something from another source.During the -week the Emperor has made an address to his troops
and has also despatched telegrams to the impress end PrinceEupprecht of Bavaria.   These utterances deserve attentionfor they seem to show that he no longer feels himself ableto encourage the nation to believe in a German offensive.In his telegrams he used indeed the word &quot;victory&quot; but it isclear that he is only thinking of a defensive victory;  hesays, for instance, to Prince Bupprecht:  &quot;Make known to allthe leaders and the troops these my thanks, coupled with theconfidence that with God&apos;s help they will be victorious alsoin the future fighting.&quot;   And so, to the Crown Prince, hesays he iB full of confidence that the new fighting will alsobring new victories.   But the victories he thereby anticipatesare clearly only victories &quot;similar to those shown in the lastseven weeks&quot; i.e. successful resistance.       This is brought out even more clearly in his addressto his troops.   Here we have the expression &quot;It is now amatter of holding out however long it lasts&quot;.   This, I think,is decisive;  if he does not encourage hopes of any definitevictory we may take it that this is the opinion of the GermanHigh Command.   It is noticeable that speaking to the army hetells them that their real hope is in the submarines    Thepart of the soldiers is &quot;tough resistance so long as it may bebecessary&quot;.   Fullest confidence and admiration of the army forthis resistance, but no suggestion of anything more.       ^e- may tfeea i think take fct that the view of thehmperor&apos;s military advisers is that they can continue to holdout, that there is no immediate fear of a collapse on thewestern front, but at the same time there is no prospect ofan offensive such as that which the German military v/ritersspoke about some months ago.   If this is so, we can easilydeduce that the advice v/hich the General btaff would give tothe Chancellor would be that his wisest course would be to

If this is so, we can easilydeduce that the advice which the General Staff would give tothe  Chancellor would be that his wisest course would be to
try to get a reasonable peace as soon as possible;  he canlook for no more military successes and therefore there isfrom their point of view nothing to be won by continuing thewar.   On the other hand there is no reason for panic;  hecan afford to take the line that he is quite willing to makepeace when the Western Powers are ready, but he will waituntil they are ready.   This is indeed practically the posi-tion he has adopted.       There is an immense amount of information coming iftjomdifferent sources as to food supplies in Germany.   All is tothe same effect that the shortage is very serious;  the peopleare suffering great hardships; they are on the verge of starva-tion.   On the other hand no one seems to suggest that theywill not manage to hold out until the new harvest.       Prom the Sv/iss press and from such very occasional lightas we get from other sources on the internal conditions ofGermany, we are told that politically changes are taking place,Democratic and even revolutionary conceptions are spreading,and the I2mperor is oeasing to have the hold on the countrywhich he had.   How far this extends we cannot say.   As yetthere is nothing to indicate that there will be any realdifficulty so long as the v/ar lasts.   The stones which arecoming (whether true or not) as to Russian anarchy will nothelp.   The Germans, even the Socialists, are very proud ofGerman administration;  even those who are most discontentedwill be very reluctant to acquiesce in the suggestion thatpolitically Germany had anything to learn from Russia.  Thefurther the Russian Revolution goes the more inclined willthe nation as a whole be to say - this is no example for us;the liberty which we require we will get in other ways;Germans will not, like the Slavonic people which is two cen-turies behind tbe 7/estern Europe, be enticed into the pathsof anarchy and dissolution.                                           J.W.H.                                         5th May, 1917.
