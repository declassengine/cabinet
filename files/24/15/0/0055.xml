SJB 0 B E  T.G.T.955.                             4/MINISTRY OF SHIPPING.10 mTONNAGE  PRIORITY  COMMITTEE.SECOND REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN, WITH A STATISTICAL           STATEMENT FOB JULY 1917.(1)     At the  fourth and fifth meetings of the Tonnage Priority        Committee,  which were  held on May 22nd, and May 25th.respectively, the  import demands of the various departments for themonths of July  and August 1917 were considered.   The demands putforward by the  departments amounted,  for July,  to 3,243,390 tons,and for August  to  3,232,900 tons;   since the meetings an additionaldemand for 20,000  tens of Phosphate  rock per month has been made,which raises these  figures to  3,263,390 and 3,252,900 tons respect-ively.   As the estimated deadweight tonnage available in each ofthese months is estimated to be no more than 2,700,000 tons, thefollovfing deficiencies are shown:        Tonnage Deficiencies for July and August 1917.               Demands      Tonnage           Deficiency                            Available               Tons         Tons               Tons.July       3,263,390       2,700,000          563,390August     3,252,900       2,700,000          552,900(2)     As the result of the meetings referred to,  the represen-        tatives of the various departments were able to agreeto 3ome minor deductions amounting to 55,000 tons for July and65,000 tons for August,  figures which make-very little impressionupon the problem.(3)-     Many suggestions for reduction were discussed, but the       individual  departments could not take responsibility foragreeing to any reductions  beyond those referred to in the lastparagraph.(4)      In the  accompanying table  relating to July,  however,  I        have  worked out  a  theoretical solution of the  difficulty,and  it  is  submitted merely as  a  basis for  discussion.    It willperhaps be useful as showing the degree  of sacrifice which will bedemanded from each of the  departments, but there  is  obviously roomfor  very great  differences of opinion as to how the  burden of lossshould  be  distributed.(5)     The effect cf the  agreed reductions (par.2)  plus the        suggested reductions,  is to  change for  July  a deficit of563,390 tons into a surplus  of 18,200  tons.   The  latter figureis too small a working margin, for it  has  always to  be rememberedthat in the actual working out of tonnage  and cargoes there  mustbe loss as compared with  the nett results  of a  statistical statement,A further  margin, perhaps  of 125,000 tons  or more, will be affordedby the reduction in the White  Sea Programme,  and this; is certainlyrot too great for practical  purposes.
(6)        The  demand  figures for  August are  almost precisely the        ,  same as  those for July,  and it is  suggested that ifsome such programme as  that herewith submitted for July wereapproved,  the  decisions might  hold good for  August also.(7)       It will he seen that a reduction of 155,000 tons is          suggested in the food programme.   This- would reducethe desired stock of cereals to II weeks&apos;  supply at the/end ofAugust instead of 13 weeks1.(8)       As to sugar, the Food Controller has agreed to a          reduction of 15,000 tons.   This leaves 115,000 tonswhich, it maj.1 he pointed out, amounts to over ono pound and athird per head per week of the population of all ages.    It isfor consideration whether,  with a better system of distribution,this figure could not be cut Com to 1 lb. per head,  or less.(9)       As to timber, there is seme doubt as to the interprets&apos;          tion of the figures, end wo have not yet had  a formaldemand from the new Timber Controller, who was appointed afterthe last meeting of this Committee.   In the meantime it issuggested that in view of the perspective of the problem as awhole, it is hardly possible to bring in more than 60,000 tonsof timber in July.   As to  pitprops the Committee discussed thepossibility of using some battalions of the home army for thepurpose of cutting pitwood  at home.(10)      As to the Ministry of Munitions,  a further cut has          been suggested,  but it is proper to point out thatthe Ministry of Munitions  reduced its demands in June by 20 percent, and that the whole of that reduced demand is not beingactually carried.    The further reductions suggested for Julyare (l) to reduce  the iron ore to 500,000 tons,  and to reducethe remain&amp;or of the demand by 5 per cent.    The demand for50,000 tons of Phosphate Rock is fully complied with, however.(11)      As to the Board of Trade, serious reductions are          suggested in cotton, mineral oils, paper, etc.,  andit is suggested that immediate steps should be taken to ascertainif it is possible  to make  such reductions.    If it is not  foundpossible, then it  is obvious thatihe demands of other departmentswill have to be further reduced.(12)      As has been already indicated,  the August figures          are very similar.    The situation is  a serious one,and we have to remember that by December  the tonnage availablemay carry no more than 1,600,000 to 2,000,000 tons per  month,unless drastic steps are taken to i:icrease  shipbuilding andeconomise tonnage.
