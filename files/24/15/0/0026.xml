    THE WORK OF THE WAR CABINET...(Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil).      It  will  not be  disputed  that  the  War  Cabinet  is over-workedand that,  if this state  of  things continues,  cither the work willnot be properly  done,  or the health of  the  members  of the Cabinetwill break down, or more probably both  those  results will ensue.Can,  then,  the work of the  War Cabinet  be diminished withoutinjury to the  Public  Service ?  I think it  can.      The work of the War Cabinet may at present be divided underthree heads :-   (l)  The decision  cf  vital  questions of  policy,  such as thetheatre of war in which  our principal effort  should be made;the co-ordination of  the efforts of ourselves and  our Allies;dangerous&apos;disputes on policy with one or other cf our Allies;and also  such  important  questions as the Irish Question or theFranchise Bill.  -  These matters must be left to the Cabinet,unless Cabinet Government is to be  abolished.   (2)  Disputes between Departments on relatively  minor matters,as for instance  the question whether Hospital Ships are to begoverned  by the  War Office  or  the Admiralty conception ofInternational  Law; or the conflicting claims  of  two Officersfor fresh accommodation.      It  seems to me  that all  these questions ought to be dis-posed of  otherwise than  by  the Cabinet.   (3)  There  remains a  large  number of questions which are cfconsiderable importance,  but which  are  either not really offirst-rate importance, or else in their nature are  executiveacts not  involving decisions of policy: for instance,  the commandof the Palestine Force,  and the continuance of horse-racing.       It is obvious that there is a considerable number of questions,  including 9ome that consume a large amount of time, which might be held to come either in the first or in the third class.  The first thing, therefore,  is to have some machinery for sifting these questions.  Then there should be means of dealing with questions in the second and third classes without bringing them before the War Cabinet.       I suggest that these results could be attained by two main changes.  In the first place, two or perhaps three Stand- ing Committees of the Cabinet should exist,  One would deal with external affairs, another with internal affairs, and I think there should be a third to deal with Labour questions (which are likely to be of pre-eminent importance in the coming months). To these Committees all questions would be referred with which Departmental Ministers felt themselves unable to deal, or which Cabinet Ministers desired to have considered by them. They would consist cf a Cabinet Minister as Chairman and of such other Ministers as were directly concerned in the question under discussion; normally, for instance,  the Committee onI External Affairs would have the YI&amp;T Office, Admiralty, and Foreign Office represented; and the Committee on Internal Aflairs,
           i                                                   126the Board of Trade, Local Government Board,  and Home Office.But these Ministers would not he,  strictly speaking, members ofthe Committees any more than the Minister for Foreign Affairsis a member of the War Cabinet ; they would merely attend if theythought their Office interested in the subject under discussion.The allotment of business to these Committees Y/ould be primarilyin the hands of the Secretariat of the Cabinet, but any memberof the Cabinet could of course require that any particularquestion should be reserved for the consideration of the Cabinetitself.      In the second place,  it is an essential part of thescheme that neither the Prime Minister nor the Chancellor of theExchequer should be members of these Committees.  I venturerespectfully to think that one of the chifci  evils of the presentorganisation is that the Prime Minister has not nearly enoughleisure,  and I think that this has two bad results : firstly,even with all the prodigious energy of the present occupant ofthe Office, it is impossible for him to know what is going onin the various Departments of Government,  and to be ready at anyminute to intervene to set right anything that is amiss; andsecondly it is very difficult for his Colleagues to find a momentfree in which to consult him,  and this is the cause of a numberof questions being brought before the War Cabinet which reallyought to be decided by the Prime Minister and one of his Depart-mental Colleagues.      There are in my own Office many questions on which thePrime Minister ought to be informed, and indeed consulted,  butwhich it is quite unnecessary to bring before the War Cabinet as.a whole.  If I may say so.  this has always been the Constitu-tional theory with regard to the relationship &quot;between the PrimeMinister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  My Colleagueswill remember that, when the two Offices  were united some yearsago,  it was made a matter of criticism, that this consultationwas thereby prevented.      What is true of the Foreign Office is  true in a lesserdegree of the other Offices,  pa.rticulc.rly in time of war,  whenthe whole machinery of Government ought to be directed to oneend only.      To some extent the same considerations apply to theLeader of the House of Commons,  who. ought to be available forconsultation by his House of Commons Colleagues.      The plan here proposed would furnish the machinery fordealing with all Departmental disputes which,  when not otherwisecapable of settlement,- could go to one or other of these Committees.There is of course the possibility that the  Committees mightarrive at conflicting decisions,  or find themselves in dangerof doing--so.  In that case,  the question would have to go tothe Cabinet; but I should hope that it would be a very rare case.      The Cabinet itself would sit once or twice a week,  for thedecision of grave questions of policy; and I trust,  if I may beallowed to say 30,  that it will show rather, more self-controlthan it has-shown in the past in resolutely  excluding from itsdeliberations questions that are not iramediately connected withthe war.   All such matters must be deferred,  however importantthey may be in themselves.      It goes without saying that  the proceedings of the Committeeswould be reported daily to the Prime Minister and the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  either verbally or in writing,  as wa3 preferred.      The statements by the Military and Naval Advisers of  theGovernment would be made to the Prime Minister daily,  as they arenow,  and would be circulated to the other members of the Cabinet.If they ra.ised any really vital question of  policy,  a specialmeeting of the Cabinet would be summoned to  consider thorn, FOREIGN OFFICE,  Jst JUNE,  1917.
