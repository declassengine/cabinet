NOTES ON THE TONNAGE POSITION AND THE NECESSITY FOR A GREATLY EXTENDED SHIPBUILDING PROGRAMME.

In forwarding the accompanying report by the Statistical Advisers to the Ministry of Shipping in which the whole tonnage position is reviewed in the light of the latest experience of submarine losses, the Shipping Controller desires to add the following remarks:-

The basis of the policy of concentration on the North Atlantic route.

The Concentration of shipping on the short North Atlantic route is primarily a method of getting more work out of a given amount of shipping. But since the time spent in the danger zone is correspondingly increased, this method would also use the ships up more quickly unless the Admiralty were enabled (by the fact of concentration) to render that route appreciably safer than other routes. This is really the crux of the position. The Admiralty consider (see report of Sir John Jellicoe&apos;s Committee dated 17th May) that they will be able to secure a special degree of immunity for ships so concentrated on one main-route and, relying on this opinion, the Ministry of Shipping have felt justified in pressing the policy  put forward in Sir Leo Money&apos;s memorandum of the 4th of May 1917.

Apart from the element of added safety, concentration on the shortest route can only be regarded as a last expedient required to enable the nation to carry on until the situation can be saved by the application of the only remedy which will not sooner or later prove illusory, viz: production of new 
Lapping  on  a so tile  sufficient  to  balance losses.     The  nooeaoity for  a greatly extended shipbuilding pronrmri^e.         It  is  clear that  on the present basis of losses andassuming  the best use cf the available ships by concentrationon the Atlantic route,  an output of new tonnage at the rate offour  million tons  (gross)  a year by a date which will certainlybe not later than December, and may be earlier, is absolutelyBseentioli   How far we are justified in looking for assistancefrom  the  United States  io problematical.  According to the latestmessage from Mr,Balfour, the United States Government nay be ableto turn out  about  tOQO*,000 tons gross of new shipping is thenext  eighteen months,   But of  this only   proportion will at)sst  be available for our use.,  To put the proportion at 40^,000tons  by December,  the critical  late,  ;ili probably be over ratherthan  under the  mark,. It follows that we must be some means pro-dues  from the Tarda  of  this country (other sources of supplybeing for this  purpose  negligible) not less than 300,000 tons(;?ro3Q) a month from December  onwards.   The output to which weoan look  forward on  the basis of the preoent programme Is only125,000 tons.hUay-i  1917,
                                                  Strictly Confidential.REVISED  ESTIMATES AS TO THE SHIPPING  POSITION                           DURING 1917.Report by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton to thy                    Shipping Controller.To the Right Honourable      Sir Joseph Maclay, Bart.,            Shipping Controller,                    PART I. THE POSITION  IN  1917.SIR,      (1) On  the  19th  February last we  submitted  to you  a report in which weexamined the shipping position as it then stood, with special reference to the questionof  imports,  and arrived at the conclusion that  as  compared with 1916 (and afterallowing for the carriage of some additional imports  for the Ministry of Munitionsand the War Office) a shortage of imports to the extent of  approximately 8,000,000tons during 1917 was to  be expected.  Our estimates were based, inter alia, upon theassumption that the losses of British tonnage by enemy action would be approximately225,000 tons (gross) in April, 175,000 tons in May, and thereafter 130,000 tons a month.It was  assumed further  that the reduction in the entrances of foreign shipping fromApril  onwards  would be  20  per cent,  of-; the corresponding entrances in  1916,Although, as will be shown in paragraph  (8) below, our estimate of imports has beenclosely realised, the assumed  losses  have been exceeded, and we  have  therefore, inaccordance with your suggestion, revised our calculations.   (2)  The actual  losses of British tonnage by enemy action  since the beginning ofthe year have been as  follows : January  -February -MarchAprilMay (first 20 days)-  144,806-  312,831-  334,276-  512,732-  255,868   Events subsequent to April would appear to suggest that  the heavy losses of thatmonth may be regarded as abnormal, especially as the greater part of the losses ofthe month was concentrated in  two weeks.  We assume in the first place that it isnot necessary to  anticipate a continuance of  such heavy casualties, and thereforesubmit a forecast (A) based upon the following  assumptions as to the losses of Britishtonnage by enemy action during the remainder of the year 1917 : May     -June     -July     -August   -September-December-  350,000 tons (Gross).-  400,000-  350,000-  300,000-  250,000   ,,  in each month.   (3) Alternatively, in order  that the position may be examined from  the  point ofview of the continuance of heavy casualties, we present a forecast (B) in which  thelosses are assumed as follows :         May        June    -    -    -        July        August  -        September        October -        November        DecemberO (33) AS 3013 Pk 13  60  5/17   &amp; S510,000 tons (Gross).540,000540,000540,000485,000385,000330,000330,000itftjj59ftftftV
2   In each case losses are assumed to include vessels which are  so seriously damagedthat they either become total losses or are rendered unfit for service during  theremainder of the year.   (4) The entrances of foreign tonnage are taken in each forecast as two-fifths of theentrances in the corresponding months of 1916.   The revision of the estimates in thisrespect conforms to present experience and  connotes a further heavy reduction in theimports of  the United Kingdom.  This reduction is the more serious that  importsfrom the nearer European ports which are carried in more heavily laden vessels than theaverage, have been brought mainly in neutral ships.  The withdrawal of these  shipstherefore entails a greater loss of imports than the corresponding reduction of tonnageentrances would suggest.   (5) We have taken the present opportunity to scrutinise the basis of our estimatesgenerally and  to amend them where necessary  in  the light afforded  by additionaldata which have become  available  to  us since  our first report was  prepared.  Inparticular we  have included on a more exact basis the work of  the ships of between500 and 1,600  grobs  tonnage,  full particulars  as to which have only  recently beencompiled.  The resulting  amendments in our estimates  amount to very little in theaggregate.   Apart from the larger causes of variation referred to above they suggestthat a rather  smaller deficiency  of imports should have been expected in the  earlypart of the year, and a  somewhat greater  deficiency  in the later months  than weoriginally brought out.   (6) Since our report was prepared important administrative action has been takenin various directions and the resulting effects must be  brought into the new estimate.We have thus to include the relief from    (a) Transference of British tonnage from permanent trade abroad  to trade with         the United Kingdom.  Some  200,000 tons (gross) of shipping have already,         we understand,  been so transferred,, and about another 200,000 tons  are         expected to follow, these  becoming effective on  an  average about  two         months hence.   As it is proposed to employ the greater patt of this tonnage          on the North  Atlantic trade it will be more effective  in proportion to  the         whole volume of tonnage  than its mere total would  suggest.  This point         will  be clearly seen by considering that the general average number of         voyages made  in a year is three and a half,  while  on the North  Atlantic         route the average is about six.   (6)  Transference of British tonnage to the North Atlantic routes from  trade between         the United Kingdom and far distant ports.   (c)  Reduction of the Russian programme from the original maximum of 300 ships         to a maximum of 250 ships.   On the other hand wo find it necessary to  provide  for an increased  demand onmercantile shipping for military purposes.   (7)  The latest figures  available as to new ships, whether British built or purchasedfrom foreign countries, have been included.   As compared with our original estimatesthe tonnage  of British-built ships is somewhat increased  while that of ships  builtabroad is reduced ;  apparently the tonnage to be  obtained from this latter source willbe much more considerable in 1918 than in 1917.   (8)  We referred in paragraph 3 of our report of 19th February to the  benefit whichwe felt should be secured in 1917, as compared with 1916, from the closer control ofshipping which had been  and wras to  be secured.  We  pointed out that, at the time,we were  unable to  give  statistical weight to this factor, but we now feel justifiedin assigning a value to  it.   In the following  table  we  contrast the  imports ofJanuary-April  with  the  &quot; expected&quot;  imports  based  on  our  first  forecast.   Ineach case  the figures are divided into British  and  Foreign.^  In  obtaining  the&quot; expected &quot; figures effect has been given to the small adjustments referred to inparagraph 5 above, while the &quot; actual&quot; figures  extracted from the Trade Accountshave been  increased  by an estimate of the quantity  of  Government-owned goods   * The division is necessarily  approximate.  In order that the imports in British vessels shall not beoverstated care has been taken to assign to foreign vessels as large a quantity as they can justifiably beassumed to have brought.
which, though carried in vessels of which the tonnage is entered in the accounts, havebeen omitted from the imports shown therein.Month of 1917.	Thousand Tons of Imports.

The close agreement in the total, in face of the heavy loss of foreign entrances, is due to the fact that British ships brought over 12 per  cent, more than the estimate.  The larger part of the gain is attributable to February.  The estimate for the entrances for that month was based on the corresponding month of 1916.   The entrances of February 1916 were much below those  of  either January  or March,  but were  not unusual in this respect, the same feature having regularly presented itself in the statistics relating to a series of  years before the war.  In 1917 no such  decrease has  occurred, and relatively to the tonnage available the import work done in the month was far greater than that of-the previous year.  To some extent the same feature is seen in the  March and April figures; and keeping in view the further improvement which we expect from the cause mentioned in (a) of paragraph (6)  above,  it appears reasonable to  assume that throughout the remainder of the year the entrances will be increased by 10 per cent, as the result of the more  economical  use of  ships.  We should, indeed, not  be  surprised to find a still further  improvement  from  this  factor as  the administrative  policies of  the department come to full fruition.   (9) In connection wilh this  subject there  is another  point  which  in certain circumstances may become important, and to which in any case some weight must begiven.  When a vessel is transferred  from  trade between the United Kingdom and India  and the  Far East, &amp;c, to  service on the Atlantic route there  is not only a considerable shortening of  the voyage, but, owing to the elimination of intermediate traffic and the reduction of  space  required for coal bunkers,  a substantial increase issecured in the cargo carried for delivery in the United Kingdom.   Thus it is found that in  1916 the ships engaged in the European trade (other thanwith  Russia) brought into the  United  Kingdom cargo  equal, on  the average, to 160 tons  for every 10U net tons of shipping; and those trading between the UnitedKingdom and the United States and Canada brought in  153 tons of  cargo for every 100 net  tons  of  shipping.  On  the other  hand, taking  India  and  more  distant countries  as constituting (for  this purpose)  one  group, the  average weight of cargoreaching the United Kingdom was  only 104 tons to each 100 net tons of  shipping.The changes which are being  effected in the disposition of  British shipping shouldthus, in  the  course of a few  months, make  a  perceptible difference in the relative quantity of cargo carried.  At the extreme  this  would  be equivalent to an  additionof between  7 and 8 per cent., to the imports of  British ships ; in practical workingthe extreme-involving the elimination of trade  with the Far East cannot be reached,but it appears reasonable to assume  that, beginning with, say, an addition  to imports of 1 per  cent, in July, this . factor will steadily rise until  an addition of 5 per cent,is reached in November;  and  this assumption has accordingly been made.
   (10) The details of the new estimates are given, in Tables A and B appended.  Theymay be summarised as follows :    The gross tonnage of vessels  of  500 gross tons and upwards on     British registers on 1st May 1917 (excluding vessels launched but     not completed) was    -    -    - &apos;   -              -     -    -  16,162,000   The gross tonnage  available for bringing imports  to  the United     Kingdom on  the  same  date  (inclusive of vessels which were     employed on Government  service outwards, and bringing cargo on     the return voyage) was estimated to be -    -     -     -     -    -   7,227,000On\31st December 1917 it is estimated that these quantities will be  reduced as follows (after allowing for all losses and  gains in the  intervening eight months):                                                    On Basis A.   On Basis B.    Total gross tonnage......  14,471,000    13,211,000    Available for imports.....   5,949,000     4,689,000The estimated quantity of imports (in tons) to be brought in during  the eight months May-December is :                                                     On Basis A.  On Basis B.    By British vessels......  16,891,000    14,549,000    By Foreign vessels    -     -    -    -    -    -   4,115,000     4,115,000                                                    21,006,000    18,064,000    To  which in either case has to be added the imports already received (January- April), namely,  11,247,000 tons, making an  estimated  total for  the year  1917 of 32,253,000 tons on Basis A or 29,911,000 tons on Basis B.    (11) The full imports in 1916 are estimated  to have been 44,000,000 tons.  The expected reduction in 1917 on the new basis is, therefore, from 12 to  14  million tons according to the view of the situation which is  taken.  This, however, may not be the full extent of the  deficiency -to be  borne by the civil population.  The demands of the War Departments have substantially increased,  and to the extent to  which the increases have to be met a further shortage will fall upon civil supplies. 1   (12) New factors are created by the entry of America into the war.  Apart from the prospect of the diversion to European traffic of some of the shipping of the United States, the effect of which cannot be measured at present, there are the interned ships, as to which some tentative estimate may perhaps be made.  If it may be assumed that  500,000 tons  (gross) of  enemy shipping  in United States ports can be  made serviceable in the  next few months, two entries  to the  United Kingdom for  each ship  before  the end of 1917  can perhaps be  safely  reckoned  on.   Similarly, if 400,000 tons of enemy shipping  of the total in the South American ports can be made available an average of 1^-entries before the end of the year may perhaps be justifiably assumed, though  here, of course, at the  time  of writing  the attitude of the South American Republics with regard to active participation in the  war is less assured. But on these assumptions commodities  to the extent  of  1,500,000 tons might be regarded as available from the use  of enemy tonnage, when the deficiencies shown above would be reduced accordingly.    (13) The position as to imports included   in the  Trade Accounts  in the  four months-January to April 1917 is shown in Table C, the corresponding figures of 1916 being given for comparison.  It will be seen that in the  food group imports are down by nearly 1,000,000  tons, of  which grain and flour represent 577,000 tons.   Raw materials are reduced by over  1,300,000 tons and manufactured articles are diminished by about 650.000 tons.  These  two latter reductions have no doubt  been brought about to a large extent by control timber, for instance,  being down by 700,000 tons ;&quot;the reduction in foodstuffs is possibly due, in  part at least, to delay in nppHnrj; restricting less essential commodities.
                     PART  II. THE POSITION IN 1918.   (14) It is clear from the foregoing that  tonnage is  rapidly declining to a pointbelow which it cannot be allowed to fall further, and that the pressing question is thesettlement of a  shipbuilding programme, both  British and American, which  shallabsolutely secure to the United Kingdom the maintenance of the necessary minimumof imports.  There are here four questions to examine, namely     (i)  What is the necessary minimum of imports ?   (ii)  What is the constant amount of shipping required to maintain that minimum ?   (iii) At what  rate will our shipping be reduced  to  the point at which the new         building programme must become fully operative ? and   (iv) What is the amount of  new building required to  maintain the needed constant          amount of shipping.   (15) As to (i), the necessary minimum of imports, this is a matter for investigationby the  various Government Departments concerned, the  Board  of Trade being takenfor this purpose as representative of the commercial  interests involved  in the supplyof everything except foodstuffs and war material.   In connection with the estimates ofa somewhat  analogous character  which are periodically supplied at present for thepurpose of settling tonnage priority, there is some reason to think that  the motive ofa competitive struggle for tonnage is not always excluded in formulating requirements.This, of course, adds to the difficulty of framing statistical estimates in circumstancessuch as those which now confront us.   (16) The tonnage  requirements notified&quot; at the present time  (including a verymoderate allowance  of timber) reach about   million tons a month, or 3,0.00,000 tons,equal to 36,000,000  tons a year, if the special call of  the Food  Controller to build updepleted stocks be, for this purpose, not taken into account.   Of  this amount nearly13,000,000 tons  is  required by the  Ministry of  Munitions  (irrespective  of  aboutPi millions  expected to  be  carried  in  transports,  &amp;c), but  it is not very  clearwhether this quantity must be regarded as a minimum.   It must, however, be kept inview that if shipbuilding on a largely extended scale is to be embarked upon in theUnited Kingdom this  alone may create a large import  demand for the  time being.For the present purpose two figures  of  required minima  have been  selected, namely,36,000,000 tons  and  32,000,000  tons  respectively, these including all  imports onGovernment account other than any manufactured articles which are brought (fromCanada chiefly)  in  transports,  &amp;c, and  the total of which has hitherto been,  it isbelieved, at the rate of 1-g- million tons a year as above mentioned.   The actual quantity for which arrangements should be made is, as above explained,a matter  for investigation.  Those quantities here taken are  employed in order toillustrate the position, and because, on the best judgment  which we can form, thereal minimum requirement seems likely to lie between them.   (17) Taking, then, in the first place, 36,000,000 tons  as the minimum, what  is theshipping tonnage required to  carry this quantity, assuming  that the tonnage is keptup-losses, either by enemy action or the perils of the sea, being at once replaced bynew ships ?   The answer  depends partly upon  the further economies which  we can make inthe use of ships.  We have rather more than 900 ships trading between the UnitedKingdom and parts of the world more distant than the Q.S.A.   The situation is  suchas to require a large proportion of these to be brought into trade on nearer routes.The number which must be left must  be such as to carry the 4,000,000 tons whichis, we  are informed, approximately the amount of  essential imports, that cannot beobtained from Europe or North  America.   These imports, however, come from allparts  of the globe, and it is useless to expect  that vessels can be economically loadedto bring just these essentials, and no  more, from the more  distant  countries.  We,therefore, take 6,000,000 tons to be the quantity which must be brought from distantports, and on the assumptions,that the average duration of voyage is five months andthat the vessels  will load up on  the  average  to 150 tons of cargo  per 100 net tonsregister (which is much in excess of present achievement) we conclude that 600 slnps&apos;:i:&apos;aggregating 2,670,000 tons (gross) must be kept on these distant services.   * In calculating  the  number of sliips. we have, throughout this, part of the Report, ignored vessels ofunder 1,600 tons gross.                                 ...                                                                        A3
 :&apos; (18) As regards imports from  Europe  and North  America, we think it  maybejustifiable to rely on 6,000,000 tons in a year from foreign shipping (exclusive of theenemy vessels interned in American ports and new American building).   This leaves24,000,000 tons to be brought in British ships on these routes.  Assuming six voyagesa year (which  is perhaps rather high), and an average loading of  180 tons of cargoper 100 net tons register (which, again, is  considerably above present achievement),we  conclude that 800 ships,  representing 3,560,000  tons gross are required.  Anecessary margin must be kept for  vessels repairing (since only effective tonnage isincluded in the calculation), and for vessels  sunk on  the current voyage (for which thereplacing ships must start the voyages anew at the ports of origin).  For these itemswe must add, say, 500,000 gross tons.  &quot;We therefore need for mercantile  work          For distant voyages    -----   2,670,000 gross  tons,          ,, Europe and North America   -            3,560,000     ,,          ,, repairing, &amp;c.      -----    500,000     ,,                                                      6,730.000 gross  tons.   To this last total we must add that of the vessels permanently off mercantile work.At present this appears to be something under 9,000,000 tons,  but for various reasonsit will be something less later on, particularly when fche flUfll 40 to 50 ships  nowtrading abroad  the transfer of which has been arranged  are brought  into UnitedKingdom trade.  If it be  assumed that this transference of shipping from permanentwork abroad can be still further  augmented, so  that  100 ships  in all  are broughtinto  United Kingdom  trade, the tonnage on Naval, Military,  and Allied service orotherwise unavailable for home mercantile work may be put eventually  at  8,400,000tons, it being understood of course that no further increased demands will be made forspecial services of  any kind. The constant amount of  British shipping equivalentto imports of  36,000,000 tons  (of which  foreign  ships  bring  6,000,000)  is  thus15,130,000 tons.   Similarly, if  imports are cut down to  32,000,000 tons,  of which 6,000,000  tonsare still brought from  distant countries and 6,000,000  tons are brought by foreignships, the required constant amount of British shipping is 14,540,000 t3ns.   (19) As to the time when British shipping wall be reduced  to these quantitiesrespectively, we estimate as follows :    (a) If 36,000,000 tons of imports be required :          If losses are as in Table A (see paragraph 2, above)    -  End of Aug. 1917.                    ,,      ,,  B (see paragraph 3, above)    -  Mid July 1917.   -(b) If  32,000,000 tons of  imports be required :          If losses are as in Table A  -  &apos;.....End of Dec. 1917.                               B  -                           Mid Aug. 1917.   (20) The amount of shipbuilding to be arranged either in the United Kingdomor in America must be governed by  the  assumptions  made  as  to the  rate of  loss,bearing in mind that  the  foregoing  estimates require the  minimum  quantitjr ofshipping stated to be kept up constantly to full strength.   Ordinary marine losses asw-ell as losses  sustained by  enemy action  must be made good ; and  if the conditionjust postulated cannot be satisfied, as is obviously the case if shipping is to be reducedto its minimum by July or August of the present year,  a margin must  be takento make good later on the deficiency  on minimum imports which  is bound to arise inthe next few months.   Taking these  facts into consideration it may be suggested that4,000,000 tons (gross  register) during a year is not  too  much  to secure if  the destruction by the enemy should be anticipated at the  average rate of 250,000 tons  a month.  Even this  large quantity of tonnage, if it  should come late into service (and it would be late if the required  quantity of  imports  and the rate of loss  be such that shipping is down to a bare minimum in  the  next two or three months), would be insufficient to  secure the necessary minimum of commodities over a period of twelve months, and it would be necessary therefore to secure the services, direct or indirect, of all the enemy shipping interned  in North American ports in order to  bridge the gap.    (21)  In conclusion  we think it necessary to lay stress on the fact that our calculations assume that no greater amount of British shipping than at present would be devoted to the services of Allies unless it brought back return cargoes to the United Kingdom.  It would for instance be impossible to  allot 250 ships  as  a maximum to the White Sea
programme unless assurances could be given that every ship on  the service would beable  to  bring  back  cargo,  and  cargo  of  a kind that contributed  to  the  essentialrequirements of this country.
