                WAR CAB LEST. From Colonel Blair. Te Director of Military Intelligence.                                          Petrograd,                                         7th.June, 1917. 1150.      I was told by the General Quartermaster here  that in his opinion the Russian Army cannot continue fighting after the Autumn.   He considers that the Provisional Government should definitely make up its mind whether it is going to fight or not because a continuance of the present inactivity is the worst policy of all.   In answer to the repeated resolutions passed by committees of units at the front an army Order has been issued that all officers or other people holding officer&apos;s rank and all men (3 groups undecipherable) employment and i n Red Cross or similar organisations in rear who are fit and under 40 years of age are to report themselves, within three weeks to the Staffs of Fronts for service in fightingunits.    As the Ministry of Labour has intervened and employers have made more  conces-sions,  the strikes whichwere to have taken place  yesterday have been postponed fora day at all events,  but  concessions  are  always met by theworkmen with still further  demands.           The C-in-C at  Moscow in an order issued by himpoints  out the inadvisability of allowing prisoners of warto walk abouVthe streets  of Moscow.
