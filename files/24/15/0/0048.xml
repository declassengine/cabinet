      WAR CABIffST.                R.C. Bo.82SUPPLY AJfD TRANSPORT H-OBLEMS OF THE      SBAB3X9I0I PERIOD.Hevised Hotc by Mr.Honteftu.                    C E.C. Ho.68 revised)             Assuming that shortage of materials, food andshipping will exist for some time after the War,  I suggest thatthe Committee consider the following principles with a view totheir adoption by tho Government  1.    That the control now exercised by tho State ovor        shippine bo continued during the transition period, due        provision being mede for demobilisation requiremento.  3.    That the control over imports and exports bo also        continued,  3.    That the control ovor food be continued:   such control        to bo applied as the exigencies of the tine raoy demand.             The control over materials should be oxorcioed Intho first instance with a view (a) to supplying those materialswhich sro most essential to starting the main industries ofthe country on a peace footing:   (b) to securing the provisionof materials, machinery, &amp;o., for the reconstruction of Belgium,Prance m&amp; other ravaged countries: (e) to making- the beetarrangement possible in the circumstances for regaining foreignmarkets and steadyIzr the exchange.             The case for control Is that the transition periodis bound to present conditions which it would bo  Impossible                                                           for
t  for private trade to contend with without grave danger to the interests of the community.             If the various systems of control maintained during the war over shipping, food and raw materials, with all tho paraphernalia of priority arrangements as to imports and tho restrictions over exports, were suddenly abolished, morchants, manufacturers and financiers might indeed rejoice, but we should have to look forward to a period of Intolerable confusion, with freights and prices soaring up as the rush to buy goods and to charter ships made itself felt.   The only safe forecast on which we can work at the problems of the transition period is a forecast of insufficient food, materials, and, above all, of shipping, and this means that the stampede would,  if itwore unregulated,  be tremendous;  that articles of necessitywould be olbowed out by luxuries;  ships would be chartered for bringing commodities that could very well wait, while thegoods essential for reconstructing the devastated countrieswere kept back;  that bricks and timber and girders needed forbuilding workmen1 s houses might be used up in building greathouses or theatres, and so on ad infinitum.             Control 1B not advocated because a crippled community will require clutches, but because with the depletion of necessary stocks and the deterioration of works and services of all kinds on the one hand, and tho limited supply  of transport end material on the other, some temporary system of State guidance, information and direction is indispensablebefore free methods of trade can be relied upon again towork effectually.             In this connection, too, let us remember tho extent to vhieh entire industries, or the material on which  they                                                          depend
 depend, hare been taken over by the- State *   i^nryom knows tho scale on which tho Ministry of Ignitions has been operating, but we must remember to  that tho  ar Office is practically the sole purveyor of juto, leather, wool ond flax, that the %r Office and the Admiralty are holders of enormous stocks,  that all shipping but inter-coastal is requisitioned anft that collieries and railways  are controlled by tho State.   The method of centralised pnrohasin^. marketing ond transport,  whatever its drawbacks, in tho method which war has made current, end this has come about because there was no other way of accomplishing what had to  bo done;   end the problem that  we have  to think about before  peace eonsee is how much of this now machinery ought to be utllsed in the process of recuperation,  how much should bo scrapped or re-adapted, how to enlist tho co-operation of commerce and industry with the methods of control that will  have to bo considered.           England, as the greatest ship-owning country ia,more than any of  her Allies, compelled to face  those problems, as on her will fall the main burden of finding  and apportion- lag tonnage for the requirements of hoe elf and  her Allies, end on the disposition, on the precise use  made of such tonnage, their convalescence and recuperation will depend. France and Italy  are not  debating those questions very seriously, probably becauso they look to us to  help them to a solution of them.   Bat, as the papers circulated to tho hoconstruction Committee  show,  the  Central Powers,  and notably Crormany,  ere much pro-occupied by these very questions.           The Gormen Government has appointed  a special Department, attached to tho Ministry of the Interior t  to deal with post-bellum economy with an Imperial  Commissioner at its head.   Extreme secrecy is  observed  about the Plans of
 the Department, which lies been entrusted with far-reaching powers over private trade and shipping.   Kerr Hallor $  the Yice-I&amp;rector of the Siemens-Sehuchert Electtioal rorko at  Berlin hss, however, recently published a critical article In  the course of which he suraises, in e manner which sugreste inside knowledge, that the following principles of policy have been aeeiaed upon In &quot;responsible circles&apos;,  end this Is borne out by other evidence.      (1) The entire Gorman cargo space will be put under Imperial Control.      (i) The import of goods and raw materials will be rationed on the basis of the  Import figures  for the lastyear of peace, import prohibitions being applied to certain goods i      (3) Private individuals are not to be  allowed tho Independent disposal of tkelr credits abroad or propertywhich they might use to obtain credit abroad.      (4) The export of raw materials and manufactured goodswill be supervised.      (5) The distribution of imported goods will be un&amp;ertokenby special organisations also working under  State supervision^in such a way that even the smallest businesses will graduallyresume working simultaneously with the largest *           Herr Holler subjects these proposals to  vigorous criticism on the ground of excessIve rigidity end urges thatnot the whole but only a fixed percentage of the  cargo space shell be put at the  disposal  of the Imperial Commissionerand that the control of the wsr Companies over  imports and exports shall also bo  limited and be brought to an  end at tbe earliest possible moment.           Since my  suggestions were discussed  and  the Committeeprovisionally agreed to reconmend a policy of control over                                                         shipping
shipping, imports and exports as well as over food,  Ithas become apparent that much of iho control machinerywhich has been set up by ourselves and our Allies will bethrown into the melting pot as a result of America^ comingia.           It may woll be that the new or remodelledorganisations for war purposes which will ensue can  beadapted to supply the needs of transition,  but I wouldsubmit that these matters should be considered by raycolleagues with a view to submitting principles for  decioionto the Government and urging upon them the  necessity fordevising an organisation which must be (1)  ready for peace( ) inter-departmental end (3)  possibly international forcontrolling and  ensuring so far as possible the necessarysupplies ana transport during the transition period.
