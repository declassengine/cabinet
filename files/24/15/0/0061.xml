Printed for the use of the Cabinet.  June 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. 5EMPLOYMENT  OF CHILDREN ACT,  1903,             Clause 13 of the Education Bill, 1917.    1.  THE Employment of Children Act,  1903-    (a.) Enables a local authority to make bye-laws with the sanction          of the Home Office regulating the employment of children          under the  age  of  14 (the Education Bill proposes that          these bye-laws  should be made with the sanction of the          Board of Education instead of the Home Office);    (b.) Enables local authorities to make bye-laws with the sanction          of the Home Office regulating the employment of children          under the age of 16 in street trading (it is not proposed          to alter this provision);    (c.) Prohibits the employment of children in street trading under          the age of 11 (the Education Bill proposes to substitute          the age of 14 for the age of 11);    (d.) Prohibits the employment of children between  9 P.M. and          6 A.M., unless the hours  are  altered by bye-law with the          sanction of the Home Office (the Education Bill proposes          to substitute the  hours  of 8 P.M.  and  7 A.M., and to          abolish  the power of variation).    2.  The Board  of Education desire to  substitute the Board ofEducation for the Home  Office as  the  department  to sanctionbye-laws under section I for the following reasons :     First, under the proposals  of the Education Bill, all childrenwill remain  in  school full time till the age  of 14.  The primaryconsideration  in deciding  what employment out  of school  hoursshould  be allowed is whether the employment is consistent with thechild feoin obtaining proper benefit  from education  in  school, andwith its healthy^- mentaL- and  physical development.   The  HomeOffice have no experience and no means of obtaining experience as tothe effect of employment on education ;  that experience can only beobtained by the Board of Education, whose inspectors inspect elemen-tary schools.   Even the evils attaching to juvenile employment whichdo not directly deprive children  of the benefit of education are mostlikely to manifest themselves, and are most  readily observable in theelementary schools.  Thus  any deterioration in the physique, morals,or manners of the children consequential  upon the employment onwhich they are occupied will inevitably reveal itself in the course ofschool work.    Secondly, the Board  of Education by its system of medicalinspection has a unique knowledge of all questions of health, so far asrelates  to children attending  school.   They supervise  the  systemunder  which  all children attending school are medically inspected,and very many of them are medically treated.   &quot;Where the health ofchildren is injured  by employment out  of school hours such injurymust come under their notice, and there is no security that  it willcome under the  notice of anyone else.

2     Thirdly, it  is agreed that the local  administration of the Act-should  be in the  hands of  local education  authorities, as such.Local education  authorities are in  constant  relation  with the Boardof Education  on all  questions relating to  school children,  and itwould be both inconvenient and undesirable  that  they should referto  the  Home  Office  on the  matter.    They  certainly would notrecognise that the Home Office has the same authoritative knowledgeon the subject as is possessed by the Board of Education.     Fourthly, though the Employment of  Children Act, 1903, hasnow been in force for thirteen  years, bye-laws under the Act  haveonly been made  in  19 counties  out of 63 counties  in England andWales, in 125 boroughs out of the 207 boroughs, and  in 28 urbandistricts out of the 48 urban  districts which are authorities underthe Act.  The Departmental  Committee on  Juvenile Education LaRelation to Employment after  the War expressed the opinion tliat,where the powers under the Employment of  Children Act, 1903, hadbeen exercised, the bye-laws were very often  laxly administered; andthe Departmental Committee appointed by the  Home Office in  1909expressed the opinion  that in areas in which no bye-laws had  beenadopted there was very frequently a failure to carry out the statutoryprovisions  of the  Act,  while those provisions  were  not  alwaysobserved, even where  bye-laws  existed.   The  Board attribute thegeneral  ineffectiveness of the Act partly to the  fact that the HomeOffice inspectors are mainly occupied by other matters, and have noaccess to the public  elementary schools, where they would have thebest opportunities for acquainting  themselves with the evil  resultsarising from the excessive employment of children of school age.    Fifthly,  the  evidence  of  the  Board&apos;s  inspectors as  to theprevalence of excessive employment of school children, its injuriouseffect upon their education, and the ineffective  manner in which theemployment of children  is at  present regulated  is emphatic.  Thematter is really one of notoriety to all persons concerned in educationaladministration.    Sixthly, the effect of making attendance at  school compulsoryup to the age of 14 is  to establish a clear line of demarcation betweenchildren below and  children above that age.  The line is far moreclearly marked than the line between legislation relating to educationand legislation relating to employment, especially having regard tothe fact that the Education Acts contain many provisions governingemployment.   No  administrative  inconvenience  or  confusion  willresult from the fact  that children, as soon as  they leave school, wouldbecome subject in the matter of employment to the control of anotherauthority.    3. With regard to the other amendments proposed, the Boardof Education have  suggested  that street trading for children under14  should be  abolished,  because the  Home Office DepartmentalCommittee recommended the  prohibition  of street trading for boysunder 17 and girls under 18.   The Board of  Education  have limitedtheir proposals to the age of 14, because they desire to confine theiraction to the case of children  attending elementary  schools.  Theywould regard  any further extension of the  age as a matter for theHome Office.  The Home Office suggest that the existing definitionof street trading should be narrowed.   This is a minor point, and theBoard  of Education would be prepared to  consider any proposalswhich might be made  in that direction.    4. The  Board of Education suggest  that  the employment ofchildren under 14 should  be prohibited between the hours of 8 in theevening and 7  in the morning.   The Home Office suggest that sucha prohibition would  be too extensive, especially if it were to coverthe period of school holidays.   This  proposal  is  of a tentativecharacter, and  the Board are  prepared  to  consider  any  othersuggestions which may be made.  They consider, however, that inno case should a  child who is attending school be employed after 8 at

HARRISON.- 6/0/1017.                               3night or before 7 in the morning, and, in fact, there is a strong casefor taking  the view that the child should not be employed at all inthe  morning  before he  goes  to  school, and  it is possible that theprohibition of employment between 8 P.M. and 9 A.M.  on school-daysmay be the be8t line to take.     5.  The Home Office do  not concur in my proposal to transferthe jurisdiction as regards children under 14 from them to the Boardof Education,  and  I therefore  find it necessary to ask for a Cabinet-decision on the question.  I also desire  to have the approval of theGovernment for the other alterations of the law which I propose.                                                   H. A. L. F.     June 4, 1917.
