The maximum price includes all charges for bags and other packages.      A contract for  sale of 2,000,000 qrs. of wheat from Arabia at 59s. Qd. per qr. delivered at Alexandria was offered to the Wheat Commission by a previously unknown vendor in  April last.  In view of the fact that the Grain Trade had no knowledge of grain-growing in Southern  Arabia and that there was also doubt as to freight, finance, quality, price, and title, the Commission informed the vendor that before going further into the matter they required conclusive evidence that there was a substantial quantity of wheat in that district capable of being exported.  Inquiries were made through the India Office, and in  response to a suggestion from the vendor  the Wheat Commission  have informed him that they were  prepared to  purchase any such wheat if offered to  them through a responsible firm of corn merchants at the price of 37s. per qr. of  480 lbs. at Aden.      At the request of the  Shipping Controller the  Wheat Commission have arranged  to ship wheat to  Greece  from Calcutta.  Greece has hitherto drawn supplies from* North America, and the new arrangement will save tonnage and remove our  competi-  tive buyers from the American market. The first shipment from Calcutta was made  during the week.      The Flour Mills Control Committee have decided  that the prices of flour and  offals now prevailing in  every district  should remain as at present, pending the  Committee&apos;s decision as to their general policy.  The non-milling  members  of the  Committee are conferring  with representatives  of the Advisory Committee of Master  Bakers  for the purpose of  determining the margin between wholesale prices of flour  and retail prices of bread, to be allowed to .the baker for producing and selling bread  over the counter.   .      Meat. As a result of conferences with representatives  of  all branches of the  trade, the following proposals are under consideration:       (1) That  an Order be issued  prohibiting buyers  of fat  cattle from re-selling             except to a buyer who should be compelled or undertake to slaughter any             cattle so bought within 14  days from the date of the sale.       (2) That  a salesman selling a  carcase, side, or quarter should only be allowed to             charge 3d. a stone above the price at which he bought, a further penny a             slone being chargeable if the carcase, side,  or quarter is  cut into smaller             joints.

     Fish. The Committee appointed by Lord Devonport to acquire,  control,  anddistribute stocks  of  cured fish, whether  home-cured or imported, and  to  take suchsteps as may be advisable to increase the  imports  of  fish for the British markets, hasbeen constituted as follows :              Sir ALFRED HOPKINSON, K.C. (Chairman).             Mr.  H. G. MAURICE,  C.B.             Paymaster D. T. JONES, R.N.R.             Mr.  W.  I). JOHNSTON.             Mr.  T. ROBINSON.             Mr.  P. J.  G. ROSE.             Mr.  ARTHUR TOWLE.                                     Secretary,  Mr. R. A. C. CHOLMELEY.     Sugar. No further losses  of cargo have occurred during the past week.     As from the 28th May the Sugar  Commission has raised  the wholesale price  of sugar by some 5s. per cwt., in consequence of the higher prices that it has been, and is being, compelled to pay in the countries of  production.  A rise of 5s. per cwt.  in the  wholesale  price represents a rise of id.  per lb.  in  the  retail price, and with certain sugars, and in  certain establishments, this  increase in the retail price will be necessary.   But it will be by no means universal, because as a measure  for  enabling it to exercise a closer control over retail  prices, the Sugar  Commission have adopted a simplified classification of the various kinds of sugar ; and it is hoped that, thanks to this, it will be possible to keep the prices in many shops at the same, possibly even at a lower, level than has in fact prevailed for some time past.     Tea-The control of 40 per cent, of all imported tea from India and Ceylon at aprice enabling the same  to be sold retail  at 2s. 4d. per  pound  has proved successful.It has, however, become necessary to exercise further control over the  remainingGO per cent, of imports ; and it  is now  arranged that after the conclusion of nextweek&apos;s sales the present arrangement for controlling 40 per cent, of supplies shall besuperseded by the following:      30 per cent, to be sold at auction at  a price between lid.  and  Is. per  pound for       retail at 2s. id.                                                      -     35 per cent, to be sold at auction at a price between Is. 2d. and Is. 3d.  per pound       for retail at 2s. &amp;d.     25 per cent, to be sold at auction at a price between Is. bd. and Is. Qd.  per pound       for retail at 3s.     The balance of 10  per cent, will be sold in the  usual manner forming a freemarket for the highest quality of tea.     Provisions.- By  the Cheese  (Requisition) Order,  1917, dated May 29,  1917, theFood Controller takes  over from  the original consignees all cheese  which shall  beimported into the United Kingdom from  the United States, Canada,  Australia, andNew Zealand.  Contracts for sale made by the original consignees are cancelled andthe purchase price to the original consignees pa3rable by the  Food Controller remainsto be subsequently settled.     Consignees are required before the 9th June to furnish the Board of Trade withfull particulars of all cheese taken over under the  Order.  The Food Controller  hasmade arrangements under which the Board of Trade will shortly place a quantitj^ ofcheese in the market at a price which will enable retailers  to re-sell to the  public atIs. 4J. per  lb.                            FOOD ECONOMY CAMPAIGN.     Empire Day (May 24th) was  observed as a  Food  Economy Day and the  Kmg&apos;sProclamation was publicly read at largely  attended meetings held in all  parts of  thecountry.  Food Economy pledge cards were signed  by the  hundred  thousand.  InWorthing,  as a typical  instance, 2,(575 houses were  visited on a  personal  canvass andsignatures  to the pledge were obtained Lt 2,440 of these.  The mayor records  the factthat the total expense incurred in  this local campaign was 5s. Qd.     Two cinema films  illustrating the necessity for food  economy are being releasedfor exhibition all over the country within the next two or three days.     With the approval of the Admiralty, 500,000 leaflets urging the saving  of breadand breadstuffs have  been distributed among employees in shipyards and  factoriesengaged on naval work.  Exclusive of  these, 1,271,000  leaflets and  153,000 postershave been distributed during the week.
    In addition to the Central Kitchens already reported, others have been opened inSimderland, Manchester, Batley,  Ealing,  East Greenwich,  Sevenoaks, Lewes,  andMossley.                            ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.    There have been several successful prosecutions for waste of bread, and  there isevidence that much greater care is now being taken both by bakers and  by privateindividuals to avoid waste.    There has been a fair number of  prosecutions for contraventions  of  the PotatoOrders, and in a case at Wisbech the defendant was convicted on six counts and finedin the aggregate 120 L    A newspaper report that two grocers had been convicted, at the Stratford Courtfor refusing to sell sugar caused some  alarm  and produced  a  crop of  inquiries.   Itwas ascertained, however, that the report was inaccurate and  that in both cases  thedefendants had contravened the Food (Conditions  of  Sale) Order, by refusing to sellsugar unless other goods were bought.  The condition in  one  of  the cases  was thatthe purchaser should place with the defendants  firm a  weekly order  fur groceries.A correction of the inaccurate report has been made  by the press at the request ofthis Ministry.    An alleged case of food hoarding in Scotland was found on inquiry  to  be withoutfoundation.    The inquiry into potato sales, which was mentioned last week, is  proceeding  andhas brought to light many  more cases of illegal prices having been charged by fannersand others.    Pending  a settlement of the question of milk prices, measures for the enforce-ment of the existing Order have been taken only in flagrant cases.   Three retailers atHolton, near Leeds, were prosecuted at the instance of the Ministry for  retailing milkat a higher price than the maximum.   They were each fined 51.    A meeting of the inspectors of the Ministry was held on  Tuesday, and a  numberof points which had arisen in the course of their inquiries in their  districts werediscussed and settled.   A press notice was published on the 30th May inviting thepublic  to  report contraventions of the Orders to the police or the local authorityconcerned, with a view to saving correspondence and insuring a more prompt  disposalof complaints.                PART II.-SUMMARY  OF  FOOD POSITION.                                   IMPORTS.    There was a further increase in imports of food during the week ended 26th May,the total quantity of the principal articles received (Table A) amounting to 280,000 tons,compared with 239,500 tons  in  the previous week, 260,000 tons in the correspondingweek of 1916, and a weekly average of 206,000 tons during the first 21 weeks of thisvear.      The articles mainly responsible for  the  improvement were wheat and wheaten flour, sugar, oats, and maize.  The imports of wheat were over 159,000 tons, compared with 128,000 tons  in the preceding week and a weekly average of 97,000 tons during the present year.  Those of  sugar amounted to 32,500 tons, against 22,700 tons in the previous week and an average of 22,400 tons this year.  The imports of wheat en flour amounted to 15,700 tons, compared with an average  of 8,000 tons ; those of oats were 9,500 tons,  against  an  average  of  6,800  tons, and  the imports  of maize were nearly 37,000 tons, or 2,700 tons better  than the  high average for this year.  The imports of beef were  also, above the  average, but  the quantities of mutton and margarine received were very small, and  those  of  bacon  and hams, lard, butter, and barley were below the average.t     The total imports  of fifteen  of  the principal foods and feeding-stuffs  in  the first 21 weeks of 1917 amount to 4,334,000 tons, compared with 4,771,000 tons in the corresponding period of  1916,  a reduction  of 437,000  tons, or  9 per cent.  The articles showing the greatest decreases are barley (179,000 tons), oats (124,000 tons), wheat (llo,000 tons), sugar (139,000 tons), and  wheaten flour (54,000 tons).   A month ago the ueficiency in wheat  amounted to 168,000  tons.  The total imports of  beef, mutton, hams, and margarine are also considerably below those for the correspondingA 2
fperiod of last year.  On the other hand, the imports of maize are greater by 182,000tons and there are &quot;substantial increases  in  the  quantities of  lard, cheese, and butterreceived.                             CONSUMPTION OF MEAT.     The supplies of dead meat entering the markets in London, Manchester, Liverpool,and Glasgow, in the week  ended 19th May (Table B.), were  7  per cent, less than inthe  previous week and  nearly 14 per cent,  below those of the corresponding week in1916.  These decreases, however, are  due entirely to reductions in  the quantitiesreceived at London and Manchester, the supplies at Liverpool  and Glasgow showingslight increases both on the previous week and, in the aggregate, on the correspondingweek of 1916.   In the first three weeks  of May the average weekly supplies  inLondon were 12 per  cent, below the average  for  April and 1(3 per cent, below theaverage  for  the corresponding period  of  1916; at Manchester they were much thesame as in April, 1917,  but 6 per cent, less than in  May,  1916 ; at Glasgow there waslittle change as compared with either April, 1917, or May, 1916; while at Liverpoolthe  supplies  were about the same as in April,  1917, and rather above the  average forMay, 1916.                     ...     In the week ended  26th May the  supplies in  London showed increases of 151 Percent, on the previous  week and nearly 10 per cent, on the week ended 27th May 1916.     The supplies of fat cattle received  at  51  markets in the  week ended 23rd Mayf Table C), were 10 per cent, less than in  the previous week but were still consider-ably greater  than the average for the corresponding weeks of  1914-10.   The numbersof fat sheep showed a sharp decline, being  10  per cent,  below those for the previousweek and 18 per cent, below those for the corresponding weeks of 1914-16 ; while thesupplies of fat pigs, though 7 per cent, greater than in the week ended 16th May,were nearly 4 per cent,  less than the three years&apos; average.     In the three weeks ended 23rd May the supplies  of  fat  cattle were considerablygreater, on the average, than in April, 1917, or in the corresponding weeks of 1914-10,while those of fat sheep were much less.  The supplies of fat pigs were a little greaterthan in April, but somewhat,  below the average for 1914-10.                                STOCKS OF CEREALS.     Wheat. The  stocks of wheat (including  Hour expressed as wheat) on 28th Mayare  estimated to  have amounted to  1,165,000 tons compared with  1,103,000 tons aweek before, 1,063,000  tons at 1st May, and 1,410,000  tons a  year ago.     Barley. The stocks  on  23th May are estimated at 374,000 tons,  compared with386,000 tons on 21st  May, and 419,000 tons at 1st May.     Oats.-The stocks  on 28th  May are  estimated at 254,000 tons, compared with293,000 tons on 21st  May,  and 392,000 tons at 1st May.     Maize. The stocks on 28th May are estimated at 113,000 tons,  compared with 120,000 tons a week before, and 148,000 tons at 1st May.                                WHOLESALE PRICES.     The principal changes in the wholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs (Table D), as compared with those for the previous week, are increases of 10s. Gd. per cwt. (over Id. per lb.)  in Argentine  chilled beef, 5s. Qd. per cwt.  in  English mutton, and  4s. per cwt. in English beef, and decreases of  4s.  per cwt. in New Zealand butter, Is. per cwt. in Irish butter. Is. per sack in country &quot;straight run &quot;  flour, and 15s. per ton in palm-kernel cake.  The prices of cereals. London flour, bacon, Argentine mutton, cheese, sugar, oil-seeds, and  oil-seed cake (other than  palm-kernel cake)  showed  little or no change.      As compared  with a month before, the outstanding change in  prices is a rise of 41s. per cwt. (or nearly A\d. per lb.; in English mutton.  Argentine  chilled  beef is also dearer  by 21s.  per cwt., or 2\d.  per lb., and English beef by 13s. per cwt., or nearly l^d. per lb., while  Argentine frozen mutton is  cheaper by  14s. per cwt., or lid. per lb.   There  are  also increases of 4s. per quarter (480 lbs.)  in Plate maize, 3s. Qd. per cwt. in Irish bacon, Is. Qd.  per cwt. in Canadian bacon and Danish butter, and of  20s. per ton in  palm-kernel cake, and  decreases of 68s. to 90s. per ton  in oil- seeds and kernels, 4s. Sd.  per 400 lbs. in British barley, 3s. Id. per 312 lbs. in British oats, 3s. Id. per 480  lbs. in British wheat, 3s. Qd. per cwt. in  Irish butter,  2s. per cwt.
in New Zealand butter, 2s. per sack in  country &quot;straight-run &quot; flour, and Is. per cwt.in Danish bacon.  There is no change in the price of imported wheat, town-made flourin London, rice, Canadian cheese, cottonseed cake, or sugar.Since the corresponding date in 1916 there have been marked advances  in  thelinseed (210s. per ton, or 54 per cent.), and rice (9s. M. per cwt.,  or 52 per cent.).British  wheat,  Plate  maize, Canadian bacon, and cheese are  dearer  by between40  and 50 per cent., English mutton,  London flour, Irish  bacon,  and Egyptiancotton-seed by  32 to  26 per  cent.,  and British  barley,  English  beef, Argentinechilled beef,  Danish  bacon, Irish, Danish,  and New Zealand  butter,  and palm-kernels by 20 to 26 per cent.  The average sale price of tea, including the proportionallocated direct to buyers at Is. per lb., is about id.  per lb. above  the average price atthe auctions a year ago.    The articles  showing least increase in  price are  sugar and Argentine  muttonfor each of which  the advance recorded is insignificant.A 8
