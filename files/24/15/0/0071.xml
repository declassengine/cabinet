            From Viceroy, Foreign Department,  (ith June 1917.                  (Received at Tndia Office 7 a.m., 7th.)   Secret.   Mahsuds.  Our telegram  of  the   1st  instant.   Roos-Keppel,Donald,  General Sir A.  Barrett  and General  Beynon  are unanimouslyopposed  to  any attempt  to  effect settlement  with  Mahsuds  at presentjuncture.   Roos-Keppel considers  at  least  one successful  action agaiustMahsuds  is absolutely  necessary  before  negotiations  are  attempted.Negotiations if  now attempted would certainly be  protracted by Mahsudsin order to enable them to collect harvest, and could  not, Roos-Keppelthinks,  possibly  lead  to  satisfactory issue.  Moreover,  eftect  on  otherFrontier tribes  of leaving Mahsuds unpunished after their recent  successeswould be seriously deleterious.  In view of this  concensus of opinion whichwe are forced to accept, we must  let  the  orders stand for the advance viaJandola.  This will probably take place on the 10th or 11th of June.
