                                             DRW/007.            WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA.  VII-                   (June 6,  1917).Parliament and Proposed Reforms.     A wire from Sir George  Barclay shows that the first few days&apos;discussion in the Rumanian Parliament provoked stormy scenes.Apparently Mr Bratianu&apos;s statement  of the proposed reforms did notsatisfy the House.  The new party,  calling itself a Labour party,which has been formed and apparently consists of some 20 deputies,brought forward its own programme,  going much further than that ofthe Government in the direction of  administrative changes anddecidedly Socialistic in character.  The leader of this newparty appears to be a certain Diamandy (?).  There is noinformation to hand as to who this  is, but he may possibly be theDiamandy who was a follower  of Take Ionescu and a stronginterventionist.  Nothing has been  published as to the compositionof his party.  It will be remembered that the present Chamber ofDeputies consists of 138 National Liberals (Bratianu&apos;s party),22 Conservatives (who have since parted into two groups: (a) thepro-German neutralists who followed Marghiloman, and (b) theFilipescans who for a year past have been &quot;fused&quot; with Take Ionescu&apos;Conservative Democrats), 18  Conservative Democrats (followers ofTake Ionescu), 2 Nationalists (Cuza and Iorga), and 3 Independents.There were no Socialists or  Labour  members in the Chamber, whichis not surprising considering the character of the franchise andthe method in which elections were  conducted.  But apparentlyPoliticians are already beginning to angle for the new Peasantand Socialist vote, which in the event of the enactment of the
proposed  changes  in the  franchise  will count enormously inparty politics  in future.    It is  of great interest and importanceto see if this  new   vote will  be exploited by any of the presentpolitical leaders,  or  whether  it will be at the  disposal of anentirely  new Socialist party led by men who have hitherto foundno place  in the Rumanian Parliament.   It would be also interestingto know whether the so-called  new  Labour Party has the tacitapproval  of Mr  Take Ionescu or wishes In any way to work withhim.The Moral of the  Rumanian  Nation and Army.     News comes from Iasi  that the Rumanian Army has now beenlargely reconstituted and  that as  a result of the training anddiscipline to which it has been subjected during the last fewmonths is in a  very much better state.  It seems at least thatan excellent impression  has been made on the Army and Nation asa whole by the  visit of  M. Albert  Thomas.  The Rumanian peoplehave seen in this visit  an assurance that the Allies have nointention of losing interest in Rumania and that they have everysympathy  v/ith the country.  Nothing has been published aboutMr Kerenski&apos;s visit to Iasi.Conditions in Transilvania.     The  Hungarian  paper Alkotmany announces that the Kronstadt(Brasov)  paper  Gazeta Transilvanlei, one of the oldest establishedRumanian  papers in  Hungary, has been suppressed.  Most of theRumanian  papers in  Hungary were suppressed during the first twoyears of  therwar  before  Rumania&apos;s  intervention.  Up till May, 1916,at least  ten (more  than  half)  had   been forced to cease publication.
                            -3-No clue is given as to why the Gazeta is suppressed at thisparticular moment.  During the Rumanian occupation of Kronstadtit appeared as a strongly pro-Rumanian organ, &quot;but after theretreat was of course forced to return to an attitude ofcomparative loyalty to Hungary.  The new measure may be partof the system of increased severity towards the Rumanianpopulation of Transilvania in conformity with the promisesmade by the Hungarian Minister of Justice, Balogh, to theHungarian House of Representatives on March 3 last (quoted inWeekly Report No.  4).                                       A.W.A.L.                                         June 6, 1917.
