DESPATCH  A 3.From Brigadier-General A.  Knox,  Military Attache.                       SUBJECT-NORTHERN FRONT.                                              British Embassy, Petrograd.gir                                                              1st May, 1917.    I have  the  honour to send some notes on my visit to the Northern Front betweenthe 17 th and 25 th April.    1. Artillery for new  divisions. The newly raised divisions are all to have threeG-gun 3-inch batteries each,  but very few  of them  have as yet got  any guns.  The20th Siberian Division will have its three  batteries in a few weeks; the 138th and 182ndhave already got theirs.  The 109th  and 110th Divisions have already got  their fullcomplement  of six batteries each.  The Special Divisions are without guns.    A battalion commander  in the  1st  Lett Brigade who had been  a month in thetrenches did not know where his supporting  batteries  were,  though  he pointed out atelephone that he said led to the battery commanders position.    Artillery inspectors consider the supply of 3-inch and light howitzer shell sufficient,but want more of the larger calibres.    2. Machine guns. The machine guns, including Colts and allowing 16 Maxims foreach cavalry division, work out at an average of about eight per battalion.  The Coltsare in  detachments of eight  guns;  they are nominally  at the disposal of the corpscommand but are actually attached to regiments.    There is a shortage of 3-line ammunition, but abundance of Japanese rounds.    3. Trench mortars. The command  ask for trench mortars of long range (1,200metres).    4. Aeroplanes. The  12th  Army has 23 aeroplanes and the 5th only 15.  Theyconsist of Voisins of the  type in use in France in January, 1915, Moranes of 80 h.p.,Bebes of only 50 h.p., as the engines have run over 200 hours.   The machines  are  saidby the French pilots to be  so weak that proper reconnaissance is impossible.                                   Strength.    5. Deserters. There were said to be a million deserters before the revolution.  Thenumber that have deserted since is said to be not far short of half a million.  The Stanof the Northern Front acknowledges  the desertion of 12 per cent,  of the rank and file.Unfortunately, M. Guchkov&apos;s promise that all deserters that returned by the 28th Maywould be pardoned was interpreted by some units as a grant of general leave till that(late and has at any rate temporarily increased  the number of absentees.    All men of over 43 years of age are  to be excused service.  Men. of 40-43  havebeen allowed to go back to till their fields up  to the  28th May.  Under this order onthe Northern Front 16,000 men were  sent off from units in front and 30,000 from thelines of communication.  Their  places have been filled temporarily by men from thedepot  units of the front.    In spite of desertions first line units are said  to be up to strength.                             Discipline and  Moral.    6. Order No. 1. Prince Lvov said on the  14th April that  the army  could  takecare of itself and that  discipline had not been relaxed  on account of the visits ofagitators.    All officers know that the discipline of the  army, never  sufficiently  strict evenbefore the revolution, has  now been  entirely sacrificed owing to the weakness of theGovernment,   Order No. 1* did the mischief.  The events of the 12th and 13th March   * The now famous OrJer No. 1 was issued by the Council of Worlringmen and Soldiers, and advised thesoldiers to take the discipline of the army into their own hands.    (B17/350)  20  6/17 H&amp;3  458Swo
 were known on the same day at Pskov, but officers were not allowed to speak of them. On the 14th Order No. 1 appeared, and discipline went at once.     Only  one officer  is believed to have  been killed on  this  front-the  second  in command of a regiment of the 14th Cavalry Division, which had been sent to Ryejitsa to  quell disorders.  Numbers of officers, and generally those of the  best type, have been expelled by the  men.   Numerous elected committees  have robbed  the officers that remain of all semblance of authority.     7.  State of 12th Army. Probably the  state of the 12th Army is  worse  than that of the 5th.  Workingmen  and soldier deputies  boasted to me that the 12th Army is the  &quot; most democratic of all the armies.&quot;  Not one man in ten salutes in Riga.   The committees of the 12th Army are composed entirely of soldiers, and will not  permit an officer to become a member on the ground that this would weaken their authority with the men.   In Dvinsk  the  men salute officers  much  more and  the &quot; 5th Army Com- mittee &quot; has 8 officers  to 37 soldiers.     8.  The elective principles. The elective principle and the principle of combination have always been  suppressed in Eussia.   Now that &quot;freedom&quot; has been  won, the general ambition is to elect or rather to  be elected  and to combine.  This is all very natural, and  no one who  knows the Russian  will be surprised that &quot;freedom&quot;  is interpreted as freedom to talk without end and to do nothing.     This  parliamentary touch may find defenders  in civil affairs, but  there can be no difference of opinion regarding the turning of units  in contact  with  the enemy into political debating societies.     The system of committees, however, has come  to  stay.   Their form has  developed in the past 6 weeks in  directions increasingly radical as a result of constant pressure by the men, and the harassed Command has looked  eagerly for an authoritative statement from the Government to set some limit to  the madness of the moment.     9.  New Army Order. This has now come.  On the 29th April the  Minister of War- issued as an Army Order the regulations drawn up  by General Polivanov&apos;s Committee for company, regimental and army committees and for &quot; disciplinary courts.&quot;  Polivanov&apos;s Committee  included   five  members  of  the   Council  of Workingmen  and  Labour Representatives, and it is therefore hoped that  its  proposals will receive more respect than the Order,  which was issued by General Headquarters  on  the 12th April, for a similar purpose and which was simply disregarded at the front.     According to Order 213 of the 29th April, the company  committee will  consist of six members, elected by secret ballot of the whole company for 3 months.  Officers may be elected.     The regimental committee in  the  infantry regiment will consist of  one repre- sentative of the  men elected  by each company for G  months, and officers elected by the officers of the regiment in the proportion of 1 officer to 5 men.     &quot; Army Assemblies&quot; consisting of delegates from all the units of the Army elected in the  proportion of 2 officers and G soldiers  from  each infantry  regiment  will  be called at once.   These  assemblies will elect by  secret  ballot for, in the first instance, 3 months, and later for G months,  15 officers  and 30  soldiers as an army  committee.     The committees  are  to maintain  order  and discipline in units, prevent any peculation  in the administrative services,  prevent arbitrary conduct  on  the part of officers and officials, smooth over misunderstandings between officers and men, promote sport among the men, prepare for the Constituent  Assembly by maintaining constant contact with  political  parties, the  invitation  of  political  propagandists  and  the dissemination of political papers.    It is laid down that the Company Committee is  not  to  interfere  in questions of military training or military operations or  in the specialist work of the staff.   There is no similar provision  regarding the regimental and army committee.     10. Award  of punishments. All  power of  punishment is  handed over to  the &quot;disciplinary courts,&quot; officers only  retaining the right to &quot;warn&quot; or to &quot; reprimand.&quot; Details  of  the composition and  powers of the regimental court have not  yet beenpublished.  The  company disciplinary court consists of an officer&apos;(president) and twosoldiers (members)  elected  by the  company for a period of G months.   It can awardthe following  punishments  which  can  be  carried  out at once,  confirmation beingunnecessary :                Confinement to barracks up to  30 days.               Eight extra duties or eight extra fatigues.               Five days simple arrest with or without duty.               Five days strict arrest.               Two days extra strict arrest.
    This idea of handing over the punishment of the men to mixed courts  may be allvery well in peace time, but how is the officer  to assert  his authority in action ?  It iscommon knowledge that in the  past in many regiments  it has been  only  the fear ofpunishment that has driven the men forward.   A  General points out the followingparagraph with pride :          &quot; In action a superior officer has the right to undertake on his own responsibility    all measures, including the  employment of armed force towards subordinates who    fail to carry out his orders.  Such measures are not considered ordinary disciplinary    awards.  An officer must at  once inform his superior officer and  the  committees    concerned of the special steps he has  taken.&quot;    This does not amount to anything.   The men are being taught to disregard theirofficers in peace and they are unlikely to obey him in war, and the officer who attemptsto use force to compel them will simply be shot.    It remains to be seen to how many of the above regulations the  committees nowworking at the front will agree.    11.  Choice of Delegates. Speaking generally, the delegates chosen are better thanone has a right to  expect, though in the company committees many of the  men  arebarely litterate.  One Sunday at Riga recently the men of various  units stormed abrewery and several were drowned in the vats.  Two  members  of  the  12th ArmyCommittee who were sent to reason with the men, unfortunately got drunk themselves.They were turned out of the organization with every mark of contempt.    12.  Sentences of Soldiers&apos; Committees. The committees want to get all power intotheir hands.   The 12th Army Committee  has published in its paper an analysis of thedoings  of the  so-called  &quot; Arbitration  Committee,&quot; which commenced work  on  the30th March.  It states that it inquired  into 96  cases of quarrels between soldiers andofficers (sic).  Of these, 46  resulted in &quot; complete agreement between officers and soldiersto forget the past.&quot;  In the following 50 cases the committee recommended :     1.  The dismissal from the service of 3 officers.    2.  The transfer to other units of 37 officers, of whom 12 should be court-martialled           for breech  of regulations.    3.  The removal from his appointment of one doctor.    4.  The dismissal of 2 nurses for rough treatment of soldiers.    5.  The dismissal of 6  officers for criminal actions.   Of these 2 to be tried  by court           martial.    6.  The removal from his appointment of one general.    7.  The severe reprimand of one general.    The Staff of the Army told me that this statement was published by the Committeeto pretend to the men  that they wielded a greater authority than is actually the case.One general retired of his own  accord, and another was told  by  General  Radko-Dimitriev, Commanding 12th Army, to be more tactful in future.   All the same,  thepublication of such  a  statement at Government  expense, and without a protest fromthe Command,  shows  how little attempt is  being  made to  defend  the  prestige ofofficers.    13. Army Committee. The army committees do their best to restore order in unitsthat threaten to get out  of hand.  For this  purpose the 5th Army Committee has aso-called &quot; agitating section &quot; that travels about in the army.    The soldier delegates are of  course  totally  ignorant of military science, but theydo not hesitate to interfere.   They ask the unfortunate Chief of Staff of the  12th Armysuch questions as:  &quot; Why is the-Regiment on  the line it now occupies  and  notsome 200 yards  further back ?&quot;  This hard worked officer has to explain for hours  thenecessity for avoiding interference in the detail of  arrangements made by a subordinatecommander.  Correspondence has increased to an incredible degree.    The Russian officer  is  the most patient in  the world, but  he  now  requires asuperhuman allowance of patience.   The General  Quartermaster of the  12th Armytold me  that a private soldier  had the impertinence to ring him up and  ask him tocall to the telephone a soldier friend of his in the office.     An ensign of the  1st xlrmy said the other day :  &quot; If we are now ordered to attackwe will  send a delegate to examine the artillery position, a second to count the shelland a third to select  the point of attack, and  only when their reports  have beenreceived will we consent to go forward.&quot;     (4588)
    14. Army newspapers. The 12th Army has got three papers,  all of which areprinted&quot; and published free at Government expense.  The Staff News of the 12th Armyis strictly official and daily.   The Officers  News of the 12th Army and the  SoldierDeputies Neivs of the 12th Army appear two or three times a week.    15. Numerous deputations. Officers complain that the Government has allowedthe army to bear all the  burden of political agitation.  Endless deputations visit thefront.   One man with a pass signed by the  Minister of War was stopped by the 12thArmy  Committee because his programme  was :  &quot; Not a step in advance under anycircumstances.&quot;  At  Riga I  had a long talk with a  deputation  from the PetrogradCouncil of Workingmen  and Soldier  Deputies.   They consisted  of a workingman,.asoldier and a journalist.   They thought that the army would fight better than ever itdid in a month&apos;s time, but 1 am afraid that that their opinion is worth nothing.   In theArmy  Committee at Dvinsk I  met a deputation from Kronstadt,  consisting  of twosailors  and two workmen.   They pretended that  the defences of Kronstadt  had beensaved by the revolution for an order of the late Government to destroy them had beenfound at the quarters of the  Commandant.   I asked who had signed the order, and ofcourse  they did  not know.  Though  there were several  officers of the  5th ArmyCommittee present, not one of them had the courage to tell these murderers that theywere lying.   The workmen  said that  double the quantity of mines necessary wereready and that the &quot; 38 &quot;  officers killed were no loss to the defence.    16. Parleying with the enemy. Many  of the deputations encourage the  men  tonegotiate with the enemy.  The peace at  any  price organ, Pravda (Truth), writes ofthese  negotiations as noble  spontaneous manifestations of the will of the  sovereignpeople.  Even the Novoe Vremya suggests that fixed points should be selected  forcarrying them  on.   The  command does  all it can to prevent them and there is noindication whatsoever that the moral of the enemy is being affected.  German visitorsto the Russian lines take  away bread  and photographs of our positions, the Russianpeasant, in returning the  visit,  tells all  he  knows  of our dispositions and comes backhappily drunk.   However, the time may arrive when the Russian soldiers will be betteras diplomatists than fighters.    17.  The worst Division. The 109th Division is probably the worst in the RussianArmy and its worst regiment is the 436th.   This Division was mentioned in a despatchof February,  1916, as being  of doubtful quality and it has been since then continuallyin the  trenches.   The  ringleaders of the 436th Regiment are Lieutenant Khaust andEnsign Sievers, the latter of whom assumed Russian nationality only two years beforethe war.  Some days ago they published a proclamation in German and  conveyed it tothe German lines.   The  men from both sides collected in  large numbers between thetrenches and a battery of the 8th Heavy Brigade opened fire on the crowd.    Khaustcame  to the battery, arrested the two officers  there and took them off to be tried.They were subjected to every kind of indignity and were only finally released owing toa  threat of the gunners  to  open fire on the &quot;court-martial.&quot;   On the 20th April,Khaust, Sievers and  nine soldiers of  their regiment appeared at  the Assembly  of the12th  Army and demanded  the  immediate conclusion of peace, the  Germans  andRussians to lay down their arms simultaneously.   A soldier deputy who  was  there toldme that the general attitude was so hostile that  only the personal intervention  of theJewish soldier, President Rom, saved the  party  from bodily hurt.  General RadkoDimitriev says it is impossible to arrest these men as it would cause  bloodshed, so theyare still carrying on their propaganda now in reserve about a mile from  his  house.It is good to report  that  the army committee has  told the owner of the  press thatprinted the proclamation  that if he does such things in future  not  only  his press buthis head will be broken, and  it has expressed a determination to have Sievers murderedif he cannot be arrested.    18. Expelling officers. Officers have been expelled by their men for the most sillyreasons.  Colonel Ausen,  the Commander of the 1st Lett Brigade, one of the best officersin the  army,  was forced to go because being a  good soldier he took no interest  inpolitics.  General Polivanov  said yesterday that there was now no place for such menin the  army and that they had to go.   I pointed out that we should soon have an armyof excellent politicians but without any militarv instinct.    The men of a regiment in the 1st Caucasia*n Rifle Division were asked  why theyobjected to their  commanding officer.  They said : &quot;  He worries us.  He  wants theregiment to be always first in the Division.  When he is in the  trenches he does notwant the regiment to -be  relieved,  and when  we  are in reserve he always wants to getback to the trenches.&quot;  The officer had to leave.
    Three charges were formulated against another colonel in the 5th Army :     1. He  greeted  each  company separately instead of the whole regiment together.           (In this he acted according to regulation.)    2. When  embarking a  reconnaissance  in boats to cross  the  Dvina at night he           carried an electric  torch  with which the men were convinced he tried to           signal to the enemy.    3. He was always sending  men on reconnaissance.   &quot; In  fact,  he was willing to           sacrifice the lives of even six men in order to gain a single German shoulder           strap.&quot;    19. Fantastic ideas  about treason. There are the  most fantastic ideas abouttreason.  A non-commissioned  officer in the 144th  Regiment  told me he had himselfcounted 14,000  head of cattle  that were driven to the front by the order of the oldGovernment in order that  they might  fall into the hands of the enemy when theRussians evacuated Vilna in September, 1915.    The men of the 138th Division have expelled  their commander, his Chief of Staffand two out of the four regiment commanders.  The objection to two of them was thatthey had German names, and yet these very soldiers are ready to fraternise freely withthe enemy.    A young officer  in the  Instructional Company of the 20th Siberian Division toldthe Divisional Commander that  the men wanted to  get rid of their commander on theground that he was an adherent of the old regime.   He quoted three instances to provehis contention:     1. He had ordered the  speaker to attend church with his company,  but the youtli           considered that as freedom of conscience had been proclaimed he should not           be ordered to go  to church even with his company.    2. He insisted on evening  roll-calL    3. He refused to allow the men to go to Riga without signed passes.    20. Men unwilling to fight. The Staff of the XlXth Corps sent me  to talk to the731st Regiment &quot; an average  regiment,&quot; they called it.   After speaking to them for afew minutes, I told them that  the Allies were taking the offensive in the West to givethe Russian army time to settle down, and  I asked whether in a few weeks they wouldbe ready to commence an offensive, too, that the war might be  quickly ended.   Therewere cries of &quot; No.&quot;   The majority evidently did  not want to fight.  They talked allsorts of nonsense : &quot; The Government want us all  to&apos; be killed, so that  our wives andchildren may be starved by the landowners.&quot;  &quot; We have  attacked  and attacked andnothing has come of it.&quot;   &quot; England is only beginning to fight and we  have beenfighting the whole time.&quot;   &quot; Russia  has not only  to defend  her  own  long frontier,but she has troops  in Roumania  and  in  France.&quot;   &quot; We dont  want to fight, weonly dream  of our wives and  children.&quot;  One man asked when the war  would end.1 said : &quot; As soon as Russia takes the offensive along with her Allies.&quot;  He said :&quot; And if we are beaten ?   We have  had many Allies, but it  is all no good.   TheGermans are people like ourselves.   We want to live in peace.&quot;  &quot; The devil take tire16 Governments we have lost.&quot;    21. Men -who are like children. The men are like children, and much can be  doneby an officer of courage and  resource.   Unfortunately there are  few  such officers nowleft in the Russian Army.  The other day the Colonel  of the 13th Siberian Regimentwas approached with a request  that the men should be allowed to go to the trencheswithout their packs.  He explained how  when a boy he  had tried to mow hay, and thefirst day he found he ached all over.  Then he worked a little every  day and soon foundthat he could mow as well as anyone.   He asked  &quot; Why,&quot;  and they all replied that hehad got accustomed to the exercise.  He explained  that it was  also essential that themen should get gradually accustomed  to  carrying their  packs,  so that they  should nottire on the line of march and they should always be able to get ready quickly in case ofalarm.  The men agreed, and now  they  go equipped  to  the trenches,  while  theregiments on their right and  left do not.    On another occasion the same  Colonel heard that the men of one company wantedto get rid of their commander.   He went to ask about it.  &quot; You  want to get rid ofyour commander ?   Very good, that  is  your affair  ; but  tell  me,  brothers, why youdislike him.&quot;   &apos;: He  hit one  man in the face.&quot;   &quot; Dear me, did  he ?  And  when wasthat ? &quot;  &quot; A year ago.&quot;  &quot; Now, whom did  he hit ?&quot;  &quot; He hit Bublikov.&quot;  &quot; Whereis Bubhkov ? &quot;   &quot; Here,&quot; replied the organizer of the whole  affair.   &quot; So he hit  you,
Bublikov ?&quot;   &quot; Yes, he  did.&quot;   &quot; That is  very wrong.   And why did he  hit  you,Bublikov ? &quot;    Bublikov was silent, but some of the men near him smiled.  The Colonel repeatedthe question and asked if anyone knew why Bublikov was hit.  At  last the story cameout.  &quot; It was in  the fighting last July.  The captain  told Bublikov  to go to bring upcartridges,  and Bublikoy  said  &apos; I don&apos;t want  to go,&apos; and then the captain hit him.&quot;&quot; Why did not Bublikov wish to go ?&quot;  &quot;Because the Germans were  firing  heavily.&quot;&quot; Was it necessary for the company to bring up  cartridges ? &quot;   &quot; Yes it was. for therewere very few left.&quot;  &quot; Then Bublikov should have gone to fetch them.&quot;   &quot; Quite right,Mr. Colonel.&quot;   &quot; Then don&apos;t you think the captain should be forgiven, for he was onlythinking of the company being left without cartridges.&quot;  &quot; Quite  right, for  Bublikovshould have fetched them, it being a military duty, but as the firing was heavy he didnot wish to go.&quot;    22. Crying for peace. It is no use appealing to higher feelings which should exist,but do not.   Some days ago a regiment in reserve, near Dvinsk, fell in and  the  menstood with   their  heads  down,  crying,  &quot;Peace, peace!&quot;   Three  members of  theAgitation Section  of the Army Committee arrived in  haste.  Two  of  them  madeeloquent speeches, appealing to the men&apos;s sense of patriotism, but they did not raisetheir heads and only continued their cry.   The third said,  &quot; You want peace, and so doI.&quot;   A few heads  were  raised, and  there were  replies of &quot; Quite right.&quot;  The  menthought they were finding sympathy  in an unexpected  quarter.  &quot; But I wonder,&quot; thespeaker continued, &quot; what peace )7ou want, and whether it is the same sort of peace asI want. I don&apos;t want a peace where the Germans  will  take my land, and the police willcome back and hit me about the head; where my cows  and  my horses will be taken,and I will be  left  a fugitive without home and without bread.  Do  you  want that sortof peace ? &quot;   &quot; No, we don&apos;t! &quot;  &quot; Well, I want a peace where we will all get more land,and we will be able  to live as we like,  and to do as we like, without anyone to order usabout or to interfere with  us,&quot; &amp;c.   This regiment talks no more of peace, but all  thesame there is no evidence that it will do much in the fighting line.                                  CONCLUSIONS.    General  Ruzski pretends to be confident that the  first fight will bring the officersback  to their own  again.  His Chief of Staff says that  the Army will right itself ifthe anti-war party at Petrograd does not get the  upper hand.   General  Radko-Dimitriev pretends to believe that his Army  will be  a  better fighting  machine  in2 months than it  has ever been.  General Dragoinirov  thinks that the only chance is toinfluence the  men by continual propaganda.    I had long talks with two soldier  deputies in the train from Riga to Pskov.   Onefrom the 17th Cavalry Division  was pessimistic.   He said that the mass of the men andmore than half of the soldier delegates were idiots  who understood nothing.   If theGermans were to  attack now he feared they would succeed.    The other was a fine type of Russian peasant.  He had worked in the fields till hewas 17, then  educated himself and had gone to  Petrograd University.   He took partin the movement of 1905 as a Social Revolutionary.   His  opinion  is that in 2 months&apos;time the Russian  soldier will fight as he has never fought beiore.    It is difficult to believe in a wave  of enthusiasm that will arouse the men  to somesense of duty and patriotism.  His country to the Russian peasant  is some  hovel nearthe Volga where he happens to have been born and where  he  knows the Germans  willnever penetrate.  The men of the French Revolutionary armies were conscious patriotscompared  to  the  soldiers of Russia to-day, and  war- was then a less nerve rackingexperience than it is now.    The mistrust which the Socialists  have been careful to  spread between the officersand men has destroyed  the fighting efficiency of most units.  The whole Army hastaken a taste for politics and all its thoughts are directed to the rear.    We have just one chance.  If there was a resounding success somewhere, I believeall this madness would cease and the men would really  fight.   Such a success can onlybe obtained by a great concentration of technical equipment and  by its proper use.The men should not be launched in attack till the chances are 90 per cent, in favour ofa success.                               I have the honour to  be, &amp;c,                                    ALFRED KNOX, Brigadier-General,                                                             Military Attache.
