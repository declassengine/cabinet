                    OFFICIAL PRESS  BUREAU,                        WHITEHALL,  S.W.                                 31st May 1917.COlHiTDENTIAL.Sir,     Since the outbreak of war it has been the practice of Govern-neat Departments to ask the Press Bureau to issue Private and Con-fidential instructions to the Press warning them of dangerous sub-jects to which no public reference should be made without submis-sion to the Press.Bureau.     To this date,  564 such Notices have been issued;  each has beenmarked Private and Confidential,  and we have assumed that the Presscould be relied upon to respect the confidence which was necessarilyplaced in them,  and would refrain from publishing the  fact thatthese confidential instructions had been issued.   There have been afew cases where it was evident that Members of Parliament had beenput in possession of Confidential Press Bureau Notices, but it was             ^          fromnot possible to ascertain/where they had obtained them.   On the26th May, at the instance of the  Admiralty and the foreign Office,a Confidential warning was issued to the Press about the movementsof Mr. A. J. Balfour and the members of his Mission.  The next daythe &quot;Star&quot;, in a leading article, disclosed the fact that thiswarning had been given,  and thereby gave marked publicity to thevery matter to which it was most  undesirable,  for the  safety ofthe Mission, that the enemy^ attention should be attracted.     The question of the disclosure of the contents of publicdocuments confided to the Press had already been  the subject ofdiscussion,, and the attention of  the Conference of NewspaperProprietors was therefore drawn to the oase of the &quot;Star&quot;.   TheDirectors have to-day received from Sir George Riddell a letter                  (Continued on Page 2).
C01T3TD3NTIALPage 2. informing them that the question had engaged the attention of the - Conference and, after dealing with the case of the &quot;Star&quot;, the latter concludes as follows:-    &quot;While not wishing to justify the &quot;sentences in question, the Conference desire to reaffirm the right &quot;of the Press to comment upon and criticise prohibitions which may &quot;from time to time be issued by the Authorities.  It is, of course, &quot;impossible to exercise that right without referring inferentially &quot;to the D.  Notices which it is desired to impugn&quot;.     The &quot;D. Notices&quot; are the Private and Confidential instructions referred to in this Circular and, having regard to this statement frs&amp;&amp; the Press, we consider it is undesirable to issue similar instructions in future unless public  references to them can be madewithout danger.  In any case the Departments should realise that &apos; the Press have now disclaimed any obligation to refrain from publish-ing the fact that a warning or prohibition has  been communicated to them by this Office,  and marked &quot;Private and Confidential,  Not forPublication&quot;.     We can only assume that the word &quot;reaffirm&quot;,  in Sir GeorgeRiddell*B letter,  is  used in a general sense,for,  as far as ourknowledge goes,  the Press have not, until now,  affirmed the rightto comment upon ihs criticise confidential  instructions  and  prohibitions  issued by the press Bureau and  inferentially to refer tothe fact  of their issue.andWe have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servants,
