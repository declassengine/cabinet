Eighteen Local Committees have been established in theEnglish Building Trades  and preliminary meetings have beenheld at thirty-three other local centres.

In the Paper Making Trade the work-men have now nominated representatives for tho 15 Local Committeesv/hich have been completed on the employers&apos; side for some weeks.A Joint Appeal also has  now been drafted and issued, togetherwith instructions, and it is expected that the Local Committeeswill be in a position to begin work almost immediately.

It has been deemed necessary to reorganise in a materialPATt^cular, the arrangements for the management of Substi-tution, the object being to decentralise the work of Sub-stitution, and to bring the District Trade Commissioners  into           \closer toucli with the work.    Arrangements have therefore  been
-6-    made for each Commissioner to act as Chief Substitution Officer    in his Area, and that the Area Substitution Officers and Sub-    Area Substitution Officers shall come directly under his control.    The Commissioners will be responsible for the efficient organ-    isation of their districts, and for exercising a general super-    vision over the work of the Substitution Officers.   They will    also make recommendations in consultation with the Area Substi-    tution Officers, as to the Areas in which Sub-Area Substitution    Officers are required, and as to persons suitable for appoint-    ment to fill such posts.         The Office of the Chief Commissioner at St. Ermin&apos;s has    been abolished, and the new arrangements will come into effect    as from the 4th day of June.         It Is believed that the new arrangements will make for a    more complete and better method of dealing with this all import-    ant matter.         Applications for appointments as Sub-Area Substitution    Officers under consideration are being referred to the Area                                                4    Commissioner for enquiry and report.
