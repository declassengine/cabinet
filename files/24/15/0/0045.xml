188Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.WEEKLY REPORT ON GREECE. VI.DGW/006.June 5, 1917.  The Venlzelist Attitude towards &quot;Reconciliation&quot;.      Mr Venizelos1 statement to Lord Granville  on May  22  that he  would &quot;regard the ideal of a reconciliation with King  Constantino  as an unpardonable crime against his country&quot; and that &quot;under no  circumstances would he and his friends  consent  to King Constantine  retaining his throne&quot; has now been publicly expressed  to  The Times&apos;  correspondent (Times, May 30) in the  words:  &quot;I reject all  idea of  reconciliation firmly, flatly and finally&quot;.   Mr Venizelos has,  however, not as yet declared against the  idea of keeping  the  monarchy or even the dynasty.  He  told  Lord Granville  that  &quot;he  was prepared to accept the accession of the Crown Prince, faute de  mieux, on condition that immediately upon the conclusion  of -  peace, a Constitutional Assembly be convened, to define the powers  of the Sovereign and the basis of the Constitution&quot;.   In  a  con-  versation with the Italian Republican deputy, Signor Eugenio Chiesa  (reported in The Morning Post this morning),  Mr Venizelos declared  &quot;I am not a Republican;  I am a Democrat&quot;.  It  is not, however,  certain that these monarchist sentiments  represent  Mr  Venizelos1  fixed determination or that  they are necessarily shared by  his  followers.  Mr Averov, Minister of Education  in the Provisional  Government, made a more indefinite statement  to The Times.  &quot;Later, at the war&apos;s end&quot;, he said, &quot;we can hold a  constituent  assembly, at which the people will be able to decide if they  desire a Republican or a Monarchical Government, and in the latter&apos;  case the crown can be offored to a suitable Monarch&quot;.      Coming at such a moment Mr Venizelos&apos; declaration can  only be
                          -2-considered as addressed to the Entente Powers.  It sounds likea public statement of disagreement with their hitherto pursuedpolicy of reconciling Old and New Greece by means of Mr Zaimis -a policy now to be modified considerably by the diplomaticchanges decided on by the Paris and London Conferences and theappointment of M. Jonnart.The Thessalian Question.     Mr Venizelos had already urged on Lord Granville the necessityfor losing no time if the collecting and purchasing of theThessalian harvest is to be effectively controlled by GeneralSarrailTs military posts in Thessaly.  The barley crop was to beharvested by May 20, and the wheat by June 10.  Wires-fromSaloniki (May 30) show that the barley harvest is now in progressand that rumours are being circulated that the local authoritiesare despatching large quantities of the barley to Athens.  Thishas aroused the population&apos;s indignation.  The Royal Commissionfor Food Supplies has been compelled to publish a notice denyingthis despatch of the crop to Attica.Allies&apos; Control of Greece.     The officers whom the Greek Government has now allowed,at the Powers1 demand, to take over the control of Greek ports,posts and telegraphs, police and railways, were to enter on theirduties on June 4.     A more important development of the Allies&apos; control ofGreece will be the duty to be entrusted to General Sarrail ofestablishing military posts in Thessaly to secure control ofthe harvest.  This has presumably already begun, but as yet no,Greek comment has come to hand.
Italy&apos;s Attitude and the Albanian Question.     The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs informed theFrench Ambassador at Rome on May 28 that the Italian Government,not having been consulted as to the new policy at Saloniki,must reserve their  decision in regard thereto and to therepresentations of the Serbian Government.  The informationforwarded to Sir F. Elliot that &quot;Prince George of Serbia isgreatly concerned at the present situation in Greece andparticularly at the political schemes of General Sarraii&quot; isvery curious.  Prince George is alleged to have asked: &quot;If theFrench are allowed to realise their plans for a Greek Republic,what is to become of the Karadjordjevic dynasty?   Serbian policy,like that of Italy, must be opposed to a strong Greece underVenizelos&quot;.   If faithfully reported, Prince George can be express-ing nothing more than his own personal views.  Politically hecounts for nothing in Serbia, and the conclusion from his remarksthat the Serbian dynasty in their own personal interests mightbe willing to abandon their Jugoslav aspirations and throw overthe Serbo-Greek Alliance,of which Mr Venizelos has always beenthe foremost champion, is quite inacceptable.     The Italian Government shows no intention of abandoning itsintransigeant attitude towards Mr Venizelos.  They have refused toendorse or share in the British and French new policy In theBalkans.  Further, they have proceeded at once to stake out theirclaims to Albania.  The inclusion in this Protectorate of NorthernEpirus will  stiffen anti-Italian feeling both in Venizelist andRoyalist Greece,   Mr Venizelos has made various overtures toconciliate Italian feeling, but without success.  The loss ofNorthern Epirus, which v/as provisionally occupied unde*r hisGovernment,  will rouse considerable indignation among his
                            -4-followers.   It is probable that  the anti-Venizelists will exploitagainst him his inevitable acquiescence (even if under formalprotest) in the Italian fait accompli.   It was Mr Skouloudhis1Government  that first admitted the 16 Northern Epirot deputiesto the Greek Chamber on February 17, 1916, on which occasionMr Skouloudhis declared that &quot;the assimilation of the administrationof Northern Epirus with that of  Greece  and the admission ofEpirot deputies to the Greek Chamber  are natural and necessary inview of the impossibility of maintaining martial law;  whilst todefray the  cost of administration taxation is necessary, in whichmatter it was only just that the Epirots should have a voice in theLegislature.  But all this is nowise in conflict with Greece1sdeclaration in 1914, at the time of the reoccupation, when sherecognised  that the question of  Northern Epirus would be definitelysettled in  the final psaoe treaty&quot;.     Italy&apos;s abrupt declaration  and the occupation by Italiantroops of Greek territory as far as the River Kalamas will makeany attempt to relieve the tension between Italians and Greeksmore difficult,  Already the Provisional Government has addressedan official communication to the British and French representativesat Saloniki, complaining of the  ill-treatment of Venizelists bythe Italians in the district occupied by them near Yannina.The Italian move will be doubly  embarrassing to the Venizelistsboth (1) in the treatment of the local  Venizelist population,and (2) in  the way acquiescence  in it will probably be exploitedagainst Venizelos.                                          A.W.A.L.                                            June 5, 1917.
