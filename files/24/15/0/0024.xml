tit    From the attached tabls, which gi^es the  strength  ofthe Allied and enemy forces on the Macedonian front, itwill be seen that the enemy are slightly superior  in rifleand combatant strength to the Allies while the latter  havea ration strength greater by more than 200/000 men.  Thegreat difference between the ration and combatant  strengthof the Allies is accounted for, at any rate as regardsBritish troops, partly by the large amount of military labourwhich is necessary for the upkeep and construction of  roadsand railways, and partly by the largo numbers required asdrivers for mule transport with divisions. With the Britishdivisions the number of transport drivers has hitherto amount-ed to 4,300 men per division as against 1,300 with a divisionin Prance.  Labour and other troops at the base and. on theLinos of Communication include 88,000 British and Frenchtroops.  The enemy finds the labour he requires by forcingthe inhabitants to work for him, and this labour does notappear as part of his strength. Similarly many of the mouthsfed by the Allies in the total shewn as &quot;ration strength1&apos;       theare of / nature of depot troops, or are in hospital, both ofwhich in the case of the enemy are in the interior. It maybe added, however, that we have little information to guideus as to the number of men in the rearward services of theenemy, and it is very doubtful if there is so great a diff-erence between combatant and ration strength as is shownin the Table.

(1)  Struma mouth to the Vardar River - 90 miles.      (2)  Vardar River to Lake Ochrida     - 90 miles.      During the recent offensive, -which has made nomaterial change in the front, the line was held fromright to left as follows :-           The first section by the British Army, of      which all but one mounted brigade have been in      the line during the last month.

     When these moves have been carried out GeneralSarrail will have one French division at Kateriniand 3 &quot;battalions and 4 Cavalry regiments atSerfidze and Kozani, leaving available to hold theline the following:-   5 British Divisions and 1 improvised garrison                                          brigade.   6-g- French Divisions.   1-g- Italian Divisions.   S Russian Brigades.   6 (nominal) Servian Divisions (equivalent to                                    3 Divisions).   2 Greek Divisions.or the equivalent of 19 Divisions.     The Albanian frontier and the Santa Quaranta -Fiorina road are protected by French and Italiandetachments, the French occupying the district Northof Herseg (30 miles south of Lake Malik) and theItalians a line from Yalona through Clissura toHerseg.   The French detachments on this line amountin all to about 3 battalions &apos;and 2 squadrons, whilethe Italians have about 60,000 men in Albania basedon Valona and Santa Quaranta.   There are 13 Austrianbattalions in Albania numbering 9,750 rifles and9,000 Albanian irregulars.     Last month the Bulgarians reinforced theirfront by an additional division, bringing the enemy&apos;sstrength up to the  equivalent of some E3 Divisions,and there only remain in the interior the new moun-tain division in course of formation and a few miseel1-aneous units amounting in all to not more than 15,000                                              rifles.

It is, however, estimated that the enemy could maintain 35divisions  (taking the German division as the unit ofcalculation) on the Macedonian front, and that consequentlythe enemy forces might be increased to the extent of 12more divisions if the troops are available.   The situationcreated by the Russian revolution and the Roumanian debaclelast year would appear to make it possible that these troopscould be found at any time from the Eastern front,  On theother hand we have the fact that since the beginning ofApril the net reduction in the number of German Divisionson the &quot;astern front by transfer to the Vfestern front hasonly amounted to two divisions while the Turks have trans-ferred one division from the Roumanian front to Asia Minorand a second to an unknown destination.  It seems thereforethat the Central Powers are not yet sufficiently certain ofthe position on the Eastern front to risk the removal oflarge numbers of troops,        The Greek Army is distributed as below :-IN THE HOREA.       All the artillery; 20,000 mobilised troops of whomabout 12,000 are infantry, and 80,000 reservists,IN THESSALY.        3 Regiments, consisting of 1,920 rifles withoutmachine-guns, and 35,000 reservists.IN EFIRUS,        1,940 rifles without machine-guns,  and 15,000reservists,IN ATTICA..       3 Regiments, 2,400 rifles and 80,000 reservists.                                                       In
General Staff.2nd June,  1917.     In the event of hostilities taking place in Thecsaly,the energy forces in Thessaly and hpirus vrould at firstconsist of the garrisons in these provinces, together withan incalculable number of reservists.  The total mightat first, not amount to more than 10,000 men, providedthat the Greek Army has not previously left the Morea.    Prom tho above it rill be seen that if therecent French proposal to send 2 divisions to Thessalyand 2 to the Isthmus of Corinth is carried out, theAllied force on the Macedonian front v:ill be reduced.to 16 divisions, many of them very weak, as opposedto 23 enemy divisions which may be greatly reinforced(vide paragraph 3,).
