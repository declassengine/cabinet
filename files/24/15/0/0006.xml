                     From Viceroy, ZOth May 1017.   Private.  Constitutional reforms.  Your  public and  private  telegramsof 22nd May.  I propose to defer formal reply to your official telegram  until1 have received and considered your private letters of  the 2nd and  15th.In the meantime, however, I think it necessary to communicate my views  onthe urgent  epiestion  of  appointing a Committee or  Commission for thepurpose indicated  in  paragraph 5  of your  public telegram.  These  dewshave the concurrence of my Council with the exception of Nair.   2. I assume from your telegrams that you consider further  investigationby a Committee or  Commission necessary, and that it is a settled policy, but1 ask  you to weigh  the following points.   3. If the Commission is  appointed  by  you  and holds its  sittings  inEngland, the views of the Government of India  must inevitably be repre-sented inadequately or go  by default.   No  member of the Government ofIndia could give  evidence in England and proposals would probably  beplaced before the Commission which had been examined and rejected  by usafter  careful consideration.   We  would, however, neither be aware of thisnor able to put our  views before the Commission.  Our Despatch is veryfull,  but it does not  purport to deal  with every possible proposal whichcould be brought forward or with many which were considered and rejected.For instance, the  scheme contained in  a pamphlet  issued by &quot; The Hound Table&quot;  entitled   &quot; Suggestions  for  constitutional  progress  in  Indian polity &quot; was before us, but  we were  unable to accept  it.   We did not, however,  think it  necessary to deal with  its proposals in our Despatch. Again, we  would gladly welcome a  simpler  definition  of goal, but we only arrived at our definition after six months examination and rejection of many alternatives.   If the  Commission  sits  at  home  we  see  great  difficulty in bringing such matters to their notice, and  we apprehend that the reasons upon which  our decisions were based  will not be  represented adequatelybefore them.    4. We feel, on  the other  hand,  for  obvious  reasons,  grave difficulty insuch  a Commission as you  suggest coining  out to India  and subjecting theGovernment of India and its members to an  examination.    5. The appointment  of  a  Commission  of impartial  men would probablymean, I respectfully suggest,  the appointment of men of  definitive politicalviews of some kind, but with  no practical experience of difficulties in India.These men will probably examine many proposals which have  been rejectedby  the Government of India  for practical reasons, and will report perhaps unfavourably, but  perhaps favourably, upon these proposals over our heads ;but their report, by virtue  of special conditions of  their appointment, willcarry a weight out of  all proportion to their knowledge  or experience.    6.  So far I have alluded to difficulties vis-d-vis the Government of India and its members.    I gravely doubt, however, whether a Commission sitting in England will be able to get any evidence of value.  There are few officials in England who are conversant with the present position in  this country. Commission will get evidence from the Congress and various other extreme bodies, but it will be impossible for  it to get witnesses  from conservative classes of India and similar difficulties will &quot;arise in  respect of officials out here  in close touch with the present condition of  affairs.  It is obvious that a knowledge of these  classes is  essential for any satisfactory decision by the Commission on the questions placed before  them,  but  such knowledge will not be obtained.    7. I earnestly urge, therefore, that if  Committee is  to be appointed  it should be a small body  of  officials  and  non-officials to  be  nominated by Government of India  to inquire into the points  referred  to in your public telegram, paragraph 5, and that this Committee should sit in India.  I would
suggest one-third of the Committee, including President, should be selectedby you  from amongst impartial persons of eminence  not connected withadministration of India.  As to remainder of the Committee who  would beselected by the Government of India, I should propose that  one-half shouldbe  Indians.  It would probably be advisable  to  include  a Ruling Chiefamong Indian members, as Native States are vitally interested in politicalprogress  of  British India.   I do not  think  it could be  maintained that aCommittee thus constituted would be subject to undue official influence.   8. The Committee  I  propose would  base  its conclusions  largely  onexisting records, supplementing them when necessary by the private examina-tion of selected  witnesses.   I do not  think  any useful purpose  would beserved by public record of evidence, and such a procedure would  in presentcircumstances certainly evoke acute  racial feeling.  The Committee wouldreport to  the Government of India and wo should, of course,  put before  youour views on their proposals.   : 0. Even  if it  should  be decided  that the  Committee  should hold  itssittings both in England and  in India  1 should  deprecate differentiatingbetween  procedure  to  be followed  in  the two  countries  in the  matter ofrecording evidence.
