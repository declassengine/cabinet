ft \ IJuIntelligence Bureau,Department of Informatien.        WEEKLY REPORT ON FRANCE.11*              June 7, 1917.    The dominant fact of the week in Prance is M. Ribofs  victor-ious re-assertion of the essential war aims of France as  againstall who, whether at Petrograd or at Paris, Wish to treat  them asmatter open for discussion.   The unanimous decision of both Sectionsof the Socialists to go to the Stookholm Conference forced  a diffi-cult decision upon the Government.   There was considerable cogencyin the arguments of M. Caohin and M. Moutet lust  returned from Russiaas to the desirability of explaining French needs and views to theRussians.   But on the other hand the general instinct of France  feltthat for Frenchmen to meet the unrepentant German Socialists wouldbe a surrender of the nation&apos;s honour.   And this feeling was in-creased by the strange language of some of the Socialist  speakersas to the impossibility of deciding who is responsible for  the war.The Socialist decision was, in fact, recognized as a challenge tothe Government.   M. Bibot has shown no hesitation in taking it up.He has refused passports for Petrograd until there is no  danger ofa call at Stockholm involving meetings between Frenoh Socialists  andSerman.   And, what is very significant, his refusal was  very wellreceived by all parties in the Chamber except the extreme Left, and,tfter the secret debate which followed on the demand of M.  Cachin,i Ribot carried the resolution containing his declaration  of policy&amp;y 453 to 53.   He failed, indeed, to obtain the  unanimous  vote forfolch he pleaded;   but the extent of his triumph is shown  by thesmall numbers of the Minority, which was exclusively composed of
ialists and  did not  include much more  than half of them.  It  is undoubtedly  a great personal victory for IU  Ribot,  and, the  moment  at least, perhaps  for more than the moment,  a victoryo for his Ministry,  and  the much criticized Parliamentary worldch he and it represent.   What doeB it mean?   And is it possiblesee what the speeches and their success may lead to  at home oroad?  It  seems to indicate that the rumours alluded to last week,ugh widely prevalent, were considerably exaggerated.    They sug-ted the probability  of disturbances in the streets,  the liklihooda Presidential crisis, and the possibility of still  more seriousrigs.   The submission of the more moderate Majority Socialists to Minority seemed to  confirm the view that  extreme counsels werening  the upper hand  in the Labour world.    But it must be saidt the events of the  last week  do not confirm alarmist views eitherto the temper of the people or as to the weakness of the Govern-t.    It is very difficult, of  course,  and  never so difficult aswar-time when the  press  is censored, to tell what the peopleerneath the  surface  are  really thinking, or even planning.    Theours  alluded to were sufficiently widespread to make it impossibledismiss them as having no foundation at all.    Unrest there un-btedly is, but political rumour is even less trustworthy in Parisn in  London, and the history of Paris  has  given it a tendency tomuch  more credulous  and  nervous about  popular risings than London   And there are in  Paris certain politicians out of office who not  disinclined to  encourage  theeo rumours or even  to set themng.   Meanwhile all  one  can say is that the facts that the numer- strikes which have  occurred in Prance have,  so far  as is known, to little disturbance of the  peace, and that they have now been the  most part amicably  settled, do not suggest a dangerous
situation.   Nor will even those Englishmen who disagree with  thedecision to refuse the passports pretend that it is one which  indi-cates weakness in the Government.   It certainly required  courage;and the courage, which risked offending the Russian Government aswell as a powerful party at home, does not look like what  Oould comefrom a Government conscious of being weak and discredited.   Nor doesIf. Ribot&apos;s tone about rumours affecting the President suggest  thateither he or the President had anything either to fear or  to conoeal.The promised publication of the Russian treaties and other documentswill presumably dispose finally of these rumours so far as they re-ferred to relations with the deposed Emperor Nicholas, though  theysill not prevent other attempts to got rid of M. Poincare.    Do the speeohes and the resolution adopted indicate any change n the foreign policy of the Erench Government?   In the main,  cer-i&amp;inly not.   The re-assertion of the way of victory as the only?ay to peace, of the claim to Alsace Lorraine, to just reparation nd,(in the Order of the day adopted in the Senate),to punishment &apos;or the enemy&apos;s crimes, is as emphatic as ever.   But there are one r two phrases used by M. Ribot which are worth noting - The speeches ontain, of course, nothing that is inconsistent with what has  been aid before but there are some sentences which seem to have been eliberately intended to suggest a change of tone.   They  may,  of ourse, be due merely to a natural wish to gratify the Russians and cho the sentiments of Mr Wilson.   But M. Ribot may also  have  had a his mind the hardening effect on German opinion said to  have been foduoed by previous declarations of war polioy which merely repud- *ted any desire to aim at the destruotion of Germany.   In any case, tetever was in the speaker&apos;s mind, the words he used are  certainly ^nificant.   For instance, in the speech of May 22 he spoke  of the German people whose right of future development we do not  contest-&apos;&quot;.
    In the same speech he spoke of the indemnity required  not  be-iug a war levy imposed upom a conquered enemy as a  punishment buta reparation demanded by justice.    So, in the  Senate  on  June 6,he is reported to have said in speaking of indemnities:   &quot;If itwere a question of humbling the conquered we should not wish tohave anything to do with it.&quot;   And both the declaration  adoptedby the Chamber and VU Ribofs speech in the Senate  welcome  empha-tically the ideals of Mr Wilson and indeed of the Russians  as tothe new order of things which is to guarantee the future  peace.The declaration speaks of &quot;obtaining lasting guarantees of  peaceand independence for peoples great and small in the already pre-pared organization of a society of Nations&quot;.    M. Ribot,  in theSenate on June 6th, is said to have used even stronger words.&quot;Our best guarantee will be in the formation of a Europe  in whichall nations belong to themselves&quot;.   The Allies, he adds, will  notseparate after victory but will &quot;form a leaque  of peace in  thename of the democratic spirit which Prance had  the  honour of intro-ducing into the world.   We nations in arms will form  a societyof nations&quot;.   In this league or society, he explains, &quot;all nationswhich are not nations of prey&quot; are to join.    Such phrases as these are obviously partly intended  to appeasethe disappointed French Socialists, to gratify  Mr Wilson  and tomeet the susceptibilities of the Russian Revolutionary Government.But may they not also possibly be more than that?   May not M.  Ri-bot have had also in view that probably increasing  section  ofGerman opinion which intensely desires peace but is led by  itsGovernment to believe that the only peace the Allies would  acceptis the annihilation of Germany?   May he not have desired to con-tradict the German Government so far as his words can  reach Ger-s&amp;n ears, and to show that Prance desires security  but not  ven-
 geance, and that though she must demand a penalty of some sort she is not asking for anything like a sentence of death but rath- er for something more in the nature of damages for injury sus- tained?   May he not, in fact, have used the opportunity given him by Russian and Socialist pressure to endeavour to add a political to the military blows struck by the allied armies at the &quot;holding out&quot; temper so earnestly fostered by the German Government?     There does not seem much else in the French situation re- quiring comment.   A Bill granting the &quot;English week&quot; (that is a Saturday half-holiday) to some half a million workwomen has been passed by the ISBXXKX Chamber.   A proposal to extend the concession to all workmen and workv/omen was rejected.   The Bill is an enforcement by law of agreements made by organiza- tions of employers and employed.    This is apparently the first time this principle will have appeared in the French Statute Book;    and the new departure is resented by some papers asan invasion of liberty.     The scarcity of supplies, especially of coal, continues to arouse attention.    A system of distribution of coal, locally, under the direction of the Prefects,  has been an-nounced by the Minister of Supply.                                                    J.C.B.
