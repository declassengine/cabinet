  SECRET.                             Intelligence Bureau,                                  Department of Information,                                           BV/A/004.          Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary*  IV.                   (9th June,  1917.)     The news available from Austria since the opening of theReichsrat does not as yet furnish the material for any addquatesummary of events.   As was pointei out last week, the speechfrom the Throne- and its reference to the need for  &quot;expanding  theconstitution&quot; is capable of tv/o interpretations -  either in thedirection of a moderate federalism or of greater centralism.    Thecomments in the Austrian and German press, as also the attitudeof the various Slav groups, show that -it has been  generally inter-preted in the latter sense.     The German parties on the one hand and the four Slav groups,Czechsi Poles, Southern Slavs and Ukrainians on the other - withthe smaller group of Italians and Roumanians standing s 1ittleapart - are watching each other with open hostility, an* there isno sign ov; concession anywhere, though it is still too soon tosay wheth&amp;r the government may not find means of appeasing thePoles.     -The Slav deputies had from the first been alienated by thegovernment1 s refusal to allow the numerous Slav leaders who havebeen condemned for political offences to take their seats.    In-deed the authorities only three days before the opening ofParliament joined proceedings against Hr. Klofac,  the CzechRadical leader.   (He had been in prison for nearly three yearswithout trial.)   As a reply to this action he has been elected
Chairman of the Czech Radicals,  and the  Slav parties and theSocialists are expected to make  trouble  if he is not released^or at least transferred from  military to civil jurisdiction.   TheVienna correspondent of the frankfurter  Zeitung refers to thechilling silence in which the Slav deputies received tributesto the late liimperor and to the army,  and remarks upon the curiouBindifference shotm by the population towards the summons ofParliament.     The pronouncement of Hr. Stanek in  the name of the iirholeCzech Club in favour of the Bohemian constitution and of Czecho-Slovak union v/as followed by  a speech of the Czech Radical,  Mr.Kalina, repudiating on the part  of the Czechs all responsibilityfor the war, attacking the &quot;so-called constitution&quot;, greeting&quot;with boundless admiration and enthusiasm&quot; the liberation of theRussian people, and declaring &quot;solemnly  before the whole worldthe Czech people&apos;s will to freedom and independence&quot;.     The correspondent of the Mttnchen ffeueste xTachrichten (theleading Bavarian organ) is allowed to inform his readers that thetext of the Czech pronouncement  v/as couched - presumablydeliberately - in language similar to that used by President\7ilson and that Count Clam-Mart in ic had  a few days earlierattempted to induce the Czech leaders to refrain from such ademonstration, but without success.     The Pan-German deputy, Kerr Pachor, promptly announced in thename of all the German deputies  their strong opposition to anyrestoration of the Bohemian constitution, which they regard asobsolete.   Professor Kmety,  the leading Magyar authority onconstitutional law, has written  to the Press denouncing the in-clusion of the Slovaks in the Czech claims,as an unfriendly actto Hungary.   It is unnecessary  to point out that every Magyarwould resist such a breach in the  integrity of the Hungarian State
as! the. union of Czechs and Slovaks would involve.     That open collisions between the rival r^ecs  and partieshave, hithe to boon avoided is probably due to the  fact that allarc marking time until the statement of the Premier,  which wasexpected yesterday.     In the meantime a parliamentary committee is  debating theproposed reform of the Standing Orders of the House,  but it is toosoon aSrjet to foresee whether this reform will work out in thedirection of weakening Slav powers of obstruction, or indeedwhether there, v/ill be any reform whatever.   The only surpriseof the week has been the adoption by a majority of a proposalthat tho speeches delivered in non-German languages shall bereported verbatim in the parliamentary &quot;Hansard&quot;.    (jSvery memberhas tho right to speak in his own language but only v/hat is saidin German has hitherto been reported officially.)    That this hasbeen carried is evidently due to the Polish Club having gone intoopposition, which puts the Germans in a minority.     Peace ,Talk.   On the 26th and 27th May the leue Freie Presseand Pester Lloyd published inspired articles on &quot;The War-Aimsof the Dual Monarchy&quot;.   After general professions that no one inAustria-Hungary desires to make peace &quot;dependent on the acquisitionof foreign soil&quot;, the main stress was laid upon the need for thefreedom of the Adriatic and the Danube for shipping.    This isdefined in three concrete directions: (l)   &quot;SFever can we giveup our Gibraltar lovean&quot; (the Montenegrin mountain which commandsthe naval base of Cattaro).   (2)  &quot;Serbia and Rumania have lostthe right to be tho guardians of the Danube&quot;, and complete economicguarantees must be found for Austria-Hungary at their expense.(3)  &apos; Albania must be independent.   All these articles have adistinctly &quot;Central European&quot; flavour.   In this connection maybe quoted Count Clam-Martinic1s assurance to a Ukrainian deputation
 that there v/as no idea of ceding Eastern Galicia os Bukovina toRussia.     The Czech Socialist pa*$y appointed three delegates toStockholm,, but these have not been given passports by the Austriangovernment.   The party nov.- publicly protests against the twoindividuals who have gone there in the name of the Czech Socialists,Burian and Stein, and denounces them as &quot;oorrupt emissaries of theAustrian government&quot;.     The full reports of the trial of l?riedrich Adler whoassassinated the Austrian Premier, Count Stflrgkh, are nov; to handand explain the profound impression produced in Austria and Germanyby his defence.   The light Which it throws upon Austrian politicalpsychology and also upon the outlook of Austrian and even GermanSocialists makes it a matter of regret that it should have passedalmost unnoticed by the British Press.     In the Hungarian crisis there has been a prolonged deadlock.Count Andrassy appears to have failed to form a cabinet, mainlyowing to the fact that Count Tisza1s party has closed its ranksbehing its chief, and not deserted him in favour of Andrassy,Apponyi and other opposition leaders, as it did 12 years ago undersimilar circumstances.   The result has been that the Emperor-King has had to-fall back upon Baron Burian, who after being JointFinance Kinister for a number of years,  succeeded Count T&amp;erchtoldas Foreign Minister and v/as so abruptly  replaced by Count Czerninlast December.   Baron Burian is chiefly known as the alter egoand nominee of Count Tisza, and if hie appointment as HungarianPremier should be confirmed, it would mean that the Crown had beenforced, for lack of adequate support elsev/here to submit  to agovernment controlled by Tisza from the  background, and had merelysucceeded in saving its face by eliminating that statesman fromactual office.   A possible alternative  is the selection  of
                                                               rj r*j r                                                               i idR.Y/.S.W.Dr.  /okiirle as a compromise candidate.     It is announced that -the smaller Independence group led byCount Karolyi has hold a joint nee-ting \.-ith the Democratic,Social-Democratic and Radical parties, for the purpose of startinga joint suffrage club.   The club&apos;s aims are (l) a proper electoralreform, (2) &quot;Peace without annexations and indemnities&quot; and (5)International agreement.   If the very doubtful rumour that otheropposition parties may join them be true, then there is some hopethat the movement may lead to concrete results: but it is necessaryto remember that the Karolyi party is much the weakest, of theexisting parliamentary groups; that the Democratic party hardlyhas any roots outside the Jev/ish bourgeoisie of Budapest itself,that the Socialists are not a real force in so predominantlyagrarian a State as Hungary, and that the Radicals, though theirleaders - Oszkar Jaszi and others - are the very cream of theMagyar intellectuals and will play a great part in the democraticHungary of the future, are absolutely unrepresented under thepresent franchise.
