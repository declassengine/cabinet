SECRET.OPERATIONS.From:-  General Barter.To r -C . I. G. S .  June 4th, 1917.Handed in 6.20 p.m.1070.  Alexeieff received instructions from Petrograd lastnight to hand over Command-in-Chief to Brusilov and toproceed to Petrograd at the disposal of Government.  I aminformed that he replied that he desired to retire intoprivate life if his services were no longer required forthe public good.   The date of his departure is not known,probably that of Brusilov&apos;s arrival.       The reason for his removal is apparently purelypolitical, as he has always disclaimed association withany but military action.   He has persistently assumed anenergetic attitude in regard to matters of discipline andexemplary punishment, which seems to have gene further thanwas convenient for the Government to support.       The officers&apos; conference, which has been sitting herefor the last two weeks, was dissolved to-day withoutachieving much as regards relations between officers andmene  The attitude of the latter was sullenly hostile atthe meeting this morning.  The C.G.SGeneral Denikin,in an impassioned speech uttered no doubt with full resentmentat Alexeieff&apos;s dismissal, made a fine appeal to officersto do their duty no matter under what circumstances.  Hisaddress, however, contained allusions tc revolution whichwill probably lead to his immediate removal, in addition towhich it is known that he is not on good terms with Brusilov.       During the week there has been an impression ofgradual improvement in the army, but to-day this opinion isagain more pessimistic, partly owing to information justreceived that propaganda which is being carried out onRoumanian front by the delegates of Black Sea fleet has notbeen as successful as was expected.  It is reported thatthese delegates were fired on at one point when leaving thetrenches.                                              *
