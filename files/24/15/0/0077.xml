The Advisory Committee on Poultry Questions referred to inlast  week*s reoort will have its first meeting on Friday the 8thinstant,   The&apos;terms of reference are as follows:-        &quot;To consider and report upon technical  questions of poultrymanagement and feeding, both&quot;in general and in detail, and  on generalquestions of the  organisation  of the poultry  industry, with a view tosecuring that the readjustment of the industry to war conditionsshall be made in  the most approved manner.&quot;         The question whether the Boardfs scheme for distributingsittings of eggs  should be continued for the  season 1917-18 or not isalso  referred to  the Committee,                          Statistical,Branch,          The returns of live stock on 21st  April 1917  have beentabulated,  and comparisons with the data for the 4th June  1916indicate that dairy cattle are now more numerous than then.   Forother classes of stock,  comparison is hardly possible,  but nochange was revealed that was not probably referable to  thedifference in date of the two enumerations.          The Konthly Agricultural Report (to be issued on Friday)indicates that the barley area in England and ^&quot;ales is  about thesame as in 1916;  the oat area 8 or 9 per cent,  higher, the potatoarea about 10 per cent,  higher,  hops 40 per  cent, lower,  (about  halfthe 1914 area),  and the  probable hay area slightly less than, lastyear.   The yield of hay per acre - both clover  and grass  - isexpected to be just equal to average.   The  condition of wheat isonly moderate, but barley,  oats,  potatoes and mangolds  (where theplant is above ground) are generally quite satisfactory.    Fruit ofall kinds promises to be abundantcPrices of cattle shew a considerable rise this week.Diseases of Animals Branch,S-ine Fever.
