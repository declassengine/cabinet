                                            Department of Information.C                      SECTION  C.                    CRV7/0Q7.             WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA, VII.                     June 4, 1917.    Mr Kerenski at the Front.         During the last week the centre of interest has been    transferred from Petrograd to the front where Mr Kerenski&apos;s pro-    gress has been followed with the greatest interest.  The conflict    that arose in the first days of May and led to the resignations    of Messrs Milyukov and Guchkov was political in character, but its    effects were felt among the troops both at the front and in the    rear.  In forming the Coalition Government it was realised that    the strongest man would have to take charge of the Army and Navy4    and immediately Mr Kerenski was appointed he set to work with his    characteristic vigour.  His speeches all along the front have had    an enthusiastic reception and he Is daily being recognised as the    real leader of the revolutionary movement.         It v/as inevitable that as soon as Mr Kerenski showed himself    determined on constructive as well as destructive work the extreme    agitators would denounce him.  Their task, however, is not an    easy one, as Mr Kerenski&apos;s past career has been singularly    consistent and since the Revolution he has not shown the slightest    sign of opportunism.   While in the Government he has never changed    his views about war aims;  at the same time he has waited for and    seized upon the moment when he considered the work of destruction    must cease.  His present attitude is summed up in the words of his    recent speech at Odessa:-  &quot;The time for destruction is past.  ItC   is easy to criticise, easy to destroy, but it is not this that    the Russian Revolution demands&quot;.
                               -2-   Attitude of Political Parties-        Since the Revolution the only &quot;bourgeois party that haB  found   itself  strong enough to  stand up against  the extreme  Left  has  been   that  of the Cadets, although there have been strong differences   within  the party, Mr Nekrasov leading  the more  Radical group as   against those who follow Mr Milyukov.  Attempts are now being  made   by Mr Guchkov to form a  nev/ Octobrist  party which will be  strongly   Republican and able to break away from the  old  associations  of the   Octobrist party  that allied itself with Stolypin some years  ago.   Since the Revolution the Octobrists  and the Cadets have been work-   ing very closely together.  For example,  at the elections  for  the   Municipal Council in Moscow, the Octobrists decided not to put   forward a candidate of their own, but  to  vote for the Cadet   candidate.  Most of1 the  industrialists in Moscow are  also  support-   ing the Cadets.        To the left of the  Cadets  the  only existing political parties   are Socialist, though it is not unlikely  that a new Radical  party -   perhaps led by Mr Wekrasov  - may come  into  existence. At  present   the Socialist parties are making efforts  towards union  - with  the   exception of the Bolshevik! or  Maximalists  who  are extreme        *   doctrinaires.  The  Social Revolutionaries now combined with  the   Trudoviki  (the party led by Mr  Kerenski in  the  Duma)  are working   for union with the  moderate Social  Democrats,   As both are support-   ing the Coalition Government and as both  agree  on the question of   war aims, there  seems no reason why they  should not work more  and   more  closely  together.        The  influence  of the Maximalists  led by Lenin need not  be   exaggerated.  Lenin has  not had great  success.   Though his violenceC  appeals to  a  certain extent to  an  excited mob,  he is  far too   doctrinaire for  the masses.  He and his  followers have, however,
now organised a campaign among the soldiers at the front andpublish a paper called Soldatskaya Pravda (Soldiers1 Truth) topreach the &quot;truth&quot; at the front in the same way as Pravda doesin Petrograd.   As the hulk of the soldiers are peasants Lenin&apos;s&quot;truth&quot; for the soldiers advises the election in every villageof a Council of Peasant and Labour Deputies.  The soldiers, hesays, must help in this, as the peasants will only get the landwith the help of the soldiers.War Aims.     A great deal has appeared in the Socialist press on the sub-ject of  no annexations or indemnities and the right of nationsto decide their own fate&quot;.  Much of what is written is prettyvague.  A Petrograd paper which includes Mr Kerenski cn its listof collaborators has written strongly against Italian claims tothe &quot;Coast of Dalmatia inhabited by Slavs&quot;.     Chernov, the new Minister of Agriculture, has been upholdingthe cry of &quot;peace without victory&quot; and has quoted President Wilsonin support of his ideas.  If President Wilson1s Note to Russiagives a new interpretation of his speech delivered before Americacame into the war, it will help to defeat one of the main argumentof the pacifists.  Chernov does not preach sentimental pacifismin the style of Maxim Gorki;  his formula &quot;peace without victory&quot;is based on the argument that only partial victories in the field                                                        *       )are possible, that the real victory must come from a movementagainst the Hohenzollerns and Habsburgs within the enemy countriesIn order to bring about such a movement he advocates the follow-ing statement of war aims--  &quot;The complete renunciation of thedesire of one side, proud and victorious, to dictate its will
to the other side, humiliated and brought to its knees.  Thecomplete renunciation of the motto vae victis.   Peace noton the basis of military success and the preponderance of merephysical force, but on the basis of right born in the fire ofrevolution, free from hypocrisy and equally just to all&quot;.Land Question.     The land question is still one of the most pressing problemsof internal politics.  Its settlement is necessary both toprevent excesses and to ensure the food supply.  There has beencriticism of the former Provisional Government on the ground thatit was slow in introducing new democratic self-government.The country and district boards were hot revised and numerousdistrict committees were allowed to spring up side by side withtheir powers undefined.  At first the peasants were enthusiasticsupporters of the Provisional Government, but afterwards grewdiscontented.  It is such feelings that Lenin has exploited inhis agitation for the immediate seizure of the land by the peasantsLenin writes as follows;- &quot;v:e advise the peasants to follow thedecision of the majority of the peasants on the spot andimmediately seize all the land, thus increasing the quantity ofbread and meat for the soldiers&quot;.     It appears that in the country districts two distinct bodieshave been formed to settle land questions:- (1) Land Committees(2) Councils of Peasants&apos; Deputies,  These bodies may be said tocorrespond to the Provisional Government and the C.W.B.S.  inPetrograd.  The task of the Land Committees is to settle landdisputes, while the Councils  of Peasants&apos;  Deputies control theiractions and defend the rights of the peasants.
