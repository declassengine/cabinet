[This Document is the  Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1917.  SECRET.G.T.-961 (a).                                                         25      EDUCATION  BILL, 1917              CLAUSE 13.&quot; EMPLOYMENT OF  CHILDREN ACT,  1903.&quot;                        Memorandum by Sir George Cave.    THE President of the Board of Education  has been good enough to send me acopy of a memorandum (G.T. 961) which he is proposing to circulate to the Cabinet onthis subject.   I regret that I cannot agree that a case is made out for transferring  thepowers of the Home Office of confirming employment bye-laws under the Employmentof Children Act to the Board of Education.    The Home Office is the Department concerned with  the protection of children, andadministers the Children Act.   It is also the Department concerned with  the regulationof employment, and has  been supervising  the  employment of children in factories,mines, &amp;c, for three-quarters of a century.  In both capacities it is, in my opinion,  theDepartment  best  fitted for  dealing  with  the bye-laws  made under  section 1  of  theEmployment of Children Act.   The  suggestion that it  is  not  qualified to deal withthese bye-laws is baseless.    The following seem to me  to be strong grounds against transferring the work tothe Board of Education :     1. The bye-laws which have been made under section 1 of the Act include a wide          i-ange  of subjects,  and  are not  concerned  only with safeguarding  the          education of the child.   The health, morals, and  general well-being of  the          children have to be kept in view.   Restriction or prohibition of employment          of children in occupations which are undesirable from the point of -view of          morals, health, or  on other grounds e.g.,  public-houses, billiard saloons,          &amp;c.; regulation of  industrial work at home  (&quot; homework &quot;);  restriction or          prohibition  of Sunday employment; regulation of employment during the          holidays-e.g.,  in farm work ; provision  for meal intervals in the course of          employment;  regulation  of weight-carrying.;  regulation of employment on          the stage, are matters which  are frequently dealt with in  bye-laws, but          have no special,  or only  a secondary, connection with  the school education          of the  child, but  n-hich closely  concern the Home Office in its administra-          tion of the  Children Act and of the Factory Acts.    2. The Home  Office has accepted the  proposal  in the Bill that the authority  for          framing bye-laws should be the  local  education authority, and not the          County, Borough, or  District  Council;  but  if,  in addition to this change,          the Board of Education is also  made the confirming authority, there will be          a  considerable risk that the  matter  will  be  dealt  with purely  as  an          education question, and other equally important considerations ignored.    3. If the powers under  section  1 are  transferred to the Board of Education, an          anomalous position wrill arise as soon as the Home Office is able to get the          contemplated legislation for the regulation of  employment of young persons          over 14 who are not covered by the Factory  and Mines Acts.   The Home          Office would then be confirming bye-laws for young  persons over 14, while          the Board of Education w-ould be confirming bye-laws for children under 14.          Such an arrangement would not be  conducive  to good administration.  Take          the case of shop employment.   A great deal of the employment of children,          both under and  over  14, is in or in  connection with shops.  Numerous          bye-laws have been made  under  the Employment  of Children  Act  to      [703]
2           regulate such employment.   The  hours  and conditions of employment of           children in shops are also partly regulated by the provisions of &quot; The Shops           Act, 1912,&quot; for which the Home Office is the central authority, and these           are likely  to  be extended in the future.   It is obviously most  desirable           that there should not be two  separate authorities dealing with  the same           subject.     It is impossible, in this  matter of child employment as in many other matters, toavoid overlapping between the spheres of two  Departments.  It  is submitted  that  theboundary between education and employment is a better one than between employmentof persons below and employment of persons above some fixed age.     As the memorandum  which has been submitted by the Board of Education to  theCabinet on the subject alleges that the present administration of  the Act is ineffective,I think it necessary to  make the following observations   -     (a.) The Board refer to  information  in their possession as to  the effect of employ-           ment  on education.   They  have  never  placed  this  information  at  the           disposal of  the Home Office, or made any  suggestions  on the subject.  The           Home Office would have welcomed such assistance.     (b.) The exercise of the power of making  bye-laws rests with the local authority           and is not compulsory.  A  local  authority is not required to  submit bye-           laws,  but   when  it  has  submitted  bye-laws  which  the Home  Office           consider insufficient, it  can refuse to proceed with them if the Department           insists on amendments.     (c.) If progress has  not been as rapid as could have been desired  it  must be           remembered that the Act dealt with an almost entirely new subject so  far           as the local authorities  were  concerned, and  I very  much  doubt whether           progress has been less rapid than it commonly is  with  any  new duty which           is placed on the local  authorities.  During  the last three  years, moreover,           progress has been much hindered by the war.   Nevertheless, taking London           and the larger towns, out of a  population  of 20,000,000,  bye-laws under           the Act have been made which cover a population of  16,500,000.     (d.) The question of strengthening and extending the provisions of the Act and of           improving  its  administration  by the local  authorities  was  under  the           consideration of the Home Office before the war.     Two Committees, appointed by the Department one  to consider  the question ofstreet trading, the other to consider the question of the regulation  of  the  employmentof van-boys and Avarehouse boys over school  age, had  recommended further legislation,which the Home Office  proposed to introduce without  delay.     The recommendations of the latter  Committee were of special importance.   Theyrecommended  that  powers  should be given  to  local authorities to  make  bye-laws,subject to confirmation  by the  Home Office, to regulate the hours and conditions ofemployment.   This would involve an extension of the provisions in  section  f  of  theEmployment of Children Act to include young persons  over school age.   There is nodoubt that such powers are wanted.   Employment  of 37oung jjersons above school ageis  regulated  in factories  and workshops, mines and quarries,  but only  partially inshops, and not at all in the numerous other miscellaneous employments in which youngpersons engage.     Further, in order to improve the administration  of the Act by enabling the HomeOffice to exercise a closer supervision of the local  authorities,  the Department hadsubmitted  proposals to  the Chancellor  of the  Exchequer  for  the  institution  ofgrants in aid to local  authorities in respect  of their  work under this Act.  Theseproposals were included in the Finance  Bill of 1914, which had  to be dropped on theou i break of war.     For the  reasons I have set out above I  consider that the  work  should remainwith the Home  Office, and that by co-operation  between the two Departments theinterests of education can be satisfactoryv provided for.                                                        (Initialled)       G. C.     Rome Office, June  13, 1917.
