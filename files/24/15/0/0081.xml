From G.O.C. in C.,

 British Force,

  Salonika.

To D.M.I.

I.1071

General Phillips sends following telegram:-

"Though in my opinion Zaimis has done much and is honestly endeavouring against an ever increasing public hostility to establish order and carry out controllers requests French military control officers are most dissatisfied with him. Incidents have accumulated during the last two weeks and General Cauboue&apos;s letters to Zaimis shown us after request make the most of them and mount in severity and accusations. Two or three French espionage agents who abound and are naturally Venizelist have been assaulted. Search for arms failing in most cases and resistance on these two occasions is exciting the public. The Venizelist and Royalists are bordering on panic. It is possible that in the general uncertainty of the situation revolt of Royalists against Venizelists in fancied defence of their King may occur at any time and require considerable force to quell. I do not believe any concerted action will be taken against the Entente".
