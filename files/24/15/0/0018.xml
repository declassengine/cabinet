Situation remains  normal and  quiet.  America&apos;s entry into the war has apparently had considerable moral  effect.     Alarming rumour regarding critical condition of Amir&apos;s health circulated  through  India  and Afghanistan end of  April.  Amir,  however, was  only  suffering from acute attack  of  gout and recovered sufficiently to travel from  Jalalabad to Kabul middle of May.
