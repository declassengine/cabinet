SECRET.MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending  Wednesday,  June  6, 1917.                        PARTI  I. ACTION  TAKEN.             ORDER UNDER  THE DEFENCE  OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.    The Meat (Sales)  Order, 1917, dated  May  31, 1917, regulates  the  sales of fatcattle and of dead meat as follows :     (1) A dealer in fat cattle may re-sell  only to  a  person  who  gives  a written          undertaking that he is buying for purposes of  slaughter, and  the cattle          so  bought  must  be slaughtered within 14  days from the  date of  sale.          The undertaking must be entered in the books of the market authority at          or nearest to the place of sale, and the fact  of slaughter must be notified          to such authority and recorded  by them.   The term &quot; cattle&quot; includes          rams, ewes, wethers, lambs, and swine.  This part of the  Order comes          into operation on June 11.    (2) A salesman of dead  meat may sell only to a retail butcher or to a  consumer.          If he sells  a carcase, side, or  quarter, he may only charge 3d. a stone          above the price at which he bought, but  he may charge a further Id a          stone if he cuts  the meat into smaller joints.  Meat importers can only          charge Id.  a stone for meat cut  into joints  above  the price charged by          them for carcases sold whole.  Meat imported by the Board  of  Trade and          retail sales of  meat are excepted  from this part of the Order which came          into operation on June 4.   .  The object of this Order was to eliminate, so far  as possible, both as regards livecattle and dead  meat, all unnecessary intermediate transactions between the farmerand the consumer.  When a dealer buys cattle he may take  these cattle to any marketand re-sell  them,  but only to  a  buyer who&quot; gives  an undertaking that he  willslaughter them.  A wholesale butcher may  sell  to an  intermediary distributor, who,in his turn, must only  sell to a  retailer or consumer.     It was  announced in the  Press  on Saturday, June 2,  that  it was intended tosupplement  this  Order by a further Order fixing maximum prices, but that  there weregreat technical difficulties in compiling a schedule of retail prices applicable to thevarying conditions and  trade  practices of different parts of  the country. It  wasintimated (1) that the  dressed carcase as sold in  the open market would probably betaken as the basis of price control;  (2) that  maximum prices per cwt. would be. fixedfor animals purchased for Army requirements with a  view to regulating the prices to be paid to the farmer  by dealers and butchers ; (3) that it was proposed  to securethe regulation of retail prices by a system of licences  which could be extended fromtime  to time  to any foodstuffs in  regard to which  it&apos;  might  be found necessary toexercise more direct control.                        CONTROL  OF SUPPLIES AND PRICES.     Export of Foodstuffs from  America. A cable  was received from Mr. Hoover suggesting  that some public expression in this country of  anxiety as  to futile American supplies might  facilitate  American  food legislation.   Captain Bathurst thereupon stated, in  reply to  a  question in &quot;the House of  Commons, that  it was of great importance to the success of the Allied cause that the export of foodstuffs from America should  be on the highest possible scale for the remainder of the war. - - -     A (33)3203-1  Pk 1  50  6/17  B &amp; S                         -                  A
2    Grain and  Potato Crops. The  Committee  appointed to  advise the  Ministry ofFood on questioris relating to the marketing and distribntion of the 1917 crops o grain and potatoes has been constituted as follows : Mr. S. F. Mendl.Mr. Hugh Rathbone.Mr. George Walter Roffey.Mr. William Soundy.Mr. Arthur  C. Sadd.Mr. B. EL Smith.Mr. W. A. Smith.The Hon. E.  G. Strutt.Mr. A. E. K. Wherry.    Mr. Anker Simmons (Chairman).    Professor R. Biff en.    Mr. Alfred Bovill.    Mr. J. H.  Campbell.    Mr. Thos.  Darling.    Mr. John W. Dennis.    Mr. Samuel  Farmer.    Mr. Charles  B. Fisher.    Captain  R. B. Greig.    Mr. Harry Hope, M.P.    The Committee has begun work.    In view of an intimation from the Board of Agriculture that owing to shortage oflabour a difficulty was  being found in lifting  the  Jersey potato crop, a request hasbeen conveyed to the Departments concerned for the employment of additional enemyprisoners and for the temporary release of islanders liable for military service.   TheHome Office have taken immediate steps to place  a number of Austrian prisoners atthe service of the Jersey authorities.  The crop is  estimated  at 60,000 tons, of which25,000 will be reserved for Army requirements.    As there appears to be a  considerable surplus of potatoes in Ireland, permissionhas been  given for the service of potatoes in Irish public eating-places, notwith-standing Article 2 of the Public Meals Order, 1917.    Flour Mills Control. In order to  check the undue profits which are reported tobe made in the re-selling of offals  by dealers, it has been  decided to publish everyweek in the local  press the prices at which offals should be obtainable in each district.    The calling up for militarj7 service of men employed in mills threatens unduly toaffect the milling industry,  and  representations are being made to the War Office forthe purpose of securing  exemptions for such men as are considered indispensable.    Complaints have been  received  that owing to the warm  weather the increasedextraction of flour and admixture of permitted  cereals is causing bread  to  be affectedby a disease called &quot; rope.&quot;   The Food Inspection Department at the Local GovernmentBoard have been asked to report  on the&apos; matter, and  the Food (War) Committee  arealso investigating the subject.                     FOOD CONTROL IN MUNITION CANTEENS.    The provisions of  the Public  Meals Order,  1917,  do  not apply to munitioncanteens.  The Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) as the  department entrustedwith the organisation of canteens  for munition and transport workers have, with  theconcurrence of the Food Controller and  the  Minister of Munitions, prepared  andcirculated instructions for the guidance  of those responsible  for the management ofsuch canteens as to the course to be followed in the present period of food shortage.    These instructions suggest the general observance of rations in accordance withthe scale of allowances prescribed by the Public Meals Order, with such variations asmay seem desirable having regard  to  the nature  of  the  work done, which may beheavy manual work, medium work, or. light sedentary  work.  The circular furtherdeals with restrictions on the consumption of bread, and  the prevention of  waste, andlays great stress upon the provision and service of attractive meals.                                 FOOD ECONOMY.    Marked decreases in the consumption of bread and flour are reported from manycentres, particularly in the  South of England.   Portsmouth,  for instance, reports thatcomparing the  week ending June 2nd with that ending  May  19th, the  returnsfurnished by the bakers show a decrease of 219 sacks  of flour, which is equivalent to78,840 lbs. of bread.   The Medical  Officer  of Health for Portsmouth estimates thepopulation at 230,000, and  on this basis the  consumption of bread  at present standsat  3 lbs. 1 oz. per head per week.     Other places reporting  marked decreases  are, Southampton, Andover, Alresford,Alton, St. Aibans, Crowborough, Westbury, Ipswich and Hartlepool.    Up to and including May 31st, Central Kitchens had either actually been openedor were definitely in preparation in 140 boroughs, and Food Economy Exhibitions hadbeen  arranged in 123 districts.
    The Lord Provost of  Edinburgh reports that economical cookery lectures anddemonstrations in that city have been attended by some 10,000 working-class women.The Manager Of  the  Glasgow Tramways has distributed 200,000 special leaflets inone week.    A weekly educational journal  devoted a  whole  issue to Food Economy, andschools in many areas are observing a  Food Econonry week when lessons to theschool children are based on the need for the continued exercise of economy in the useof food, particularly of bread.                           ENFORCEMENT  OF ORDERS.    The inspectors at the Ministry have been busy throughout the week interviewingofficials of local  authorities and police officers, and there is evidence  that the duty ofenforcing Orders is now being performed more energetically.  There has been somediminution of the number  of complaints  received at the Ministry, which may be dueeither to there now being less ground for complaint  or  to information being commu-nicated to the local  authorities and the local police  in  compliance with  the  pressnotice on the subject.    There have  been numerous prosecutions for waste of bread and fairly heavypenalties have been imposed.  In one case  a man was fined 501., with the alternativeof two months&apos; imprisonment, for feeding  pigs with bread made of wheaten  flour,while the man who  supplied  him  with the bread was  fined 10L, or one month&apos;simprisonment.  Several cases  of  waste of bread stuffs have been  notified by theNational War Savings Committee, whose correspondents are most useful in commu-nicating such information.    The administration of the Potato Orders has been greatly simplified now thatthe Orders regarding seed  potatoes have  expired,  but  against the advantage gainedon this side must be  set  the difficulties created by the entry  into the market offoreign-grown potatoes  of the 1916 crop.    Prosecutions for  contraventions of the Food (Conditions of Sale) Order are beinginstituted by the police all  over the country,  and these cases have been well advertised.There have been two  successful prosecutions under the Food Hoarding Order -one atSouthport, where the defendant was  fined  25Z.,  and the other in Dublin, where thedefendants, wholesale sugar merchants, were convicted of selling 2 cwt. of sugar to afarmer, and  though fined only Is., had to pay 10Z. costs.                PART II.-SUMMARY  OF  FOOD  POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    Imports of food  during the week  ended 2nd June, though not reaching the  highlevel of the three preceding weeks, were greater  than in any week of April or March1917, and 11 per  cent, above  the weekly  average since the beginning of the  year.The total quantity of the  principal  foods and  feeding stuffs received  (as shown inTable A) amounted to 231,000 tons, compared with 286,000 tons in the previous week,252,000 tons in the corresponding week of 1916,  and a weekly average of 207,500 tonsin the five completed months of 1917.    The decrease as compared, with the preceding week is due almost  wholly  toreductions in the imports of wheat (111,500 tons, compared with 159,400 tons in theprevious week) and sugar  (19,700 tons,  against 32,500 tons in the previous week).The imports of  these commodities,  however, were  exceptionally large in  the weekended 26th  May,  and in  the  case  of wheat the reduced quantity  received in thefollowing week was almost equal to that  of  the corresponding week of 1916 (112,500tons), and considerably above the average for this year  (98,000 tons).  The combinedimports&apos;of sugar and glucose, also, were equal to this  year&apos;s average, though muchlower than  in the corresponding week of  1916.  Among.the other  articles includedin the table, the  imports of flour, cheese, and oats were also, above  the average, butthose of mutton,  lard, and margarine were relatively small.    The. total imports of fifteen, of the  principal foods and  feeding-stuffs  since thebeginning of the year now  amount to  rather  more than 4,565,000 tons, compared  withnearly 5,023,000, tons in the corresponding period  of  1916, showing  a reduction ofover 457,000 tons or about 9 per cent.  The articles showing the greatest decreasesare sugar (182,000 tons), barley. (178,000 tons),  wheat. (116,00.0 tons), oats (112,000tons), and wheaten flour (49,000. tons). . The -total, imports of  beef, mutton, hams, andmargarine are also considerably below those for the corresponding period of last year.                                                                        A 2
&quot;On-the other hand, the imports  of maize are  greater by 199,000 tons, and  there aresubstantial increases in the imports of lard, cheese, and butter.                        CONSUMPTION  OF MEAT AND  BREAD.     ]tfeat, The supplies of  dead meat entering the markets at London, Manchester,Liverpool, and Glasgow, (Table  B), in the week ended 26th May, were 10  per  cent,o-reater than those of the preceding week  or of  the corresponding week of 19.16.They were also higher than in any week since the 21st April.   As compared with thecorresponding week of 1916, there were substantial increases (ranging from 5 per cent.in Manchester to 17 per cent in Glasgow) at each of  the individual markets ;  but theincrease on the week ended 19th May was wholly in London, the figures for Manchesterand Liverpool showing slight decreases and those for Glasgow showing a reduction of12 per cent.  Some part of  the increase compared with last year may probably beascribed to the influence of the  Whitsun holiday.     For the four weeks ended 26th May, the average supplies  were 8 per cent, belowthose of April, 1917, or May, 1916.     In the week ended 2nd June, the supplies in London reverted to  about the samelevel as in the week ended 19th May, and  were  b\ per cent, below those of thecorresponding week of 1916.     The supplies of fat cattle received at 51 markets in the United Kingdom, duringthe  week ended  30th May (Table C), were 2 per cent, above  those  received in theprevious week and 11 per cent,  greater than the average for the corresponding weekin the three previous years.  There were reductions,  however, in the supplies of fatsheep and pigs, the number of: sheep  received being slightly less than in the previousweek and 18 per cent, less than  the average for the  corresponding weeks of 1914-16,and the figures for fat pigs showing decreases of  13  per cent,  on the previous weekand 6 per cent, on the three years&apos; average.     In the whole of  May the average  weekly  supplies of fat  cattle were somewhatgreater than in April, and considerably  greater than in May, 1914-16 ;  but the suppliesof fat sheep were 5 per cent, less than in April and 17 per  cent, below the average forMay, 1914-16.  The numbers of fat pigs were about  the same as in  April, 1917, and7 per cent, below those of May,  1914-16.     Bread. Returns from 612  bakers as to the quantity of flour used for baking inMay, 1917, as compared with a  month and a. year before, give the following result:                          Period.                        Quantity  of Flour used.                          --                             (Sacks of 280 lb.)        Four weeks ended Mav 26, 1917    -      -      -    182,241        Four weeks ended April 28th, 1917  -      -      -    190,295        Four weeks ended May 27th, 1916   -      -      -    183,847    The figures show a  decrease of about 4 per cent, in consumption during May,1917, as compared with April,  1917, and of nearlv 1 per cent,  as compared withMay, 1916.   &apos;    The figures for April, 1917, which were  given  in the Report for the week ended9th May, showed that the average weekly consumption in that month had been 4 percent, less than in March, but 5 per cent, greater than in April, 1916.     The decrease from  April to May of the present year is therefore practically thesame as that from March to April, and is, perhaps, less than might have been expected,having regard to the warmer weather.   When regard is had  to other circumstances,however, this decrease is satisfactory.     The growing shortage of potatoes and other foodstuffs has to  be made good to alarge extent by the consumption of. bread,  and  thus prevents the demand for breadfrom falling as much as would otherwise have been the case.  It is noteworthy thatwhile April,  1917,  showed an  increase over the corresponding period  of last year,May, 1917, shows a decrease.  Last year, according  to the returns received, the con-sumption  increased from April to May, no doubt owing to shortage  of potatoes ; thisyear, in spite of an even more pronounced shortage, it has decreased.     It should be  pointed out that the returns relate to use  of flour by bakers only.A marked increase or decrease of home-baking would materially affect any conclusionsbased on  them.  Returns as to flour actually delivered by millers for all purposes
are now being received, but  no comparative  figures for  April or for last year areavailable.                                STOCKS OF  CEREALS.     Wheat. The  stocks of wheat (including flour expressed  as wheat) on 4th  Juneare estimated  to have amounted to 1,188,000 tons compared with 1,165,000 tons aweek before, 1,063,000 tons at 1st May, and 1,393,000 tons a year ago.   -     Barley. The stocks on 4th June  are estimated at 363,000 tons,  compared with374,000 tons at 28th May, and 419,000 tons at 1st May.    &apos; Oats.-The stocks at  4th  June are estimated at  224,000 tons, compared with254,000 tons at 28th May, and 392,000 tons at 1st May.    &apos; Maize. The stocks at  4th  June are estimated at  104,000 tons,  compared with113,000 tons a week previously,  and. 148,000 tons at 1st May.                                WHOLESALE  PRICES.     The principal  changes, since the previous week, in the wholesale prices of foodand feeding-stuffs  (Table  D)  are a further  sharp rise  of 16s. per cwt,, (or nearly1-fdL per lb.) in English mutton, substantial increases in sugar, amounting to 6s. 7^d.per cwt. for cubes and 4s. ^\d. to  5s. \\d.  for granulated  sugar, and decreases  of8s. per cwt. in New Zealand butter, 5s. Qd. per cwt. in Danish bacon, 4s. Qd. per cwt.in  Argentine  beef, and 4s. per cwt. in Canadian bacon.. There  were also smalleradvances in the prices of  British barley and English beef, and slight reductions inthose of linseed cake and cotton-seed cake.     As compared with a  month ago; the most striking change is again  the rise inthe price of  English mutton, which amounts  to  52s. per cwt., equivalent to nearlyb\d. per lb.   The principal other changes are increases of 15s. per cwt. in Argentinechilled beef,  10s. per cwt. in  English  beef, and of 4s. 4-^d. to 6s. l\d. per cwt. ingranulated  and cube sugar, and decreases  of 8s, per  cwt.  in New  Zealand butter,51. per ton in Calcutta linseed, and of 3s. Qd. and  4s. per  cwt., respectively, in Danish and Canadian bacon.  There  are also minor increases in the  prices of Danish butter,Irish bacon, and Argentine mutton,  and small reductions in Irish butter, linseed cake,and country &quot; straight run &quot; flour.     The increases  since the  corresponding date in 1916, which affect every  article included in the Table, except  Argentine mutton, are  greatest in the case of palm-kernel cake (163s.  per ton, or 100 per  cent.), linseed cake (170s. per ton,  or 66 per cent.), British oats (21s.  Sd. per 312 lbs.,  or 65 per cent.),  and Calcutta linseed (226s. per ton, or 60 per cent.).  There are also  increases exceeding  50 per cent, in the prices of  maize and  rice,  of 10 to 46 per cent, in those of English cheddar and Canadian cheese, English  mutton, Canadian bacon, and British wheat, 33  to 38 per per cent., in  Egyptian cotton-seed, Danish butter, Irish bacon, and London flour, and 20  to  28 per cent, in the prices of Danish bacon,  British  barley, Irish butter, and palm-kernels.  The increases are smallest in the case of sugar (12 to 14  per  cent.), Argentine chilled beef (15 per cent.), English  beef (16 per cent.), and New Zealand butter (16  per cent.).  The price of Argentine mutton,  the  only article  showing a decrease, is lower by 8s. Qd. per cwt., or 8 per cent.                                  RETAIL PRICES.      In Tables E and F  particulars are given of the  percentage increases in retail food prices during May 1917, together  with comparative figures for various earlier periods since the beginning of the war.      From Table E it will  be seen that the prices of nearly all of  the principal com- modities continued to rise during May, with the result  that the  general  percentage increase over &quot; normal prices in July, 1914,&quot; was  101&apos; 9, compared with 97 &quot;6 a month previously.   The commodity showing  the  greatest increase during  the month was mutton, the cost of which rose  by averages  varying from fd. per lb.  on the cheaper joints of imported  meat to 2d. per lb. for legs of British meat (equivalent  to  16 to 22^ Per cent- of tne pre-war prices).  Beef, both British ,and imported, also rose in price by amounts averaging f d. per lb. (or between 7 and 8 per cent, of the July 1914 prices) for ribs, and \d.  to ftl per lb. (or between 10  and 12 per cent.) for thin flanks. The principal  other increases  (expressed  as  percentages of pre-war prices) were 12 per cent,  in margarine (fci per lb. on the average), 7 per cent, in  eggs  and  sugar, 4i percent,  in tea, 4 per cent, in flour^ and,nearly 3 per cent in bread.   The onlyA 3203-1A 3
reductions  recorded  were in fish  (4 per cent.), butter (3 to 6 per cent.), and  milk(1 per cent.).    For all the principal articles combined,  the average monthly rate of  increaseduring  the war (expressed  as a percentage  of  prices in July,  1914),  has  been asfollows :                                                                  Per-cent.July-December, 1914      -       -       -      -           3/1January-June,  1915        -       -      -      .      -    2&apos;4July-December, 1915      -       -      -      -      -2*1January-June,  1916        -       -      -      -      -    2&quot; 6July-December, 1916      -       -      -      -      -    4*3January, 1917  &apos;           -       -      -      -      -2*0February, 1917    -       -       -      -      -           33March, 1917       -       -       -      -      -      -    2-3April, 1917 -      -       -       -      -      -           3-2May, 1917  -------    4*3                Average for the whole period     -      -    2*9    The increase in May 1917, is thus considerably greater than the monthly averagefor the whole period of the war.  It is  little greater, however, than in May  1916(4*0 per cent.), and less than in May 1915 (6 &quot;3 per cent.), in each  of which monthsthere were also marked advances in meat prices.    The articles showing most increase in price at 1st June 1917, as compared withJuly 1914, are breast of frozen mutton  (181  per cent.), sugar  (178 per cent.), thinflank  of imported beef  (146 per cent.), potatoes (144 per cent.), breast of Britishmutton (134 per  cent.), fish (134  per cent.),  legs of frozen mutton (126 per cent.),cheese  (123 per  cent.), thin  flank  of  British beef (121 per cent.), ribs of importedbeef (112 per cent.), flour (109 per cent.), and bread (100 per cent.).  The increase hasbeen least in the case of milk (60 per cent.), butter (67  per  cent.), margarine (68 percent.), tea (73 per cent.), and bacon (791 Per cent.).    The sharp rise  in  the prices  of  the  subsidiary foods shown in Table F, whichhad been so marked a feature of the earlier months of 1917, was checked in May,mainly as a result of the Food Controller^ Orders fixing maximum retail prices  foroat and maize products and for Deans, peas and pulse.   Of the nine articles includedin the Table, the prices of five (lentils,  oatmeal, Patna rice, Rangoon rice, and sago)were  about the same, in London, at the end of May as at the beginning, and the pricesof butter beans and haricot beans showed considerable reductions.  Split peas andtapioca were the only commodities for which the average prices were  higher  at  theend of the  month  than at  the beginning, and  the increases in these cases  werecomparatively small.   The arithmetical average  for all the  nine  articles  shows a decrease of 18 per cent, (on the basis of July, 1914, prices) compared  with a rise of 4* 3 per cent., on the average, for the principal commodities dealt with in Table E.     Notwithstanding  this reduction,  the  prices of these  subsidiary  foods are still exceptionally high in comparison with those prevailing before the war, the increases from July, 1914, to  1st June 1917, ranging  from about 100 per cent., in the case of rice, upwards to over  250 per  cent., in the case of haricot beans and lentils.
