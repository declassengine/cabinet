Letter from  Secretary,War Office to  Secretary,  War Cabinet.    II. Letter from  Sir W.  Graham Greene to Sir Maurice  Hankey.I.  Letter from Secretary,War Office to Secretary, War  Cabinet   &apos;            dated&apos; 29th. May, 1917.  Sir,         I am commanded by the Army Council  to  state  that  th-^y  are  informed by the Lords Commissioners  of  the Admiralty  that  the  Lords Commissi oners have communicated with  the War  Cabinet  with reference to the decision  of the Director General of  National Service respecting the release  for Military Service  of certain  officials in the Admiralty.         As  you are aware, under the decision of the  War Cabinet  of 5th February, 1917, all men fit.for General Service under  the age  of  23 on January 20th were to be released for  Military  Service, and all exemptions issued by Government Departments  to such men were to be cancelled.  If any question arose  between  the Army Council and another Department  under  that decision,  rerer^nce was to be made to the Director General of  National  Service for his decision.         In  connection with this decision, the  Lords  Commissioners  of the Admiralty informed the Army Council  in  a letter, of  the 15th February that the question of the  retention of certain  officials had already been discussed with the  Director General  of National Service, who proposed to hold a Conference of  representatives of hi3 own Department and of the War Office  and the Admiralty before coming to a final  decision  in the  matter.  The letter continues  &quot;I am accordingly to request that      pending such decision the Recruiting Officers concerned  may be informed that they should suspend action in regard to  the calling up  of these officials for Military Service.&quot;         On  the  20th February the Army Council  were informed  by the Director General of National &quot;service that he  had  received a  report from Mr. HOnoratus Lloyd, K.C. concerning  36 officials under 23 years of  age whom  the Admiralty  wished  to retain,  and  after carefully  considering  the report  had  come to  a decision.  Among other points  of  the decision was the  following:-          &quot;Of the.16 Included in  (4) Military Branch and (5)  War Registry one half  .&apos;8- may  be retained for  three  months.  The period  stated above will date from 21st instant.&quot;          On  the  23rd February a  letter was addressed  to the  Establishment Branch of the Admiralty from  the Directorate  of Recruiting asking for the registered  addresses of the  men  who were  to be  called up for service,and, no reply having  been received,  a reminder was  sent on the 23rd March.
6          On  the 16th April a letter was addressed &quot;by  the Lords &quot;   Commissioners to the Army Council statin- that with  regard  to    these  16 men the Director General of national Service was    informed by the Admiralty, C.E.1002 of the 27th February last    &quot;that  in view of the fact that they are engaged on vital    duties of the utmost consequence to the Navy, My Lords Com-    missioners  are unable to modify the orders which have been    given  for the retention of these men.&quot;  This reply from the    Admiralts&apos; was communicated to the Director General of    National Service, who informed the Army Council that unless    the Admiralty appealed to the War Cabinet and obtained from    them a different decision from that already given by the    Director General of National Service it v/as open to  the War    Office to call up the men for Military Service.7,          On  the 27th April the Army Council again requested    the Lords Commissioner?, to inform them of the names  of the    men whom they were prepared to release, and on the 5th May    the Council were informed that the Lords Commissioners were    not prepared to release any of the men in question.8.         On  the 17th May, the Army Council informed the Lords    Commissi oners that they were issuing instructions that the    16 men in question should be called to the Colours for    service on  23rd May, i.e. two dayr-3 after the date on which    the periods of exemption directed by the Director General    of National Service to be given to the 8 men had expired.9.          On the 21st May the Lords Commissioners informed the    Army Council that they had exercised the pov/ers conferred upon    them by Parliament in excepting these men from the operation    of the Military Service Act 1916  and that a copy of  the    correspondence was being sent to you.  Consequently  the    instructions to send the calling up notices have not been    i s sued. *                                              4!0*        An  unofficial letter from the Secretary to the Admiralty    (copy  enclosed) has now been received stating that in the    view of the First Lord the question should be raised with the    War Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War &quot;as the War    Office are  apparently the objecting party&quot; and stating that    the legal powers of the Admiralty to issue certificates of    exemption under the Military Service Act 1916 are not affected.    and that the decision of the Director General of National    Service cannot be substituted for that of the Admiralty.           The Army Council do not understand this attitude, as    they understand that the powers of any Government Department,    whether Statutory or otherwise, can only be exercised in    accordance  with the directions of the War Cabinet.   In this    case a direction has been given by the War Cabinet,  and the    Admiralty by their letter of 15th February 1917 (copy enclosed)    admitted the  jurisdiction of the Director General of ,   National Service.           The War Office arc therefore not in any sense the     objecting  party&quot; but the Army Council consider that the    question of enforcing the decision given under the directionsI   of the War  Cabinet can now only be decided by the War Cabinet.
        I am commanded by the Army Council to point out thatthev have endeavoured to carry out the decision of the WarCabinet that men fit for General Service under 23 should heobtained for the Army,  but that they have been hitherto unableto obtain these men owing to the action of the LordsCommissioners of the Admiralty,  and in this connection I amparticularly to draw attention to the following points     (a) The decision of the War Cabinet conferred on theDirector Gener:! of National Service the power to decide anycases of men whose retention was desired by any GovernmentDepartment.     (b) The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in pursuanceof that decision referred to the Director General certaincases for his decision.     (c) A decision was coiru unicated to the Lords Commissionersthat, as regards the 16  men in question,  one half should bereleased at  once,  and the other in three months from the21st February.     (d) The Lords Commissioners did not take any steps toappeal to the War Cabinet,  as it was open to them to do underthe directions  in force,  but refused to inform the ArmyCouncil which men were to be released at once.     (e) It  was not until the three months from the 21stFebruary had expired^ i .e . on the 21st&quot; Hay,  that&quot;&apos;the LordsCommissioners referred the matter tc the War Cabinet by for-warding a copy of the correspondence between the Departments.                                       I am etc.,                                      (Sgd)R.W.  BRADE.
T TCop:-of letter from Sir W. GrahaioJ^reej^ fto^S^1st June 1917.   d&quot; ar Eankevuajr  o x        Brad;e  has  gGnt me a ccp7 of the correspondencerelatiuc- to the release  for military cervicc of certainofficials in the war  Staff of the Admiralty cent to you witha view presumably that this^ additional correspondence shouldhe circulated to the  v/ar  Oabine/c      You will notice that the correspondence does not includethe semi-official correspondence which passed &quot;between the First    Lord and Lord Derby and Mr.Chamberlain.  It is desirable,therefore that it should  bo made clear that the Admiralty hadreason for thinking  that  the reasonableness of their contentionwas accepted ana that no  further action was necessary on their      As the Admiralty understood the position, the Director ofnational Service was set up to be an arbiter in cases In which theWar Office and another Department night not agree, and. in thecase in question the First Lord regarded hie private corres-pondence with Lord Derby, including the latterfs letter of  7thFebruary and the First Lord:s reply of the  8th February, asindicating that Lord Darby was willing in regard to these 16men (who *?ere only a portion of the men previously consideredby Mr.Chamberlain) to accept the First Lord&apos;s personal assur-ance that they could not be eparedo      This supposed agreement having been reached,- the DirectorGeneral of National Service did not come into the matter and thequestion of an appeal to the War Cabinet did not arise.   It wasnot until the &quot;7ar Off ice letter of the 27th April was receivedthat there was any clear Indication that the War Office had notwithdrawn-their claim, and in reply to that letter the Admiraltyat once called attention to the correspondence between the FirstLord and Lord Derby.   On re-eiving the further War Office letter -of the 16th May pressing their claim, the Admiralty then tool:steps to lay the case before the Far Cabinet.     I think this briefly explains what could be gathered from aperucal cf the correspondnce of which I have already sent you acopy.     To cum up, the cese of the Admiralty rests on two arguments:        (1)   That the Len in cueeticn are in Quite a unique             position and indispensable in the seme that no             other civilian employees are.(2)j.hat tne Admiralty rave certain statutory rightswnich the national Service Department and theWar Office have apparently ignored.            Believe me,-  &amp;c                 (Sgd)   VI. GRAHAM GREECE
