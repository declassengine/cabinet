SECRET.G.T. 950.             WAR CABINET.           RESTRICTION OF SKIPPING TO TEE ATLANTIC.  -  (Copy ofbetter from Sir E.Carson to Sir M.Hankey.)                                              5th June 1917.My dear Hankey,     I have been looking into the Minutes of War Cabinet No. 150Item 24, Restriction of Shipping to Atlantic, and I am not quitesure that the wording, when interpreted by those y/ho&quot; were not at themeeting exactly conveys what was either decided or approved.     The Minute sets out that until the machinery for purchasingetc was in working order, the Dominions, India, and the Allies,were not to be informed, and also that each purchasing Departmentshould at once take the necessary preliminary steps to procureits further supplies as far as possible from the United Statesand Canada, and limit its commitments in other markets to thelowest possible level.   This clearly can be read as authorityfor taking executive action, i.e. to set up maci inery and to takepreliminary steps in the direction indicated.  This cannot possiblybe done without it immediately becoming known to the Dominions,India, and the Allies, who are not to be toldl     The instructions that purchasing Departments are to lir.ittheir commitments in other markets to the lowest possible level,might very legitimately be taken  as authorising them to cancellong-running contracts if they could dc so upon reasonablyfavourably terms -  and that would, of course immediately givethe policy away.     The preliminary steps to limit commitments in other partsofjthe world would be taken as  an  instruction not to continuecontracts or place new contracts, and to divert our&apos; purchasing to America.   This would have the immediate effect of running themarket up against us, and would put America into the positionof a favoured middleman.   It would also have a very distfc bingeffect upon the financial situation both in America and otherparts of the world.214    What I really think the War Cabinet intended was that theDepartments should review their probable purchases for, s&quot;ey, thenext 13 months,  and should see to what extent it would be possibleto divert them to Amerioa without having to pay excessively, andthat they should report thereon but not take any executive actionat the moment.   W-Swn their reports were received the matter couldbe further considered by the War Cabinet, and by the Shipping Con-troller and others concerned, including the new organisation whichis being set up in America, and then we should be in a position tosee what could be done, and could consult as necessary with theDominions, India, and the Allies.     I suggest that as this Minute must necessarily have had a fail;-ly wide distribution, and, if interpreted as I think it can beinterpreted, will get into many hands,  it would be wise to issue anamendment of it or an explanatory memorandum upon it..                       Yours sincerely,(Sgd)    EDWARD CARSON.
