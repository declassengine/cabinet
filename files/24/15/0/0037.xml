WAR CABINET.

A Conference was held at the War Office on the 31st May, 1917, to consider and report upon the question of the defence of United Kingdom against attack by Aircraft, with special reference to:-

1. Measures necessary to secure effective co-operation between Naval and Military forces.

2. Organisation of Communications.

3. Distribution of information.

4. Allotment of the Air Forces.

There were present:-

1. Lieut. General Sir David Henderson said that the policy which had been laid down by the War Committee in February 1915, i.e. that the Navy were to deal with enemy aircraft attempting to reach this country, while the Army undertaken to deal with all such aircraft which reach these shores, had been adhered to, although to a certain extent modified by arrangements between the two services.

At the present time, the Navy give information of impending raids, and intercept the raiders on their return journey.

2. The Conference considered that with about four hours fuel capacity, the range of German aeroplanes must be taken to have a radius of about 125 miles, and that the area liable to attack by enemy aeroplanes in considerable numbers is that bounded by Bury St. Edmunds and Brentford to Rottingdean.

North of Southwold it is considered that the long sea journey makes attack unlikely.


     (l)  By seaplanes,  which have wireless,  and communicate          with West gate and Felixstowe.,  thence direct to the          Admiralty air exchange,.     (2)  By light-ships.     It was suggested that trained observers  ohould heemployed in the light-ships and Lajor-General Sir F*C, Shawsaid he v/ould take up this question with the  Admiralty.     The Admiralty undertook to instruct the  Royal Naval AirService at Dunkirk to keep a careful v/atch on the enemy&apos;saerodromes at Ghistelle and St. Denis West for any unusualmovement of enemy aircraft, and agreed to consider whetherextended patrols seaward were possible with a view to gainingfurther information.     The placing of a look-out ship in a position aboutlatitude 510 - 321 IT,, and longitude l0 - 47&apos;  E. is underconsideration by the Admiralty..4.   In the raid of 25th May, it took thirteen minutes forthe information from the Tongue light-ship to be receivedby Home Forces.   This information had to go  through fourtransmitting stations-.     Home Forces and the Admiralty were requested toascertain where the delay occurred and what were the bestmeans to be adopted to ensure more rapid communication Inthe future.   It was suggested that direct communicationshould be arranged between Foreness and the Admiralty.-5,   Communication between Kcme Forces,  the OfficerCommanding Home Defence Group, and Squadrons  is satisfactory.,but it appeared that the distribution of information aboutthe raiders after they had crossed the coast  line wasdefective, and Home Forces were requested to  examine thisquestion with a view to an improvement  in this respect..     It was suggested that the Naval authorities shouldadopt the same ground signals as those at present in use bythe Army., and the Admiralty representativesundertook to gointo this, point.     The question of using v/ireless to  communicate withmachines in the air should form the subject of a separatediscussion.6.   The Navy have the following patrols:-          From Sheerness to Maplin Sands.           &quot;   Westgate td Barrow Lightship.           &quot;   Felixstowe to Barrow Lightship.           &quot;   North Foreland to ?/almer,also          .Felixetcwe to North Hinder.           &quot;   Lowest oft to Terschelling..     These patrols are run by  seaplanes which are of nofighting value,.     It was agreed that it would be both wasteful anduneconomical to Bend out machines over  the sea to attempt  tointercept enemy machines,.  The only fighting  machines whichthe Navy can use without detriment to their overseas  require-ments are at Manstone. Walmer and Dover,  where a varyingnumber are always available,  usually about six at each place.3.   Information as to  an intended  raid  is  conveyed.:-
7.   Colonel Higgins explained the most recent dispositionsof the Royal Flying Corps and the system of patrollingover the land.    He said that the arrangements for dealingwith Zeppelins  had not &quot;been interfered with.     At the time of the recent raid the only aircraftavailable to meet attack by day were those at the dis-pcsal of Home Forces;    there ^ere in all 22 aeroplanesavailable in the area attacked..     The following arrangements are in progress to rein-force tho aircraft in the area described in paragraph 2     (a)  Training Brigade Squadrons are being moved into this          area.     (b)  Orfordness and Martlesham Heath Experimental          Stations are being organised for the protection          of Essex north of the river Blackwater.,     A map is attached showing the system cf patrolling;the machines available whon the above changes are com-pleted will be  as Under :-     40 machines for the patrol round London.,     17 machines  &quot;   &quot;     &quot;   from Goldhanger to Detling..      8 machines  &quot;   &quot;     &quot;   from Chiddingstone to Harden                                and Hastings to Romney.      6 machines  &quot;   &quot;     &quot;   from Dover to Broadsalts.     In addition there are 10 machines between Throwley andBekesbourne.   This will mean a total reinforcement ofabout 59 machines of a better type, but as these machinesare used primarily for training purposes, only about $0%of them can be  relied upon at any moment.   The totalnumber therefore to be relied upon will be $1 asagainst 22 atihe time cf the raid.     The Conference considered that the patrol across the riverThames east of  Woolwich from Goldhanger to Detling was weakand should be strengthened by better fighting machines..  TheGeneral Officer Commanding, Royal Flying Corps undertook toarrange this.8*   The Conference were of opinion that it is not at presentpossible to increase further the aircraft available to meetattack by day at Home without detriment to the requirements cfOverseas theatres.9-   It was considered that no measures which could be takenwould prevent bombs being dropped on towns,  but that under thearrangements proposed there was no likelihood that the enemyaeroplanes would be able to avoid an engagement with our ownfighting machines.     The Conference submit tho following recommendations1.   The role of the Navy should be confined to giving informationof impending raids antf intercepting the raiders on their returnjourney.
2.   Communication between the Lightships  and  G..H.Q,. Home  Forcesshould be speeded up.3.   Trained Observers should be employed  on Lightships.4.   The R.JJ.A.S. at Dunkirk should be  instructed  to keep  a-careful watch for any unusual movement  of  enemy  aircraft-at their aerodromes in Belgium.&apos;5-   Information about the raiders after they  cross the  coastshould be distributed with greater speed and accuracy.6. .... The Navy should adopt the same ground signals as  thosein use by the Army..-7.   The use of wireless for communication with  machinesin the aiir should form the. subject of a separate discussion.8.   The patrol east of Woolwich should be strengthened bys^fflG quick climbing machines.(sgd.(sgd,(sgd.(sgd,(sgd.(sgd.DAVID HENDERSON,           Lt. Gen.G.W. PAINE,           Commodore.GEORGE P.W.
