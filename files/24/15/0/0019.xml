6Ve-64From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st June 191 7.      (Received at India Office, 11.45 p.m.)   Secret.  Following from Political Agent, Wana, 29th May :-   &quot; I have received following report from  an LTrma of  Kanigorum, that aJirga of Mahsuds  under Fazl Diu was  held  at Kanigorum on 27th  May.Khost  delegates  were present.   Fazl  Din informed  Jirga that lie  hadreceived a letter from Kabul in which Amir  forbade any Mahsuds to come toKabul for allowances as  long as the tribe was  at war with Government andalso forbade them to light unless our troops entered their couniry.  Mahsudsafter consultation replied that they were willing to resume friendly relationswith Government and return stolen  rifles  if their prisoners were releasedand their allowances restored, but otherwise they will be compelled to fight.Letter  on above lines are  being  despatch(ed) to Kabul and the  PoliticalAgent at YVano.&quot;   Amir&apos;s  action if correctly reported  puts new complexion  on  wholesituation, and gives promise of real co-operation on frontier, while Mahsudsmust be greatly disheartened by his attitude  and alarmed at our concentrationof troops.  In- these circumstances we were considering whether it wouldnot still be possible to call in Mahsud Jirga to Jandola and effect settlementwith Mahsuds which might tide us over till end of  war, and at the same time.avoid risk of estranging  and embarrassing  Amir  by advance into Mahsudcountry contrary to his advice.  Terms of settlement which we contemplatedwere restoration of allowances without arrears at  the  end of 10 months,provided that  Mahsuds  behaved  well for  that period and restored  lostGovernment rifles in their  possession.   On  our side we would release suchharmless Mahsud prisoners as are in our hands.  We have telegraphed toRoos Keppel in this sense, but unfortunately report has  since been receivedthat gang of Mahsuds surprised Tut  Narai post in Tochi  on the 31st May,killing live militia  and capturing quantity of  rifles and  ammunition.   Thisincident may possibly put idea of peaceful settlement out of the question, andshould justify us in Amirs eyes in  any punitive action we may be forced totake, though such action might none  the  less  embarrass  him.   We willreport  when we have views of Roos Keppel and Donald ; meantime we arecontinuing preparations  for advance via Jandola.
