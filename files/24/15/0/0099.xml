From Lieutenant-Colonel BlairTo D.M.I.                                      Petrograd                                         8th June 19171153          The workmen here have definitely declared that astrike will not take place in view of further concessionsby the employers.   The threatened strike has also been tem-porarily postponed in the Donetz coal basin, as the demandsof the workmen have been handed over to a commission whichis to commence investigating these demands not later thanJune 18th.   It will mean complete dislocation of railwaysand stoppage of work in all factories if there is a strikein the Donetz basin.          The situation as regards labour is for the presentbetter but the crisis is almost certain to recur in view ofthe likelihood of many of the factories having to close downin a few weeks.           I saw M. Rodzianko this morning,   He was very pessimistic and said that the situation both here and at thefront was bad as he did not believe the offensive even if itcame off would be successful.   Gn the other hand, I met aftewards one of the Black Sea delegates who has just returnedfrom the South-West front.   He was full of optimism and saidthat the offensive could be carried out as soon as reserveshad been collected in rear in a week or   and that would becarried out under conditions of supply forage and munitionswhich were better than they ever before ( ? group omitted )He said special striking detachments had been formed in allunits composed of officers and men who had undertaken tolead any offensive.   He was undoubtedly an extreme optimist.He had fist been to Kronstadt where he said all the troublewas now over and was caused by a small circle of extremists.Lenin had visited and had been kicked out by the workmen fromthe Obukhov works.
