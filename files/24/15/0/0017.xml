57Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.SECTION.B.WEEKLY REPORT ON AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. III.June 2, 1917.     The  situation  in Hungary has  developed more slowly thanwas at first  expected.   Count Andrassy has been selected asCount Tisza&apos;s successor,  but  the  composition of the new Cabinetis still  not  announced.   Some faint  indication of its probablecharacter may be  gathered from  the names of those whom theEmperor-King  has  recently received in audience since the crisis.These include Counts Apponyi  and  Karolyi, heads of the twoIndependence  groups: Count Zichy  and M. Rakovszky, the twoleaders of the Clerical  People&apos;s  Party:  Dr Wekerle, the ex-Premier of the Coalition Cabinet  (1906-9):  Count Khuen-Hedervaryand Dr Lukacs, Count Tisza&apos;s  two  predecessors as Premier andleader of the Party of National fJork:  MM.,Navay and Berzeviczy,former Presidents of the Chamber:  and several clerical andConservative  magnates.   Prom  none  of these politicians, if theyshould enter  the  new Cabinet, could  anything even remotelyapproaching a change of  system  be  expected.   Most of themwould be  prepared to go  a few stages further in the matter offranchise reform  than the uncompromising Tisza himself:  but allstand committed to  the strict maintenance of the Magyarhegemony, and all save Karolyi  may be regarded as open Germanophils.Andrassy, Apponyi,  Berzeviczy,  Vekerle and the two Zichys areall active sympathisers  with  and  contributors to &quot;Das jungeEuropa&quot;,  the  monthly Hungarian  review published in Berlin inGerman for the express purpose  of  promoting the closestrelations between Hungary and Germany,  it is worth adding thatthe Democratic and  Socialist  parties, which are mentioned in
                                               i      1                           -2-                       ritishsome telegrams in the Berlin Press as likely to share in thecontrol of the new Government, are absolutely negligible factorsin Hungary under the existing franchise.  The &quot;Democrats&quot;consist of two  daputies * the one, M. Vazsonyi, influentialin the Budapest Town Council, but nowhere else - while theSocialists are unrepresented in Parliament and have no leaderswho carry any weight.     The long delay in the formation of the Cabinet may possiblybe due to  the  fact  that  the Party  of national V/ork,  which has amajority in Parliament,  shows no signs of breaking up or ofdeserting  Count  Tisza.    Tisza*s speech to a meeting of his partyafter his  resignation took the form of a very outspoken warningto the Crown,  to the effect that the very trifling franchiseextension  v/hich  h-.  was pr-^par-d to concede (amounting,  it iscalculated, to only 30,000 new electors) was the maximum con-sistent with the safety  of the Magyar political  supremacy.    Hedrew a specially pointed distinction between the King of Hungaryand the Emperor  Charles  and threatened ^Bclentless opposition&quot;to the Crown,  if it should try to  carry  through  more extensivereforms.   These outspoken phrases make  it clear that theimperor-King definitely  favours a  genuine franchise reform inHungary, and on  the other hand that he is faced  by the  sameopposition from  the ruling caste v/hich blocked the movement forreform from 1905 onwards.     The meeting of the  Austrian Reichsrat has given rise incertain sections of the  Entente Press to comment  almost  asextravagant as did  the fall of Tisza:  but no evidence v/hateveris as yet  available that it foreshadows  a change  of system.    Thatthe new ^mperor  is  genuinely  desirous of restoring normal con-stttutionaO. government may be accepted as certain.    The profounddiscontent aroused  by the fact thai Auntria. was  the  only
belligerent  whose parliament wan  not  allowed to meet foundexpression in  the murder  of  Count Stflrgkh  by Friedrich Adlcr.Since then war-weatfirieoo  has grown,  and ouch groso contractscandals as  the Kr:uitz  trial have rendered the lack of a politicalsafety-valve more apparent.    But the decisive factor in thesummons of Parliament has undoubtedly been the Russian ^evolution.It is only necessary to point  to  the tremendous effect to theearlier and  successful  Revolution of 1905 in launching the move-ment for Universal  Suffrage  in Austria and in Hungry, in orderto indicate  the certain effect of the far greater upheaval of1917.   But  quite  apart from this the Emperor and his adviserscannot fail  to see  that their  overtures to Russia could have noserious chance of  success so long as the Russian democracy sawitself confronted by an autocratic and unparliamentary Austria.     A v/eek  before  the  opening of the Reichsrat the vacancies inthe Upper House v/ere filled  by the creation of five hereditaryand fifty-five life peers.  The  list is-in itself a sufficientproof that no  change of policy in intended.   It includes eightprominent generals  (Conrad yon HOtzendorf, Dankl, etc.) CountMensdorff, the late Ambassador in London, Dr. Dumba, of V/ashington fame, six German industrial  magnates (including Rothschild andSkoda), a few  distinguished  savants and various German ex-Ministers such as the Christian Socialiot leaders Gessmann and V/ei%skirchner.But from the whole list one  name  stands out - Herr Moritz Benedikt,the proprietor of  the Heue Freie  Presse and the first AustrianJournalist to  receive a peerage.    It is impossible to exaggeratethe evil influence of Eerr Benedikt and his powerful and brilliantly edited newspaper in envenoming racial feuds in Austria, inbolstering up  the  Dual  System  and Magyar i sat ion, and in thwarting 4. 1 me various pre-war attempts to reconcile Germans and Czechs.   He
has always stood for crass  materialism in politics an:! on thebourne,  and has consistently  furthered the interests of Berlin.Eis newspaper was right  in  summing up  the whole lint as &quot;govern-mental in its real tendencies&quot;.     The attitude of the German  parties to the election of thePresident of the Chamber shows how slight are the ^opoeaiB ofconcession to the Slays.    Their candidate,  Dr. Gross, thePresident of the German  national Union, is a militant Germanfrom Moravia who has lone, led the struggle against the Czechs;and his  selection * as a  deliberate defiance.    It may be notedthat among the party leaders  who visited the jimperor at Ia*x-emburglast week was Herr K.K.  Wolf, the Pan-German leader, who 15years ago led the chorus of deputies who sang &quot;Hoch und Heil denKohenzollern&quot; and insulted  the Habsburg dynasty on the floor ofthe house.   The fact that  his party supports the present regimeis in itself a proof that the Government is not Slav in sympathiesDr. Gross received 215 votes; details  are not yet available, butit is clear that the Czechs,  Jugo-Slavs and Ukrainians filled inblank forms, while most  of  the Poles seem to have absented them-selves.    The Germans were  thus  left alone in possession of thefield.     The Germans - clericals  as  well as Nationals - fu ;her under-lined their standpoint by selecting another Pan-German, HerrPacher,  as their spokesman  in the opening debate.     The speech from the Throne  is capable of double interpre i-tion throughout.   It contains professions of devotion to con-stitutionalism (dormant  since karch 1914), but lays special stresson the fact that any &quot;decisions  to be  taken at the great momentof the conclusion of peace&quot; rest with  the Crown alone.   TheGalician question is specially exempted from the problems to besolved:  the phrases used indicate that Galicia!s connection with
I61Austria will &quot;be looser than hitherto,  hut do not define theextent to which the separation will he carried.     The striking feature is the announcement of the postponmentof the constitutional oath until &quot;the  foundations of a new,strong and happy Austria&quot; can he laid.    This cuts both ways.The reason why the Pan-Germans demanded the exclusion of Galicia&quot;by Octroi before Parliament met, was because such a change inthe constitution could not be legally  effected save by Parliament,and because therefore the demise of the Crown v/ould enable thenew Lmperor to introduce the change before taking the oath.   The                                                 fct/THj able v. i  gpostponment thus leaves him still in the position of^exclud^t?Galicia without Parliamentary consent  yet without breaking theletter of the law.    But it also leaves him equally free torestore the Bohemian constitution,  if  he should  so decide,  andthe Speech vaguely alludes to the need of &quot;expanding the Con-stitution and the administrative foundations of  public life,especially in Bohemia&quot;.     The Germans have lost no time inannouncing that they will fiercely  resist any attempt to concedeCzech claims.   This stiff attitude io&apos; of course to b-  explain; dby the fact that the restoration of Bohemia involves the abolitionof the Dual System and hence of the privileged position of theGermano and Magyars.     Meanwhile the attitude of the  Czech parties in without allprecedent.   In their name M. Stanek  (who as a  clerical representstheir moot moderate wing)  demanded  the  reshaping of the Monarchyinto&quot;a federal State of free national  States with equal rights&quot;,^d as a logical sequence of this,the union of the Czechs  andSlovaks in a single unit.    This is an  open declaration of war onthe &quot;Magyar State idea&quot;.    The Munchener Heueste  ffachrichten pointsout that the text of these declarations bore a striking similarityto phrases used b^  President \7ilson, and it is safe  to regard  this
as a veiled response of the Czech parties  to  the  reference  totheir &quot;liberation&quot;  contained in  the  Allied :jote of January  10.Their action follows upon  (1)  a  remarkable Kanifesto  of  theCzech journalists protesting against the Censors&apos;  practice  ofcompelling the insertion of official articles and commentwithout  allowing the source to be mentioned:(2) a manifestoof 130/Czech men of letters  re-asserting Bohemia&apos;s nationalrights and (3)   a communique issued by  the  Czech Club  onMay 20 announcing&quot;new claims&quot; and  an  extended political pro-gramme as  a result  of the  events of the war.leading1 .W.S.T.
