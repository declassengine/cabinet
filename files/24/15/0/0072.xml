                    INTELLIGENCE  BUREAU.SOME  REFLECTIONS  ON  GERMANY          at the   STOCKHOLM   CONFERENCE.          The. scheme of an International Socialist Conferenceat Stockholm, championed as it is &quot;by the St.Petersburg Sol-diars&apos;  and &quot;Workmen&apos;s Union, doubtless presents some awkwardproblems to the Allies, more especially, as the Debate in theChamber shows, to Prance.   But it ought not to be forgottenthat the scheme likewise involves Germany in perplexities,difficulties and dangers.   The new Bloc of the CatholicCentre, National Liberals, amalgamated Radicals and MajoritySocialists in the Reichstag may be willing to support Herr vonBethmann-Kollwog in giving Soheidemands mission to Stockholma chanoe;  but the outcry, not merely among the Prussian Con-servatives, but also among large sections of the bourgeoisie,who are under Pan-German, Chauvinistic or anti-semitic in-fluenoeB, will be loud and.persistent;  and, in the army, even,.the new types of officers of the Reserve will hardly be ableto reconcile themselves to the idea of the socialist Leader&apos;sappearance in what is really a kind of semi-official diplomaticmission,   A running fire of commentary will be kept up in thepress and on the platform, and many speeches will be deliveredlike that of Herr von Eeydebrand on May 21st at Herford, wherehe indulged in the most violent abuse of lierr Scheidemann andof any compromise with the Social Democracy.   Certainly, ifbijheidemann fails at Stockholm, whatever may be the reason, theChancellor will have to endure violent attacks in Pcrliament
and outside for having compromised the German cause by lendingtbe slightest countenance to the International oocialist Congress.Already some of the German papers are praising M. Ribofs speechin the French Chamber and are asking:  when shall we hear fromour own leading statesmen such frank n.7ords in repudiation ofInternationalism?German Methods and Equipment for Stockholm.          Knowing the German methods well from experience, and,in particular, having watched them closely at the last HagueConference (1907),  I think it very probable that Scheidemannand the Majority Socialist Delegates will be thoroughly equippedwith secretarial staff, interpreters and dossiers in support ofa German (Socialist) peace scheme.   The German legation atStockholm will, doubtless, be instructed to make all the neces-sary preparations secretly or overtly, and they will probablybe very efficiently made.   Soheidemann will be able, like theapostles at Pentecost, to address the members of the Conferencein any language, because he will be provided with interpreterscapable of translating his speeches sentence by sentence, withproper rhetorical emphasis and effect.   I have repeatedly heardthe late General Booth&apos;s speeches translated in this way, sen-tence by sentence,  with great effect to foreign audiences, andthe German Socialists are accustomed to such arrangements attheir own International Congresses.          If the Delegates of other nationalities have not madeBimilar arrangements, they will be at a great disadvantage.In particular, Scheidemann and his Germen colleagues will beable to address effectively worded appeals to the Russians inRussian.          Their dossiers, arguments and &quot;evidence&quot; will all bebeautifully arranged beforehand with a view to all emergencieswhich they can foresee, and will be very handy and serviceable.
The equipment of the German Delegation at the Hague Peace Con-ferences was in this respect the wonder end the despair of someof the other Delegations          The Germans will probably be attended by a band of       ^journalists and other agents,whose business it will be to talkto the Russian Delegates and journalists outside the Conferenceitself.Publicity:          Whether the proceedings of the Conference be open orsecret, the Germans will carefully arrange a publicity campaignin neutral countries.   The fact that they may be cut off bythe oensorship from the press  of the Allies will not seriouslymatter.   They will insidiously try to inspire the Russianpress;  they will make themselves the chief source of newsabout the Conference, as Baron von Harschall did at the Haguein 1907.   liven Allied Journalists, especially Americans, willbe tempted to refer to them-   They must even now have manyagents in Russia, to whom information and instructions can beconveyed.   I do not see how,  in the present semi-anarchicstate of Russia, such agents can be under any effective sur-veillanoe by the Russian police - if there now is any Russianpolice.          In this connection it would be interesting to knowwhat is happening to the numerous German prisoners in Russia.There must be many intelligent Russian-speaking officers amongthem,who probably do not find much difficulty in escaping andwho might become most effective agents of the German peacepropaganda.The Minority Socialist Delegates:          If these actually attend the Conference, they willfind it difficult to denounce their own country and its policy
  &apos;                                                             27S                          -4-in the presence of the Majority Socialists.    fi&apos;hey probablywill not he so well equipped for conveying in foreign, languageswhat they want to say.   The German legation at Stockholm willsee to it that they are treated in a step-motherly way, especial-ly if they give an excuse for such treatment by denouncingScheidemann and the German Government.    Under present conditionsthey may claim furtherance from their legation es German citizens,but there are  different degrees of furtherance which a legationcan aocord.          Branting (the Swedish President of the Conference)could doubtless counteract German schemes for dominating theproceedings,  if he appointed a common staff  of interpreters,secretaries,  etc.  and permitted this staff alone to act.  Buthe probably has not thought of these things, while the Germanswill certainly have thought them all out          Bethraann-Hollweg, Zimmermann and their ImperialMaster,  having no  scruples or &quot;sympathies&quot; or exoessive amourpropre where  they are seeking an advantage,  will temper theirpolicy and their personal, as well as their  press, utterances,in accordance  with the nature of the reports v/hich they willdaily receive  from otockholm.    Unless  decisive successes areachieved there,  there will probably be  a marked reserve on thepart of the German Government,  owin.3 to the  danger which Ihave already mentioned of their being disastrously affected bythe results of the Conference,  if they amounted to failure.But whether they &quot;boom&quot; the Conference  in their press or onlykeep up a trickle  of news and leading articles and entre-filetsabout it, they will certainly do their best  to give it a chanceof success from the point of view of jes.ce.    If the Allied,  or,for example,  the l^ench, press, ignores the  Conference, theGermans can reproach the Allies with this attitude, just asthey would have reproached them for refusing to allow Delegates
                           -Drfrom the Allied countries  to  attend.    Although the Alliedpress were to take little  or  no notice  of the Conference,  theRussian and German press would  contain  a good deal shout it andthere would thus arise a kind of tete-a-tete between theRussian and German press,  even  if the presence of Delegates fromthe Allied countries prevented  the Conference itself from beoom-ing a tete-a-tete between  the Russian and Germcn Socialists.On the other hand, if the  press of sll  countries discusses theConference from day to day, it  will be  making splendid propa-ganda for the German peace schemes.             I have already mentioned considerations which mustbe a source of anxiety to  the German authorities, but in someways they have, as regards the  projected Conference, a good handof cards at the start.                                      G . Vi .                                  7th June,  1217.P.S.   The workmen end Soldiers&apos; Union at Petrograd oftenreminds me, mutatis mutandis  (a large order!) of the Committeeof Union and Progress which engineered  the revolution in Turkey,and afterwards for years directed, or iecisively influenced,the new regime there.    Just as Baron Hersch&amp;ll von Bieberstein(then German ambassador at Constantinople) speedily managed toget into touch with the Committee and to re-establish, and evenincrease, German influence, so  the Germans mav hope, throughtheir numerous avowed and unavowed agents, to make use of soanarchic a body as the Workmen and Soldiers1 Union.             The Germans,  having neither scruples nor &quot;sympathies&quot;can work  (l) for the dissolution of Russia (2) for a pacifistRussian regime,  (3) for Russian reaction, as it suits them;  orthey can work with sll tbree objects in view, ultimately back-                                                          ing
ing whichever  catches  on-   The honesty and  the sympathies ofthe Allies  may put  them (the Allies) at a temporary disadvan-ta&amp;e.
