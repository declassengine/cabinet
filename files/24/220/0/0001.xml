(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majosty&apos;s Government -)[SECRET. ;P.51  (31)C  A 3 I N E TOIL      FUEL      EE S E R V E.NOTE BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY-The enclosed, memorandum by the First Sea Lord is circulated to the Cabinet with the object of placing on record the view of the Sea Lords on the omission from the Navy. Estimates of any provision for adding to the Oil Fuel Reserve.AAdmiralty. 17.2.31.
GRET IThe Sea Lords wish to record their grave anxiety at the decision of the Government that no yearly addition to the Naval oil fuel reserve is at present contemplated.2. They feel that the situation inregard to oil is one of serious concern in the event of National emergency, particularly in view cf the increasing use af oil in British Morchant Ships, for which no oil reserve has been provided as reccmmended by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1924.    (Vide. Minutes of lSlst Meeting).3. They consider the recommendationsof the Oil Board (C-I.D.1007-B dated July 1930), based en most careful Investigations, emphasise their strong protest.4. A memorandum on the oil situation as it affects the Fleet is attached.(Initialled) F.L.F.12th February 1931.
An addition to the oil fuel reserve of the Fleet this year Is considered of such importance that the situation is again reviewed to emphasise the absolute necessity of It to the efficiency of the Navy in any emergency, of whatever kind it may be.2. The capital, outlay on our present Fleet (whichis still the main form of National Insurance) has been more than 200 million pounds-      This Fleet unfortunately depends for Its propulsion on oil, which Is a foreign product and is limited in supply by many factors.      The supply gives us no difficulty In peace but to cover the emergency of war an adequate reserve is essential in order that the Fleet may bo capable of Its functions .3. The basis upon which the Admiralty calculate thisreserve is a year&apos;s steaming under war conditions, viz.sseven million tens - of this four million have been collected and suitably disposed.      It is of interest to notice what the other Powers have done in this respect. InAmerica, the problem is simple.      The Navy has its cwn oilfields;    even so,  It is laying down a reserve besides,equal to the amount we ask for.      Japan, notwithstandinglocal resources and the fact that their requirements coverwork in but one Ocean,  are laying down a basis of two years&apos;war consumption.    Germany has already acquired 11 months&apos;war consumption in reserve,  and this is considered by themInsufficient.    France, nine months - Italy alone standsrelatively at   about our present reserve.This Empire has its trade to protect in all the seven seas;    a trade upon which it is entirely deoendentfor.....
for feeding this country. How much more then, do we require &quot;adequate reserves of a foreign fuel than nations who have so much less to protect and also have that fuel to a greater or lesser extent on the premises*4, Fuel oil is not a wasting asset.    It has always a market value, which is not the case with other  stores re-quired in war,  such as shells,  cordite,  torpedoes,  etc. The value may in fact increase, for the process known as &quot;cracking&quot;  is being applied much more freely in order to extract from the oil the lighter products of greater commercial value.    In this way, it is certain that in the none too distant future,  a shortage of fuel oil will ?ccur. 5. Before the  war,  ships mainly burned coal of whiohimmense reserves lay under the ground of this country. Maintenance of reserve was not then necessary, but with a fuel of which less than 2% of the world&apos;s present supply lies within our Empire, with supplies swallowed up by India, and with Anglo Persian fields in a foreign territory a short  distance from the Russian border,  our position is,  to say the least,  far from reassuring unless we collect a largo-reserve to rely upon.6. 40% of our mercantile marine are now oil burning.In war, British ships and such neutrals as may be persuaded to work on our side, will find groat  difficulties in procuring oil fuel and may well lay claim to a share of the oil fuel reserve.    When the original Fleet estimate of 7 millions was put forward, this oil burning merchant fleet was much smaller and the point was not considered in any sense In regard to tho Fleet!s reserve.    Proposals were in fact put forward about 1923 for a commercial reserve of one million tons but no  action was taken.7* That the  greatest possible advantage to the nationwould accrue if a method could be found of obtaining theFleet&apos; s.....o
Fleet1 s oil supply from coal is obvious, but a close Investigation of this subject makes it far from hopeful. Neither high nor low temperature carbonisation show the slightest  prospects of producing oil suitable for the Navy to any degree worthy of serious consideration - with an extract of only 10 to 18 gals,  of crude oil for every ton of coal, these two processes could do little or nothing tc help the Fleet&apos;s requirements.    &quot;Hydrogenation&quot;,  as it Is called, may however have an economic future in the petrol market.      To develop it to the extent reqtiired to supply the nation&apos;s patrol would,  it is estimated,, require a capital outlay of not loss than 60 millions on the basis of a 3 million annual consumption cf petrol.S. Assuming, however, that this plant for petrolproduction could in emergency produce a suitable fuel oil for the Fleet,  then the amount forthcoming would be determined by the extent to which the&apos;nation&apos;s petrol consumption could be reduced.    This amount could not at its very best exceed one million tons, whereas the National requirement of oil fuel (i.e. for Naval and Oivil use in this country and for Dominions and Colonies - vide Oil Board report) will be in the neighbourhood of 14 million tons on the present basis of consumption.      The whole question of &quot;oil.from coal&quot; was very fully treated by the oil Board in their 5th Annual Report  (G.I.D.  Paper 100VB)  -approved by C.I.D.   at its 2 50th meeting.9* There Is, however,  another point in this matter,which it is essential to appreciate.    It is this - given the immense plant and Its large production of petrol, it will take time before oil fuel can be made   available,  and during that time the Fleet&apos;s consumption will continue to exhaust the reserves we have collected.    It is against this as well as so many other contingencies that a large fuel reserve is so essential.    Thus, whatever the effect of extracted oil
in this country in the coming years, the Fleet cannot obtain appreciable benefit.10* Under the most favourable conditions,  it will now take six years at the anticipated annual additions, to complete the Fleet oil reserves to 7 million tens.    It would take 30 years at the smaller addition to which the Admiralty had proposed to reduce their figure in this year of extreme financial stress.      There Is a British firm unable to  sell Its creosote  (American demand having failed) There is Roumania with whom the Government is so anxious to-trade.      Present oil contracts do not ai5ir.it of tenders this year and only additions to reserve can help these two oourceg of supply.      At the moment wo have sufficient free tankage to store up to \ million tons.11. Fuel was a large factor in england greatness.Originally, the handling of the wind as a prcnellant pave us an  advantage through our aptitude  as seamen.      Then the invention of the engine introduced our local coal as the sea-fuel of the world.    Possibly, sometime in the future, coal (in the form of gas) may  again challenge oil, but for the present we   are restricted to the use of  a foreign-raised fuel,   and therefore have to maintain an adequate reserve of it so that the Fleet, uponwhich we still  depend, may function in every emergency which can still demand its services -
