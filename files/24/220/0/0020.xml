This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government.Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1931.2c3SECRET.Copy No.     ijCP. 70 (31).THE CABINET.THE ARMY AND AIR FORGE (ANNUAL,) BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. I circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill. n()2. There are only two points to which I need draw the attention of my colleagues Qen,,rai in connection with this Bill.(a) Last year&apos;s Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill as it originally went to theHouse of Lords included a clause abolishing the death penalty for cowardice (and certain other offences) on active service, and for desertion or persuading to desert on active service. The abolition of the death penalty for cowardice (and certain other offences) was a Government proposal : its abolition for desertion or persuading to desert had been decided by a free vote of the House of Commons on a private member&apos;s motion. These changes were in the first instance thrown out after debate by the Lords but reinstated by the Commons and returned to the Lords, hi the second debate in the Lords, Lord Thomson stated that &quot; The observations made in- this House during the debate on Tuesday&quot; (when the changes were thrown out by the Lords) &quot; in view of the great authority of those who made them, will, I can assure your Lordships, be carefully considered by the competent authorities during the next 12 months. That is all I can say oh the subject for the moment, but I hope it will satisfy noble Lords opposite.&quot; The Bill was then passed ; but Lord Salisbury, referring to Lord Thomson&apos;s conciliatory attitude, said, &quot; I earnestly hope that when the Government have the time and opportunity to consider this matter carefully they will decide that the Army Act ought, in a measure at any rate, to be restored to its original form&quot;, and the Lord President of the Council concluded the debate by saying that the matter had been fairly and honestly discussed and that it was an important matter which would be open to reconsideration.I have been in consultation with the Secretary of State for Air on this matter, and we are agreed that there can be no question of re-introducing the death penalty in cases in which it has been abolished. Nor do we think that any proposal should be entertained which seeks to remove the death penalty in the case of those offences (broadly speaking, treachery, mutiny and sedition) for which it at present remains. Since the matter may be raised in both Houses, I think it desirable to remind my colleagues of the facts.(b) The current Army and Air Force (Annual) Act declares that the Army andAir Force Acts shall be in force &quot; within Great Britain and Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, from the 30th April, 1930, to 30th April, 193] &quot; and &quot; Elsewhere -within and without His Majesty&apos;s dominions from the 31st July, 1930, to 31st July, 1931.&quot; The Irish Free State representatives at the Imperial Conference pressed for an alteration in this wording on the ground, I understand, that it was improper for the Parliament at Westminster to pass legislation applying in terms to the Irish Free State.   The Secretary of State for the(B31/8)   60   3/31   W.O.P.   5^754520
Dominions has urged me to meet the Irish Free State wishes, aiid I have accordingly, with the concurrence o  the Secretary of State for Air ,0*/: arranged that for the future the Irish Free State shall be grouped with the other Dominions under the term &quot; elsewhere,&quot; the Army and Air Force Acts running there from July to July instead of from April tq-April. Iu order that there may be no gap between April, 1931, when under the current Act the Army and Air Force Acts expire in the Irish Free State, and July, 1931, a special provision is necessary in this year&apos;s Act by which in effect the currency of the Army and Air Force Acts will be for fifteen months in the Irish Free State (viz., from April, 1931, to July, 1932) instead of for the customary twelve months. A corresponding alteration in the customary long title of the Bill is involved.It is possible that discussion may arise as to the reasons for the change and as to the constitutional principles involved, but, in deference to the views qf the Secretary of State for the Dominions, I have thought it right to make the amendments.3. The Bill, as my colleagues are aware, must receive the Royal Assent by the end of April, and as I understand that-the course of business in the House of Commons may make it desirable that it should pass through all its stages in that -House before Easter, I would ask their concurrence in the circulation of the Bill at the earliest opportunity.Parliamentary Counsel is still in consultation with the legal authorities in Northern Ireland as to the exact wording of Clause 6 (2), and some slight drafting amendment may be necessary hefore the Bill is actually circulated.-r-&apos;i:-1 . - ]t    T.S.The War Office,Uth March, 1931.
Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause 2.In one respect the language of subsection (1) -of this clause differs from that used in previous Annual Acts, which have contained an express reference to Ireland, whilst including the self-governing Dominions, other than the Irish Free State, in the general words &quot; elsewhere, whether within or without His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.&quot; In this, and future years, it is proposed that the express reference should be restricted to Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State being left to fall within the general words. If this alteration is approved, the Army Act will expire as regards the Irish Free State on the 31st July instead of the 30th April. Modifications have been made accordingly in the title and the relevant recital to the Bill.Clause 4.The proviso to section 79 of the Army Act deals with the restoration of forfeited service to a soldier who subsequently performs good and faithful service, or is otherwise deemed by the Army Council to merit restoration, or is recommended for restoration by a court-martial. The proviso to section 161 relates to the same subject. For many years the practice, embodied in The King&apos;s Regulations, par. 246, has been to restore forfeited service as a matter of course to a soldier who is promoted to the rank of sergeant, or has completed three years&apos; service without an adverse entry in his regimental conduct sheet.The object of the amendment is to make it clear that such a case need not be referred to the Army Council, but may Tbe dealt with under general regulations made by them. Where a soldier&apos;s record shows that he has brought himself within the general rules, his case can properly be dealt with by a responsible officer acting in accordance with regulations. Cases not covered by the general rules will still be referred to the Council for special consideration. It is proposed also to correct a small discrepancy in language between the two provisos,75-4 A
one of which refers to &quot;good and faithful service&quot;, whilst the other uses the word &quot; or &quot;.Clause 5.Under section 84 of the Army Act a soldier after serving for nine years may re-engage to complete twenty-one years&apos; service; and when he has completed, or is within one year of completing, the twenty-one years he may under section 85 apply for permission to continue to serve, subject to a right to claim his discharge at any time on giving three months&apos; notice. Section 85, how-ever, as it now stands, gives this privilege only to a soldier who has re-engaged under section 84 to complete twenty-one years&apos; service; and, though most soldiers who have served for twenty-one years have done so under such a re-engagement, there are a few who, having served on two, or more, distinct enlistments, have completed twenty-one years&apos; service without a re-engagement under section 84. The proposed amendment will enable such men to take advantage of the provisions of section 85.Clause 6.Subsection (1).. Section 20 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1930, which, however, does not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland, provides that as from January 1st, 1931, the word &quot;asylum&quot; is to be replaced by the phrase &quot; mental hospital &quot; and the word &quot; lunatic,&quot; except in the phrase &quot; criminal lunatic,&quot; is to be replaced by some such phrase as &quot; person of unsound mind.&quot; The amendr ments proposed will introduce the new phraseology into sections 91 and 130 of the Army Act.Subsection (2). A small amendment is proposed in order to bring the language of section 91 (1) into accord with the present position as regards responsibility for rate-aided lunatics in Northern Ireland.Clause 7.The effect of this clause, coupled with Schedule II, is to make in the Air Force Act similar amendments to those made by the Bill in the Army Act, subject to any necessary modifications arising from the fact that the phraseology of the two Acts and the terms of service in the Army and Air Force are not in all cases identical.
