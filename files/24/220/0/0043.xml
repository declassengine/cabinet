HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1931.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 93 (31).It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.THE REPORT ON THE LOSS OF THE R. 101 AND FUTUREAIRSHIP POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. I PROPOSE to bring the question of airship policy before the Cabinet at an early meeting. Whilst awaiting the report of the Court of Inquiry into the loss of the R. 101, the Air Council have given long and anxious consideration to the various alternative courses open to us in regard to the future of airship development. As a result, I hope to be able, in a memorandum which I shall shortly be circulating, to narrow doAvn the somewhat complex problems involved to a few clear-cut issues, in respect of vdiich I shall submit definite recommendations.2. Meantime it may be convenient to my colleagues to have before them the gist of the report on the loss of the R. 101, which has been presented to me by Sir John Simon and his two assessors, Lieutenant-Colonel Moore-Brahazon and Professor Inglis. The report itself is very exhaustive, and, with its appendices, constitutes a bulky document, running to some 130 pages of print. But I do not think the Cabinet need be troubled with more than the conclusions, and certain &quot; general observations &quot; wrhich are appended by way of supplement to them, and these I accordingly reproduce as an appendix to this memorandum.3.   I desire to draw attention to three points in particular : (a) The loss of the R. 101 is attributed to &quot; substantial loss of gas in verybumpy weather.&quot;    It is further held to be &quot; very probable &quot; (myunderlining) that the sudden (heavy leakage which is considered to have been the immediate cause of the airship&apos;s forced descent &quot; was connected with a specific misfortune, such as the ripping of the fore part of the envelope.&quot; It may, therefore, fairly be said that the disaster was not due to any inherent and ineradicable defect under which airships as such labour and must always continue to labour.(b) It is held to be definitely established that there was no failure (i) of the:structure or (ii) of the control gear.(c) Sir John Simon and his assessors expressly state that it is not for themto make any recommendation in regard to future airship policy-nor does anything emerge in the report in the way of direct or indirect suggestion as to what that policy should be.4. For the rest, there is but one further aspect of the report on which I should like to comment briefly, in fairness to my late predecessor and the experts who accompanied him on the last fatal flight. Some stress is laid on the fact that the full programme of trials originally planned in particular, trials at[5332]
speed and under unfavourable conditions of weather had not been completed. This is undeniably the case, but undue importance should not be attached to the fact.   I desire to point out to my colleagues (a) That the flight to India was in itself definitely experimental and intended to be part of the trials, and it was contemplated that the full speed tests should be carried out in the course of this flight.(&amp;) That there is not a scrap of evidence that the disaster was caused by the non-completion of these trials, or that, if the full programme had been carried out, any factor would have emerged such as to suggest that the Indian flight should be abandoned. It must be remembered that the accident occurred over undulating country in Northern Trance only 216 miles from Cardington in other words, over country andunder conditions certainly no more difficult (if not easier) than wouldhave been encountered in a cruise in similar weather over NorthernEngland, Scotland or Ireland and nearer to the airship&apos;s base.  Theso-called Endurance Flight of the 17th and 18th November, 1929, followed such a route and in all probability a somewhat similar course would have been set, had a further endurance flight been undertaken after the insertion of the new bay. (c) That, as regards the statement that this was &quot; the first flight ever under-taken by any airship to India,&quot; it must be borne in mind that there was a mooring-tower half-way at Ismailia and that the stages Cardington-Ismailia and Ismailia-Karachi are both shorter than Cardington-Montreal, successfully flown by the R. 100. Moreover, whereas the trans-Atlantic flight of this latter ship entailed traversing areas almost uncharted meteorologically, elaborate meteorological data had been accumulated for many months on the Indian route. In short, the trans-Atlantic flight may not unfairly be said to have involved in many ways more unknown factors, and in consequence larger elements of risk, than the Indian flight, despite the fact that the former was successfully completed, whilst the latter ended in disaster.5. If I have made these short comments it is not in any sense by way of criticising the very full and lucid report which Sir John Simon and his colleagues have produced, but merely&apos; by way of elucidation. There are one or two points at which the document is perhaps a little misleading I doubt, for example, whether the Court fully appreciated that the Directorate of Airship Development, though geographically situated at Cardington for purposes of economy and convenience, was constitutionally an integral part of the Air Ministry head-quarters organisation but there is no need to labour these. Indeed, I accept the findings as offering a possible even a probable explanation of the disaster. I feel bound, however, to remind the Cabinet that there are a number of conceivable variants. The Court may well be right in concentrating on gas leakage, and dismissing or minimising other possible causes, main or contributory, such as that the ship was flying too low and encountered a sequence of down draughts or gusts of wholly abnormal severity from which she had not height to recover and/or that there was during her final manoeuvres some other error of navigation or helmsmanship under conditions of peculiar difficulty. But it would be unsafe to dogmatise. In short the plain fact is that the precise cause or causes of the accident can never be determined with certainty; any conclusions must be largely speculations and it is only possible to weigh probabilities. That is what the Court have done to the best of their judgment and ability and I think we are all deeply indebted to them for the ingenuity and assiduity with which they have conducted their investigations. But my colleagues will, I am sure, agree that it is due to those who lost their lives so tragically that there shall be no avoidable misunderstanding of the circumstances of R. 101&apos;s last flight and of the considerations which weighed with those responsible in embarking upon it; and that is why I have circulated these brief notes.A.Air Ministry, April 13, 1931.
APPENDIX.Extracts from Report of the R. 101 Inquiry (Gmd. 3825).&quot; CONCLUSION AS TO  CAUSE.105.   The conclusion reached as to the cause of the disaster is as follows :  The Three Phases.The clearest way in which to explain the theory of the accident which the Court adopts, is to regard the final movements of the E. 101 as consisting of three phases. In the first phase she drops&quot; her nose and descends, at a noticeably steep angle, for half a minute or thereabouts before, by use of up-elevator, she is brought back to an approximately horizontal position. The second phase then begins and continues for a short time during which, in spite of her utmost efforts, she does not succeed in getting her nose appreciably up but continues horizontal until she suddenly passes into a third phase, when she dives again and strikes the ground almost at once at an angle of at least 15 degrees.In seeking the explanation of these successive movements, it is best first to direct attention to the second phase. Notwithstanding that the vessel had lost much height during the first phase, if she had been in a normal condition there seems no reason why she should not have pointed her nose up again and regained altitude. From the fact that she failed to do so, it may be argued most conclusively that she was by then crippled beyond recovery, and the inference is that, though momentarily on an even keel, she was descending rapidly to earth. The action of Chief Coxswain Hunt in leaving the control room to warn.the crew indicates that, in spite of his great experience, his assistance there, was no longer of any use and that those in charge knew there was nothing they could do which would prevent the ship from stranding. And the explanation of this would be provided if she had lost sufficient gas in the fore part of the ship. All that remained was to minimise the impact, and accordingly orders were given to stop the engines and release ballast. If this was the course of events the ship would proceed to put her nose down again, enter upon her second dive and crash. .Now, working back to the first phase, the question is what was the course of events which brought the ship down from say, 1,200 feet, into this first long dive? Inasmuch as the reasoning above set out suggests, and, indeed, practically requires, that at the end of the first dive the vessel had lost a quantity of gas forward, it is natural to assume that this loss of gas had begun before the first phase was entered upon, though it became greater as the vessel descended. If the fore part of the cover had become torn and wind entered the envelope, serious damage to gasbags would be most likely to occur with startling suddenness.The reconstruction of the first phase would therefore be somewhat as follows: Assume that the vessel had become somewhat heavy and was being buffeted in the wind so that her nose was sometimes above and sometimes below the line of horizontal flight. If she had been raised by a buffet, the elevator would be put down by the coxswain who had just come on duty to check and counteract this movement. The coxswain, not yet having got the &quot; feel &quot; of the ship thoroughly, might put his elevator rather more down than was necessary, or keep it down longer than was exactly right. The vessel&apos;s nose would drop. If when her nose is inclined downwards she gets a strong buffet of wind above her nose it will push her nose further down. If she was already heavy from loss of gas especially if a rent had occurred in a gasbag which involved progressively rapid deflation the descent is emphasised. The ship is now on her downward track in the first phase. The coxswain will begin to put his elevator up, and in order to get the ship out of her first dive has to put it up harder. None the less, she does not come out of her first dive as rapidly as she should because she is losing more gas all the time. The slowness of her recovery would give significant warning of the crisis.This gives the explanation of the course of events which is most consistent with the evidence, and at certain points is the -only explanation which readily presents itself in accordance with the facts. At other points it is no doubt possible to assume certain variations in the data. For example, the final dive might have been assisted by another buffet of wind, and the exact relation between the angle of the elevator and the amount of gas lost can never be ascertained by any process of reconstruction.How the vessel began to lose gas can never be definitely ascertained. The weather was exceptionally bad; the gasbags were hard up against padded projections, some of which may have begun to wear the fabric ; the bumpiness of the wind and the pitching of the ship would intensify the strain; and earlier flights had indicated the possibility of leakage through chafing, or, if the vessel rolled through an unusually large angle, through intermittent opening of the gas valves. But it seems very probable that the more serious and sudden loss of gas which followed was connected with a specific misfortune such as the ripping of the fore part of the envelope. Something of this sort had happened on a previous occasion (see para. 41), and no amount of care could secure that it would never happen again.(&apos;)   If a rip had begun in the fore part of the(I) In fact a reference in Colonel RichmoncVs Diary dated 24th September, 1930 (seven clays before the R. 101 came out of her shed for the last time), shows that defects had occurred in a few places on the outer -cover where rubber solution had been used. These defects were analysed and it was discovered that rubber solution when used in conjunction with dope had a tendering or weakening effect on the strength of the coyer ; so much so that it was possible for a man to punch a hole in the fabric with his finger. All these points of possible weakness were, therefore, strengthened by means of reinforcing strips, and the Aircraft Jnspection Department pronounced themselves as satisfied with this remedy.
envelope it would tend to develop into a larger tear which would both check the speed of the R. 101 through the air and expose the gasbags to additional strain. This seems the most probable explanation of a further loss of gas in increasing quantity and suddenness. But whatever the precise circumstances may have been, the explanation that the disaster was caused by a substantial loss of gas in very bumpy weather holds the field. This is the unanimous view of all the three members of the Court of Inquiry.&quot;* ******&quot; 107. Before bringing this Report to a close my colleagues and I desire to add certain general observations.It is clear that if those responsible had been entirely free to choose the time and the weather in which the R. 101 should start for the first flight ever undertaken by any airship to India, and if the only considerations governing their choice were considerations of meteorology and of preparation for the voyage, the R. 101 would not have started when she did. She was undertaking a novel task in weather conditions worse than any to which she had ever been exposed in flight and with the prospect of more unfavourable weather after she started. She had never Dme through trials which proved by their length and conditions that she was well able to cope with a continuance of unfavourable circumstances. The programme of trials drawn up by her Captain had never been carried through, and the intended length of her last trial was avowedly cut down in order to provide a little more time for preparation before the date which was contemplated for her to start for India. No adequate speed trials had ever been carried through, and indeed this fact was so clealy realised that an official of the Air Ministry urged that she should conduct such speed trials on her voyage to India.It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the R. 101 would not have started for India on the evening of the 4th October if it had not been that reasons of public policy were considered as making it highly desirable for her to do so if she could.108. But this is not to say that the authorities, political and technical, who were responsible for, or acquiesced in, this decision, would ever have done so if they had considered that the risk that was being taken was unjustified. The Secretary of State expressly stated that he relied on his experts, and it must never be forgotten that he was entitled to do so. Granted that it must always have been difficult for the distinguished officers at Cardington who sailed in the R. 101 to resist the strongly expressed urging of the secretary  of State that a start should be made in time for him to be a passenger and to return for the Imperial Conference, we do not for a moment believe that Colmore or Scott would have accepted, without the strongest protest, the carrying out of a course which would in their judgment expose the whole enterprise to ruin, and risk the lives of men under their orders as well as those of distinguished passengers, to say nothing of threatening to make havoc of future airship policy. Wing-Commander Colmore&apos;s conversation with the Secretary of State, of which Mr. Eeynold&apos;s notes are convincing evidence, proves this. The real situation can only- be reconstructed by resolutely excluding from the mind the sombre impression produced after the event by the disaster.109. We think the atmosphere in which the decision to start was taken must be regarded as made up of several elements.There was the knowledge possessed by all concerned that the carrying out of this first flight to India was in any case an experiment involving a first experience of conditions which could never be defined and allowed for by theoretic calculations, but must be faced sooner or later by resolute men who believed wholeheartedly in the policy to which it would give expression.There was the influence exerted upon them by- a long period, continually extended by-intervening difficulties and disappointments, during which they had been waiting for the day when the flight could be undertaken a period much greater than had been first anticipated or calculated.There was the knowledge that further developments in Airship policy which might involve expenditure of more public money, the building of more mooring towers, and the construction of a yet bigger airship, the design of which had been already authorised, could not be proceeded with until the existing outlay&apos; was seen to be justified by results.There was the stimulus arising from the fact that the R. 100, notwithstanding considerable gas-leakage and a very alarming experience when over the St. Lawrence River, had made its journey to Canada and back without serious mishap.There was the fact, which never should be overlooked by those who now criticise, that more careful calculations had been made with regard to every part of the R. 101 than &quot;of any previous airship.And there was the personality of the Secretary of State, whose enthusiastic backing of this part of British Air policy must have been from first to last a most comforting support to the Cardington experts, and whose resolution to travel himself in the ship, provided it started at a date which made this possible, gave the cachet of Government support in the most striking way to the enterprise which completely filled the minds and hopes of the Officers who perished.&quot;
