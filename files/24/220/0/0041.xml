IJ \JDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO,0/CABINET  .RECONSTRUCTION OR REPLACEMENT OF WEAK OR NARROW BRIDGES OWNED BY STATUTORY UNDERTAKINGS,ETC sMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport .Both,in Mr. Lloyd George1 s pamphlet *&apos;How to Tackle Unemployment&quot; and in the Interim Report of the Committee on Regional Development,  stress is laid on the desirability of hastening the reconstruction of weak and narrow bridges. Mr. Lloyd George recalls his earlier proposal that a sum of at least  37,000,000 should be spent in two years in recon-structing 7,500 of these bridges, although (page 68) he suggests that &quot;even if this number be reduced to 5,000,  a considerable programme..... is secured.&quot;As I pointed out in October last in paragraph 33 of the Cabinet Memorandum CP. 132 (30) on the Liberal proposals:-&quot;The number of bridges demanding radical reconstruc-tion in the near future should not be exaggerated?    some of the roads on which these bridges exist carry little traffic and it would be extravagant policy to say that every road must be altered to take any vehicles of whatever weight.&quot;As regards the rate of expenditure,  it must be borne in mind that many of these bridges present difficult engineering problems and that it is not possible to have under repair at the same time successive bridges on important lines Of railway,  since otherwise railway traffic would be seriously affected.      Regard must be had also to the intense
dislocation of traffic by road if anything approaching the number of bridges envisaged were under reconstruc-tion at the same time&quot;,I may add. that many narrow bridges which demand careful driving on the part of motorists are not weak bridges in the sense that they forbid the passage of heavy vehicles.Immediately on taking office, by circular letter of 5th July,  1929,  I drew the attention of all concerned to the provisions of the .3rid.ges Act, 1929, facilitating the transfer to highway authorities of bridges,  the restrictions on whose use caused inconvenience and loss to trade and industry;    and I expressed the wish, that &quot;full advantage should be taken cf the opportunity provided by the Act for the systematic improvement or reconstruction of the many weak or ina.deq.uate privately owned bridges on important roads&quot;.The importance attached to this class of work was indicated by the offer of a grant up to 75 per cent of the cost5 and,  in the interest of expedition,  local authorities have been encouraged to employ consulting engineers, whose charges rank as part of the grant earning expenditure.At the Guildhall meeting with local authorities on 25th June;,  1930,   (Cmd., 5616)  I -drew attention to the high level of the normal -grant of 75 per cent for recon-struction of weak bridges owned by statutory authorities; and in other speeches and correspondence I have consistent-ly pressed upon local authorities the urgency of these improvements, while my divisional officers,  following my instructions,  have seconded these efforts in every way.
- o ilIn a circular dated 27th March,  1931,  (dealing generally with the grants to be made during 1931/2 towards improvement and new construction of roads and bridges)  an important section is devoted to the re-construction and replacement of inadequate bridges; and attention is again specially drawn to my readiness to entertain applications for grants up to 75 per cent for works of this character.The Committee on Regional Developments appear to endorse the suggestion of the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Transport that 1,000 weak bridges should be rebuilt every year.      During the financial year just closed the number of weak bridges dealt with has probably reached a total of 600,  thanks to the assistance given from the Road Fund;    and it is due to no want of effort on the part of my Department that the figure of 1,000 was not attained.      No application from local authorities for assistance on the appropriate scale (75 per cent) towards a satisfactory scheme has been rejected.The Road Fund Budget for the financial year just closed included (as shewn on page 29 of the Road Fund Report for 1929/50) am allocation of  500,000 for this purpose;    and the actual grants made during the year amounted to over  498,500, while futher &quot;indications&quot; have been made totalling over  525,000.In the Road Fund Budget    for 1931/2 I am again including a sum of  500,000 for this service.While it is easy to put forwards  in political pamphlets or in Committee Reports, theoretical recommen-dations for bridge programmes of some definite magnitude,
on the practical side it is necessary to remember that the Minister of Transport has no direct means of rendering such programmes effectiveo      The bridges are not under my control, nor even,  in the majority of cases, under that of the local authorities.      Most of them belong to railway and canal companies, with whom the local authorities must negotiate before re-building can be undertaken.      These negotiations are facilitated by the passing of the Bridges Act,  1929, but there are usually a number of technical and ad-ministrative problems to be studied before a feasible scheme can be evolved.      The railway company may desire provision made for additional lines;    the canal company mar/ wish to widen its waterway or to secure greater headroom;    the question may even arise as to the de-sirability of building the new bridge on an entirely fresh site.      The consequential improvement of the approaches to an old bridge usually involves demolition and rehousing, which always have a retarding effect.Even,   therefore,    if the bridges were under my direct control,  the delay in the execution   of these schemes would be considerable.      As matters stand,  all that I can do is to bring influence to bear on local authorities and encourage them by preferential rates of grants which, however, must bear some relation to the general policy of the Department and the apportionment of responsibility between the Government and the local authorities.      /
The grants of 75 per cent now available are    obviously generous,  if we bear in mind that the normal contribution-bution from the Road Fund towards maintenance and improvement of class I roads is 63 per cent and to class II roads 50 per cent.      Any substantial increase beyond 75 per cent would be tantamount to relieving local authorities of one important branch of their highway responsibilities and this step would be likely to lead to a demand for a general shifting of the b-upden of road administration.It is disappointing to me that local authorities, generally speaking, have so far shewn no great alacrity in submitting comprehensive bridge programmes but it is common knowledge that a policy of retrenchment is widely prevalent among local authorities whose various spending committees are being rigorously rationed,      While,  therefore, dangerous bridges are receiving attention,  there is a tendency to postpone the improvement of structures which are merely inconvenient.    The LGcal Government Acts of 1929 have, however, brought within the scope of larger and better equipped authorities bridges which were formerly the concern of minor authorities with slender resources; definite programmes for dealing with weak bridges in their areas have been undertaken by the County    Councils of Surrey and Lancashire:    and I am not without hope that the concentration of highway powers in County Councils and County Borough Councils may have the effect of producing greater activity generally in the matter of bridge reconstruction, when the new administrative machinery is in full running order,      Up to the present, however,  the dislocation of machinery: Inevitable in the early stages
of a change over under the Local Government -Acts has militated against rapid acceleration of the bridge programme,I am giving careful consideration to recommendations of the Royal Commission on Transport (pages 203-4)for certain amendments of the Bridges Act. 1929, as to the financial terms of transfer of bridges to highway   authorities but I do not think it will be possible to ask in the very near future for  the Parliamentary time necessary for any amending legislation which may appear to be required. In the hope, however,  of mitigating some of the special difficulties presented by bridge schemes affecting structures owned by railway companies, my officers have recently conferred with representatives of the railways with a view to formulating certain standard clauses,  the use of which will shorten the negotiations when individual agreements for bridge reconstruction are being discussed between railway companies and local authorities.&quot;While, as I have indicated above, the work so far put in hand falls short of what I might have, wished for&quot;, I submit that work actually begun on a total of 600 weak bridges within one year is no mean achievement;    and it is not unreasonable to hope for an improvement upon this figure in the present financial year*      To this end I am renewing my instructions to my staff to keep the attention of all local authorities focussed upon this subject.(Intld)    H.M.th April,  1931.
