THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1931.SECRET. Copy No.     &amp;CP. 78 (31).CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.Fourteenth Session- 1930.Proposed Action on the Draft Convention relating to Forced or compulsory Labour.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theMinister of Labour,AS our colleagues are aware, there have been several enquiries in Parliament as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in regard to the ratification of the Draft Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour, which was adopted at the Fourteenth Session of the International Labour Conference in June last. The text of the Convention has already been presented to Parliament in Cmd. 3693.This Convention differs from other International Labour Conventions in that it was drafted with a view- primarily to the conditions prevailing in Colonial dependencies. In regard, therefore, to this particular Convention, our obligations under Article 421 of the Treaty of Versailles assume a special importance.  That Article provides that : &quot; 1. The Members engage to apply conventions which they have ratified in accordance with&quot; the provisions of this Part of the present Treaty to their colonies, protectorates and possessions which are not fully self-governing :(1) Except where owing to the local conditions the convention is inapplicable, or(2) Subject to such modifications as may be necessary to adapt the convention to local conditions.&quot;In view also of the special character of this1 Convention, a provision was inserted in it (Article 26) providing that, if any^Member of the international abour Organisation desires to take advantage of the provisions of Article 421 of the Treaty of Versailles &quot; It shall append to its ratification a declaration stating :(1) The Territories to which it intends to apply the provisions of this Convention without modification;(2) The Territories to which it intends to apply the provisions of this Convention with modifications, together with details of the said modifications;(3) The Territories in respect of which it reserves its decision.&quot;[5255]
If we had ratified the convention but with a reservation in respect of any important African Colony, our action would undoubtedly have been open to serious misrepresentation. In spite, therefore, of some pressure from the Director of the International Labour Office, we thought it best to hold our hands until we were in a position to say whether any modifications of the Convention would be required in its application to any of the Dependencies. We are happy to be able to inform our Colleagues that it has now been ascertained that the Convention can be applied without any modifications in all the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories for the administration of which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is responsible, including the three South African territories, Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland, which fall within the sphere of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.There is, therefore, no longer any obstacle to our ratification of this Convention, and we suggest that we be authorised to apply for the necessary Order of Council and to communicate the ratification to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.It is proposed also to accept the Recommendation concerning indirect compulsion to labour, and the Recommendation concerning the regulation of forced or compulsory labour, the texts of which were also presented to Parliament in Cmd. 3693 (1930).If our proposals are accepted, the Governments intentions will be communicated to Parliament as usual by means of a White Paper.P.M. G. B.Colonial Office, Ministry of Labour,March 26, 1931.
