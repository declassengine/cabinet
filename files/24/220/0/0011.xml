CUMENTIS^THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S f&amp;vffWENT)COPY NO.CAB I N E T.COMMITTEE ON THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF DISARMAMENT.SECOND REPORT.lo At their Meeting on the 30th July, 1930,  (Cabinet46 (30) Conclusion 10), the Cabinet gave general approval to the Conclusions contained in our first Report (Paper C.Pe  261 (30)).2. Among the proposals dealt with in that Report wasone that special grants supplementary to the normal grants payable for relief works,should be paid to local authorities to finance schemes for workpeople displaced by the closing of establishments as a result of Disarmament policy.      Our views on this suggestion were set out in paragraph 31 of CP.  261 (30), as follows  :-&quot;We see great objection to the suggestion that within the area of particular Local Authorities a class of unemployed workpeople should be given exceptional preferential treatment in regard to relief works.    Y/e also think that in practice it would be almost impossible to justify differentiating between the unemployment caused by disarmament or the rationalisation of armaments supply, and unemployment due to other causes.    We doubt, moreover, whether it would be found possible in practice to organise special relief works on the lines suggested&quot;.3. On the 20th November, 1930, we informed a deputation from the Joint Disarmament Committee of the views of theGovernment on the various proposals, and at the Deputation&apos;special request, we agreed to re-examine the question of grants for distressed armament areas in consultation with theMinisters of Health and Labour and the Secretary of State forScotland.4. Wo attach (Appendix I)  a Note by the Ministers inquestion, from which it will be seen that the administrativeE T.1511-
pbjcctions to the proposal are well-nigh insuperable-, aand1 thatstrong reasons exist for the view that no further general assistance in relief of rates at the present time can be justified.      Ye are in agreement with the conclusions reached &quot;by our colleagues, and we accordingly are unable to recommend the Cabinet to reconsider the decision reached in regard to this matter at the meeting on the 30th July last,the final decision of the Government on the question, and we are agreed that the best course will be to send that Committee a reasoned reply in writing in order that there may be no possibility of any misunderstanding in regard to the attitudedrart reply based on the material contained in Appendix I, which we suggest should be sent to the Joint Disarmament Committee.Owing to his absence abroad it has not been possible to obtain the concurrence of the First Lord of the Admiralty in the terms of this Report^ but we have no reason to suppose that he would dissent from the conclusions which we have reached.      We attach importance to a reply being sent to the Joint Disarmament Committee as soon as possible after the First Lord&apos;s return to EnglandoWe accordingly recommend the Cabinet  ;-To approve the despatch to  the Joint Disarmament Committee of a reply on the question    of grants to areas distressed as a result of disarmament policy,  in the form of the draft contained in Appendix II to this Report,  on the understanding that the assent of the First Lord of the Admiralty to this recommendation will be obtained on his return to England.The Joint Disarmament Committee ing for of the Government on the matter.We attach (-appendix II) a(Signed)  T.

i r19APPENDIX   I. , 1 8 0GRANT^ FOR piSTFJlSSSD AREAS,Note by the Ministry of Health., the Ministry of Labourand the Scottish 0ffIeeoO   V O   O   S   V cThe proposal made hy the Deputation from the Joint Disarmament Committee of the T0U0C0 which was examined in the report of the Cabinet Committee on the Economic Consequences of Disarmament (0oPo 261 (30)) was that grants should he given to the Local Authorities for the areas affected specifically for the purpose of putting in hand works for the employment of men displaced from the armament works.      This proposal was fully dealt with in a memorandum prepared hy the Ministry of Labour and appended to the Committee?s report (Appendix IV (C Po26l(30))The wider proposal now made is that a new general grant should be. given to the Local Authorities for the areas affected presumably in aid of the extra expenditure incurred by the Authorities in tho relief of the distress caused by the displacement of workpeople as a result of disarmament policy. Such a grant would be a necessitous areas grant for a selected lumber of aregs.In the first place, even if it were established that additional grants in aid of local government wore necessary, it -would be impossible to discriminate between areas in the way suggested;-    to give grants to districts affected by disarmament policy and to withhold them from ether districts, possibly   ^   -more heavily burdened.The question of giving specific grants to necessitous areas has been under consideration for many years and only as recently as 12th November, 1930; the Minister received a deputation on the subject from a very influential Committee of Members of Parliament and representatives of Local Authorities - the National Necessitous Areas Committee.
Ministry of Health.20th December.,   1950.It has a Iways,  of ccnip&amp;e.  been a -matter of the gr-oatetst difficulty to -d-efino a neexvs^ktcrua area- and no. satisfactory definition has over been framed.    But even the authorities which regard themselves as necessitous realise that to-day their claim for special assistance is weaker than it kas ever be^n.    Apart from the very substantial benefit which the more heavily burdened areas hav* received under the financial provisions of the Local Government Act. considerable relief of local burdens has .been given by the Unemployment Insurance Act of last Session, and by the; largely increased grants for unemployment works.Tho financial position of local authorities in the depressed areas is undoubtedly much less serious thajx^it was a year or two ago and it is suggested that no further general assistance in relief of rates at the present time can be justified.
Dear Mr. Harries,You -will remember that on the 16th February, you wrote to me enquiring whether Mr. Shaw and his colleagues could now give a decision on the question of grants for areas especially distressed in consequence of disarmament policy, which was discussed at the meeting between the Cabinet Committee and your Joint Disarmament, Committee on the 20th November  last..As was pointed out on that occasion,  this question is one which specially concerns the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Labour, and after the meeting steps were taken to obtain the views of those three Mix^ministers.In effect the proposal is that a necessitous areas grant should be given to a number of selected areas in aid of the extra expenditure incurred by the authorities for those areas in the relief of the distress caused by the displacement of workpeople as a result of disarmament policy.Apart altogether from the question of principle, the views expressed to the Cabinet Committee by the three Ministers named above, make it clear that the administrative difficulties of giving effect to the proposal are of so serious a character that its successful operation must be regarded as highly problematical,  if not impossible.Even if it could be established that additional grants in aid of local government were necessarj&apos;&apos;,  it would be impossibleAPPBKDIX^ IX.COMMITTEE ON THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF DISARMAMENT.Draft reply proposed to be addressed to the Secretary of the Joint Disarmament Committee of the T.U.C. by the Secretary to the Committee.
ti Qi jl O -lto discriminate., betrweor  .reajs...in.- -th e way&quot; suggested, and to give grants to districts affected by disarmament policy and to withhold them from.other districts possibly more heavily burdened.    It should also be observed that even the authorities which regard themselves as necessitous realise that today their claim for special assistance is weaker than it has been in the past0    Apart from the very substantial benefit which the more heavily burdened areas have received, under the financial provisions of the Local Government Act,  considerable relief of local burdens has been given by the Unemployment Insurance Act of last Session, and by the largely increased grants for Unemployment works..While the members of the Cabinet Committee fully appreciate the value of your proposal., they feel ccmpelleel to agree with the considered opinion of the Ministers of . Health and Labour and the Secretary of State for Scotland, that its benefits could not be confined to areas distressed in consequence of disarmament policy, and they much regret that they have not found it possible to recommend the Cabinet to adopt the suggestion.I am,  etc.E.P.Harries Esq..,
