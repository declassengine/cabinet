9Q0&amp; 0 ijjjirg DOCUMENT IS f113E PROPERTY OF BJ.S BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SSCR3JMCABINET.Coalmining_Situation.Unemployment Insurance Benefit. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour,COPY NO*o.4AOI circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a precis of the decisions given by the Umpire on claims to benefit made by workers in the South&quot;Wales and Scottish coalfields in connection with the stop-pages which took place in those fields in January and December last respectively.In the case of the South Wales stoppage &quot;benefit was disallowed, while in the case of the Scottish stoppage benefit was allowed.        The reasons for these opposite decisions are given in the precis.In the present situation any worker refusing to accept employment after 31st March on terms which involve a spread-over would become entitled to benefit.        If, however, an alternative offer based on legal hours is made &quot;before 31st March and is refused &quot;benefit would not &quot;be payable. But if the only offer from the employers is for work on a spread-over basis, benefit will be payable if a stoppage follows, and the consequential charge on the Fund might be very large indeed.(Initd.) M.G.B.24th march , 1951.
p o summary OP UMPIRE&apos;S DECISION. &quot; U 0(A)    SOUTH WALES STOPPAGE.The Insurance Officer originally disallowed benefit in a test case on the ground that the disqualification under Section 8(l) of the Unemployment Insurance Act,  1920,  applied as the claimant had lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the premises at which he was employed..      The Court of Referees allowed benefit cn appeal by the claimant, hut the Insurance Officer appealed against this allowance to the Umpire.The facts were stated in the Umpire5&apos;s decision as follows;When the Coal Mines Act of 1930 came into operation on 1st December,  1930?  the existing agreements in South Wales ceased to be operative.      It had been agreed during November, 1950 that work should continue on day to day contracts during December, but as this agreement provided for eight hours work a day, with a Saturday off each fortnight?  it was contrary to the provisions of Section 14(l) of part III of the Goal Mines Act,195 owing to the requirement of the proviso to that Section not having been complied with.On 31st December, 1930,  the colliery owners posted at the various pits the terms which they were prepared to make as from 1st January,  1931.      It is not suggested that those terms infringed the conditions of the Coal Mines Act,  1930,  or of any other Act of Parliament.The posted terms provided for a reduction of wages consequen upon a reduction of hours.      They were therefore not acceptable to the South Wales miners Federation whose members did not present themselves for work on 1st January,  and work was net resumed until 19th Januaryc      Prior to 1st January there had been attempts to agree the wages and conditions in the coalfield but without success.
9 Q AIt was argued on &quot;behalf of the claimants that the loss of employment was not the result of a stoppage due to a trade dispute, but was brought about by the &quot;basis of working prior to 50th November, 1930, being destroyed by statute&quot;.      Further,   as the employment during the month of December was illegal,  it was to be ignored, from which it would follow that the claimants &apos; employment must be deemed to have terminated on 30th November, and that therefore he could not be deemed to have lost employment on 1st January, 1931, by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute.The Umpire did not accept either of these contentions.     He said that,  accepting the contention on the claimant1 s behalf that his employment during the month of December was illegal,  it was being suggested that by the commission of a series of illegal acts he had acquired a right to unemployment benefit which he would not have possessed had his employment been legal.      That, the Umpire said, was opposed to a firmly- established principle of law that &quot;a man shall not have advantage of his own wrong to gain a favourable interpretation of the law&quot;.The Umpire sadd that the only question for determination was whether the employment v/as lost by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute.      The employment was lost through the claimant and others withdrawing their labour.      This caused the stoppage.      They withdrew their labour because thejr were not prepared to accept the reduction of wages on which the employers were insisting.      This was,  in the words of Section 47 of the Unemployment Insurance Act,  1920, which defines a trade dispute, &quot;a dispute between employers and employees which is connected with the terms of employment&quot;.Accordingly the Umpire held that the claimant v/as disqualifie for receiving benefit from 1st to 18th January,  end the decision of the Court of Referees must be reversed.This decision was given in the case of an underground worker. A later decision deals with the surface workers and disallows benefit.S.
9 c0(B) SCOTTISH STOPPAGE,The decision in the case of the Scottish coalfields was also taken on a test case in which the Insurance Officer had first disallowed benefit on the ground that the claimant was disqualified under the trade dispute clause of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.      In the case in which the Umpire1s decision was given the Court of Referees had upheld the Insurance Officer&apos;s decision and the claimant appealed to the Umpire.        In other cases, however,  the Court of Referees had given decisions allowing benefit. Prom these decisions the Insurance Officer appealed.As in the South Wales cases,   the agreements between the colliery owners and their employees ceased to operate as from 1st December, 1930, when Part III of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, came into operation.      Meetings had been held some time prior to 1st December, 1930, at which endeavours had been made, without success,  to agree future terms of employment.       At the crucial meeting on 29th November, 1930, an endeavour was made to reach a temporary agreement for the continuation of work after 1st December,  in order that, while the temporary agreement sub-sisted, further discussions might take place for a permanent settlement.      At the meeting on 29th November, the employers stated that they proposed to open the pits on 1st December &quot;on the same conditions as they are open to-day except that we do not propose to work any pit more than 11 days in the fortnight&quot;,At the hearing before the Umpire it was agreed on behalf of the Insurance Officer that the employers&apos; proposal offended against the provisions of Section 14(1) of the Coal Jiines Act, 1930, because it entailed working eig;ht hours a day, and the proviso to that Section could not operate because a necessary party had refused approval to the &quot;spread-over&quot;.      In fact the employers had admitted on 29th November that their proposal meant breaking the letter of the law.On 1st December the employers posted notices at the pitsthat as from 15 days after that date the wages to be paid would be -3.
(1)  if 7-g hours are worked, 76ft above the 1,888 basis;(S)  if a spread-over of 11 days a fortnight of 8 hours a day are worked,  95% above the 1,888 basis. No reference was made in the notice of 1st December to the terms and conditions which were to prevail between 1st and 15th December.    The Umpire assumed that the reason for this was that the employers intended to adhere to their statement at the meeting on 29th November as to the terms on which the pits would be opened on 1st December.It was contended before the Umpire that the temporary terms on offer between 1st and 15th December were either (l)  above, or the temporary terms stated by the employers at the meeting on 29th November and admitted to be in breach of the statute.      The Umpire states, however,  that he was informed by a representative of the employers that the only terms on which they were prepared to open their pits on 1st December were those stated at the meeting.As, therefore, the only offer open to the men for the period from 1st to 15th December was the illegal offer of a spread-over,  the Umpire decided that as the stoppage of work resulted from a refusal of the workmen to work under conditions which would have involved a breach of a statutory provision, employment was not lost by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute and that there was consequently no disqualification for the receipt of benefit under Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.Shortly, the reason for the difference between the decisions in the two cases is that while in both cases the offer included working on spread-over,  in the one case there was no alternative, while in the other there, was an alternative which was an offer of employment on legal terms.
