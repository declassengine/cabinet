Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1931. SECRET. Copy -No.5cp. 67 (31).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE:   POSITION OF Mr. NORMAN BENTWICH,  THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE situation in Palestine remains tense, and Arab feeling is reported to be embittered. Accordingly, in view of tbe political considerations involved, I am iafraid that I must bring before my colleagues a question which at first sight may appear to be one with which the Cabinet ought not to be troubled. The question is the termination of the appointment of Mr. Norman Bentwich as Attorney-General of Palestine, and the possible political consequences of dispensing with the services of a prominent Jew and Zionist.Ever since the disturbances in the Summer of 1929, the position of Mr. Bentwich as Attorney-General has been a source of embarrassment to the Palestine Administration, and the situation there remains so difficult that the embarrassment tends to increase rather than diminish. While the Prime Minister&apos;s recent letter to Dr. Weizmann has gone far to meet the complaints of the moderate Jews, it has met with a very hostile reception from the Arabs, who consider that the Government has yielded to Jewish political pressure. In such an atmosphere it is impossible for the Palestine Administration to carry on its work and hold the scales evenly between the races and religions of Palestine if the Attorney-General is an ardent Zionist (or, for that matter, an ardent anti-Zionist). In this connection it is important to observe that in the prosecution of the numerous offenders in the 1929 disturbances, the administration was gravely hampered by not being able to make use of the services of its Attorney-General, owing to his being a Jew, and that, similarly, he was unable to be used for the important work of preparing the Palestine Governments case for the Shaw Commission.Mr. Bentwich has been on leave from Palestine since the summer, and since then he has been kept at home on full pay in view of the danger of his return to Palestine leading to some unfortunate incident, or even more serious trouble. The High Commissioner is strongly opposed to &quot;his being allowed to resume duty as Attorney-General, and says that his return to Palestine would cause a new-outburst of political agitation and of Arab insistence on his removal from office. Sir J. Chancellor points out that this would be most embarrassing to the Govern-ment, since it would be impossible thereafter to secure his retirement without an appearance of yielding to clamour, and he recommends that if he cannot be persuaded to accept employment elsewhere, he should be compulsorily retired on pension.Mr. Bentwich is a man who deserves every consideration, and this he has received.   On no less than two occasions in the last twelve months he has been offered high promotion in other Colonies, but on each occasion he has declined the offer on the ground that he does not wish to leave Palestine.   The present [5190]
position is that Mr. Bentwich has been told semi-officially that he must not return to Palestine as Attorney-General, and he has been granted full-pay leave up till the end of April. Further, although no legal provision exists, it is contemplated that he should be granted a pension on retirement.In all the circumstances, I feel that it might be disastrous if the Colonial Office were to allow Mr. Bentwich to return to Palestine as Attorney-General. On the other hand, the termination of his services will almost certainly provoke an outcry from the Jewish side. I am of opinion, however, that the latter is the lesser of the two evils, and that it must be faced, and I am not personally prepared to take the responsibility of overruling the High Commissioner and allowing this officer to return to Palestine as Attorney-General. I accordingly propose, unless my colleagues are definitely opposed to this course, now to inform Mr. Bentwich finally that his services will terminate at the end of April. I append a brief statement of the events leading up to the present position.P.Colonial Office, March 12, 1931.
APPENDIX.Events Leading up to the Present Situation.Mr. NORMAN BENTWICH, O.B.E., M.C., has served in legal posts in Palestine since 1918, and has been Attorney-General since 1922.In September 1929 the High Commissioner reported that the Chief Justice of Palestine felt strongly that the Government was being seriously hampered by Mr. Bentwich holding the post of Attorney-General, as he was not only a Jew but also known as an ardent partisan of Zionism. The High Commissioner was not, however^ at that time prepared to ask Mr. Bentwich to resign.On the 2nd October, 1929, a one day strike of Arabs was ordered by the Arab Executive Council of Palestine as a protest against the retention of Mr. Bentwich.On the 24th November, 1929, Mr. Bentwdch was shot at and slightly wounded by an Arab Government messenger.In March 1930 Mr. Bentwich was offered promotion to the post of Chief Judge, Mauritius, but refused the offer on the ground that he did not seek a career in the Colonial Service as his interests were centred in Palestine and he did not desire to leave that country.In June 1930 Sir J. Chancellor said that he proposed to tell Mr. Bentwich that he thought the time had come for him to resign, and that his presence in his office was embarrassing to the Administration. The Secretary of State concurred in the proposal, and it was then understood that Mr. Bentwich was willing to resign.Later on in the summer of 1930, it was ascertained that Mr. Bentwich had changed his mind about being willing to resign, and, with the concurrence of the High Commissioner, the consideration of his retirement was postponed until the autumn.In November 1930 it was explained to Mr. Bentwich that in view of the situation in Palestine it would not be in the public interest for him to return there as Attorney-General, and he was sounded as to whether he would accept promotion to the Chief Justiceship of Cyprus. Mr. Bentwdch at first seemed attracted by the idea, but asked permission to think it over, and on the following day refused the offer on the plea that he did not wish to leave Palestine. At the same time he said he recognised that it might be necessary for him to be retired, but asked that the date of his retirement should be postponed until the summer of 1931. The High Commissioner, who was consulted, telegraphed to the Secretary of State strongly opposing any idea that Mr. Bentwich should be allowed to return to duty as Attorney-General, and his opposition has been recently repeated in a private letter.In view of the critical position of the negotiations with the Jews, it was not even possible to allow- Mr. Bentwich to return to Jerusalem to pack up his belongings, because if he had done this the fact of his impending retirement would have become public at once. Since then Mr. Bentwich has been kept at home on full pa)&apos; and his services have been made use of in legal matters by the Colonial Office.  He has been promised full pay leave until the end of April.
