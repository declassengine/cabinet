nOClMENT JSJTHE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAhNIC MAJESTY18 GOVERNMENT)H E TIg7 (51),.COPY NO,C A B I N E T,COMMITTEE ON EXPORT OE WAR MATERIALS AMD WARSHIPS&quot;.REPORT,At their Meeting on fhe 17th December, 1930, (Cabinet 75 (30)  Conclusion 7), the Cabinet agreed that the question of the export of &quot;war materials and warships and kindred matters raised in the papers before the Cabinet and at the Cabinet Meeting, should be referred for consideration by a Cabinet Committee composed as followsThe Lord Privy seal the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Secretary of State for WarThe Secretary of State for air the First Lord of the admiralty the President of the Board of Trade,andThe Prime Minister recently invited the Lord Privy Sea], to fill the vacancy on the Committee caused by the death of Mr0 Vernon Hartshorn, and to act as Chairman of the Committee,In addition to the documents which were under consider-ation by the Cabinet in December last, the Committee have been furnished by the three Service Departments with information as to the very serious position of the British armament firms in the face of the severe and growing foreign competition for armament orders of all kinds.    While absolute proof must necessarily be lacking,  there seems little doubt that three of the four important European firms (Ansaldo, Schneider and Skoda) are able to undertake foreign armament work by reason of the
fact that  they can obtain financial facilities from- their&quot;&quot;&quot; respective Governments, while the remaining firm (Bofors of Sweden)  is in a specially favourable position to tender &quot;successfully for armament contracts.    There is no doubt that these, and other foreign firms, succeed in obtaining armament orders (both from European countries and from countries outside Europe) which formerly came to this country, and that tho decline in our armament industries is a cause of unemployment.The Committee have also been informed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that, in his view, it would be most undesirable for the Government at this stage to take any action to facilitate, the export of war material from this country, and that in particular it would be politically impracticable and wholly inconsistent with their principles and their policy, for the Government to promote legislation to extend the export credit facilities guarantee scheme to the export of war material and warships.While the Committee agree with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it is impracticable to introduce legislation to reverse the Act of 1921 in this respect, they consider that the expression &quot;munitions of war&apos;  in Section 2 of that Act should not be interpreted as applying to aircraft or other articles or parts thereof, which are unarmed, which contain no armament fittings, and which are capable of being used for civil purposes,,At the request of the Committee, Sir H.J. Wilson and Vice-Admiral Backhouse have conferred with representatives of the shipbuilding firms.
this conference,  it appeared that it was now customaryfor countries ordering warships abroad to demand long terms of credit for their payments,  sometimes as much as ten years, and that very few,  if any, British firms could ever undertake orders on these terms.      The firms Could not obtain advances from their bankers for building foreign warships as the banks declined to regard a warship as a marketable security.      The financial aspects of the matter have been taken up with Mr. E.R.Peacock of Messrs. Baring Brothers, and these discussions are still in progress.The Committee submit the following conclusions tothe Cabinet:-(1)    The Committee are unable to recommend the Cabinet to promote legislation for the repeal of the provision in Section 2 of the Trade Facilities Act, 1921, prohibiting the application of the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme to export transactions in respect of the sale of munitions of war.(2)    The Committee, however, do not consider-that this prohibition extends to aircraft or other articles or parts thereof, which are unarmed, which contain no armament fittings, and which are capable of being used for civil purposes.(3)    The Committee are awaiting a further Report from the First Lord of the Admiralty and the President of the Board of Trade on enquiries instituted hy them in the case of Messrs. Baring Brothers and other financial houses,  regarding the possibility of financial assistance being given by those institutions to the armament firms in respect of foreign orders for warships and other munitions of war.Signed on behalf of the Committee,THOMAS JOHNSTON. CHAIRMAN.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.Y/...1.9th April,  1931.
