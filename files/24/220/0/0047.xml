SCIENTIFIC TREATMSTNT AND UTILISATION OF COAL Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines-.I have for some time had under consideration the general question of what may he termed the more scientific treatment and utilisation of coal,   including particularly such matters as Low Temperature Carbonisation;, Hydrogenation of Coal, and the Use of Pulverised Coal,   and the time has arrived in my view when the Cabinet should be asked to review the policy of the Government in regard to this question.    The Mines Department is bound to be primarily interested in the processes referred to from the point of view of their effect on the coal mining industry.,    Some of the efforts which are being made are undoubtedly directed to securing a more economical use of coal,,    To the extent that these efforts are successful,  the immediate result is a reduction in the amount of Coal used and benefits can only accrue to the coal mining industry as the results of improved methods of using coal lead to a lowering of fuel costs and a consequential increase in the demand. The efforts are,  however,  also directed to securing the substitution of cool for oil, whether in the use of pulverised coal in place of oil fuel or in the actual production of oil from coal; the success of these efforts will obviously be of more direct benefit to the industry,.    But in any event the efforts which consumers of coal are always making to secure a more eoonomical use of it and the gradually increasing competition which coal has to meet from other fuels make it of the first importance that the Mines Department should keep under review all modern developments of treatment and utilisation of coal.,In this matter a special Branch of the Department which I have recently formed will work in conjunction with the Fuel Research Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. But in addition to the action which can be taken in the ordinary course of Departmental routine I t hink there are certain directions in which a moce aotjve policy by the Government may encourage the
development of the processes with &quot;benefit to the coal miningindustry and to the country generally,  and it is with this aspect of the question that I desire to deal in this memorandum.Low Temperature OarbgnAgat-lpa. .Much attention has heen directed during the past ten or twelve years to the development of low temperature carbonisation.    This hasbeen due,  according to the annual Report of the Department oficieniilfic and Industrial Research issued in February last to&quot;the attractive possibilities it offers as a means of producing a free-burning,  smokeless fuel,  and a tar which is more suitable than that obtained from gas retorts or coke-ovens for&apos; use as fuel oil or as a source of motor spirit&quot;.,It is generally admitted that the primary technical difficultiesassociated with low temperature carbonisation processes have Seenovercome,   and several processes have heen developed to a commercialscale.    The present position is summarised in the following paragraphtaken from the Repc rt- of the fuel Research Board issued in december last,,&quot;Information as to the commercial possibilities cf low temperature carbonisation is slowly, but steadily,  accumulating, though the time is not yet when its true place in the carbonisation industries can be defined.    It has been pointed out before in the reports of the Director of Fuel Research that the possibilities of success of any particular process depend on the local circumstances,  and that the type of process must be capable of producing,  from the available coal, prodrj.cts for which there is a local demand.&quot;Low temperature processes produce a semi-coke fuel which    is easily ignitible,  gas in considerable quantities from which a certain amount of motor spirit can be obtained,  and tar oil from vfeicL. fuel oil and motor spirit is obtainable.    .a market must be found for all these at a price which,  if the process is to be financially possible, must cover the cost of the coal plus the costs of the process.    As the semi-coke and gas are bound to come into competition with raw coal&apos; and gas produced by high temperature carbonisation processes, the main advantage to the coal industry will broadly speaking be in the reduction of heat value cf the raw coal represented by the extraction from each ton of coal carbonised of some 20 gallons of tar oil and motor spirit,  or about 10 per cent of the coal carbonised.
Given favourable conditions it is considered that it should be practicable for low temperature carbonisation to be developed to the advantage of the mining industry, although in the present state of scientific knowledge, it cannot be claimed that the advantage is likely within a period which can be foreseen to be really substantial.   At the same time the substitution of a smokeless yet free burning fuel would be of great advantage to the health of the community, and the additional cleanliness of the large towns would bring a considerable saving to the public generally and to municipal corporations,   For these reasons such encouragement as is possible should be given by the Government to stimulate the commercial development of low temperature carbonisation,,It may be asked, if low temperature carbonisation processes have been developed to the commercial stage, why they cannot proceed to the next stage of commercial exploitation on an economic basis without assistance from the Government.    One reason is that the tar oils from which so much was expected, and which, when commercial exploitation first began, were able to command a price of from 6dc to l/- a gallon, are now difficult to dispose of at a higher price than lgd. to 2d, a gallon.    This is mainly due to the heavy fall in the price of all oil products which has taken place and if there were no chance of improving the value of these coal tar oils it would be exceedingly difficult, except under very favourable conditions, for low temperature carbonisation to become an economic proposition.another reason is that it will take time to educate the public as to the desirability of burning smokeless fuel in place of raw coal.    Its use is growing and information is available indicating that those who have tried it over a period in domestic grates are satisfied that it is preferable to raw coal and are indeed prepared to pay a higher price per ton for it than for coal.    The time will
probably come in the not distant future when the Government of the day will decide that it is against the national interest to burn raw coal for domestic purposes and will prohibit it. But before this could be done it would be essential to secure that proper supplies of smokeless fuel were available. This would entail the development of low temperature carbonisation processes on a large scale, involving very big capital expenditureo    If the economics of the process were established; there would in my view be a strong case for special steps being taken by the Government to assist in securing this large scale development,-    Matters have not yet however advanced sufficiently to justify such action,The late Government was attracted by the idea of providing financial assistance to hasten the commercial development of low temperature carbonisation and guaranteed the capital and interest on a loan of  100,000 under the Trade Facilities Acts to enable an experiment on a commercial scale to be carried out at the Richmond Gas Works by the Gas Light ec Coke Company.I expressed the view at the time that this experiment was wrongly conceived,    It has proved to be a failure and I have given the reasons for tnis in the memorandum (C.P*62(31)) recently submit tod. to the Cabinet o    The Cabinet agreed that the experiment should bo discontinued and in present circumstances I do not suggest that any other experiment of a similar kind should be undertaken,    The policy of the present Government is not to grant direct financial assistance to private enterprise, and I do not suggest that any departure from that policy is desirable in the case of low temperature Carbonisation, The possibility of linking low temperature carbonisation processes with gas or electricity undertakings and so securing the assistance which may under certain conditions be given under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929, has not been overlooked, and the use of this procedure has been
$suggested to some concerns working low temperature carbonisation ifwhich have asked for financial assistance.Nevertheless the results obtained in the Richmond experiment, which will probably have to be disclosed, and the closing down of the experiment, are bound to have an adverse effect on the development of the new industry, and it is therefore desirable to consider to what extent it is practicable to counteract this.Last year an Association was formed of all the main concerns interested in low temperature carbonisation processes, and I have on two or three occasions met representatives of the Association.    I welcome the formation of this Association as I feel that both on the research side and on the side of commercial develop ment great advantages are bound to accrue in dealing with the various problems which are bound to arise.    It is also preferable,  in connection with any assistance which the Government should wish to render, that it should deal with the Association rather than with individual concerns.In its representations to me the Association was at first inclined to suggest that nothing short of substantial financial assistance would be of any use to the new industry, but having made it clear to the Association that the question of financial assistance could not, under the present policy of the Government be considered, the Association accepted the position that there were other directions in which the Government could help.In order to indicate the present ctage of development it may be mentioned that the first of the commercial plants nov in operation was brought into use in -1927 and has been worked continually since that date.    A few other commercial sized plants in addition to that at Richmond have been put up in the interval,  and a month or two ago the South Metropolitan Gas Company began operations at Greenwich with a plant designed for a throughput of ?F50 tons a day.
So far however as information is available go the Department only one comparatively small low temperature carbonisation company has paid a dividend on Its ordinary share capital, and one of the main reasons for this unsatisfactory result is said to be the very large fall in the value of by-products, particularly the tar oils, which has taken place during the last few years *.In consultation with the   Department of Scientific and Industrial Research I have given careful consideration as to  the directions in which the Government can best render assistanceoFor a number of years considerable sums have been expended by the Government on research work carried out at the Fuel Research Station.    Much of the money has been spent on comparatively small scale experimental works    Some work of this character will have to go on for many years, as new problems are constantly arising, and it is essential that the laboratory work should continue.I am however of opinion, and the Department.of Scientific and Industrial Research agree with me,  that the time has come to undertake some further research work on low temperature carbonisation on a larger scale.As already pointed out,  the market for tar oils has fallen and is still falling;,    Any large development of low temperature carbonisation would still further reduce prices, and with our present knowledge of low temperature tar, this material would   not be an asset of any substantial value to  the process,  it might become a liability.    It is therefore of the first importance to find methods of treatment that will enhance the value of this important by-product. Laboratory scale experiments at the  Station have indicated very promising ways of dealing with low temperature tars.    It is proposed to develop these to a small commercial scalee    For this purpose a considerable quantity of tar oil of known origin prepared under varying conditions from various coals is required.It is proposed that in the main the tar oil shall be produced at the Scation from a setting of four retorts capable of dealing with
35 to SO tons of ooal a day.    The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research consider that additional research work on retorts is necessary and the development of tb.2 work on the lines proposed will enable this to be carried out.    It was pointed out in the Cabinet memorandum on the Richmond experiment, to which reference has already been made, that considerable trouble was experienced with the metal retorts.    Other operators have had similar difficulty in obtaining a suitable metal.    Recently the Fuel Research Station has been experimenting with a brick retort and the results so far obtained have been satisfactory.    If successful this new type of retort will be cheaper to erect; have a longer life, and give a greater throughput than the metal retorts previously tried, all of which are factors of considerable importance to the economic development of the process.On the treatment of the tar oils the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research suggest the development of the laboratory scale experiments to a small commercial scale. The first step is to erect intermediate scale plants to try out on the larger scale the processes evolved in the laboratory. A suitable scale is one dealing with some 2 - T tons of tar oil a day.    It is proposed that more than one process should be tried out, and these experiments will show which,  if any, are worth trying on a commercial scale unit, and give the data essential   .. for the design of such a unit.Perhaps the most promising fie-ld for the utilisation of the tar is the production of motor spirit and diesel oils. &quot;Whichever method of treatment is used will necessitate the provision of some distilling and refining plant.The methods of converting the Low Temperature Carbonisation by-products into motor spirit include:-
(1) &quot;Hydrogenation&quot;  - treatment with hydrogen in the presence of catalysts at high pressures.(2) &quot;Cracking&quot; with or without catalysts and hydrogen at atmospheric,  or comparatively low, pressures.(3) The treatment of tar vapours from the reports before condensation.These methods will apply to both high and low temperature tars, and it is considered that both types should be covered by the experiments.Some of the plants required for the above will also be available, if necessary, for experiments on the hydrogenation of coal.A rough estimate of the capital cost of carrying out these experiments has been prepared by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and amounts to  33,.500.    Much of the plant is standard and could be put in hand at once but it is unlikely that more than, say,  17,000 would be spent during the financial year 1931/32, assuming approval were given before April 30th.The running cost would involve an increase In salaries and wages of about  0,000 per annum when the plant was working,, together with a further sum of  o,,000 for materials, etc. This excludes the cost of coal which,  it is considered, would be largely paid for by the sale of products..   During 1931 the extra expenditure on wages etc.,, mainly for the erection of the plant, would not exceed  2,500.The proposals made by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have.been examined by the Advisory Council to that-Department, a body on which many eminent scientists sit, and have been approved, by it..
fi 0 oIt will also be remembered that in the debate which took&quot;place in the House of Commons on the 11th March on the navy estimates, the Civil Lord of the Admiralty,  speaking on behalfof the Government accepted an amendment to the motion before theHouse to the following effect:&quot;That in the opinion of this House,  it is desirable for strategic and economic reasons and to help in providing employment that energetic steps be taken to encourage the use of oil fuel for the Royal Navy from our own coal.&quot;During the course of his speech the Civil Lord referred to the fact that the Admiralty had tested several&apos; samples of oil supplied by low temperature carbonisation concerns and had found some of them reasonably satisfactory.      The results of the tests made by the Admiralty and others which have been carried out by the Air Ministry indicate however that certain defects were met with in the oils which will have to be remedied before they can be regarded as entirely suitable by the Service Departments.     It will be possible in the further experimental work which it is now proposed should be carried out at the Fuel Research Station to deal with all these aspects of the problem.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research has also indicated that if the Low Temperature Distillers&apos; association which [/ is understood to be willing to carry out some research work on tar oils, will submit a scheme of research to that Department,  it may be possible to make a grant on the usual conditions now applicable to co-operative industrial research associations. Negotiations with a similar object,for high temperature tar are also in progress with the British Road Tar Association.      I am in agreement with these proposals and I am informed that the money to give effect to them can be found from funds already available to the Department.Reference has already been made to the fact that the new plant to be erected under these proposals can also be utilised if necessary for experiments on the hydrogenation of coal.
;i. considerable amount of work on this subject is being carried out by Imperial Chemical Industries Limited and certain proposals are under consideration involving Government co-operation in the commercial development of the hydrogenation of coal process.      In view of the large sums of public money which may be involved there is a further reason in my view for proceeding with the new work at the Fuel Research Station so that a check may be made -of. proposals which from time to time may be submitted to the Government.But in any event I consider that the carrying out of this extended programme of research at the Fuel Research Station will afford the best kind of assistance which the Government can provide at this stage for helping the development of these processes.    The information will be available to those who have a bona fide interest in low temperature and other processes to the general benefit of the community*On the question of educating the public as to the desirability on national grounds of using smokeless fuel I consider that the Government must set an example by expressing its willingness to use smokeless fuel in Government Institutions and I make the following proposalsIt is true that there is no great difficulty in disposing of the present output of low temperature fuel. Generally speaking, a good price is secured for it for domestic purposes, particularly during the winter months.     But there is some difficulty in disposing of the output during the summer months,  and in consequence of this it is the practice partially to close the plant during the summer.      This results in the wording costs being-increased.     What is needed is steady working throughout the year, and it is suggested that the Government might help in this direction by undertaking to use low temperature fuel in Government Offices and Institutions.      This aspect of the question has been discussed with the Departments which purchase fuel, and while it may be that owing to the relatively high price charged for the fuel it may be
difficult -for- Government-Departments to buy any considerable&quot;&apos; quantity in displacement of coal, except by incurring additional expense, it should be possible for those Departments which have storage facilities to secure supplies during the summer months at lower   prices, and thus assist in the regular working of low temperature carbonisation plants.      The saving in costs which would result from such regular working would lead to an improvement in the commercial results and thus assist companies in their efforts to raise additional capital for expansion.      It might also be possible to induce local authorities in large centres to use low temperature fuel in their Offices and Institutions.     The Ministry of Health have been consulted, and they have expressed their willingness to consider the possibility of approaching local authorities on this question,I am of opinion therefore that an announcement of the Governments interest in this question and an expression of their willingness to help cn the lines indicated would be of great advantage to the industry, and I therefore suggest that, when announcing the Government1s proposals which are dealt with in this memorandum, I should be authorised to make a statement to the effect that low temperature fuel will be burned in Government Offices and Institutions in this country wherever it can be obtained at a price comparable, value for value, with the price of coal,  and that the Minister of Health will endeavour to persuade local authorities in large centres to help on the same lines.,There is one other matter connected with the development of these processes on which I propose to take action.      This relates to the collection of information.      Little reliable information is available of the operations of these processes and I propose to collect statistical information annually in future as I think it is desirable that some means of measuring their development should be available,,
Use of Pulverised Fuel.The question of pulverised coal is one which needs further attention even though it may not in the present state of scientific knowledge fulfil the prophecies of its enthusiastic supporters who see in it the salvation of the mining industry.There are very few large power or heat -producing plants in this country running on oil, although there is a growing tendency to use oil fuel in large hotels and other big buildings where central heating plants are installed.      In the main there-fore the extended use of pulverised coal in shore plants will only mean a more economical method of producing heat and power from coal.     As already pointed out in the early part of this memorandum, the immediate effect of this is to reduce the amount of coal required to produce the same amount of heat and so to prove a temporary disadvantage to the mining industry, although ultimately benefits may accrue from a consequential increase in demand due to the lowering of fuel costs.A number of large power stations are to-day successfully using pulverised coal for steam raising purposes and there is little doubt that its use will gradually extend.For the purpose of pulverising the coal to the requisite degree of fineness it is necessary to use somewhat expensive pulverising plant and as there are difficulties in storing or transporting the fuel after pulverisation the pulverising machinery must under present conditions be installed at or near the point of consumption.      There is no great difficulty in arranging this at large plants but until the difficulties of storing and transport have heen overcome it is not likely to prove practicable to extend the use of pulverised fuel at small works..The field which probably offers the greatest chance of direct benefit to the coal mining industry from the use of
pulverised fuel is its use for bunker purposes on board ship, where there are possibilities of its displacing oil or at all events holding up the change over to oil fuel.    It is therefore in this direction that any assistance which the Government cm give will best be expended,    Many experiments have been made by Shipping Companies and a number are still being carried out.    Considerable success is claimed by some but in nearly every case difficulties have occurred.It is the case with nearly every new development that extravagant claims are made by inventors and those who seek to exploit new processes and rarely do these claims prove to be justified.    The use of pulverised fuel on ships cannot claim to be one of the exceptions.    Yet it is a fact that a few important shipping companies are persisting in their experiments and are willing to use pulverised coal fuel in preference to oil if it can be done on an economic basis.At present there are difficulties with systems of pulverisation and with methods of combustion and the latter is particularly important from a shipping point of view.    The usual practice, where pulverised fuel is used for steam raising on land, is to use a very large combustion space.    It would appear to be possible to reduce this space and for use at sea such reduction is essential.Luring the past year the Fuel Research Station has been giving some attention to this problem and experiments on burners,  embodying some new ideas,&quot; are being carried out at the Station.It has also been suggested that there might be a greater chance of success for pulverised coal used on ships having water tube boilers,  and this view is supported by the Engineer in Chief of the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade.
M O f*jHitherto water tube boilers have not been widely adopted in the Mercantile Marine.      They are more expensive to instal and are more difficult to work than the cylindrical type of boiler more generally used.      There is however a growing tendency to instal them in passenger liners.      The great problem is to obtain absolute purity of feed water without which these boilers cannot be run with either safety or economy.      Oil fuel is equally suitable for use with such boilers but if it can be demonstrated that pulverised fuel is more economical to burn than oil it may render possible a wider use in the Mercantile Marine of water tube boilers fired by pulverised fuel.Investigation into this aspect of the problem is deserving of Government support as there is in the British K   ;cantlle Marine a considerable block of tonnage designed to burn either oil or coal which would be likely to adopt.coal burning if pulverised fuel could be proved to be cheaper than oil.      This, no doubt, would be followed by a gradual reversion from oil firing to coal firing.      The Report of the Treatment of Coal Committee of the Oil Board, presided over by   the Civil Lord of the Admiralty, -Cabinet Paper T.C.   (O.B.)  SI - merely recommended that the Mercantile Marine Department should keep the position regarding pulverised fuel under review, but I suggest that more active steps might be taken in regard to it and that I might be given authority to endeavour to secure the carrying out under sea-going conditions of a thorough test of various systems of pulverised fuel on different ships under both cylindrical and water tube boilers and the comparison of the costs of running these ships &quot;with others using ordinary coal, whether hand fired or with mechanical stokers^      Should it appear clear that some Government assistance is necessary to secure the carrying out of such tests on a proper basis,  proposals will be submitted to the Treasury for consideration,&quot;-i4-   : .   -
A 9 9 -&apos;- U (jThe Mercantile &quot;Marine Department have been consulted and do not raise any objection to this proposal.Hydrogenation.Passing reference has been made to this question, but as the subjoct is being dealt with by a separate Cabinet Sub-Committee, with which my Department is connected,  I feel it unnecessary to deal further with this subject in this memorandum.Coke Oven Research.To complete the present review of the position I desire to mention a scheme for full scale research into coke ovens which has been advocated for many years, hos been worked out in some detail by the Fuel Research Board and is endorsed by the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.    The proposal has also been approved in principle by the Lord President of the Council, but has not yet been submitted to the Treasury for consideration,  and steps are now being taken to prepare the necessary plans and d etailed estimates of expenditure.    The provisional  estimate of the capital cost is  50,000.This scheme was approved by the Advisory Council before I asked the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to consider the proposals for additional work on low temperature carbonisation outlined above.    The proposal is an important one which aims at a study of coke oven practice on a large scale and seeks to enlarge the sources of supply of coking coals.    Unless the range of supply can be extended there is real reason to anticipate within a measurable period of time a shortage of coking coal.&apos;  This scheme is likely therefore to prove of considerable value to the iron and steel industry and to the coal industry and I feel bound to mention it now,
I am firmly of the opinion that,  even in the present state of financial stringency, the Government is fully justified in providing adequately for research v/ork,      Other important industrial countries spend much larger sums on research work than is the case with this country.A short time ago I received on behalf of the Government a deputation from the Trades Union Congress and the Miners&apos; Federation which sought to impress upon the Government the need for a more active policy in regard to the question of the treatment and.utilisation of coal,  and there can be no doubt that any action which the Government may take in regard to this matter will be fully supported by the Labour Movement. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS. Low Temperature Carbonisation.(a) Direct financial assistance by the Government not to be given to the development of these processes except in so far as it may be practicable to taice advantage of the provisions of the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act,  1929.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research accept the view that the work on low temperature carbonisation,  outlined in this memorandum,  is more urgent than that on coke oven research.      There are limitations to the amount of new work which can be undertaken at once by the Fuel Research Station and therefore it is not suggested that any money should he provided during the financial year 1931-32 for the coke oven scheme.    When the detailed estimates have been prepared and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research considers it practicable to begin the work definite proposals will be submitted by the Departments for Treasury consideration.

P F p N D I X.n-pAnm By TPS ADVISORY COUNCIL OH A PROPOSAL TO -cT-FD LOr ^--:P21ATUR,3 CARBONISATION WORK AT THE&apos;Prs^ARCK STATION &quot;WITH SPECIAL EIF3EENC il TO TH&quot;5 &apos;uTILI3A ii ON OF TKC TAR PRODUCED AT LOW AND ALSO AT EIGH TELP2PATURES.1.     The Advisory Council have considered the proposal, set out in the attached statement, to extend low temperature carbonisation work at tho Fuel Research Station with special reference to utilisation of the tars produced, including also investigation of tars produced by the high temperature carbon-i sat ion of coal.      The Council understood the proposal to involve a capital outlay of about  53,0-0 and a maintenance charge of about  8,000 per annum.2.      It was noted that the proposal    arose out of the termination of the &quot;Richmond, experiment&quot; on low temperature carbonisation,  conducted through the Gas Light and Coke Company under a guarantee from the Government.      The Company had  decided not to exercise the option given to them of acquiring the plant at the  end of the exporiernants ,  and negotiations between the hires Department,  the Government Department responsible ,and the Gas Light and  Coke  Company, undertaken with a view to arrange-msnts for the  continuation of the experiments for, say,  three to five years, but under kines Department control, had not led to a successful result.     The i-..ines Department were anxious, however, that the technical possibilities of the low  temperature carbonisation process should be further explored in all its aspects, with particular reference to the possibility of enhancing the value  of the by-products, and had  come to the conclusion that the best course would be to instal a plant at the Fuel-Research Station with a view to a complete range of experiments on a small commercial scale.      with this in mind the attached scheme had bean prepared by the   director
of FuoJ^JR^seaj?t^-Jlar -ccoosi^iear^iiion. -   The scheme is based on the erection of four brick retorts, and the installation of the necessary auxiliary plant - including plant for the study of the different methods of treating the tar,  i,e,, hydrogenation, cracking, or by treatment before condensation (the Prudhomme process).3.      The scheme has been discussed at length by tho Council on two separate occasions.      During these dis-eussions they have had the assistance of the Chairman of the Fuel Research Board, the Director of Fuel Research, and officers of the Mines Department.4e      One of the objects of the scheme is to explore the possibility of utilising the tar for the production of oil fuel and motor spirit.     The dependence of the Navy on imported oil fuel and the danger to which this country might, for that reason, be exposed in an emergency, is, in itself, a strong argument in favour of some suoh scheme of work. Again, the Council regard it as being of the highest Import-ance that every possible step should be taken to obtain full scientific information about the utilisation of our coal resources and as will be seen later, the soheme is very attractive from that point of view.     There was, therefore, little doubt about the desirability of work in the general direction contemplated,  and the lengthy consideration which the Council gave to the scheme was mainly directed to exploring the necessity for work on the large scale proposed, because they wished to satisfy themselves that the large
v-^penditure involved was necessary in order to obtain the information required and that full value would be extracted from any funds applied in the way proposed^5.      To turn to the discussion of the scheme itself in its broad details,  it has already been noted that it is based on the erection of four brick retorts.      Hitherto the low temperature carbonisation of coal has been carried out in cast-iron retorts.      Brick retorts have not been considered practicable for that purpose on account of the difficulty of heating them up and working them without cracking.    Such cracks, formed during the heating of brick retorts for high temperature carbonisation are not nearly so serious in their effect as in the case of low temperature carbonisation.    This difficulty has not as yet, however, manifested itself in the case of the one brick retort erected at the Fuel Research Station, and which has now been in -operation for about three months,    It is, however, desirable to see whether this success can be continued.    Otherwise the retort seems promising.    &quot;&apos;ith It,  it has been found possible considerably to increase the throughput of coal per day,   (a maximum throughput of about eight tons per day has been attained^  as against two tons a day in the  &quot;Richmond experiment&quot;) and this in practice would mean a reduction of capital outlay on plant and on labour costs.      The products obtained also are satisfactory.      forking: at a temperature of 680oC,  the coke produced appears to be harder than that previously obtained from low temperature carbonisation processes,  and It does not burn av;ay quite so readily.      It has been shown also that the tars can be successfully  &quot;hydrogenated&quot;.    Another advantage
of these brick retorts is that they make it possible to study the carbonisation of ccal throughout the range of temperature intermediate between that of low temperature carbonisation asordinarily understood (i.e.  about S00oG) and that o^ high, o  ,temperature carbonisation (1,000 to 1,200 C).      Thecarbonisation of coal throughout this ran0e of temperature hasalready been explored,  in point cf fact at the Fuel ResearchStation, but only in 2 cwt.  batches, and a proposal to extend this work by carrying out experiments throughout the range on.a large  scale is one which is likely.to lead to information ofgreat value from the soientific point of view.      It has becomacommon to draw a somewhat artificial distinction between thethree different methods of carbonisin0 coal,  i. e. low temperaturecarbonisation, high temperature carbonisation, and carbonisationfor the production ox metallurgical coke.    Prom the scientificPoint of view, however,  it is undesirable to. observe any lineof demarcation,  since all three are but different aspects ofthe one general problem of coal carbonisation, and it isimportant that the scientific investigation of that problem should not be restricted to the somewhat narrow grooves connotedby the terms mentioned.      An interesting fact was brought out during the discussion which, serves to reinforce this considerationLow temperature carbonisation was, of course, undertaken bythe Fuel Research Board with a view to the production of a free-burning and smokeless domestic fuel.      It was thought,when the work was initiated,  that the quality of &quot;fre e-burning;&apos;was dependent upon there being left in the coal a oertainquantity of the volatile constituents,  and for that purpose itwas considered that the oarbonisation mast necessarily beoarried out at a low temperature.      iviore recent work, how over,
has shown that the property of &quot;free-&quot;burning&quot; is not ^91?dependent on volatile content but on a property of the coke described as &quot;reactivity&quot;.    The search for a free kwning domestic fuel,  therefore,  is no longer limited, as regards temperature of carbonisation, to the extent hitherto supposed,6,    while the Council therefore were convinced of the desirability of this range of carbonisation experiments and of the necessity for large scale work,   (since the conditions in a large scale retort cannot be simulated on a small scale), they were inclined to be&quot;, somewhat sceptical of the&apos;necessity for as many as four new retorts,  though clear that two were essential.      They welcomed,  therefore, an alternative proposal made by the Director of Fuel Research during the course of the discussion.      The Director of Fuel Research suggested that instead of two of the four brick retorts proposed,  there should be erected two retorts of a type described as &quot;Intermittent Vertical&quot; retorts.      He pointed, out that one advantage of this alternative type would be that they would enable some of the problems associated with the production of metallurgical&apos; coke to be studied.7.      To consider next theflquestion of the treatment of the by-products,  i-e.,  the treatment of the tar by hydrogenation or by cracking,  or alternatively,- its treatment before condensation (the Prudhbmme process),  the Council were specially concerned to satisfy themselves that in these directions full advantage would be taken of the possibilities of small scale experiment,  before embarking on larger scale work.    They were assured that,  in point of fact,  the plan of work in this direction would be one of progressive development from exhaustive small scale trials,  followed by larger scale work on the more promising processes evolved.
The Director of Fuel Research, emphasised that already the tar hydrogenation process had been thoroughly explored on a small scale,  and that it had been found possible to produce 15 gallons of motor spirit       treating 2C gallons of tar.     Ho further XorogresE was possible in this direction except &quot;by seeing whether this very satisfactory result could be repeated on a larger scale.      On the questions of &quot;cracking&quot; and the treatment of tar before condensation, the Fuel Research Station, he explained, was not yet ready to embark on larger scale work, but large scale work in these directions must necessarily be envisaged in any complete scheme of investigation.8.    After detailed consideration in this way,  therefore, the Council were satisfied that expenditure of the order proposed in the general directions indicated could well be justified in view of the yield of scientific information which might be expected, and they were all the more clear in expressing this opinion after having satisfied themselves that no expensive large scale work would be undertaken except after full study, wherever practicable,  by small scale experiment. Obviously,  it is not possible at the moment clearly to envisage how the work is likely to develop, and it would be necessary to allow the Fuel Research Board a certain measure of liberty, subject to financial limitations,  in modifying the scheme according as the work proceeds.9-    In expressing their approval of the scheme, however,, the Council were concerned lest their action should lead to any over-confident hopes as to its economic possibilities.    No attempt was made by the Council to examine the scheme from the economic point of view, and they felt that it should be clearly understood that their action in agreeing to it must not be taken to imply that they were of opinion that the processes with, which
A noa 6the new investigations would be concerned could be carried out on an economic basis under existing conditions.    Their approval of the scheme was based essentially on the need for more complete scientific information on the utilisation of coal and on the necessity of finding out methods of producing oil fuel and motor spirit from coal irrespective of whether or not the processes were likely to be economic under ordinary conditions. 10.      To summarise,  therefore,  the Council(a) agreed that as the study of the carbonisation of coal, and the treatment of the by-products, under the widest possible range of conditions is essential in the national interest in order to obtain the scientific information required for determining the best ways of utilising our coal resources, the general scheme submitted could be fully approved from the scientific point of view as being in effect a proposal to accelerate the Department&apos;s programme of work in that field on lines which are in consonance with existing scientific policy, proper insistence being laid on the necessity for exhaustive study by small scale experiments, wherever practicable, before large scale work was undertaken;(b) agreed that,  if the Government were disposed to make available the necessary funds (capital outlay about  23tOOO; anc* maintenance expenditure about  8,000 per annum),  such funds could be applied in the general directions indicated with every prospect of securing an adequate return by additions to scientific&apos;knowledge of the treatment of coal, which might
in turn lead to developments of importance to this country with reference,  in particular,  to the production from coal of oil fuel and motor-spirit ;decided to make it clear that their action in expressing agreement with the proposals must not be taken to imply that they were of opinion that the processes with which the newinvestigations would be concerned could becarried out on an economic basis under existing conditions.RUTKMOTORD. 28,3.31,
