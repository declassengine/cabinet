Salter during his stay in China will be the confidential adviser of the Chinese Government it may embarrass him to be asked by His Majesty&apos;s Government at that moment for his views on such questions as foreign loans to China.    He may feel bound to tell the Chinese Government frankly that His Majesty1s Government have asked for his views and this may make the Chinese Government indisposed to consult him as freely as they otherwise might..    The Foreign Office suggest therefore that Sir M, Lampsoh might merely be instructed to show Sir A. Salter in confidence a copy of the Committee^ Report, but that nothing further should be said to Sir A. Salter until after he has left    China.    The bare communication suggested would not doubt serve to direct his thoughtstowards the problem.(Itld.) A. H.Foreign Office,3.^.1. , February 21st. 1931.
