S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERMffiNT)**&apos; t., CABINET. Copy No____/. . ..2(yi).&apos;REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MAIN LINE RAILWAYELECTRIFICATION.Memorandum by The Minister ef Transport.In September 1929, with the approval of the Prime Minister. I appointed a Committee to examine the economic and ether aspects of the electrification of the railway systems in Great Britain, with particular reference to main line working, and to report their conclusions.The Committee consisted of Lord Weir, Sir Ralph Wedgwood and Sir William McLintock and they have just presented their Report which takes the form of a series of carefully considered findings and conclusions.These are clearly summarised in the Report and to that summary, of which I annex a copy, I invite the attention of my colleagues,    (See Appendix).      The reference did not instruct the Committee to make any definite recommendations and, as they point out in their concluding paragraph, any programme of wholesale electrification requires the most careful censideration and any decision involves national, financial and possibly ultimate political considerations and implications which they do not feel it any part ef their present duty to discuss.      The object of the Committee has therefore been to make olear the essential economic factors involved in the problem.It is obvious that the report will require exhaustive examination and I shall desire to consult fully with the Electricity Commissioners and the Central Electricity Board, as well as with the Railway Companies themselves.      I do not at this stage wish to do more  than seek the authority of my colleagues to publish the Report, which is of the utmost value,  so  that it may be available for consideration to all concerned and in particular to send it to the Railway Companies with a request that they will submit their observations a^ p reasonably early date.
I may, however,  draw attention briefly to a few of tsjha ty more important and interesting features of the Report.The existence of the electricity grid and the consequent low-price and availability of electrical energy constitutes a new and favourable factor for railway electrification,      The problem must be determined on the  conditions prevailing in this country,  and the absence of water power is not a handicap. Foreign experience in any case was not regarded by the Committee as affording any conclusive guide or assistance to    them,      since the reasons which have led to  the adoption of electrical haulage abroad are mainly of a special character,  including the desire to avoid importation of coal and to meet particular operating-difficulties such as those connected with steep gradients and long tunnels.The Committee take note of the difficulties with which British railway transport is  at present confronted in the growth of road competition and the long depression in the basic industries, but have approached the question remitted to them &quot;constructively as one vitally affecting an industry which is itself vital to  the future progress of British enterprise and production&quot;0In addition to  surveying the general considerations which arose in connection with their problem,  the Committee  caused a careful technical investigation to be made as to the financial results of the electrification of two typical and heavily trafficked sections of main line  - one on the London Lidland and bcottish Railway between Crewe and Carlisle and the other on the London and North Eastern Railway corresponding with the Oold Great Northern system.These reports,   together with other investigations and estimates,  enabled the Committee to arrive at the approximate financial results of a complete scheme of electrification and convinced them that in order to esecure the fullest economic
z 9 P QP U U Oadvantage&quot; any scheme adopted should &quot;be a comprehensive jnee Assuming that such a scheme were carried out over a period of from 15 to 20 years,  the new capital involved on the part of the railways would he approximately  2^1 million and on a conservative basis and on the assumption of existing traffic the  return estimated through various economies in expenditure as compared with the cost of steam working would represent about 7 per cent.The Committee remark that this return would give a surplus of approximately 2f. after meeting interest charges on the new capital involved and while in their view this would in itself be too narrow a margin for the risks and contingencies involved, they paint out that it takes account only of direct economies and ignores a number of substantial advantages including speed, comfort, auoE.t.ty and improved service,  the value of which cannot be expressed in money,,      Moreover the calculation is made on existing traffic, but improved service and general development should   lead to increase of traffic and the possible financial benefits are likely to be substantial.      In an Appendix the Committee explain in detail the fact that any increase of traffic is likely to be more profitable in the case of electrical operation than in the case t-f steam haulage.      In one direction, the Committee have attempted a financial assessment, viz,   that on a broad estimate they anticipate that special schemes for intensifying suburban working would yield an additional return of on an additional capital expenditure of about  if 5 million.In addition to the expenditure on the railway companies&apos; systems,  there would be a further expenditure by the Central Electricity Board or authorised undertakers,  amounting to about  80 million,  in excess of their existing programmes, on which the Board and the undertakers would earn their normal revenue in the shape of payment by the Railway Companies for current supplied -
9* U f]i y ij- ^ -The total capital expenditure involved in the scheme would thus he in the neighbourhood of  JLO million,  apart from a further possible expenditure of  If 5 million in intensifying suburban servicesc      As Lord V/eir points out,  the magnitude of such an operation would be unique in the history of world enterprise and the  figures alone suffice to shew the need for careful study of all the material and implications contained in the Report,  including the consequences of almost complete dependence for rail transport on centralised sources of electrical supply.Apart from the advantages to rail transport;     a factor of great importance is the effect of the increased load with its high load factor,  on the national system and tho consequent favourable re-action on the cost of electrical energy produced for all purposes.      The additional network of transmission lines required should also do much to accelerate rural electrification.The Committee have carefully considered&apos; the effects of a programme of wholesale electrification on the railway staff, on the national coal output and on industry.      As regards the staff,  the  change-over from steam to electric traction will not materially affect the conditions of railway employees other than those in the locomotive grades and the Committee anticipate that the adverse effect of the change,  even in those grades, will be limited and temporary,,      Any reduction in staff would bo mitigate.&apos; by the duration of tho programme and the probable increase in train mileage.      This matter, however,  is one which as they recognise v/ould require close examination if it should be decided to proceed with tho scheme,.As  regards coal,   there will be a not decrease in consumption of about 9% million tons,  or about pA 8   of the national output,
9 r; fthut the programme should in itself hope to stimulate industry and oor.avjn.ption.As regards industry, with the exception of raw copper,   substantially all the expenditure would he distributed in this country and,  on the commonlyaccepted basis that  1 million provides work for one year for 4, ,000) mo :o, the Committee estimate the volume of employment  at 31000 man per annum over a period of 20 years0In conclusion, the Committes express without hesitati.cn the view&apos; that the mere magnitude of the sum. involved should he no  deterrent to the most &apos; careful and earnest consideration of a comprehensive programme on its economic and social merits.    In this view I concur,I propose therefore to consult as soon as may be with the Central Electricity Board; the Electricity Commissioners and the Railway Companies in the matter, and in due course to submit my conclusions to the Cabinet.I ask for authority meanwhile to publish the report for which we are greatly indebted to Lord Weir and his colleagues.(Intld.)

9 n 4u I JLAPPENDIX.Siumnary and Conclusions.    .,(,P:arVlll^of,Report)w&quot;e are not asked in our terms of reference to embody in our Report any definite recommendations, but,  as a final result of the foregoing, we have cone to certain unanimous conclusions of major importance which we now summarise,(i)      The  existence of the national s cherne of generation of electrical energy and the consequent low price and availability of such energy constitute a new and favourable factor, in the economics of further railway electrification in Great &quot;Britain,(ii)     An efficient aid progressive railway system is &quot;and will continue to be a matter of vital importance to the Nation,(iii)      In view of the competition of road transport and  the existing industrial and agricultural depression,  it is essential that the railways should examine new methods of reducing the costs of railway transportation.(iv)      Comprehensive electrification of nain line railways has not taken place in any foreign country except Switzerland, but generally speaking railway electrification is making steady progress in many parts of the world,(v)      The main reasons which have led to  the adoption of electric haulage  in foreign countries,  broadly speaking, do not apply in this country,  and they have not offered any conclusive guide or assistance in our investigations.(vi)      British railway electrification up to now has been confined to suburban lines,  and the results,  economic and other-wise, have been favourable.(vii) The economic success of British suburban electrification is due to the substantial increase in revenue following on the much improved service which an electrified railway can provide,(viii)      Suburban electrification provides no sound comparison of actual operating costs of steam and electric haulage, but it does present certain prim?, facie considerations in favour of electric haulage for main lines.(ix)       The increased load on the national system which electrical -fication cf&apos; the railways lgould contribute,   together with its high load factor, would react most favourably on the cost of electrical energy produced for all purposes,  while the additional transmission network required, for railway electrification would do much to accelerate rural electrification throughout the country.(x)        In&apos; the event of si scheme of main line electrification being adopted,   the Central Electricity Board should be  given statutory power to supply electrical energy direct to the railways for electrification schemes.      In addition to this railway companies should be entitled to utilise,  for purely railway purposes,  at any? point in their systems,  supplies of electrical energy obtained from the Board or any other authorised undertakers.
0 r;s *Ti(xi)     In any coTEprelienalve scheme of railway electrif ica-ti on the Central. Electricity Board should provide the tranjpjbrission lines, build and equip the sub-stations, and. supply the energy at the Direct Current bus bars of &quot;the sub-station, but the operation and control of&quot; the sub-stations should be in the hands of the railway companies.(xli)      In regard to the most suitable system of electrification, the report and recommendations of the Pringle Committee should be followed.(xiii)     Improvements in t he fuel economy of steam tractors will take place, but such economy is likely to be counterbalanced by higher capital costs and maintenance charges,(xiv)     The most promising alternative to steam haulage,  other than electrification,  rests in the development of the oil engine m. th electrical transmission to&apos; the driving wheels, but experience of this  system is still limited,  and it would appear that era well-loaded lines this system must always be less economical than electrificationa(xv)     In considering alternatives to the steam locomotive preference should be given to systems using coal rather than oil as being in the national interesto(xvi)     Apart from the direct financial economies of electrifi-cation as disclosed in comparative costs of operation, electrificatior. offers important indirect- advantages associated with speed,   comfort, amenity, improved service,   and increase of capacity.(xvii)     Leaving aside the financial aspects of the matter?  the disadvantages of eleotrification relate almost entirely to the dependence of the system on centx^nationalised sources of electrical energy.(xviii)      Tho main items of haulage cost which can be materially reduced&quot;by electrification are locomotive wages and locomotive repairSc(xix)     Unless special conditions obtain,  the electrification of small sections of a main line railway system is unlikely to be&apos; economically&apos; justified on account of the costs of dual working,  and the consequent inability to take  the fullest advantage of the new capital expended on fixed equipment or haula-ge unitsa
(xxQ To secure the ;pulle,co economic advantage of Tialligy&apos; c^^OteLSoation til this country, any scheme adopted should he a comprehensive one preferably comprising all the non-electrified lines, less such branch lines as detailed examination may show to be more econoiiii-cally operated by independent ha&amp;lage units either steam or oil electric,(xxi) Assuming that such a scheme is carried out on a comprehensive programme over a period from fifteen to twenty yearss    on a conservative basis and on the assumption of existing traffic , the new capital involved cir the partof the railways would be approximately  261^000,000, and -the return on this through tho various economies would represent about seven per cent.(xxii) Apart from the direct return due to these economies other substantial advantages could be realised, the most important being increased revenue from suburban and inter-suburban traffic.      On a broad estimate we anticipate that schemes of intensifying suburban working would yield an additional revenue of  5S8505000 representing a return of thirteen per cent on uhe additional capital expenditure of  45,000,000 which would be involved.(xxiii) The figure of estimated capitalexpenditure is likely to be reduced due to nen-eloctrifieaiion of lightly loaded lines3 redundant lines and sidings, and reductionin capital cost of tractors, etc. , due to largo scale production and continuous manufacturing programme.      On the other hand some allowance must be made for the electr-ifiaa&amp;lon of private sidings and private branch railways worked over by the railway companies in the process of the transfer of traffic.(xxlv)  In addition to the expenditure under-this programme s there will be a further expenditure b3r the Central Electricity Board and authorised Undertakers of approximately  80,OCOS000 in excess of existing programmes, on which these bodies would earn their normal revenue.(xxv) The change over from steam to electric traction will not xiaterially affect the conditions of railway employees other than those in the locomotive grades *      Even in the:case of these grades we anticipate the adverse affect of the change will be of a limited and temporary character owing to the duration of the programme together with the probable increase in suburban and other train mileage.,      The matter , however is one which should, be more closely examined if it  -should be decided to proceed with this . scheme.(xxvi) Apart from considerations of finance and railway administration? a comprehensive programme such as we have indicated. If it is to be undertaken, should preferably be carried out as a united co-operative scheme by the railway companies, in order to obtain the beat results from the technical, construction and supply standpoint.(xxvii) Prom the general point of view of technical development and international competition the value of sucha programme of domestic electrification would be most substantial to our national electric manufacturing industry-(ill)
The preceding are the conclusions we have formed, and we would bring our report to an end with one general observation..      The existing railway system is a vital part of the equipment of our country and its efficiency and economy affect the lives of practically every irfhabitant, our industry and our agriculture.     A definite decision to alter the haulage system on a comprehensive programme, which in our view is the only method of achieving complete success, would involve a commitment of capital expenditure by the railways of about  261 millions, and of about  80 millions by the Central Electricity Board and other authori-tiesy apart from the extra expenditure necessary in order to realise an intensive suburban development.     The magnitude-tude of this would be unique in the history of world enterprise.On the other hands we feel bound to point out that without any predetermined long term programme, our national expenditure on the construction^ improvement and maintenance of roads in the last ten years had probably amounted to the colossal sum of  500 millions and is now proceeding at the rate of over  60 millions per annum.      Road haulage is in direct competition with the Railways for a large amount of traffic but.s unlike the railway system, there exists for the roads no balance sheet or computation of profit and loss.      There is no definite economic test   of financial soundness,,     With this reflection in mind, we have no hesitation in concluding that the mere magnitude of -the&quot;:suLm involved in complete electrification of our railwaysy^;:. should be no deterrent in itself to the most careful t-nd earnest consideration of such a programme on its econnie and social merits.      The decision involves national financial and possibly ultimate political considerations and impli-cationa which we do not feel it is any part of our. present -duty to   discuss5 but ye trust that towards the considera-tion of the problem which will no doubt take place in the minds of those concerned;, tho railwajrs. the Government, and the country5 we have at least made clear the essential economic factors.
