HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1931.SECRET.Copy No.    t)CP. 92 (31).CABINET.THE USE OF BRITISH HONDURAS AS A BASE FOR THE ILLICIT LIQUOR TRADE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WITH reference to Cabinet Memorandum OP. 356/30,1 think my colleagues will wish to see the accompanying copy of a secret despatch sent to the Governor of British Honduras on this matter and of his reply thereto.I feel that at the present time it will be very difficult to press the Governor further in the matter, although I do not find myself in agreement with the tenor of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of his despatch.I am not prepared to threaten Imperial legislation unless we have fully made up our minds to have recourse to it, if necessary.P.Colonial Office, April 13, 1931.British Honduras. (Secret.)Sir, Downing Street, November 14, 1930.IN my Secret despatch of the 24th June, 1929, I addressed you on the subject of the increase in the quantity of whiskey imported into the Colony in 1928 compared with 1927. I now observe from the British Honduras Govern-ment &quot; Gazette &quot; of the 1st March that 174,785 gallons of whiskey were imported in 1929. This represents an increase of almost 240 per cent, over 1928. In paragraph 3 of your Secret despatch of the 24th July, 1929, it is stated that the Collector of Customs estimates that 90 per cent, of the liquor exported from the Colony is sold on the high seas, presumably for conveyance by the purchasers to the United States of America. It may be inferred from the increase in the imports of whiskey into the Colony last year that the traffic in liquor smuggling from the Colony into the United States must also have greatly increased in that period.2. Legislation has recently been enacted by the Canadian Parliament prohibiting the clearance of liquor direct to United States ports. This action may well lead to growth in the export of Canadian liquor to permissible destinations by persons engaged in the illicit traffic, and it is possible that British Honduras, owing to its geographical position, may be utilised to a greater extent than at present in the forwarding of Canadian liquor to the United States.3. Unless some action is taken to reduce the large and increasing volume of the Colony&apos;s trade in liquor, which, after making full allowance for the require-ments of legitimate trade, is already grossly out of proportion to the needs of the Colony itself, His Majesty&apos;s Government are apprehensive that incidents may occur which would evoke protests from the Government of the United States, and might seriously affect the harmonious relations at present existing between the two countries. It must clearly be admitted that the facilities which now exist in the Colony for the import, storing and re-export of liquor are such as might[5334]
reasonably be regarded as fostering, and even encouraging, the action of those persons who practise evasion of the United States law embodied in the Volstead Act.4. While it is impossible to ignore the fact that a large amount of the Colony&apos;s income is derived from the traffic in liquor, it is essential to bear in mind that the preservation of friendly relations between the Empire and the United States of America is a matter of vastly greater importance. It may also be pointed out that the existence of the illicit liquor trade is undoubtedly weakening the domestic policy of the Colony. The revenue derived from taxation on liquor provides for a considerable portion of the expenditure on social services, and to acquiesce in the continuance of such a state of affairs will ultimately aggravate financial problems, which must in any case prove sufficiently difficult.5. In view of the foregoing considerations, I shall be glad to have your observations on the steps which, in your view, could most suitably be taken to regulate this traffic, and as to the desirability of consultation with the Legislative Council in Secret Session with a view to securing effective support for any action which it may ultimately be thought necessaiy to take, and what, in your opinion, would be the most effectual method of bringing pressure to bear on the Council with a view to securing the adoption of measures to restrain the trade, for which members may otherwise be reluctant to vote.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) PASSFIELD.Governor,Major Sir John A. Burdon, K.B.E., C.M.G., &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.(Secret.)My Lord, January 19, 1931.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship&apos;s Secret despatch of the 14th November on the subject of the export of liquor from this Colony.2. The question has received my earnest consideration, and I fully appreciate the force of Your Lordship&apos;s representations and the gravity of the situation. I much regret that the Territory under my administration should be engaged in a traffic which may be regarded as conniving at the evasion of the United States law as embodied in the Volstead Act.3. In order that I might be in a position to furnish Your Lordship with an authoritative statement of the views of the Unofficial Members of Legislative Council on the subject, I have taken into my confidence the Hon. V. Bryant, Second Senior Unofficial Member of Legislative Council, to whose knowledge of local affairs I attach considerable weight, and who is in no way connected with the liquor traffic.   The following is a summary of his views : 4. The generally accepted local view of the export trade in liquor is that it is fair and legitimate business and in no way illegal. The liquor is sold outright in Belize, mostly to nationals of the United States. Its disposal is no more the concern of the local merchants than of the Exporters from the United Kingdom and Canada or of the owners of the Ships bringing it to British Honduras. The vessels in which the liquor leaves Belize do not attempt to land it in the United States, but effect sales on the High Seas.5. The Unofficial Members regard the trade in the same light and would be strongly opposed to any legislation framed to interfere with the export of liquor. They recognise that, were it not for the revenue derived from the export duty on liquor, this Colony would experience great difficulty in maintaining essential services owing to the depressed state of the markets to which the principal products from British Honduras are sent. Though the revenue may be transient, it would, in their view, be illogical not to take advantage of the money thus received to tide the Colony over the period of depression, since its cessation would
-aggravate the economic distress which is now being felt by many sections of the Community.6. In regard to the view that participation in the traffic, while not perhaps illegal, is capable of being regarded as an unfriendly act towards the United States, the contention is advanced that 50 per cent, at least of the population in the United States are opposed to prohibition, that the United States Government is not whole-hearted in its efforts to enforce it, that at the present time it is commonly reported that breweries are in full operation in such towns as Chicago, and that, even if the export of liquor were stopped from British Honduras, the export would still continue from neighbouring Republics and from other British and French possessions adjoining the United States. Also that the United States Government took no steps to prevent its nationals from engaging in legitimate trade which was detrimental to the Empire&apos;s interests during the early stages of the War.7. As to steps possible to regulate the traffic, Mr. Bryant was emphatic that no support would be forthcoming from the Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council towards the adoption of any such measures. He also considered it would be inadvisable to discuss the subject in Secret Session, since under existing conditions it is unfortunately impracticable to prevent leakage of information. That of the two courses it would be preferable to bring the matter up in Open Session, but that, in this event, the publicity given to the determination of the majority of the Council not to interfere in the traffic might serve no useful purpose.8. I inquired of Mr. Bryant what would be the attitude of the Unofficial Members if it were possible to offer a quid pro quo for the loss of the revenue from the export duty in some such form as the grant of a preferential tariff for British Honduras goods in the United States, or the removal of the existing embargo on the entry of citrous fruits. He was unable to conceive of any measure which would recompense the Colony for the loss of the revenue accruing from the export duty on liquor.9. I inquired what would, in his opinion, be the effect if the Constitution were changed to provide for an Official Majority in the Legislative Council with a view to enabling the enactment of legislation to regulate the traffic. His considered opinion was that the step would lead to a political crisis which would probably culminate in grave disorder, perhaps necessitating the use of armed forces for its suppression.10. I am satisfied that Mr. Bryant has given me a correct exposition of the attitude of the Unofficial Members towards the export of liquor from this Colony and of the difficulties which would be met with in any attempt to regulate the traffic. It is my considered opinion that I should receive no support from the majority of the Council in any measure aimed at regulating the export of liquor, but rather that every possible step would be taken in opposition to such a course. I regret that short of a change in the Constitution I am unable to suggest any method of bringing pressure to bear on the Council with a view to securing the adoption of measures to restrain the trade. I consider that to change the Constitution for this purpose would lead to a political crisis and intense local feeling against the Government which would render it extremely difficult to maintain efficient administration, and I am unable to advise the adoption of such a step.I have, &amp;c.J. A. BURDON, Governor.The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, &amp;c,    &amp;c,     &amp;c.
