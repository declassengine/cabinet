International Scheme to Regulate the Production and Export of Tin.A meeting was held in London on the 27th February to discuss proposals for an international scheme to regulate the production and export of tin. Sir John Campbell was in the Chair and the following were present : Bolivian Delegation Senor Antenor Patino.Senor Ricardo Martinez Vargas.Netherlands East Indies Delegation &apos; M. A. Groothoff. M. F. J. Houwert. M. J. van den Broek. &apos;Malayan Delegation  H. W. Thomson. Sir John Campbell.Nigerian Delegation Sir Frank Baddeley. Sir John Campbell.There were also present in an advisory capacity Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister (Chairman) and Messrs. J. Howeson, G. V. Stephens and H. Waugh (members of council), of the Tin Producers&apos; Association, Sir R. Redmayne (Chairman, Advisory Council on Minerals, Imperial Institute, and Adviser on Minerals to the Director), Mr. K. M. Lazarus, partner in Lewis Lazarus and Sons, and Messrs. W. D. Ellis, J. A. Calder and A. L. Ayton, of the Colonial Office.Complete agreement was reached at the meeting on the following points : (1) The scheme is intended to secure a fair and reasonable equilibrium between production and consumption with the view of preventing rapid and severe oscillations of price.(2) All the tonnage figures given in the following clauses are in terms of metallic tin (one ton equals 2,240 lbs.).(3) The Scheme, when approved by the authorities concerned, is to be administered by an International Committee representing the four Governments.(4) Each Government will appoint a Delegation to represent it on the Committee, consisting of not more than three Members, but each Delegation will act as a single unit. The composition of each delegation may be changed from time to time by the Government concerned.(5) Each Government will associate with its Delegation such technical advisers as it may consider desirable, and may change the number and the composition of this advisory staff from time to time.(6) It is contemplated that the scheme shall continue in operation for two years from the 1st March, 1931, and that it may then be extended for a further period if all the Governments, parties to the scheme, so decide.(7) If any of the participating Governments make a proposal to the Committee for an increase or decrease of the quotas, and if within six months unanimous agreement is not reached with regard to such a proposal, the Govern-ment which made the demand will be at liberty to withdraw from the scheme. In the event of such a withdrawal, the other participating Governments may immediately abandon the scheme.(8) Each of the four countries will be allotted a standard tonnage and a percentage quota based on the agreed figure of production in 1929.(9) The world production in 1929 is agreed by the four Governments at the following fiaures :  hp___Netherlands East Indies SiamMalaya Nigeria BoliviaBurma The RestTons. 69,366 10,412 46,338 35,730 9,939 2,443 12,190Total186,518
(10) It is agreed that the quotas of production and export under the scheme shall be based on the agreed output of 1929 in the following ratios : Per cent.Malaya ... ... ...      37-19Netherlands   East   Indies,   Bolivia   and nigeria      .... ... ... ...      49-6(11) The initial quotas are agreed as follows on the basis of a world produc-tion of 145,000 tons, which has been accepted by the four Governments as the basic world production to be aimed at in the first instance under the scheme : Malaya : 53,925 tons (37-19 per cent.).Bolivia : 34,260 tons (23-63 per cent.).Netherlands East Indies : 29^910 tons (20-63 per cent.).Nigeria : 7,750 tons (5-34 per cent.).The percentage based on these initial quotas were agreed as the ratios applicable to all alterations of the basic tonnage.(12) It is agreed that these initial quotas shall remain fixed for a period not being less than six months.Note. It was, however, pointed out that these initial quotas may prove to be too high or too low. While any change in a shorter period than three months is ruled out, it was felt that the desirability of altering the initial quotas within the first period of six months may be demonstrated; and it was decided to recommend that the participating Governments should accord authority to their delegations to propose such an alteration should urgent circumstances require it.(13) The participating Governments agree to control production so that it shall correspond as closely as possible throughout the year to their export quota.(14) The participating Governments agree that their exports for any one year, calculating from the 1st March, shall not exceed their export quota for the year, and shall be distributed as uniformly as possible throughout that period. They also agree that their exports at the end of each quarter, and the running total of exports for all the quarters which have elapsed, shall not exceed their proportionate quota of exports, taken on the full year&apos;s figure. If the quotas are altered during the year, the necessary adjustments will be made.(15) Each Government will be responsible for allotting its national quota among its individual producers, for effectively controlling its production accordingly, and for limiting, and effectively controlling, its export quota to the agreed amount.(16) It is the accepted policy of the participating Governments that altera-tions of the quotas shall be made as seldom as possible. They agreed that no change shall be made until at least three months have elapsed from the date of the preceding change.(17) Each Government will compile detailed figures of its production and export for each month, and will telegraph them monthly within ten days after the close of each month to the International Committee.^(18) The Committee will consider these official figures of production and export, and from time to time in conformity with the preceding decisions make such definite suggestions for alterations in the aggregate production and export in the four countries, as may seem to it necessary. Any increase or decrease in authorised production and export accepted by the Governments concerned will be allotted to each country in proportion to its agreed percentage ratio.(19) Each Government will be responsible for the expenses of its own Delegation and Advisers. Any common expenditure will be divided equally among the participating Governments.(20) Bolivia, Malaya and Nigeria will pass legislation to enable their Govern-ments to exercise the necessary control over production and export. It is agreed that, in the special circumstances in the Netherlands East Indies, where there is only one small independent producer, the steps necessary to control production; and export can be taken by executive order without legislation. The Netherlands East Indies Governments guarantees that it will enforce effective control of production and export by executive orders.
(21) The Governments of Siam and Burma will be invited to adhere to the. scheme. Siam will be invited to appoint a delegation to the International Committee.(22) It was decided to leave to the International Committee questions regarding the statistics it will require and the publicity to be given to its proceedings.(23) It was agreed that international co-operation in scientific research into problems connected with the tin industry was desirable; that research designed to stimulate consumption of tin was a most desirable adjunct to the International Scheme, and that the International Committee when formed should give this matter its early attention.(24) It was agreed to appoint a sub-committee consisting of M. J. van den Broek, Senor R. M. Vargas and Sir J. Campbell to determine various matters of procedure and machinery for the International Committee. The report of that sub-committee is annexed and is accepted as an agreed decision of the meeting.(25) Each delegation will arrange that the matters agreed shall be telegraphed to its Government as soon as possible for approval. It was hoped such approval would be obtained within a week or ten days. The fact of such approval, would then be formally communicated through the respective Foreign Offices.The foregoing is accepted as an accurate record of the decisions reached by the meeting held in London on Friday, the 27th February, 1931.(Signed) A.
