CABINET.IRON AND STEEL TRADE HE-ORGANISATION,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,In accordance with last week&apos;s decision of the Cabinet (Conclusion 9 of Cabinet 16 of 1931) on the subject of the Report on the Re-organisation of the Iron and Steel Industry made by Mr. Bruce Gardner,  General Manager of Securities Management Trust,  I have had an interview with Mr. Gardner for the purpose of discussing with him the action to be taken follow-ing upon the completion of his Report.    Mr. Gardner is continuing his contacts with the leaders of the industry and he informed me that there has been little,  if any,  criticism of the suggestions in his report as to the lines upon which re-organisation should be brought about in the different regions and among -the different sections of the trade.    The moment therefore seems favourable for some more general discussion,  and I have arranged with Mr. Bruce Gardner to have an early meeting with those leaders of the trade who have been co-operating with him in the preparation of his Report.    The meeting will be a private one - my aim being to secure a frank discussion of the whole matter, and in particular(a) the best method of putting Mtf. Bruce Gardner&apos;s report into operation; and(b) methods of stimulating the demand for British steel in the home market.F.G:iBoard of Trade,9th March,   1931.
