It will be understood that the opinions expressed in the Memorandum are those of the Chief of the Naval Staff.14th April, 1931.APPRECIATION OF TPIE GENERAL NAVAL SITUATION IN 1931BY THE FIRST SEA LORD.The conclusions to be drawn after careful examination of the attached review of the general Naval situation are as follows : I. The United States of America, Japan, France and Italy have increased their naval armaments and are spending large sums of money on fixed coast defences, while some of the smaller nations are either commencing or projecting the building of submarine flotillas which may constitute a much increased threat to our naval security. II. The British Commonwealth of Nations, on the other hand, has accepted a naval strength which, in certain categories, is definitely below that required to keep our sea communications open in the event of our being drawn into a war. In defensive material, in the modernisation of ships and in the provision of fleet auxiliaries and their equipment, we are below the standard maintained by other Powers and our coast defences have not been modernised for at least 25 years. III. The situation, so far as Naval Forces are concerned, has been accepted for a strictly limited period, namely, up to 31st December, 1936, and can only be maintained provided that the international conditions remain undisturbed, France and Italy considerably reduce their programme of naval construction, and other Nations agree at the next Conference to accept Naval Forces far smaller than we anticipate. Failing the fulfilment of all of these conditions, there will be no alternative but to recommend an increase in our naval strength.IV. The above conclusions make it evident that no further reductions in naval strength can be recommended beyond a decrease in the displacement and calibre of gun of the future capital ship, and that only provided other nations are in agreement with this reduction. V. Whilst appreciating the limitation in Naval Armaments which has been achieved by the Treaties of Washington and London, it is recommended that, as these Treaties are the only practical steps which have as yet been taken to limit armaments, nothing should be done at the forth-coming Conference which would still further compromise our position by upsetting these Treaties, unless it is possible to secure much greater contributions from other Countries to the limitation and reduction of Naval Armaments than have yet materialised.Admiralty(Int.)  A. V. A.(C3634)   50   4/31
The statistics furnished at the request of the Committee show clearly that  (1) There has been in recent years a substantial general reduction in the naval strength of the Commmonwealth.(2) This reduction, having been unaccompanied by proportionate reductions on the part of other Powers, has caused a pronounced decline in the relative strength of the British Commonwealth.2. When considering these facts it must be remembered that, for 100 years prior to 1914, British supremacy at sea was without serious challenge and that, behind the shield thus provided, the whole economic structure of these Islands has been revolutionized. From being self-supporting as to foodstuffs we have in that period passed to a condition of dependence upon imports for about two-thirds of our food supplies, to say nothing of the raw materials essential to the maintenance of the industries wherewith to pay for imported foodstuffs ; further, our population has grown to such an extent that it would not now be possible to produce in the country sufficient food to feed that population. This development, without parallel in history, places the country in a position of vulnerability equally without parallel.3. The experience of the late war, by the very security we enjoyed, tends somewhat to obscure appreciation both of the influence of the Navy and of the vulnerability of the British Commonwealth to pressure from the sea; careful analysis of every phase of that war, however, at once discloses the fact that the whole British effort, and indeed the whole Allied effort, was based on the axiom that command of the sea routes of the world was assured to us. While Germany sustained her war effort  or four years after her merchant ships had been banished from the oceans, this country could, in similar circumstances, hardly have endured for as many months.4. Again, apart from the vulnerability of the United Kingdom, any concerted action by the British Commonwealth as a whole depends entirely upon the communications between its constituent parts being assured to us. Failing the security of these communications the British Commonwealth is exposed to defeat in detail.5. None of the above considerations can be said to apply, in anything like the same degree, to any other Powers ; the British Commonwealth is, in fact, in a category quite by itself with regard to dependence upon the integrity of its sea communications.6. These facts have, of course, frequently been enunciated, but the Naval Staff feel that they are of such vital importance as to justify reiteration, since they should, at all times, be foremost in the thoughts of those considering measures of reduction of armaments, lest, through minimising their import, security be impaired.7. The maintenance of our sea communications, not in one particular locality, hut in all the seas of the world is in fact absolutely essential to the security of these Islands and of the British Commonwealth. Investigation of the naval problem, therefore, necessitates consideration of the naval strengths and policies of the majority of maritime States : (a) The United States of America.It has been held, on the ground that war between the two countries is an unthinkable contingency, that increase in the fleet of the U.S.A. up to parity with ourselves can be accepted.It is, however, of interest to note the differing policies which actuate the Governments of the U.S.A. and the British Commonwealth. While we have, since the war, pursued a policy of steady and progressive reduction in armaments, the U.S.A. has established her right to a navy &quot; second to none.&quot; It is impossible to contend that a self-contained sub-continent such as the U.S.A. requires such a fleet to ensure her security ; it is clear, therefore, that it can only be intended for use as an instrument of policy. In view of the fact that, in common with other nations, the U.S.A. has renounced war as a means of settling disputes, it is difficult to discover what this policy
may be. Whatever its purpose, the fact remains that the U.S.A. has made, and is making, such great increase in her naval strength as seriously to prejudice our ability to maintain our maritime belligerent rights on which our existence at any time may depend.(b) Japan.The Japanese have increased notably in relative strength since 1914 and have announced their intention of greatly strengthening their Naval Air Forces between now and 1936. Despite these increases there have been clear indications that Japan seeks to improve upon the 5:5:3 ratio established in Washington, notwithstanding the fact that, in her isolated geographical position, this ratio, in conjunction with the agreement to cease further to develop or protect any naval bases within some 2,500 miles of her coasts, would seem to render her secure against serious naval interference by any other Power. It is clear that Japan intends to incur no risks in regard to her naval security.(c) France.France, after suffering a period of naval eclipse during the war, has in recent years taken in hand seriously the reconstruction of her navy. In doing so she has concentrated largely upon the submarine arm. The experience of the late war showed that the submarine is a weapon admirably adapted for attack upon the British Commonwealths trade. The presence, therefore, of a powerful submarine fleet at our very door merits serious consideration. France has also built a large number of very fast small cruisers (classed as Flotilla Leaders although considerably larger than the maximum displacement accepted by us for this class).(ii) The geographical situation of Germany in the late war was such that her vessels, both surface and submarine, bent upon trade attack had to run the gauntlet of a force much in excess of our present total strength, which, in those days, we were able to dispose between the German ports and the distant trade routes upon which the attackers wished to operate. The conditions, therefore, peculiarly favoured our defensive measures : none the less, this attack caused us immense losses and great anxiety. In the case of France the geographical situation is reversed and would greatly favour a policy of trade attack upon the routes approaching this country, as we learned to our cost in the latter years of the Napoleonic wars. Again, France is peculiarly favourably situated in North Africa to interfere with not only our Mediterranean trade but also the vital &quot; through routes &quot; to and from the East and the Antipodes.(iii) The recent protracted negotiations give no indication that French policy inclines toward any general reduction in her naval forces either at the 1932 conference or in 1935 ; on the contrary, every indication points to the fact that she will demand a substantial increase in 1935 if not in 1932.(d) Italy.The general renaissance of Italy is clearly reflected in the Italian Navy ; the demand for parity with France is symptomatic and will certainly not lightly be abandoned. Here again, then; an increase rather than a decrease in naval strength appears probable in the future.Italy is, however, herself extremely vulnerable to maritime pressure ; for this reason her present navy cannot by itself be said to constitute a serious menace to our trade, although she is well situated to attack our important Mediterranean trade routes. In alliance, however, Italy might present a most serious problem.(e) Germany.The German navy, limited as it is by the Treaty of Versailles, cannot yet be considered a serious problem to this country.   Under the replacement clauses of the Treaty, however, a new problem will arise when more than one or two vessels of the Ersatz Preussen type.have been built. (C 3520) b 2
It is clear, however, that as time passes the enforcement of the Disarma-ment Clauses of the Versailles Treaty will become difficult to the point of impossibility ; indeed, every indication goes to show that Germany will only take part in the Disarmament Conference if she enters it on the basis of equality with the ex-allies. It also appears highly probable that at this Conference Germany will be loth to accept any ratio less than parity with France.Here again, then, an increase of naval armaments rather than a reduction is probable in the future.(/) Russia,The Russian navy is a somewhat unknown factor. It is probable that its efficiency at the present time is not high, but reports show that great efforts are being made to raise the standard.Other reports state that the belief is widely held in Russia that war is inevitable and that every possible preparation for it is being made.Russia consequently remains an unstable and incalculable factor in the European situation, and certainly no effective reduction in her armaments is to be expected to result from the forthcoming conference.(g) The smaller Naval Powers.The fleets of the smaller Powers cannot in themselves at present be regarded as seriously affecting our security. As with other Powers, however, the discussions upon armament reduction in recent years have evolved in these countries a state of mind which can only be described as &quot; armament consciousness,&quot; and all the indications show that in the name of reduction of armaments many of these Powers will demand at Geneva navies far larger than they have ever possessed before this is particularly so in the case of the new States created by the peace settlement. Further, in the smaller countries contiguous to Russia the feeling of insecurity engendered by Russia&apos;s dubious policy militates against the possibility of any reduction in their fleets, and, in fact, tends to create a demand for increased forces to enable them to resist a possible act of aggression. The demands put forward will, in many cases, apparently be mainly for submarines (Poland talks of 30 and Jugo-Slavia of 24, while we will have 40 in 1936). The development of such submarine forces would largely increase the &quot; alliance value &quot; of the small States and could not be viewed with equanimity by the Naval Staff, especially as many of these smaller Powers are situated in close proximity to important trade routes.To revert now to the comparative statistics.8. Capital Ships. (i) The reduction made by this country in this category since 1919 from 63 vessels to 15 is far greater than that made by any other country, and only became possible in consequence of the virtual elimination of the German Navy and the subsequent acceptance of the One-Power standard.(ii) The majority of the capital ships we now possess are of pre-war design. It has, therefore, been necessary to modernise them in order to incorporate the lessons learnt from war experience. A similar policy has been followed by U.S.A. and Japan, but on a much more extens;ve scale, especially by U.S.A., and it will be seen from the following table how greatly the sums expended by these two countries exceed that which we have spent for this purpose. Some further expenditure must be undertaken by us in the future, but even with this addition the total will be far below that of U.S.A. and well below that of Japan.Great Britain.Total cost of modernising the 12 capital ships (including &quot;Barham &quot; now in hand) constructeddining the war  ..       ..       ..       ..       ..  2,870,0003 post-war completed ships.
* Of this sum  2,000,000 has been appro-appropriated in 1931-32 Estimates. Total cost of modernising the 10 capital ships ofwar or pre-war construction 5 post-war completed ships.Japan.Already spent on 3 capital ships . .       . .       . .  2,652,000To be spent on 4 capital ships......  2,309,000Total cost of modernising the 7 capital ships ofwar or pre-war construction    . .       . .       . .  4,961,0002 post-war completed ships.(iii) The number of our capital ships is now so reduced that should the protection of our interests render it necessary to move our fleet to the East, insufficient vessels of this type could be left in Home Waters to ensure the security of our trade and territory in the event of any dispute arising with a European Power.No decrease in numbers could therefore be contemplated although, subject to general agreement with other Powers being reached, some reduction in the size and gun calibre of future individual vessels, with consequent economy, could be accepted.  The same remarks apply generally to Aircraft Carriers.9. When, however, the position regarding cruisers, destroyers and submarines is examined, it will be seen that, the reductions made since the war by the British Commonwealth have not been accompanied by corresponding reductions on the part of other Powers ; on the contrary, it is clear that there has been a general world increase in these categories during the period in question.10. Cruisers, (i) Our requirements in this category are conditioned by the fact that the sea communications of the British Commonwealth are of world-wide extent and consequently open to attack at innumerable points. So long, therefore, as there are in existence foreign warships capable of attacking our trade, or, indeed, while it remains possible to arm merchant vessels for such attack, it will be necessary for us to maintain a certain number of cruising ships to afford our trade the necessary defence. At the beginning of the last war we had in commission 110 and at the end 116 cruisers. Even with these numbers we suffered considerable losses and found it extremely difficult to deal with the enemy cruisers and armed raiders which operated on our trade routes, and would have been unable, even with the help of our Allies, to introduce the Convoy System in 1917, had not the U.S.A. joined the Alliance at that time.(ii) The Naval Staff have calculated that, in order to provide the essential minimum measure of defence in the several areas open to attacks a force of at least 70 cruisers is necessary. In 1930, however, in view of the political situation, the Admiralty agreed that the reduced number of 50 cruisers could be accepted for the strictly limited period of the London Naval Treaty (viz., until December, 1936). The acceptance of this number was conditional on three important provisos, namely, that -(a) a satisfactory agreement should be reached with the four major Naval Powers ;(b) no material increase should take place in the then existing Fleets of the remaining Naval Powers ;(c) there should be no deterioration in the international situation.(iii) The policy in respect of cruiser construction of Foreign Powers is at present uncertain, but it appears improbable that any material reductions in their present strengths will be made; it must be emphasised that the acceptance of 50 cruisers until 1936 was based upon the assumption that there would be no increases by foreign powers, and also that this number is, in the opinion of the Naval Staff, definitely insufficient, in the event of war, to afford security to our trade. 7,450,000 * 5,980,000 13,430,000US. A. Already spent on 7 ships the following additional expenditure has been approved, viz. : &quot; Idaho &quot;       ......  1,980,000&quot; New Mexico &quot;       . .       ..  2,030,000&quot;Mississippi&quot;......  1,970,000
11. Destroyers. The primary function of this type is to act in conjunction with the main fleet against a hostile battle fleet and other surface warships and for defence against vessels of similar type. This renders it necessary that we should possess a certain minimum number of these vessels in order to preserve the balance of the Fleet.The experience of the war showed, however, that this class of vessel was also the most effective antidote to the submarine. This is illustrated by the following table, in which is tabulated the manner of destruction of enemy submarines : Method of Destruction of German and Austrian Submarines, 1914-1918.Destroyers and Patrols . .       ..       . . 64&quot;43Mines Submarines Decoy ships Accident . . Air attack Cruisers, etc. Merchant vessels Stranding. . Own vessels Various13949Destroyed by own crews Interned188 14210At the end of the war we possessed 433 destroyers, each one of which was more than ampty employed.Under the London Naval Treaty we have been limited to 150,000 tons, equivalent to about 120 vessels of this class, and are at present only building new vessels at the rate of 9 per annum to replace those of war construction which we now possess. At this rate, out of the 120 vessels which we will have in 1936, no less than 55 will be &quot; over-age.&quot;As in the case of cruisers, the destroyer limitation accepted by us at the London Naval Conference was related to the existing strength of other Powers in this and the submarine category. Should the intentions of other Powers in regard to submarine and/or destroyer construction be translated into deeds, our present reduced destroyer allowance will be quite inadequate to combat this menace, and the rights specifically reserved under Article 21 of the London N aval Treaty to make such adjustments as may be considered necessary, will have to be exercised.12. Submarines. (i) As stated above, the submarine is a proved menace to our trade, and the increase in submarine strength by both large and small Powers cannot lightly be disregarded.(ii) In some cases, countries now contemplating the creation of considerable submarine and/or light surface craft squadrons, formerly possessed insufficient naval forces to merit our serious consideration. Although it may at present appear to be a somewhat remote contingency, it is now necessary to give consideration to the possibilit3^ of future hostile combinations of some of these hitherto comparatively negligible naval Powers.(iii) The creation or augmentation of these minor navies, in combination with the development of the submarine, presents, in fact, entirely new problems. Firstly, there has been placed in the hands of small and comparatively irresponsible peoples a power to interrupt, for a greater or less time according to circumstances, the flow of our trade in particular areas ; we are thus exposed to a possibility of damage out of all proportion to the intrinsic strength of, or the risk incurred by, the aggressor. Secondly, these developments have invested the smaller Powers with a value as allies to a possible ill-disposed major Power, vastly in excess of that which they formerly possessed.(iv) Apart from direct action against our trade, the submarine is capable of exercising a profound influence upon the conduct of cruisers and other vessels engaged upon trade protection.   It is sometimes erroneously stated that the
submarine achieved little success against war vessels in the late war ; actually, 153 warships were hit by torpedoes or mines discharged from submarines and of this number no less than 139 were sunk. The submarine also hampers enormously every operation in any area in which it may be found ships have to zigzag, heavy or valuable ships have to be screened, high speed has to be maintained, all of which reduce endurance. Further, a vast mine-sweeping and anti-submarine organisation has to be set up, and generally the mere possibility of the presence of submarines renders necessary the expenditure of immense additional effort in order to obtain even a reasonable degree of immunity from casualty.(v) As has been stated above, the destroyer has been proved to be the most effective counter to the submarine, and will consequently be required in increased numbers, should other Powers increase their submarine strengths. The submarine itself, however, achieved during the war a considerable measure of success against its like (vide table in para. 11) ; it also materially prescribed the activities of hostile submarines by imposing upon them an unaccustomed need for additional caution. So long, therefore, as other nations continue to possess submarines we must maintain as a minimum the force allotted to us under the London Naval Treaty. It is, however, considered that on the whole we have more to lose than to gain by the perpetuation of this type ; its general abolition would therefore be welcomed.13. The Fleet Air Arm. The present strength of our Fleet Air Arm is 159 aircraft and this will also be its strength on 1st March, 1932. There will also be in reserve 102 aircraft for which no pilots or personnel are available.(ii) The inadequacy of this force when compared with the naval aircraft at the disposal of other countries is shown by the following table, which gives the approximate numbers in 1932 built, building and projected : Country.	Ship or Shore.	Total.		Allocation.United States	689 shipborne 311 shore based	j- 1,000 1		576 1st line. 2S8 reserve. 136 training.Japan      ......	115 shipborne 296 shore based	j		157 1st line. 58 reserve. 196 training.Italy        ......	25 shipborne 117 shore based		y   ,42 (	142 1st line (reserves   and training in charge of Air Ministry).France	45 shipborne 266 shore based	i &quot; i		133 1st line. 48 reserve. 130 training.Russia     ..       ..	10 shipborne 130 shore based*	) 140 (		140 1st line*. (Reserves not known.)* Russia is reported to have imported or ordered 160 aircraft in addition to these figures.(iii) For reasons of economy the present policy of development of the Fleet Air Arm aims only at attaining a strength of 225 1st line aircraft by 1937. The inadequacy of this rate of development is obvious from the figures given above.(iv) Financial stringency, however, renders it difficult to adhere even to this modest policy as is evidenced by the fact that in pursuance of this aim 2 flights of aircraft (6 in each) were included in the 1931 estimates, but for reasons of economy one of these had to be deleted.14. Personal. The statistics in Appendix I show that, as in the case of material, the reduction made by the British Navy in the strength of its personnel has not been accompanied by corresponding reduction on the part of other powers. In fact comparison of the 1914 figures with those of the present day makes it clear that, while we have made enormous reductions, most of the other powers have, in the same period, increased their naval personnel, in some cases very considerably. The magnitude of the reduction made in our personnel owing to financial stringency may
be judged from the fact that even vessels in full commission are not now fully manned, and some 16,000 reservists would be needed to put the whole fleet in commission ; obviously this would entail a serious loss of fighting efficiency in ships whose crews had been suddenly drawn from civilian employment. The &quot; Queen Elizabeth &quot; class of battleships are at the present moment each some 140 seamen short of full complement and are consequently only able to man half their 6-inch guns. This is a situation without parallel in any other navy of importance, as can be seen from the following extract from the personnel statistics : United States   ..British CommonwealthJapanItaly     . .France1914 Nos. 68,075 157,000 50,645 40,023 69,5851932 Nos. 109,350 101,150 79,567 46,430 65,91515. Coast Defences. The situation revealed by the statistics dealing with Coast Defences included in Appendix II is disquieting. Table A shows that the ports of the British Commonwealth are completely without heavy gun defences while other nations count their heavy guns by hundreds. It can, in fact, be said that there are no adequately defended ports in the British Commonwealth, and that this weakness extends to anti-aircraft defences as well as to defence against sea-borne attack. This situation is the more serious in view of the reduced strength of the Navy, since the reduction may necessitate an increase in the time required by the fleet to bring relief to any threatened part of the British Commonwealth. Our defended ports should, therefore, be capable of successfully withstanding attack for longer periods than was formerly necessary.(ii) It must be emphasised that our system of trade defence requires the co-operation of the Army and the R.A.F. in the provision of secure harbours of refuge for our merchant shipping and of adequately protected naval basest in which our trade-protection cruisers, etc., can replenish their supplies. Lack of these facilities will entail wasteful dissipation of our reduced naval forces and thus seriously prejudice the efficiency of the protection which the navy could afford to our trade.16. Basis of Estimates. Superimposed upon the relative reduction in the strength of our fleet there has been since 1921 a serious retardation in the rate of building up of the stocks of fuel and stores needed to enable even the reduced fleet to operate at full efficiency. This is in accordance with the Government policy that &quot; it should be assumed for the purpose of framing the Estimates that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years.&quot;Should an emergency arise, many essential stores and munitions would be lacking, much of our warlike material would be obsolete, and for a considerable period the means of defending our ports against submarine attack would be very inadequate.17. British Commonwealth Quota. An added handicap to efficiency arises from the fact that a single tonnage quota for the British Commonwealth as a whole has been accepted in the London Naval Treaty. No matter how close the liaison maintained it is inevitable that a fleet built up of units independently administered and widely separated in peace must be less efficient than one maintained, trained and administered by one central authority. Owing to the comparatively small forces at present possessed by the Dominions, this difficulty is not yet acute but when they are able to undertake the maintenance of larger fractions of the Commonwealth Fleet it will be necessary to press for some increase in the British Commonwealth quota in order to off-set this handicap.18. Limitation of Armaments. Finally, it must be emphasised that the whole history of Limitation of Naval Armaments since the war has been one of unilateral reduction by this country.   Our relative strength has, in consequence, now been
so reduced, in anticipation of corresponding reduction by other Powers, that, unless these Powers in their turn make some substantial contribution to the cause, our position will require very serious reconsideration. Furthermore, owing to the operation of the &quot; Ten-year decision &quot; and the clamant demand for economy, our absolute strength also has, in certain directions, been so diminished as to render the fleet incapable, in the event of war, of efficiently affording protection to our trade. While-, therefore, successful efforts to limit the navies of other Powers to levels at or below their present strengths would be welcome, it is clear that it is now the turn of those Powers to follow the example set by us ; even should they do so it will, however, not now be possible for us to make further reductions since we have already more than discounted any limitations likely to be generally accepted.(Int.)

It must be realised that owing to differences in organization the figures given are hot, in all cases, strictly comparable.e.g., Some countries have conscription, others maintain voluntary forces; in some cases..naval forces are responsible for coast defence, in others this duty is performed by military personnel.For these reasons the figures should not be used without considering the explanatory notes in the column of remarks.Country.Strength.Remarks.United StatesFranceBritish CommonwealthItaly Japan109,35065.915 101,15046,43079,567GermanyRussiaJugoslavia PolandRoumania Czechoslovakia14,99723,6506,639 3,3874,904Includes Naval Air Service personnel.  Excludes coastguard.The U.S. Coastguard consists of about 12,500 men organised and trained on naval lines. The coastguard vessels are, in many cases, designed and equipped as vessels of war and the force automatically becomes part of the naval forces on the outbreak of hostilities.Includes 5,26S Air personnel and Coast Defence personnel.(i) This figure is made up as follows : -United Kingdom (Vote A, Part I), 93,650 ; British Dominions, 7,500. R.M. police (550) shown in Part II of Vote A have not been included.(ii) 875 for Fleet Air Arm are included, of which 126 are R.A.F. personnel and also included in Air Vote A.(iii) There are always a number of reserve personnel undergoing their period of training in the fleet. The average number is estimated at 700 but it varies from month to month. This number is not included in the figure given.(iv) Our peace strength is such that it is impossible to man the whole fleet allowed to us by treaties without calling out the reserves.16,000 reservists are needed to put the whole fleet in commission and, obviously, there must be a grave loss of fighting efficiency in ships whose crews have been suddenly drawn from civilian employment.The situation now is worse than in 1914 in that even our first line battleships are not allowed their full complement in peace.The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class battleships, for instance, are some 140 short of full complement and are only able to man half their 6-in. guns.This change was introduced in 1925.Excludes 31S officers as Port Captaincies (Ministry of Com-munications) and cadets. Italy has a combined Air Service, but figures for Naval Air personnel are not included as they are not available.This is the figure actually borne on 1st January, 1931, and excludes cadets.The total personnel allowed by Navy Estimates is approxi-mately 90,700, including 637 cadets, and this figure is based on the requirements to man the whole fleet.The numbers borne arc usually below the numbers voted.The approximate figure for Air personnel is 16,500.The Naval personnel mans, in addition to ships and bases, all coast defence and a network of storm signal stations, D/F stations, information stations, and W/T stations.Germany is limited to 15,000 personnel by the Peace Treaty of Versailles.  No Air personnel are allowed.Latest figure available.   (1928.)Air service personnel are not known.Includes about 1,000 Air Service personnel and 105 cadets.Includes 338 attached to Naval Air Service. Excludes about 70 cadets. Numbers actually borne in October, 1930, were 3.300, excluding 305 Naval Air Service and 80 cadets.Includes 55 cadets and some Air Service personnel, numbers not known. A separate Naval Air Service has recently been formed.There is no Navy proper or Navy Estimates, but a &quot; water battalion &quot; is maintained for submarine mining and river patrols, etc.

APPENDIX U-could.COAST DEFENCES.1. In their Review of Imperial Defence, 1930, prepared for the C.I.D. and Imperial Conference by the Chiefs of Staffs in July, 1930 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1009), amongst the liabilities imposed on the Army by the National Defence Policy the following was placed first: &quot; [a) Assistance in the maintenance of our sea communications by the provision of garrisons at important points along our sea routes.&quot; It is in accordance with this principle that the provision of the gun defences at our defended ports has always been an Army commitment.2. In the same paper it is stated that &quot; The security of our sea communications is as essential as ever for the continued existence of the Empire; adequate defence for the defended ports of the latter&apos;s main lines of communication is an essential factor in ensuring that security.&quot; Although recognised as an &quot;essential factor,&quot; however, the attitude adopted by the British Common-wealth for the last 30 years towards the Defence of Ports and Naval Bases is in marked contrast to that of practically all other Powers.3. Prior to the war, the 9-2-in. gun had been adopted as the heaviest anti-bombardment gun to be mounted in British Defended Ports, and a total of 116 of these guns had been mounted in 25 ports. The remaining defended ports were mostly armed with 6-in. guns. To-day the heaviest gun mounted for the defence of British ports is still the 9-2-in., and the position has only altered in that the total number of guns in place has been reduced to 96. In order to provide an adequate gun deterrent against bombardment at ports liable to attack by modern &quot; ships of the line &quot; it would be necessary to mount guns of 12 in. or greater calibre.  At present none have been mounted.4. The present old type 15&quot; mountings cause the 9-2-in. gun, our heaviest existing anti-bombard-men t gun, to be outranged even by comparative^ small modern cruisers such as the &quot; Leander,&quot; armed only with 6-in. guns. The remounting of these 9-2-in. guns on 30o mountings is an urgent requirement. When this is done, and given suitable ammunition, these guns will outrange the 8-in. guns carried by the larger modern cruisers and will be a suitable deterrent against cruisers of all types. The present supply of ammunition for the 9-2-in. guns is of pre-war type and known to be of little value against modern ships. The supply of modern ammunition should be undertaken without delay.5. In view of the almost complete stagnation since the war in the provision of coast defence for the British Commonwealth, a survey of the progress in this direction made by other countries proves most disquieting [see Tables A and B attached). It will also be noticed that the possession of a large air force is not considered by other countries as discounting the value of coast defence in fact, the opposite is clearly stated to be the American view by the Acting Chief, War Plans Division, presenting the 1931 estimates before the House Committee, when he said- &quot; The advent of aviation, therefore, has not obviated the need of maintaining fortifications for the defence of our coasts against naval attack. It has, however, brought with it a new need, the anti-aircraft weapon. This arm, in providing a local defence against air attacks, bears to aviation a relation largely analagous to that of coast fortifications to the Navy and the mobile land forces, tending to free aviation for its most advantageous employment.&quot;France, who possesses the largest air force of all, U.S.A., Italy and Spain all have considerable programmes for the provision of coast defences. A comparative estimate of the air force strength of these countries can be approximately obtained from the number of &quot; First Line &quot; planes maintained by them in 1930 as follows :- ....      1,319France - *- 1106Italy .. -        - &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;      &quot;                .     1^56U.S.A. v -- &quot;*        -    780Great Britain ...... 522Spain .. - - - - *&quot; 122 Holland6. The policy followed by other countries since the war can be gauged by the following examples : (i) US.A. (Extracts from Coast Defence Programme).[a) Provision of thirty-two 16-in. guns, of which 16 were completed in 1927.[b) In addition to some of the guns in [a) above, the Panama Canal defences havebeen incieased by two 14-in.guns on railway mountings, 52 mobile 6-in. guns, 44 anti-aircraft guns.(ii) italy .   Intends to spend approximately /&quot;l ,300,000 on coast defences during the period 1931-37.(iii) Spain.   (Extracts from Coast Defence Programme.)Eight 15-in. guns have been mounted and positions are being prepared for another twelve.(iv) France has voted a total of  \,290,000 for coast defences at Home Ports since 1922.
7. The following examples of the defences, reported to be installed at important naval ports, show the marked difference in the scale of defence provided by the various foreign Powers as compared to the British i  PlymouthBritish Commonwealth        ..       ..       ..       ..       ..        6 9-2-in. guns.6 6-in. guns.Boston.U.S.A.................        2-16-in. guns.9 12-in. guns. 20 12-in. mortars. 13 10-in. guns. 7 6-in. guns.Keelung, Formosa.Japan   ..       ..       ..       ..       ..       ..       .....        6 12-in. guns.6 11-in. guns. 9 9-4-in. guns. 6 8-2-in. guns. 7 5-9-in. guns.Brest.France ..       ..       ..       ..       ..       ..       ..       ..        4 13-5-in. guns.48-12-59-in. guns. 4 11-S-in. howitzers. 12 10-6-in. howitzers. 38-9-4-in. guns. 12 -5-9-in. guns.Brindisi.Italy &apos;   ..       ..............        4 15-in. guns.12 12-in. howitzers. 18 6 in. guns.Leningrad and Approaches.U.S.S.R. ..............        4 14-in. guns.S 12-in. guns. 24 11-in. guns. IS 9-in. guns. 3S 6-in. guns.8. The serious weakness of anti-aircraft defences at British Ports is also a matter for considerable anxiety, as little progress has been made in the provision of even the low scale recommended. How weak our position is compared to other countries can be seen by contrasting the anti-aircraft defences of Honolulu and Malta. At Honolulu, immune as it is from shore-based air attack, there are some 70 anti-aircraft guns, whereas at Malta, within easy reach of attack by large air forces; there are at present mounted only 2 anti-aircraft guns, and another 6 are being added this year.9. A summary of the coast defences of the following countries is attached : British Commonwealth. Russia.U.S.A. Germany.Japan. Poland.France. Rumania.Italy. Jugo-Slavia.
