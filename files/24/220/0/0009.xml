DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIG BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1S GOVARNf-AANT )R 5 T . 9(31)COPY NO,CABINETREORGANISATION OP THE COTTON INDUSTRY,Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade.It was agreed at the Cabinet on the 18th February that, when meeting the representatives of the Cotton Industry the same afternoon; we should make clear to them the determination of the Government to expedite the reorganisation of the Cotton Industry and should have authority to discuss with them the best means for carrying out their intention and the most suitable person or persons to be employed.This meeting had been arranged in order that we might ascertain what progress had been made in relation to the re-commendations of the Cotton Report since our last visit to Manchester shortly before Christmas.      As we expected,  the inter-vening period has largely been taken up with the dispute in the weaving section.      We learned however that the general question of the progress of reorganisation in the industry had been the subject of discussion at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisation on February 13th, at which the problem presented by the generally admitted excess of productive capacity in the various sections of the industry had been touched upon,  and a decision reached that there should be prepared for the consideration of the Joint Committee a memorandum on the subject of the regulation of productive capacity.      It was evident from the statements made by the various representatives that the subject is one upon which there is a considerable
divergence of opinion in the industry.when the discussion reached this stage, we asked the representatives present whether they thought that mattor8 would, he helped in any way if some outstanding business man (or perhaps two such men) went to Lancashire with the object of endeavouring;,  in consultation with the various sections of the industry j to produce a scheme of reorganisation^, which would . include proposals for the regulation of productive capacity.The representatives naturally asked for time to consider this suggestion.      But thoy fully realised that urgent action was necessary and promised that they would call an early meeting of the Executive Committee to consider the whole matter, and that they would let us have their views immediately thereafter.(Intld. ) J.R.G;23rd February, 1931.
