DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.      2 p 7Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1931.it-SECRET. Copy No.CP. 77 (31).CABINET.AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE IRISH FREE STATE AS TO THE REGISTRATION AND CONTROL OF VETERINARY SURGEONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I DESIRE to bring to the notice of my colleagues the question of the enactment of legislation in this country to give effect to the recently signed Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Tree State as to the registration and control of Veterinary Surgeons.2.   The facts are as follows : By various Charters dating from 1844 onwards, and by the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1881, and subsequent amending Acts, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was empowered to conduct examinations, grant diplomas and administer the registration of qualified veterinary Surgeons in the United Kingdom. As a result of the establishment of the Irish Free State, it became impracticable for the College to carry out their functions in the Irish Free State, since the Irish Free State Government were of opinion that the Veterinary Surgeons Acts had ceased to be operative in the Irish Free State. The steps to be taken to regularise the position have formed the subject of negotiations with the Irish Free State Government for some years in close consultation with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the Royal College continuing in the meantime to hold examinations in Dublin at the request of the Irish Free State. In November 1930, the negotiations resulted in the signing by Mr. McGilligan and myself, on behalf of our respective Governments, of the Agreement which is printed as the first Appendix to this Memorandum.3. The Agreement follows generally the solution reached in the somewhat similar question of the supervision of the medical and dental professions in the Irish Free State. This, it will be remembered, was regulated by the Medical and Dentists Acts (Amendment) Act, 1927, which embodied and confirmed a similar Agreement. It may be mentioned that, in that case, unlike the present one, the circumstances required that the Government of Northern Ireland should sign the Agreement separately.The main principle of the Veterinary Agreement consists of the proposed establishment in the Irish Free State of a Council for the purpose of registering and controlling veterinary surgeons in the Irish Free State, which will be in close connection with the Royal College (since the four members of the Irish Free State Council are also to be additional members of the Council of the Royal College), and the proposed keeping of two Registers a General Veterinary Register and an Irish Free State Veterinary Register, with reciprocal entitlement to registra-tion on each register of duly qualified persons. The subsidiary arrangements provided for in the Agreement as regards the holding of examinations, the granting of diplomas and the admission to and removal from the respective registers, follow the above main principle, and need not be set out here in detail.4. The Agreement provides (Clause 10) that both Governments shall, as soon as possible, &apos;&apos; introduce into their respective Parliaments such legislation as may[5250] b
be necessary to give statutory effect to this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not take effect until such legislation in both such Parliaments shall have been passed into law.&quot; It has been clear throughout that legislation would be necessary in the Irish Free State to implement the Agreement, since the action to be taken in the Irish Free State in effect amounts to making provision ab initio in the Irish Free State for the registration and control of veterinary surgeons and the practice of veterinary surgery. As regards legislation in the United Kingdom, it was thought, while the negotiations with the Irish Free State were in progress, that legislation would probably be necessary on the ground that the proposed Agreement, in the draft form in which it was at first discussed, appeared to go beyond the provisions of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1881, and subsequent amending Acts, in certain respects, though not inconsistent with them in principle. In the course of the negotiations, however, the draft of the Agree-ment was modified in various directions, and when it came to be signed I was advised that in its final form it was not ultra vires the 1881 Act and subsequent amending Acts, and that there appeared therefore no reason why United Kingdom legislation to confirm it was required. The Irish Free State Government were informed by me accordingly on the 17th November, 1930.5. On the 9th December I received from the Irish Free State Government, in reply, the despatch of which a copy forms the second appendix to this memorandum. It will be seen that they strongly contest the view that legislation in the United Kingdom to confirm the Agreement is not necessary.6. I need not perhaps enter into the legal or quasi-legal arguments advanced in this despatch in support of the Irish Free State Governments contention. I have since seen the text of the Irish Free State Bill which had been introduced into the Dail before the Irish Free State despatch referred to was sent. It is drafted in such a form as to secure that the United Kingdom Parliament shall legislate confirming the Agreement before the Agreement can come into effect. In view of this, the question whether legislation here is, in fact, legally necessary from the point of view of the United Kingdom has become academic to this extent that, in the event of such legislation here being held to be unnecessary, the practical question would arise of asking the Irish Free State Government to amend their Bill. From the point of view of policy it would seem very unwise to ask the Irish Free State Government to do this, having regard to the political difficulties to which such a course would inevitably expose them; for the Free State Government to have to explain in the Dail that legislation was required in the Irish Free State but not in the United Kingdom could hardly fail to place them in an awkward position politically as tending to give the appearance of a one-sided arrangement rather than a reciprocal one.Moreover, from our own point of view, it is desirable as a general rule to proceed by reciprocal action in all dealings of this kind with the Irish Free State.7. In the present case, it is to our advantage as wrell as to that of the Irish Free State to have the Agreement in force, without any possibility of question, as soon as may be, and the Irish Free State Government have, on the whole, met us very fairly in what has been a long and troublesome business. In ali the circumstances, I submit that, for the reasons which I have indicated, it would, as a matter of policy, be wise not to contest the Irish Free State view, and to introduce legislation here.8. I trust, therefore, that I shall have the Cabinets approval for the early introduction into Parliament of a Bill to implement the Agreement, and that I may be authorised to inform the Irish Free State Government at once&quot; that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom propose to take this action. The Bill would take the form of a short one-clause Bill on the lines of Section (1) (1) of the Medical and Dentists Acts (Amendment) Act, 1927. It has been ascertained that the Royal College of V eterinary Surgeons would have no objection to the introduction of such a measure; and the Bill should be quite uhcontroversial and take up the minimum of Parliamentary time.9. In the event of my colleagues agreeing to the above suggestions, I would propose to notify the Leaders of the Opposition of the action contemplated and, in so doing, to draw their attention to the non-contentious nature of the suggested legislation.March 25, 1931.

(1) The Irish Free State Veterinary Council shall in every year pay to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons the sum of one guinea in respect of every person (subject to the exception hereinafter made) who during that year or any part thereof is registered in the Irish Free State veterinary register and is also registered in the general veterinary register and pays to the Irish Free State Veterinary Council in respect of his registration in the Irish Free State veterinary register the annual fee payable for such registration.(2) No annual fee shall be payable to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons by a person in respect of whom and for a year for which the sum of one guinea is paid to the said Council by the Irish Free State Veterinary Council in accordance with this clause.(3) The sum of one guinea shall not be payable under this clause by the Irish Free State Veterinary Council to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons for the year in which the Irish Free State veterinary register is established in respect of any person who is registered in that register at the establishment thereof and either has paid an annual fee to the Council of the said College for that year or has paid in that year a registration fee to the Council of the said College.(4) In this clause the word &quot;year&quot; means a period of twelve months commencing on any 1st day of April and ending on the next following 31st day of March.7. (1) Whenever a person registered in both the general veterinary register and the Irish Free State veterinary register is alleged to have been guilty of conduct disgraceful to him in a professional respect, then (a) if either such person practises as a veterinary surgeon exclusively outside the Irish Free State, or such person practises as a veterinary surgeon both outside and within the Irish Free State, and the disgraceful conduct is alleged to have been committed, or (in the case of continuing conduct) begun outside the Trish Free State, the powers of investigating such allegation, and, if such allegation is proved, of removing the name of such person from the general veterinary register, shall be exercisable by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons under the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts as heretofore, and the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons shall report to the Irish Free State Veterinary Council every case in which it is determined to remove from the general veterinary register the name of any person registered in the Irish Free State veterinary register, and such report shall be conclusive as to the fact, but so That the Irish Free State Veterinary Council shall form their own judgment on the case independently of any opinion of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and act accordingly; and
&apos; (b) if either such person practises as a veterinary surgeon exclusively within the Irish Free State or such person practises as a veterinary surgeon both within and outside the Irish Free State and the disgraceful conduct is alleged to have been committed, or (in the case of continuing conduct) begun within the Irish Free State, such allegation shall, subject to the subsequent provisions of this clause, be investigated by a committee of the Irish Free State Veterinary Council under powers in that behalf to be conferred on that council by legislation of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State.(2) Any legislation of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State conferring on the Irish Free State Veterinary Council powers of investigating allegations of conduct disgraceful in a professional respect made against persons who are registered in both the general veterinary register and the Irish Free State veterinary register shall limit such powers to cases coming within paragraph (h) of the foregoing sub-clause and shall provide that such investigation shall be made by a committee consisting of three members of the Irish Free State Veterinary Council (of whom at least one shall be a person who is also a member of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons), appointed by the Irish Free State Veterinary Council and two members of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons appointed by that Council.(3) A Committee constituted in the manner specified in the foregoing sub-clause and appointed under legislation of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State to investigate an allegation of disgraceful conduct in a professional respect coming within paragraph (b) of sub-clause (1) of this clause shall, for the purposes of the Charters and the Veterinary Surgeons Acts, be deemed to be a committee-of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons appointed&quot;&apos; by that Council under the said Acts. The power of removing from the Irish Free State veterinary register the name of any person Avhose conduct becomes the subject of an investigation by such committee as aforesaid shall be exercisable by the Irish Free State Council under the provisions in that behalf of the legislation to be passed by the Oireachtas. The Irish Free State Council shall report to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons every such case in which it is determined to remove from the Irish Free State Register the name of any such person and such report shall be conclusive as to the facts, but so that the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons shall form their own judgment on the case independently of any opinion of the Irish Free State Council and act accordingly.(4) Where, as a result of an investigation held under paragraph (a) of sub-clause (1) of this clause, the name of any person is removed from the general veterinary register and such person applies to have his name restored to that register, the Council of the Royal. College of Veterinary Surgeons shall report such application to the Irish Free State Council and its determination thereon.(5) Where as a result of an investigation held under paragraph (b) of sub-clause (1) of this clause the name of any person is removed from the Irish Free State veterinary register and such person applies to have his name restored to that register the Irish Free State Veterinary Council shall report such application to the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and its determination thereon.(6) The legislation to be passed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State may provide that an appeal from a decision of the Irish Free State Veterinary Council removing from the Irish Free State veterinary register the name of any person registered therein or refusing to restore thereto the name of any person removed therefrom shall be to the High Court of the Irish Free State and to no other court or tribunal.8. At every examination held in the Irish Free State by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the said Council shall, on the nomination of the Authorities of any college, school or institution in the Irish Free State affiliated to the said Royal College, appoint the principal teacher of a subject in that school or his deputy to act as third or internal examiner in that subject of students educated at that college, school or institution, but such third or internal examiner shall not set the written questions at such examination.9. At every examination held in the Irish Free State by the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the said Council and the Irish Free State
Veterinary Council shall each be entitled to be represented by delegates appointed bv the said cduncils respectively for the purpose of observing the conduct of such examination and reporting thereon to the said councils respectively.10. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State shall, as soon as possible, introduce into their respective Parliaments such legis-lation as may be necessary to give statutory effect to this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not take effect until such legislation in both such Parliaments shall have been passed into law.Signed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Signed oh behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United King- Government  in the Irish Freedom   of   Great   Britain   and State, Northern Ireland,J. H. THOMAS. P. McGILLIG AN.APPENDIX II.D.4521.Despatch No. 290. Department of External Affairs,Sir, Irish Free State, December 9, 1930.I HAVE the honour to refer to your despatch No. 359, dated the 17th November, enclosing two copies of the Agreement regarding the registration and control of Veterinary Surgeons, which have been signed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United) Kingdom. Both copies of the Agreement have now been signed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, and I accordingly enclose one of the copies so signed.2. With regard to the view expressed in paragraph 2 of your despatch, namely, that no legislation will be necessary in the United Kingdom Parliament to give statutory effect to the Agreement, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State have the following observations to make.3. Clause 10 of the Agreement provides that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State shall, as soon as possible, introduce into their respective Parliaments such legislation as may be necessary to give statutory effect to the Agreement, and that the Agreement shall not take effect until such legislation in both such Parliaments shall have been passed into law. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State are advised that the Agreement could have no statutory authority in the United Kingdom, and, accordingly, would not be cognisable by the Courts of the United Kingdom unless and1 until it is confirmed by a Statute of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. His Majestj^s Government in the United Kingdom will recollect that in the discussions which took place in connection with the Agreement every endeavour was used to provide a machinery which would, as far as possible, in so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, fit into the existing law relating to veterinary surgeons in force in the United Kingdom. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State did not, however, take the view that no legislation would be necessary in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to confirm the Agreement itself and give it statutorj- force in the United Kingdom. They base themselves on the assumption that an Agreement cannot have statutory force unless such force is given to it by a confirmatory Act of Parliament. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State feel that the view expressed in paragraph 2 of despatch No. 359 may be based upon a misapprehension as between the legislation necessary to confirm the Agreement itself and the legislation (if any) amending the existing veterinary law in the United Kingdom, which may be necessary to carry out the reciprocal arrangements provided for in the Agreement.4. With regard to the view expressed in paragraph 2 of your despatch that &apos;&apos; The Agreement .... will take effect as soon as any legislation necessary to give statutory effect to it in the Irish Free State has been passed by the
Oireachtas,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State feel that having regard to the terms of Clause 10 of the Agreement, which clearly contemplate confirmatory legislation by both Parliaments, the Agreement could not take effect at all unless such legislation- were passed by both Parliaments. It is suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Government in.the United Kingdom that such confirmatory legislation might take the form of sub-section (1) of section 1 or sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Medical and Dentists Acts Amendment Act, 1927, which gave the force of law in the United Kingdom to the Agreements contained in Parts I and II respectively of the Schedule to that Act.5. Adverting to Article 2 of the Agreement, it would appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State that statutory effect must be given in the United Kingdom to the provisions of that Article for the purpose of removing any doubts as to the validity of diplomas qualifying for registration in the general veterinary register granted since the establishment of the Irish Free State.Furthermore, they would point out that as the constitution of the Committee contemplated by Clause 7 of the Agreement differs from that referred to in section 8 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1881, it is difficult to see how, as a matter of law, the new Committee could have any legal existence at all, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, unless and until legislation confirming the Agreement is passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State feel that the conclusion which they have drawn from the foregoing considerations coercively follows and would suggest for the further consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom the view that the necessity for legislation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom confirming the Agreement is free from doubt. They would be glad to learn whether, on further consideration, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom does not share that view.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) P. McGILLIGAN,Minister for External Affairs.The Right honourable the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.o
