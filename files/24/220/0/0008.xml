S opOCyMgJT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT. iEHTIAL. Copy No,SECRET. P.58T31).CABINET. State of Trade. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The reports for January reflect a position of increasing seriousness, the major indexes of prosperity showing in each case a further adverse change.Comparing January this year with January 19 30, exports declined by 36^;    imports by 26&apos;..    In considering these figures regard   must of course be had to the corresponding fall in wholesale prices, the index for which was 78.8 in January 1930, 65.5 in December, 1930 and 64.3 in January 1931 (1924 ^ 100), a fall of about ISfj in the year.The general unemployment percentage was 21.3 on January 26th, 1931, as compared with 20.2 on December 22, 1930, and 12.6 on January 27, 1930, while the decline in the number of insured persons estimated to be in employment was from 10,065,000 (January 27, 1930) to 9,248,300 (January 26, 1931) including: those involved in the Lancashire cotton dispute, or 8?i.Railway traffic receipts which for the year 1950 fell 5.7fo compared with 1929,  in January 1931 were lower by lCfo than a year ago.    The shipping freight index stood at 88.1 as compared with 89.7 a month ago - but was better than a year ago (83.6).    The amount of shipping laid up is estimated at practically 10f* of the whole world&apos;s tonnage, 1,330,000 tons net (mostly British) being laid up in the British Isles.New issues of capital for January were unusually small. To turn to the only features of comparative brightness in the
situation which are of any importance, mention may he made of the relative steadiness in the prices of raw materials for the textile trades, notwithstanding in the case of cotton the dispute which is now fortunately at an end.    For   the building trade there is some promise of increased activity next year, since the volume of new work passed by the Local Authorities during the last four years (1927-1930) has progressively increased and this should be felt during 1931.    Both the co-operative societies and the departmental stores report that though cash receipts have declined,  the volume of goods sold has increased in respect of all the main commodities.    The former&apos;s banking figures also show a large increase - from  44,000,000 to  56,000,000 or nearly 28%, and the comparatively strong position of the Co-operative Movement is, it seems, not entirely due to increased membership.    The number of new motor registrations during December was 10;;u better than a year ago. The reports of new engineering contracts, though certainly fewer than is necessary to keep the industry properly going, show vitality and promise.While, as already indicated, unemployment was greater at January 26th, than at December 2 2nd (for which the aggregate percentages are alone available) the total number of unemployed decreased during January by about 19,000.    This was due to a decrease of some 150,000 in the numbers temporarily stopped, as compared with an increase of 131,000 in the number of wholly unemployed.    There was some improvement in the steel and motor vehicle industries, but the electrical, engineering,  shipbuilding, textile, building and distributive trades all showed a further decline of employment.The coal trade showed some slight improvement in December compared with November both in employment and in exports, but last month production was heavily reduced by the South Wales coal stoppage and conditions generally have been far from
satisfactory.    Complaints were made of foreign competition anddumping,  especially from Polish coal, the price (f.o.b.Danzig)of which had fallen from 17/3 per ton at the end of 1929 toll/3 at the end of 1930.    Polish wages costs per ton aregiven as 3/7 (very little more thsnlherate &quot;before the war -estimated at about 3/-) as compared with 8/9 in Great Britain(or half as much again as before the warj.    The adoption ofthe quota schemes is alleged to be causing disorganisation and unemployment in the mining industry, and in Scotland it isstated that some collieries are suffering seriously from therestriction of output.    while it is certainly the c ase that the incidence of unemployment is to a limited extent beingaffected by the quota system, the Mines Department do notconsider that the quota system is causing unemployment.    Theallocation of coal by the Central Council to the various districts provides for the production of as much coal as it is reasonable to expect will be sold during the current qu-rter,and as these allocations are passed on by district standardtonnage and quota schemes to the individual collieries, it follows that, in so far as there is additional unemployment......compared with last quarter, this is due not to Part 1. ofthe Coal J^ines Act but to a reduction in markets.    There is no present indication of an improvement in these markets.There is no improvement to report in the iron andsteel industry.    The very low number of furnaces in blastin December was reflected as anticipated in a heavy declinein the production of pig iron in January,  in which month therewas a net increase of only seven furnaces blown in.    At thebeginning of the year a reduction of 5/-- per. ton was madein Cleveland iron, in the hope that this would curtailimports;    the January production of steel shows some improvement due to accumulation over the holidays, but orders,especially from shipbuilding yards, are very scarce and future prospects poor.    Continental prices have fallen again-3-
6 Vand imports of iron and steel were once more in excess of exports, though both were less than in December.    The condition in Scotland is very bad.    Scottish pig iron remains quite non-competitive in price with Continental and Indian iron;    one steel works closed down altogether at the end of the year and the remainder are only working intermittently.Several important orders have been obtained by the engineering industry, including one for engines for the Chinese Railways, a specially important order for the complete equipment of a foundry and what is probably the largest single order in this country for a power plant.    Generally, however, the outlook is not promising and negotiations are proceeding with the Trade Unions with a view to the reduction of production costs.The  state of the motor industry gives grounds for anxiety.    As already stated there was a 10,6 increase in the number of new registrations for the month of December, while there is a fair demand for light vehicles and the British small car is gaining ground in the export markets,  especially the Dominions, but the demand for heavier types is not so good and obstacles in the export markets have increased owing to exchange difficulties in Australia and New Zealand, combined with continued liquidation of American surplus stocks. The motor tyre business has been fairly good though the results of the Motor Show were disappointing.There has been no improvement in Shipbuilding and no orders for tramp steamers have been placed for six months.The chief features of the shipping position have already b^en referred to.    There has been very little change in the wheat position.    Neither Canada nor the United States of America have met with much success in their efforts to dispose of their crops.    A heavy crop is being shipped from Australia at lower prices.    Supplies are also heavy in the
  6Argentine and the crop prospect in India has improved. Great Britain during January out s*f a total import of 7,300,000 took nearly 3,000,000 cwt. from Russia, displacing that amount from the United States and the Argentine.    It appears, however,  that less wheat is now being loaded in Russian ports.    Russia is still doing some chartering (including some for sugar for India), but British shipowners are unwilling to give Russia the credit she asks for contrary to the custom of the trade.January figures for the Railways show a ten per cent fall as compared with January 1930;    the decrease for the year 1930 compared with 1929 was 5.7%:.    It was pointed out that the United States and German Railways have been even more seriously hit by the present depression, but bad trade in other countries merely adds to our difficulties.    There was a reduction of 23^ million tons in railway freight traffic for the first 11 months of last year as compared with the corresponding period for 1929;    of this 13 million tons was in coal and 5-g- million tons in iron ore, iron and steel.In the chemical trade the usual increase ill January has been entirely absent this year, a reflection of the state of depression in chemical-using industries,  among which the only signs of increased activity are confined to certain branches of the artificial silk and paper industries, while rubber, soap and glass appear to be comparatively active. Complaint was wade of Russia getting a large order for heavy chemicals from Japan by quoting at a price so many pounds below whatever may be the English offer.Owing to the dispute in Lancashire there was little to report as regards the cotton industry, but it was stated that the boycott in India had,  if anything, intensified since the closing down of the Round Table Conference.    (But see page below).    Wool values fell still further in
i oJanuary,  reaching the record for a century, hut there was a remarkable recovery at the end of the month resulting in a more hooeful tone.    The improvement in the worsted section has been maintained and it is hoped that there will be the normal seasonal expansions   Made-up garments according to the report from 3radford are still dear enough to preclude the purchase by the public of more clothing than is really necessary.     On the whole the machinery activity is as good as in most Eurooean countries and better than in the United States of America.The hosiery industry is. very quiet and the export trade is stated to be below normel.    The decline in the value of the raw materials makes trading difiicult and will probably continue to do so for some time.   Attention was drawn to the increasing quantities of foreign made hosiery imported in the rough and finished in this country.Some improvement locally has obtained in the boot and shoe trade;   but in the main centres (Northampton and Leicester) the position is not yet satisfactory.The building industry remains very depressed and, thotigh this is, no doubt, partly seasonal, it is true that the oast year has been one of bad degression for building as for other industries,,    In the present year, as has been mentioned,  there &quot;is some hope of improvement based on the increased volume of new work approved by Local Authorities.Petoil trade both in the large distributing stores and in the Co-operative stores continues to show improvement in volume,  though, owing to the fell in prices, not in value. The figures for January have not yet been received, but the receipts for the sales, especially in the West End stores, are expected to touch record levels.    The disparity between v/wholesale and retail prices which had been recently remarkable has nor been largely reduced for the orincipal foodstuffs.
Money rates rose to 3 per cent, from about 1 per cent, during January?    the cause, however, was not an improvement in the industrial situation, hut the desire of the authorities to check the export of gold which was stimulated by the decision of the Bank of France to accept gold of 9/10 ths fineness.   The rise in interest rates was successful in raising both the franc scad the dollar rates above the gold export points and gold withdrawals on French account ceased, though France continues to take fine gold arriving in London.   The price of silver at 12d per oz. has reached the lowest on record and constitutes a serious hindrance to trade with silver-producing or using, countries.Trade with Australia continues to be affected by the exchange position, the imports for the six months ending last December being only slightly over half the value for the same period the year before.    Exports also decreased though not to the same extent.    Owing to the inability of the Commonwealth Bank to advance the necessary 3/- per bushel, the ,/heat advances Act, 1930, has not so far been brought into operation and the Commonwealth Government are considering the whole question of assistance to the wheat industry.The import trade of India fell last year by 26 per cent, and her export trade by 22 per cent., but in the same period wholesale prices fell by 18 per cent.      It was pointed out that, in spite of the boycott, the United Kingdom share of the import trade has only fallen from 42.4 per cent, in 1929 to 40 per cent,  in 1930.There is no improvement in the general position in the Colonies.    Practically all Colonial products are, it is stated, being sold below the cost of production and the respective Governments are receiving urgent requests for assistance.The south American countries are suffering fromdepression ov?ing partly to exchange difficulties.    Loss of-7-
8tocrops in the Argentine lest year affected the exchange, hut the harvest this year promises to h e good.    It was pointed out that the competition of Russian wheat, which as indicated above is at the moment lrrgely replacing Argentine wheat in our imports,  is calculated to affect seriously the large British interests in the Argentine,  especially railways and other similar undertakings.    Orders from them lor rails and the like have fallen off very much recently.    It is, however, hoped that the forthcoming British Empire Exhibition in Buenos Aires will helo to remedy this situation and it may be added that orders have been received from tile Argentine for 60 Morris Commercial Motors.    The prospects in Brazil are affected by the large stocks of coffee which are estimated to amount to practically one year1s world consumption.Board of Trade, 26th   February,  1931.

Q 9 O 6MEETING- OF THE BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL HELD ON-18-th FEBRUARY,  1951.PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:    Gentlemen,  I am afraid I always owe you an apology, I have a meeting at 10.30 this morning which I must attend so from that time my colleague Mr. Walter Smith will take the Chair at this meeting.CHEMICALS.DR. CLAYTON:    The general situation has remained substantially unchanged with the advent of the New Year,  and though orders for chemical products are possibly more numerous, they are confined to very small parcels.    That usual increment in the January trade, due to the holding over of end of year business has been entirely lacking in the period under review.The overseas trade of December last was not exceptional to the general run of 1930, so far, at least, as chemicals were concerned, and the drop in exports in the chemical group as compared with the last months of 1929 approached 60$ of the corresponding figure for the earlier months.    On the year, the decrease was some 17$ of the 1929 total.    As a group coal tar products suffered most,  especially if one considers    the position from the gas producers point of view,  as ammonium sulphate shows a phenomenal fall in the export business-e^    this drop amounted to over 20% in the value of the year&apos;s exports, while creosote exports were only two-thirds of those of 1929, and less than half the 1928 experts.Heavy Chemicals,There are still no indications of a general revival in the principal consuming trades, and deliveries to the home markets remain below normal.Whilst the soap and glass industries appear not to be suffering from the depression to the extent of other industries,  there is no sign of recovery in the textile trade.Certain branches of the artificial silk industry show some slight improvement but others remain in a position unchanged from that previously reported.Competition is still being felt from Russian goods in certain overseas markets,  particularly in Japan, where recent imports of Russian caustic soda have been heavy.There is one very big order which has been taken by the Russians in Japan that previously we have always held and it is at a figure very much below what we could possibly deliver at,  a figure we could not possibly produce at.. They are offering in all these markets at a definite figure of so many pounds a ton below the offer that we put in. They do not give any fixed figure,  they simply say that they will take so many pounds a ton less than we are offering-
P-9 0 other   Is nothing new to report in regard to sulphuric and hydrochloric acids.   The slump in metals, coke ovens and textiles continues substantially unchanged.Fertilisers.The home market in sulphate of ammonia was very quiet during the first half of the month but improved towards the end.    a good deal of undercutting by sellers of both English and Continental material has been encountered.On the other hand, considerable movements of nitrochalk have taken place during the month, and orders for increasing quantities are being received daily from all parts of the United Kingdom.In the overseas markets, buyers are somewhat unsettled on account of price variations, though heavy forward bookings have been made in some directions..   Reports from New York indicate that, whilst prices for nitrate of soda are maintained, only a small amount of business is pas sing.Dye stuffs.The dyestuffs trade is still depressed, largely on account of the continued cotton strike, and the consumption of indigo is still on the decline.    On the other hand, the acetata silk trade appears to be showing some signs of revival and the rubber trade, judged by colour consumption, is comparatively good.    Certain branches of the paper trade are improving and longer hours are being worked, but the general tone remains dull.The dye makers have renewed their offer to the users to meet the foreign price when it is a fair and not a dumping price and this has been accepted by the lyestuffs Advisory Licensing Committee.    The makers have also made proposals which will considerably facilitate the importation of new products and these suggestions have also been accepted by the Licensing Committee.   The new procedure will, it is hoped meet all the objections which the users levelled against the continuation of the Dyestuffs net.Opal Tar Products.The present position is unsatisfactory, in the extreme, for considerable stocks continue to accumulate, while some areas have done no business at a working profit for some months.    Prices generally are unsatisfactory, and neither home nor export demand show promise of recovery in the near future.    Creosote and pitch on the latter market seem to have lost permanently their hitherto useful markets In America and Belgium respectively.Fine Chemicals.In the last quarter of each year, the fine chemical industry, particularly in so far as it covers medicinals, looks for a seasonal development in trade, and the gravity of the situation will be appreciated when it is observed that the last quarter of 1930 was for the fine chemical manufacturer by far the worst period of the year.
8,4So far as present business is oonoerned, export trade Is at the lowest ebb reached for some time j home business is somewhat better in a limited number of lines amongst medicinal products, for illness is more prevalent than many appreciate, but this applies to a very narrow field, and the general position is no better, and if anything, somewhat worse than hitherto.PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE; What was the cize of that Russian order?DR. CLAYTON: It Is a big order, it is one of the biggest users in Japan,    I could get you the actual figure.PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE: Can you help us on this point, because as you know it is a matter of some controversy.   Have you any information to show whether it is really based on a need for immediate cash or to what extent it is part of a campaign, a definite polioy?DR, CLAYTON: I am sure I can get you that figure. I only heard yesterday about this big order in Japan. I can get It and send it to you.PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADES    I should be grateful to see anything any section of industry has which would throw a light on the industrial side of the two points I have put because as you know they are much in controversy In public life,DR, CLAYTON: They are making the stuff at the works they etole from the sulphate people.   They pay no overhead charges on the production.   They start with that. They have no capital charges.PRESIDENT OF TEE BOARD OF TRADE:    On the other hand in whatever way they came by the property it seems difficult to think of any country going on giving goods away -DR. CLAYTON: I do not know whether they are paying any wages to the workers. In that way you get rid of a good deal of the cost,PRESIDENT OF TEE BOARD OF TRADE:    But after all people must be fed somehow.DR. CLAYTON: I suppose they are fed somehow but the unfortunate people who grow the foodstuffs are not being paid either. /PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:    It is an extra-ordinary situation.      I shall be glad of any information that can be given on those points,COAL.SIR WALTER RAINE: I propose to hand in my report&quot; but I should like to call your attention to one or two Items I have set down in it.      The first is in regard to the coal trade.       In Durham and Northumberland the coal trade excepting for the very best brands is very much*:&quot;See Appendix page 7s.
quieter than it has been for months,    I am going now particularly to refer to what is happening in regard to coking ooal.    What is taking place is no fault of the exporters because some of them have unfortunately high priced contracts which the collieries are naturally pressing them to take out, so much so that in many instances they are taking orders at 3d. to 4frd. below the minimum price fixed.      They are having to do&quot;that not only because they are pressed by the collieries and naturally so but in order to keep well established or old established connections.    Another interesting fact -as you know Durham and Northumberland have fixed prices -small coals in Northumberland are from 10/- to 10/6 according to the particular brand;    in Durham from 12/- to 12/6 according to brand.    They cannot get orders and they are heaping up stock at a very rapid rate,   Yorkshire on the other hand has been able to reduce its price for best washed smalls from 12/- down to as low as 8/6d.    It is quite true to say that so far as Yorkshire is concerned they are affected by the present position in Lancashire.There is another question in connection with the coal trade to which I referred in a previous report, namely, the possible effect of the quotas which have been established.    I pointed out to you on a previous occasion that it was possible,  and would probably happen, that owing to the action of the quota on the best qualities they would not be able to keep up their export trade and on Monday I received a copy of a letter from Copenhagen,  the letter is addressed to the Minister of Mines, pointing out of recent months they have had second qualities and other qualities than they desired pushed upon them and no doubt the imposition of the quota during the past six months has been largely responsible for that, and they point out in this letter that if they cannot get the particular brand of coal which they require and have others offered to them we must not as Britishers expect that the Danes are going to encourage the British coal trade in the way they have been asked to do.Dr. Clayton referred a few moments ago to Russia.    I have spoken about this on more than one occasion and I can assure you speaking from the Chamber of Commerce standpoint up and down the country they are really getting seriously alarmed about the position.    I do not know whether you happened to read the Report of the International Chamber at Paris at the beginning of December.    There were some very strong speeches made by Sir Arthur Balfour and Sir Felix Schuster.    I leave their speeches on one side, and refer to the speech made by the American representative who incidentally, is Vice-President of the International Chamber.    He pointed out the position very strongly and if you have not already read that speech I would recommend you to have a look at it.    At any^rate rhilst I am not for one moment supporting many of the alarmist articles which are appearing in the Press from day to day I do think there must be a great deal of truth In these statements.    I think the time has come when incontrovertible proof as to how far these statements are true should be obtained and if there is some measure of truth in the statements something ought to be done because the position as Dr.. Clayton has given you one Illustration is really very serious indeed and people are really, end I think rightly so, getting alarmed and they want to know the truth about the matter.
U VRAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:    I am afraid, Sir, I have nothing that is cheerful to say as far as the railways are concerned at the present moment.   This time last year we were benefitting to some extent, and our receipts were showing an Improvement on the preceding year, in the current year our receipts, our carryings generally, are going down very rapidly on last year&apos;s figures and a s far as one can see at present the decline is accelerating rather than slacking off.    If I may give first of all the position as regards our receipts.   Taking it in the three main divisions, passenger receipts which in November were going down by 4^%9 in December went down by 5? and in January by 5t^. . Merchandise, that is all classes of goods traffic, leaving aside only coal and ooke, went down by lli$ in November, by 10t% in December and Is now going down at the rate of 15f.%.   Coal and coke, the figures are very much affected there by the Coal Strike in Wales.   They snowed 3t$ decrease In November, a quarter per,cent, decrease only In December and In the month of January 7f$.   If you take tonnages the position is very much the same, an accelerated falling off in the tonnage carried by the railways.   Taking the month of January the figures for the different individual companies were, the London and North Eastern - which may be taken as representing the eastern side of the country principally - shows a decrease in merchandise of 12%&apos;- in tonnagej London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which of course is much affected by the position of affairs in Lancashire, shows a decrease of 19;  in tonnage, both very heavy declines indeed.   The figures I have just given cover the higher classes of merchandise. If you go to the heavier classes, the figures are even worse.   The London and North Eastern Railway shows a decline of 17-^.C and the London, Midland and Scottish a decline of 27.f.   In coal and coke the position Is relatively not so bad.   There the London and North Eastern and the London, Midland and Scottish show very much the same result, both about 7^4&apos;.   The great Western figures I have not given because they are affected very largely by the position in South Wales, but their decline in merchandise Is even heavier than those of the London and North Eastern and the London, Midland and Scottish. Those are the main figures, I cannot divide them into individual commodities for the month of January but they show that so far as carryings by rail are a test of the business done by the country it Is falling off by anything between 10  and 15$(At this stage the President of the Board of Trade left the meeting and Mr. Walter Smith took the Chair).SIR GUY GRAHET:    It is very depressing to hear Sir Ralph but I take it compared with other countries we are not so badly off, are we?SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD: I have no Information as to the carryings of other countries. In America I think the falling off is distinotly worse than here.SIR GUY GRAHET:    Is it not the fact that in America the net reoeipts for the first eleven months of last year, that is up to December of last year, are down 30^?
SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:    I think that is the case.SIR GUY GRANET:   And I think the German railways are definitely worse than us.    It does not do us much good, on the other hand it is no use getting too depressed.SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:    I think that is true.MR. WALTER SMITH:    It rather emphasises the world aspect of the problem.    It does not help us much.SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:.  It does not help us much, no. The railways always follow behind the trade movement in these things.   We feel the depression last and the improvement last. It is not until the traffic is actually produced or manufactured that we begin to carry it.   At the same time while the goods are being sent we carry them although they may have been manufactured for some time.WOOL.ALDBRiviAH T IT TE RI KG T 0 K:    During the first half of January the wool market was very depressed.    This was mainly due to the slump in the Australian Exchange which fell from  108.10.0 to  130 per  100 sterling.   The London sales opened with a decline of from 15;t to 20/ compared with December which brought wool values as a whole to the lowest point on record for over a century.   Confidence seemed to be completely destroyed but there was a remarkable change in the second week oi the sales.    Prices rose sharply, there was a much improved demand and when the sales closed last Saturday the bulk of the fall had been recovered especially in fine wools.At Bradford the upward turn brought out a substantial amount of business in Merino tops and a smaller amount in cross-bred tops.    Botany spinners booked sufficient orders to ensure a return to something like the activity which prevailed three months ago.   Cross-bred spinners though a little better placed than they have been, are still very much under employed. The worsted manufacturing section is still doing better than the woollen section and it looks as if there will be the normal seasonal expansion during the next month or so.Bo far as one can gather there has not been a great deal of speculative buying on the part of the industry itself.    On the other hand large quantities of wool have been bought in Australia by firms outside the trade as a means of bringing home their money.   This has given a fictitious appearance of activity in Australia,    The wool will have to be re-sold on this side sooner or later.    Ho one knows exactly how much wool has boon bought in this way, where it is stored, and when and where it will be put on to the market.    I do not know whether there is any means of arriving at that information. Possibly the dock authorities might know if wool is being stored in unusual places.    If it is stored in London with the regular warehouse keepers then the periodical returns which are issued will show what accumulation there is.
o 6Perhaps the banks have some knowledge as to the extent of the purchases by firms outside the trade and perhaps the Board of Trade may enlighten us upon the matter if it is at all possible because it is a very uncertain factor in the industry and will certainly prevent a thorough restoration of confidence and i am sure the trade as a whole will welcome any information to be obtained.There seems to be a fairly general belief that fine wool values have reached the bottom even though there may be some temporary relapse from present prices.    If this is so, there should be greater willingness to buy throughout the trade which will help to give a fillip to employment. The wool textile industry is generally regarded as a good barometer of trade conditions, and I hope on this occasion it will prove so.    Negotiations are in progress in the dyeing and finishing industry with regard to a request by the employers for a reduction of 15;;  in wage rates.    Hints are also being thrown out that the woollen and worsted employers are considering a fresh move towards lower wages.MR. WALTER SMITH:    In regard to the point you mentioned about the purchase of wool, have you any information as to whether the wool is in this country or abroad?ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:    I imagine it is in this country. a gentlemen on the train last night said he was getting his debts paid in this country by the transference of wool supplies from Australia though he was an  -ustralian. tf-e was meeting his payments on this side by se, ling wool through the wool brokers on his behalf.MR. WALTER SMITH:    That means that Australia is sending wool over here instead of cash?ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:    Undiluted barter.    It is a very serious matter the point I am putting.    It is the irregular means of selling the wool which will have a very serious effect upon wool prices.    If the wool is not coming through the recognised channels, through the recognised sales, if it is sold indiscriminately there will be no confidence.SIR FREDERICK YOUHG:    I think, although it has been very difficult to arrive at these figures, I have heard it . said that the total was about 50,000 bales.   That is the estimate I have had in fairly well informed quarters, but it is merely an estimate and very difficult to arrive at. This wool is bought in many oases In relatively small quantities by commercial trading people in Australia who want London money.   They buy a parcel of wool, send it home and use the money for purchasing here because they cannot get London money under the ration system which is prevailing.    It is very difficult indeed to arrive at the amount of the sales of wool.   Those engaged in wool on the Australian wool side are much concerned about it because we realise it is a disturbing factor here, because if people are not in the ordinary way selling for a profit on purchase, it is a way of selling to get the money in London.MR. WALTER SMITH:   We will consider the point as to whether it is not possible to get the information though If as stated it is being bought In small quantities and outside the regular trade It may be difficult.
ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:   There was a rumour that three large companies including a well known motoring company and a large oil company were responsible for bringing it over in substantial quantities.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG:    I understood the oil company was working in conjunction with wool buyers in the exchange of commodities.SIR GUY GRANET;    Surely with the depreciated currency that is bound to happen.   That is going on every day.SIR ERNEST GLDVER:    Is it not in some cases the only way in getting the money over from Australia?MR. WALTER SMITH:    At a meeting the other day Sir William Morris said that the difficulty was to get any payment from that end and I think it was suggested other methods might have to &quot;fae resorted to to get over the difficulty.   That was some time ago,     I suppose that is materialising now,SIR WALTER RaINE:    It was going on some time ago by the regular wool brokers.   I told Sir William Morris I could give the name of the person privately who was prepared to do that in the ordinary way of business, but he was a regular- wool broker.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.MR. VARLEY:    In the Co-operative Movement on this side of the Border our cash receipts are down on twelve months ago, but the quantity of goods, the weight of goods delivered, is considerably up in all the main commodities, sugar, butter, flour, cheese, bacon and the principal things.    Our weights are up but our money values are down, and so far as the retail and wholesale prices are concerned attention has been drawn in this committee to the disparity between the two, but now they seem to have got -about equal to each other.    Retail prices of course must come down rather slower than the wholesale prices and go up in the same way rather slower. I could give you the percentages but I will not trouble you with them, they are about the same in the principal - commodities.    So far as butter Is concerned something was said a month ago about the peculiarity of the requirements of the north and the south.    I have some figures here, that in the Manchester district, and in Lancashire and Yorkshire and many of the principal towns In the Midlands our butter trade is something like 30,000 tons for the year all kinds.   The Australian and New Zealand have an increase of 815 tons on the half year and then it only represents 1,000 tons, so there is about 30 times more fanish than Australian and New Zealand as far as the north is concerned.   The prices are now going more in accord with pre-reduction days and there is not the diiference that there was in New Zealand and Australian and Danish as there was three months ago.    Sugar is very unsatisfactory;
the market has gone down twice and gone up once during the past month and everybody seems to he waiting for the result of the restrictive agreements, if ever they come, which are being sought by the Cuban and Javanese and the other producers of sugar including the -European.The tea market,  the market has been much stronger during the month though there has been little change in quotations. The market is firm.     Auction sales closed down for the usual period of Christmas and on resumption on January 5th the market remained fairly steady and all descriptions met with a fairly good demand at low quotations.     As far as bacon and hams are concerned the abnormally low prices continue to operate and the consumptive demand is good - I am speaking of Denmark - and we are experiencing a ready clearance.     The feeling in the trade is that though prices are not likely to advance they will remain at their present level for some time to come.     The bottom seems to have been knocked out of the imported meat trade.     Potatoes are higher than they were a year ago.      There was a big slump about a year ago, but they advanced during January and I think they are the only thing that is higher now than a year ago and it is expected that the price will keep up during the season.As far as wheat is concerned I will content myself with saying there has been little change during the month taking the market as a whole.     The crop in Australia is being shipped and prices have had to fall in order to effect sales. Dry goods, boots, furnishing, are slack on account of the lack of employment especially in the cotton and in the coal trade. There is one little item I think might interest you,     We have had an order for Australian butter from Prague,     The order was for  565 but it is interesting to see that Australian butter is getting into Central europe.At the beginning of the year in January 1930 the funds in our banking department were  43,645,000, in January 1931  55,570,000, an increase of  11,937,585.      I will hand in the figures es to how it has arisen.i!Something has been said about Russian business, and as I have told you before in our bank we are doing a fair trade with Russia in one way or another.     Grain and other goods shipped from Russia, trade credits allowed on general goods supplied to Russia and during the twelve months ending 10th January 1931 the amount advanced has been  18,903,271 sterling, and the repayments have been  18,863,976.      I do not know whether that will answer some of the questions that some of our friends have put.      I will leave the figure as it stands.I do not know if I have told you that in Australia we have been for some years now financing the wheat crop of Western Australia.     During last year-we advanced  2,800,000 odd.     During the same period we received in repayment  5,281,454,     The difference in the amount is accounted for by the fact that the wheat season begins on the 1st July and consequently there was a larger amount owing in January onSee Appendix p, 82
o- JLlast year&apos;s crop and that has been repaid during the year. It might interest you to know that we had under consideration last week the question of financing the growing crop in Australia hut yesterday we received a wire from our Australian friends stating that the Government is putting forward an internal loan of  6,000,000,  2,000,000 of which have to go to Western Australia for the purpose of financing their wheat.So far as New Zealand produce is concerned, during the year ended October 31 last we have advanced on butter  395,000, on cheese  511,000 and on meat  402,000.     Then I have sometimes given the figures of the Russian Grain Exporters&apos; Association.     From the 1st July up to the present time in the different kinds of grain there have been 1,291,626 tons brought into this country.      73.53$ or 947,756 tons of which are wheat,  the others are the different kinds of grain.MR. VALTER SMITH:   Can you tell us whether your Society is buying herrings and selling them to Russia at all?MR. VARLEY:   Yes, not in such large quantities as they were sold before.     You might call them large quantities -MR. WALTER SMITH:    But not so large as in former years?MR. VARL.Y:   No, I do not think so.     There are some going from this side, but I hear that they are also getting some from Iceland.MR. WALTER SMITH:   You say there is an increase in weight of trade, is that due to increased membership or to lower values?MR. VARL-1Y:    I think perhaps it is due to both.OO-OPERATIVS TRADE IN SCOTLAND.MR. CAIRNS:   While a few of the departments and factories are steadily maintaining the usual flow of business the trade as a whole exhibits a downward tendency and a large majority of the units are being subjected to a lessening turnover which is in excess of the amount which can be assigned to a mere fall in value.     The factories employ an average number of 6,953 persons, and among those engaged in the textile, the leather and the furnishing industries spells of short time are of frequent occurrence.     The value of the production for 1930 was  5,793,827 while for 1929 the value was  6,152,730, about  400,000 less than for 1929,     Prior to last year the furniture factory had a long run of expanding trade of which a large part was imputed to the needs created by the Municipal Housing Schemes and while these still continue in a measure the demand has fallen off for the good class of home made furniture.     We observe an increasing demand for imported furniture of a cheaper class probably stimulated by a decline
C-9in the purchasing power of the members owing to the scarcity of employment.The experience of our tannery is that all types of hides used by British firms are still moving towards lower prices and last month the average price of hides was 23% lower than that for the corresponding month of 1930.      In the same period the average price of materials used in the process of tanning fell to the extent of 12%,     The jute factory after a disastrous year in results during 1930 while it is still far from prosperous has begun the year with somewhat enhanced prospects.     For a considerable time life has been crushed out of the market by the burden of large stocks, but now the Calcutta Jute Mills Association seems to realise the damaging effect of this state of things and proposes to curtail production both by working shorter hours and by closing down a proportion of the machinery.The mill for the making of wrapping paper is fully employed.     There is some curiosity in the trade regarding the action of the foreign mills in the matter of prices when the safeguarding duty lapses in April.     Latterly they have reduced the prices until with the addition of the duty they have reached a competitive level with those of the home mills.     The question is will they take advantage of the abolition of the duty to raise their prices.On the distributive side of the business the chief features of the drapery and furnishing trades continue to be declining and low prices.     These generally are lower than they have been since 1914.      In the principal articles of food there was no material change during the month either in supply or demand.     The sugar market is dull and lifeless, the supply is plentiful, buying restricted to immediate needs and prices showing a downward tendency.     Butter has displaj^ed considerable elasticity in the demand for it and the low prices have had the effect of creating a large increase of consumption,Russian wheat of which supplies are plentiful is not altogether suitable for Scotch bread and in consequence millers have been buying more freely of Canadian to impart strength to the mixture of wheat in their flour.     Mainly as the result of this procedure local quotations for Canadian have recently advanced l/9d. per quarter.     Home wheat is very low in price and has fallen about 2/- per quarter in the course of the month. Killers are using very little of it as the quality is generally inferior for milling purposes.     Very few samples of very good Scotch wheat have been presented in the market this season.MR. WALTER SMITH:    Is the Russian wheat on the soft side?MR. CAIRNS:    On the soft side, for Scottish bread.MR. BENTON JONES:    Is there any intimation as to whether English wheat generally is unsuitable or not so suitable for milling,  that is, last year&apos;s crop of English wheat, because English wheat also has obtained record lov prices.MR. CAIRNS s    In a general way the harvesting weather was bad last year, especially in Scotland.      I think relatively English wheat is better in that respect than Scottish wheat, but we use a small quantity of English wheat, not very much;    it is used to give flavour to the bread but there is not much strength in English wheat.
MR. WALTER SMITH:    I should think it would he considered a had harvest for wheat last year although of course wheat improves in the stack.       It may recover from bad harvesting conditions to some extent by hardening in the stack.MR. CAIRNS:    Yes.BUILDING.MR. BARRON:    The building industry is,  in common with all other industries, going through a very serious depression at the moment.    The latest figures of unemployment show that there are 188,000 building trade operatives unemployed.    Right throughout last year,  in contradistinction to the usual,  there was never a lesser number of unemployed than 12-&amp; in May and June and it has gone on until in December the percentage is something like 22,7.    The only bright spot in it is that in the figures given by 146 representative   authorities there seems to be a progressive increase in plans passed for new building.    Last year, taking the incomplete year of 1930,  it is calculated that there will be 75 million and that is a considerable increase on the year before and also a considerable increase on the six or seven years prior to that,      Of course the result of those plans being passed will not mean actual constructive work yet to any great extent, but it may be felt in the coming year.In common with many other industries there has been an adjustment of wages recently, a reduction of wages. They are taking their share in the economies we are hearing something about this morning.    The extent of their contributions on the 1st February was -g-d per hour or 2/-per week  80,000 per week for the total of the workers in the industry,  or something over  4 million per year in reduced wages and also unfortunately in r educed expenditure which is reflected by our friend from the Co-operative movement.    The total wage reductions that have taken place in the building industry since 1920 are something like lOd. per hour, which is a considerable sum.    I have not figures dealing with the reduction in the cost of building materials but while I know there has been a considerable reduction I am quite satisfied that there has not been the same relative reduction in the price of building materials as there has been in the wages of the operatives in the industry,  thereby of course, making it very difficult to operate reductions of wages amongst bodies of work people.    The fact that the industry is going through such a period of depression has made it also unfortunately a period of unrest in the industry and&apos; at the moment notice has been      given to terminate a national agreement which has been running for something like ten years.    That agreement expires at the end of March, but I am quite sure that with the usual good sense which has prevailed in the building industry there will be an arrangement come to before that period, to carry on in the usual way.I have some figures which I will hand in *:.    In regard to shipbuilding in which I am also interested-, matters are so bad that I shall leave Sir &quot;Irnest Glover to report because he can paint a blacker picture than even I can do with regard to that industry.&apos;* See appendix page 29
MR. WALTER SMITH:    That 188,000 are they a balanced figure, or is it in certain sections of the trade?MR. BAHRON:    Taking them in the different crafts, they are relatively the same.    There are some crafts such as painters and labourers, which have always a higher percentage, but the other crafts are pretty muoh alike.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. POLLETT HOLT t I will hand in a memorandum, the first one I have compiled&apos;&apos;.      I recognise that it is far too general and does not deal sufficiently with the trade position, but, as the question of Russia has been raised and in view of its great importance to us all perhaps you would allow me to read just a small portion of this memorandum because it deals with that aspect of the question that may possibly have escaped notice.    &quot;Great Britain has a greater stake in Argentina than in any other part of the world outside the British Empire.    In the railways alone we have some  300 million sterling invested and these railways help to support us with their earnings, by considerable coal shipments from Great Britain and large orders placed for rolling stock and other supplies.    Argentina relies largely on agricultural products for her livelihood.    If, therefore,  cereals produced in Russia without any capital charge on the land cn which they are grown,  are placed on the market at the price at which similar products cannot be grown in -Argentina,  the latter working under the capitalist system will be ruined and the British railways also.    It is suggested that the possibility of this national loss of  300 million sterling should be taken into account now that the debits and credits of the present position and outlook are under consideration&quot;.    That is the salient point that I endeavoured to bring out in the memorandum.    It occurs to me that that is a point which may possibly have escaped notice.COAL.MR. MITCHELL:    as regards the coal trade in Scotland there is no change in the situation.    No further agreement has been made as regards wages yet.      The temporary agreement goes on to the end of February.      Discussions have continued.    There is a good deal of complaint about the working ef quotas, some collieries suffering somewhat seriously from the restriction of output.    The details of the Marketing Scheme are not yet adjusted and great difficulty is found in making a scheme to meet the requirements of the .^ot which will be effective,    a group of companies owning a number of collieries have gone into liquidation with heavy liabilities.    In December there was a margin of profit shown in the return, due partly to the shortage caused by the week&apos;s strike at the beginning of the month,  and partly to the winter demands.* See Appendix page 56
The outputs have been:-week to January 10........... 639,700 tons.&quot;      &quot;        &quot;        17  ----.----.  619,900    &quot;&quot;      11        ,f        24 ..........   667,200    &quot;For the corresponding week to 24th January last year the output was 735,800,  a reduction being shown for this year of nearly 10?*.      The reduction will be more for other weeks,The shipments to 7th February were 197,517 tons compared with 245,365 for the corresponding week of last year.    Shipments for the year to 6th February show a reduction of 266,049 tons.There has been a fair demand for round coal locally but the demand   for small coals both locally and for shipment is very poor and prices are being reduced and are lower than last year.      The prospects for shipment generally are very bad,        Poland is selling at low prices.The coke market is very depressed and prices very low. Generally,  the outlook is very serious.IRON AMD STEEL.Pig Iron - there are new ten furnaces in blast, three damped down for a period having resumed work and two having been blown in by a maker to make up stocks which were depleted.      The production in December was 15,500 tons as compared with 55,800 tons in December 1929. The imports into Scotland in December were 17,627 tons, 11,965 of this quantity being foundry largely from Belgium, and 5,562 being basic from India.        English Pig Iron is now quite uncompetitive in price.      There is no improvement in the position generally.Steel - the production in December was 53,000 tons compared with 121,800 tons In December 1929 and with 63,500 tons in November 1930.    The position is very unsatisfactory. although one steel works was closed towards the end of last year,   the remaining works are working intermittently with low weekly outputs.    No shipbuilding orders are being placed,The scrap position remains very much as per the last few weeks.        The supply is plentiful and prices easy. The imports into Scotland in December were 4,106 tons and the exports 3,228 tons.    Some       exports are at relatively high prices and must be special material.Imports of iron and steel continue heavy;    the total steel&quot;into Scotland in December was 38,287 tons,  the total of iron and steel being 55,809 tons.The tube trade shows no improvement.      The export to Australia continues small and there is difficulty in getting remittances home, which may interfere seriously with the trade in future.
*y 0COAL.ICR. BENT ON JONES t   During the month of January the production of coal has been interfered with &quot;by the South Wales strike the effect of which was to decrease production by about 800,000 tons of coal per week.     The average production of coal for the 13 weeks from November 1st to January 24th was 4,609,000 tons as compared with 5,191,000 tons for the corresponding period last year, an average decrease of half a million tons per week. The number at present employed in the industry for the week ending January 24th was 882,000 which compares with 884,000, the average for the 13 weeks ending on the same date, January 24th, and compares with 946,300 for the corresponding period last year.     Unemployment for the month of December was 19.7 per cent as compared with 21.1 per cent in November and an average of 20.5 per cent in 1930.     The 19.7 per cent in December 1930 compares with 14.6 per cent in December 1929.     The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in December was 4,009,000 tons as compared with 5,865,000 tons in November, a small increase, and as compared with 4,804,000 in December 1929, a decrease of 800,000 tons.     The average price f.o.b. in December was 16/Id as compared with 16/2d in November.     The exports to Scandinavia in December were 389,000 tons as compared with a monthly average in 1913 of 825,000 tons, and a monthly average in 1929 of 498,000 tons.     Exports to Germany in December were 411,000 tons as compared with a monthly average in 1913 of 746,000 tons.      On the other hand exports to Belgium and the Netherlands in December were 528,000 tons as compared with an average in 1913 of 337,000 tons.     The exports by sea from Poland show a small increase compared with November, the figures being December 813,000 tons and November 751,000 tons..      I will hand in a summary containing some statistics and a few interesting features in connection with the British coal industry in 1930.*   I would just like to read from it this concluding paragraph.     Leading up to this paragraph I give various statistics showing the difference in costs of coal in European countries as compared with Great Britain, and the facilities for exporting coal from these countries.      The concluding paragraph reads as follows:-    &quot;These and other measures taken by foreign competitors of this country together with the increase in costs involved in the readjustment of hours in Great Britain have considerably weakened the competitive power of the British industry at a time when industrial depression has rendered the markets more acute and revived the discussion of international agreements&quot;.COTTON.MR. LENNOX LEE:    The conditions in the cotton trade have been overshadowed by the dispute which has arisen over the &quot;more looms to a weaver system&quot;.     Notwithstanding this, however, raw cotton prices have become distinctly harder, it the beginning of the month, March futures of American cotton at Liverpool stood at 5.23d.   whilst the closing quotations on February 3rd shpwed an advance of 30 points from that level.     In the case of Egyptian Sakellaridis March futures began the year at Liverpool at 7.25d.and they* See Appendix Page   62.
are now standing fully 100 points higher than they did a month ago.As regards the conditions in the principal markets business with India has remained poor.     The Boycott continues with unabated zeal and the closing of the Round Tsble Conference,  followed by the release of Gandhi, appears to have given strength to the movement, particularly in Bombay where picketing has been intensified,t     Merchants in Bombay are reported to consider it not worth their while, under present conditions,    to attend regularly at their places of business and, in consequence, many close their shops for extended periods.The difficulties created by the alteration of the Chinese Settlement Date have largely been overcome although the silver question has tended to worsen and, with the continued fall in exchange, dealers in China have shown increased disinclination to book new business.     The Russians are reported to be making a further attempt to capture this market in prints, but, as deliveries are made only for cash they have met with no success.Exchange difficulties have hampered business with the Argentine and Brazil.The remainder of my report is general and I will hand it in.*AUSTRALIAN TRADE.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG i    I am handing in a very short report on the Australian position.8^     I may say just generally that as regards practically all exported commodities the season shows an increase in volume in almost every item to date but, of course,  the abnormally low prices ruling are affecting very seriously the volume of money realised.As regards the December figures for imports into Australia,  which have a great bearing on the trade with this country, unfortunately the imports are very much reduced from that point of view, although it is necessary.     The December figures for imports are  5,178,000, showing a decrease of practically the same amount over last year, that is the figure   was practically halved in December. For the six months the total imports are  38,000,000 showing a decrease of  36,000,000 compared with the previous year. That is an indication of the position,  largely   an exchange position,  and it is an Indication of the effect the position in Australia is having upon the trade which she ?;ould otherwise be carrying on with this country.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR CYRIL HURCOldB:      I have to say that our railway figures only bring out the same results as those* See Appendix Page 68. t See Page 25 below. See Appendix Page 84.
Q Qgiven by Sir Ralph Wedgwood because they are based on the same material and I will not repeat them but I will hand in our usual statement&apos;;-.     I have taken out also the actual reduction in tonnage for the traffic carried by the railways during the first 11 months of last year and it amounts to over 25%- million tons which shows the extent of the decrease in carryings, of which only 13 million tons was- in coal, coke and patent fuel and 5-5- million tons was accounted for by iron ore,iron and steel and pig iron together.    With the percentage decrease in receipts being greater in the first five weeks of this year than last it does not look as If there will be any groat pick-up on those figures unless things improve.as regards the number of motor vehicles registered for the first time in December,  the latest month for which figures are available, they show an increase under every head;    as compared with December last year there were 1,820 more vehicles registered for the first time in December 1930 than in December 1929, and of that 1,300 odd nearly 1,400 were ordinary motor cars and 305 goods vehicles, lorries and things of that sort, and motor cycles showed an increase of 430 as compared with the previous year.SIR RaLPH WEDGWOOD:    When you-say there are 1,820 more vehicles, what doe3 that represent on a percentage?SIR CYRIL HURCOkB:    fhe rate of increase in the registration of new vehicles is 10^ over last year. It is theincrease in vehicles first registered in the month, as Ithink I explained before, we do not know where those vehiclescome from, how many of them are manufactured in this country or how many of them are imported.     All we can do is to give the figures.      Sir George Beharrell may be able to analyse them further than I can,HE. MITCHELL:    Does that figure take into account the number of vehicles which were taken off the register?SIR CYRIL HUROOIIB:   No, that is the number of vehicles registered for the first time,iilR. MITCHELL:    as against that there will be a number taken off the register.SIR CYRIL HUROOMB:    Yes, there will be some, but we cannot give you that figure.MR. WALTER SMITH:    You would not know that until January.-SIR CYRIL HURCOkB:    We do not-know that at all we cannot track them through.MR. VARLEY:    Would that include both heavy lorries and pleasure vehicles?SIR CYRIL HURCO^B:    Yes.    I do not know that you should*See Appendix page   58. -17-
attach too much importance to one month&apos;s figures.     They do not give a complete analysis, hut to any one who is interested in looking at the growth of these vehicles, I may say that we have just published a census of vehicles with licences current in the Quarter ending 50th September,     That is an annual return, so that if you want to see the growth in the number of motor vehicles of each class and description you will find It in that annual return and you can compare it for some years back.IRON AND STEEL.MR. WALMSLEYs    I am afraid there is no improvement to report although from some of the figures which I will give you in a minute you might think we had had a slight improvement.In regard to pig iron, there was a decline in the production which was foreseen, to 337,000 tons for the month, that is 4,500 tons less than December, I am sneaking of the January figures.     Fortunately nine blast furnaces resumed operation in January and only two went out of blast, giving a gain of seven furnaces in operation.     There has been a reduction in the price of steel and pig iron of 5/- a ton at the beginning of January which we hope will have some effect in curtailing the imports of Continental or foreign iron generally in that particular district, but, as Mr. Mitchell said, in Scotland British pig iron is non-competitive with either Continental or Indian.SIR GUY GRANET: why is that, is it because the cost of production is greater, or because the foreigner is exporting under cost price?MR. WALMSLEY:    Both I think.   We certainly cannot produce as cheaply with a wages rate on the Continent of about 503 of our own and I believe it is quite true that some of the iron which is coming from the Continent is being sold at a price which is probably below cost of production.    So far as the Indian iron is concerned, I suppose they have the lowest furnace oost in the world.     They have exceptionally good supplies of ore which are obtained at a very low labour cost. They have very excellent -furnaces and I believe their furnace cost is the lowest in the world to-day.    They are getting very low freights in the present state of the shipping market and it enables them to deliver here, certainly I think in their case, without incurring any loss at a good deal less than our actual cost of production.In regard to steel there waB an Improvement in production, which was only natural, because December was interfered with by the holidays.     The ingot production was about 400,000 tons, or 53,000 tons more than in December, but unfortunately the tonnage on the order books shows a slight decrease.   Imports of iron and steel together declined from 285,000 tons to 221,800 tons.   Exports also declined slightly,-from 169,500 tons to 167,400 tons so that imports again largely exceeded exports.
Reports from the districts indicate no improvement at all and in the North East coast shipbuilding seems to be practically dead.    Plate mills in that district are only able to work two or three days a week.    In Scotland there is nothing better to report generally.   The Clyde shipbuilding yards are rapidly working off their orders on hand.    It is very difficult to see what the steel makers in Scotland are going to do during the next few months.    The general opinion there seems to be that there is no improvement in sight for some considerable time.Continental prices of-steel have fallen again and in some cases they are down to the record low levels of November last.    Export trade is very dull, but there was a fairly good order for rails placed for South Africa a few weeks ago. Canada remains a fairly active market, and it is hoped that the Trade Mission which is to visit this Dominion at an early date will have a beneficial effect on trade.    There has &quot;been no alteration in the official price of British steel but last month it was decided to make an increase in the rebate which was allowed to consumers who confine their purchases to steel of British manufacture.    This in effect, of course, is a reduction in the cost to the large majority of the consumers of steel in this country.I would like to support the special note that Mr.Follett Holt made about the Argentine.    We are feeling very severely in this country the lack of orders for rails from that country. We have always had a very large share of the steel rails used there, naturally I suppose because they are British companies, but it is a long time now since any order worth speaking of was placed for the Argentine and we are feeling that loss very severely in our rail mills.      Our rail mills I think are work-ing a little bit better at the moment, partly on account of the South African order and partly because the British railways have been ordering some of their requirements for relaying for this year.    It may be of interest to know that the decline in the production of steel ingots during 1930 as compared with 19 29 has been much more marked in the United Kingdom and in Germany than in competing Continental countries.    France did best;    in 1929 she produced 9,699,000 tons and in 1930 she produced 9,402,000, hardly any reduction at all.    In this country we dropped from 9,640,000 to 7,300,000.    The other figures I will hand in-::-.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG;    Is there any evidence that Argentine rail requirements are being ordered from other quarters;    you say they have not yet appeared.MR.  wALMSLEY:    No,, the trouble is that they are not placing them.MR. WALTER SMITH:    Do we supply them normally?   Are their requirements normally met from this country?MR. WALMSLEY:    Yes, almost entirely, with the exception of the State railways.     The State railways have placed some two or three orders to America or on the Continent, but all the British owned railways have always placed their orders in this country.4&apos;&apos;S?e    App. p.84.
MR. FOLLETT HOLT:    The railways there are practically all British, all the &quot;big companies are British and 90% of the total mileage of the country is British.IRON AND STEEL.MR. CHADWICK:    The position in regard to the iron and steel trade is having such an effect on the production of castings that you can hardly expect there is anything but a doleful story concerning this class of trade.     I think, if anything, from&apos; the end of December to the. end of January the position has got worse.With regard to the foundry industry generally,  taking it back to January 1930,  the figures for unemployment at that time were 10.1 per cent.     At the end of January 1931 they stood at 30%.     That will give you some indication of the position existing in this class of trade.      It might be interesting to know - I have a statement here which I will put in* - that out of the furnaces working at the present time 39 are smelting for foundries and steel forgings and, it rather appals me to hear the statements made with regard to the importation of Belgian pig iron into Scotland.      If that is the position in Scotland it must be equally bad in England, because there is a greater weight of castings produced in England than in Scotland.     We have been making a rough analysis of the position with regard to the foundries in the country at the present time and it has revealed a startling state of affairs.      It appears there are something like 7,000 foundries in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and there are some 3,700 founders, that is.  owners of foundries,, The analysis shows that there are 150 steel foundries;    300 light alloy foundries;    3,000 non-ferrous foundries, and 3,000 iron foundries, including 190 dealing with malleable iron.     This,  in our opinion, has a tendency to increase the cost of production of castings because we find,  in a great number of these - you will note the figures of 7,000 foundries and 3,700 founders - we find that the founding is made ancillary to other industries, engineering shops and the like, and is not given the special attention it ought to have as regards cost of production.     We find that where founders such as Sir Robert Hadfield of Sheffield or Edgar Aliens are concerned,  they are far and away in advance of foundries which are not given the thought that ought to be given to them, that is to say, foundries connected with engineering shops and so on.     They are much more up to date; there is a cheaper cost of production as a result of their being brought up to date.     There is a great number of small foundries that could be very well crushed out because here again there is a great increase of cost of production talcing place as a result of not being brought up to date.      I do not want to go too far into this matter at this stage.     The statement I am handing in shows the position with respect to the district rate of unemployment.      I might also state,* See Appendix page 35
f l\ 9 x \j 4*that here again the representatives of the Employers Federation and the Trade Unions, representing all the engineering and foundry trades of Great Britain, have been drawn together with the end in view of seeing whether it is possible to arrive at some solution by way of working out something to extricate the industry from its present perilous position.     How far that is going to carry us one cannot say at this stage, but certain it is that the employers are pressing for a revision of almost every agreement they have made since 1898 with the Unions.     That is, with regard to the questions such as overtime rates, and the system of payment by results and even to the extent of asking for an increase in hours.MR. WALTER SMITH:    Was this large number of foundries of which you speak brought into existence very largely to cater for what might be termed special lines which have now disappeared with the tendency for more mass production, but they still go on?      Is that the explanation of them?MR. CHADwTCK:    Our information is that there are about 50 foundries fall out of existence bi-annually and about 25 new ones start, but a great number of those are made up in all sorts of ramshackle quarters.     Their being crushed out would do no harm to the trade in this country and, not from a foundry point of view at any rate.     You will get two or three men starting a foundry in one place.     Those people cannot compete in the production of castings.MR. WALMSLSY:   May I ask whether there are any figures regarding the import of castings in competition with all these 7,000 foundries Mr. Chadwick mentions?MR. CHADWICK.   No, we have no figures with regard to the imports of castings&apos;:&apos;, as far as we are concerned,.     It might be stated that we have information with respect to Germany, to the extent of 2,000 foundries in Germany, and they have 1,500 foundries in France.MR. WALTER SMITH;   Would that be related to a bigger production?     I just forget for the moment what would be the production in those countries relative to our own production, I think their production is larger, is it not?MR. CHABwICK:    Germany will be larger.      I would not like to say the same concerning France,.      I do not think they have reached the same standard in the production of castings in France.MR. BENTON JONES: Do not these small foundries supply very largely the local needs; are they not small foundries which start in a town and supply a local- demand,MR, CHADWICK:    It just depends what the local demand is.MR. BENTON J0N3S:    That is the reason why it springs up because there is the trade in the particular town.* Figures of the imports of castings in the rough of iron and steel are given in the Trade Accounts and amounted in 1930 to 14,788 tons valued at  348,786.
mR. alTCiiELL:    I think very often these comparatively small foundries are able to compete with the larger ones. They nave very small standing charges.wiR. CILhDWICK:    We do not find that to be the case unless they are lessening the standard to a very large extent in a given area, both with regard to conditions and also with respect to the price of labour.SHIPPING aHD SHIPBUILDING.SIR ERNEST GLOVER:    I have no improvement to report in shipping.    As a matter of fact the index number for January is one point down on December, but the general condition continues almost unchanged in all directions. With regard to cargo outwards, after the South Wales strike was finished chartering was resumed, but rates of freights are so low tnat in the long trades a great many steamers are going in ballast rather than take the outward freight as it practically represents no profit.   With regard to the general cargo trade both outwards and homewards Mr. Lennox Lee and Sir Frederick Young have indicated what the condition is with regard to the position of importers in India, Australia, and the argentine.   The boycott is still continuing in India and the exchange troubles in Australia and the Argentine, so that the general cargo trade naturally has suffered from the lack of exports to those countries.With regard to grain generally, so far as I can understand it the Russian position is that, they had large stores of grain in this country which have been pretty well disposed of.   There have been some shipments from Russia -but on nothing like the same scale as they were assuming in the last hair&apos; of last year.    Probably as a result of this there has been a very considerable shipment from the Argentine and also a fair amount of shipping from Australia,   No doubt both in the Argentine and in Australia, the exchange position, whilst it interfered with the imports, has helped the exports and there is some indication during the last few days that Canada is coming back into the market and shipping some wheat,We cannot get away from Russia, it stares us -in the face all the time.There is rather a new development, a considerable shipment of sugar from Russia to India.   We are rather afraid that that will not do us any good&apos;in India because already we have got more tonnage in the East than is required and this excess tonnage there will simply prejudice the homeward market.     Then with regard to Russia, there was a letter ,in the Shipping Gazette yesterday from the Russian authorities complaining that they could not get British tonnage, principally for their timber business and stating that they had chartered one or two steamers and that the owners were very pleased to charter with them.     There is any amount of British tonnage waiting to charter with the Russian authorities, but Russia is attempting, to enforce conditions which are not customary in the trade and that Is the one and only reason why the British steamers are not prepared to charter with the Russians,    The condition is the payment of hire.    It has been the invariable custom that when people charter steamers on time
they pay hire in advance.   Russia wants to pay at some subsequent date.    As they write to the papers complaining I thought it was only fair I should mention that.With regard to shipbuilding, it has been left to me to say something about it.    A few orders have been placed for small passenger steamers for local services and for a couple of small tankers for the Canadian Government and an order,..has been placed to replace the loss of the &quot;Highland Eope&quot;s* . With those exceptions no orders are being given.    As far as tramp steamers are concerned I do not think a single order has been placed for months.     The laid-up tonnage, according to the latest figure given by the Chamber of Shipping which must be to a certain extent an estimate but is as near as they can get it, is the largest on record.It amounts to 7 to 8 million tons gross.    That is world tonnage, of course, which is equivalent to about 12 million tons dead weight capacity, and that represents more than 10$ of the total world tonnage.    The fact of all that tonnage being laid up shows I think that if Russia wanted to charter tonnage on proper terms she would have no difficulty in getting all she wanted.    I will put in the usual statement of figure sCOLONIAL TRADE.MR. CLAGSONt I will put in the usual paper on the trade in the Colonies       I should like to read one particular extract because I think it is of interest.   It comes from East Africa.    !It is reported that a, Japanese Trade Delegation with 13 tons of samples, has arrived and taken up Headquarters in Mombasa.    The local Chamber of Commerce are in communication with the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, drawing attention to this and suggesting that some counter propaganda might be instituted to combat the steadily growing demand for non--Rritish goods.&apos; That is a thing that we inthe Colonial Office would very much like to help on if we could, but it is very difficult for us to do it.   The Department of Overseas Trade I think have been trying to do something in the matter but it is primarily a question of initiative by the traders.    As a matter of fact the other day a very talkative gentleman whose name I have forgotten came to see Dr. Shiels and said he was going out to East Africa to try and embark on some propaganda.   He said that the cost of a sole agency in a place like East Africa is very great. If a firm is going to maintain a man as their sole agent it costs them getting on for  2,000 a year, but it is perfectly-easy for one man to hold a number of agencies and of course the cost is in that way very much reduced.   That is rather outside our line of oountry but I would rather commend it to the meeting.*See Appendix page 48 $See Appendix page 38.
1? fl c*JL \3 UAs regards the general position 1 do not see I am afraid   any      improvement at all, in fact it is very doubtful whether there is any Colonial product which is being sold except below cost of production, with the exception of gold,  and unfortunately we have not got very much gold in the Colonies, while various Colonial Governments have been approached by local interests and are being told that whole industries are going out of existence unless some help caxi be given to them.   In Kenya we were told that unless the Kenya Government did something for maize a whole lot of perfectly good land would revert to weeds and the Kenya Government as a matter of fact has started a scheme.    The same trouble is beginning to develop in the case of Sisal in Tanganyika and there again the industry is asking for assistance and pointing; out that if assistance is not given a large element of taxpayers will disappear.    We very badly want some impetus to increase prices,I think it wa,s Mr. Lennox Lee who mentioned the question of silver,   A great number of very misleading statements have appeared in the papers.   Perhaps I might say that the Secretary of State Is sending out a small commission to Hong Kong at the end of this month.    It consists of the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Mr. Ezechiel, one of the Crown Agents, and myself.   We are going out to study the question of Hong Kong currency. Honp Kong is the only Colony, and the only country in the world, for all practical purposes, except China and Abyssinia, that has a silver currency.   The price of silver now is somewhere about 50fc of its pre-war price and it has very much upset all the Far Eastern trade.,    In the case of Kong Kong the currency required looking at for other reasons, but what we propose to do is to go out with entirely open minds and to see whether anything can be done We are not committed to continuing, on a silver standard or to going on to a gold standard.   We are not committed in any way, but we are going out to examine the position.    We are not going out, as some of the financial papers suggest, to restore the price of silver, but merely to see what is happening.MR. ?/ALTER SMITH:    Has the point you mentioned about merging agencies been brought to the notice of the Overseas Trade Department?MR. OLAUSON. I think at any rate it is present&apos;&apos;to thei minds,MR. WALTER SMITH; I do not know how far they might possibly take it up, with some particular Chamber of Commerce, or for instance with the Cotton Industry, to see how far it was possible to do that.    It certainly seems to be the right think to do in some of these Colonies.ALDERMAN TITTERINGTOK: Is not the point Mr. Clauson raises the whole question of arrangements for the exporting industry.    Is it riot a reflection of the individualism of the particular industry, for example, the wool textile tra,de?    Is it not poesible for the Colonial Office to have a survey of the agencies in foreign countries which show a duplication of agencies?   Mr. Clauson said it was not withi the purview of   hie Department.   I respectfully suggest it might usefully be within their purview axiyhow.
JW.. WALTER SMITH:    I think it would be within the purview of the Department of Overseas Trade to take that up.   They are the body that deals with the appointment of trade commissioners and all matters dealing with trade overseas.ALDERMaN TITTERINGTON:    It would be very interesting to see how the agents do duplicate the respective products of each industry.MR. WALTER SMITH:    I do not know how far in the consultations the Department of Overseas   Trade has been brought into it.mr.. CLaUSON:    We sent that man along to the Department of Overseas Trade-.    My idea was not so much agencies from separate manufacturers of the same class of goods.    I think this gentleman had an idea that be was going to travel in motor cars and socks and agricultural implements and a variety of quite different trades.      In a place like Tanganyika where there is a small white population they are interested in a wide range of articles.MR. WALTER SMITH:    With a relatively small market for any particular article but in the aggregate it is worth having.MR.  CLAUSON:    Yes.ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:    The point was that they were incurring excess costs which were reflected in production on this side.    That is a matter which we could usefully pursue I think.    It was a point brought out in the recent luciuillan Court of Enquiry, the development of agencies abroad.MR. WALMSLEY:    There is nothing new in this question of agencies because we have had a good deal of experience and we have found it is always very unsatisfactory.    If we appoint one of these general agents for steel we find that he is selling toothpaste and soap and fountain pens and all that sort of thing and he does not know anything about steel and it is entirely unsatisfactory.   There are great difficulties in the way of that sort of general agent.MR. WALTER SMITH:    But still there is no harm in examining the position to see how far it might be done. On the face of it it looks to be an advantage.    I suppose it would depend upon finding individuals who were possessed of an ability to push a variety of goods.INDIAN TRADE.. MR. LINDSAY:    I have just received the figures of India&apos;s trade for 1930 and I shall put those in,* with the following two comments.    The Import trade has fallen from 1929 to 1930 by 26% and our export trade has fallen during the same period by 22,-V;.    I have taken out for purposes of comparison the fall in the average wholesale price index showing that between 1929 and 1930 wholesale prices in India fell by IB?L    I thinkAppendix page 70.
those figures are rather striking,    a fall of 26% in imports sounds very serious and of course it is very serious, but one has to remember that 18%&apos; of that represents a fall in prices.    The other comment I have to make is in regard to the percentage of imports of British trade.    There is an article in to-day&apos;s &quot;Times&quot;-x which draws attention, I think rather exaggerated attention, to the effect of the boycott on the proportion of British trade with India,    The proportion that the United Kingdom held In India1 s total imports in 1929 was 42.4 per cent.   The proportion in 1930 was 40%&apos;.    It is a very slight fall and I think there are rather exaggerated Ideas abroad as to the effect of the boycott, as to how much of it is really froth and how much of it is really business,    I should think there are not very many parts of the Empire which import so high a proportion as 40  British in their total import trade.    On the export side the outlook is slightly more cheering. This country took 21.2 per cent, of our exports In 1929 and 21.75 per cent, in 1930.Then with regard to wholesale and retail prices - I find that our price index for 1930 taken month by month shows a fall in wholesale prices on the Calcutta system from 131, that is to say 31 over pre-war, in January 1930 to 101 in December, 1930.    In other words wholesale prices are now only 13 over the price level of July 1914.    According to our retail price index system which is not based on Calcutta but on Bombay and therefore is not an exact comparison (but they are the only two parallel systems available for comparison), retail prices have fallen from 1.47 in January to 122 in December so that as we stand in December, retail prices are 122 and wholesale 101 and a fall has occurred during the year in wholesale prices of 23%&apos; and in retail prices of only 17*.I have nothing to add in regard bo the crop position except that the harvest hitherto has been normal and that as far as we can see at present the production will be normal during the year.I wish to correct a mis-statement which I made at the December meetingf.   You asked me for the reasons underlying the continued imports of Australian wheat into India and I replied that I had no precise information at the time but thought that the imports were sporadic imports due to speculative forward contracts.   That is not correct.   The Imports of wheat from Australia Into India have continued fairly steadily and are apparently due chiefly to differences of price in favour of the Australian wheat.   There is one point of interest, that all those purchases have been for mills at the ports in India; that is to say the port is the point at which the Australian wheat has an advantage over the up-country Indian wheat.I think Sir Ernest Glover referred to a shipment of Russian sugar to India comparatively recently and in that connection I should like to draw attention to a rumour that I see has crept into the Press, that the Government of India* Appendix page 71 where is reproduced also a further Article from &quot;Times&quot; of February 16th.T See Minutes of Meeting of December, 1930, page 27.
-*See Appendix page 30.lias decided to raise their import duty on sugar with effect from 1st march.    I have no idea what their intentions are, hut they certainly have not made any announcement at all. What has happened is that in ivjay of last year at the request of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research the Government of India instructed the Indian Tariff Board to hold an enquiry into the validity of the claim of the sugar industry in India to protection.   That enquiry is being held and as far as I am aware the Tariff Board has not yet reported to the Government and it is, I should say, very unlikely that the Government would take action until it had reported. The report may of course be received at any time.SIR GEORGE BLBaRRELL:    There is very little change in the rubber industry since I last reported to the Council. Tyres, of course, so far as first equipment is concerned, depend on the condition of the motor car Industry.    I am rather sorry Sir William JViorris was not able to be here this morning to give his report on that industry because from my knowledge the season up to the present is somewhat disappointing and it is not doing anything like the volume we anticipated they would do as the result of the Show, but it is early in the season yet and there is still time for it to pick up.    The replacement business in tyres keeps very steady.   It is about the same as the previous year. I have figures of export for the 11 months.    Motor covers show an increase (in numbers) in export of 10.C and tubes show about the same figure, that is exports from this country as compared with a very heavy decrease In exports from the United States and also Canada and it looks to me as if the increase from this country has been at the expense of Canada.   Those firms who have established works here, in order to give them some reasonable overhead, have diverted some of their business from their Canadian factory to the factory at home.   The general rubber business is feeling the result of disturbances in the trade and also, of course, the depression in trade,   mechanical rubbers probably have never been so low in demand for a very long time.   Boots and shoes on the other hand although It is between seasons are doing fairly well although we   are feeling very severe Japanese competition both at home and abroad.    They are quoting exceedingly low prices, in fact, in this market almost below the cost of pure labour and material and in the foreign markets this competition is even more  severe.    Sports goods, we are just between seasons. That will depend very largely on the state of trade generally.   We find that sports goods are one of the things where economy is being practised.     In waterproof rubber garments, trade is showing some signs of development and there has been an adjustment of wages brought about by the Association and the Union which should stimulate business.There is no.other detail I need trouble about. I will just hand in my report. *-MR. CLaUSOK:    There is one question I should like to ask, now that rubber is so low in price is there any prospect of a development in the use of rubber for roadways?
SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL:    I have not seen any practical scheme yet that would be worth spending a great deal of money on.    It has had a good deal of consideration but there are two reasons, first of all that even at the present price of rubber a road would be very expensive and secondly, no one can guarantee a continuance of that price and therefore a prudent manufacturer would not spend very much capital on it, on what may be a temporary state of affairs as regards the cost of raw materials.SIR C. HURCOMB:    There ape some sections of road in which rubber has been used which are under very close observation just now but it is too early to say, even from the technical point of view, just how it will work out.(The proceedings terminated).

The sale of tyres for first equipment is entirels&apos;- dependent   upon the condition of the Motor Car Industry and a separate report as to the position of that Industry is submitted.as regards Replacement business, the need for economy is causing many people to wear their tyres to the utmost extent and the volume of replacement business is slightly below that of last year.The Exports from this country held up last year extremely well having regard to the depressed condition of Industry throughout the world and it would appear as though the relative position of Gt, Britain in the export field had been improved.     Competition, however,  is extremely keen both at home and overseas.United i:ingdomjExport.11 Biths. 1929.    11 mths. 1950.1  178,524 1,295,183Motor Covers  ......... 1 015 346 1,132,197Motor Tubes .......... ^  85 834 120,337M/Cycle Covers ....... 85,834 ll9&apos;,9QQ-/Cycle Tubes ........ 2,257,613 2,030,482Cycle Covers ......... ?         556 1,474,315Cycle ^bes .......... ^st 555 16,037Solids...............Boots and Shoes.      The present period is between seasons. The demand is &quot;really filling up for the end of the Winter season and looking ahead to advance orders for Summer foot-wear.     Prices are extremely depressed.     Competition from various sources is very keen and Japanese Manufacturers have quoted extremely low prices.Building Plans Approved&quot;by local authorities in some 140 of the principal urban areas in Great Britain (except L.O.C. area) during 1924-1930.
The Export markets are the subject of intensive competition especially from Japan.Rubber Soles and Heels.     The demand for this product remains steady&quot;but it is&quot;a subject of the very keenest competition with prices freely offered below the cost of production in this country.Ilechanicals.     Hoses and belts are the principal lines in demand hut the general condition of the Home ilaricet is very dull with consequently very keen competition.     The future outlook is not good.Sports Goods.      This is a quiet season of the year hut the outlook is not very favourable owing to the depressed state of general trade.Ebonite. The condition of both the Home and Export trade is unsatisfactory. The usual seasonal trade having failed to reach the average - competition is very Keen -prices quoted by foreign manufacturers exceedingly low, in fact, in many cases below production cost in this country. The seasonal demand has now practically come to an end and the outlook is unpromising.Waterproof Garments.     Home and. Export trade continue to be very quiet and orders small in volume.As   a result of negotiations between the Waterproof Garment Section of the India Rubber ..Manufacturers Association and the Waterproof Garment association Trade Union, a reduction in wage rates has been agreed, which should assist in stimulating business.BOOTS AM) SHOES.MR. BOSTOCK sent the following reportNorthampton.      The trade current still moves somewhat sluggishly in Northampton, and it would appear that shoe buyers persist in their policy of extreme caution in regard to purchases.      Only a minority of manufacturers are really fortunateljr placed, and, in the absence of any considerable forward business,  the general position leaves much to be desired.     It is, however, expected that a more healthy state of things will be experienced in a reek or two,Leicester.     The local position is not yet satisfactory, despite the fact that here and there one receives reports from principals that production is fully up to capacity.One of the features of the present trade in women&apos;s shoes is the almost complete absence of demand for anything that can be retailed at from half a guinea to a guinea.    The latter quality shoe and: the 8/11 line are selling quite well, but few people seem to want anything in between.lettering.      Those in a position accurately to gauge the trend of trade agree that there is a steady improvements
Both factors and retailers are in a buying mood, and orders coming to hand have created further activity in the district.     A few firms are really busy and others are gradually getting back to normal hours of working.Stafford.     Reports from various factories show that there is a definite improvement in trade, although the volume of business has not reached expectations, and there are not many firms able to give full employment to their operatives.DISTRIBUTING TRADES...SIR WOODMAN BURBIDG-E sent the following report:-I am putting in the usual table for December trade, from which it will be observed that sales for Great Britain as a whole were down by. 2.5$ as compared with December 1929.&apos; When it is remembered that, according to the cost of living index figure, retail prices have fallen by 7.8$ over the same period there can be little doubt that, although measured in money the sales were lower, a greater volume of goods passed into consumption during the month than was the case last year.     This fact will account for the small reduction in employment, while the fall in the value of stocks at cost is lower than at any previous month since these figures began to appear.     That retail trade in this country, as represented &quot;by the Departmental Stores, is holding up fairly well against the prevailing depression, is brought out by a comparison with results in the United States and Germany.      In the United States, according to the Federal Reserve Board, sales in the Departmental Stores during October, November and December fell,  as compared with the corresponding month in the previous year, by 8%, 14$ and 9% respectively.   According to the Institut filr Konjunkturforschung sales in the German Departmental Stores fell in October and November by 8.4$ and 14$.     The corresponding figures for this country for October, november and December are 4.4?$, 5,,9$ and 2.5$.      I would also draw your attention to the results for the half year from August to December inclusive, when sales for Great Britain as a whole fell by 3,7?$, although for the South of England in spite of the   fall in prices cash sales actually increased by a small percentage. The heaviest drop during the half year has been felt by the West End Stores, where sales have fallen off by 6.4$.It has not yet been possible to work out the figures for January trade, but it will be surprising if more favourable&apos;results are not shown than in previous months. This should especially be the case with the West End Stores, where the half-yearly Sales appear-to have been phenomenally successful all round.      In spite of the depression and the fall in prices,  reports of record trading have been received from many&quot; Stores,  and it looks as if the public had been deliberately holding off until the Sales provided a more favourable opportunity for making their purchases.

IRON AND STEEL.MR. CHADWIOK handed in the following Report and St&amp;t ernent ;-Having caused a rough analysis of the Foundry Industry to be made sone startling results have revealed themselves.It appears that whilst there are some 7,000 foundries in Great Britain;    there are some 3,700 founders.   An analysis shows that there are 150 steel foundries;    300 light alloy; 3,000 non-ferrous and 3,000 iron foundries including 190&quot; malleable.So far as we can trace there is a gradual diminution in the number of foundries, bi-annually, about 50 foundries and about 25 new ones start.For instance Germany has only 2,000 iron foundries for a larger population;    France has about 1,500.Further there is a unification of both regional and industrial, i.e., grouping of pipe foundries;    light casting and the like;    co-operative buying and price fixation through the imposition of a standardised costs system.Representatives of the Employers Federation and Trade Unions in Britain are at present in touch with each other considering the state of this important industry, with the end in view of seeing what can be done to extricate it from its present perilous position.

CO-OPERATIVE TRADE 117 SCOTLAND.Extract from Report handed in by MR. CAIRHS:rthile a few of the Departments and Factories are steadily maintaining the usual flow of business the trade as a whole exhibits a downward tendency, and a large majority of the units are being subjected to a lessening turnover, which is now in excess of the amount that can be assigned to a mere fall in values.The factories employ an average number of --,933 persons and among those engaged in the textile, the leather and the furniture industries spells of short time are of frequent occurrence.    The value of the productions for 19 30 was  5,793,827, while for 1909 the value was  6,152,730.Prior to last year the furniture factory had a long run of expanding trade of which a large part was imputed to the needs created by Municipal Housing Schemes, but while these still continue in a measure, the demand has fallen off, for the good-class of hone-made furniture.    We observe an Increasing demand for imported furniture of a cheaper class, probably stimulated by a decline in the purchasing power of the members owing to the scarcity of employment.The experience of our Tannery is that all types of hides used by British firms are still moving towards lower prices, and last month the average price of hides was 23 per cent, lower than that for the corresponding month of 1930.    In the same period the average price of materials used in the process of tanning fell to the extent of l.&apos;l per cent.Our Jute Factory after a disastrous year in results during 1930, while it is still far from prosperous, has begun the year with somewhat enhanced prospects.    For a considerable time, life has been crushed out of the market by the burden of large stocks, but now the Calcutta Jute kills Association seems to realise the damaging effect of this state of things and proposes to curtail production both by working shorter hours and by closing down a portion of machinery.The kill for the making of wrapping Paper is fully employed. There is some curiosity in the trade regarding  the action of the foreign mills in the matter of prices when the safeguarding duty lapses in April.     Latterly they have reduced prices, until with the addition of the duty they have reached a competitive level with those of the home mills.      The question is, will they take advantage of the abolition of the dirty to raise their prices?On the distributive side of the business the chief features of the drapery and furnishing tradeB continue to be declining sales,  and low prices.    These generally are lower than they have been since 1914.In the principal articles of food there was no material change during the month either in supply or demand.    The sugar market is dull and lifeless with supplies plentiful, buying restricted to immediate needs and prices showing a downward tendency.Butter is a thing that has displayed considerable elasticity in the demand for it and the low prices have had the effect of creating a large increase of consumption.
Russian wheat of whioh the supplies are plentiful is not altogether suitable for Scotch bread and in consequence millers have been buying more freely of Canadian to Impart strength to the mixture of wheat in their flour.     Mainly as a result of this procedure local quotations for Canadian have recently advanced l/9 per quarter.    Home wheat is very low in price and has fallen about 2/- per quarter in the course of the month.   Millers are using very little of it as the quality is generally inferior&quot;for milling purposes.     Very few samples of really good Scotch wheat have been presented in the market this season.COLONIAL TRAPS.MR. CLAUSON handed in the following Report:-British Malaya.a table of comparative Rubber Statistics is attached which contains the latest available information as to Foreign imports, Gross and Domestic Exports and Stocks in hand.Nigeria.A statement of the Colony&apos;s Trade for the years 19H7-1929 is annexed, together with the observations of the Nigeria Customs Department on the figures in question.The Trade Commissioner for Cyprus, in London, has furnished a report on the period 1st -September - 31st December, 1930.    He points out that while Cyprus has suffered from the world depression in a lesser degree than many other countries, there has been a marked deorease in both import and export trade.   The values of merchandise imported and exported since January, 1930, are lower than at any time since 1927, although the quantities are in some instances greater.     The adverse balance of trade has, however, been reduced. During the 11 months January to November, 1930,  (the latest figures available at the time of the report) Cyprus exports to the United Kingdom declined by 14$ from the value for that period of 1929, while imports from the United Kingdom dropped by 20$.   Returns up to the end of October,  1930, and 1929 shew a total falling off in value of imports of 29$ and exports 28$.    1929 was, however, a record year.The decrease in trade is attributed in part to the world slump in commodity prices, to a certain measure of over production which affects the purchasing power of the community and, to an extent, to the fluctuations in the price of gold, although it is admitted that. neither any nor all of these factors can be held fully to account for the present plight of trade.Trade Returns^Schedules are attached containing the latest available Trade Statistics for the following territories:-Nigeria, Tanganyika Territory, Northern Rhodesia, Gold Coast, Ceylon, Sierra Leone and Cyprus.The schedule shew the monthly increase or decrease in both Imports and Exports as compared with the 1929 figures, and also the state of the Trade Balance in each territory.    The percentage of Imports derived from the United Kingdom is shewn whenever the necessary information is available.

These compete with similar products derived from other sources such as copra, soya beans, whale oil&apos;, Indian groundnuts, etc.     The production of these materials in 1927 was in round figures, 2,500,000 tons, while in 1929 it amounted to 4,000,000 tons, an increase of 65$ in 2 years.     Thus supply exceeded denand, consumption could not keep pace with production, consequently the worldfs markets were glutted, prices fall disastrously and the purchasing power of Nigeria was reduced accordingly.&quot;It is, howevemore in 1929 than it must have been still higher.r, interesting to note that despite these comments the Export Trade of Nig3ria was slightly in 1928, and was, in fact, higher than it has ever been and, had it not bean for the slump,Trade Statement for the years 1927-1929 (all figures exclusive of specie and notes).

SHIPPING.SIR ERNEST V/. GLOVER handed in the following statement -Markets generally have continued without material change.    The Index No.  for Freights for January is 87.86, as compared with 89.66 for December, based on 100 as the figure for 1913.Outward Business for Coal.    Chartering was resumed after the Coal settlement but rates are without improvement and in the long voyages barely above the cost of ballast voyages.General Cargo.    Owing to financial difficulties in Australia, the lowness of exchange in the Argentine, and the boycott which continues in India, business is very restricted.Homeward Grain Chartering.    The stocks of grain stored by Russia in this country have been mostly disposed of, but further shipments are being only sparingly made, /ossibly as a consequence, both Australia and the Argentine have been shipping more freely.    A large business has been transacted from the Argentine.     No doubt the exchange position which interferes with outward shipment facilitates homeward business.East   remains a very dull market with only small occasional demand for tonnage.    A large quantity of sugar is being shipped from South Russia to India in consequence of which it is feared there may be more homeward tonnage available than the market can conveniently absorb.Russia. a letter appeared in the Shipping Gazatte yesterday stating that the Soviet authorities were unable to obtain an adequate supply of British tonnage, probably meaning for timber business.    It is desirable to point out that the explanation is that the Russians are attempting to force terms wn the Shipowners that no other Time Charterers ask for.    There is an abundance of British tonnage anxious for business if the terms are right.Canada is beginning to shew slight interest in shipping wheat and some charters have been recently made.Shipbuilding.    The only orders placed are for moderate sized passenger steamers for local services,  two small tankers for Canada and a motor vessel to replace the &quot;Highland Hope&quot;. No orders have been given for tramp steamers for at least 6 months.Shipment of coal shews a falling off in December of 200,000 tons compared with November and nearly 750,000 compared with December 1929,Laid up Tonnage.    Recent investigations by the Chamber of Ship&quot;ping point to the enormous figure of about 12 million tons deadweight capacity being demobilised in the World.I enclose the usual statistics.

BANKING.MR.  GOODENOUGH sent the following report.-The past month has witnessed a distinctly firmer tendency in both the short loan and the discount markets. On January 5th, day-to-day money was commanding only about 1 to 1-g- per cent. , but recently the rate has been as high as 3 per cent., whilst the quotation for three months&apos; fine bank bills has risen   1/16-2? to 2 7/16-2^.       Unfortunately, this development cannot be attributed to an improvement in the industrial situation, resulting in increased demands for banking accommodation to finance a larger volume of trade, but rather to the influence of open market operations on the part of the Authorities,  in order to check the continued outflow of gold.      The decision of the Bank of France during January to accept gold of 9/10ths.  fineness and over now enables British standard gold to be sold to that Institution without its first having to be refined. Therefore,  after the decision became operative, the daily withdrawals from the Bank of England on French account, which hitherto had been restricted by the limited refining facilities available, were continued on a much larger scale.      The gold held in the Issue Department of the Bank of England,  which on December 31st,  1930, amounted to  147.6 millions, declined by January 28th 193.&quot;&quot;,  to  139.5 millions. In addition to the Frenchdemands,  there was a possibility during the second half of January that gold would be taken for shipment to the United States,  owing to the low level of the London/New icvk exchange and it was,  therefore considered necessary that efforts should be made to stiffen interest rates in London by&apos;substantial sales   of bills by special quarters. This action was successful and not only were gold exports to America averted, but the withdrawals on French account were also terminated,  the appreciation of sterling in terms of both the dollar and the franc raising the exchange quotations well above the gold export points.    In the week ending February 4th,  the Bank of England&apos;s gold holding in the Issue Department increased to  140.4 millions but,  in spite of the easy monetary conditions prevailing in Ne\; York, as well as in a number of important Continental centres, it would seem essential that the recent rise in interest rates in London should be maintained.    Practically all the fine gold which has arrived in London during the past month has been taken for shipment to France.      In comparison with a month ago, most of the leading foreign exchanges have moved in favour of sterlings-There has been a slight increase in activity on the Stock Exchange, although, with the exception of securities of a sound investment character,  public support has been small.    During the month, British funds have eased somewhat,  and India loans have also fallen, but the subscription list for the new Cash issue of  12 million India 5-  per cent.  1936/38 at 97,  which opened on February 9t.h, was quickly closed.    At times, the market in Australian Government stocks has been nominal.    Slightly more business has taken place in Industrial securities.SIR GUY GRA1TET  handed in the following re port:-The hope expressed in my last Report that the reduction of the New York and Paris &quot;Bank Rates&quot; would benefit the
1 *v 9 x osterling exchange with those centres did not materialise,  in fact by January 22nd the value of sterling in the New York Exchange became so low that there was a danger of gold being withdrawn from the Bank of England for shipment to America. This possibility caused the rate for three months bills to rise rather sharply from 2 1/8$ to 2 5/16?^, a rate which encouraged the American Banks to buy Lyndon bills.    This action influenced the exchange with New York which moved sufficiently in favour of sterling to avert a gold shipment to America.Owing to the short supply of bills in the London Market it was unlikely that the Discount Rate would be maintained at 2 5/16$ against any sustained demand and the Bank of England realising this fact decided to endeavour to obtain active control of the Money Market by means of large offerings of Treasury Bills, which brought the Discount Rate up to 2 7/16% at which figure it has been stabilised as a minimum since the last v/eek in January,    In normal times the unsatisfactory position of the principal exchanges would have been sufficient to cause the bill rate in the open market to be fractionally below the official rate say 2 7/8$, but owing to the small trade demand for bank loans the Banks all over the &amp;orld have large sums available for short term investment,  for which bills provide J,ne only alternative.     However, partly owing to the inf.low of Revenue that commences at this time of the year, the supply of call money is becoming less plentiful than a month ago,  and this movement should assist the maintenance of Bill and Money Rates.      Actually the supply of money became so restricted on the 9th instant that the Bank of England reversed their recent policy and bought baok at eome of the bills they had previously sold to the market at 2 7/Ie^S, otherwise it w&amp;uld have been necessary for the Discount Market to seek loans from the Bank of England for a period of a week.  In addition to removing the threat of gold shipments to America the higher rates have attracted French money, and for the time being stopped the recent steady flow of gold to Paris, and has enabled the Bank of England to slightly increase its stock of gold as compared with its holding of the metal at the end of January.The price of silver has this week been quoted at 12d, per ounce which is the lowest price on record and compares with 21d. per ounce a year ago.    The slump in the price of silver is a serious hindrance to trade with those countries which are large producers of the metal cr use it for their currency as it really means reduced purchasing power and great loss on savings represented by silver coins or bars.On the Stock Exchange business has again been mainly confined to high class investment transactions,  although the market for shares in mining companies producing gold has shewn a little activity.The Home Rail Market has been very depressed on the poor returns for the past year and the market for industrial shares has reflected the bad condition of trade.The majority of new issues of capital continue to be of an investment character, and for the month of January were unusually small in volume.
WOOLLSH AND WORSTED INDUSTRY,MR. HAMILTON sont the following reportThe conditions prevailing in December continued during the greater part of January.       The first series of Wool Sales opened in London on the 20th January, with a drop in prices of 105o to 15*.       After a few days hesitation buyers recovered confidence and began to operate more freely,. This improvement developed into a strong covering movement. Large orders for wool and tops were placed, and by the end of the month the initial fall in values had been practically recovered.    Whether this improvement in trade will last or not it is impossible to forecast.     Uool haB certainly boon selling at prices, which if continued would mean ruin for the farmers.       On the other hand the Textile Industry can hardly hope to escape this oevere depression which is affecting every staple trade, also nado-up garments are still dear enough to preclude the purchase by the public of more clothing than is really necessary.     Taken as a whole the machinery activity in the Industry is not less satisfactory than in most European countries, and is distinctly better than in the United States of America.EMPLOYMENT.MR. HILIOB sent the following report:-EmpJLojrment^ in January,  1951.There was some fluctuation during January in the numbers on the registers of Employment Exchanges but at 2nd February tho total was 18,891 below the figure for 39th December.    The total at the latter date was 2,643,127.    In the following ?/eek there was a drop of about .25,000 followed by a rise of 18,000 at 12th January.    In each of the next two weeks the figures fell again, the aggregate drop being 43,500, but in the last week of the month there was a further rise of 31,600.The net fall of nearly 19,000 during the month included an increase of 131,351 in the numbers wholly unemployed and a decrease of 150,242 in the numbers temporarily stopped.The number of men on the Register decreased by 13,172, the number of women decreased by 22,364 and the number of juveniles increased by 16,345 through the addition of Christmas School-leavers to the register.In the London, South Eastern arid South western Divisions there was the usual seasonal increase in the first half of January but the numbers unemployed fell during the second half.In all the other Divisions the numbers fluctuated during the month and the net variations were as follows:-
London, South Eastern and South Western . .4-44,07 3Midlands-21,131North Eastern* 7,478North Western-30,058Scotland- 7,104Wales-12,099In the North Eastern Division, the operation of coal marketing schemes was responsible for the greater part of an increase of 27,735 at 2nd February as compared with 25th January, and but for this increase every Division except those in the South would have shown a net improvement during the month.Among the principal industries there was little change between 22nd December and 26th January in coal mining, and general engineering.     There was a slight decline in pig iron manufacture but some improvement in the steel industry.Employment declined in electrical, marine and constructional Engineering, in Shipbuilding and Ship repair-ing and in the wool textile and distributive trades and there was also a further seasonal decline in the building trade.      There was a slight improvement in the Motor Vehicle industry.      In the Ootton industry although the percentage rate of unemployment fell slightly there were between 150,000 and 200,000 workers directly involved in a trade dispute in the &quot;weaving Section who were not included in the unemployment figures.The total number of insured persons in employment at 25th January,  1931, is estimated provisionally to be about 149,300 less than at 22nd December,  1930, and about 815,700 less than at 27th January,  1930.    In these comparisons no account has been taken of the Lancashire cotton dispute since precise figures of the numbers directly involved in that dispute are not yet available.

SOUTH AH ERICAH TRADE.MR. FOLLETT HOLT handed in the following report:Argentina.     The Provisional Government remains in power.    Its Members realise the importance of a return to a constitutional form of Government.   It is proposed therefore to hold the provincial elections within the next two or three months,    if the results prove favourable the elections of the Federal Authorities will follow towards the end of the year and a Rational Government will be secured, comprised of Members of equally high status to those at present in power.The British Empire Trade Exhibition will be opened in Buenos Aires by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales on the 14th of next month.    It may be claimed that, since the defeat of the British forces in Buenos Aires under Whitelock in 1808 and the acquisition of British Guiana in 1814, this is the most striking single British event that has happened in South America.    The participation of some 900 exhibitors, including the British and Canadian Governments, the presence of the Representative of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, the work that has been carried out in transforming the external appearance of the exhibition buildings, which include a replica of St. Jamesfs Palace, and the remarkable exhibits, are factors likely to have a psychological and material effect upon those with whom we trade.On the basis that where in the National Cause the Prince leads more humble folk might well follow, it is suggested that the Punch cartoon of the 21st of January might well be forwarded as part of the permanent equipment to each of the Embassies and Legations in South America as a reminder, if need be in the future, that trade is the essential object of the presence of the heads of our missions on that Continent.The outlook for trade in the immediate future in Argentina does not held out great prospect of improvement. Owing largely to the Iocs of rrops which occurred last year national finances have fallen into a state of disequilibrium.    The harvest this year promises to be good, but low celling prices for cei-eals and all produce must affect a prompt recovery.    The par rate of the gold dollar Is 47V8d. whereas the current rate of exchange is now round about 35.Argentina possesses a gold backing of some eighty million sterling to her currency, though the free movement of gold is at present restricted.^ The Provisional Government expresses its determination to bring Argentine exchange gradually back to par.    With this object they have taken steps to balance the National Budget and to -consolidate the foreign floating debt.    The first step has been accomplished, according to telegrams just received, and the second is now under very careful consideration.Uruguay.    Owing t3 depression in world trade and the reduction&quot;In value of Uruguayan exports, that Country is, liko Argentina, suffering from a depreciation in the sterling value of its currency.    At the present moment Uruguayan exchange is at a discount of about 30^.
The outstanding recent event has been the proposal of the Uruguayan Government to purchase the property of the Central Uruguay Railway of iiontevideo, together with its extension Companies.    The general idea was commendable, being that under State ownership the Railways would be developed with the roads, each to help the other and not oppose as at present, a large sum in gold bonds was involved in the proposal to purchase the Railways.   When the Government fully realised the heavy loss in exchange that would be incurred in remitting the interest on these bonds - a loss now thrown upon the shareholders of the British Company - the proposal was withdrawn.Brazil.   Not since the beginning of the present century has Brazil&apos;s internal trade touched so low a point.   Though the balance of exports at some  12,000,000 for the first ten months of 1930 shows a considerable advance over the sav.ie period for the previous year, the advantage is due to a restriction of imports and not an increase of exports.The position as regards coffee must be faced.    It is estimated that at the end of the present crop year the world carry-over of coffee stocks will run into some 24,000,000 bags, representing practically one year&apos;s world consumption.The total currency issueK which is now entirely without a gold backing, amounts to 2,713,000 contos of reis, which at exchange of 5d. per mil reis Is equal to  56,500,000.The financial position of Brazil is critical, but London has always been a good friend to that Country.    Sir Otto Niemeyer, at the request of the Brazilian Government, is now on his way to Rio.   Meanwhile temporary accommodation has been afforded mainly by London to the extent of  3,500,000.Chile:    The Country is very largely dependent upon Nitrate, which has been over-produced and has the synthetic product as a competitor.kuch of the future depends upon the extent of A 1 american support to &quot;The Compania Salitrera de Chile&quot;   (Gosach), a scheme to amalgamate all nitrate producers into a ilational Company in which the Chilean Government will hold one half of the share capital.    Negotiations are proceeding.The other important industry - Copper - is severely affected by the prevailing low price and demand.The Country has been over-spending on public works and in other ways, all now drastically curtailed.Chile was a happy hunting-ground for British traders, but America having now the control of the copper fields, and &quot;rith the possibility of obtaining a paramount interest in Nitrate, our prospects there are not too bright at the moment.Colombia^ - &apos;Columbia is suffering a severe reaction from the -effects of&quot; the liberal expenditure of the extravagant sums that were provided in recent years by U.S.A.    Ho further loans are forthcoming from that source at present, and the Country is struggling to readjust its affairs, inadvisedly disturbed.   A Country of many resources and good intentions, its return to normality may be expected.     Under more workable laws its oilfields are now likely to be developed more rapidly.

These shew that the number of passengers (excluding season ticket holders) conveyed over all standard gauge railways in Great Britain (excluding the London Tubes and Metropolitan District Railway) was 23,752,987, or 2.79 per cent, less during the eleven months than in the corresponding period of 1929.    Three-fourths of the decrease was in respect of passengers conveyed at standard or ordinary fares.&apos;   The reduction in the tonnage of freight traffic during the eleven months was as under:-Decrease *-Tons.

Motor Industry.SIR CYRIL HURC01IB   handed in the following statement:-The number of Motor Vehicles (excluding motor cycles) newly registered in December, 1930, was 1,820 more than in the corresponding period of 1929 and 1,615 more than in the corresponding period of 1928.     These increases are made up as under:-Increase as compared	with December.		1929	1928	1,585	398	305	995	77	107	53	115	1,820	1,615Motor cycles shew an increase	of 433 compared	withDecember 1929 and a decreaoe of 501 compared with December 1928.The British Coal Industry in 1930.MR. BENTON JONES handed in the following report:-The check to business activity which occurred in the autumn of 1929 and deepened into one of the worst depressions of recent times in 1930, could hardly fail to affect the coal industry.After prices had been stable to a greater or less extent since 1926 such a violent drop as 17.59$ in a period of 15 months is all the more remarkable.     Combined with this reduction in industrial activity the marKet for domestic fuel was also affected by the circumstance that the winter of 1929/30 was one of the mildest on record.      In contradistinction to prices generally those of coal remained comparatively stable in the period from October 1929 to December 1930.     This was largely owing to the fact that coal prices had fallen to a greater extent than prices generally in previous years.The production of coal producing countries in Europe in 1930 totalled 666 million metric tons or 7% less than in 1929. The share of Great Britain in this total decreased by approximately 14-g- million metric tons, while in Germany the output, including the coal equivalent of lignite, decreased by 30 million metric tons and that of^Poland by 9 million tons. Production in France however was on the same level as the previous year While the production in Belgium increased by ir million tons,  that of Holland by   -J million tons and that of Russia by approximately 6 million tons.A comparison with the year 1913 indicates in a striding manner the lost ground which Great Britain has still to make good in contrast to other producing countries in Europe. British output wao no less than 44-g- million tons below the 1913 level, but Germany shews an increase of.21 million tons, France, Holland and Russia each record an increase of 10 million tons while Belgium shows an increase of 4-g- million tons.
The demand for coal was on a lower scale generalljr than in 1929.     France is a notable exception in this respect while Holland maintained its 1989 position.     The following table which relates to coal only and does not take into account coke or lignite shows the position of some of the more important continental countries:-Production.   Exports.

The f.o.b. prices at Danzig which -were 17/3d per ton at the end of 1929 have fallen to ll/9d and ll/3d oer ton at the end of 1930.    These prices are unremunerative and the falling off in the tonnage sent to the Austrian Succession States by 35  has^reacted unfavourably on the financial position of the polish coal industry.Demand for coal in Germany declined by approximately 20 million tons in 1930 and British exports to that country were correspondingly affected as the following figures show:-exports from Great Britain to Germany^ 1,000 metric tons. ....... 5,454...____ 5,609....... 5,0051928 1929 1930It may be remarxed that the sales of the Rhenish-Vestphalian Coal Syndicate in what are called the contested districts fell from 30.2 million tons in 1929 to 24.2 million tons in 1930, thus showing a reduction of 2Q?b.     Sales in the uncontested districts on the other hand only dropped from 27.2 to 25.2 million tons,  a decrease of 7%.The exports of coal from Germany in 1929 totalled 26.8 million tons and In 1930 were nearly 2^ million tons less at 24,4 million tons.
Imports into France in 1930, which totalled 2&amp;jg million tons, showed an increase over 1929 of 1 million tons.    Imports from Great Britain increased by   million tons, imports from Germany remained at the same level while imports from the Netherlands increased by ^ million tons.Imports of coal into Italy amounted to 12i million tons, a decrease of about 1 million tons on the previous year&apos;s figure. The import-B from Great Britain at 7 million tons remained at the same level as in 1929 while imports from Germany declined by 1 million tons.While the position of the British coal   export trade was less favourable than in 1929 it must be &quot;borne in mind that a comparison with 1913 reveals more accurately the extent to which the British coal industry has lost ground on the world&apos;s markets. There has been a total reduction of 21 million tons, the share of the various markets in this reduction being as follows:-(in 1,000 tons).Exports to:	1913.	1929.	1930.	15,894.1	6,686.4	5,436.6	25,945.6	26,172.8	24,563.west Mediterranean ...	15,929,3	12,808.9	12,i77.4East Mediterranean ...	5,625.6	3,220.2	2,664e2Rest of Africa .......	1,972.4	1, 256.8	897.9	795.1	1,068.9	644-5N. &amp; 0.

The exports to Portugal at 1-^ million tons were approximately at the same level as in 1913.     On the other hand exports to Algeria increased from 1%. million tons in 1913 to Tg- million tons in 1930.The greater part of the reduction in exports to the Eastern Mediterranean was due td* the loss of the old Austria-Hungarian
H7 l\market of 1 million tons and decreased shipments of l^ million tons to Egypt.The increased shipments to North and Central America went chiefly to Canada and the United States in the shape of anthracite.     It is worthy of mention that in 1930 over 1 million tons were shipped to Canada as compared with only 94,000 tons in 1913.In the South American region the Chilean market has !practically disappeared resulting in a loss of   million tons as compared with 1913.     Shipments to the Argentine shewed a decrease of 1 million tons and those to Brazil and Uruguay decreases of -g- million tons.The average f.o.h. price of British coal exported in l950was;1 16s. 7.73d. as compared with 16s.-1.61d. in 1929 and 13s.10d.in 1913.      The 1930 figure is 20% above the 1913 level and 37% above the 1909/13 level.ii&apos;aInland consumption in Great Britain in 1930 is estimated at   li 166i- million tons compared with 173^ million tons in 1929 and 1831 million tons in 1913.     A large part of this reduction in consumption is due to decreased activity in the iron and steel industry in 1930 when the output of pig iron was only 6,196,800 tons as compared with 7,579,500 tons in 1929 and the output of crude steel 7,298,500 tons as against 9,654,700 tons in the year before.     As approximately 2 tons of coal are required for the manufacture of each ton of pig iron and between 3 and 4 tons of    j coal for the manufacture of a ton of crude steel the inevitable reaction on the coal industry of such a large reduction in production of iron and steel is very apparent.IThe position of the principal districts in relation to output is shown in the following table:-Output of Saleable Coal Raised in 1929.,and..l950^1929, 1950.	tons.		5o of total.		tons.

In Great Britain the figure is 9/8^d, in the Ruhr 9/0d and in Poland 4/lld.
On the 1st December, 1930, the German railways introduced greatly reduced rates on German coal for export with a view to assisting the German coal industry.      The new rates to Bremen and Hamburg are 3/5d and 4/5d respectively and are practically only one half of the rates according to the general tariff. The wages in the Ruhr have been reduced 6$ by an arbitration award on the 10th January, 1931.In Belgium wages have been reduced by approximately 14$ since July 1930 while railway rates on Belgian coal have been reduced by approximately 25%.These and other measures taken by foreign competitors of this country together with the increase in costs involved in the readjustment of hours in Great Britain have considerably weakened the competitive power of the British industry at a time  &apos; when industrial depression has rendered the markets more acute and revived the discussion of international agreements.COTTON.Extract from Report handed in by MR. LENNOX LEE:-The closing of weaving mills soon reflected itself in the demand for yarns although considerable support was received by an increa.se in the purchases of medium and fine counts of yarn for the Continent, by speculative purchases by manufacturers at home,   and by good business from the few weaving mills which are still running.On the cloth side the maiting-up trade has placed some useful orders especially for heavy goods and prints, and the Continent has been a better buyer..with some moderate orders for stock lots of finishing cloths.In the piece dyeing trade, whilst a few plants have been well employed on orders placed two or three months ago for Hongkong, conditions have generally been dull.Although there was rather more than the usual seasonal increase in the output and deliveries over December in the Bleaching section,  receipts of cloth were &quot;barely up to the same level and the outlook for the immediate future has not improved, having regard particular^ to the position in the manufacturing branch of the industry.The slight improvement in the printing department of the trade recorded in December was not maintained during   January, and, although a few firms have continued to be fairly well employed, orders have on the whole been very limited and, as in other sections of the trade, - difficulties have arisen over delivery dates which have hampered business.The United Eingdom exports of cotton piece goods during 193C to India were about half the quantity as compared with 1929. Although there were other contributory causes (e.g. new Tariffs, impoverishment of the agricultural workers by the fall in price of agricultural produce , and the fall in the price of silver) the decrease is largely due to the Boycott.Exchange difficulties have hampered business with the Argentine and Brazil.     Stocks are reported to be low in Buenos Aires but, with a drop in the Peso from 43  d. to 33 d. during the last 12 months Dealers have not been prepared to &quot;buy. except
in small quantities,    some improvement is reported from Colombia and importers report increased sales during the last two or three months.     The Nitrate position is affecting the import trade of Chili and a large number of failures are reported amongst the smaller dealers.GENERAL .Handed in by MR. LENNOX LEE trade depression continues, but a slightly more optimistic feeling is beginning to prevail regarding the future.    Whether there is any solid foundation for this diminution in pessimism it is too early to say.     Prices are still falling, and the outflow of gold to Franco has had an unsettling effect on the money market.Labour disputes and wage negotiations are other disturbing factors, while the divergence between Wholesale and Retail prices makes it clear that we are still a long way from readjustment.A similar condition of affairs, however, exists in the other industrial countries, so that, except for the fact that British prices were out of adjustment with World prices even before the slump, we   are in no worse position than most of our competitors.Conditions in the coal trade have been far from satisfactory during the past month.   The volume of trade available has been small, with very few forward transactions passing.     Attempts to regulate production at the Pits in accordance with the marketing schemes have been made.    It is reported that demand has fallen short of expectations and as output is rather in excess,.stocks have again become excessive.      Operations in the Northumberland and Durham areas have been quiet, and there are no indications of any early improvement in the markets of those districts.   New business continues to be small and as a result it appears that further &quot;Short Time&quot; will be inevitable in the near future. In the Lancashire district the demand for house coal remains steady.    Owing to the stoppage in the cotton industry there are large quantities of slack and fuel on offer, and stocks at the collieries are increasing rapidly.    Industrial demand has varied from district to district, but as in certain areas many of the consuming industries are on &quot;short time&quot;, deliveries have been practically   negligible during the month.The general condition of the boot and shoe trade has shown little change during the month.-    A few firms are reported to be fairly active, with rather more work in hand than in recent weeks, but others have suffered a further set-back.    In the provincial areas business has been very quiet, but those supplying the large stores are receiving numerous encmiries for Spring products.The position in the chemical trade has not altered materially during the month, and while there is a certain amount of business passing, it is only on a limited scale.
* W ASome improvement was registered in the condition of the hardware trade during January.     It is satisfactory to recort that for the third year in succession a Birmingham manufacturer of Safety Razor Blades has secured the contract to supply the whole of the British Army with Safety Razors and Blades, despite severe competition.   Makers of edge tools report some increase in demand from the home market, but unfortunately this improvement has not extended to the export markets.    The cutlery industry also reports a slight improvement, a number of fir^s having booked fair orders, which will keep their works active for some time to come.     The total output of cutlery, however, is still considerably below capacity, and certain firms are finding It difficult to keep their plant active, even for short periods.The position of the cotton industry throughout the month has been dominated by the stoppage.   As a result the market has been made very difficult in the weaving section of the trade.     A fair amount of enquiry for cloth has been coming forward from abroad, but progress has been impossible owing to the delivery questions.    Home trade orders have been rather more numerous, but are mostly for small quantities.   A number of orders have been arranged for the Continent, although they have been confined to specialised lines.     In the yarn department, spinners of American counts have found the situation growing worse.     Increasing numbers of mills have been compelled to stop owing to the absence of fresh demand. On the Egyptian side the brightest feature has been the demand for the Continent of both single and double yarns.Conditions in the raw wool market have improved somewhat of late, prices at the London auctions being rather more firm. The tone of the yarn section has improved, spinners being reported to have refused to accept the low offers which have been so prevalent in recent weeks.     Business in coating counts has improved of late, and there has been rather more activity in yarns for the dress trade.     In the crossbred section new business is still somewhat scarce.     In the piece-goods section enquiries have been coming forward more freely,and orders although still small are more numerous.INDIAN TRADE.MR.

Imports of private merchandise were valued at Rs.18,478 lakhs, compared with Rs.24,861 lakhs in 1929 and an almost equal, figure in 1928.     Exports, including re-exports, amounted to Rs.25,709 lakhs, compared with Rs.32,389 lakhs in 1929 and Rs.33,803 lakhs in the previous year.      Imports from the United Kingdom were Rs.7,435 lakhs, compared with Rs.10,551 lakhs in the previous year and Rs.11,459 lakhs in 1923.     Exports to this country fell to Rs.5,592 lakhs, against Rs.6,831 lakhs and Rs.7,209 lakhs in the previous two years.     There can be no doubt that when every allowance is made for general economic factors the boycott movement has had a serious effect upon our trade with India, especially in cotton piece-goods.      In the eight months frOm April to November last our shipments of various descriptions fell, in comparison with the same period of 1929, as follows:-   Twist and ;,a rn from roughly 14^ million pounds to under seven million?    grey (unbleached; piece-goods from 3194; million yards to little more than 129 million yards: white (b3e ached) from 290 million yards to 172 million yards; coloured printed or dyed from 192 million yards to 122 million yards;    fents from 8f million yards to under two million yards. It may be added that the net imports of gold during 1930 were Rs.1,580 lakhs, of silver Rs.1,225 lakhs, and of currency notes Rs.lS lakhs.      The total visible balance of trade in favour of India was Rs.4,551 lakhs, compared with Rs.5,397 lakhs in the previous year.     The balance of remittances of funds was minus Rs.550 lakhs,  compared with minus Rs.3,302 lakhs in the previous year.
Indian Trade and Price Levels.The statistical comparisons between India&apos;s overseas trade in the last calendar year and 1929 given in these columns on Thursday are less depressing when expressed in percentages.     The figures given show that in 1930 the value of India&apos;s total export trade fell by 22 per cent., and that of her import trade by 26 per- cent.      It has been ascertained that Indian, wholesale price levels (applied to a very wide range of commodities) fell on the average by 18 per cent, during the year.      Thus the falling off in the trade figures is very largely due to lower prices.     Forty per cent, of the transactions were with the United Kingdom, representing a fall of 2 per cent.      The United Kingdom took 21.75 -per cent, of India&apos;s total exports, corn-pared with 21 per cent,  in 1929.      The boycott movement undoubtedly had a detrimental effect, but its significance should not be exaggerated.NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON sent the following report:-Copper.    Very little business is being done at present. Most firms are covered for two or three months against orders placed in the late autumn, and no new orders are coming forward necessitating the purchase of any prompt metal.Tin.    After a disappointing start, the demand has gradually recovered and is now about 75^ of normal.Lead^   Conditions are still dull:    but Birmingham anticipate that building programmes will shortly be resumed, and some recovery in the demand for pipe and Sheet should be seen.Spelter.    There is very little activity to report.      The galvanising trade in the Black Country shows no sign of early revival, and the recent imposition of a heavy import duty in India will still further postpone recovery.      Swansea states that only two out of eight firms in that area are working at the moment.MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS sent the following report:-1. In the Home Trade,  conditions still afford grounds for considerable apprehension.      Though the demand for the smaller type of cars is probably in excess of that ruling twelve months ago, there seems a definite slackening of enquiry for others.      Certain factories are fully employed but dealers generally report growing difficulties, and though certain models are selling freely, the general demand is not up to the expectations of agents throughout the country.
2.    Commercial vehicle trade is still affected by the new regulations as applying both to heavy goods vehicles and,  more p * rticulaTly,  to hackney vehicles,,    There is a fail&apos; demsnd for the lighter types, but competition continues to be very keen.b.    Employment generally remains much the same as a month ago, but at the time when factories should be busy, unemployment figures, very considerably higher than a year ago,  afford grounds for anxiety.4e    Export increases in difficulty.   Australian and New Zealand exchange difficulties, combined with continued liquidation of American stocks at bankrupt prices in all markets, intensify anxieties.    The British small car, however, is obtaining a growing goodwill, and the nroportion of British vehicles registered in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa is tending to improve.5.    There is a decreasing demand for foreign cars and trucks in the Home markete    The excess value of exports of all classes of motor nroducts over imports increased from  5,078,000 in 1929 to* V,270,000 in 1930, although the value of motor vehicles and pfrts exported decreased by some 15rf..    Imports decreased by no less than 45%BCOAL.Extract from report handed in by SIR WALTER RAINE:-It is regrettable to record th.:t with the exception of some of the very tip-top brands of Gas and Steam Coals, the Market has become quieter than it has been for several months past.    This refers chiefly to Coking Coals, and some of them can now be bought second-hand at a discount of from 3d to 4 i-d per ton.    This is no fault of the Exporter, but bimply that on the one hand the Colliery naturally wishes to deliver the Coals under these high-oriced Contracts,  and on the other hand, the Exporter,  in his eagerness to keep old established connections,  is being obliged tT take even below the minimum.Another matter to which I have referred in my previous reports, is that owing to the action of the Quota, some of the best Collieries would not be able to satisfy the requirements of their foreign customers.   My Agent in Copenhagen informs me that a protest h- s been sent in to the Ministry of 3,-rines pointing out this very fact, and stating that if it is desired by the British people that Denmark should do everything she can to use British Coals,  it will be necessary for us to supply the quality and brand which is asked for in each instance.RUSSIA:-   I referred to this matter at your November meeting,  and subsequently sent you a memorandum.    Reports reach me almost daily from people in different parts of the country, intimately connected with the Chambers of Commerce, that they are viewing with even greater&apos;alarm than ever before the uneconomic prices at which &quot;Russia is pouring various commodities into this country.    I do not know whether you have perused the Reoort of the soeeches made at
-i.       h*the Council of the International Chamber of Commerce on December 5th,    If not, I should like to cell your attention to the soeecl.es of Sir Arthur Balfour, Bart, and Cir Felix Schuster, Bsrt.    Both these gentlemen hold resTonaible positions,  and vould not s-ieak without careful reflection, but more important even thrn their speeches, is one m?de by &quot;.v, c.E. Strawn, Chairman of the American &quot;&quot;ational Committee,  ?nd Vice-President of the International Chamber of Commerce.I em, of course, not attempting to support any of the usual alarmist Reports in the newspapers - although there is no doubt that there xaxxst be a great deal of truth even in their statements, but we cannot ;:.et away from the fact that the position Is very serious, and I do think that it is time some active steps were taken to obtain incontrovertible proof how far these reports are true, and if there is a fair degree of correctness about them, drastic sction ought to be taken, even to the extent of absolute prohibition on Russian Imports until such time as that country is ready to produce and manufacture under fair conditions.EN0IT1jSERING9MR. ROWLAND sent the following report:-The general situation.Since these notes v;ere last written,  the trade and other returns In respect of December have become available and we have been able to compile complete data and definite totals for the year 1930,    But the ascertainment of these statistics does not to any material degree alter the provisional survey which was included in these notes last month, and as 1 ter statistics for January : re not yet available, we append on this occasion the Statistical Section of the January 1931 issue of the B.E.A. Bulletin (pages 12 to 18 inclusive), containing the complete statistics and commentary on the year 1930 as affecting the engineering industry.As already stated, there are not yet to hand any published statistics in respect of the current year, but in any case the opening months of 1931, until at least the opening of the Budget, will continue to be a very perplexing and difficult time for all connected with industry.    The hope that taxation might be reduced is rather replaced by fear that it may yet be increased.    The great aim must be by whatever means, to reduce production costs so as to recover the lost ground in home and foreign markets.    Certain proposals towards this end have recently been submitted in Conference by the Engineering Employers to the Trade Unions concerned,, and further consideration has been adjourned until next month.Engineering Trade with South American Countries.In view of the forthcoming Exhibition at Buenos Aires and the visit of the Prince of Wales there, and also of the current political situations in Argentina and Brazil,,:it has been thought of interest to append two tables, one (A) showing in detail the relative engineering export trade from
Britain to the principal South American cuntries, and the second tshle (B) detailing the exports of machinery to the Argentine Republic.    The particulars in both tables are given in quantity a&quot;d in value for the two latest available yean.:, 1928 and 1929.   As might be expected, the first table (A) showb that we transact more engineering export trade with Argentina than with any other country in South America, but whereas exports to that country fell in 1929 compared with 1928, the trade with Brazil, Chile and Uruguay&apos;increased.    In all, about 9$ of our total exports of machinery to all parts of the world in 1928 went to South America, and approximately 4% of the total to Argentina alone.    The second table (B) showti thrt the bulk of the machinery exports to Argentina is represented by boilers, and boiler house plant, cranes and lifting machinery, electrical machinery, and various types of orime movers. It is apparent that our engineering trade with these South American countries, particularly the Argentine Republic, is valuable to us, and should be carefully protected&quot;and zealously fostered.Engineering Contracts.Appended will be found the usual list giving pcrticulars of the rn^re important contracts recently plrced with British firms.    The value of the order secured is also given, where it is stated.

Trade has opened up during the New Year extremely&quot;slowly in all classes of goods.     The decline in values of raw materials is now making itself felt fully in decreased turnover per dozen sold,  and this,  coupled with the writing down of whatever stocks are now left at high prices, will probably prove the manufacturers&apos; greatest difficulty during 1931,The trade in Ladies1 novelty outerwear continues good, provided a continued output of really good effects are put on the market almost weekly.Hose manufacturers complain increasingly strongly of the increasing importation of foreign made hose, produced under conditions which will never exist in this country,Nottingham.     The Underwear section is at present quiet, but buyers are beginning to shew interest in Summer wear ranges, and an improvement is hoped for.The brightest spots in the industry in this district are at present full fashioned Silk Hose and Children&apos;s Socks and three-quarter Hose.     Cashmere Hose,, considering the fact that the greater part of the season is over, the volume of business passing is moderately good.     In the half hose section, trade is quiet.
There is a good demand for Wool Bathing Costumes and Men&apos;s Pullovers.      In women&apos;s outerwear, business remains quiet.In the Export trade, business is distinctly sub-normal.Loughborough.     Trade in this district remains bad, worse than a month ago, and worse than a year ago.     Short time isstill being worked in all sections, tHinckley.     Conditions remain unchanged, - trade still being very bad.     The quantities of foreign made hosiery coming into the town in the &quot;rough&quot; to be merely finished and countered in Hinckley, are increasing considerablytMansfield.     Here again there is very little difference in the conditions prevailing last month.IRON AND STEEL.Mr. Walmsley handed in the following statements-	United Kingdom	Germany	Prance	Belgium	Luxembourg.
