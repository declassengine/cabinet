THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.OppyJJo^___XJCABINET.LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION - RICHMOND BXPBRIkE-NT. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum by the Secretary for Mines, suggesting the discontinuance of the experiment in low temperature carbonisation which the Gas Light and Coke Company (with Government assistance) have been carrying out at Richmond for the past two years.    I agree that nothing; is likely to be gained by continuing the experiment on a restricted basis.This matter has been discussed with the Treasury, who have raised no objection to the circulation of this memorandum.Board of Trade,2?th February, 1931..SECRET CP.62 (31)
i 0*5LOOI attach a memorandum which has been prepared in the Mines Department e?n the comm. :-rcial experiment in Low Temperature Carbonisation which the Gas Light and Coke Company have been carrying out at Richmond for the past two years.I have carefully considered the position after visiting Richmond and discussing the matter with Sir David Milne Watson, and I have reached the conclusion that it is better that the experiment should be brought to an end.If it had been possible to make an arrangement with the Gas Light and Coke Company under which the experiment could have been carried on intensively for a further period of three or four years under the direct supervision of the Mines Department assisted by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, I should have been prepared to give such an arrangement my fullest support.But in my talks with Sir David Milne Watson the proposition which he made was that,  if it would help the Government, he would be prepared to continue the experiment on the restricted basis indicated in the attached memorandum for a further period of 12 months.    He made it clear, however,  that he thought that his views at the end of that period would be the same as they were now.    In view of this I am satisfied that the Gas Light &amp; Ccke Company have no real interest in the experiment,  and that no gsod purpose would be served in allowing it to continue on such a basis as was suggested by Sir David Milne Vatson.    The commercial results of such an effort cannot be otherwise than unsatisfactory, and, although the effect of closing the experiment may frem seme points of view be unfavourable to the low temperature carbenisation industry,  I am of opinion it is better to face this possibility now than leave the question over for another year.From the Government&apos;s point of view it is clear3y better to get out now.    I took the view at the time the arrangement with the Gas Light and Coke Company was made that the experiment was ill-
conceived, and it will &quot;be easier nov/ to place the blame for its failure where it should properly rest - on the late Government -than would be the case if we allow the experiment to be continued - under very unsatisfactory conditions - for another year.I have certain proposals under consideration which I hope in the near future to send forward for submission to the Cabinet by which I hope to counteract the adverse effect on the industry which the closing of the Richmond experiment may produce, and I should oropose to make it clear when announcing the Governments decision that this does not mean that the Government is not concerned to assist the development of this new industry in other ways.It is necessary that an early decision should be obtained as the present agreement with the Gas Light and Coke Company comes to an end on the 28th February and there are certain legal formalities to be observed if the suggestion to discontinue the experiment is not accepted.B..

i o ?r 1.0 ^Memorandum by the Mines Department on the Commercial Experiment in Low Temperature Carbonisation of Coal at Richmond by the Fuel Production Company Limited, and the Gas Light and Coke Company.Larly in 1927 the Government made an arrangement with the Gas Light and Coke Company for the purpose of carrying out on a commercial scale an experiment in low temperature carbonisation of coal.     A subsidiary company of the Gas Light and Coke Company,  called the Fuel Production Company Limited, was formed for the purpose of carrying on the operations.     Under the provisions of the Trades Facilities Acts, 1921 - 1926, the Treasury guaranteed the interest and capital on a loan of  100,000 which the Fuel Production Company Limited undertook to raise.     The capita], was to be expended in the construction and equipment of the necessary buildings and plant.      The Gas Light and Coke Company undertook to provide until the 31st December, 1930* a site free of all rent and other outgoings and agreed to act as managers of the experiment, providing all the costs of running the plant and taking all the proceeds obtained from the disposal of the products.     The accounts of the Company were to be open to inspection by the Mines Department.It was hoped originally that the plant could be erected and in working order soon after the end of 1027, so that there would have been a period of three years for the operation of the plant.     Actually the plant was not completed until the beginning of 1929.     Operations were -started on the 7th February, 1929, which meant that rather less than two years was left of the period covered by the agreement with the Company,* The agreement was subsequently extended to the 28th February? 1931, to give time to consider the future of the experiment,,
The plant was closed down entirely for ah out 3-g- months in the second half of 193Q and has at no time been in full operation.     At the present time only 8 retorts out of 40 are being worked.Accounts have been furnished by the Company for the periods 7th February to 30th June, 1929;    1st July to 31st December,  1929;    and for the half year ended 30th June, 1930, and these indicate that the financial results of the experiment have been disappointing.The plant has a normal capacity of 120 tons a day through-put.     The Gas Light and Coke Company assess this at 31,300 tons per annum, allowance being made by them for the time required for necessary repairs to the plant.     This annual throughput is calculated on the basis of about 260 days per annum,  and is presumably taken by the Company at this lov/ figure because of the difficulties which have been experienced in working the plant.     A more usual basis to take is 300 days per annum and on this basis the annual throughput would be 36,000 tons,In the 47 weeks of 1929 during which the plant was in operation, 15,650 tons of coal were carbonised,  or about half the amount which should have been c arbonised if the plant had been working full time, on the basis adopted by the Company, In the six months ended 30th June,  1930, the throughput was at the rate of 14,500 tons per annum.  ;The Gas Light and Coke Company have regarded the low. temperature plant as merely forming a part of their ordinary organisation and have expected it to stand or fall on that basisv     Some of the items of costs in the accounts appear prima facie to be high, but an examination of the accounts
4 C mX G 6indicates that the same basis  of costing has heen applied to the low temperature plant as is applied to any other part of the Company&apos;s organisation.     Had a more concentrated effort heen made to work the plant such as would usually be associated with a new enterprise,  it is probable that the financial results would have presented a more satisfactory appearance.      The Gas Light and Coke Company agree that If &quot;full time&quot; working had been possible the loss which the accounts show would have been substantially reduced,Apart from this general explanation the main reasons for the disappointing results are -(1) The plant was of a new and untried design.     The experience gained has shown certain defects which can definitely be remedied, and others, which are referred to below,  which it is hoped can be remedied. (2) The staff was necessarily inexperienced in running the plant.(3) A market had to be created for the disposal of themain product - Gloco.     The Gas Light and Coke Company have followed the line of using its large organisation to secure sales over a wide area.     Many of the sales have been in very small lots and this has resulted in high delivery costs.     Sales did not, at first, keep pace with production, so that stocks accumulated.     As there was little storage room at the Richmond works the fuel had to be carted some distance away for storage,  thus adding to the working cost.     On the other hand there has been a steady improvement in the average gross price obtained for the Gloco as shown in the three periods covered by the accounts, and on the basis of the price obtained in London for &quot;Coalite&quot; another low temperature fuel it is believed
i 9%Jl. &apos;*Jthat still &quot;better prices might he obtained. Towards the end of last year the Company gave notice to terminate the agreement and in view of this the question of the. future of the experiment has been c are fully considered by the Mines Department and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.There appeared to be four alternatives to be considered? (1) To accept the notice of the Company to terminate the experiment and to close down the plant, (2) To endeavour to induce the Company to agree to an extension of the present arrangements for a further period.(3) For the Government to take over the plant and to place it under the control of the Fuel Research Station for use as a Government commercial experimental plant. (4) For the Government to take over the plant and run it themselves as a commercial experiment under the charge of a qualified Gas Engineer. As regards the first alternative,  there were,  in the view of both Departments,  strong reasons why the experiment should not be allowed to close down at this moment.     These were(l)  the Government would lose practically the whole of . the  100,000 which they guaranteed, without securing results which would be accepted as a reliable indication of the commercial possibilities of low temperature carbonisation.      Seeing that less than two years&apos; working on a restricted scale has been possible out of the period of three years originally contemplated,  the Government would not be justified in allowing the experiment to terminate in such an unsatisfactory
position,   if a proper arrangement for its continuance could be made;(2) low temperature carbonisation is now passing through a phase when it is generally recognised that the technical difficulties have to a large extent been overcome, and it is largely a question of establishing whether the industry can be developed economically on a commercial scale.     An association of undertakings working low temperature carbonisation processes on a commercial scale has recently been formed,   and efforts are being made to establish the new industry on a proper basis,     The closing of the Richmond plant at this stage might,   it was felt, convey the impression that the Government did not believe in the commercial possibilities of the process ;(3) the process which has been worked is substantially that which was evolved at the Government Fuel Research Station.     If the experiment closed down it might have an unfortunate effect on the work of the Fuel Research Station;(4) The Government were recently pressed by a joint deputation from the Trades Union Congress and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to adopt a more active policy in regard to this and allied aspects of the coal problem.As regards the second alternative,  the two Departments agreed that there was little in the results so far obtained to support a suggestion that the plant should be operated for a further period by the Gas Company, and accordingly it was felt that this alternative could only be supported in the event of the Government deciding that in the general
interests of the industry, the experiment ought to he continued, and it was not possible to make any more satisfactory arrangement.As to the third alternative,  the two Departments agreed that this was hardly likely to commend itself and need not be seriously considered,,     The main object of the Richmond experiment was to try out low temperature carbonisation on a purely commercial basis and any suggestion of departing from that basis would be open to serious criticism.There remained the fourth alternative, and it was this alternative which both departments considered should be adopted.It was agreed that the supervision of the experiment on the commercial side should be in the hands of the Mines Departmentft     It was considered essential that the help and guidance of the Director of Fuel Research should be available on all technical questions that may arise and it was proposed that Dr* Lander should act as Technical Adviser,Before the experiment could have been continued on&apos; a satisfactory basis it would have been necessary to have spent a sum of about  15,000 in re-conditioning the retorts, 16 of which are in such a bad condition owing to growth and distortion as to be unworkable and others would also have required to be replaced in the near future.In a report on the condition of the retorts which theDirector of Fuel Research supplied it was stated -&quot;Undoubtedly the main defect in the plant is the material of which the retorts are made,, which is liable to growth and distortion.     All the retorts at the Fuel Research Station of the materials used at Richmond have, sooner or later, given trouble from this cause. Overheating aggravates this trouble, and the inexperience of the staff combined with defects in the arrangements for heating, and measuring the temperatures,  resulted in overheating at an early stage. The effect of distortion is to increase the labour per retort and to diminish the throughput, both effects increasing the labour required per ton of coal treated.
vmm\mmm1 G1Other troubles have been due to excessive heat on the working level at the top of the retorts, and to minor points, some of which have been put right.Should the new retorts now under trial at the Fuel Research Station prove as satisfactory as is hoped,  it should be possible to recondition the Richmond plant in the light of the experience gained at a cost of some  15,000.    The retorts should then be capable of treating 160 tons a day of suitable coal, or on the basis of 300 days a year, 48,000 tons per annum,&quot;Even after the reconditioning of the plant it would not have been possible to say that the experiment would be a commercial success, but it was the considered opinion of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and of the Mines Department that under proper management a considerable improvement over past results could be obtained.    Having examined the accounts furnished by the Company,  the two Departments prepared estimates as set out in the Statement attached showing the probable results (l) on the basis of working during the first year using such of the retorts as are now workable and (2) on the basis of working which would be possible when the plant had been reconditioned.There is also included in the statement the estimate by the Gas Light and Coke Company of the results which they considered they would have obtained cn a &quot;full time&quot; working basis.In order to keep the market for the Gloco, itwas considered essential that there should be a continuousproduction of this fuel and accordingly the reconditioningof the plant which was necessary would have to be carried outin stages.    This would have meant that during the first year of working under the new arrangement the plant would onlybe operated on a restricted scale with a throughput of coalof about 15,000 tons per annum,  or at about the same level asthe Gas Company had secured.-9-
f 0 9i- ij WThe estimated results of the operations under the new arrangement indicated that the loss per ton of coal carbonised might be as much as 10/- during the first year and 5/- during the subsequent period.    It was thoughtj however,   that it should be possible to improve on these figures and that there was a possibility when once experience of full time working was obtained of reducing the loss to very small proportions.On the basis shown in the Statement it would have been necessary to provide a sum of  7,500 to cover the loss in working and a further sum of,  say,  2,500 for working capital.    This would be in addition to the sum of  15,000 required to recondition the plant, making for the first year a total of  25,000.    .?or subsequent years it was estimated that a sum of from  10,000 to  12,000 might be required and it was proposed that the experiment should he carried on for a period of from three to five years. Within this period it would,  in the opinion of both Departments have been possible to fix with some precision whether low temperature carbonisation could be operated with financial success and,  if so, under v/hat conditions -which was the original object of the Government in guaranteeing the loan of  100,000*3efore the proposal that the experiment should be continued under Government supervision could be adopted it was necessary to secure the concurrence of the Gas Light and Ooke Company.The important considerations from t he Government&apos;s point of view were the use of the site at Richmond at a reasonable rental and an undertaking by the Gas Company to take the gas produced at the same figure as that at which it has been credited in the accounts hitherto.
When first approached Sir David Ivlilne Watson did not appear to rule out the possibility of coming to a suitable arrangement, hut in subsequent discussions he intimated that his Board had come to the conclusion that it would not be possible to make arrangements which would permit the Government to take over and run the plant.      He mentioned two main difficulties which had led to this decision being reached (l) as the Low Temperature Carbonisation plant is substantially an integral part of the gas works it would be impracticable to have two sets of workpeople and two managers working on the same premises,(2) within a maximum period of two years his Board proposed to reconstruct the gas works and they could not therefore part with the control of the site for the period contemplated by the Departments.In the course of the final discussion Sir David Milne Watscn said that if it would help the Government he would be prepared to continue to work the plant as at present, that is with 8 retorts out of the 40, for1&apos;, a further priod of 12 months, but he made it clear that his present views were not likely to be changed as a result of this further period of working-    His Company would be prepared to bear any loss on running costs us they were now doing provided the Government would forego the interest on the loan of  100,000.(The interest on the loan has been paid up to the present out of the  100,000).    He added that if during the course of the twelve months a new retort became available or there were some other substantial development v/hich could not now be foreseen and it appeared as a result of this that there was a reasonable prospect pf producing at Richmond on a commercial basis all the gas required by the Company at Richmond,  the Gas Light and Coke Company might be willing to discuss with the Government the terms onwhioh they would continue the experiment beyond the period of twelve months.
From the point of view of securing any informatioa which is likely to be of value to the Government or the industry a continuance of the experiment on this basis offers little or no hope.     The reasons mentioned above,  in the consideration of alternative No.l, against the closing down of the experiment are substantial, and if it had been practicable to make a proper arrangement for its continuance, they would have furnished ample justification for going on.Another factor which has recently come into the picture needs to be mentioned.      The South Metropolitan Gas Company have erected a plant at their gas works at Greenwich which when in full operation will have a throughput capacity of 300 tons a day - or more than twice the capacity of Richmond.     The process to be used is the Parker producing Coalite as the low temperature fuel.     The plant has recently begun to work with one battery of retorts. The Company have gone into venture without any Government financial assistance and Dr. Carpenter, the Chairman of the Company, is believed to be anxious to give the experiment a fair trial.     There are two other commercial plants in the Midlands also working the Parker process one of which has been running for 3 years and the other for l-g- years.      These plants are being operated by Low Temperature Carbonisation Limited which owns the rights in the Parker process.     No dividends have yet been paid on the ordinary shares of this Company and from discussions which have taken place with representatives of the Company it seems clear that the stage of production on an economic basis has not yet been reached.     The development at Greenwich by the South Metropolitan Gas Company is therefore an important one and it may partly account for Sir David Milne Watson&apos;s suggestion of helping the Government by keeping alive the Richmond experiment.     If the Greenwich plant is successful it is conceivable that the Gas Light and Coke Company might rebuild
1 0!XJt. w&apos; wthe Richmond Gas Works as a low temperature instead of a high temperature works, hut they v/ill need something striking to c o nv inc e them.The position is one of some difficulty and in view of the considerations involved appears to call for a decision hy the Cabinet.
