These conclusions, embodied in paper CP, 429(30), were as follows:-(1) All questions which relate exclusively to Agricultural policy in England, Wales and Scotland, to be referred for consideration to the Cabinet Committee appointed on the 10th December &quot;to formulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a polio:/ for carrying out the statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchoqtier in the House of Commons on August 1st&quot;.(2) This Committee to be known as theAgricultural Development Committee, and its membership&quot; to be enlarged by the addition of the First Lord of tho Admiralty and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.Tho membership of the Agricultural DevelopmentCommiittoe accordingly consist:-,
The Home&apos; Secrc-etary (Chairman) The Lord Privy seal the Minister of AgTtecibfcmr-e       M&amp;.b art*edi The President of the Board    of Trade The First Lord of the Admiralty The Secretary of State for Scotland and The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.It was also agreed that any question relating to Home Agricultural policy which might he under consideration at the present time by Committees of the Cabinet should be referred by those Committees to the Agricultural Development Committee.3. At a Meeting of the &apos;Ottawa Committee1   on the26th January last that Committeein pursuance of the Cabinet Conclusions recited above, remitted to the Agricultural Development Committee the question of the Home Wheat Quota raised in three Memoranda which had been circulated to the &apos;Ottawa Committee&apos;  by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.4. The Agricultural Development Committee now submit to the Cabinet the following Report on their examination of the Home Wheat Quota scheme.Report.5. On the 1st August 1930,  the Chancellor of theExchequer announced in the House of Commons the Govern-menfs Agricultural policy,  the terms of which had beenapproved by the Cabinet on the 51st July (Cabinet 48 (30)Conclusion l) .    The passage in this announcement dealingwith cereals reads as follows&quot;: -&quot;The critical position of cereal farmers demands the earliest possible attention.      The question of the condition of this class of agriculturists in different parts of the Empire will be discussed at the forthcoming Imperial Conference;, with special reference to Bulk Purchase,  Import Boards and Stabilisation of prices,,    In view of this, aad of the possibility that
the conclusions of the Conferoneo on this matter may materially change the practical problem of dealing with cereal farming,  the Government is not in a position at present to formulate comprehensive proposals for this part of the agricultural situation beyond the plans outlined in thi-s statement for improved methods of cultivation, the better organisation and marketing of produce,  education and research, and improved credit facilities.    But as soon ag the conclusions of the Imperial Conference are known,  the Government will undertake whatever practicable steps can be devised to put cereal growing in this country on an economic foundation&quot;.Hansard Vol.  242c No,  189 Colu  088-091.6. In considering a policy for carrying out this pledgwe have borne in mind that the Cabinet has already decided (as regards agricultural policy)  &quot;that no proposal that involved cither a crude subsidy or protective tariffs could be considered&quot; (Cabinet 14 (30) Conclusion l).    We have,  therefore,  confined our attention to the only proposal for assisting cereal cultivation in this country of which we are aware (apart from Import Boards) which does not involve either of these expedients, viz,    the home wheat quota plan.7. It is relevant to recall that wheat quota proposalssubstantially in the present form, were considered by aY/heat Quota Committee of the Cabinet appointed in pursuanceof Conclusion 1 of Cabinet 43 (30),  consisting of;-The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries The Home Secretary The First Lord of the Admiralty The Secretary of state for Scotland and The President of the Board of Education.That Committee concluded (subject to a reservation by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty)  that &quot;whilst recognising itslimitations they r ecommend ed -(1) the adoption of the principle of the quota scheme
for home-grown wheat of milling quality as an emergency measure in view of the very serious position of arable farming,  on the condition that it is accompanied Toy the establishment of a Wheat Marketing Board charged with the marketing of quota wheat&quot;.    (CP.  272 (30)).8. We attach (Appendix)  the three documents which theMinister of Agriculture hac circulated to us on the proposedHome and Dominion Wheat Quota Scheme.    The first document,marked &quot;A&quot;, contains a general description of the scheme,the second, marked &quot;B&quot; deals with a number of questionswhich have from time to time been raised in regard to homequota proposals, and the third, marked &quot;C&quot; contains the headsof a draft Bill.    It will of course be understood that thisReport is only concerned with the home quota proposals,which are independent, as regards policy, of those for a dominion quota0    While under this scheme the Dominionquota is not an essential adjunct to the Home quota,  theconverse is not true,  since it would be politicallyimpracticable to grant a wheat quota to the Dominion and notto the Home producer.We are advised that the proposals do not involve.&apos; jany breach af the obligations of the United Kingdom under      1 existing international commercial treaties. \j9. It will be observed that in effect the scheme providesthat home flour millers shall be required under statute to purchase (though not necessarily grind) a quota (fixed from time to time in accordance with circumstances)  of home-grown wheat of milling quality, flour importers being placed under a corresponding obligation.10. After very careful consideration of the proposals, wehave reached agreement with regard to the questions mentioned in paragraphs 11 to 19 below.11. The Home Wheat Quota Scheme has been drawn up by representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
the Board of Trade and the Board of Customs and Excise xthe light of previous discussions with the agricultural.., milling, flour importing, baking, and other trade interests concerned,,    While it is inevitable thu.t administrative diffi-culties must arise in the operation of a scheme of this no?el and far reaching character, we are prepared to accept the assurances of the Minister of Agriculture end Fisheries and the President of the Board of Trade that thQse difficulties can be overcome and that the scheme is a workable one-      We have also reason to think that the Government of Northern Ireland will consider sympatheticalls&apos;&apos; the question of introducing concurrent legislation.IS.      We have carefully examined the effect of a Home Wheat quota on flour and bread prices.    This will depend on the premium commanded by Home quota wheat over the world price for comparable wheat.      It is estimated that assuming a premium of 15/- per 480 lbs and a Home quota of 15 per csnt, the average increase in the cost of the miller&apos;s grist will be 2/3d per 480 lbso or an increase of about one farthing on the 4 lb. loaf.    We agree that this estimate is one which may be accepted.13.      The proposal for a Home wheat quota is put forward on the ground that the decline in wheat prices in recent years has already caused a further serious reduction of the arable area of England and Wales,  depriving many thousands of farm workers of their employment and bringing large numbers of farmers over a wide area in Eastern England into serious financial difficultyo      The best means of checkang the movement is to be found in a higher price for wheat which is the kcy^ crop of the arable area.14,      In this connection it may be observed that a compari-son of 1922 (the last year of high oorn prices) with 1930, shows a reduction of arable area in England and Wales of 13 per cent,  and in Scotland of 7jr per cent, a reduction
in England and Wales of the wheat area of 51 per cent, and in Scotland of the oats area of 12 per cent, and a reduction of farm labourers (from 1921 figures)  of (England and Wales)  14-y per cent,  * 127,PO0 persons,  and of (Scotland)  10 per cento r: 13,000 persons.15. The scheme now before us contemplates that theprice for Home wheat of milling quality should be fixed at such a figure as will tend to maintain, but not substantially to increase,  the present wheat acreage. The tendency for agricultural workers to leave the land is increasing, and it is of importance from the point of view both of employment and of maintaining a stable balance in agricultural economy that it should be arrested,16. It haa been represented to us that the grant tothe wheat farmer of the valuable benefits under the scheme must inevitably have repercussions on other cereals,  such as oats and barley (which might involve a demand for a subsidy on those crops) and possibly on other raw material and other products.      In this connection we have been re-minded that at the time of the Corn Production legislation it was thought necessary to give a guarantee in respect of oats as well as wheat.    The total area in the United Kingdom then under wheat was approximately only half the area devotedto cats. To show the magnitude of possible commitments itlastshould be cotod that in 1921/22 the/year when the Corn Production Acts were in operation, out of a total subsidy of nearly  19 millions about  6 millions, was paid in respect of wheat and  12 millions in respect,of oats.
17* If -tiLe-.vHom^-l?bjea-t--Quota..Scheme is &quot;bronglft. into opei^txon.^ demands   may be made in., respect of other cereals for similar treatment.    Indeed such a. claim has already been made on behalf of the Scottish oat growers (see following paragraph),   Tho Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries considers that so far as England and Wales are concerned, a demand for similar - treatment In respect of fcther cereal crops can be resisted, and special treatment for wheat defended, by reference to the exceptional circumstances of British wheat production and to the fact that wheat is a hoy erop in agricultural economy.    This important issue is one which only the Cabinet can determine,    %n any case we are satisfied that it would bo &quot;impossible to apply aJ quota scheme to oats, and most difficult to applyjBuch a\ scheme to malting barley.18, The Secretary of State for Scotland has explained tous that Scotland is a wheat growing country to a much less extent than England, end has estimated that under the proposals Scottish wheat growers would only obtain about one-twentieth part of the advantage gained by the English farmer.    In Scotland the key cereal crop is oats and the Scottish agricul-tural interests have, in tho view of the present severe depression of prices duo in their viow to foreign dumping, proceed for the institution of some system of import licenses or prohibition of importc19o While Mr. Adamson is in favour of the Wheat Quotasehfjmo, he only assents to its adoption provided that some equivalent benefit is granted to the Scottish farmer., . He has submitted to us certain proposals, one of which contemplates the payment by the Exchequer to Scotland of financial compen-sation to the amount of  100,000 -  150,WOO for every 5/- of the spread between the world price and the Home wheat quota
price, the compensation to he used in various ways to benefit Scottish agriculture.     We hope to deal with the Scottish proposals in our next Report.20., T/e assume that the Cabinet desire our views not .onlyon the question whether the scheme is a workable one, but also   a whether it is one which it is desirable and expedient to bring into operation.    On the latter question, which raises, of course political issues of the first importance which can only be determined by the Cabinet, we have failed to reach agreement. 21. The Coramittees with the exception of the Firfft lord ofthe Admiralty and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury,take the view that the political and other objections whichcan be brought forward, against the proposals are outweighed by the economic and other advantages which will accrue to arable farming under the scheme022. Those of us who take this view fully admit that theproposals are open to the criticism that in prosent circumstances they involve a slight increase in the price of b?jead.    In this connection, however,  it is important to remember that this spread will tend to disappear as the price of home-grown wheat -approximates more closely to the world price,  in othor words, the consumer pays moat in respect of this scheme when the price cf wheat is lowest.    Moreover,  if the Government are to redeem their pledge and &quot;put cereal growing in this country on an economic foundation&quot; and if remedies such as &quot;protective tariffs&quot; &apos;c.c.&amp; &quot;crude subsidies&quot; are to be ruled outs we can see no other solution of the British wheat problem than that the consumer should be asked to meet the difference between the world and homepriceso    This sacrifice on the part of the consumer will, it is confidently hoped, arrest the decline in wheat cultivation and the steady growth of unemployment referred to in paragraphs 13-16 above..,      The scheme before us has also the definite merit;, from a National standpoint&quot;., that it will conduce to improved technique in the production and marketing of the home wheat crop.
25. It is vu?ged that the proposals involve a &quot;breach ofthe Free Trade principles of the Labour Party.     It appears to us that precisely the some criticism could be directed against the policies of Import Boards and Bulk purchase, both of which figure in the party&apos;s political programme, and both of which might, if adopted, involve, on occasion, the payment by the consumer of a price higher than the current world price.^2-vv24o It has also been urged against the Home Quota scheme that its adoption would necessarily commit the Government to acceptance of the Dominion Quota schemee25v &quot;vie do not accept this view, but in any case wewould point out that at the Imperial Conference - the representativesof the Dominions made it clear that they were concerned only tosecure a definite percentage of the home market, and thatthey did not ask for any preference as regards price, indeed they themselves agreed that the Dominion fruota scheme should -cease to operate if their wheat rose above the world price.In any case we consider that adequate protection againstartificial Dominion prices will be afforded by the fact thatthere is a large balance of Dominion supplies which could be diverted to this country.26. The only other important criticism of thescheme is that relating to its possible reactions on other cereals,.      In addition to the observations in paragraph 17 above, a majority of the Committee agree with the minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in the view that if the case for a Wheat Quota is established on its merits, it ought
not to be rejected merely &quot;because of its possible repercussions on other commodities.87. Having regard to these considerations amajority of the Committee,  consisting of the Chairman, the Lord Privy Seal,  the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,  the President of the Board of Trade, and the Secretary of State for Scotland   have agreed to advise the Cabinet to proceed with the Home Wheat Quota proposal as a fulfilment in part of the government s pledge in regard to cereal cultivation and accordingly recommend tho Cabinet:- ^To approve tho Home Wheat Quota &quot;\uscheme as set out in the Appendix -to this Report,  and to authorise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to arrange for tho preparation of a draft Bill to give jlegislative effect to the scheme. //28. The views of the First Lord of the Admiralty andthe Financial Secretary to the Treasury are sot out inthe following paragraph.Reservation by the First Lord of the Admiralty and ihe Flnancia1 Secretary to  the Treasury.29. We do not consider that the advantages claimed forthe scheme are sufficient to outweigh tho objections to its adoption.    It is exceedingly doubtful whether the Scottishoat growers will be content with an Exchequer grant to theDepartment of Agriculture for the benefit of Scottishagriculture generally as an equivalent for the benefits tobe given to English Wheat growers and much larger demandsthan those now put forward by tho Secretary of State forScotland are likely to be made upon the Exchequer, not only from Scotland but from English oat growers which might bedifficult to resist.      It would,, moreover, be a dangerous    .s Note,  Subject to the qualification regarding an equivalent benefit for Scotland mentioned in paragraph 13 above.
principle to admit that, if an ? price is secured by the scheme to the wheat grower at the ? of the consumer, corresponding grants must be given by the taxpayer for the benefit of other branches of agriculture.

We feel bound also to dissent from the scheme on general political grounds. Although the increase in the price of bread may not be considerable, the scheme is open to the charge that it raises the price of all the flour supply, home and imported, by approximately 2/-per ?, and therefore taxes the consumer to that extent. In our judgment this concedes to Conservative Protectionists and Empire Free Traders their case for raising the price of food to benefit either Home or Dominion producers.

In view of these considerations we are unable to resist the conclusion that acceptance of the scheme would involve the abandonment of the Party&apos;s main case against food taxes and of the key position of Free Trade.

(50) 7.COPY N09CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PROPOSED IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.AT OTTAWA.HOME AND DOMINION WHEAT QUOTA BILL.(Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries).1. In accordance with Minute No. 2(a) of the FirstMeeting of th^ Ottawa Committee of the Cabinet, I circulate herewith draft heads of a Bill, (0*C*(30)9) ana an  explanatory memorandum, (0.C .(30)8), which have been prepared in my Depart-ment, in consultation with representatives of the Board of Trade and the Board of Customs and Excises2* The Bill provides that millers and flour importersshall be required to purohase a minimum proportion or quota (i) of home-grown wheat, and (ii) of Dominion wheat and wheat flour.   The proposals under (i) which are now primarily the concern of the Agricultural Development Committee, are put forward in connection with the pledge given on behalf of the Government by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 1st August last.   This pledge was that ttas soon as the conclusions oftake whatever practicable steps can be devised to put cereal growing in this country on an economic foundation&quot;.     The proposals under (ii) are on the lines discussed by the Committee on Economic Co-operation of the Imperial Conference.the Imperial Conference are known, the government. I am advised that the proposals in the Bill donot Involve any breach of the obligations of the United
Kingdom under existing international commercial treaties. 4. It should be observed, that the home quotaproposals are entirely Independent of those for the Dominion quota as regards policy, and the Dominion quota is not essential to the administration of the Home Quota* 5. So far as the Home Wheat Quota is concerned,the plan while admitting of an enhanced price to home wheat producers, will, however, allow the United Kingdom to derive full benefit from the importation of grain or flour at low world prices, including what is termed *dumped1 or * subsidised&apos; wheat or flour.   The plan can therefore be fairly regarded as an attempt to find a solution of the hitherto irreconcilable points of view of those who desire to see some measure of protection (by a tariff) for   home wheat growers, and those who have resisted such a tariff, on the ground that it would raise the price of imported as well as home grown wheat and thus result in an unnecessary increase in the price of bread.6. The method of applying the ($iota is based ona system of approved certificates of origin for both home-grown wheat and dominion v/heat or flour?   The certificate system has many advantages over any other quota system ^hloh has been considered.   These advantages are indicated in the explanatory memorandum to which I Invite special attention. ?B The proposals put forward and included in theBill, have, so far as the home wheat quota la concerned, been arrived at after considering the views expressed last summer at the interviews which I had with representatives of the organisations of the milling and baking trades, of the National Farmers&apos; Union and of the agricultural merchants of England and Wales.   So far as the Dominion quota is concerned, the outline of the proposals has been laid before the Dominion
representatives oh the Committee on Economic Co-operation of the Imperial Conference, and the Committee *s Report thereon favoured further examination of the question. 8. The introduction of the home wheat quota isconditioned by the prior establishment of a producers&apos; wheat marketing board under the Agricultural Marketing Bill when enacted.   A Board is necessary so that an authoritative body would be responsible for regulating tne marketing of the home cropj so as to ensure that sufficient supplies of wheat are forth6oming in an orderly manner to meet quota requirements.   The Board would also be required to accept the responsibility for Issuing certificates of origin for homo grown wheat.9. It is contemplated that the home wheat quotawill be so fixed as to absorb all the available supplies of home wheat of milling quality.   The wheat marketing board will, therefore, be In a position to obtain for home wheat a price higher than the world price.   Consumers1&apos; interests will, however, be safeguarded by placing in the Bill a maximum price, which will have to be settled by the Govern-ment in due course.   The Minister will have no power to operate a quota for home wheat when the price exceeds this figure;    consequentially,, there will be no quota for Dominion wheat if the quota for home wheat is withdrawn. The maximum price suggested is calculated to maintain the present acreage under wheat rather than induce any marked extension.10. In order to provide the Minister with competentand disinterested advice, It is proposed to appoint a standing body of Wheat Commissioners to advise upon all aspects of administration-
11. Certain powers of control over flour and&quot;bread prices are provided in the Bill in order to Counter^ apt any possibility that the quota requirements might be used as an excuse for raising unduly the price of flour and bread on the part of millers and bakers respectively. This particular form of control may, however, be unnecessary irt ihe event of a Consumers1 Council Bill being passed. Finally/ by the enforcement of a definite standard of milling quality for home wheat it.will be possible to improve the technique of productionn and marketing in this country, whilst the establishment of a Wheat Marketing Board will provide the home wheat grower,, for the first time, with a comprehensive marketing organisation which will be fundamentally Interested in the smooth working of the quota scheme..12* In the Report of the Committee on economic co-operation of the Imps rial Conference, it was. suggested that the Dominion wheat quota should be somewhat in excess of the average annual imports of wheat from Dominions in recent years, which were not above 55$ of the total wheat imports of the United Kingdom.     The quantity of wheat represented by this percentage will constitute less than half of the total wheat exported from the Dominions at the present time, and the whole of those supplies will be available on the world wheat market for purchase by United Kingdom buyers..   There can, therefore, be no danger of the Dominions being in a position to demand a price from the United Kingdom buyers in excess of the world price, even if the crops In Canada and, Australia should be largely under the control of pools-     Provision is, however, made in the Bill for revoking the Dominion quota, if necessary, and the measure regarding the control of flour and bread prices
also apply.     The initial amount of the Dominion quota will presumably be the subject of negotiation with   the Dominions and thereafter be increased from time to time in proportion as the Dominions Increase their imports of United Kingdom goods*13. I invite special attention tc those paragraphs of the Explanatory Memorandum (O.C.(30)8) which deal with a number of questions that havo been raised in earlier discussions of the home quota scheme.     These Include -(i) the alternative system of requiring physical admixture of the quota of wheat by millers in every gristing,  (see para. 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum); (li) the use of quota certificates (para. 4)l (ill) the possible lcorneringT of \vheat or certificates (para8 5)J(iv) the effect of the Scheme in improving the technique of wheat growing and marketing in Great Britain *     See para. 14 and also Clause XII (o) of the Draft Bill, (v) the effect of the quota scheme on the prices of flour and bread (para. 15).(Initialled) C.A.nistry of Agriculture and Fisheries., 16th January, 1931o

The home quota and the dominion quota arenot interlocked;    the machinery for each can workindependently, but for obvious reasons the existenceof a dominion quota is, in the present proposals,made contingent upon the existence of a home quota.There is no administrative necessity, however,   tomake the existence of a home quota contingent uponthe existence of a dominion quota. j2. The present proposals have as theirprinciple, a requirement that home flour millersshall purchase  (though not necessarily grind)&quot;quotas&quot; of (1) home wheat and (2) dominion wheat.It is essential that the millers&apos; trade competitors,the flour importers,  shall be placed under acorresponding obligation.The requirement to purchase  (though not togrind)  the quota is the only quota system whichfulfils all tho following requirements:-(1) it is administratively practicable;(2) it can be so framed as to place all port and country millers on the same competitive level,(3) it can secure fair-play as between homemillers, flour importers and Dominion flour millers,and(4) it provides an offoctivo check against evils associated with, the   speculative practice of &quot;cornering&quot;.
9 nThe only alternative quota system for home wheat to that contain3d in the present proposals is a system which involves a physical admixture of homo wheat by millers in every gristing and a physical admixture of All-English flour by flour importers on every parcel of imported flour.Although this alternative has been favoured by the British flour millers,  it is open to tho following ,000&quot;-ious and Indeed overwhelming objections:-(i)  It is impossible to ensure that millers shall in fact grind the quota of home wheat in every gristing;    millers&apos; grist books are not conclusive evidence of the identity of the wheat used, especially if there is some pecuniary advantage to be gained by falsifying entries.    If a law cannot be enforced,  it should not be enacted.(II) The physical admixture proposal would involve the expense of transporting homo wheat for milling to many parts of Great Britain whore it is not ordinarily milled at present.(iii) Flour importers would be put to considerable added expense In having to transport all-English flour to ports, and in having to oroct mixing machinery and carry out mixing operations with every consignment of imported flour.   Tho cost of compulsory mixing would bo tantamount to a customs duty on imported flour.(iv) Compulsory admixture  (even if enforceable) would interfere with the trade in recognised special brands of home-milled and imported flour, and is strongly objected to by certain classes of large scale bakers in London, Glasgow and elsewhere on the ground of the difficulties that it would create for thorn in making special types of bread. The requirement is also objected to by millers to Canada and AuDtralia.
ej)The pre&amp;ent proposals avoid all these objections anc in fact,  leave the trade free to manufacture and import the same kinds oi flour as at present 3* Issue of Quota Certificates.For the purposes of the scheme,  it is necessary to Identify home and dominion whoat, and in the nature of the caso this can only be done in documentary form.    The draft Bill provides for the issue by a Wheat Marketing Board (to be set up under the Agricultural Marketing Bill) of quota certificates for homo wheat on its initial sale on behalf of the farmer,  and by the Customs and Excise for dominion wheat and wheat flour on its importation. 4.Use of Quota Certificates.The quota certificates will pass,  either direct or through agents,  to millers and flour Importers, each of whom will be required to produce and surrender to authorised officials certificates in sufficient quantity to discharge his quota obligations.    This does not mean that a particular miller or flour importer necessarily handles the actual wheat specified in the certificates produced by him.    He may purchase quota wheat, retain the quota certificate to meet quota obligations and soli the wheat as &quot;de-certificated&quot; vfheatj    or he may buy quota certificates alone because some other millers, particularly country millers, will undoubtedly buy (for grinding)  certificated wheat in excess of quota requirements and will dispose of excess quota certificates, either direct or through merchants,  to those who require thorn. In all cases, however,  the wheat represented by the quota certificates will have been bought by someone.When certificates change hands without wheat the transaction will be in line with ordinary commercial practice in the commodity markets.    It must bo considered, therefore, as an advantage and not a disadvantage that the certificate system, by admitting of the transfer and sale of documents,

The introduction of a new document, viz.,  the quota certificate,  will not alter the fundamental character of normal market transactions. jPossible &quot;cornering&quot; of wheat or certificates.Under a system requiring physical admixture of the home quota by millers and importers it would bo possible to &quot;corner&quot; home wheat supplies or at any rate to create acute local shortages of home wheat, but under the certificate system, a &quot;corner&quot; In home wheat unaccompanied by certificates would be ineffective and meaningless and local wheat shortages would cease to present a problem.    Any serious attempt to &quot;corner&quot; quota certificates would be rendered practically impossible by:-(I)  the provision limiting the validity of home and dominion quota certificates to a specified period after the date of issue, (ii)  the provision requiring tho wheat Marketing Beard to supply all buyers with home wheat to meet quota requirements and the power of the Minister to vary if sufficient supplies are not available;     (See paragraph 8).(ill) by the further consideration (in the case of the dominion quota)- that the supplies of dominion wheat in the world market will normally be two or three times greater than the quantity required by the United Kingdom millers to satisfy their dominion quota obligation.    (See paragraph 10). * Maximum price for home wheat in the quota scheme.It is proposed that a home quota shall not be brought into operation unless the price of home wheat is less than a prescribed figure  (which has still to be determined) and that the quota should be revoked if the price rises above that figure.    It may be assumed that once a quota i3 in force the Y:heat Marketing Board will sock to stabilise the price of quota wheat at or slightly under the prescribed figure.    On the other hand dominion wheat required for quota purposes should be freely purchaseable at the world price
9 Qlevel, since  (1) dominion wheat exports are far in excess of the quantities that would be required for a dominion quota, even if this were fixed at a high figurej     (2)  in practice the dominion sellers do not as a rule control the destinations of exported wheatj    (3) United Kingdom buyers will be able as at present to buy wheat f.o.b.  dominion ports. 7.  Value of Quo ta Certificate s.It follows from the foregoing paragraph that aviy transfer of home quota certificates without wheat will normally be effected at a price approximating to the difference between the prescribed maximum price for homo wheat and the world price of comparable wheat.Dominion quota certificates will, however, probablypossess no market value although, in certain circumstances,their transfer might be subject to a small accommodation charge.8. &quot;.heat Marketing Board to regulate supplies of home &quot;/heat.Much will depend on the methods of operation of theWheat - ariseting Board, on whom will rest the responsibilityfor so regulating the supply of home wheat that millers and flour importers can purchase sufficient home wheat to meet their quota obligations from time to time.    It is anticipatedthat the powers of the Marketing Board under the agricultural marketing Bill will place all sales of home wheat by producersunder the control of the Board.    Tho Board1s powers wouldenable them to secure tho maintenance of a reserve sufficient-to meet unforeseen demands from millers and flour importersto meet quota requirements.9&apos; Direct consignment from a Dominion not to bo insisted upon for^dominion&quot;quota purposes, as it is for imperial preference . purpose s.The lav/ limits the benefit of preferential duties to goods which are (1) grown or produced in, and (-2) consigned from,  any part of the Empire..    Consequently, Empire goods
tJto qualify for preference must not only be accompanied by evidence of Empire origin but must come to this country from the country of origin on a through Bill of Lading.    If the latter condition were insisted on in the case of dominion wheat for quota purposes, considerable quantities of Canadian wheat which are stored in elevators in the United States and consigned thence to this and other countries would not be eligible for quota certificates on arrival here, and the-supplies of dominion quota wheat would be correspondingly reduced to the detriment of British buyers.    It is proposed therefore, to provide for the issue of quota certificates by the Customs for all imported wheat and wheat flour which the importer declares to be of dominion origin and for which he produces evidence of dominion origin - irrespective of the country from which the goods are consigned.    It will be recognised that this procedure admits of the possibility of non-dominion wheat being substituted for dominion wheat abroad and sent here with documentary evidence of dominion origin which would qualify it for a quota certificate, and the dominions should clearly understand that the procedure -would not be allowed to prejudice the preference position now or in the future.    (it is only necessary to imagine a duty on wheat with a preference to the Dominions to realise the importance of presoriptively limiting the quota procedure to the special case of the quota).dominions to issue satisfactory evidence of origin for all wheat and wheat flour exported oy them to all countries.It is proposed as a condition of a dominion quotathat the Board of Trade shall be satisfied that adequate-arrangements have been made to certify the origin of all their exports,  so that the world supplies of dominion wheat and wheat flour would be available to United Kingdom buyers for quota purposes.6 o
If. Customs procedure in regard to imported, flour.In connection with imports of Dominion flour, the Customs will require the surrender of home wheat quota certificates for an amount corresponding to the quantity-imported, and in connection with imported foreign flour, will require, in addition, the production and surrender of Dominion wheat flour quota certificates for the amount of the Dominion quota.    Flour transhipped and re-exported under   ordinary Customs control will not he subject to quota requirements.The question whether dominion wheat certificates may not be accepted from importers of foreign flour instead of dominion wheat flour certificates needs to be considered in consultation with the trade., Dominion wheat quota to be related to imports of dominion flour. The proposed Bill provides for an increase or reduction of the dominion wheat quota if the imports of dominion wheat flour show a reduction or increase as compared with the average of such imports in a recent period.   By this provision the imports of dominion flour are taken into account in determining the dominion wheat quota.* Procedure by the Minister and the Board of Trade.The Minister and the Board of Trade will be very largely guided by the advice of the proposed Twheat Commissioners who will make recommendations generally on matters relating to the operation of the quotas.    The Minister will be empowered to fix the home quota at a figure sufficient to absorb all home wheat of milling quality.    He may fix the quota from time to tine throughout the season so as it alters, say from month to month to month, to correspond with the normal rate of marketing by producers.    libr example, the quota figure will be higher immediately after harvest than later in the season,
5 ee.The amount of the dominion quota haB still to be determined and will presumably be the subject of negotiations at the Ottawa Conferenoe.As a safeguard for millers and flour importers and in the event of miscalculation the Minister and the Board of Trade may at any time vary the prescribed quotas to correspond with the amount of available supplies. 14. Y/heat Commissioners.In addition to advising the Minister and the Board of Trade on all aspects of quota administration, it is proposed that the &quot;-She at Commissioners in advising the Minister as to the standard of milling quality to be defined for home grown wheat, shall recommend in connection therewith a scale of premiums and dookages for observance by the Wheat Marketing Board and the trade; the object of this is to encourage the production and marketing of the best types and qualities of home grown wheat and to discourage negligent cultivation and preparation for market. IB, Effect, of quota scheme on prices.Since d.ominion wheat will be freely purchasable by millers for quota purposes at world prices, there is no reason to expect that the dominion quota will have any affect,, upon flour and bread prices.The effect of the hone wheat quota on flour and bread prices will depend on the premium commanded by home quota wheat over the world price for comparable wheat.    This depends upon three faotors:-(i)    the maxiuum price prescribed in the Bill, (ii)    the level of world prices, (iii)    the amount of the home quota at any time.It is estimated that an increase of l/** per 400 lbs. in the average cost of wheat in tho millers&apos; grist represents
one tenth, of a -penny on the 4 lb, loaf.    Assuming a premium of 15/- per 400 lbs., and a home quota of 15 per cent., the average increase in the cost of the millers&apos; grist will be 2s,3d., per 480 lbs,, which is equivalent to less than one farthing on the 4 lb, loaf.being used as an excuse for making an unjustifiable increase in flour and bread prices by millers and bakers respectively, it is proposed that some form of control should be exercised and that there should be statutory powers of enforcement&apos; behind a controlling Order.    Certain measures to this effect have been included in the draft -biota Bill, but-these will probably be redundant in the event of a Consumers&apos; Council Bill being passed beforehand.    On the other hand,  if a Consumers&apos; Council Bill is not passed, further provisions similar to those contained in the Bill would have, to be incorporated in the draft Q,quota Bill.at least one third of whioh of which are small country mills probably engaged mostly in grinding 3tock feed.    The staff required to supervise the check on the observance of the quota by millers would not, therefore, be numerous, and it may be possible, by arrangement with the Board of Customs and -Excise, to use the local Customs and ?Jbccice officers for this purpose, Tho Customs Officers already situated at the ports would deal with the Dominion wheat and imported flour as already indicated. It is not, therefore, anticipated that the costs of . adminstratior. would, be large, particularly as it is proposed that the Wheat Marketing Board shall bear suoh share of the expenses of the  lieat Commissioners as the Treasury may approve.16,  Control.of Flour and Bread Prices,In order to prevent the quota provisions fromCost of Administration.There are some 470 Mills In England and Wales,
Northern Ireland.The draft Bill automatically applies to flour importers in the United Kingdom, hut only&apos; to millero in Great Britain.    Tho most convenient method of securing concurrent measures in Northern Ireland as regards Northern Irish Killers is a matter requiring investigation.Ministry of Agrioulture and Fisheries 16th January, 1931.

We agree In principle that Soo-llyh agriculture should have a corresponding advantage to that given to English agriculture by the Wheat Quota Scheme, and that the Secretary of State for Scotland should submit proposals designed to give offe to this principle.Ill-    Announcement of Policy. We are unanimously of the opinion that&quot; it is necessary-1-
that a full agricultural policy    should ho announced forthwith and embodied in a White Paper,IV.      Agricultural Marketing Bill, fle recommend, particularly In view of the strong and united support forthcoming from all sections of Scottish agriculturalists that the Agricultural Marketing Bill should be formally adopted by the Cabinet and introduced in the House of Commons before the end of the present Session so as to be printed and in the hands of Members.
WHEAT QUOTA OOiMJ.TTEE. ITote by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I have grave doubts whether the remedy of the quota system which is proposed to deal with the serious decline in the British cultivation of cereals is likely to be effective having regard to the present and prospective statistical position of world wheat supplies?Before the War, Russia exported 20,000,000 quarters of wheat and Canada about 12 millions.    To-day Canada has four times her pre-war exportable surplus, the Argentine is a bigger factory,  Australia has expanded her area, and Russia is, after many struggles, now definitely in the export market this harvest and likely rapidly to increase.    How far therefore a quota system to maintain British production is likely to be effective is extremely problematical.    If, however,  the Cabinet decide, after consideration of  the political effect of the adoption of the quota, that there is no alternative proposal available, then in my view the quota scheme should be freed from the objections which will he raised^ to its being based on the marketing of certificates, etc.  and should he of a character which would not pre-iudice the consideration and adoption of a wider scheme of Import Boards at a later date.      The composition and functions of the Board now proposed would require the most oaraful consideration, but its powers should be sufficient to give real control of the marketing of the British crop and to prevent its operations from maintaining inefficient production.    The position of Northern Ireland would also have to be made very clear before the scheme
is adopted and prevented from rendering the scheme nugatory.(Sgdu)    juvenile. AIiEXAiTDiiR.louse of Commons ,25th July, 1930.
