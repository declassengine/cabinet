THIRD    REPORT.In pursuance of the Cabinet request at their meeting on the 4th March last (Cabinet 16 (51) Conclusion 7), we have again conferred with the Deputation from the Joint Disarmament Committeej and have undertaken that that Committee should be furnished with a written explanation of our reasons for being unable to recoiumend the acceptance of the suggestion that a necessitous areas grant should be given to those areas specially-distressed in consequence of the Governments disarmament policy.At the meeting in question It was suggested that our reply should contain a summary of the particular measures which have been taken by the Government in relief of unemployment. We agree   with this suggestion, and have accordingly incorporated such a summary in the revised draft of tho letter which is to be sent to the Joint Disarmament Committee,  a copy of which is annexed hereto (See Appendix).We recommend the Cabinet : -To approve the despatch by the Chairman of the Committee to the Joint Disarmament Committee    of the TradesUnion Council, of a letter in the form of the draft set out in theiAppendix to this Report.Signed on behalf of the Committee.T.

op ,hi hi j:A P P E N D I X. LEAPT LETTER TO ME.  HARRIES.(Revised after tlie discussion  .t the Meeting between the Cabinet Committee and the Deputation from the Joint Disarmament Committee on 17th March;, 1931).Dear Mr. Harries,You will remember that at the meeting on March 17th. between the Deputation of the Joint Disarmament Committee and the Cabinet Committee on the Economic Consequences of Disarmament the question of grants for areas specially-distressed in consequence of Disarmament policy, which had been discussed at the previous meeting on the 20th November last5 was again examined.      On this occasion the President of the Board of Trade and I indicated our views with regard to this proposal, and promised that the conclusions reached by the Government regarding the matter should be communicated to you in writing with as little delay as possible..In effect the proposal is that a necessitous areas grant should he given to a number of selected areas in aid of the extra expenditure incurred by the authorities for those areas in tho relief of tho distress caused by the displacement of workpeople as a result of Disarmament policy.As was pointed out at the meetings referred to above, this question is one which specially concerns the Minister of Healthy the Minister of Labour, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and those Ministers have given it their most careful and sympathetic consideration.Apart altogether from the question of principles the views unanimously expressed ^oy tho three Ministers in question make it clear that the administrative difficulties
of giving effect to the proposal are of so serious a character that its successful operation must be regarded as highly problematical if not impossible.Even if it could be established that additional grants in aid of local government were necessary it would be impossible to discriminate between areas in the way suggested, and to give grants to districts affected by Disarmament policy and to withhold them from other districts possibly more heavily burdened? which could claim that their difficulties were to some extent attributable to the policy of the Government in matters such as industrial reorganisations      It should also be observed that even the authorities which regard themselves as.necessitous5 realise that to-day their claim for special assistance is weaker than it has been in the past. Apart from the very substantial benefit which the more heavily burdened areas have received under the financial provisions of the Local Government Act ? considerable relief of local burdens has been given by the Unemployment Insurance Act of last Session, and by the largely increased grants for Unemployment works,V7h.ile I and the other members of the Cabinet Committee fully appreciate the value of your proposals    we   feel compelled to agree with the considered opinion of the Ministers of Health and Labour that the Secretary of State for Scotland, that its benefits could not be confined to areas distressed in consequence of disarmament policy5 andv/e   much regret that    we   have not found it possible to recommend the Cabinet to adopt the suggestion.
As explained at tlie meeting on March 17th, \?e are convinced that unemployment,  due to whatever causa, must he dealt with on uniform lines throughout the country, and that a policy hasea on discrimination in favour of unemployment duo to some particular cause or causes, is hound to fail. In this connection attention must he drawn to the measures which have &quot;been taken in the last two years to deal with the problem as a whole, as a result of which, notwithstanding the severity of the trade depression, the well-being of the population has been maintained in a degree which compares&apos; favourably with the experience of any previous depression.These measures include the- approval of unenrploymait relief schemes involving an aggregate expenditure of about  150 millions, which Will provide employment, much of it in &quot;che heavy industries,  to the extent of more than 600,000 man years.      This is a programme which compares favourably with that which the Government of any other country has been able to frame to mitigate the unemployment resulting from the world depression of trade.The Government have adopted various measures designed to foster and extend the export trade, in particular I would refer to the continuance of the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme to the 31st March,  1935, and to the increasing extent to which recourse lias been had to the facilities afforded since,the present scheme began in 1926.    In this connection I may mention that since 1st October, 1929,  the total value of exports to Russia in connection with which the Export Credits Department has given guarantees may be as much as *06-g-millions.      Practically the whole of this amount represents business which in all probability would not otherwise have been done.
hi \J iThe Government have also given special help in certain exceptional cases; for example,  the &quot;building of the new Cuuard liner has been rendered possible by the Government&apos;s action in facilitating the insurance arrangements.Steps have been talc en to improve the technical equipment, and to increase the efficiency of British business organisation, and to put British industry in a stronger position for competing in world markets.     Examples of these activities are to be found in the steps which have been&apos; taken to reorganise the coal,  the iron and steel, and the cotton industries.      Moreover, as was recently announced in the House of Commons, the Government have decided in connection with the efforts that are being made in certain areas to attract new industrial development,  to undertalee industrial surveys in South Wales, Lancashire,  the north-Bast Coast of England,  and the South-West Coast of Scotland.Mention must also he made of the relief provided by the   Unemployment Insurance scheme, which the Government have modified so as to improve the  scale of benefit in certain cases, and the conditions for the payment of benefit.      These changes have entailed a sensible relief to the expenditure of local authorities^ particularly in the depressed areas.We are aware cf  your difficulties, arid youranxiety to help in the present chaotic world condition,anu we regret that we have found o\xrselves unable torecommend your suggestions to the Cabinet.      You on yourpart will also realise we are sure,  the difficulties wehave to face.      We shall always be ready to consider any proposals ;..&quot;ou may wish to suggest from time to time.I am,  etc.,Harries, Esq.
