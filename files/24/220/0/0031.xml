u I,:^rg nnotlMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government.SECRET^ Copy No.       ^&apos;0.P.8l(3l).CABINET. State of Trade* Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The reports for February indicate a continuance of acute depression in most important industries.     There was a further increase in unemployment which, though small, is disappointing in view of the substantial improvement in employment which is normal for this time of year.     There has, however, been some recovery in wholesale prices, notably of wool and cotton, and this, coupled with other hopeful developments such as the India and Disarmament Settlements abroad, and the resumption of work in Lancashire, appears to have led to a somewhat more confident feeling for the future in industry generally.     In particular the position in the textile industries,  especially woollens and hosiery, shows distinct improvement, though this has not yet resulted in a recovery of export trade,  and the returns for the departmental and co-operative stores continue to show good results.     On the other hand, the position in the heavy industries remains very serious and no improvement in the outlook is reported.Comparing February this year with February,  1930, exports of merchandise (by value) decreased by 38 per cent, (and imports by 28 per cent.), and though February is a short month and it must be remembered that in the same period prices have fallen substantially, the actual figures,  32,000,000 exports and  6,000,000 re-exports, are deplorably low.The general unemployment percentage was 21.7 on February 23rd last as compared with 21.5 on January 26th last and with 12.9 on February 24th last year.     The estimated number of
9 0 ilinsured persons in employment fell fron 9,250,300 on January 26th to 9,227,900 on February 23rd, while the increase in the numbers registered as wholly unemployed was only 10,000 and the numbers temporarily stopped remained stationary.Railway traffic receipts for February again showed a heavy decline (11.16 per cent,) compared with the same month of last year:    for general merchandise the decline was 15^f per cent., and for coal and coke 9 per cent.      The shipping freight index for February was 32.6 (1913      100), which is five points less than that for January and 1.6 more than a year ago.There &quot;as a further increase in unemployment in the coal industry and the outlook generally showed no iarprovement. exports of coal in February were greater than in January (when shipments were much affected by the South &apos;7ales stoppage), hut one million tons less than in February,  1930, and competition from Westphalia and Poland continues to be very keen.     Complaints were made by the representatives of the Co-operative Society, and others, of difficulties encountered owing to the operation of the quota schemes,   and there was a feeling that greater elasticity in the working out of the schemes might perhaps be introduced.In the iron and steel industry there has heen a small decrease in unemployment, hut the percentage of unemployment in the main sections on February 23rd was 44.2 per cent, compared with 22.7 per cent. a.year ago.      The average daily output of pig iron was 4.6 per cent, higher last month than in January, but stocks remain heavy and competition is very keen, with the result that furnaces in this country are standing idle there were only 81 In blast at the end of February - while the rolling mills use imported material.     The steel ingot output last month was only 60 per cent, of the output in February, 1930,  the tonnage remaining on the order hooves is still
declining and the difficulties in the export trade continue. It was pointed out that there is likely to he competition in iron and steel from Russia in the future:    in November last Russia produced more pig iron and steel than we did,  and the Five Years Plan contemplates a production more than double the normal output in this country.There was a further decline in employment in the engineer-ing and motor vehicle industries.      There has been a continuous decrease in the demand for motor cars since 1929 which has so far been maintained this year and the number of vehicles newly registered in January showed a decrease of 5.8 per cent, compared with January,  1930.On the other hand,   some good orders have been obtained for iron and steel and engineering products,  including substantial quantities of  rails,  wagons and steel sleepers for the Indian, argentine and South African Railways, and an important contract for the electrification of the Hungarian stretch of the Budapest-Vienna main line at a cost of some  1,750,000.      Orders for excavators amounting to  110,000 have been obtained from Russia,  and these,  it is stated, might have been larger if it had been possible to give longer credit.In connection with the proposals of the Engineering and Allied Employers Federation for dealing with the present economic  situation, a Committee-has been set up consisting of 15 representatives of the Federation and 15 representatives of the 47 Trade Unions concerned,  which is to go thoroughly into the whole subject.Employment in the shipbuilding industry again declined. New orders are practically non-existent and it is reported that only 6 berths are now occupied in the whole of the Tyne and Wear areas.      This,  of course,  is extremely serious for the Plate mills.      There seems, moreover, to be no prospect of
3 n qany improvement in the near future oince the shipping position remains as serious as ever.      There has probably been some slight reduction in laid-up tonnage as a result of&quot; ships going out to the Argentine in ballast to carry wheat, tut the general position remains unchanged.     The deadlock over Russian chartering for timber,  referred to in last month&apos;s report, continues, but it is understood that some foreign ships are accepting the Russian terms,      Russian chartering for grain has practically ceased.      She is, however,  sending some sugar to India while still importing (refined) sugar from Great Britain.The non-ferrous metals are still very heavily over-stocked and there appears to be no sign of a general revival of demand.     The tin restriction scheme came into force on the 1st of this month and covers some 92 per cento of the total world production.As stated above, the reports from the textile industries are somewhat more hopeful this month.      The price of raw cotton has at last begun to show a rising tendency and there is greater activity in the industry generally than for some time past.    The improvement is especially marked in the weaving mills since the stoppage, and is no doubt partly due to the accumulation of orders.      It is too early yet for the agreement in India to have had any substantial effect in Lancashire and opinions differ as to the extent to which the boycott still continues, but there is undoubtedly a better feeling and more enquiries are coming in from India.There has been a remarkable recovery in wool prices since the latter half&quot; of January which it is thought is,  this tine, not merely temporary.      Prices in London last week were 15 per cent,  to 20 per cent, more than on February 6th,   and the demand for wool in ail the primary markets has been very Keen.     The improvement in machinery activity is reported to be in excess of the usual seasonal expansion at this period.
9 p ^U &apos;ii JIn the hosiers&apos;- trade the woollen section is benefiting from the rise in the price of wool and is placing a large number of orders for yarn.     Complaints continue to he -made, however, of the large and increasing imports of goods from abroad at very low prices and the export trade is still declining.As regards other industries,  the report from the chemical industry indicates that there has been no change in the position since last month.      Owing partly, no doubt,  to weather conditions, the seasonal revival in the boot and shoe industry has not yet been felt and works arc running considerably below capacity.      Reports from the rubber industry are not quite so good as usual:    the falling demand for motor cars is having its effect on the demand (both home and export)  for motor tyres,  and in other sections of the industry there are complaints that foreign manufacturers are unloading their surplus stocks at dumping prices.The price of imported wheat rose during February, but the position of the exporting countries (especially Canada and the United States of America) which are trying to keep up prices is becoming increasingly difficult.      The United States Farm Board have announced that they will cease to support the market after May;    meanwhile, they want to dispose of 36 million bushels of wheat which is, however, two or three years old. Russia, as indicated above, would not appear to be shipping wheat so actively, but is still offering freely at low prices, Further large supplies are coming from Australia and the Argentine.The representative of the Co-operative Wholesale stated that the Manager of their tea gardens in India has been four or five months in Russia teaching tea planting there.
No general change in the low level of prices of foodstuffs is reported, hut there have heen some increases, via.P  in butter and potatoes.     As already stated, sales in the Departmental and Co-operative stores continue to show good results.     For the months August,  1930,  to January, 1931, sales in.Departmental stores in Great Britain as a whole were only down in value by 2.9 per cent, comparod with the same period in 1929 in spite of the fall in prices,  and in the South of England they were actually up 2 per cent.     Owing to the great success of the half-yearly sales, the returns for January this year actually show an increase of .3 per cent,  in value as compared with last year, whereas the United States and Germany show decreases of 7 per cent, and 9,7 per cent., respectively.The money rate has fallen slightly to 2% per cent.,  and has had to be supported by the Bank of England owing to the low discount rates in New York (l-g- per cent.) and Paris (l11/!6 Per cento).      These lead to foreign buying of bills in London and are reflected in the weakness of the foreign exchanges (the franc depreciated to over 124 for the first time since April, 1930).     There is a rather more confident feeling in the money market in spite of the imminence of the Budget, but recently published estimates of the country&apos;s invisible earnings for 1930 show that the depression has seriously curtailed our ability to lend abroad and new capital issues for trade purposes for the month of February amounted to less than  6;000,000 compared with  30,000,000 in February, 1928.Very little change is reported in the situation in Australia, but the rise in the price of wool, if maintained, will be of great assistance.      The proposal of the Premiersr Conference to raise a loan of  6,000,000 to pay an export bounty of 6d. a bushel on the 1930/31 wheat crop and to provide
loans to State Governments to assist necessitous wheat growers has been abandoned, but the Commonwealth Government propose to finance the same scheme by creating fiduciary currency.There are signs of improvement and general settling down in all the South American countries.     The exchange position is Tsetter in the argentine and optimism as to the future prevails there for the moment;    much is expected by British interests from the Buenos Ayres Exhibition.     Coffee remains the acute problem in Brazil, the average price per bag having fallen from  5 in 1929 to  2.16s. last year.      The Federal Government propose to purchase large quantities of the stocks at a fixed price of 20/- per bag, and additional planting is being taxed with a view to restricting any further increase of production.Board of Trade.31st March,  1931.

MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL OH THURSDAY,   12th MARCH,   1951.MR. ROWLAND:    I handed in my Report&apos; yesterday, and am pleased to draw attention to one or two features which, in small measure, may Justify a slight revival of the general confidence which has been shown in recent weeks.The Report draws attention to the fact that the steel output was considerably higher in January as compared with December,  and although the figure of production was slightly leas the number of furnaces in operation increased in the month by seven from 76 to 83j which seems to assure an increase of output in February.    Again, foreign tre.de returns, allowing for holidays and weather conditions, were not altogether unfavourable compared with the preceding months.    Imports of iron and steel and   machinery were less than in December, and the exports of these products were only very slightly below the totals for that month.    The value per ton of machinery imported declined, while the export value per ton showed a satisfactory increase.    Even the unemployment percentages in respect of our basic industries did not advance quite so much as might have been expected;    in fact the index in respect of the iron and steel industry fell from 49^ to 44*2$ , and unemployment in coal mining also decreased, if only very slightly.While not attaching undue importance to these improve-raents, they are sufficiently noteworthy to give us some hope that we are pretty nearly touching bottom.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL;    The principal commodity for the rubber industry of course is tyres, and there a large part of the business depends upon the motor car demand.    That is for the equipment of new cars.      Unfortunately, this year the demand for motor cars is appreciably smaller than it was last year, and that in turn was lower than it was in 1929.    The replacement business is fairly steady, but the adverse weather conditions of the last few weeks have affected the volume of motoring.    The export trade is depressed owing to world conditions, and the competition Is Intensely keen, particularly from America.    The motor cycle and cycle tyre demand is a little below last year, particularly in the export market.Sports goods have been affected by the weather, particularly at the week-ends, which have been uniformly bad for the last month or two.Footwear I reported fully upon last time,  and the competition which has been experienced from one or two markets, particularly Japan and Belgium.    There is one chain store organisation in this country which has placed an order, we understand,  in Belgium for 1 million pairs of sport shoes, which are retailed at 1/- a pair, which is less than the labour and material for a similar shoe in this country, manufacturer^ cost.    Industrial boots suffer with the general depression.    Thread is partly the subject of fashion, and a change in fashion is causing a reduced demand for thread.*-See page 3*4.
In Mechanical rubber we are dependent entirely on the state of general industry, and until there is a revival in general industry we shall not get much improvement,A good step forward has been taken in the belting section. We have now a standard specification approved by the British Engineering Standards Association which should go a long way towards establishing a definite standard for rubber belting and give confidence to people who have hitherto been rather reluctant to order that class of product.Generally speaking, the Report is quite a depressing one this time .MR. HILTON:   February was a month, of small fluctuations in the numbers of unemployed.   There was a slight rise in the first week, then a fall in the next two weeks, and then a rise in the last week of the month.    That left a net increase of just over 10,000 during the month.   As compared with past experiences, that increase during the month was not so great as it was during the month of February last year, and yet there was, as I say, a slight increase during the month, which is not what we have been accustomed to expect from the experience of a number of past years.     February, taking the general run of the years, shows a substantial improvement in employment.   This last February, one might almost say, it has remained steady, but with a slight tendency upward.This 10,000 increase occurred mainly in the number of wholly unemployed.    The numbers temporarily stopped remained almost stationary.   The 10,000 increase was distributed not quite evenly over the country.    The London and South Eastern, and South Western, Divisions showed a slight fall in unemployment so did the North Eastern and North Western;    the Midlands, Scotland and Wales throughout increased.   Wales was the only part of the Kingdom where the unemployment increased steadily through the month.Considering   the results by industries unemployment increased, during the month in coal mining, engineering, motor vehicle manufacturing, shipbuilding and ship-repairing, and in the distributive trades.    On the other hand, there was a slight improvement in iron and steel, and a distinct decrease in the numbers unemployed in the cotton and wool industries, and in the building trade.Turning to the total number of insured persons estimated to be at work, that is in employment, at 21st February, that figure is provisionally estimated at about 96,000 more than the month previously, that is 36th January.   At that time, however, the figures were affected by the cotton dispute.    At 21st February the numbers in employment were about 791,000 less than the year previously at 2ith February,1930.MR. LINDSAY:    It ia rather too early yet to say what the precise effect of the Irwin-Gandhi Agreement has had on business conditions in India, but it certainly seems to have had a favourable result so far.    One of the evidences is the liquidation, to a certain extent, of cotton piece goods.
On the other hand although the spurt in enquiries for Manchester cotton goods from India was very marked, I think I am correct in saying that the actual business resulting has not been very great so far.    At the same time, however, the general atmosphere is certainly very much better.    As I say, however, that is too recent history for me to be able to quote definite results.On prices, I think there is some Indication that, as far as Indian staple commodities, in this market are concerned, we are beginning to see a turn towards the better.    I have a statement he re &quot;&quot;&quot;which I shall put in, comparing the highest and lowest prices of rice,  jute, castor seed, linseed,  ground nuts, copra, tea and cotton, in January, again in February, and again at the beginning of Maroh and on the 10th of March, and those show in most oases a recovery over the lowest level of previous months. On the imports side, our latest figures are for April-December 1930, and, compared with the same months&quot;of 1929, they show a distinct falling off&apos; on both sides of the account imports and exports.I gave last month an account of that falling off in percentage of values, showing that about 18$ of the reduction is due to the fall in prices.    At the same time, that does not conceal the fact that there has been a falling off in quantities too.    On an examination of the general run of trade, I should say that in quantities our trade has fallen off by about 20fo in staple lines.      Piece goods show the worst returns.   The import of cotton piece goods into India during the seven months April - December 1930 Is almost exactly half the imports during the corresponding period of 1929.    It is said that the Indian mills are taking full advantage of this to cover as much of the ground as possible. The actual figures show that the Indian mills are producing almost exactly the same quantities this year that they were last year; or in other words while the imports have fallen off the Indian manufacture has remained stationary.    That means an increased consumption of Indian piece goods in India because our exports of Indian goods have also fallen off.Mr. EARLOV::      In connection with the comparative output of the Indian mills this year with last year,  that is to say December of last year and the previous twelve months, December,  is not the output being equal accounted for by the fact that in the previous year a great number of the Bombay mills were idle, while the mills now are not producing to full capacity,  so that we should see a considerably increased out-turn from the Indian&apos;mills from last December onwards to what it was twelve months previously?MR. LI1TDSAY:    Yes, I should think that is probably correct, but the figures I am quoting are the figures for April - December 1930 as compared with April - December 1929. As you say,  1920 was a year when the Bombay mills were certainly not working full time, and therefore it does follow that if all goes well 1931 will probably see a considerable advance in local production.Soo page 32.
9 e&apos; i- . ^ &apos;4 wMR. CAIRNS:    Has that observation any reference to the  jute mills, because the explanation in the case of the jute mills is that the production from this time onwards will be a great deal less?   As you know the Jute Mills Association has reached a settlement of the question of reduced production, and it is expected that from this time onwards, at least until the end of the year, the production will be about 503 less than it was  last year, but your observation does not refer to that,  it is the cotton mills?MR. LINDSAY:      Cotton mills only, yes.SIR ERNEST GLOVER:    I am sorry to say that there is no improvement to report in the shipping trade - in fact, the index number for February is 5 points down, at 82,  compared with 100 in 1913*    The costs of running are only very slightly down.The position with regard to coal exports continues very unsatisfactory, small business doing at very low rates.    It is rather interesting to note that, according to statistics,  the January export of coal from this country was just over 3-5- millior. tons against 5J- million tons in January of the previous year.    I have not the February figures.With regard to general cargo., the scarcity of cargo offering continues.    With regard to the Argentine, there was a little spurt    a little while ago in anticipation of the Exhibition there, but that spurt seems to have worked off.    The removal of the boycott in India leads to hope of something better coming; but it has not materialised yet.    So far as Australia is concerned, the difficulties continue there owing to the high tariff,  and the exchange position.With regard to grain business generally, the export fro&quot; Russia during the last few weeks, at least the chartering from Russia, has practically stepped.    The Argentine has been doing a big business at low rates.    Small business was done from Canada and America, principally to the Mediterranean,, for wheat, but that has rather slowed down again, and practically the only business from America at the present time is sugar from Cuba and San Domingo.India has been doing a little more business both from Sombay and from the Calcutta side,  and a certain amount of rice business from Burma.    The tonnage has become available there for employment owing to sugar cargoes from South Russia to India; and a certain amount of wheat from Australia to India. Otherwise there is very little change there.So far as Russia is concerned, the deadlock with regard to the timber chartering continues.    The Russians are announcing from time to time that they have succeeded in getting one or two steamers; which are usual 3. y - I think always - foreign and so far British owners are not willing, to concede the Russian terms which, as I mentioned a month ago, are unusual and unreasonable.Shipbuilding has nothing better to report.    There are no orders placed for ordinary overseas steamers, there are only two or three orde&quot;rs for small specialities like cross-Channel passenger steamers, and a Belgian training ship.    The tonnage
under construction on 51st December was 900,000 against ill- million tons the year before.    The tonnage launched in December was just under 300,000 tons as against 473,000 and the tonnage commenced in December was 133,000 tons against 500,000, which shows how shipbuilding has been slowed down.With regard to 1aid-up tonnage, there is very little alteration in the amount.    There may be some reduction because some of the more modern large steamers which were laid up have been sent out in ballast to the Argentine at figures which,j I presume, show less loss than lying up.    That Is the extent of It,    The bulk of laid-up tonnage remains undisturbed.I will put in my usual statement/&quot;&quot;&apos;IMR. GILLETT:    I understand that the coal exports for February were 3,532,000 tons against 3,271,000 for JanuarySIR ERNEST GLOVER:    It should be somewhere near 5 million to be anything like rignt.MR. CHADWICK:    I do not know that I have anything different to report from what Was reported on the last occasion.    The industry continues in a depressed state, and very little change has taken place.    There are approximately 20^ less men employed in this industry than this time last year.;Both sides of the industry. both the emplojrera&apos; and the employees&apos;  sides, have expressed themselves recently on the need for something being done relative to seeking to bring back something like a stable position in this particular industry.    I cannot say definitely what they think is required to stabilise the industry, but they have decided upon an investigation between themselves into all matters affecting the industry.    That investigation will start within a fortnight. As to what the result of it will be, of course one cannot prophesy at this stage.    We can only hope that it will prove to be of benefit to the industry in general.MR. GILLETT:    Who Is going to carry out the investige.tion -a small Committee?MR. CHADWICE:    A small Committee fifteen from each sideiMR, GILLETT5    Representing employers and the Trade Unions, do you mean?MR. CHADV7ICK:    Yes.MR. GILLETT:    Have they been appointed?MR. CHADWICK:    The representatives from the Trade Unions side have been appointed.    The representatives from the employers&apos; side were being considered yesterday afternoon. I cannot say at this stage what the appointments from that side will be.See page 22.t The Committee is to consider the proposals of the Engineering and Allied Employers Federation for dealing with the present oconomio situation and will consist of 15 representatives of tho Federation and 15 representatives of tho 47 Trado Uniono concerned.
9 &apos;6 QO 4. C5ME. GILLETT:    Will the Chairman be connected with the trade,  or an outsider?MR. CHADWICK:    It Is simply an internal matter between those inside the Industry.    No outside people are admitted to the investigation at this stage.    Tbe findings of the Committee will be reported to the constituent, bodies of both sides.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE:    I will put in the usual statement for the January trade which,  as anticipated in my report to the Council last month, shows very well&quot;&quot;.    In spite of the fall in the cost of living Index figure of 7.3$ sales in money value were actually up as compared with the corresponding month of 1930 by .3$.    These results are based on returns from 136 departmental stores, and when it is observed that the money value of stocks at cost at the end of January were down by 9.6$ the figures on the face of them show very well.    The results were almost wholly due to the exceptional success enjoyed by the half-yearly sales In January, and I think it would be a mistake to assume that they represent the beginnings of a revival in trade, as the circumstances were certainly abnormal.    On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that for the second half of the Financial Year, namely, from August 1930 to January 1931, the report shows that sales were down by no more than 2.9$ for Great Britain as a whole,  while in the South of England, excluding London,  sales actually increased over that period by just under 2$.    In view of the substantial fall which took place in prices during that period, combined with the reduced purchasing power of the public, and the tendency previously referred to of purchasing goods of lower quality, these results must, I think, be regarded as satisfactory under the circumstances.It may interest the Committee to have the corresponding figures for the United States and Germany.    According to the Federal Reserve Board, sales in the departmental stores fell during January by 7$, and In Germany, according t&apos;o the Institute of Tradem sales were down by 9.7$.-    the results in Great Britain showing an increase on the month of .5$. therefore continue to be much more favourable than in the other two countries named.The results for February trade are not yet available, but the preliminary report suggests that a falling off of at least 5$ may be expected.    After the spurt which took place in January, trade in February, which is alwajrs one of the quiet months of the year, has been very disappointing, and it is quite certain that the final report will not make such a good showing as for last month.I would like to take this opportunity of Informing the Council that next month the basis of the retail trade report will be very much enlarged, as it will be based on returns furnished not only by the departmental stores but also from 200 Co-operative Societies:      multiple branch organisations in several lines of trade:    and chain stores: which together control between 5,000 and 3,000 branches throughout the country.    The report should,  therefore, give a much more representative picture of retail trade as a whole than the reports I have been able to provide previously.wThese figures are reproduced in the Board of Trade Journal for February 26th, page 263-4.
MR. BOSTOCK;    There has been an absence of the usual seasonal improvement that we expect at this time of the year.   Buyers generally are withholding from committing themselves, and apart from one or two people who are working under what is generally regarded in the trade as unfair conditions, there is a state of extreme slackness prevailing. There is also some anxiety in regard to the labour position. The negotiations for the renewal of the national Conference Agreement have come to a deadlock.   The Federation have given six months notice to terminate the Agreement.    The Unions are having a Delegate Conference Meeting at Leicester today.   I hope we Bhall ultimately get through some sort of settlement, but at present there is a very marked difference of opinion between the two sides.   The employers hold that there ought to be some reduction in the cost of production, but the Unions at present are unwilling to admit that any case is made out for any reductions, and are therefore resisting them in toto.MR. WALKER:   With regard to hosiery, the report is rather curious.   Some centres report quite as pessimistically as they have been doing recently.    On the other hand in Nottingham there is certainly a more optimistic tone, and I think with regard to Leicester the very definite improvement with regard to wool prices will have a very beneficial effect. From a talk I had with one or two manufacturers yesterday, there seemed to be a more optimistic tone in the expectation that orders will now be placed.At the same time, I would just like again to refer - I have referred to them very often - to the very large increases that have taken place, especially last year, in imports of goods from abroad.   They are really rather striking.   The figures last year showed, in hose alone, an increase of one million dozen pairs.   We are now importing nearly Si-million dozen pairs of stockings and hose.    With regard to underwear, there is an increase of 373,000 dozen pairs, and in fancy hosiery there is an increase of 321,000 dozen pairs. All these big increases of course manifestly have their repercussion on the home trade, and last year was undoubtedly a very bad year for hosiery manufacturers generally.At the same time, it is rather interesting to report that the one section that is making headway all the time is silk hose.    The imports for quite a number of years now have been steadily showing a decline.    In 1029 it was 173,000 dozen,  and last year 139,000, showing quite a definite decrease.    That seems to be going on all the time. That is the really one bright spot in the hosiery industry. Silk hose undoubtedly is busy and has been busy all the time. I am speaking of silk purely.   Artificial silk, on the other hand, shows a very big inorease.MR. GILLL&apos;TT:    Where are these stockings coming from? Are they coming from any special country?MR. WALKER:    These imports are coming from several countries - Germany, especially, Czechoslovakia, Japan.MR. GILLETT:    They are distinctly cheaper?MR. WALKER:    It is purely on price.   Just to show the prices - Sir George Beharrell gave one instance - speaking
9 9 f&amp;oto a hosiery manufacturer yesterday, he told me that the price of a cheap jumper from Japan coming into this country was 7/9d a dozen - that is 7fd, a garment.    He had the price of the labour worked out, and the labour in this country would come to 7 id. - practically the same result as Sir George Beharrell gave.MR. CAIRNS;    It would be interesting to kno-&apos; the experience of the trade in the matter of exports.    Mr. Walker has told us that the imports have gone up.    What about the exports?    Have they gone up or down?MR. WALKER:    Our export trade is undoubtedly   bad,    I have not the exact figures before me, but the export generally has been bad,, with the exception of silk hose,-  and I think I am right in saying that they have increased.   Unfortunately, I have not the figures here/&quot;MR. VARLEYl    Has Mr. Walker any definite knowledge with regard to tne placing of orders for hosiery yarn?MR. WALKER:    It is a little early to say, but undoubtedly there has been during the last few days a tremendous placing of orders in hosiery woollen yarns by the manufacturers.MR. BARLOW:    The volume  of trade in cotton goods continues to be very unsatisfactory, and during the latter part of last year, according to statistics, Japanese exports exceeded those of Great Britain in piece goods which may be said to be another landmark in the melancholy post-war experience of the industry.    There has been a considerable rise in the prices of raw cotton since the beginning of the year, but it is too early to say whether this is due to *bear* covering or whether there has been a definite increase of buying on the part of consumers.    If there has not, a recession in the price of raw cotton is to be expected.    At the same time a rather better tone does exist.    The recent lockout which arose as the result of the 8 loom controversy was terminated abruptly by the employers after three weeks stoppage.The recent Cotton Exhibition which was held at the White City may be said to have been more successful than was anticipated, by many people, and those firms who trade in fancy dress goods were agreeably surprised by the orders they obtained.    The experience gained by this exhibition will be of great value in regard to future exhibitions of the same kind should it be decided that they should be undertaken.MR- GREY:    I think Mr. Barlow has fairly well summarised the situation;    I agree with him that there is a better tone in the market generally now than there has been for some considerable time.    The latest reports that we have in the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association as to the number of looms working show an improving tendency.and a-&quot;Exports of hosiery during 1930 were uniformly below those for 1929., silk stockings and hose not excepted.    In January and February 1931 exports v?ere  525,220 compared with  916,735 an the same months of 1930.
slightly higher percentage than what have been working since the termination of the lockout or for some considerable time prior to the lockout.   The cotton trade has undoubtedly gone through the worst year last year that it has ever experienced, and we are still in the throes of that condition although I believe there is just for the time being a better feeling and a little more optimistic outlook.as regards the effects of the Irwin-Gandhi Conversations and the agreements come to I agree with Mr. Lindsay that it is too early for them to have reflected much improvement in Lancashire and in our relations with India, but so far as one can gather, and. I only had confirmation       that this morning from a friend who deals direct with. India, a manufacturer who had a telegraphic reply yesterday - there is no movement of goods into consumption in Calcutta, the boycott and picketing were just as intense as ever, and the  same condition applies to Bombay where there was an effort this week to open up one of the largest bazaars, but it has had to be closed down again for a week.We are now on our fourth week since the termination of the lockout and trie re has not been a tremendous increase in trade, but I think some improvement.    Of course part of that may be attributable  to the fact that business was held up during the dispute.    I do not think there has been a great deal of new trade with India done, I think it is more speculative enquiry on the part of merchants who buy lines that run regularly in quantities with the idea that the market will soon be available, but I do not think there has been much business done in those lines beyond enquiry as to price and delivery and to see if it is possible to fix up orders.    I cannot speak much for spinning,, I am not a spinner, I am a manufacturer, but I think spinning conditions continue to be rather bad, but there have been more yarns moving during the last few weeks than for a considerable period of time.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG:   (Australia):    I put in the usual telegram summarising the position In Australia       There is nothing of very special note to draw attention to except possibly that the improving prices in wool are of course of great Importance to Australia,  and should that continue it will improve the export position in that country and it is hoped will re-establish the economic position a little, otherwise there is not very rnu.cn variation out there as regards the political and economic position.MR. LENNOX LEE:    I have nothing to add to what has been said on the cotton question and I hand in my report on the condition of trade mr. VERhUN:    Mr. Charir-jan, I will put in a report-,-.   The complete trade figures for the whole of the calendar year 1950, nearly all show very much the same tendency, which is a large decrease in the value of exports taking the year as a whole. The decrease in Kenya and &quot;Uganda was  1 million, Nigeria  2 million. Tanganyika nearly  1 million, the Gold Coast  600,000 and so on,-j^See page 47. -st-ic-See page 31.  .      fSee page 40.
-while in the case of Ceylon there is an actual decrease in value of exports of no less than  71 millions.   That decrease is almost exactly reflected in the figures of imports in the case of Ceylon and in most cases there is a slight lag and reduction in Imports a little later.    X have given these figures in values and it does not indicate so large a reduction in quantities exported hut it does indioate that reduction in the buying capacity of the population and probably in the market for g ods in those places.I will put in statistics with regard to rubber from Malaya,* which show that comparing 1930 with 1929 there was a reduction in the gross exports of about 30,000 tons, and that is almost exactly reflected in the reduction in the foreign imports from feialaya, that is, the reduction was almost entirely in production of rubber made elsewhere and exported.   On the other hand the latest figures we have for the month of January show a reduction of 10,000 tons, but the month of January 1930 was rather inflated by the fact that it was one of the first months after the cessation of restriction.The principal occurrence of importance with regard to the Colonies has been the introduction of the tin restriction scheme wnich came into force on the 1st of this :.ionth.   The British j-errltories concerned in that are kalaya and Nigeria and in both cases the Government have come into the International Scheme with the full   concurrence, in fact at the instance of the milling interests concerned.    The general effect of the scheme is that the proportion of export from various tin producing countries in 1929 is taken as the standard, the percentage of ualaya and the percentage of Nigeria in 1929 are fixed.    Then a total figure is fixed for the production in 1931 which is subject to reconsideration after six months.    The actual world production in 1929 was 186,000 tons.    The figure which has been at present taken for 1931 is 145,000 tons, so that the intention is to reduce production below the standard y^-ar 1929 by 40,000 tons which represents something like 22.c   The object of course is to deal with the precipitous fall In value.    The average value of tin in 1926 was  291, in 1927 it was  298.    a few weeks ago the value wag  105.    I am told that it is now slightly over  122, the increase being the result of the publication of the restriction scheme.    One element in the situation is that there are two appreciable producers who are not within the scheme, namely Siam and Burma, and they produce a certain amount of tin, and there is of course the possibility that the same tiling may happen as what happened in respect to rubber, you may have an increase in the countries to which the scheme is not applicable., but it is hoped to bring those places in.    I am told that Cornwall is not likely to produce again unless the price is  200 a ton, and it is a long way from that now.   The scheme is to be-administered by a Committee of all the countries concerned with experts to help them, and it is hoped that they will not act simply as policemen to see the scheme Is carried out, but that they will be able to do something for research generally and also in stimulating the Consumption of tin.*-See page 42.
9 9 9(j cjMR. GILLETT:   What chance is there of getting these other countries into the scheme?MR. VERNON:    I think the people in the industry are hopeful.    It is not a Government scheme, but the mining companies1 and producers&apos;   scheme, and they are hopeful of bringing in Burma and Siam, and they do not think China1 s production is very important.When you are dealing with China you are dealing with small producers and it is difficult to get them into the scheme. You have not a large concern which covers the whole ground.MR. GILLETT:    Do you know what proportion of the world production they cover, those who are in the scheme?MR. VERNOft:    The percentage would be about 92$.    I am not quite certain of the exact figure.MR, MITCHELL:  (CHAMBER OF COaiiJERGE):    As regards the Scottish coal trade, negotiations - for a wages arrangement have been proceeding satisfactorily, and an agreement will probably be completed this week for an extension of the existing arrangement until 30T.U June,    There is little change in the sales position. The cold weather has helped the sales of house coal but there are large stocks in wagons of small coal.   There is no improvement in local works consumption.There is no improvement in export,    Poland is still taking nearly all the business open and practically no sales have been made forward for shipment *   It is reported that there has been a reduction in railway rates from Poland to the Baltic ports. The outlook is generally very unsatisfactory c    The shipments for the week to the 7th March were 182^399 tons, compared with 204,647 for   the    previous week and 231,423 tons for the corresponding week in 1930.An old established colliery concern in Lanarkshire has found it impossible to continue and has gone into liquidation.   This is serious for the district, falling as It does on the liquidation of the group of collieries to which I referred at the last meeting,.   Unfortunately a water question arises and there may be a heavy permanent loss of coal in the West of Scotland,The output remains much the same, the figures for the week to 21st February being 624,600 tons and to tho 28th February 601,300 tons.   You will notice that there is a smaller output in the alternate weeks which is due to the idle Saturday, more collieries being idle on one Saturday in the fortnight than on the other.   There is no improvements in the coke market.as regards pig Iron the production in Scotland in January was 15,500 tons, the same as in December, compared with 50,400 tons for January 1930.   The import of foreign pig Iron into Scotland In January was 13,16b tons being rather less than in December.   Of the quantity in January 4,125 tons were from India. ij-here is no improvement In the position generally.As regards steel, the production in January was 47,400 compared with 99,300 tons in January 1930.    Much tine has been lost at the steel works.    Very few shipbuilding orders have been placed and there are no signs of any improvement.   Engineer!;!!
9 9 /?fcJ *-j (siworks allied to shipbuilding are suffering from shortage of work.    The imports of steel into Scotland in January were 88,442 tons as compared with 33,237 tons in December, but January is a holiday month.Scrap continues to be very plentiful.   The imports into Scotland in January were 1,017 tons and the exports 1,862 tons.   For the whole country the exports in January largely exceeded the imports.   The    tube trade  shows no improvement and there is much idle time in the tube works.In examining the figures for production for the whole country for 1930 as compared with 1929,, it would appear that this country shows a larger relative decrease in pig iron than any large producing country except the united States of America, and in steel a larger relative decrease than any country except Germany and the United States, and it should be noted that the decrease in these countries is from a comparatively high level of production.    Russia produced more pig iron and steel in November than Great Britain and the five year plan contemplates a production of pig iron more than double the normal production in this country.    This will be a serious menace to the trade of the country.    For 1930 the exports of iron and steel show a relatively larger decrease compared with 1929 in Britain than in any other large exporting country except the bnited States,  and much larger if the later months in the year are taken by themselves.    I have no report from outside districts.MR. FOLLETT HOLT:    Beyond the facts that I put in the memorandum-:!- which I have handed in I do not think there is anything much l can add.    There seem to be signs of improvement throughout the Continent of South America at the present time. The exchanges have improved during the last month in two of the countries.    The outstanding event at the moment is the Buenos -&quot;-yres Exhibition which represents i should think the biggest trade push that has ever been made in any foreign country or any other country.    There are a thousand British exhibitors there. You may be interested to know - probably you do know already, Sir - that there nave been some reports in the Press saying that the Exhibition would not be ready for Saturday.    I have-it on the best authority of Sir Herbert Gibson that the Exhibition will be complete and in good order ready for opening on Saturday, and the Prince of Wales has expressed his content-ment with the organisation and preparation.    I think it is entirely satisfactory.   Beyond that ^ have nothing to say. We have had some 2,500 men working at the Exhibition in the last few days - that alone means chaos.MR. GILLETT:    We can only hope that it will turn out to be the great success that is expected.&amp;R. CAIRNS:    The main part of my report for last month deals with figures and these I propose just to hand in. They have been prepared to show that there has been a heavy fall in our sales which have been due not to the quantities handled   being less but by lower prices.    On the productive side things have been less satisfactory,    j^t the Tweed mill the carding and spinning section has been closed down definitely and in boots and shoes the production is about 10/ lower than last year which may seem contradictory, but we find that our members meantime probably on account of trie scarcity of money are inclined to buy goods of a cheaper quality than it is our custom to make.*-See page 27.-12-
9 O r*^ oJIn confirmation of what .Ir9 Mitchell said about coal last month,  the amount of coal sold during the month was 41,335 tons of household coal and the average price at the pit was 20/4^-de and the reports we receive are that the scarcity of orders for export Is causing home coal to be pressed on the market and although the quality of the shipping coal is Inferior It tends to keep down the price of household coal.     The rest I will hand in, Mr. Chairman.&apos;&apos;1IR. VARLEY:    As far as the co-operative movement on this side of the border is concerned,  the money values are down but the quantities of goods are up.    For instance in sugar compared with 12 months ago the money value is down 3.3 per cent whereas the quantity is up by 1.1 per cent. Butter and margarine values are down 1208 per cent and the increase in quantity is up by 12^&apos;jo    In flour the values are down 42.1 per cent but the quantities are up 5.5 per cent. Tea is down both in value and in weight and bacon and hams are down 24.4 per cent but up in weight 32^ and grain Is down both In weight and in valueo    That is all probably because farmers are finding it quite profitable to use their own gr?,in for the feeding of their cattle rather than buying it on the market.    The retail and wholesale prices are both down and they are going downs    The wholesale prices are down more than the retail prices.    I have some comparisons here -I will not trouble you with them for the moment.    There has been an Increased enquiry for unsalted butter from Belgium, France and Switzerland for the first 2 weeks resulting in advances of 7/- and l4/3d* per cwt.    These sudden advances have not been expected and consequently demand has again fallen away, resulting In reductions of 9/Sd, and 7/- during the past fortnights    The prices of butter are coming nearer together than they were in the last 3 or 4 weeks.    Danish is 144/-, Swedish 154/6dj Finnish 1S2/-, Her; Zealand 124/- and Australian 123/3do    As far as cheese is concerned we have had rather a novel experience.   We have been sending fairly large consignments of Cheshire cheese into the United States of Americae    With regard to eggs fresh supplies have come forward freely and values have eased almost dailyc    They are offering around ll/6do Manchester.    Refined sugar is unchanged.    Reduced acreage in the United Kingdom and on the Continent and decisions as to other restrictions expected next month may firm up the market,, but at the moment the tone is very depressed.   With regard to canned goods the trade is rather from hand to mouth.    There have been very few changes in market quotations.   Australian fruits have been sold at very low prices and must have meant a great los3 to the sellers. These sales have had no effect on&apos; Calif omian prices, which remain steady, and packers who have unsold stocks are not pressing for orders.    Italian tomatoes are firm to dearer, as packers have now reduced their stocks which were packed for the American market.    The Spanish tomatoes of a special size of can have been offered on the English market and South America has failed to take them up.    The unsold Canadian salmon Scckeye i&apos;s is reported to have changed hands at about 4 dollars a case (of 4 dozen tins) below the opening price.      Stocks of Canadian lobsters in Importers hands are heavy and are offered at a considerable reduction because the new pack will be hero in 2 months time.    Singapore pines are very cheap and retailers seem to ha&apos;re taken up the selling of the larger sizes and instead of as In tho past Hawaiian and South African.    Tea - there is an easier te::&quot;.ency reported last month which has continued, offerings remaining heavy and quality generally indifferent.*See page 20.-13-
9 Q PO eO $Wheat is about Sd* a quarter higher on the month. Exporting countries are fighting very hard to maintain prices, but their position is an extremely difficult one owing to excessive supplies.     -Canada and the united States of America are bearing the brunt of efforts to maintain -orices.    Canadian wheat being the dearest, most of the trade goes to other countries.    In the United States the Farm Board announce that they will cease  to  support  the market after Hay.    They want to sell S3 million bushels for shipment in the next three or four months but buyers in Europe are not interested as the wheat is two or three years old,    Russia is still offering freely and willing to meet buyers&quot;  ideas in regard to price.    From Australia there are good supplies now afloat, which will have to be sold as they get nearer to United Kingdom ports.    Indiay  the natives are making It difficult for wheat to be shipped.    Accumulations are deteriorating owing to lack of export trade.    In the Argentine they are meeting the market and selling all the time. Qualities are not so high owing to web weather during the harvesting period, bub the curious thing is that that weather has benefited, maize while it has lowered the quality of wheat.    The crop of maize is abnormally large which means cheap supplies for some time to come.Boots and shoes and general furnishing are generally down because of the bad trade especially in Lancashire and the ilorth.In the domestic coal trade owing to the quota system there has been an accumulation of Industrial fuel, at a large number of collieries and restrictions have been imposed reducing the outputs, and this has very largely affected the tra.de in domestic coal and made it difficult to work.    In fact the Society has not been able  to satisfy requirements. There have been a few alterations In prices which operated on and from Wednesday February 18th, but these are only adjustments again owing to the 1 line a Act.    In a few cases there have been advances of l/- per ton in others Id. per ton and In some qualities reductions of the above named amounts so it will be noticed that there Is very little change that matters.   We are having difficulty with the quota system.   We have had to buy quotas and- we have difficulties In getting the domestic coal from collieries where we have been in the habit of getting it in large supplies and we have had to run about from this colliery to that colliery and in our own colliery we have had to buy quotas for the purpose of supplying us with what we require.In our export department, using the sma.ll items of export for co-operative organisations, again there is some Australian butter going into Germanyc    Last time I said there was some going to Czechoslovakia.    This month we have sent some  to Germany and to Russia..    Our total   exports of jute, margarine and spices have been  105,836.    I have a return which I will put in&quot; of the amount of Russian grain exported through the Russian Grain Exporting Association in which we are about half shareholders and this shows that  the amount of Russian grain shipped during the week from 9 th to 13th February was 72;975 tons, and from the 1st July,   the beginning of  the wheat oeascn they have exported 1,493,190 tons of which 1,091,215  tons were wheat or 75/.    The rest is barley, oats, maize, peas,  etc.-&quot;-See page 40.
Russia is buying sugar in large quantities a,s well as shipping sugar and it may interest the Council to l:nor? that the manager of our tea gardens In India has been in Russia now for about 4 to 5 months showing the Russians how to grow tea, so that they will supply themselves with tea in the next five or six years rather than buy it from outside.1IR. GILLETT:    The quality of sugar imported and exported is different, I take it?1&quot;R, VARLEY:    Yes.    They were exporting some sometime ago which had a peculiar flavour with it.    It was loaf sugar packed in bags, and they were exporting it via Alexandria and it was put Into bags so as to be able to put it on camels&apos; backs to go into the Sudan.    That was so with a fairly large consign-ment two months ago.SIR ERNEST GLOVERi    Where Is it proposed to grow this tea in Russia?hRa VARLEY:    I am not quite sure, but I think towards the South of Siberia, or down Georgia way and that district.:iR; KILTOH;    Light I ask one question?    Er. Varley mentioned that Russia was saving a considerable quantity of wheat for salec    Is that wheat to be shipped or is it shipped and on the way?EE. VARLEY:    The figures I have here for the quantities of grain unshipped are 42,000  tons.&quot;Iu HILTOHi    Still to be shipped?EH. YAELEY:    Tea, but there is only 12,000  cons of wheat unshipped;  the rest is chiefly cotton seod and soya beans.SIR EPITLST GLOVER:    The reason I asked was  that so far as reduction of tonnage is concerned the last week or two Russia has absolutely stopped chartering any great tonnagec    I wondered whether  their sales were of cereals already shipped or waiting to be shipped.:iRo VARLEYi    These are figures to the 13th February and of course Soya beans come from the other side.    They have been doing a, large business in soya beans -ER. HILT01T:    hay not  the explanation of the export and import of sugar at the same time be that by a dual arrangement they get an extension of credit?ER. VARLEY:    I do not know,    It is done through the Grain Association,    I suppose they will bej getting credit for the 140,000  cons of sugar that I mentioned, but I am not so sure of that particular item.ER0 GILLETT:    I understood it was tho refined sugar we sent in and it was  the much rougher kind of sugar  they sent out.
0 () OfcJ (6 OLIEU VARLEY:    Yes,    There Is 154,000  tons of crystal sugar going through the Department today.ALDER: AH TITTSRINGTON:    There has been a remarkable recovery in wool prices since the latter half of January. The demand for wool in all the primary markets has been extraordinarily keen, and fresh advances have taken place from week to week.    The Bradford market has had to follow the rise and prices of Ilerino tops are about 5d. above the lowest point., whilst crossbred tops are fully 2d.  to 3d. per lbQ above the lowest point.    The advance has been accompanied by a good deal of business, particularly in merino tops.    Users who were sceptical about the recovery have been eventually forced to buy.    At the London sales on Tuesday last prices were 15  to 20^ above the previous sales which closed on February 6 th.    The unusually rapid rise makes It extremely Improbable that we shall see a   ,return to the uneconomic prices pi&apos;evailing in the first half of January.    A restoration of confidence in values has been sorely needed, and. It will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the whole of the industry.    The improvement in machinery activity in the past few weeks has been probably in excess of the usual seasonal expansion which we are accustomed to see at this period of  the year,    herino combers and botany spinners are quite busy, but on the other hand the crossbred section,   though busier,  is still-under employed.    In the manufacturing section worsteds are being more favoured than woollens.    One notices in Scotland and Yorkshire there have been some suggestions for some Delegation to go to Canada and America with the Overseas Department.lie. GILLSTT;    They are there now.ALDERMAN TITTERIHGTOHs    The Yorkshire people have not taken steps at the moment.    The Trade Unions in the dying industry have turned down the employers proposals for a 10/ reduction in wages and negotiations have broken down.I was just wondering whether relative  to the reference made to cotton exports dorm to the VJool Fair which is to be held shortly, whether your Department might not consider the advisability of both sides co-ordinating so that there may be only one Fair each year-.,    They will not trouble to come to two separate -Fairs and there is definitely a duplication of exhibitions,    I think it might be advisable If the Department like your own were to moke only one Fair of the two industries, and I  think that would be a good suggestion.    I will hand in statistics in the usual way.LIRo GILLETT;    I understand on the last point Lord Derby referred to it at the Cotton Fair Luncheon where he suggested that all the various industries concerned ought to exhibit together.ALDSRMAH TITTERINGTOiTj    I find it arising out of our oral difficultieso    I was at the Cotton Exhibition and we were Interested both on the cotton and woollen sides, and we thought it would be rather a good suggestion.    In Yorkshire we are spending a good deal of  time on the wool F^Jir and there Is duplication which might well be avoided.
NR. GILLETT:    I rather think it is being considerednow,ALDERIIAN TITTERINGTON:    If it could be held annually it would be a good thing,:.IR0 GILLETT j    It is a question v/hether it can be amalgamated in London with respecting.ect to the British Industries Fair..ALDERIIAN TITTERINGTON:    They might come to Hanchester or Bradford, I think.SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD: There is nothing very much to say about Piailways, and what I have to say is not very encouraging,.      The figures for February as regards revenue show a continued decline as compared with last year and the decline is more marked than in January.    Taking the passenger receipts for the four main line companies the decline for the month of February is 3-gr per cent.;,  for the month of January it was about S per cent a, for merchandise the decline is 15z Per cento in February which Is tho same as in January. In coal and coke the decline is IO-3- per cent,  as compared with 8* per cent,  in January,    That is more striking as the January figures include large quantities during tho strike in South Wales.    As to tonnage as distinct from receipts the figures show an even more marked decline.    I can only give them for the whole of the period up to the end of February.      Since the beginning of the year merchandise shows - the higher class merchandise - shows a decrease of 17 per cent,  and the lower class of merchandise for the first&apos;ski classes which you call minerals, show a decrease of about 25 per1 cent.    The coal and coke decrease is 20 per cento    The shipments of coal handled by the London and North Eastern and Great Western Railways -tho two principal coal shipping companies, show a decline of 35 per cent.    Altogether the picture is not a very encouraging one at the time,  although the reports we have from our areas all round show that there is a better condition prevailing in industry, rather a, more hopeful spirit, but that will take some time to reflect Itself in the railway carriage.    It may interest you to hear that as regards sugar beet we are advised that as the result of the new Government offer a satisfactory agreement has boen reached &quot;between the growers and the companies except the Anglo Dutch Union who cannot offer satisfactory terms to the growersa    The railway companies-have agreed to offer a ilower scale of rates than hitherto operating in East Anglia for the carriage of sugar beet all over the country*    That means a reduction of 10 per cento That was done in agreement with the beet companies in order to enable them to come to a satisfactory bargain with the growers.    They undertake that the hole of the benefit shall go to the growers.DRo CLAYTON?    In the chemical industry there has been no change in tho month and I have nothing really to add to the report made last monthc    There Is, however.,  one thing I have been asked to report,and that is by a chemical manufacturer in Yorkshire;,    He reports that he has been encountering difficulties as the result of the operation of the quota system under the Goal Nines Act,      He has a standing contract with a local colliery for 500 tons of coal a month v In February the colliery could only supply 300  tons and he has to purchase 200 tons in the open market which he was able to
o ydo under slightly increased cost.    This month the quota has been reduced and the. colliery can only deliver 200 tons.    He has therefore to buy 300 tons on the open market and he finds a great many other people are in the same condition, with the result that the prices in view of competition heve gone up.    He admits that there might be adequate quantities of coal in the country, but if so they are not available in Yorkshire, and there seems to be no machinery by which a surplus in one part may be made available in another without putting up the price.    I was asked to bring this to your notice and I can give you the name of the manufacturer who reports it and he says there are a number of other cases in his district.    we are trying to look into that to get particulars for you.MR. GILLETT:    I understand the committee of the coal owners who are supposed to arrange this arranged with the owners of the districts at the beginning of January how much would be allowed,    I do not understand this - if they had a standing order for your friend why they did not take note of it and supply it.DR. CLAYTON:    I do not know.      This is a definite case of a man who writes that it is his own experience.    He has a 500 tons contract and cannot get it delivered.MR. GILLETT;    v?e will take note of it and send it to the Mines Department.DR. CLAYTON %    I will give you the name of the manufacturer,MR. MITCHELL:    In Yorkshire by reason of the short hours they are short of coal.SIR ERNEST GLOVER:    Is it true that a cargo of coal is being shipped from Poland to Grimsby owing to the shortage in Yorkshire?MR. GILLETT:    That I am afraid I cannot give you information upon.     ie will send Dr.  Clayton&apos;s case to the Mines Department.    If there is any other case to be looked into end we can have particulars we shall a ttend to it.(The Council then adjourned).NOTE:    Dr.  Clayton has supplied the following information on the questions asked by the President during last Advisory Council Meeting regarding the Russian tender for a Japanese order (see page 3 of the Minutes for February 12th, A.0.220).&quot;The two questions that have&quot; been asked are (l) what was the size of the Russian order;    and (*) whether the situation in Japan arises as part of the general programme or whether it is due to a shortage of cash.(l) The size of the order is 20,000 tons Caustic Soda.(2)  It is part of the Five Year Programme.    Under this programme the Chemical Section is in advance of the other works contemplated,  due to the fact that the Chemical works vvere stolen from the Solway Company as a going concern.    They are therefore producing in a dvance of the consuming factories and have the product available for export.    In Japan the Russian Government have purchased a lr-rge quantity of tea, and
O ej JLin payment for this would, if they paid by bill, suffer a discount of 22 per  cent.      Paying by means of import of Caustic Soda they save this 22 per cent,  and therefore do not make as great a loss as would appear from the figures we hear have been quoted.&quot;/Corrigendum:*   The word &quot;sulphate1 in line 26 on page    3 of A.C. 220 should be &quot;SolwayJ/.
MR. CAIRNS HANDED IN THE FOLLOWING REPORT:-v ^ w tj i&apos;during last month the average level of prices pertaining to the staple articles of food has undergone no material change. Due to incidental and temporary causes prices in one or two instances exhibited a spurt of increase which was soon checked and the price made to revert to a point much nearer that from which it started than that to which it had reached.Butter afforded one of those instances.      In three successive weeks Danish advanced 26/- per cwt0 but during the last fortnight it has receded 15/- the reason advanced for the upward movement was that severe weather in Holland had made the production of Dutch unusually small and had driven ?.nto the Danish market, Prance, Belgium and Switzerland countries in which Dutch butter is substantially consumeds     Butter from Australia and New Zealand continues to arrive in considerable quantities but stimulated by its good quality demand has been sufficient to maintain the price at an average increase of 5/- per  cwt.Comparison of prices:-4th March, 2931,    4th March, 1930Danish ..................    145/- per cwta      176/- per cwtaNev/ Zealand ........... , 0    128/-    &quot;      11 155/-    &quot;      &quot;Though the price of Granulated Sugar is 2/4-1 Per cwta less than it was a year ago the undertone of the market is stronger since the date of the last report and it is stated that the final arrangements are being made for putting into operation the scheme for the restriction of crops in the producing countries.Home  cheddar cheese are now in short supply and the price is approximately 22/.- per cwt. less than a year ago. Canadian cheese are not plentiful, and at the current price of 77/&quot; per cwt0 are 26/&apos;- less In price than a year agoc Contrary to expectations the demand for New Zealand cheese has improved and the price has :.advanced to 64/- per cwta representing an increase of 8/- per cwt0Supplies of Eggs are Increasing aided it is presumed by the  cheapness of feeding stuffs for poultry,,      The recent fall in prices has been 2/- per hundred practically 2gd per doza      Hams and Bacon are lower in price.      Irish smoked hams from our own factory at Enniskilien are priced at 125/- per cwts as against 175/- a year  ago,     Ayrshire bacon from cur own factory at Kilmarnock is priced at l/-id per lbD as against 1/S%6\ a year ago.     Really good Scotch cats are very scarce  owing to the bad weather- in- harvest last year and the price of Scotch oatmeal is a little higher, but it  cannot go much up as the supplies of German and Canadian are plentiful at prices ranging from 2/6d to 5/- per  sack below the Scotch.Rargcon rice has made a new record of low price and the standa.ru quality known as &quot;two star1&apos; is down to 7/Sd per cwt0 In the mean,  staple articles of Green Fruit show a reduction of four per  cent a on the prices current . a year ago0     Apples, Banaiiofij Grapes, Lemons and Pears are  cheaper, while Onions and Oranges are dearer though In no case except grapes is the difference  considerable.Throughout last month there was little  change In the values of wheat.      Quotations in Chicago are 18 cents per
bushel higher for Kay wheat than in explained by the action of the Ameri &quot;pagans&quot; tne Pri06 in that country, any material change In the price of two factors one that the prospect of to exist for a considerable time and consumption of bread per head of the tendency to fall are effective in p;Winnipeg the difference being can Farm Relief Board inThere is no appearance of wheat at an early date, the large supplies will continue the other that the population still exhibits a eventing an upward movement.The Potato Department is experiencing a welcome change from the  conditions of last year.     There is a good demand from the South of England, for all va vie ties and at the moment large quantitits are being shipped to that part of the  country at an increase of 30/- per ton on recent prices.      Seed potatoes have also had a good market and should the present demand from theis a fairly sure prospect that stocks in cleared at the end of the season.South continue there is a Scotland will have been wellThe following statement of consumption show that the measured in cash sales falls prices.

The scar-city of orders for export is causing shipping coal to be pressed upon the home market and this  circumstance although the quality of the shipping coal is inferior tends to keep down the price of household coal.The position at the Jute ..dll is putting   -forth signs of improvement.     ioa agreement has been reached by the Calcutta Jute quills association on the question ox reducing production and it is expected that an effect of what has been done will be a reduction of output to the extent of 50 per cent, for the remainder of this year.     Already in view of a steady reduction of stocks which it is the aim of the agreement to accomplish various classes of buyers have entered the market with enquiries.

G00DSN0UGH sent the following reportThe firmer tendency in short term money rates which was apparent towards the close of January and in the early part of February has  continued throughout the past month and., on the wholej supplies of floating credits have been on a comparatively restricted scale n      The  operations of the tax collector, which usually are strongly in evidence at this season of the year,  -have helped to withdraw funds from the market whilst, from time to time, -sales of bills by special quarters have effectively prevented any tendency which might otherwise have existed fox1 credits to be greatly in excess of the demand,, On the other hand, any danger of the market having to borrow from the Bank of England has been avoided through special purchases of bills, the supply of funds having been regulated so that whilst there has been no actual stringency, firm rates have been maintained.. This position has naturally been reflected in the discount market and in spite of a rather short supply of paper, the rate for three months1 fine bank bills, which, a month ago, was 27/16 - 2-!; is now 25/8 after having been as high as 2-l-1/l6 - 2-f Quotations in London are still appreciably above the corresponding rates in New York, Paris and Amsterdam, with the
0 9e*ij ci ijconsequence that there has been a certain amount of foreign buying of bills in the London market.This movement has been reflected in the foreign exchanges where a rather larger volume of business has been transacted. The franc, in particular, has depreciated, the quotation having risen to over 124 for the first time since April 1930, At the same time, in terms of most of the leading exchanges, sterling still stands at a discount and as the recently published estimates of the oountry&apos;s invisible earnings for 1930 indicate, the trading depression has seriously curtailed Great Britain&apos;s ability to lend abroad.There has been no recurrence of the heavy gold withdrawals from the Bank of England during the past month, the amounts which have been taken being comparatively insignificant. Nevertheless, the increase in the Central gold reserves has been relatively small, as practically all the open market supplies have been taken for export.     On March 4th, the gold held in the Issue Department of the Bank of England was  140.9 millions compared with  140.4 millions on February 4th and, in the circumstances, the necessity for maintaining the margin between effective money rates in London and other important international monetary centres needs no emphasis.Business on the Stock Exchange has been affected by the imminence of the Budget and by fears of increased taxation, although a more confident feeling has recently prevailed. Gilt edged securities at one time suffered a sharp setback and although an improvement subsequently ocourred, most prices are lower on balance.SIR GUY GRANET sent the following reports-The precarious state of the French and American Exchanges for the greater part of the past month has made it necessary for the Bank of England to take an active part in maintaining the market bill rate which has been about 2$/8% since February 21st.     Although from the beginning of Jiarch until the 9th instant money was temporarily comparatively comfortable the authorities have been able to maintain this quotation without difficulty.Notwithstanding the fact that the above rate compares very favourably with 1^% in New York and 1^/16% in Paris, it has not exerted the influence on the flow of short term money to London one might expect, and this is to some extent due to the high premium on what is called covering the foreign exchange risk,,     when buying bills foreign banks reconvert the necessary purchases of sterling, which must precede their buying here;, into their own currencies by means of forward contracts, and when the forward exchange stands at a premium over spot the loss incurred by this reconversion diminishes the yield of their London investment.      In the case of Paris lt.vreduces the London yield to about 2% and the New York Banker received about 2-g% per annum after covering the exchange.     However, owing to the low rates for money prevailing in the above centres the net rates mentioned have recently been high enough to keep the sterling exchange above the point at which gold shipments from London would be profitable, but it will be necessary to maintain money rates
here at a higher level than either Paris or New York until such time as a revival in trade adjusts the position.-Incidentally the Anglo French Treasury conversations appear to have improved official relations between the two centres with benefit to the working of the immediate exchange problem.     The situation is one that calls for confidence and co-operation, as without these it is not possible to work an international gold standard.Business in the Stock Exchange has recently been a little more active and there are signs of returning confidence.      The Naval Pact, between France and Italy, the Indian agreement, and at home the resumption of work in the cotton trade and the possibility of acceptance of the Railway wages award have all contributed to a brighter outlook in the Stock iiarkets, although prices in the Industrial markets will not show any material change until there is evidence of a definite revival in trade.New Capital issues for trade purposes amounted to less than - 6,000,000 for the month of February and compared with  30,000,000 for the corresponding month in 1928 is fairly indicative of the shrinkage that has taken place in this department of industrial financing.MR. HILTON handed in the following report on Employment in February, 1931:-There was some further fluctuation during February in the numbers on the registers of Employment Exchanges which resulted in a net increase during the month of 10,338.     At 2nd February, the total was 2,624,236.      In the following week there was a rise of about 13,000 followed by two successive falls of 6,000 and 13,500.      In the last week of the month, however, there was a further rise of 17,COO to a total of 2,634,574.The net rise of 10,338 during the month occurred almost entirely in the numbers wholly unemployed,      The numbers temporarily stopped increased by only 366.The number of men on the Register increased by 40,409, the number of women decreased by 19,189 and the number of juveniles decreased by 10,882.In every Division except Wales (where there was a oontinuous increase)  of the numbers unemployed fluctuated during the month and the net variations were as follows:-Among the principal industries employment ^e^ederc:ireeI.ing between 26th January and 23rd February in &quot; ^eSSirSS and motor vehicle manufacture,  shipbuilding and ship W^^Snf Jn in the distributive trades.

SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.IvlR. FOLLFTT HOLT handed in the following Report dated the 11th of March:-Revolutions have for many months disturbed trading conditions in South America.    Their origin was to a large extent economic but the re-adjustment of public and private expenditure to the lower range of commodity prices is taking place and although there has been a further outburst in Peru,  tired consider ate ly to take place after the Price of wales visit, it seems generally speaking that the Continent is settling down once again.The Prince&apos;s visit is    an invaluable aid to our trade interests and with the British Empire Exhibition in Buenos Aires is stirring the activities of our people at home and on the Continent in a welcome way.The valuable Report of the Sheffield Industrial Eission to South America has been published.    The recommendations made might well be considered by other trades.The importance of maintaining in full and renewed vigour our shipping lines to South America is obvious,    Ho effort should be spared - even by the Government if need he - to rescue the most important combination (the Royal Mail) from its distressing difficulties.The Argentine Navigation Company  ( 2,500,000), which largely controls the Argentine, Uruguay and Pa.ra.guay river traffic, now foes into liquidation the control passing from London to Argentina,,    This came about by the difficulties refers^red to.ARGENTINA.The figures for 19^0 are now available .    As compared with the previous year, exports fell by 5*7 million tons or 34J&apos;5  cereals and linseed alone accounting for 5.5 million tons.   Values fell 59 million sterling, or 50f.    Amongst exports, meat dropped 49,000 tons or 7f, but the total value at 26 million sterling  only declined 2.2??.To produce revenue and check intports increased and new duties have been imposed.To give an idea of Argentina&apos;s volume of business, there are about 4 million tons of-wheat,  1-f million linseed and possibly 6 million or more tons of maize still to export this year .Dr. Joseph Schilling of the Reichsbank has arrived at Buenos Aires to advise on the internal organisation of the Banco de la iMacion,Exchange has been well handled during the past month. The peso has steadily risen from 35 pence to 39 pence.The outlook generally ha,s much improved and the Country is enjoying at the moment a wavelet of optimism.The menace is the price of Russian wheat when it arrives on the market.
URUGUAY. 9j nBased on par rate of exchange trading figures for the year 1930 show a balance in favour of Uruguay of about  2,450,,000 as against an unfavourable balance of  4-17,000 for the year 1929.    Great Britain continues to be Uruguay&quot;s best customer, with figures shewing increased imports and exports.Practically all the wool clip has been sold., but under excessive rain the wheat and linseed crops are poor,CHILE cThe political situation of the country remains undisturbed.The Nitrate industry continues to be depresseda    The &quot;Cosaoh&quot; scheme to combine State and private interests in the industry is still going towards what is described as a &quot;satisfactory&quot;  conclusion.Copper exports for the first eleven -uvn&apos;Ah   of 1930 amounted to 194,000 tons, a decrease of 103*000 tons on the same period of 1929 9 low prices still prevailing,,Additional tariffs came into force on the 7th February on foreign articles similar to those manufactured in Chile, on luxury articles the increase being 555$, on necessities 20%,brazil tCoffee remains the acute problem,-,    Some idea of this can be gathered from the figures for the first ten months of 1929 and 1930.1929. 1950.Bags exported..........      llv746p000     12,560,000Value..,,.........,.,.,     58 ,,905,, 000    35,253,000Average price per bag,.  5  2.16.0To clear the decks the Federal Government now propose to purchase the balance, (outside of that held by San Paulo) of all coffee available on June the 30th next;, price being based on a certain type at 20/- per bag.Hitherto official control of coffee prices has led to unrestricted additional planting.    Now each new tree  (not a replacement) is to be taxed?  and therefore increased production restricted.Shipment by growers of the new crop, beginning on the 1st of July next, will be permitted under the sole restric-tion that the monthly quota will not exceed one twenty-fourth of the estimated new and following crops.The balance of trade for the twelve months ended December 1930, was  12/151,000 in favour of Brazil,The Provisional Government retain the reins of office-28-
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.During the four weeks ended 1st March, 1931,  the railway traffic receipts of the four amalgamated companies-&quot;- shewed a decrease compared with the corresponding period of 19^0 at  1,427,000,    This decrease is made up as follows:-  Per cent.Passenger train traffic.,.,.,.      299,000 6.51Freight train traffic: Merchandise, minerads and live stock,..,,......797,000 15,7?Coal, coke and patent fuel...      ?71,000 10.591,427,000 11.16The receipts for the nine weeks ended 1st March, 19?1, compared with the corresponding period of 19?0,  shew a decrease of  5,006,000 made up as follows,-  Per cent.Passenger train traffic......      6^0,000 5.98Freight train traffic: Merchandise,; minerals and live stock,...,...,...,....  1,754,000 15.79Coal,  coke and patent fuel.. _622.000 9.12r-,,006,,000 10.56-:;For the separate figures for each Company see&quot; p.46&quot;and appear to be getting, the Country back to a more normal state of affairs politically, and are endeavouring to construct measures of financial reform.COLOMBIAoThe outlook is a little more favourable, prices of Colombian coffee being less affected by the Brazilian position the Government continues to cut expenditure in order to balance the Budget,    The new Petroleum law is expected to re-act very favourably upon the Country&apos;s finances.    A project to convert the State Railways into autonomous concerns has now be c ome 1 aw.Intercommunication by aeroplane,  already well developed, is being further extended.Colombia is remarkable in South America in as far that no depreciation has occurred in the currency, but in maintaining this position the gold reserves of the Banco de la Republioa have been depleted since ?lst December,  19^0, by  1,077,000. It is expected that a further drain upon the gold reserve will be avoided by the completion of an arrangement with the Swedish hatch Company,  the latter providing a loan of  2,000,000 and paying  in return for a match, monopoly a sum yearly sufficient to pay the interest and to amortise the loan over a period of ten years.SIR CTRIL HARC0URT sent the following statement:-
The preliminary figures for the year 1930 shew that the total nrunber of passenger journeys taken ever all the railways in Great britain (excluding the London Tubes and Metropolitan District Railway) was 27,956,000 or 2 per cent, less than in 1929.    The revenue from passengers, however, shewed a reduction of five per cent, swing to the fact that in 1930 there was a still further falling off in the proportion of passengers carried at ordinary fares.The tonnage oonveyed on freight trains in 1930 was 25.7243,000 less than in 1929,,  a reduction of over 7ljr per cent. The traffics which contributed principally to this reduction were : -Decrease^ y?.5^ ,1930, oomparea&quot;&apos;wlth&quot; 1929 ,	Tons ,	per cGoal, coke and patent fuel.	13,875,500	6,70Iron and Steel............ ,	2,964,500	17 ,47	2,477,600	19 ,80Iir*oiij jpi^j^a * * * ^ * 0 * * * * * * * * * *	1,108,300	28 ,15	714s000	14,19These figures reflect the depression in the iron and steel and coal industries.Motor Industry.The number of motor vehicles  (excluding motor cycles) newly registered in January 1931, was 1,164 less than in the corresponding period of 1950.

MR. LENNOX LEE handed in the following report;-After twelve or thirteen months during which prices declined almost continuously, with the exception of some re-action during October, the firmness Of cotton futures during February, with consequent greater confidence, led to some improvement in business notwithstanding the stoppage arising out of the more-looms-to-a-weaver dispute.The tight spot position at Alexandria and the better tone on Wall Street and in the manufacturing industry of the United States seems to have been largely responsible for the firmness of cotton futures.     Prices of American cotton advanced in sympathy with Egyptian.     Fully good fair Sakellaridis was quoted on spot at Liverpool on January 31st. at 8.95d;    on the 5th of February it rose to above 9d and on the 23rd cf the month it was quoted at over 10d.     Middling American on spot in similar fashion opened the month at 5,69d., rose to over 6d on the 18th and on the 27th the price was 6.18d.     This hardening tendency was soon reflected in the greater interest which buyers showed in yarns and cloth of most descriptions.In the Bleaching section of the trade receipts and deliveries of cloth were oh a much smaller scale than during January and although an improvement took place during -the second half of the month the quantity of cloth coming forward is still considerably less than in recent months. The shortage of grey cloth, following the weavers stoppage, also resulted in a shrinkage of work in the dyeing department of the trade.      On the other hand Printers, on the whole, report that production was slightly greater than during the preceding mon; h.A large proportion of the business done at the exhibition has been for the Home Trade, Colonial and Continental Account, and on the Manchester Royal Exchange both the Home and Continental Trade have provided a useful flow of orders., Domestic demand has&apos;been largely for the plainer standard styles and for making-up cloths, while Scandinavia has bought fine goods and fancies and finishing cloths have been booked for Central Europe.Demand from India for piece goods has shown an upward tendency.     Stocks are low and clearances have tended to improve.     The Boycott position, however, still remains obscure and it is not yet certain what effect &quot;peaceful picketing within the limits of ordinary law&quot; will have upon future business with that market.v/ith increased import duties and the continued low price of silver, China has given little support during the month.Some amount of business was done for Egypt in the early part of February but towards the end of the month African and Near Eastern Markets generally did not show much activity.Reports from South and Central America and, in particular from the Argentine, are rather more cheerful and, although the buying this season has been on a much smaller scale than last
year, stocks are low and it is the general opinion that the 1931/32 season will show improvement.      The fall.in the value of the milreis is preventing business with Brazil and until an improvement takes place there is little likelihood of much enquiry for Cotton piece Goods,     An improvement has taken place in the commercial situation in Colombia and some fair orders have been placed for that market during the month. Competition is still very keen in Peru especially from the U.S.A,, Italy and Czecho-Slcvakia.MR.  LINDSAY handed in the following tables: -I. Quantities of Staple Exports from India.

CAPT. LYTTLETON sent the following report:-Copjger.     It is difficult to see any signs of a general revival in consumption,  though some heavy Continental buying came forward at the end of February.Wiredrawers in Liverpool have placed substantial orders, but are now for the moment rather over-bought,      Birmingham and Swansea report very little new business.Tin.     The approval of the  restriction scheme by the British Government was well received,  though it had been largely discounted in advance by the market.      On the side of consumption,  there does not appear much prospect of correcting the over-stocked position, the general tone of our provincial reports being &quot;about 50% normal&quot;.LjsaxU      Liverpool reports extremely quiet conditions.     The turnover of chemical works who sell to artificial silk manufacturers, &apos;buyers, etc., has fallen to nothing more than a few isolated tons.      Pipe and sheet trades in Birmingham about 20% below normal.Spelter^     Galvanising shows no signs of revival yet and the February exports of galvanised sheets from Swansea seem likely to be the smallest on record.     All works not closed are on short time.     Birmingham reports in much the same tone.SIR WALTER RAINE sent the following report:-Uncertainty is still the prevailing factor in the Coal Trade.      It is perhaps unfair to criticise the effect of the Quota system when it has not been in force three months, and,  therefore, my observations are made with a view of seeing if more elasticity cannot be introduced, beoau.ee surely it was not intended that Miners in one District, should be laid idle in order that those in another district should be enabled to work.,As Yorkshire and the Midlands are now about through the Quota for the current quarter,  a lot of broken time is going to be experienced in that area,  whilst Durham and Northumberland are already benefiting from this fact, and enquiries which were meant for Yorkshire Coals,  are coming here.      The position is not bright.The competition of Westphalia and Poland continues with unabated severity.     Not taking into account the economic position, the plan which is being worked by Poland,  is,  from the point of view of obtaining the Export Trade, very excellent indeed, namely to charge the home consumer a very much higher price-      There is only one factor which may cause it to break down, and that is, owing to the undoubted continued slackening in Trade,  the home consumption in Poland is becoming less,  so
that the effect will he before long, if it has not already arrived, that the Mines,  as a whole, will he working at a loss, or alternatively, the price to the home consumer will require to &quot;be further advanced, which may force the Manufacturers to raise their prices, thus preventing them from obtaining orders. Meantime, whatever is happening, Durham and Northumberland,  as well as the other Coal-fields,  are undoubtedly suffering through this unfair competition.Shipbuilding,     Orders are non-existent.     After this week, there will only be two Berths occupied on the whole of the Tyne, and four on the Wear, but of the latter,  two are being used for the construction of two Trawlers for foreign account.Shiprepairlng.     The very latest information in my possession is, that this class of work is very scarce indeed.Commodity Prices,     From reports which have come to hand to me in connection with the Chambers of Commerce, there has been an improvement in Butter, Bacon, etc.     On the other hand, the statistics for landings of v/hite fish for the months of January,  show an increase of 1926 tons, the quantity landed being 59,581 tons,  and yet the price realised was  210,446 less than twelve months ago.MR. ROWLAND handed in the following additional Notes on the Engineering Trade Position for January - February, 1931.;-Relation of Machinery Imports to Exports.      On many occasions previously we have pointed out that the volume of machinery imported into this country,  in relation to exports, is sufficiently high to warrant grave consideration.     The situation was already serious even in pre-war days, when the proportion of retained imports to exports was roughly 12 per cent, in tonnage and 18 per cent, in value;   but since the war, and particularly in the recent pronounced trade slump,  the proportions have increased to 21 per cent, and 35 per cent, respectively.The full details of the related statistics of exports and retained imports of machinery during the last two completed years are summarised in the table (appended), giving totals of tonnage and of declared value,  and the average values per ton.     We have purposely taken retained imports (calculated by deducting re-exports from gross imports) as the offset to exports, so as to ensure that the gravity of the problem is not overstated. The more serious aspect   of the situation, evident from the figures, is that the average value per ton of imported machinery has always been very much higher than that of expo rt s.It is fairly certain that some considerable proportion of the machinery products now imported could in reasonable conditions be manufactured by our own industry, and it has been roughly calculated, assuming a conservative quota of 75 per cent, to be produced here, and taking a reasonable wages factor,  that additional employment could be found in the engineering industry for fully 20,000 men each year, or, allowing for the wider employment which would be effected in auxiliary and cognate industries, the number would be somewhat in excess of 50,000 workers per annum.cj
Marine Engine Construction.A tablo*- which is abstracted from the latest Issue of Lloyd8 s Shipbuilding Returns, shows the position with regard to marine engine construction at home and abroad as at the end of last year.      It will be seen that approximately 568,000 h,p,  of marine steam engines were then building in Great Britain and Ireland, comprising 164,740 hr.p, of reciprocating engines, and 402,975 h,pn  of turbine engines, representing 42.,3 per cent,  cf all marine steam engines under construction in the world,     As regards oil engines, Britain accounted for 229,400 hap0, or 21,8% of the world total hnp,  then building.     The aboyo statistics compare rather unfavourably with the situation at the end of 1929, when construction in this country represented 369,700 h.p,  of reciprocating engines, 278,360 tup. of turbines (giving a total of 640,100 h.p. for ail steam engines) and 463,000 h.p. of cil engines.      These totals of steam and oil engines represented respectively 61.8% and 30.0% of the world aggregates.     Needless to say, this decline in the output of   -marine engines in the United Kingdom during the year 1930 was only a consequence of the general slump in shipbuilding, which was unhappily reflected in a progressive increase during the year of the unemployment index among shipyard workers from 23.3$ to 45.1$, and in marine engineering workers particularly from to 32.3$.Engineering Contracts.Appended will be found tho usual list giving particulars cf the mere important contracts recently placed with British firms.     The value of the order secured is also given where it is stated.* Not circulated.

*) fr o(J       o*UGANDA.A report has been received that the Colony is feeling intensely the competition of Japanese traders.    The prices of Japanese goods are said to be so low that others find it difficult,  if not impossible,  to compete.    Stocks are reported to be moving  but mainly of Japanese goods. Piece goods designs are skilfully Imitated by the    Japanese, and. the goods sold at a lower price than the cloth of the original design.    The trade is mainly for cash.      Goods are collected at hombasa by Japanese importers who distribute to wholesalers for cash, the latter taking the risk of credit with retailers in the bazaars.It is reported that 4 European firms, 2 English and 2 German, Intend to close down in Kampala shortly, and that one of the English firms,  established many years In the Uganda, importing and cotton ginning business, is asking for offers for its Kampala offices and godowns etc.It is understood that,in connection with the Japanese trade advance in the Colony, a Japanese Consul may shortly be posted to llombasa.In this connection attention is invited to the report from Tanganyika Territory to which reference was made last month./In the interests of economy the trade returns relating to Kenya, and Uganda,, Nigeria, Tanganyika Territory, Gold Coast.

9 p.; rrU o* tJMR0 WALKER handed in the following statement;-Nottln.gh.ami_     A more optimistic tone is evident and a -slight&quot;&quot;improvement in trade is reported.     The prices of raw materials are inclined to he firmer, and this should do much to induce buyers to place their commitments a little while ahead.The full fashioned Silk Hose section continues to be the brightest, whilst the business in Cashmere Hose now shews the seasonal tendency to diminish.     This latter branch has, however, continued in better demand than for some years past.As regards the Artificial Silk Section,  this is ejrporiericiiig severe competition from abroad, and the Half Hose section is rather more lively in tone.Children&apos;&apos;c Socks and f Hose, compared with other sections, are reasonably good.In the Underwear section, the amount of business*is not up to the normal standard for the time of year.&apos;    The weather conditions are probably affecting this section.Business is good on Bathing Costumesj    and there is a bxviek demand for fancy goods.As regards the Export trade, business is still sub-normal.Leicester;^     Trade in ladiesf fancy outerwear shews some improvement as regards quantity, but values are so low after the fall in the price of wool that it is difficult to maintain turnover without, a large increase in output.-, which is very difficult to obtain under the present depressed conditions.In other sections of the trade, business is below the usual level for the time of year.     Prospects for the immediate future are uncertain.Hinckley.     Conditions in this district remain very poor, and no &quot;improvement can be reported since the lact month? s statement was given^.M?hsfJjsldU      There is very little change in conditions   -in this district.The fine gauge fashioned Pure Silk section is still fairly active, and the higher grade fashioned fancy goods section is considerably busier, principally for American export.All other branches of Hose and Half Hose, (which are the principal goods manufactured in this district) ace very depressed,  and apparently will remain so,  as long as the imports of cheap foreign goods continue.^ ^P^l^oBE3?./.     Conditions here are very bad, worse than a year ago, and even worse than last month.      Short time is being worked in all departments,
Hawickv     Trade during the past month as compared with the corresponding month of last year is distinctly had, hut as compared with the past three or four months, there is if anything a slight improvement, and more machinery is employed,     There is certainly less short time, hut the position   for the season of the year is far from satisfactory, and the prospects are not brightP      Improved weather should bring about an improvement in trade for the Spring.The falling off in the Export trade is the worst feature and signs of betterment are not visible.IRON ANT) POSITION IN IJ^BmBY^MR. W.ALMSLEY sent the following reports-The output of Pig Iron during February amounted to 318,000 tons, which at first sight compares unfavourably with the January figure, but this represents an average of 11,400 tons per day as against 10,900 tons per day in January. It may still be hopedtherefore, that the January total will represent the low water mark in the production of Pig Iron, Unfortunately there was a reduction of two in the ,number of Furnaces blowing during the month;    four having been blown out and only two restarted.,      The number of Blast Furnaces now in operation is eighty-one,  or exactly half the number blowing at this time last year.      The reduced volume of production in the Cleveland district should prevent any important addition to the already heavy stocks., but so far there is no evidence of an increased demand which would be likely to absorb those stocks.The Steel figures for January were affected by holidays in Scotland and on the North East Coast,  and consequently the output of 402,000 Ingot tons for that month is not a representative figure for comparison with other months,      In February the Ingot output rose to 47V,000 tons, which is only about 60% of the production in the corresponding-month of 1930.The foreign trade figures are not yet available, but reports from Middlesbrough state that the total Pig Iron shipments from the Tees, including coastwise,  fell from 14,222 tons in January to 11,380 tons in February;    the difference being mainly due to contraction in shipments to foreign countries.      exports of manufactured Iron and Steel appear to have declined slightly during the month, but the import figures are not yet to hand..Reports from all districts indicate that the tonnage remaining on the order books is still declining, and there is no   real improvement in the outlook.      Ship-building, both in Scotland and on the North. East Coast, is still very depressed, with the result that Flate Mills can only operate for two or three days in each week.      There is slightly more business passing in Steel Rails and in Sections for constructional work, but this consists chiefly of small quantities for prompt delivery and the Steel Works are running practically from hand to mouth..
The position in Scotland may be appreciated from the statement that a request being made to the Head of the largest Steel Works there for permission to send a party cf students to visit the Works, the reply was to the effect that the Li 11s were operating so intermittently that the visit must take place on a Wednesday or a Thursday if the students wished tc see the plant in operation.      In many cases Mills arc running two shifts instead of the usual three, and unless there is some improvement in demand in the immediate future, there is a likelihood that an even shorter working week will have to be adopted.In spite of a general feeling in certain quarters that we have seen the worst, there Is no indication at present of any improvement in tho Iron and Steel Trade.      Consumers of Steel in all directions report increasing difficulty in obtaining work, and prices have been cut down to such a level that orders which can be secured are barely remunerative.The export position remains dull with a very slow demand from all markets,     A steady trade on moderate lines is still being done with Canada, and it is hoped that the visits to the Dominion which are now being undertaken by Trade Representatives will result in an improved turnover during the coming season,South Wales is unable to report any sign of improvement, and the  output from that district is less than 50fo of the capacity of the Works.      Many of the Steel Furnaces remain idle and the Rolling Mills are being supplied by imported semi-manufactured material.The Continental markets for export trade have been weak during the month and prices of all  classes of Steel material have fallen and established new low level records,      Basic Bessemer quality Continental Steel Joists to standard Sections can now be bought at about  4,0,0 per ton delivered to consumers near the seaboard in this country.
