IgCUMKNT IS THE PR0P5RTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOV^RNMMNT-95(31). COPY NO.     D_CABINET.EXPORT CREDITS COMMITTEE . jnterim Report by the Chairman.1. In accordance with decisions of the Committee conversations have taken place between the Lord Privy Seal and Mr. Bron, Head of the Trade Delegation of the U.S.S0R. on the subject of an extension uf trade between this country and Russia.     Mr,. Bron has also communicated his views on certain matters to the Lord Privy Seal in v/riting.     The issue of these conversations has not hitherto &quot;been satisfactory as it has not been possible to obtain from Mr. Bron with any finality a statement of the credit terms upon which Russia would be prepared to expand the volume of her purchases in this country. Meanwhile it may he noted that the volume of Russian business actually passing is being well maintained and during April and May more guarantees were offered by the Export Credits Department for Russian business than in any previous period of three months since the machinery of the Department was made available for such business with the single exception of the quarter ended 30th September,  1930.2. The difficulties raised by the Russians relate in the main to two categories of goodsA, Heavy engineering material;B. Ships.The issues involved in the application of credit facilities to purchases of goods in these categories require to be dealt with as separate problems,3 * Heavy Engineering Material.At present the Advisory Committee are prepared to guarantee on orders for goods in this category credits extending to two
years from the date of the placing of the order,  and a substantial volume of business has been done on this basis, Mr. Bron first asked that on orders for goods in this category &apos;G-erman terms&apos; of credit might be granted.     He subsequently asked (15th April) for 24 months&apos; credit from the date of delivery &apos;fcr the full amount of the orders&apos; and stated that on this basis he could start immediately to place orders to the volume of  5 millions with the prospect of increasing this amount during the current year to  10 millions.      It should be noted that the business now passing through the Export Credits Guarantee Department is at the rate of  k. million per month (See Appendix I).     At about this date an agreement was concluded between the Soviet and a German industrial group under which credits up to 33 months from the date of delivery-are to be accorded for heavy, engineering material.     The German Government are not formally a party to this agreement and we understand that they propose to consider each application for a guarantee on its merits.     The information at present available suggests that there have been considerable difficulties in placing orders under the agreement,     On the 14th May, after an agreement had been concluded between the Soviet and the Italian Government offering still more favourable terms of credit than even Germany had offered (for relatively small total sums, however), mm Bron again changed his ground and asked for Italian terms.4. It is clear, and this is the view of the Chairman of the Exports Credits Advisory Committee with whom we have been in consultation, that Mr. Bron, acting of course in the interests of his employers, is seeking to improve credit facilities for Russia by playing off one country against another.      In this country in addition, he is seeking to take advantage of the political situation arising out of the serious unemployment by developing propaganda in many directions to induce the
Government to bring pressure to bear on the Export Credits Advisory Committee to relax their terms for Russian business.5, It seems to us that the time has come when an effort must be made to achieve some sort of finality in regard to the credit facilities available for Russian orders for heavy engineering material,     The course which commends itself to us is that in agreement with the Advisory Committee, more elasticity should be introduced into the terms for heavy engineering material so that credits extending to 30 months from the date of the order could be guaranteed and in return we should seek to secure as firm an undertaking a s possible from Hri Bron that he will cease from his propaganda campaign for an extension of the credit period.     Y/e should seek to secure the support of the T.U.C. General Council and of the Party for this line of action so as to close our ranks as far as possible in the future against the propaganda campaign which will probably continue in one form or another whatever action we may take.6. As regards the adjustment of our credit terms, we have approached the Chairman of the Advisory Committee.     He has indicated that the Committee, while not altogether opposed to the grant of longer credit for definite orders, suspect that Russia may be trying to manoeuvre them into the offer of longer credit without increasing her orders in this country.     But he has grounds for believing that the Committee will agree to the extension now contemplated for heavy engineering if they can be satisfied that they will not be asked to make further concessions.     He is now sounding various members of the Committee on this basis.     \7e propose that if the Advisory Committee agrees with its Chairman,  the next step should be for the Lord Privy Seal to intimate the fact to Mr. Bron that
the llxport Credits Committee is prepared to examine sympathetically any proposals for credits upon heavy engineering orders submitted on the basis of not more than 30 months&apos;  credit from date of order,   and that an effort be made to induce Mr. Bron to accept these terms as final, after which we would propose to give the Chairman the assurance he seeks.7. At the same time we think,   and this is the view- of leading bankers in the City with whom the Chairman of the Advisory Committee has been in touch,  that it is highly paradoxical that at a time when the world and this country in particular has to come to the financial rescue of Germany, that country should be granting such credit terms to Russia as it is alleged to be doing,      V/e think that diplomatic conversations should be opened with the German Government in an endeavour to secure a gentleman 1 s agreement that Germany will bring her terms roughly into line with those now-suggested here, or at any rate that she will not Increase her present terms without consulting us.B. SHIPS,8. Mr. Bron has made requests for varying terms of credit for shipbuilding orders for periods up to about five years.     Strong pressure has also been brought to bear upon the Government by the Shipbuilding Trade Unions to extend the Sxport Credits Scheme to shipbuilding on the ground that business will otherwise &quot;go to Germany and Italy.,     So far as our enquiries show the building of ocean going ships for Russia in Germany and Italy with Government guaranteed credits has been on a negligible scale.      (In Italy for instance 3 small merchant ships of about 2,000 tons each appear to have been built or to be under construction).      In view,  among other factors, of the reiterated and growing opposition of shipowners not only in this country but internationally to
the construction of new tonnage for Russia by means of Government guaranteed credits, it seems unlikely that the Russians will be successful in sucuring facilities for the construction of ships elsewhere on any appreciable scale.(We tnink that this point might be kept in mind in any negotiations which are entered into with Germany).      So far as this country is concerned we have come to the conclusion that no attempt should be made to extend the scheme of export credits to the construction of new ocean going tonnage. Millions of tens of shipping all over the world are lying idle or are very much under employed, - tho latest figures of laid--up . tonnage In this and other countries are attached (Appendix II),     Whatever this country does in the direction Of granting credits for shipbuilding will set an example which other countries will certainly follow and there will be a new State-subsidised and artificial inflation of a market already glutted.      It is quite possible that If the principle of granting credits is concedad   by this country other countries would orrer better terms and the result might be that we had opened the doors to further ship-building without ourselves getting orderso      Further., there is a large supply of tonnage available now for chartering at reasonable rates,      Such chartering gives employment to British ships and seamen. When the new ships are available this employment will cease and ships manned by Russian crews employed on terms less favourable than those of crews of British owned vessels will enter Into competition with British ships - a competition which, as past experience shows, will lead to the cutting of charter rates and further unemployment of British ships and aeamen.9, Ac regards the purchase of existing ships, it has been understood until recently that the Russians were not
prepared to acquire second-hand tonnage.     Within the last few weeks, however,, they have changed their attitude and they are now making enquiries as to the possibility of acquiring certain specialc ategories of ships built subsequent to 1925 In this country.     They have apparently found a number of ships which would suit their requirements and which they would be prepared to purchase,      They are asking for very extensive    credit,10o    The objections of principle, which seem to us to be conclusive, to the use of the Export Credits Scheme to finance the building of new ships, might not appear at first sight to apply with, the same force to the U3e of the Scheme to facilitate the purchase of idle shipping by Russia.      There is however objection from the point of view of our Seamen Es Union who have made representations to the Board of Trade against the proposal and whose journal f or 6th May makes strong allegations about the difference between the condition of employment of British and Russian seafarers.     Again, the declared opposition of shipowners In this, country and abroad to the use of Government credit to finance new shipbuilding has in the last few days been extended to the use of Government credit facilities for the  sale of ships to Russia. Resolutions condemning the use of credit in such circumstances have been passed by the International Shipping Conference and by the Baltic and International Maritime Conference on which all the important shipowning countries of the world are represented.      (These resolutions do not, of course; take exception to the sale of redundant tonnage to Russia so long as no State-guaranteed credits are involved).Hi On examination it is clear that the arguments against the use of the Export Credits Scheme to shipbuilding apply with great force to the use of the  scheme for the  transfer of-G-
ft K -1ij \Jexisting tonnage.      In particular the risk to the employment of British tonnage and British    seamen now provided by Russian chartering would be made more imminent and would not be offset by the employment which would be provided by the c onstruction of ships in this country-      Our view therefore is that for the time being at any rate we should definitely decline to recommend to the Advisory Committee any extension of the scheme to the disposal of existing tonnage.12, The Lord Privy Seal has had informal conversations with Mr. Citrine (T.U.C. ) and ivirc ivuddleton (Labour Party) who are in agreement with our attitude both on Heavy Engineering and on Ships, and we recommend that a statement should be made in the sense of this memorandum to a Labour Party meeting with a view to allaying the feeling aroused by the continued Russian propaganda.(Intdo ) J.R.C.Home Office,26th June, 1931.
