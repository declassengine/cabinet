THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.CENTRAL EUROPE.CONFIDENTIAL.April 1, 1931.Section 1.[C 2170/673/3] No. 1.Law Officers of the Crown to Foreign Office. (Received April 1.)Sir, Royal Courts of Justice, March 31, 1931.I &quot;WAS honoured with your commands signified to me in Foreign Office letter of the 27th instant, requesting an opinion as to whether the conclusion of a treaty between Germany and Austria establishing a customs union would be contrary to the treaty obligations of Austria under article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain or under the Protocol No. 1 signed at Geneva on the 4th October, 1922.I have taken the matter into my consideration, and, in obedience to your commands, have the honour to report that : 1. Article 1 of the 3rd Protocol of the 4th October, 1922, indicates that Austria&apos;s undertaking in the 1st Protocol is a political declaration. Moreover, the 3rd Protocol contains specific provisions (e.g., in article 5) for protecting the security of the creditors and the guarantor Powers. I think that the economic provisions of the 1st Protocol have a political object which may be distinct from the protection of the security, and that those provisions should not be read as limited to what is necessary for the protection of the security.2. The independence of Austria referred to in article 88 of the Peace Treaty and in the first paragraph of Austria&apos;s undertaking in the 1st Protocol appears to be political independence.But in the second paragraph the economic independence of Austria is mentioned, and &apos;&apos; cette independence &apos;&apos; in the last line (line 2 of p. 6) according to the natural construction of the sentence, relates to this economic independence and not to the political independence previously mentioned.3. The immediate question is whether Austria has by the recently concluded agreement impaired or prejudiced (&quot; porte atteinte a&quot;) her economic independence by granting to Germany a special regime or exclusive advantages calculated to threaten the economic independence of Austria. A question which may arise in the future and cannot conveniently be entirely separated from the immediate question, is whether Austria is likely in pursuance of the agreement to make a treaty which will have that effect. There may be a doubt whether at the present stage there has been any &quot; octroi d&apos;un regime special ou cfavantages exclusifs.&quot; But it is to be observed that the treaty is to be made first between Austria and Germany, and subsequently there may be negotiations for a similar treaty with any other country that desires such a treaty. Thus Germany has already a priority which gives her a privileged position, and might, perhaps, be said to give her exclusive advantages. It seems to me fairly clear that if the treaty were made, there would then be a special regime and exclusive advantages in favour of Germany, unless and until they were generalised by the accession of other countries.4. The most difficult question is whether the special regime and exclusive advantages conferred upon Germany by this agreement, or likely to be conferred upon her by the proposed treaty, are calculated to threaten the economic independence of Austria. That is partly a question for economists, but also may depend partly upon legal considerations and I -will give my opinion upon it as requested.5. This agreement carefully preserves the political sovereignty of Austria in all respects (articles 1 (1), 5 (1), 6 (1). 9 (1) (3), 11 (3), 12 (2)). If economic independence means no more than political sovereignty in regard to economic policy, I think it is and will be unimpaired by the agreement or proposed treatv. But since the protocol contemplates that economic independence may be impaired by granting to another State a special regime or exclusive advantages (which would not naturally involve airy diminution of sovereignty), I think the phrase &quot;economic independence &quot; must have a wider meaning.[86 a-1]
6. I think the phrase &quot; economic independence &quot; cannot be paraphrased adequately as meaning either &quot;non-subordination&quot; or &quot;separation&quot;: those words would be more appropriate as explanatory of political independence. It is difficult to conceive an economically subordinate country, unless it were actually tributary : and it is difficult to find much meaning in the phrase &apos;&apos; economically separate countries.&quot;I think a better paraphrase would be &quot; effective liberty of action in economic policy.&quot;I think economic independence in that sense implies a power to bind oneself by agreements, and the making of such agreements is an exercise of economic freedom; Austria&apos;s economic independence would not be impaired by making ordinary commercial or tariff treaties.But I think it not improbable that the proposed treaty between Austria and Germany might have the eventual effect of rendering Austria economically dependent upon Germany in the sense that, while Austria would remain legally free to take such action as she chose in the economic sphere, it would, for commercial and other practical reasons, become impossible for her to act otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of Germany or to sever the partnership without disastrous consequences to herself. Much would depend upon the part which customs play in the national economy and internal administration and commercial life of of Austria. The immediate effect of the treaty would be to constitute an Austro-German free trade area enclosed by a tariff wall. That position would probably continue for three years or more, and it might well be that no similar treaty would be concluded with any other country. In the meantime, Austria&apos;s external markets would be increasingly found in Germany, and her external supplies would be increasingly obtained from Germany, since the tariff arrangement would tend to deflect Austria&apos;s trade with other countries into Germany. Eventually, Austria might become part of the economic system of Germany as fully as Florida is part of the economic system of the United States of America, or Wales is part of the economic system of Great Britain . and might find herself in a position in which she could not sever the partnership without dislocating her industrial and commercial organisation.7. These are conceivable consequences of the proposed treaty Whether such consequences are or not likely to ensue is not a question upon which a lawyer as such can express an opinion.A lawyer can merely express his view as to the meaning of the term &quot; economic independence.&quot;It is for economists to determine what consequences would in all probability follow from the proposed treaty, and whether the economic independence of Austria, in the sense in which I have explained this phrase,- would be threatened.Upon the hypothesis that the economists would answer this question in the affirmative, I express my opinion that the proposed treaty probably wrould be a breach by Austria of her undertaking in the 1st Protocol of 1922.8. The attitude of the Powers to the proposed customs union between France and Belgium after the Treaty of London of 1839, appears to afford general support to my view as expressed above, but the question is narrower in this case, because the protocol expressly allows to Austria freedom in the matter of customs tariffs and commercial or financial agreements, subject only to the proviso.I have, &amp;c.WILLIAM A. JOWITT.
