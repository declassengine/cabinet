TEjyjjGRAM FROM THL GOVERNOR OF HEW SOUTH WALES T0 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.Dated 20th March,  lgaj..(Received 1,55 p,m,  SOth March,  1951,)FOLLOWING my cable of the 10th December Plast referring t Bills passed by New South Wales Parliament with a view to abolition of the Legislative Council; the following is sent at the request of the Premier:-Begins:&apos; 1.      The Constitution (Legislative Council) Amendment Act,  1929, provided that the Parliament   of Hew South Wales should not pass into law any measure affecting the constitution of the Legislative Council until a special referendum was taken on each alteration and the approval of the electors was obtained at that referendum, and the same Act purported also to provide that it should not be repealed or its terms altered except in certain immaterial respects without a like referendum and without a like approval of the electors,2.      The New South Wales Parliament has passed two Bills that have already been cabled to you, first,  a Bill for the repeal of the above Act,  and,  secondly.,  a Bill to abolish the Legislative Council,50      The Supreme Court by four Judges, Justice Long limes dissentingj held that the above Act of 1929 was valid,  and restrained by injunction the President .of the Legislative Council and the Ministers of th3 Crown for New South Wales from presenting the two Bills above mentioned to the Governor for His Majesty&apos;s assent until approved by the electors at a referendum.,4,      His Majesty&apos;a Ministers appealed to the High Court of Australia and that Court by three Justices, two Justices, of whom one was the Chief Justice, dissenting;,  dismissed the appealo5,      His Majesty&apos;s Ministers are sending instructions to London to apply to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal from the decision of the High Court and have retained Sir John Simon.,j6 No.  D.o.  499(30),
BG36.    The questions which are raised depend upon the powers given to the New South Wales Parliament by the Imperial Statutes 1819 Victoria, Chapter 545 and particularly the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865.7.    The proviso to section 5    of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865 s requires laws to be passed in such manner and form as may be required by any Imperial Acts Letters Patent, Order in Council or Colonial Law for the time being in force,8o The substantial question which has been raised by the plaintiffs is that the proviso to :&apos;.:he said section 5 authorised and made valid the Constitution (Legislative Council) Amendment Act, 1929*9.    This means that it has been held to be merely manner and form that the Parliament of New South &quot;Wales cannot legislate on the subject of the Legislative Council^ either directly or even indirectljr? hy first repealing the prohibition uiless and until  &quot;the hundreds of thousands of electors who constitute a majority of the electors first approve.10-.    The questions raised in this appeal are questions which go to the root of free Parliamentary Government and involve the power of one Parlmanent to bind itself and its successors irrevocably,, and they apply not only to New South Wales but to all parts of the Empire.11.    The fifth section of the Colonial Laws Validity Act3 18629 has been relied on against His Majestyrs Ministers here,, and the remarks of the Privy Council in Taylor against Attorney--General of Queensland, reported in 1918 Queensland State Reports 194, show that that section affects all Dominions and Crown Colonies., and Viscount Haldane said that if the question were merely an abstract one they should probably direct the Attorney-General of England to attend5 in addition to representation of other parts of the Empire-      Viscount Haldane also said that the question should be raised in such form that its magnitude may be duly safeguarded by enabling representation before the Privy Council and in a Canadian case they directed the Law Officers to attend-12.    His Majesty&apos;s Ministers  and their l^gal advisers consider that    tho   majority decisions against them are wrong, and His Majesty&apos;s Ministers hold a strong view of their duty to uphold the freedom of Parliamentary action3 and the matter at issue is most important and urgent.1-3.    His Majesty&apos;s Ministers strongly urge the Imperial Government to be represented before the Privy Council and support their petition for special leave to appeal and also their appeal if special leave is granted.14.    A copy of the record in the High Court and of the judgments of the members of the High Court and further particulars will be posted at once. Ends.
Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governor of New South Wales.(Sent 9.30 p.mi  26th March,  1931)Your telegram of 20th March,      Please inform your Premier that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have given careful consideration to the suggestion contained in his message.      His Majesty&apos;s Government  do not, however, think - that it would he proper for them to petition for leave to intervene in the proceedings before the Judicial Committee.      If the Judicial Committee invite His Majesty&apos;s Government to be represented they would, of course,   comply, but they are advised that in that event it would be con-trary to precedent and indeed constitutionally impossible to instruct the Attorney General as to the line which he should adopt.      The Attorney General would address to the Board such arguments as he considered proper having regard to his view of the law.
