This contention was,  in my view, without foundation and it will be seen that the members of the Committee,  including those nominated by Mr.Lloyd George himself, all agree as to the correctness of my view.     The broad effect of their report is that there is no great volume of fresh work immediately available from the regional town planning schemes (paragraph 12) and that if such work as can be found is to be put in hand, it is not a question of new authorities being needed to be set up for.f the purpose, but of further Exchequer financial assistance to the local authorities who&apos;have undertaken as much work as they think they can undertake, having regard to the many competing calls on the rate funds (paragraphs 5 and 12).There follow certain detailed observations on points covered by the Report by the several Ministries responsible.
e\ pi  Paragraph 6.   Middlesex Sewage Scheme.     The   tJ k&apos; &apos;3 Minister of Labour and I have pushed forward this scheme and indeed it is very doubtful whether it would have reached the present stage without our help.     The Bill has been passed by the Lords and is now before the Commons.     The County Council is pushing forward with the detailed work of preparation, which is very great in a scheme of this magnitude, and it is a condition of the grant which has, with Treasury approval, now been promised that work shall be started before the end of October.      The Ministry of Health are keeping in touch with the County Council and their consultant to make sure that no time is lost.     I propose to add a footnote to the Report on publication as to the present position of the scheme.Paragraph 7.     Land Drainage.   The Ministry of Agriculture inform^me as regards land drainage schemes that the new Catchment Boards who will be competent to carry out comprehensive schemes (including some works of coast defence), are being set up as rapidly as possible.       They number altogether 47, of whom 20 have been constituted and have held their first meeting.     A further 15 will have held their first meeting by the middle or end of May.   In the remaining 12 cases, some survey work on the outer perimeter of the districts has to be completed, but it should be possible for all the 47 Catchment Boards to be functioning by the end of the summer.There is however a great deal of administrative work to be effected, e.g. transfer of powers from existing Drainage Boards, estimates of rateable capacity and preparation of schemes, before these Boards will be in a position even to consider the carrying out of the comprehensive wrks which they are empowered to carry out, and, even then, much if not all will depend upon the amount of the Government grant,  for which application may be made
a r-i nunder section 55 of the Land Drainage Act, 1930.There is every indication that Catchment Boards generally are anxious to carry out schemes of work as soon as possible,  and it may be anticipated that several of the smaller schemes will be undertaken this year.    IT or the reasons given in the preceding paragraph it cannot be expected that much,,  if any, work will be put in hand on the larger schemes during 1931, which must be regarded mainly as a year of preparation for substantial schemes, the consideration of which in some cases is already well advahc ed.In the meantime,   the Ministry is continuing to approve under its existing unemployment relief programme land -drainage schemes,  chiefly of. a minor character, submitted by authorities other than Catchment Boards.THE SECRETARY OR STATE    FOR SCOTLAND ADDS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AS TO SCHEMES UNDER THE LAND DRAINAGE (SCOTLAND) ACT,  1930.THE KELVIN.Scheme to relieve over 2,000 acres affected by flooding prepared,  to be advertised very soon. Subject to legal points&apos;which have still to be settled the Kelvin scheme should pass the Treasury this month.    After that it must go through the usual procedure of a hearing according to the objections which are taken to it.    The time-table in connection with the scheme is then entirely out of the hands of the Department and depends solely upon the objections raised and the time taken to deal with them.    If no very serious objections are taken the scheme
*J PJ omight he in operation in August,  and is estimated to employ 70 men.THE ANNAN.Scheme under consideration for dealing with natural obstruction in river, which causes valuable pasture land for some way up the river to be flooded.    Area affected has been surveyed. This scheme is not so far forward as the Kelvin, but is being proceeded with now as rapidly as possible.    It is smaller in extent than the Kelvin and may possibly stand on its own legs financially, which would enable the Department to get it through the Treasury more rapidly.    It might, therefore, be hi operation in the Autumn.    It would employ 30 men.THE SPEY.Scheme prepared to deal with erosion of banks and changes of lower channel and mouth of this river, which threaten two villages.    Scheme modified and at present reduced to building of a wall to protect one village.   Negotiations have been going on with owners and occupiers of houses in the village. The present position is that the Department of Health are reporting upon the condition of the houses; and until the Department of Agricul-ture know their condition, and whether the local people will be willing to be assisted, they cannot do anything.    If it goes through it would employ only about 12 men.
THE NITH.Scheme under consideration for restoring breach in and strengthening rest of embankment which protects several farms. This scheme is at a more embroyonic stage than the Kelvin or the Annan, but the surveyors are occupied upon it now.    It is difficult and will require a great deal of detailed work,   so that the Department do not think there is any prospect of its being in operation this year.    It might empl oy 50 men . -Paragraph 8.    Garden Cities.I propose to set up the Committee of enquiry recommended at the end of this paragraph.    There is much misunderstanding and much more investigation is needed, especially as to the location of industry, which is the crucial problem in the case of the garden city properly so called.It may be added that one of the objects of the Town and Country Planning Bill now before Parliament is to facilitate the preparation of regional plans,  the advantage of which is referred to in paragraph 13 and elsewhere in the Report.Paragraph 10.    The Minister of Transport is in entire agreement with the conclusion reached by the Committee as to the desirability of encouraging the -reconstruction of weak and narrow bridges,  and misses no opportunity of impressing the importance of work of this character upon local authorities, in speeches,   circulars and correspondence.    The latest circular dated the 27th March, 1931,  dealing with the grants to be made
9 0 f&amp;4 j 0from the Road Fund during 1931-32 towards the improvement and new construction of roads and bridges,  devotes an entire section to the reconstruction or replacement of inadequate bridges,  and emphasises afresh&apos; the fact that applications can be entertained for grants up to 75 per cent, for works of this character.   Local authorities have also been informed on several    occasions that consulting engineers should,  if necessary, be engaged to prepare the requisite schemes,  and that their charges would be accepted as grant earning expenditure.As is stated in the Report,  the number of these bridges dealt with annually is about 550,  and during the year 1930-31 it is anticipated that a total of 600 will have been reached.    If this number falls short of the arbitrary figure of 1,000 recommended by the Royal Commission on Transport,   this is not due to any lack of energy on the part of the Department, but to the backwardness of local authorities in submitting applications on the terms offered.    The rate of progress cannot be substantially increased without departing entirely from the principle that the local authorities concerned should make some appreciable contribution towards the cost of the works.The passing of the Bridges Act,  1929,  although providing very useful machinery,  does not remove all causes of delay in starting bridge schemes,  for there are usually technical and administrative problems to be studied with the railway and canal companies before a feasible scheme can be evolved.   Further,  the consequential improvement of the approaches to an old bridge usually involves demolition and re-housing, which always have a retarding effect on the progres of a scheme.
9 p i tj O JLIn the hope of mitigating some of the difficulties resented &quot;by bridge schemes which affect structures owned by railway companies a meeting was convened on the 31st March at which the problem was studied by officers of the Ministry of Transport and representatives of the railway companies.    As a result it is hoped that certain standard clauses may be formulated,   the use of which will shorten the negotiations when individual agreements are being discussed between railway companies and local authorities.At the last meeting of the Panel of Ministers on Unemployment the Minister of Transport undertook,  at the request of the Prime Minister,  to circulate a memorandum on the reconstruction or replacement of weak or narrow bridges at present in private ownership.    As the matter will be before the Cabinet in connexion with the present memorandum the Minister proposes to circulate his further report on weak bridges direct to the Cabinet.General.    A copy of the Report was sent on its receipt to the Liberal Party.    After consultation with the Lord Privy Seal and with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Transport I propose to publish it,  adding a footnote as to the position of the Middlesex Scheme (paragraph 6).    No further special action appears to be required at the moment -- arrangements have been made by the Lord Privy Seal for conferences between my officials and certain experts nominated by Mr. Lloyd George as to  some schemes of work brought forward by him as deserving of further enquiry.April,   7 th 1931 .(Intld.)

INTERIM REPORT.To The Right Hon. Arthur Gr Minister of Health,e en wood, M.P- ,Sir,1.We were appointed in January East with the following terms ox reference&quot;To consider the Reports issued by Regional Planning Committees and to recommend -(a) what schemes of work can be put in handwith due regard to the return to the community from the expenditure incurred, the need of pressing forward with the work as expeditiously as possible and of avoiding the delay of other worku now being or shortly to be executed, and(b) what measures should be taken in order tosecure that the works shall be speedily carried out, with an estimate of the probable cost of the several schemes, the economic return and the amount of employment likely to be afforded by them.&quot;These terms of reference were subsequently explained in a letter from you to the Chairman, a copy of which is at-taohed.      This was followed by an intimation from yourself that you wished us to confine our attention to the Reports of Regional PIaxmirig. Committ&amp;es which had already been issued at the date of our appointment.    We attach afso a letter re-ceived by the Chairman from the Secretary of State for Scotland (Appendix A).2. We decided at our first meeting to delegate thepreliminary examination of the Reports to a Sub-Committee consisting of those of our Members who have technical knowledge of the sub j ect-mat t or of the Reports.      This Sub-Counini t tee h*.a ,from time to tine reported to the full
9 9 9ij UCommitteeon schemes of work proposed in the Reports which appeared to them to merit investigation from the point of view of our terms of reference.There have heen nine meetings of the Sub-Committee and five meetings of the full Committee,3. We think it important to define clearly what is thenature of the Reports which were the subject of our Investiga-tion (though we are not unmindful of the description of them given in your letter to the Chairman of the 16th January), for their nature has necessarily determined the scope of our enquiry and the preliminary observations which we submit in this Report.It should be recognised in the first place that these Reports, while Including many of the more important areas, cover only about one fifth of England and Wales and, further, that schemes under the Town Planning Acts are not generally applicable to existing built-up areas.    We should also note that man;&apos;- of the Reports are of an interim nature.The Regional Planning and Joint Committees, whose* 1Reports   have been submitted to us, are &apos; advisory bodies eachappointed by a number of local authorities in a region tomake recommendations to them as to the future development and planning of the region.    The Reports issued by these bodies are not Intended to be programmes of public works.    Indeed,they are not primarily concerned with the execution of works thoat all, nor with/immediate relief of unemployment, but are suggestions for the planning of a scheme of development for a long period ahead on the lines which would be most* A list of these Reports, with the dates, is attached (Appendix B) ./ Some of these Committees have since become statutory bodies with power to prepare operative town planning schemes.
eJ G &apos;i ad^santarsons to the community a.\ large.      In so far as they eea^ganspecific proposals for.,.the construction of works, these proposals have not as a rule yet been the subject of any detailed engineering examination and do not generally include any estimate of the ecst of the works or., of the economic return which they may be expected to yield, or any indication of the dato at which they could usefully be undertaken.    ITor is it within the scope of the Reports to suggest by whom the suggested developments should be carried out.      Soroo of them, e.g., the provision of certain classes of houses or industrial establishments, would normally be carried out by private enterprise, but many,  such as the construction of important roads and the provision of working-class houses, would fall within the ordinary duties of the local authorities.We should point out also that the Reports do not necessarily commit the constituent authorities whose representa-tives sit upon the Regional Committees.    .In some cases the proposals in the Reports have heen adopted by constituent authorities and embodied by them in statutory town planning schemes -    As an instance of the value of these Reports, it should be pointed out that a number of works proposed in the Reports have actually heen or are being carried out,  either in accordance with approved schemes or in advance of such schemes. It should be understood, however,  that the object of such schemes is not to ensure the immediate execution of any particular work or works, but to pontrol the lines on which the future development of the area takes place, whether in public or private hands.Wo desire, indeed, to make it clear that in in Heating the limitations of Regional Planning Committees and of their Reports we do not wish to depreciate their value.    It is of the highest importance that a survey of development problems should be based on a wider area than that of a single Local
Authority, and that the various Town Planning--..phonies in a geographical region should fit in consistently with one another.    Again, it is well that plans should have regard to  dates far beyond the immediate future.    Only in this way can a wise and consistent policy of development he laid down.4. It will be appreciated that, the Reports being ofthe character described, it is impossible for the Committee consistently with the terms of reference to recommend schemes of work with regard to many of which they have not had before them either engineering surveys or estimates which would enable them to advise as to the economic return or to the amount of employment likely to be afforded.      At the present stage of our task, we have completed a careful preliminary study of the Reports, and certain broad considerations have emerged which we think it proper to bring to your notice before proceeding further, and these are dealt with in the succeeding paragraphs of this Report.5 . V7e are satisfied that the principal factor whichgoverns any further developments on the lines indicated in our terms of reference is the question whether, and if so, to what extent, greater financial assistance is to be avail-able from the Exchequer in aid of local schemes.      We have been told by those who can speak with knowledge of local authorities,  and we see no reason to doubt their view, that local authorities are reluctant to add to their own present financial commitments in respect-of unemployment works. We have evidence, however, to show that in some cases authorities would be willing and ready to undertake further works,  and could do so if greater&apos; financial assistance from national sources were forthcoming.
9 p fttj U &quot;J6, A concrete ilJjustra^i-on of the relation &quot;betweenurJBmplcfyment works and national finance is to &quot;be found in a schenie for tire joint sewerage of a number of districts in 7est Middlesex.The full details of this  scheme are within the knowledge of the Government Departments concerned,, and we have  accordingly not thought it necessary to moke a detailed investigation of its engineering and other aspects,      On the facts before us5 we regard the scheme as one which is desirable in itself and one which may obviate further expenditure on existing works during the next ten or fifteen years0      It would be of considerable value from the point of view of providing employments but we understand that it would, not be carried out at the present time in the absence of substantial assistance from the Exchequer.      The Middlesex County Council promoted a Bill in the present session of Parliament enabling them to undertake the schemes but they stated that they would not be prepared to proceed with It unless what they regard as satisfactory financial assistance were forthcoming.     7/e under-stand that arrangements have now been made for the payment of Government grant in respect of this scheme and that the Bill is being proceeded with,,7.t Other schemes for the relief of unemployment which .appear to us worthy of consideration a.re those for the construction of works for the prevention of coast erosion and for land drainage.      &quot;le have had the benefit of the views of colleagues upon this problem as it affects Lancashire and South Yorkshire.      Y,&apos;e think that, there is a prime, facie case for pressing on with any works of this description which would ultimately yield a return in the increased value of the

In approaching this question we have had to distinguish between:-(a) dormitory townss the main purpose of which is to house the expanding population of a large city;(b) satellite towns which, though having their own industrys etc s are definitely related to a parent cityz(c) new independent towns such as may be required in fresh industrial or mining areas0Beconferees which is being developed by the LondonCounty-Council3 may be named as cn example of the firsttype j Telwyn of the second typo   \7ythenshawe 9 which is being developed by the Manchester Corporation^ stands between thefirst two types   Letchworth and the communities proposed inthe South &apos;7r.leas Bonenster and East Kent Reports may be citeas instances of the third type&quot; It will be recognisedthat the types merge into one&quot; anotheraSo far as the provision of dormitory towns isconcerned.j. the question as it effects local authorities at present ;sent is mainly one of the provision of working-classhouses with tho aid of the subsidies provided under theHousing Acts^ and local authorities are now occupied incarrying out the programmes which they were required to make

Indeed, one of our colleagues, who has great experience in these matters, informed us that he estimated the period which would be occupied with such prelininaries as negotiations with private land-owners and public authorities at from two to three years0      It is no doubt true that certain facilities may with advantage be provided, in advance of actual requirements, in order to encourage industrial and other development by private agencies0      On the whole, however, while we are attracted by the possibilities of future usefulness In these forms of development, we    regretfully have to accept the fact that no immediate employment c an be found on a large scale in these works,  end that any expenditure incurred upon them at this stage would he of a
9 0 Q0 G) udefinitely speculative character as regards the amount of revenue which would l^result from the work provided,, though we have reason to hope that the hulk of the outlay might ultimately become remunerativeo     &quot;.7e do not think;,  thens that we could rightly occupy ourselves in the detailed investigation of schemes of this kind without an extension of our present terms of reference to cover work which could not usefully be put in hand until a later date than would appear to be contemplated in our terms of referencec7,7e think that the question is deserving of further consideration,,      If the Government concur in this view, we suggest that the inquiry might be better carried out by mother specially constituted Committee, 9c As Regional Planning Reports are concerned primarily with future development? it is only natural that proposals regarding new or improved highways should figure prominently in the schemes,     7.re have examined a large nimiber of proposals and,, although in most cases there is an absence of detail on their financial and engineering aspects, we have had the advantage of receiving the opinions of the Ilinistry of Transport and of others concerning them.Broadly specking, of the highway proposals contained in the Reports before us, a considerable proportion of the more important, if not already completed,  are in hand or will be undertaken in the comparatively near future      Of the remainder, there  ere some which are held up for financial reasons, but there are many others which do not appear to have any european special claims for early construction on tile grounds of urgencyc
9 0, (\ U a uThe oxrtehi of the work already completed is explained hy the facts that the Reports considered hy us have heen published at various dates during the past ten years, and that during that period there has been great and continuous activity throughout the country in the improvement of existing highways and the construction cf new highway So     tluch of this represents work which has been put in hand at an earlier date than would normally have been the case, with the object of providing employment*      The same practice is still being followed and is embodied in two great programmes formulated by the Ministry of Transport and the various highway authorities, vize, The Trunk Road Programme and- the Rive Years&apos; programmer      The former represents a total expenditure of about  21 millions, while in the latter a total expenditure of about  27-g millions has been envisaged,.Prime, facie3 the improvement of highways might appear to offer very great scope for providing employment, but the limitations immediately become apparent when the degree of urgency and the&quot;&quot;&apos;financial considerations are correlated,,      Urgency may &quot;be jjkoged in the main by the need for relieving traffic on existing roa.ds or by the desirability of developing some particular locality&quot;    finance, we would point out,-mfis not confined solely to finding the capital required for the improvement or new construction - there is the
additional and recurring expenditure required for maija-9 01O Utenance after the works have been completed.Having regard to the amount of work which has heen done or which is in hand or which is included in current programmes, we doubt the possibility of finding additional employment on a large scale from this source.      From our preliminary investigation of the schemes, however, we have come to the conclusion that there are a considerable number of proposals - not necessarily all of magnitude - in various parts of the country which are not included in any programme, but which might -with profit be brought to the notice of the appropriate highway authorities by the Ministry of Transport, with a view to adding them to one or other of the existing programmes. But these, like the other schemes to which we have referred, seem to us to depend upon the general financial considerations alluded to in paragraph 5 above.10.      A number of the Regional Reports have referred to the desirability of constructing new and of replacing or improving weak or narrow bridges.      The large number of bridges involved, makes it impossible for us to Investigate the schemes in detail, but we feel that work of this character, apart from its traffic value, affords oppor-tunities for increasing the volume of employment.We understand that, during the last financial year, 550 weak or inadequate highway bridges were reconstructed or widened with the aid of grants from the Road Fund, and that during the current year the rate of progress is being maintained.      We may note that the Royal Commission on Transport recommended that work on these bridges should be accelerated and suggested that 1,000 bridges a year should be taken in hand.Many of the bridges concerned are privately owned,-10-
........ 9 0 9axLd^--although highway authairWJLas cm, in some cases.rely upon the provisions of the Brtdges Act, 1929, in others the authorities possess no statutory powers in thematter.      This means that most of the preliminary arrange--ments must he made &quot;by negotiations which, we gather,  are often of a protracted nature.Further, in districts where the lack of adequatelystring bridges is most acutely felt, additional diffi-culties arise.      These districts are largely built-built-up areas and the cost of acquiring the property necessaryfor the improvement of a-bridge and its approaches will,in many cases, account for-a high proportion of the totalcost.&quot;We have been informed that,  since July, 1929,  the Minister of Transport ha&quot;s been prepared in approved cases-&apos; to make grants from tile Road Fund up to 75% of the approved net cost falling upon highway authorities where the bridge concerned is privatedly owned.      We also understand that, during the current financial year,  schemes providing for the reconstruction or strengthening of privately owned   -weak bridges,-and estimated to cost over   1,000,000* have already been approved for commencement or in principle.Several Reports also recommend the construction of new bridges, notably those for South-West Lancashire, Berkshire, South Tees-side and South Tyneside.      Estimates of cost are not always available and the acquisition of property for bridge approaches etc., would necessarily take time and involve in some cases,   large -expenditure. These schemes open out possibilities which may be worthy. of further investigation. 11.      Many of the Reports contain suggestions for the pre-servation of open spaces and the provision of recreation-11-
groands.      While we regard such proposals as eminently desir-? 001 able, we have to note that the greater part of the expenditure would he incurred in the acquisition of land, and the amount of employment afforded in levelling and laying out these lands would he relatively small.Afforestation is also a subject which finds a place in some of the Reports.      We have c nsuited the Forestry Commission on this matter and we learn from them that trie planting of ten acres of forest employs one man for six months.    The work of maintenance thereafter occupies one man full time for a hundred acres.      It will be seen,  then,  that the amount of employment which such proposals could afford is slight.12.      The general conclusion at which we nave arrived is that, necessary and valuable as these Reports are for the purpose of guiding future development, there is no great volume of addition-al work to be found immediately available within the Regional schemes which have been submitted to us.      Indeed, as we have said above,  we have found large portions of these schemes already in hand or arranged to be taken in hand in the near future. There are, no doubt, many instances of works which could becarried out promptly if finance were available, but-these do not constitute any large proportion of the proposals.      There is a further volume    of work which could be brought forward for consideration at a later date,  subject to the necessary detailed surveys and estimates being prepared by the executive authorities concerned.      The authorities might be encouraged to embark upon this work by a promise of further financial assistance.      We do not find at present any case for the establishment of a new-form of organisation, national or local,, for the execution    of the work;; net already in hand  which these Reports disclose.    So new national organisation, because there are at the present time in existence a number of central bodies to which application may be made for assistance in respect of works suitable /
9 r aU     ^for hmiisblate execution and calculate&amp;^tO provide employment e. go sThe Unemployment Grants Committee;The Advisory Committee appointed under theDevelopment (Loan Guarantees and Grants^Act,1929; The Ministry of Transport;The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.No new local authority, because there is no-evidence that such works cannot be carried out by the existing local bodies,  and many of the proposals to which ?ur attention has been drawn are in fact already bein^ so carried out.      It is clear, moreover, that there would be considerable opposition on the part of Local Authorities to the creation of a new local authority with power to demand by precept upon them.13. We have indicated in paragraph 5 the fact thatthese Regional Planning schemes only cover about one-fifth of the area of England and Wales.      This of necessity-precludes a national survey of Regional Development.      We are of opinion that Regional Planning Committees should be encouraged throughout the country, and in this way it will then be possible, as is not now possible, to take a national survey of future development.14. While we recognise that the present Report does notexhaust the terms of our reference, we feel that, having maderthis survey, we ought to submit to you our prima facie conclu-sions based on our preddminary&quot; inquiries before proceeding with more detailed, and. lengthy investigations which might occupy a longer- period than you had    in your mind when you appointed us.Signed on behalf of the Committee -GHELIISFPRD-2Sth March,  1931.

The f oAi^vxr^facts and. -considerations vri&quot;&apos;.   ^pr^alxl^ be-of-service to you in considering the Regional Reports -1,    The object of town planning schemes is to controlfuture development along lines likely, to be most bene-ficial to the community.     Thus, they set out the lines of the principal roads, specify to what uses (industry, residences and the like)  the different areas shall be put and at what densities, allocate land for private and public open spaces, and include various provisions for securing amenitiss0It will be seen, therefore? that most of the development which will be carried out in a planned area will be by private enterprise.    The principal wer :s to be carried out by the Local Authorities will usually be road works, many of which will be subsidiary roads of little or no importance for through traffic      Housing schemes may, of course, also be carried out in accordance&apos; with the schemes.      These and other works are usually carried out under the general powers of the Local Authorities? what the scheme does is to regulate- the development, after a comprehensive consideration of all the local circumstances and needs,  setting down, for instance, the lines of the roads and what lands aro suitable and convenient for housing and at what densities.2.    It is of the essence of a planning scheme to lock well into ihe future.      It provides for develrjpmant which may not be required for very many years.      The ge.iorcl_in.ten-ticn is that the works which would fall to be done by the Local Authorities ehc.ll be done as and when ex-expedient and means afford.      I may add,  also, that the Ministry advise Local Authorities to review their schemes
periodically in the light of any char^ijr^-ciJrc-UDistances. The reports of the Advisory Committees are usually n?t intended as more than &quot;broad guidance or indications to the  several Local   Authorities of what central and ^ development seem desirable.      As a rule, proposals are not worked! out in detail.      For instance, the line ef a new arterial road may be indicated, but generally there will have been no detailed survey of the line of the road,  there may not have been detailed negotiations with the Local Authorities through whose areas it passes and no negotiations with the owners of land.      It will pro-bably be found that many of the suggestions reqivire a go^d deal of more detailed investigation before they can be endorsed as practicable ^r desirable./What the Government are looking for are schemes nf public advantage which can be put in hand at an early date.        You will, I feel sure, appreciate that it would be a waste of time for the Committee to put forward proposals on which they have not sufficient evidence that the.:/ are practicable ,  are based on a firm foundation of fact ascertained after due Investigation, and wall be of definite public advantage if carried cut now.A number of proposals contained In regional reports have already been or are being carried out.      Someproposals have been embodied in Preliminary Statements(which are a f^rm of preliminary planning schemes)or in approved schemes.        Other proposals have keencarried out under the ordinary powers of Local Authorities(as for road works)  in advance of completed schemes.(ill)
*) p. oThe Government will provide- the Committee,with    - 0d0 tochnioal-a-asessors.      It will he important   .for the Committee that the technical assessor shall he an expert on the particular hind of work which is being considered, whether, for instance, road work, a water scheme, garden city e*r satellite town development, some agricultural development, and so on,     &quot;That may prove most helpful to the Committee is to adopt one or other of the following courses-, according- to the cixtsumstances of the case -(a) In some cases it may prove sufficient that the Ministry concerned should, at the request of the Committee, send to their meeting the appropriate officer or officers for considering a proposal or proposals.      It may be possible to settle a number of proposals in this way, and this may be found a useful preliminary in all proposals:(b) In appropriate cases,  it may be found expedient to aslc for a report from the appropriate Ministry, after-local investigation where need be, on proposals, in order to avoid waste of labour and in order to make the v/ork of the Committee as fruitful as possible.    I am anxious, as I am sure you will be,  that before asking for such an investigation and report,  the Committee will tiioroughly satisfy themselves that a sufficient case has been made out for the further investigation and report:(c) In some cases,  the Committee may find it advisable themselves to ascertain the considered views of the Local Authority or Local Authorities concerned,I need scarcely say that I shall be glad to furnishyou with any further information which you may desire, andthat my Ministry and the other Ministries concerned willgive your Committee tho help they can in its labours.Yours sincerely,(signed)    ARTHUR GREENWOOD, (iv)
q r iO o JCopy of letter from the Secretary of State for Scot lea A to &apos;&quot;tibe &apos; Cbaiiifean of the Committee.22nd January..  193 L.Dear Lord Chelmsford,I have so*m the let/ter addressed to you on the 16th instant hy Mr:0  GT-e^ivfoo-d, with which I-concur generally, hut as regards Scotland I should probably e:cplain that Regional planning lias made little headway as compassed w ith Englar^, There are only four Regional Schemes in the proper sense of that tern in the  course of preparation, and only&apos; in the case of two of thom nave report3 and plans.&quot;been prepared.     These two are known as tho Clyde Valley and the Fife County Regional Town Planning Schemes,   and in their case the reports and plans issued cover only road proposals, that is,  formation of certain new roads and widening of existing roads.        The other two Regional schemes are known as the Ayr County Regional Scheme and the Central Scotland Regional Scheme but in their case no practical steps have yet been taken in their preparation other than the setting up of a technical &quot;committee composed of local authority officials, for the purpose&apos;of framing road proposals in the  first instance.      It does not, however, seem necessary or advisable to interpret too strictly in the case of Scotland the term &quot;Regional&quot; and I think that among Regional Schemes might be included the Aberdeen and District Jo.Int Town Planning Scheme, which Includes land in the counties of Aberdeen and Kincardine and In the City of Aberdeen.      The preparation of this scheme has been completed and it has been formally adopted by the local authorities concerned.      It should be ready for submission to the Department for their approval at an early date.It&apos;should be noted that in all of these schemes burghs are included.Subject as above, the remainder of Mr.  Greenwood&apos;s letter is applicable to Scotland&apos; as to England,  and the - procedure-crutlined by hrm will be followed in Scotland..Yours faithfully,(Sgd)   Wil.  ADAMS Oil.he Rt. Hon. The Viscount Chelmsford,G-.C.S. I. ,  G. C.M.G. ,  G. C. I. E. ,  G. B. E. .
