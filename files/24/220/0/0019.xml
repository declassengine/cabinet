Sjitteb on the bsed imperial mic c0np3re-iceUTTAWAo1. With reference to 0.0. (30) 1st Conclusions;, Minute 4 (a), the Committee had before them the Interim Report of the Inter-Departmental Preparatory Committee on Quotas for commodities ether than Wheat, Import Boards, Bulx Purchase, and the Organisation of Channels of Trade (0.0.(30) 10).The questions for determination by Ministers were summarised in the concluding paragraph of the Report as follows  s-(a) whether In the case of butter they approve the proposal to give no further consideration to(1)  a Quota,(S) an Import Beard,(3) Outright Bulk Purchase, and(4)  a guaranteed fixed pricej(b) whether they desire that a more detailed examination should be made ef the plans for -(1) a special propaganda campaign In the United Kingdom for Empire butter at a cost of,  say,  50,000    to  60,000 per annum for three or five years $(2)  assistance in the organisation ofcentralised marketing of Empire butter without further necessary cost to the Exchequer3(c) whether they desire  that a more detailed examination should be made of the possibility of a price guarantee for Empire butter entailing a possible liability to the Exchequer not exceeding the difference between the proceeds of sale and a priee based en a defined relation to the Danish price; and(d) in the event of an affirmative decision on (b) and (c)  above, whether they are willing to authorise confidential cqn-sultation with a few selected represent-atives of trading interests and producers with a view to the working out of practic ab 1 e s c he me s.
9 i ohi JL 0In the course of discussion it was explainedIthat the proposal to spend  50;000 to  60,000 per annum for three on five years on a special propaganda campaign in. the United Kingdom for $spire butter would he supplemental to the work now being done by the Empire Marketing Board, and that it !   y/as anticipated that the result of the campaign would be a substantial increase in the demand ferBominic butter in those parts of the United. Kingdom where at present there is little demand for such butter.On the other hand., it was pointed out by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that acceptance of the proposal in the case of butter would lead to demands that special propaganda campaigns should be instituted in the case of other- Dominion commodities and to claims by the home producers of butter and ether commodities for equivalent benefit.    The cost of the Exchequer might well be very substantial and he was not in a position to say that the Chancellor of the &quot;-Exchequer would agree to any part of the cost of the proposal being met by the Treasury.It was, moreover, pointed out by the Parliamentary and Permanent Secretaries to the Ministry of Agriculture,  that for the Empire Marketing Board to undertake a propaganda campaign in favour of a Dominion commodity, such as butter,  which competed with a United Kingdom product, was an entirely new departure,  and was one which would ,give rise to acute political controversy and inevitably to a demand by the home producer for compensating advantages to home dairy products.      The policy proposed could not be reconciled with that on which the Agricultural Marketing Bill was based,  namely, the rejection of the idea of direct financial assistance from the State for the home producer,
71 MTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS expressed the view that no useful purpose would he served by going to Ottawa if every proposal involving cost to the Exchequer was rejected.      It was  &quot;she duty of the Committee to devise schemes which might be put forward at Ottawa as the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to an arrangement of mutual advantage to each part of the Empire,  and he felt  that schemes should not he rejected solely on financial grounds inthe absence of information as to what trade advantages might he offered by the Dominions to the United Kingdom at Ottawa.      Pie entirely agreed that the United Kingdom producer must be brought within the scheme.      The proposed further examination, in consultation with the trade,  of the butter scheme, would not commit the Government to approval of the scheme even in principle, and. it would be fully -understood that it would he open to Ministers to accept or reject the scheme after receiving a report on the results of the examination.-o-

091bJ hi Js.EL POST RATES       2. The Couaittee had under consideration taken THE UNITEDDOM AND CANADA.    Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (paper O.C.   (80)   13)  on parcel post rates between the United Kingdom and Canada.      After setting out the political and commercial arguments in favour of a reduction of the present parcel rates,  the Memorandum suggested that the United Kingdom representatives should be authorised to propose at the Ottawa Conference a trial for two years of certain revised rates,  on the understanding that at the end of that period the matter would he reviewed in the light of the resulting figures of volume of traffic and the loss to the two Exchequers.In the course of discussion THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY informed the Committee that the British Trade Commissioner in Canada had been consulted and had expressed the opinion that there was little demand in Canada for  the reduction and no evidence that,  if the change was made,  trade would be expanded.      Tho proposal.was estimated to cost the British Exchequer about  52,000 and the Canadian Exchequer about  20,000,  annually,  on the basis of the present traffic.      If this concession was &apos;made in the case of Canada it would, no doubt, have to &quot;be extended to the other Dominions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION A3-FAIRS pointed out that the demand for lower parcel post rates came mainly from traders in the United Kingdom, but was supported by the present Prime
Minister of Canada and other influential persons in that DominiohoTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION observed that the other Dominions had refused to entertain the proposal, which he explained was based on reciprocity,  on the ground that they could not afford the loss of revenue involved,The Committee, other than the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury, who a sked that his reservationshould be recorded, agreed to recommend the CabinetThat the United Kingdom representatives should be authorised to submit to the Ottawa Conference the proposal respecting the reduction of parcel post rates between the United Kingdom and Canada set out in the concluding paragraph of&apos; 0eC.

REPORT.At their first meeting the Cabinet Commictee on the proposed Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa decided (Conclusion 2C) to refer to the Inter-Departmental Committee the further examination of Quotas for commodities other than Wheat, Import Boards, Bulk Purchase,  and the Organisation of Channels of Trade. In comeliance with that decision the Inter-Departmental Committee have given preliminary consideration to these subjects and submit the following interim Report. Decisions required on -points of principle.Before considering in detail the machinery that would be necessary to give effect to any of these prooosals,  which would require consultation with representatives of producers and traders,, it has seemed best to set out the principles which appear to be involved in the various possibilities,  and to ask for a decision on these before proceeding further.    The points on ?vhich a decision is asked for are summarised in the last paragraph of this report. Choice of a Commodity.Inasmuch as the questions of policy requiring decision are likely to be similar in character in the case of most commodities, the Committee vere of opinion that the most convenient course would be to examine the points of principle arising in connection with a particular commodity rather than to attempt at this stage to cover the whole range of possible commodities.    The commodity selected should,   as far as uossible,  fulfil the following-conditions(a) There should be a substantial existing Empireproduction,   capable of large and rapid expansion in favourable economic circumstances, available for export to the United Kingdom.
(b) There should he a large United Kingdom consumption,only partially supplied hy imports from the Empire -i.e.  the United Kingdom market for imports from the Empire should he capable of considerable expansion.(c) The commodity concerned should not be a commodity ofinterest only to one part of the Empire.(d) It should be a commodity the production and distribution.of which are already fairly high centralised.(e) Other things being equal,  it should be a commodity, anincreased demand for which in the United Kingdom would be likely to create the most favourable conditions for migration from the United Kingdom to the parts of the Empire concerned. The commodity most nearly fulfilling all these conditions is butter.    Dairying is an important export industry in Australia, Few Zealand and the Irish Free State, and may become so in Canada,  South Africa and Rhodesia.    In all these areas the production of butter is capable of large and comparatively rapid expansion.    The value of the total imports of butter in 1929 was  54,700,000* of which  22,300,000 or about 40 per cent, was imported from the Dominions.    The imports fiom New Zealand were  11,280,000,  those from Australia  6,340,000,  those from the Irish Free State  4,580,000,  and those from the Union of South Africa  103,000.    The home supply was estimated to represent by value in 1929 nearly 14 per cent,  of the total imports.    Of the foreign imports,  amounting to approximately  32,500,000,  nearly two-thirds come from Denmark.From the Dominion standpoint,  the advantages of any scheme would depend on the extent to which it promised to be successful in securing a more favourable market and increased-The figure for 1930 was  4 6,900,000.
9 O Qdemand for Dominion buttor in the United Kingdom.    This would entail the reduction of the price margin between Dominion and Danish butter (which fetches the higher price) and the maintenance of that reduction in the face of a greater volume of imports of Dominion butter. Quotas for conmoditd.es ^other^han wheat.By a quota system the Committee understand the institution of a scheme of control which would result in given proportions of the United Kingdom consumption being reserved for supplies from Home and/or Dominion sources.    It would be inconsistent with our international Treaty obligations  (see Appendix I) to carry out such a system by controlling imports alone and we a-re of opinion that  (except in the case of a few commodities which go through a manufacturing process in this country,  of which wheat is an example) to exercise control internally in this country, if practicable at all, would seriously clog the distribution of the goods in question and need the establishment of a cumbrous machine, the expense of which would be out of proportion to any benefits which could accrue under such a system.For these reasons we recommend that no further consideration should be given to schemes for the institution of a quota in relation to Empire butter. i?l 2. ^ Boards .An Import Board, as usually understood,  involves a statutory monopoly.      A Board exercising such a monopoly would,  in view of -our treaty obligations,  if for no other reason, have to deal with home as well as overseas  (including foreign) supplies.    It would involve complicated and controversial legislation, the sotting up of special machinery, and the conversion of the private merchant, so far as he was retained, into an agent of the State.      In the course of the discussions by the Imperial conference committee on Economic Co-operation none of the Dominions favoured the establishment of Import Boards of this
type.    The general view was that such a system -rould be liable to lead to political friction between the United Kingdom and the Dominions in the allocation of the Board&apos;s purchases and on the question of price.      The apprehension ^as expressed that the monopoly powers of the Board would enable it to exact from the overseas producers lower prices than would be secured in the existing processes of trade.    Again, from the point of view of the United Kingdom, heavy financial losses might result, which it might be impracticable to pass on to the consumers.We, therefore, recommend that an Import Beard for butter should not be put forward for consideration at the Ottawa Conference,  and the same arguments would seem to apply to other commoclit ies. 8 * Qnt right Bui k^ Pure has e.The form of bulk purchase which implies the creation of a State controlled organisation to buy and sell on a large scale differs from an Import Board Scheme in not involving a statutory monopoly, and from a price guarantee scheme such as is discussed below in that the organisation would purchase outright and would therefore take any profits or bear any losses.    Outright bulk purchase would be subject to the save objections as import boards, viz. friction with the Dominions, difficulties of fixing prices, interference with existing trade channels and risk of heavy financial losses.    In addition the risk of loss would be all the greater in the absence of a monopoly.      The experience of the Federal Farm Board in the United States is a warning.      We therefore cannot recommend outright bulk purchase in this cense in relation to the commodity under consideration,  i,e. butter.9* 9XS.^E^.l?tt^on...5.?...t&apos;.Fa.d? channels.3y this term we understand    schemes designed to improve the marketing of Dominion products in the United Kingdom but not involving a financial liability to- the Exchequer in respect of
9 CM  &amp; JLpossible trading losses,  though there v/ould be some small administration charges if these were not covered by commissions. In the case of butter both Australian and New Zealand producers have statutory Dairy Produce Boards, which through their London agencies exercise a certain degree of supervision over sales by importers.      Any reorganisation of methods of sale of Australian and New Zealand butter along the lines of centralised marketing would encounter a certain amount of opposition among importers in this country, who would cease to buy on their own account from factories in the Dominions and become agents selling on commission.      Such opposition would probably be considerably diminished if the United Kingdom Government lent its aid in arranging satisfactory terms with importers.      An outline of a scheme for centralised marketing, in the organisation of which the United Kingdom Government through the Empire Marketing .Board might co-operate with any Dominion, whose import of butter into the United Kingdom was or came to be sufficiently centralised, during an initial period of,  say, three or five years, is given for the purpose of illustration in Appendix II.There is some reason to believe that the principle of centralised control of sales would commend itself at least to some of the Dominions concerned and would be a useful, though not altogether essential,  adjunct to the special propaganda campaign for increasing demand referred to in the next paragraph. It would also be an essential part of the machinery for any such scheme as is discussed in paragraph 13.      Much closer examination, however, in conjunction not only with the trade interests in this . country but with the representatives of the producers in the Dominions would be necessary before any such scheme could be put forward at Ottawa. 10* A Propaganda Camp campaign^In addition to the types of scheme specially referred to them,  the Committee have considered a proposal for a special
9 - 9Kif Vj l*Jpropaganda campaign designed to increase the demand for Empire butters.      Such a campaign would be the simplest and most direct way of achieving; at any  -rate in some measure, the object aimed at, its cost to the Exchequer can be accurately measured, and it can be operated either alone,  or as a part of any other method which it may be desired to adopt.The Empire Marketing Board have hitherto deliberately restricted their efforts, except to a limited extent, to a general &quot;background&quot; appeal in favour of Empire buying;    but if on grounds of policy it should be decided to launch a special campaign for Empire butter and sufficient funds were available fpr the purpose, there is little doubt that substantial results could be achieved.     An outline of such a scheme, prepared for the purpose of illustration by the staff of the Empire Marketing Board and estimated to cost from . 50,000 to  60,000 per annum for three years,  is annexed to this report (Appendix III).*It is noteworthy that the great bulk of the Dominion butter sold in this country is sold in the South and West of England, and there is a well-marked line across the Midlands to the North of which there is at present little demand for Australian and New Zealand butter.      The Empire Marketing Board, with the active co-operation and good-will of the trade, have&quot;already done a good deal of ground work with a view to advancing this &quot;butter front&quot; northwards,    It is believed that a sustained campaign,  such as is outlined in Appendix III, would have a considerable effect in increasing the demand for Dominion butter and thereby raising its relative price;    and that the results to be achieved would be fully commensurate with the estimated cost.*We are given to understand that the sum of  50,000 to  60,000 could not be found out of the present and prospective resources of the Empire Marketing Board having regard to their existing programme and policy,,
9 S 9w y11. Tho need for some form of^^uarantee^Of the types of scheme dealt with in the preceding paragraphs, the Committee have felt unable to recommend either (a) a compulsory quota,   (b) an Import Board exercising a statutory monopoly, or (c) outright Bulk Purchase.    They have recommended for further examination (d) the possibilities of the organisation of centralised marketing, and they have expressed the view that  (e) a special propaganda campaign would have a considerable effect in increasing the demand for Dominion butter and thereby raising its price.They feel, however,  grave doubt whether either (d) or (e) in itself constitutes an offer which is likely to carry much weight politically at Ottawa or is calculated to produce any valuable counter-offer from the Dominions.    The effect of measures such as a propaganda campaign or centralised marketing cannot be easily estimated, and, even though it is conceivable that they might in practice be more advantageous to the Dominions than a small tariff, it is certain that they would, in themselves, be definitely less acceptable, at any rate from the political point of view.In fact, neither of these methods, either separately or In conjunction, is likely to commend itself politically to the Dominions unless it is accompanied by some form of guarantee which will enable the minimum effect which,  in the opinion of the United Kingdom Government, will be produced by it to be clearly shown.    In other words, if the United Kingdom Government believe that e.g, a special propaganda campaign will increase the demand for, and raise the price of, Empire butter in the United Kingdom (and unless they do so believe, the offer of such a campaign is not worth making), it is worth consideration whether that offer should not be fortified by a price guarantee, thereby much increasing its attractiveness to the Dominions.
9 9 A &amp; t) SIS. guarantee of a fixed price not recommended.A guarantee could be devised which would avoid the heavy financial risk and the other objections to outright Bulk Purchase by a public marketing authority, and would yet give the producers the kind of security they desire.If the Government are prepared to consider at all the question of offering a guarantee,  such an offer might take the form of a guarantee either of a fixed price or of a price based on a defined relation to an independent standard market price.The Committee are of the opinion that it would be undesirable, both economically and politically, to guarantee a fixed price for Dominion butters.    The question of the level at which the price was to be fixed from time to time would almost inevitably give rise to friction between the UnitedKingdom Government and the Dominion Governments concerned.    Inany case,  if the guaranteed price was so low as to be reasonably safe to the Exchequer, it would be of little or no interest to the producers;    whereas, if it were fixed on thebasis of what the producers might regard as a reasonable figure,it -would involve a large contingent liability to the Exchequer.A loss of 25fi, for example, on the value of Dominion butterimported in 1929 would amount to about  5,500,000.     If theprice were fixed for any long period ahead, it would be a puregamble and would be liable to lead to friction between theparties concerned, as the open market price went markedly aboveor below the fixed price.    Further ja, guaranteed fixed price tothe producer would almost certainly have undesirable reactionsboth on quality and on quantity of production.      On the complications involved in giving a compensating advantage to thehome producer it is unnecessary to enlarge.1&apos;3. guarantee of a price defined ,In relationJto the price of Danish^ Butter . * ..... ----- - -     -.....-.....An alternative is to guarantee a price in relation to the open market price.    A suitable independent standard is supplied
9 9 ctv* O tit&apos;by the price of Danish butter in London.     In the case of Australia and New Zealand, their Dairy Produce Boards would consign butter to the central marketing authority who would dispose of it in the market through agents at current prices. The guarantee would operate if, at the end of a season of twelve months,  the price realised fell short of the prescribed price, which would be defined as a certain percentage of the price of Danish butter.      In case of a deficiency being disclosed on either Australian or New Zealand butter, the amount would be paid to the Dairy Produce Board concerned, who alone would have direct relations v/ith the producers.     It would be for the central marketing authority to take such steps in the direction of increasing the demand for Empire butter as would if possible ensure that current prices did not fall below the prescribed price, and for this purpose a propaganda campaign,  such as is referred to in paragraph 10 above, would no doubt be necessary. The risk of loss to the Exchequer would depend on (a)  the effectiveness of the campaign and (b)  the relation of the prescribed price to the price of Danish Butter.      The price to be aimed at would be that which it is hoped that Dominion butter would fetch when a definite goodwill in favour of the Empire product has been established in the districts where Danish butter is at present in the ascendant.     The guarantee of any price in excess of this figure would clearly be in the nature of a permanent subsidy, which is not contemplated.      It is thought that at the present time an offer of a guarantee on the basis of a price for New Zealand finest IG5S below that of Danish finest would involve a minimum risk to the Exchequer and would be attractive to the Dominions concerned.      (In 1929 New Zealand finest was about 0% below Danish finest;    in 1930 about lOJb; and at the present time it is about 15%)*It would be essential that existing standards of quality and methods of grading should be maintained unimpaired,  and
sj     p6j tj 0some machinery of inspection and arbitration would have to he provided.     The prescribed ratio to the Danish price would only he fixed for twelve months ahead and would require fresh consideration for each season.The applicability of such a scheme to other Dominions would depend on the existence or creation in the Dominion concerned of suitable centralised exporting organisations.      Otherwise they could not benefit by the scheme.14*    The Home Dairy Industry.      It should he emphasised that any scheme involving liabilities to the Exchequer for furthering the marketing of Dominion butter would almost inevitably give rise to a demand by the home producer for compensating advantages to home dairy products (not necessarily butter).    On the information before us,  the home butter producers are not now organised in a form which would enable them to take advantage of a scheme of this kind.15.    Summary.(a) For reasons indicated in paragraphs 6,  7 and 8 of this Report, the Committee suggest for the consideration of Ministers that,  in so far as the preparation of proposals for submission to the Ottawa Economic Conference is concerned, no further consideration should be given to the application to Dominion butter of(i) A Quota scheme, or (ii) An Import Board scheme,  or (iii) Outright Bulk Purchase.(b) The Committee suggest that the practical objective of any scheme relating to butter should be to increase the demand for Empire butter and. thus raise the price received by the Dominion producer more nearly to the level of that  received by the Danish producer and eventually cause more butter to be produced in the Dominions and sold here (paragraph 5).
(c) The simplest and most direct way of increasing the demand for Empire &quot;butters would he an intensive campaign of propaganda and publicity to be conducted by the Empire Marketing Board at a cost of  50,000 to  60,000 per annum for a period of three or five years (paragraph 10).     An outline of a scheme on these lines is set out in Appendix III.(d) As an adjunct to a special propaganda campaign and as a means of furthering sales it might prove desirable for the United Kingdom Government through the Empire Marketing Board to co-operate with the Dominion producers&apos; organisations in establishing the principle of centralised control of marketing (paragraph 9 ) on the lines suggested in Appendix II.     This re-organisation of trade channels need not by itself involve any financial liability to the Exchequer.      It would, however, provide the necessary machinery for any scheme of price guarantee,(e) The suggestion at (c) and (d) above, however, would be of little political value at Ottawa unless accompanied by a guarantee that the price realised for Dominion butters should not fall below a defined relation to the price of Danish butter. This would involve the Exchequer in a liability, if sales did not yield prices up to or above that level (paragraphs 11 and 13).(f) The reaction of any scheme on the home dairy industry is explained in paragraph 14   and will need careful consideration. Points for decision.Ministers are accordingly asked(a) whether in the case of butter they approve theproposal to give no further consideration to(l) a Quota,(2) an Import Board,(3) Outright Bulk Purchase,  and(4) a guaranteed fixed price;(b) whether they desire that a more detailed examination should be made of the plans for
9 $ o 6 St)(l) a special propaganda campaign in the United Kingdom for Empire butter at a cost of, say,  50,000 to  60,000 per annum for three or five years;(2) assistance in the organisation of centralised marketing of Empire butter without further necessary cost to the Exchequer;whether they desire that a more detailed examination should be made of the possibility of a price guarantee for Empire butter entailing a possible liability to the &quot;Exchequer not exceeding the difference between the proceeds of sale and a price based on a defined relation&apos; to the Danish price;   andin the event of an affirmative decision on (b) and (c)  above, whether they are willing to authorise confidential consultation with a few selected representatives of trading interests and producers with a view to the working out of practicable schemes.
CABINET,COMMITTEE ON BEQPOSED BIPEEIAL ^OONOMIG CONFERENCE AT OTTAWA.PARCEL post RATES BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA^ ^ n&amp; is ijI circulate herewith, for the cons id.er at ion of my colleagues on the Comaittoe, a memorandum.regarding a proposal revision of the parcel psst rates between the United. Kingdom   and Canada.     The question of tho revision of those&apos;rates was raised in June 1930 by tka Canadian (Mackenzie King) Government, who suggested that the rates should be reduced to the pre-war level.     The presont memorandum doals with a proposed reduction in these ratos, which, though smaller than that siiggested in June, would, it is understood, be acceptable to the presont Canadian Government.     This redaction would involve a loss of revenue to tho Exchequer here and to the Canadian Exchequer ef about  32,000 and  20,000 per annum,  respectively, en the basis of tho present traffic.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in October last,-was unwilling to approve these reduced rates, but although the mattor was discussed,informally during the Imperial Ooiiference, no reply has yot been sent to the Canadian Government and I think that the question is one of sufficient importance to merit its consideration In connection with our preparations for the Ottawa Conferonce.I need not stress the political desirabilityI--&quot;*&quot;*&quot; appendix ii
93^Aj     &apos;J^,/&apos;^rjQd.aav-^^ to offset where possible the effoots of the geographical propinquity of the Unite! States of America to Canada.     As to tha commercial side,  it is not possible to establish by statistical methods the precise offeiit upsn our trade with Canada which would, result from a reduction of parcel post rates, partly because the flow of international oommoree is determined by ma;;y economic facters whose individual effects ofton cannot bo isolated and partly because It is difficult to compute to what extant an increased use of the parcel post would encourage the bulk shipment of United Kingdom goods.The following points may, however, be noted as bearing on this quostion:-(i) Much l-awer parcol post rates are available to Canada frsm Franco, Germany and the United States than from the United Kingtlom;(ii) Chambers ef Commerce and similar bodies frequently ccmplain because aur parcel post rates to Canada are higher than some of those charged on the Continent;(iii) CanadLian G-evernment officials stated at the time of the recent Imperial Conference that the geographical advantages af the United States, combined with their lower ratas of postage, are a sorious obstacle to United Kingdom merchants in competing with United Status traders.     They pointed cut that the parcel post, particularly since the limit of weight- was extended beyond 11 pounds,  affords great advantages over other
9 ; 6j -channels of conveyance In the case of small quantities of goods, and they suggested that a reduction of parcel post rates might well suffice to divert to United Kingdom m0,230hants buisness which is now being secured by their United   States or European competitors:(iv) the statement in (iii)  are borne out by the fact that about 50$ of the parcels at present sent from this country to Canada are trade parcels,  e4g.,  articles of clothing such as gloves, ties , woollen underwear, etc.,  cigarettes cutlery,  stationery, and samples of various kinds;(v) on the other hand, parcels arriving here from Canada are for the most part private parcels; thus unless Canada proposes to develop some new trade,  under the lowered rates,  the commercial benefits of the reduction would seem likely to accrue chiefly to this country, (vi)    The offer to reduce rates was made by canada and it would be prima facie desirable to accept rather than to refuse such an offer, especially when made in the interests of inter-imperial trade and involving a sacrifice of revenue by the Canadian Government. I should like to suggest that the United kingdom representatives should bo authorised to^propose at the Ottawa Conference a trial for two years of the revised parcel post rates proposed on page 2 of tho attached memorandum on the understanding that at the end of that period the matter would be reviewed in the light of tho resulting figures of volume of traffic and loss to the
two Exchequers *     The Postmaster General has informed, me that he agrees, so far as he is concerned, with the views set out above *(Initialled)OMINIOKS OFFICEi27th February, 1931,
9 .!&apos;h c3MEMO RMDUMEarly in June tho Canadian (Mackenzie King) Government suggested by telegraph that the Parcel Post rates and credit between this country and Canada should revert to those in effect prior to the war,   &quot;in view of the common desire of the two Governments to facilitate inter-imps rial trade ;? they   pointed out that the rate for parcels between Canada and the United States was 14 cents per pound and if their proposal were accepted the rates between Canada and the United. Kingdom would be reduced from 18 to 12 cents per pound.      (Prom the more detailed figures supplied, by General Post Office it is evident that these figures are only a rough approximation).The suggestion to revert to pre-war rates dates however from the Postal Union Congress of 1929 when the Canadian Delegate made a similar proposal at dicussions which took place between tho United Kingdom and Dominion delegations oThe General Post Office was engaged at the time in a very elaborate survey of the whole field of the Imperial and Foreign Parcel P-est and it was for that reason that no immediate action was taken on the suggestion.The General Post Office, to which the present proposal was referred,  proposed to-the Treasury an arrangement whereby,  in order not to be forced to comply with the general practice under which reductions in Parcel Post rates have to bo extended to all foreign countries sending parcels in transit,  substantial reduction should -be affected by foregoing altogether that part of the existing charge which is attributable to sea conveyance, since it is the accepted practice that reductions in sea

Prem unofficial discussions with tho Canadian Post Office officials who were in England for the Imperial Conference tho General Poet Office has reason to think that the modified proposal would be accepted by Canada.Analysed i.	nto their	constituent	elements	thepresent rates to Ca:	a ad. a are	as Soilowe;-			3 lbs .		11 lbs a	15 lbs*United Kingdom land	10	*1     a J. -) X		.8c5C! o n o e a	7	1.2	1 c9	Canada land	10	1,8		3.9(to nearest -3d . )	23 .3d.	41t3d.	6s .01.	8s .9cL.-Urtdoj? -the General Post OfficeTs proposal the rates would bo:3 lbs.      7 lbs.       11 lbs.      15 lbs.

(11 lbs. being then the maximum, in either direction) .      It would, however, be sufficient,  in the opinion of the General Post Office, to act as a stimulus to parcel post traffic between
9; st-j -j: Othe United. Kingdom and. Canada and would approximate to certain specially favourable rates available to Canada from Prance and Germany .     Tho cost of the adjustment to the United Kingdom exchequer would be,  approximately and on the basis of the existing traffic,  23,000 per annum, while Canada would also lose in so far as their receipts for Inward parcel traffic would be reduced by 44., 9d., and 1.3d. respectively on parcels of 7 lbs, 11 lbs and 15 lbs.In the reverse direction;, the General P^st Office proposed that the Canadian Post Office should be asied similarly to eliminate the cost of sea conveyance and to credit the United KIngcLcm as a terminal rate with half the total postal rates it proposed to charge for this traffic.The existing rates from Canada to the UnitedKingdom are made up as follows:^3 lbs .      7 lbs .      10 lbs o     15 lbs, Canada land and sea 8-1 120 160United Kingdom land      24 40 66 906C cents132 cents   186cents 253 cents(Por parcels between 1 lb. and 10 lbs * there is adifferent charge for each weight, but the above figuresonly aro shown for simplicity and comparison with the outward charges).     The pre-war figures for this Service 84 centswere 36 cents,/and 120 cents,  respectively, for parcels rf 3 lbs. 7 lbs&quot; and 10 lbs.   The cost of the proposed adjustment so far as tho United Kingdom is concerned,  is estimated at  4,000.      Sufficient data    are not available to ealculato exactly the corresponding cost.
9 I fifo &amp; 0to Osjaad-a, but according to tho best estimates which could be formed by Da9 General Post Offics the probable loss to Canadian revenues for the reduction in both directions would he of the order of  20,000 a year.      The loss to both parties would of course increase if the traffic devolped in this connection the General Post Office observed that situated politically and geographically as she Is, Casa&amp;a is necessarily exposed, to a flood of newspapers and other publications from the United States; considerations sulphuric.ilar to these, which had long been regarded as justifying an exceptionally low rate for magazine post to Canada (Involving a loss of  56,000 por annum) should be gives due weight, in the examination of thy present suggestion.In reply to a request for tho Secretary of Staters views, the Treasury wore informed that Mr. Thomas felt that the lEmediate loss which the adoption ef tho proposal would entail to the Unitod^JD-n^d&amp;m Exchequer ( 32,t?00 per annum, representing a total loss *j.b tho service of  39,000 per annum, as against the existing loss of  7,000 per annum) -might woll be more than offset by resultant advantages, and that he had no reason to think that the new Government, in Canada would take a viow of the matter different from that of thoir predecessors oAt tho communication ions Committee of the Imperial &apos;Cor.feronce, a resolution was passed (and accepted by the Canadian Delegation)  in. the following terras:-&quot;&apos;:&apos;&apos;&apos;-&apos;,T&quot;&quot;&quot; 7&apos;        -------
&quot;Shg reduot ie:i on existing parcel post rates within the Bttpira is desirable in tho interests of trade and commerce, but the Cor-ferfence recognises that this Question must be governed by considerations of general finanoial policy&quot; .The Canadian delegation when accopting thin Resolution apparently did net know what tho decision would be as regards the reduction of parcel post rates botwnon the United Kingdom and Canada, but they have since boen warned to expect a refusal.      In any case tho Conference itself decided that no action should be taken on the aho^a resolution and it is not iucludod in the final Summary.The Treasury have new stated thatt after careful consideration, they regret that, they aro unable to agree to tho .propesal made by the General Post Offloe for a reduction in the parcel post rate between tho Unitod Kir-gdom and Canada.OMIHIOBS GfPICE.February, 1931.
