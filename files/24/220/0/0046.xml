Blst March, 1931.0160 1675MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.1. In writing an appreciation of the general military situation, I propose to confine myself to Europe. It is not to be inferred that the military situation outside Europe is without anxiety but, seeing that this paper is being written with special reference to disarmament, T have assumed that the Committee desire information more especially as regards the Continent, which contains the greater part of the world&apos;s armaments and no inconsiderable part of its military problems. I have also, for the purpose of this paper, ignored the possibility ot concerted action by the League against an aggressor. I do not underrate the importance of such action, which, whether in the form of economic pressure or military sanctions, might prove decisive, provided that the Council is unanimous and the members of the League remain true to the pledges they have given. It is, however, the element of uncertainty and the fear that the whole machinery of peaceful settlement and sanctions against the aggressor may break down that cause states to seek to justify the maintenance of their present scale of armaments. I therefore propose to examine the military problems of Europe without taking into consideration the possibility of action by the League.2. If the situation of Europe to-day be compared with that of 1914, there is no doubt that the war material at the disposal of armies is more powerful and destructive, while the preparations for chemical warfare and for the mobilization of industry, which hardly existed in 1914 in many countries, have reached formidable proportions.It has not been possible to increase the effectives of armies because service is in most cases universal, in the literal sense of the word, and the armies of the more important military powers are in fact only limited by the national birthrate. Expenditure in nearly all countries has risen steadily since the war as- a reference to the Appendix will show. Since 1924 the combined military budgets of Germany, France, Italy, the United States and Russia have increased by no less a sum than  154,000,000. Only in the case of Japan and ourselves has any decrease taken place, amounting in respect of our own military expenditure to  4,500,000. These increases have been largely devoted to greater reserves bf war material^ preparations -for industrialimobilization, fortifications and to considerable increases&apos;in long: service&apos;personnel. There- has&quot; been a general tendency to reduce&apos; the period of service-of-the ^ordinary conscript but. this has been almost invariably accompanied by large increases in long service personnel. The consequence is that there is littler or no diminution in military efficiency as the result of the&apos;reduction in the length of service; *. At the same time- pre-military training of youths has! become very general, which goes some way to compensate for the shorter term of service. -   - &quot; ; ;i(b31/8)   60   4/31   w.o.p.   5535-2
3. Europe is dominated to-day by three great military problems, the Franco-German problem, the Franco-Italian problem (which are to some extent co-related) and the Russian problem. The basis of all these problems is political, and it is out of place for me to discuss this aspect at any length in a paper of this kind.Tue Fitanco-German Problem.4. The French army is undoubtedly the most formidable military machine in the world to-day.   The Higher Command is excellent, the moral and fighting qualities exceptionally good, the reserves of material and preparations for industrial mobilization are probably adequate and the trained reserves total about 5,000,000 men.  A most powerful and modern system of fortifications is being constructed along the eastern frontier at a cost of  30,000,000, which will be completed in 1934 or 1935.   Not content with this, France has further re-insured by forming a network of military alliances which encircle Germany with a ring of steel.   The Little Entente, Belgium and Poland are all the military vassals of France with armies trained on French lines and in some instances by French missions.   These armies are of varying military quality and without sufficient reserves of material in some cases for a long war. Assuming, however, that the military agreements are faithfully kept, some 130 divisions of other nations will be placed under the control of the French General Staff for war with Germany.   This, with the French army, produces a grand total of about 180 divisions. It is not suggested that the whole of these forces are available for the invasion of Germany.    A large proportion of the Polish army will be engaged in watching Russia, while the whole of the Roumanian army will be watching Russia on one flank and Hungary on  the other.    Czechoslovakia, apart  from detaching a number of divisions to deal with Hungary, would be able to place the remainder at the disposal of France.   The Belgian army would be completely at French disposal.   France will be embarrassed by the Italian attitude if she is at war with Germany.   Nothing is clearer in Europe to-day than the gradual emergence of a revisionist bloc of powers consisting of the ex-enemy states and Italy as opposed to France and her satellites. The Italian army would, however, be largely neutralized by Yugo-Slavia, and France would be content to stand on the defensive on her naturally strong Italian frontier, detaching perhaps 8-10 divisions for the purpose.   It is quite impossible to calculate the number of divisions which France would have available to deal with Germany as everything would depend upon the attitude of Italy, Russia and Hungary.   Putting it, however, at its worst, France with the aid of her allies should have no difficulty in defeating Germany while Italy would be fully engaged with Yugo-Slavia.5. Germany has a small army of 100,000 well-trained men. a military police force, of which perhaps 50,000 would be available for military operations, and a large reserve of partially trained man power in her patriotic associations. Effectives would be ample but serious difficulties would be encountered in providing the necessary material. Possibly 14 or, at the outside, 21 divisions are the most she could conceivably put into the field in the early stages and these would be quite inadequate to meet the French army. The weak point in the French armour is the slowness of their mobilization. They fear that Germany may launch an attack with her long service army and police almost simultaneously with a declaration of war. It is difficult to believe that prepar-ations for such a coup could be concealed entirely. Should, however, a highly trained and mobile force of, say, 150,000 Germans beat the French in a race for the Rhine bridgeheads in the first few days, the French mobilization scheme would be much upset. The situation would be serious but not irretrievable, and nothing could prevent the ultimate defeat of Germany if she were mad enough to launch such an offensive.6. France also relies upon precise guarantees from Great Britain to come to her assistance immediately under the Locarno Treaty, if she is the victim of an aggres-sion by Germany. Italy is also a guarantor under this Treaty but it is improbable that France is unduly optimistic as to help from that quarter. Our guarantee has considerable moral value but its material one is small so long as our mobilization is so slow. Owing to our lack of essential services and reserves, we can contribute only 1 division and a cavalry brigade after a fortnight, a division and another cavalry brigade 2 months, one more division at the end of 4^- months and 2 more at the ond of months. This fact shows how greatly Great Britain has disarmed since 1914 when 5 infantry divisions and a cavalry division had landed in France in 3 weeks and a sixth infantry division was ready in England.7. To sum up, France does not seek war or desire any military adventure, she only wushes to keep what she has got in peace. She greatly fears German intentions towards her and is anxious about the future, when  the  restrictions  of the peace
treaties will have been relaxed and the facts of population, economic resources and industrial efficiency will be against her. So far as the present is concerned, with her formidable military preparations, her network of alliances, and the military impotence of Germany due to treaty restrictions, neither she nor her satellites have in fact anything to fear from Germany, and are, from a military point of view, considerably over-insured.The Franco-Italian Problem.8. Mussolini, with his profound knowledge of his compatriots in peace and war, has realized their essentially unmilitary qualities. Much of the Fascist regime, the military organization and display, the flamboyant speeches, the encouragement of sport, the intensive military training of youths have been directed to the sole purpose of breathing into the Italian that virility and military ardour which he so conspicuously lacks. There is no doubt that, as a result, the moral of the nation and army has greatly improved and they would probably fight bravely in the early stages of a war at any rate. &quot;Whether this new spirit would survive hardships and early reverses is doubtful and the moral of the Italian army, in spite of the Fascist regime, will always be an uncertain factor. Although Mussolini is probably sincere for this reason, if for no other, in saying that Italy will never seek war, there are many bones of acute contention between Italy and France which might produce a quarrel.9. The Italian military problem is a difficult one. She is faced with a virile and warlike enemy on the east, with whom her relations are thoroughly bad. If the only problem were a straight fight with Yugo-Slavia, her numbers, her reserves of material and industrial resources should be sufficient to give her victory. But France would never allow Yugo-Slavia to be over-run, and a war between the latter and Italy would inevitably cause France to mobilize. This act alone should be sufficient to cause Italy to climb down. She could not possibly wage a victorious war on both fronts. For similar reasons an Italian attack upon France might gain temporary successes in the provinces of Nice and Savoy, but the intervention of the Yugo-Slav army in their rear, coupled with an eventual French offensive along the historic lines of invasion of northern Italy must bring Italy to her knees.10. A war waged by a combined Italy and Germany, particularly a Germany freed from the restrictions of the peace treaties, against France would have greater chances of success. Even in such a case, provided the French allies remained staunch, it is difficult to foresee a successful result except in the more remote future, if Germany became again a great military nation.11. To sum up, Italy&apos;s frontiers are naturally very strong. To the west she has the Alps ; the northern and eastern frontiers are mountainous and present formidable obstacles. The key to the north, the Brenner Pass, is in Italian hands. If Italy were content to pursue a pacific policy and maintain an army solely for defensive purposes, her present armaments are difficult to justify and could be much reduced. It is fair, however, to say that, with a population almost equal to that of France, she does not train the same number of men, neither has she the same reserves of material nor is her military budget nearly so large. The reason is not that her aims are necessarily more pacific but that the financial resources are lacking for a greater military effort.The Russian Problem.12. Russia is the great enigma and the great obstacle to any general scheme for the limitation and reduction of armaments. Though there is no state in Europe so secure from invasion, the Soviet Government never ceases to preach to its people the imminent danger of attack. Much of this attitude is due to the desire to exact the necessary sacrifices from their people to face this so-called danger ; but the phenomenon remains and, however ill-founded, there is in this belief an undoubted substratum of sincerity.13. Soviet Russia has unlimited resources in trained man power ; her peace strength is the greatest in Europe ; her reserves of war material are small, but the completion of the Five Year Plan, which is largely military in its conception, will go far to correct this weakness. The moral of the Red Army is improving ; they are well fed and clothed and much better off than the peasants and workmen, from which classes the recruits are drawn. They may be expected to give a good account of themselves if fighting on Russian soil,, but in a war beyond their frontiers their moral might be of a more doubtful quality.14. Although Russia is able to mobilize 100 divisions in the early stages of a war, the limiting factor is the railways, roads and mechanical transport.   The railways to the(5535) a &apos;i
.froptier are few and the condition of the rolling stock and permanent way is desperate at present. Roads are few and bad and mechanical transport is scarce. I have come to the.conclusion that in Europe the Red Army, owing to inability to maintain an adequate number of divisions in front of railhead, would have great difficulty in carrying out any large offensive operations beyond the frontiers except against the smaller Baltic republics and Roumania fighting without allies. The completion of the Five Year Plan and the overhaul and re-equipment of the railways might necessitate a revision of these conclusions a few years hence. The longer Russia can secure peace the better she will be prepared for war.15. Poland, with an army of 40 divisions of good quality and high moral, is confident of her ability to withstand an attack by the Red Army. She has a military agreement with Roumania for combined action against Russia. The Roumanian Army with &apos;M) to 34 divisions is inefficient;, ill led and badly equipped and would not be of very great assistance. Both of these countries have a military agreement with France and it may be assumed that, while French conscripts could hardly be induced to fight in eastern Europe, some military assistance and ample supplies of war material would be forthcoming.i6. What Poland chiefly fears is to become embroiled with Germany about ihe Corridor and to find herself compelled to face east and west. There is reason to believe that plans for military co-operation have been prepared hy the Russian and German General Staffs, but their exact nature is unknown. A combined attack by Russia and Germany upon Poland must inevitably bring in France with all her forces and this would spell disaster for Germany with her present armaments. It is hardly credible that Germany will be so ill-advised as to make such an attempt. Even her neutrality, however, would be a grave anxiety to Poland, who would be compelled to detach a number of divisions to watch Germany.17. To sum up, it is believed that Soviet Russia, though she might overrun Bessarabia temporarily, is not yet capable ot conducting operations to a successful conclusion against Poland and Roumania if they act together and are supported by France. A military combination of Germany and Russia against Poland is unlikely, as this would leave Germany completely at the mercy of France. A settlement of the question of the Polish Corridor would do much to bring peace in this part of the world. Reviewing all the factors, it cannot be said that Poland or Roumania or any of the states bordering upon Russia is excessively armed. The vast armed forces of the Soviet create a feeling of tension and insecurity, which expresses itself in the maximum of armaments that these states can afford. Nor would a promise by Russia to disarm materially alter the situation, as no faith would be put in Russian promises. It is difficult to believe, therefore, that any reduction in this part of the world is possible. Failure to reduce in this area naturally has its repercussions further west.:;lqni3X9 *m*inl &apos;io ,y. &quot; r,.,.,&apos;,!..,,&apos;       ,, 1 he British Military Problem.-join.:.! linifirfir ort! i.JY/vkSi/:TheBritish army is almost unique&quot; among the armies of the world, in that its strftngth-^dogSj^npfci depend upon the strength of the armies of its neighbours or its greatest potential enemies. Its role is that of an Imperial police force to safeguard our frontiers,;to keepjibe peace in our many possessions, and to provide reinforcements in case-o .maJQr;pperatipns on the frontier of India or elsewhere. It may be compelled to conduct military operations in various parts of the world, where the writ of the League oftNations d.oesj;not   run, where no military assistance will be forthcoming under Article,16:,pfrrt^e Covenant and where wild tribesmen will not have subscribed to any disarmament; convention. No one can, I think, claim that the size of our army in 19.14nWia8,;eith.t)ri!iprovocative or excessive. After the war we were the first nation in Europe jto!.revert immediately to our pre-war army and to voluntary service. Moreover,,the,,Special Reserve which had been an important factor in our 1914 mobilization arrangements was abolished including, in addition to other arms, 3 Special Reserve: c^yajry;tregiments and ,101 ,Special Reserve infantry battalions. . Later on we vrmt$W$hf$iil,X%4&apos;i$:&amp; the;military.iry,ad$^r ,ojf &apos;^.&apos;^o^rpment. even accepted the risk of^heavyired^ip/PS; below ^ the Cabinet decision that at.TOajfirVJw^Ef,Wjas wRkely:fpr.:the next 1,0. years. The army was then reduced by 9 cavalry regiments, 61 batteries and companies of artillery, 22 companies of engineers, 21 battalions of British infantry and 6 battalions of Colonial and native troops. At the same time our rate of mobilization was slowed down and we are now able to mobilize only 2 divisions and a cavalry division in the first three months of war, as compared with 6 infantry divisions and a cavalry division in under 3 weeks in 1914, while the mobilization of the Expeditionary Force could not be completed till 6-^ months have elapsed.
a y W19. Since that decision was taken, and particularly during the last few months, the international situation has steadily deteriorated and we may be compelled to revise the estimate upon which that reduction was based. Apart from the European situation and our commitments under the Locarno Treaty and the Covenant, the possibilities of serious conflict and disturbance in the Middle East, India and the Far East do not grow less. Palestine flared up in 1929 ; the policy of Russia in Central Asia and Afghanistan as. the declared enemy of the British Empire is a constant anxiety to us ; last summer we were within an ace of rebellion on the North-West Frontier of India surpassing anything in that region since 1897, which would have strained our military resources very heavily ; the situation in China, with our vast trade interests, is still an anxious one. We have done all we can in advance of other powers and I cannot recommend to you that it is advisable in the present situation to reduce the army any further ; indeed, our present unpreparedness, for lack of the necessary reserves of material and essential services, is a cause of grave anxiety.20. The only reproach that has ever been levelled at us at Geneva is that we have disarmed too much, and that our army is so small that it is incapable of fulfilling our international obligations. It is pertinent to remember that under Article 8 of the Covenant these international obligations do exist, and that we are expected to tnaintain a force capable of complying with them.21. If further reductions are to be made in the army, policy must be altered. The army is pared to the bone, adequate coast defences are practically non-existent, and even barracks cannot be reconditioned as they should be. With steadily increasing risks we cannot continue to shoulder our present national commitments with reduced forces.Conclusion.22. From this review the conclusion is clear that, save among the states bordering upon Russia, the armaments of the more important military powers.in Europe are too big and with considerable reductions would still be adequate for defensive purposes. What is required of course is, in the somewhat hackneyed phrase,. &quot;Moral Disarmament.&quot; Until the causes that make for war can be removed radical disarmament will be difficult to achieve.23. I have not been asked to make any recommendations as to how disarma-ment could be carried out, but I venture to make one observation. One of the greatest, stumbling blocks at present is that France and many other nations base the whole of their armaments not upon any scientific principle of the number of men required to defend their frontiers but upon the simple rule that every man without distinction must serve. They maintain that everything else is undemocratic and that, politically, it is impossible to advocate a system of conscription which, either by lot or by means of large numbers of exemptions allows a proportion of their young men to escape service in the army. The system of large exemptions works perfectly well, as a matter of fact, in Japan and in some of the smaller European states. The fact is that world disarmament is really being -hielblh tfp Jeverywhere to-day by a fanatical and fantastic devotion to an alleged democratic ^priticipte of universal service. I make this point because it is not generally ^realized, - Until a wedge is driven into this basic principle there is no hope of getting any readjustment.24. What is required is the establishment of a more equitable -ratio&apos;-fhfetween&apos; the over-armed states and those which have disarmed, among whom we are&apos; the-hlmost prominent. The armies of France, Italy. Belgium-, Czechoslovakia and Yugo-Slavia could be considerably reduced, and the way to do it is to call fewer-m^nto the colours and to restrict the long-service personnel. It is difficult to see&apos; what&apos;&apos;cab :&quot;be&apos;;dOne in eastern Europe unless some means can be devised not only for -inducing- Russia to accept reduction, but for convincing her neighbours that she has carried&apos;it OCtt&apos;.!UV:i -25.

ANNEX A.Note; on Preparations for Chemical Warfare.1. If we were to go to war with, out-of-date gas masks and unable to apply effective measures of decontamination, our troops would be as defenceless against new forms of gas as were our troops in April, 1915, against the first gas attack. Again, the mere fact of war breaking out between Great Britain and a European power would mean that an aggressor had broken the Pact of Paris and might therefore be expected to break any other treaty, including the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925. The civilian population of London might thus find itself exposed to gas attack from the air.2. Therefore, although His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom has signed and ratified the Geneva Gas Protocol, we cannot afford to allow our anti-gas defence measures to be less efficient than the offensive measures which we know to be potentially applicable by other nations. A certain amount of research must, therefore, be carried out in regard to the prepara-tion of toxic gases and their reaction on possible antidotes.3. The small gas warfare establishments maintained at Porton and Sutton Oak are concerned solely with research into anti-gas defence measures, the efficiency of gas masks, the casualty-producing power of chemical warfare weapons used in the Great War or suggested by foreign powers for use in future wars, e.g., spraying of gas from aeroplanes and use in aerial bombs, methods of decontamination of gassed areas and so on, and with the training of officers and non-commissioned officers in these subjects.4.

ANNEX C.Note on the Military Problems of Great Britain. 1. Basis of Estimates.Of recent years the War Office, in regulating the strength and state of readiness of the military forces maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom om, has been hound by the Government decision that &quot; it should be assumed for the purpose of framing the Estimates that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years.&quot; In consequence the Army of to-day is smaller and less ready for war than it was in 1914, and is not in a sufficient state of preparedness to be able to intervene effectively in a European theatre.2. Overseas Garrisons.To deal first with the problem of providing adequate local security for our possessions and interests overseas. In the Far East not only have the lives and property of British nationals in China and Malaya to be protected, but the naval bases of Hong Kong and Singapore have to be secured against the danger of attack. Owing to the possibility of a recrudescence of civil war in China, and the Communist-bandit menace on the Yangtze, the strength of the China garrison has to be maintained at 6 battalions, including 1 Indian battalion. There is 1 British battalion at Singapore, although for several years it has been proposed to station a second battalion there Such a step is highly desirable but, with so many battalions already abroad, it is at present difficult to provide this additional battalion.The British portion of the garrison of India amounts to 5 cavalry regiments, 63 bat-batteries of artillery, 45 infantry battalions and 8 armoured car companies. What the future British garrison of India will be must depend upon the situation resulting from the deliberations now in progress as to the future status of that country. The unstable political situation in Afghanistan, and the recent tribal disturbances on the North-West Frontier both, however, point to the conclusion that the British forces in India are at present barely adequate to the tasks they may be called upon to perform.The main duties of the garrisons of Egypt and the Sudan, apart from the maintenance of internal security, are to safeguard the Suez Canal and to protect the administration at Khartoum and its communications with the sea, For these duties 3 cavalry regiments (including 1 cavalry armoured car regiment), 6 batteries of artillery and 8 infantry battalions are required. The situation in the Near East generally, and the ever present possihility of troops being required at short notice to reinforce such places as Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Palestine or Aden, make the provision of a local reserve essential. We aim, therefore, at maintaining a Mediterranean garrison of 6 battalions, divided between Malta and Gibraltar, from which a mobile force of up to 4 battalions could be organized while still leaving Malta and Gibraltar each with a garrison of 1 battalion. As, however, 2 battalions have been stationed in Palestine since the communal outbreaks of 1929, this potential mobile force has dwindled to 2 battalions.The West Indies and Bermuda have a garrison of 1 battalion.We thus require 67 battalions abroad, leaving only 59 out of our 126 line battalions for service at home. Even so, certain important possessions, e.g., Sierra Leone, have heen denuded of British troops, and the land defences have been handed over to the local Governments. Should future changes in the political situation demand the restoration of British garrisons to these places, a still further strain will be imposed upon our slender resources.3. Garrisons at home and the Expeditionary Force.The strength of the Expeditionary Force is regulated by the number of units stationed at home, whose primary duty is to provide in peace the trained personnel necessary for maintaining the units located abroad, and it is to-day limited to 1 cavalry division (of only 2 cavalry brigades) and 5 divisions. With 67 battalions abroad there would be left at home 59 line battalions, plus 10 Guards battalions, from which to find the 60 battalions required for the 5 divisions of the Expeditionary Force. This leaves only 9 battalions for the necessary line of communication troops, for the maintenance of internal security in the United Kingdom, and for the reinforcement of threatened points outside the theatre of war.It is thus clear that the strength of the Expeditionary Force is not dictated by the magnitude of the liabilities it may be called upon to meet. Of late, owing to the assumption referred to in paragraph 1, the immediate plans of the army have been based upon preparedness for an extra-European war. The conditions under which such a war would be fought make it probable that operations would develop slowly. Consequently it has been possible to accept temporarily a reduced degree of readiness for the Expeditionary Force, thereby to some extent balancing the needs of economy with the dictates of policy.The earliest dates at which the several contingents of the Regular Expeditionary Force could be ready for service overseas in war as fighting formations are as follows : (x represents a date not less than 2 weeks after the order to mobilize.)1st Contingent, after x weeks 1 division and1 cavalry brigade.2nd Contingent, after x plus 6 weeks  1 division. 1 cavalry brigade.
3rd Contingent, after x plus 4 months  1 division.4th Contingent, after x plus 6 months  2 divisions.EacK division would be accompanied by the necessary proportion of non-divisional and some line of communication troops.Even on the above basis it would be difficult to complete mobilization owing to the shortage of trained reserves (partly technical reserves) ready to take the field. The divisional troops of the 5th Division are incomplete and the division could be brought up to establishment only after a period of months. It is clear that the present arrangements would be quite inadequate to meet a European crisis where military intervention to fulfil an international obligation, if it were to be effective, would have to be prompt.4. Coast Defence (Sea-front and Anti-aircraft).At the present time the bases and fuelling stations of the Empire are not adequately defended. Owing to the developments in naval gunnery our defended ports can be bombarded bv modern cruisers from outside the range of shore guns, while anti-aircraft defences against attack from the air are almost entirely lacking. It is approximately 30 years since any thorough renovation of our coast defences was carried out, aud they are now overdue for periodical overhaul, this most necessary work having been delayed mainly for reasons of economy. Even if the money were made available and work were to commence forthwith, several years must elapse before the required number of modern equipments, together with instruments and ammunition, could be manufactured and installed.In peace the personnel to man the coast defences is maintained at approximately only 50 per cent, of the strength which would be required in war. Reinforcement would, however, be a matter of grave difficulty, as there is no reserve of trained personnel available for the purpose.5. Air Defence of London.Of the anti-aircraft batteries and searchlight companies which are to be provided for the air defence of London, approximately 50 per cent, have still to be found.6. Summary.(a) Our every day peace time responsibilities overseas are so heavy that there are more infantry battalions stationed abroad than our organization is designed to provide. Even so the garrisons of Singapore and the Mediterranean are weaker than is desirable, and certain important possessions have no British garrison at all.(b) Owing to the &quot; ten years assumption,&quot; our immediate military preparations envisage an extra-European war, and can be considered adequate to meet such an emergency only because the conditions under which such a war would probably be fought, make it likely that operations would develop slowly.(c) Our present mobilization arrangements are entirely inadequate to meet a crisis in Europe and are at the most barely sufficient to provide for a serious emergency in the Middle East and India.(d) Our coast defences are completely out of date, are inadequate to meet the scale of attack to which they may be exposed under modern conditions, and would take several years to modernize even if the money were available.2.

In case of threatened aggression or circumstances rendering war a likely contingency the General Staff state that the above measures will be at once put into operation as regards personnel, factories and raw material.Includes 2nd Reserves between ages 41 48.
5. Preparations for chemical warfare.France possesses a military anti-gas organization and technical services and maintains co-operation and research between the Army and her civilian chemical industry which latter receives an annual Government grant. Though officially no preparations are being made for offensive chemical warfare we have reason to believe that a limited supply of gas shells and tombs are maintained in peace and it is understood that it would require only 3 months to adapt the factories in France for the mass production of gas.6.

The Main Problem.The military problems of France may be said to fall under two main headings, viz., the German Problem and the Italian Problem. The basic causes of these two problems are fundamental and notorious.The French General Staff, therefore, must envisage, a war against either country separately or against the two combined. Thus, France considers that the defence of her eastern frontiers constitutes a single problem on the solution of which French military thought is primarily concentrated.2. The French Eastern Frontiers. To enable her covering force to fulfil its role, a most powerful and modern system of defences is now in course of construction along the entire German and Italian frontiers and this should be completed by 1934. These defences will consist of two non-continuous lines, viz., a forward line on the frontier consisting of mutually supporting machine gun strong points and a second line in rear of this consisting of a non-continuous system of fortified regions, with mobile engineer dumps and areas prepared for destruction and inundations designed for the defence in depth of the forward line.3. The French Army.The French active peace army comprises 25 divisions (which include 8 divisions on a higher establishment basis and 5 colonial expeditionary force divisions at war strength) and 5 cavalry divisions.Of the 8 higher establishment divisions, 6 are located on the German Frontier and 2 on the Italian frontier. The whole active army should have completed its mobilization in 7 days, and could be employed on the frontiers within 10 days of the outbreak of war.Its role is to provide a covering force on the eastern frontier of France behind which the remainder of her army can mobilize in two echelons of 20 divisions each. The first consisting of 1st Reserve Divisions will be mobilized in 3 weeks and the second within 6 months at latest. In addition, within this period, from 5 to 10 divisions could be obtained from overseas, making a total force of approximately 75 divisions.The expansion of the French army under her mobilization arrangements is a relatively slow one, owing to the fact that her active divisions will consist-, in peace, of 50 per cent, recruits. In order to remedy this defect, and enable the army to fulfil this role, the intention is to call up the &quot; Disponibles &quot; (last three conscript classes making a total of 700,000 men) on the mere threat of war before mobilization. The remainder of her army will be composed of 75 per cent, reservists.It will be seen that, in the opening phase, that is up to the first 3 weeks, France could, in the event of war with Germany, dispose of 20 divisions on the German frontier leaving 5 covering the Italian front, or, in the event of war wiih Italy, she might employ 15 divisions on the Italian frontier and to reinforce her North African garrisons, leaving 10 facing Germany.In the event of a combined war on both the German and Italian fronts, it may be presumed that the Italian frontier, being already a formidable banker, will be held by the minimum of force, say, 8 divisions, whilst 3. divisions would be required to reinforce North Africa, thus leaving only 14 divisions available, in the opening phase, to deal with Germany. There is no doubt that this critical period in this particular contingency is one of the chief anxieties of the French&quot; General Staff.-
It is estimated that, in the worst eventuality, i.e,, a war on two fronts, France must be prepared to meet an attack hy a maximum of 31 German and Italian divisions within three weeks which she, on interior lines, can meet with a force of 42 divisions in the same period. It follows that, in the event of a war on either front separately, the French situation is correspond-ingly improved and this again will be further strengthened should the French receive the support of her potential allies.4. Conclusions.Taking into consideration the forces at her disposal in the eventualities referred to above it is considered that : (a) In the event of war with Germany only. After the period of a purely defensive action essential to ensure the completion of her mobilization, the French army will undertake an offensive into German territory with a view to : (i) Securing the Rhine bridges.(ii) Moving on strategic points in Germany.(J&quot;) In the event of a war with Italy only.  After a similar period of &quot; couverture &quot; defence, an offensive would be undertaken into Lombard y on the lines of past historic invasions.(c) In the event of a war against Germany and Italy combined. In this case, the period of a first defensive phase would be prolonged to a month as, until the first echelon of reserve divisions are fully available, the offensive operations ultimately envisaged could not be reconciled with the requirements of security. Even in this case, however, it is considered that it would be the aim of the French General Staff to advance north-eastwards into German territory, directed on the Mannheim-Mainz-Bingen bridgehead and thence on Cassel in order to ensure that the war was not fought on French soil. The Italian frontier could be held with comparative economy of force.There is a further contingency to consider, that in which Germany might become involved in an eastern commitment and France brought into the war. In such a case, the French General Staff could profit by the situation by sending mobile and mechanized force? immediately to seize the Rhine crossings, and this could be done without waiting for the French &quot; couverture &quot; period to mature.3.

Italy is however compelled to import the greater part of her requirements in raw materials essential for the manufacture of munitions of all kinds.A comprehensive scheme of industrial mobilization has been worked out. All civil firms capable of producing munitions are under government supervision and every firm is supposed to keep up a mobilization scheme.5. Preparations for chemical warfare.Defensive.

Although membership is voluntary, the fact that very definite advantages in after life, both civil and military, are derived by members gives a strong impulse to the hoys of the country to join this movement. From 8 to 14 boys are classified as Balilla and from 14 to 18 they become Avanguardisti. The training includes camping, physical training, musketry and a strong development of the Fascist spirit. The Balilla-Avanguardisti movement is increasing year by year. In 1927 the total number of boyB enrolled was 800,000, this figure rising to 1,500,000 in 1930.On reaching the age of 18, youths must enter the Pre Militare (Pre Military) Organization which carries on the military training of all youths between the ages- of 18 and 20. This training has now been made compulsory, and those who have completed the courses successfully are entitled to certain reductions in their period of conscript service with the colours.In addition to the above, a youth of 18 may, if he has passed through the Balilla-Avanguardisti, join the National Militia, or, if he has not been through that organization, he can join the Fasci Giovanili di Combattimento which came into being at the end of 1930.

details of the latter organization have not yet been obtained, but within the first month of its inauguration 4^000 Fasci (Groups) were formed and 250,000 youths enrolled. At the age of 21 the period of 18 months&apos; conscript service, or less according to exemptions, must be undertaken.The National Militia is the foundation of the whole scheme. It is responsible for the Batilld-Avanfiuardisti and the Pre Militare movements and, with the exception of those periods spent with the Colours, supervises the training of the manhood of the nation from the age of 8 onwards.The National Militia was originally the party fighting force of Fascism and as such was purely political, but as Fascism has become more and more national in conception, the militia has gradually become identified with the state and is now recognized as forming part of the armed forces of the nation. The militia is organized into 32 Groups containing 134 Legions and autonomous Cohorts. The 32 Group Commands correspond to the 30 Army Divisional Com-mands and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. 80 &quot; Cohort &quot; battalions of militia have been earmarked for incorporation within the army on mobilization, of which two battalions are to form an integral part of each infantry division, and there are indications that this number may be increased to three in the future.There are in addition various special branches of Militia, such as Railway Militia, Frontier Militia, Anti-Aircraft Militia, Ports Militia, etc., which constitute a potential military reserve capable of being mobilized in a very short space of time. These special branches are, generally speaking, those which will carry out in war or in emergency the same duties which they perform in peace and represent the Fascist hold over the vital services and communications of the country.In case of war, those militiamen who have completed their conscript service and who do not belong to the 80 &quot; Cohort &quot; battalions or to the special branches of the militia would be available either to join the army as reservists or to provide reinforcements for existing or newly-formed &quot; Cohort &quot; battalions.Note on the military problems of Italy. 1. The main problem.The only considerable military problem before Italy is that arising out of her attitude of persistent hostility towards her two principal neighbours, France and Yugo-Slavia.The causes underlying these reciprocal antagonisms are deep-seated and well known, and although the. overt causes of friction between Italy and her two neighbours are distinct and independent, there can be little doubt that Italian hostility towards Yugo-Slavia is fundamentally a by-product of her bad relations with France, owing to the fact that Italy is convinced that in the event of war with France she will also have to face Yugo-Slavia as a French ally. Thus, in Italian eyes, the defence of her north-west and of her north-east frontiers constitute essentially a single problem, on the solution of which Italian military thought is primarily concentrated.2. The frontiers of Italy.The frontiers of Italy, throughout almost their entire length, follow the formidable mountain barrier of the high Alps. From the Mediterranean in the- west, apart from the narrow coastal plain, the Alps form a continuous barrier between Italy and France, across which military operations must be confined to half a dozen main passes easily defensible on either side. Thence eastward from Mt. Blanc, Switzerland offers neutral protection from the north up to the Austrian frontier, which is, in turn, secured by the strong barrier of the Brenner and the Carnic Alps. From Arnoldstein the frontier with Yugo-Slavia turns southward through the Julian Alps and Carniola to the Adriatic at Fiume. In the latter section, between Tolmino and the Adriatic, the physical difficulties of terrain, though still considerable, tend to diminish and do not present so strong an obstacle to military operations as does the remainder of Italy&apos;s mountain frontiers.3. Comparison of Forces.(a) Italy. The military organization of Italy comprises a peace army of 30 divisions, capable of expansion within about one month of the outbreak of war to twice that number, i.e., 60 divisions. Of the 30 divisions maintained in peace, 9, of which 4 are &quot; reinforced &quot; divisions at approximately war strength, are located facing the French frontier ; 7, including 3 &quot; reinforced &quot; divisions, face Yugo-Slavia ; while the remaining 14 divisions are distributed in other parts of Italy. To each frontier there is also allotted in peace one independent brigade of Alpine troops, whilst a third Alpine brigade is available, in reserve, for rapid transfer to either frontier. In addition, 2 &quot; Divisioni Celeri&quot; (composite cavalry divisions) are at present in process of formation, from existing units, at Bologna and Udine, and will shortly be available for service on either front. Thus it will be seen that in the initial phase of a war Italy might either : (a) concentrate a maximum force of 21 divisions against France, leaving 7 divisions for the defence of her Yugo-Slav frontier ; or (b) concentrate 19 divisions against Yugo-Slavia, leaving 9 divisions covering the French frontier.In this estimate, 2 divisions those in Sardinia and at Bari -have been omitted, since it is assumed that these divisions will be retained in their respective areas to provide the garrisons for the islands and at Zara. Elsewhere it is assumed that the function of internal security will be undertaken from mobilization by the National Militia. Subsequently, within the first month after the outbreak of war the 30 additional divisions to be formed on mobilization will become available for employment as required according to the situation.
fig?)O cj(b) France. In peace France normally maintains 2 &quot; reinforced&quot; Alpine divisions on the Italian frontier. It is calculated, however, that, if the situation elsewhere, especially vis-a-vis Germany, allows, France could concentrate a maximum of 20 divisions and 5 cavalry divisions against Italy within 14 days, leaving the German frontier to be guarded by the 6 &quot;reinforced &quot; divisions normally assigned to that role in peace. After that, the French programme of expansion provides that within 3 weeks of mobilization her first 20 new divisions will be ready to take the field, in addition, subject to the security of her Mediterranean communications, to 2 or 3 composite divisions from North Africa.(c) Yugo-Slavia. In peace Yugo-Slavia maintains an army of 17 divisions (including Guard Division) and 2 cavalry divisions, of which 7 divisions and 1 cavalry division are normally located in the neighbourhood of the Italian and Austrian frontiers, and along the Dalmatian coast. Details of the Yugo-Slav plan for the expansion of her army on mobilization are not at present known, and it is probable that this question has not yet been precisely determined by the Yugo-Slav General Staff. It is believed, however, that the latter aim at the formation on mobilization of from 8 to 16 additional divisions, and that, subject to the necessary material and equipment being available, the whole of these would probably be ready to take the field during the first month of war.(d) From the foregoing paragraphs it will be seen that in comparison with the combined forces of her two potential enemies, Italy, while enjoying the advantage of operating on interior lines, will be in a position of actual numerical inferiority from the outbreak of war, an inferiority which will, moreover, tend to increase as the war progresses.As regards the relative fighting quality of ^the three combatants it may be said that notwithstanding the energy devoted by the Fascist government during recent years to the improvement of the Italian army in equipment, in moral and in general efficiency, its standard in all these respects is still, and is likely to remain for some time to come, far behind that of the French.Compared with Yugo-Slavia on the other hand, the Italian Army is undoubtedly better equipped and probably better trained than that of her eastern neighbour. At the same time the traditional fighting qualities of the Yugo-Slavs would render them formidable adversaries, especially when fighting in defence of their own country, and there is little doubt that man for man they would prove themselves greatly superior to the Italians.4. General conclusions.Assuming that in the initial stages of the war envisaged in the preceding paragraphs Italy will be engaged simultaneously on two fronts, i.e., against France and Yugo-Slavia, it seems reasonable further to assume that her policy on one front at least will be defensive. The choice before Italy appears therefore to lie between : (a) Attack on France combined with defence against Yugo-Slavia ; or,(b) Conversely, attack on Yugo-Slavia and defence against France.Having regard to the relative forces available, and the nature of the terrain in which she would have to conduct her operations on either frontier, the second alternative appears to be the more likely, namely, that Italy will maintain a defensive attitude, in the first instance .at all events, against France in conjunction with a rapid and vigorous offensive against Yugo-Slavia.For the latter operation it is considered that the Italians&apos; main line of invasion into Yugo-Slavia would lie through Slovenia, towards Laibach and Zagreb, wherein Italy may hope to secure the co-operation of Hungary in an enveloping attack on Yugo-Slavia from the north.Further, as a subsidiary operation to be carried out in combination with the above, the activity recently displayed by Italy in the development of communications in Albania indicates at least the possibility that she may contemplate a secondary offensive through that country to invade Serbian Macedonia, with or without the co-operation of Bulgaria.The probable Yugo-Slav counter-action to meet this situation, and. an estimate of the possible direction and extent of Hungarian and/or Bulgarian intervention on the side of Italy are considered in the &quot; Note on the military problems of Yugo-Slavia.&quot;4.

It is unlikely, however, that there is any considerable number of machine guns in reserve, as units have only recently been issued with their full establishment of light machine guns, and have not yet received their full peace establishment of heavy machine guns.It is estimated that there is a minimum of 150 light guns in reserve.(J) Productive capacity and industrial mobilization.There are three major arsenals, four minor arsenals and five powder factories in the Japanese Empire. By working at under half their capacity these establishments fulfil the ordnance requirements in peace ; the plant not in use is available to increase production in emergency.In Japan, industrial mobilization is controlled by the General Mobilization Bureau, which is under the direct control of the Prime Minister. Each Minister of State, in his own sphere, is responsible for making investigations with a view to preparing for industrial mobilization. It is improbable, however, that schemes have yet been drawn up for the turn over of industry from a peace to a war footing.5. Preparations for Chemical Warfare.Japan takes considerable interest in chemical warfare research. There is a laboratory for this purpose near Tokyo. The commandant of it visited Europe in 1929 to investigate the methods of other countries. In the last three years Japan has allocated a total of about  30,000 for expenditure on anti-gas equipment; but units have not yet been equipped with gas masks, except in special cases such as those taking part in manoeuvres.It is reported that during the recent troubles with the aboriginals of Formosa the Japanese troops used tear gas.6.

Note on the Military Phoblems of Japan.1. To maintain her increasing population, Japan is dependent on an unrestricted supply of food and raw material from overseas ; the Japanese navy, therefore, forms the first line of national defence in that country.2. In view of this fact, the strength of the Japanese army may appear, at first sight, to be considerably in excess of the defence requirements of the Japanese Empire. Since 1905, however, Japan has invested considerable sums of capital in South Manchuria, which at the present time amounts to about  200,000,000. This is concerned, chiefly, with the South Manchuria Railway, with its subsidiary iron and coal mines, and the port of Dairen. Japan takes some 70 per cent, of the total export trade of Manchuria, from which she derives a large percentage of her necessary raw materials of iron, coal, oil and the agricultural products of beans and millet. .3. Japan views the U.S.S.R. as a potential enemy. In Manchuria, Japanese and Soviet interests clash, and the possibility is ever present of an ultimate armed conflict between the two countries, though for some years another Russo-Japanese war is improbable. Japan realizes that any relinquishment of her control in Manchuria would result in a corresponding increase in Soviet control. It is for this reason, and in order to protect her Korean frontier against Soviet aggression, that Japan considers her present position in Manchuria to be one of vital importance.4. China, in this generation, can never be a military menace to Japan, but she may become a dangerous rival. Japan, in order to counter economic action by China, might be compelled to resort to arms.5. In any armed conflict on the Asiatic mainland Japan, to defend her interests and gain room to manoeuvre, would undoubtedly occupy positions on an extended front (possibly as much as 600 miles) considerably in advance of her present frontier. To do so effectively a large military force would be essential. In the Russo-Japanese war a total of some 350,000 Japanese bayonets opposed a total of some 446,000 Russian bayonets. A similar situation may arise, and with a modern, and possibly hostile, China on her flank it will readily be seen that Japan would require a large army to defend her interests on the mainland and to safeguard her island empire.6. It is, therefore, primarily for the defence of her frontier on the Asiatic mainland and for the retention of her control in Manchuria, which she believes to be vital both for strategic and economic reasons, that Japan maintains an active army of some 200,000 men.7. Japan has decided in favour of a conscript army, which, in view of financial stringency, she has to maintain at a minimum cost : any reduction in the peace strength of her army would entail a corresponding decrease in the number of her trained reserves for the next 20 years. Taking a long view therefore Japan is unlikely to agree to any drastic reduction in her peace strength.8. Japan is believed to desire peace. Security and industrial development would seem to be her chief considerations. It cannot be overlooked, however, that the existence of large reserves of trained soldiers and an ever increasing population may, some day, lead to the employment of the former as a means of solving the problem of the latter.5.

At the start of a war the nation must be handicapped by the fact that in peace her requirements in weapons and ammunition are furnished by State arsenals, and there is no large private concern engaged upon the manufacture of such material.Recognizing this fact the Government, in 1920, inaugurated a comprehensive scheme of industrial mobilization. This scheme has been accorded willing co-operation by manu-facturers and, on paper at least, appears to have advanced further than that of any other power.Bearing in mind her considerable reserves of war material, it may reasonably be assumed that the U.S.A. will be able to equip her armies as fast as she can train them.5. Preparations for chemical warfare.The TJ.S.A. signed the Geneva Protocol of 1925, but the Senate subsequently refused ratification. It is the declared policy of the Government that the country shall be prepared to take counter-measures in the event of the employment of chemical weapons by her enemies. The Chemical Warfare Service maintains a manufacturing arsenal at Edgewood, a school, and the nucleus of a chemical regiment. Since 1926 approximately  250,000 has been voted annually towards the maintenance of this service.The offensive use of gas is, in fact, taught, and is freely discussed in service journals.There is no strong feeling in the country against chemical weapons, as is proved by the frequency with which they are used by the police in civil disturbances.6.

Note on Military Problems op the U.S.A.National defence, ascribing to that phrase its strictest interpretation, does not present the TJ.S.A. with any serious military problem provided that she controls the sea approaches to her territories. This, in the present international naval situation, she is likely to be able to do, except as regards the Philippine Islands which are practically indefensible but of minor importance. Assuming immunity from sea-borne attack, her soil can only be invaded from Canada. Mexico, or the insignificant Republic of Panama. Many obvious reasons, strategical and political, render an attack from Canada within the future as far as it can be foreseen so improbable as to be negligible. Mexico is not a serious military power, and the defence of that frontier can safely be entrusted to a small garrison.She has, of course, to take into account the possibility of a raiding force, which eludes her navy or inflicts upon it a local reverse.. Moreover, she recognises that the power of her navy, upon which her immunity from attack depends, is proportional to its liberty of action. For these reasons she has spent and is spending enormous sums of money on her coast defences. In the Panama Canal Zone alone there are approximately 60 guns and howitzers of calibres between 6-inch and 16-inch, and this zone is without doubt the most heavily defended area in the world. Hawaii, and the principal harbours in the Continental U.S.A.. are also very heavily defended.Secure from foreign invasion, she maintains a mobile army mainly in order that she may be able to use force in the last resort in support of certain aspects of her foreign policy ; briefly these are : (a) The Monroe Doctrine.It is in these days so unlikely that any European power would attempt to acquire colonies in Latin America that the Monroe Doctrine, as originally conceived, has become an anachronism. More recently, however, the Doctrine has been interpreted by certain American statesmen as implying a right to intervene in any Latin American country where U.S. interests, political or commercial, are menaced.(b) The Caribbean Policy.This is an intensified form, applied to the Central American and Caribbean Republics, of the modern version of the Monroe Doctrine referred to in (a) above. The U.S.A. is determined to regard the whole Caribbean area as constituting for her an exclusive sphere of influence mainly on account of its strategic importance relative to the existing and proposed trans-isthmian canals.(c) U.S. Policy in the Far East.Traditionally, the U.S.A. stands in China for the maintenance of the &quot; Open Door.&quot; Practically she requires to defend, by force if necessary, her important trade interests in China from whatever may threaten them in that constantly changing scene.(d) The Freedom of the Seas.This traditional U.S. policy means in effect freedom for TJ.S. trade, and is one which during a Europeau war will always tend to bring her into conflict with the belligerents. While she will obviously rely mainly upon her navy to act for her in support of this policy, her ability to impose her will must in no small degree be dependent upon her capacity to produce an army. For example, in the last war her reply to the German submarine campaign was the dispatch of the A.B.F. to France.In short, it is true that although the U.S.A. claims to be one of the foremost protagonists of international peace, her military policy is designed mainly with a view to the employment of her armies offensively beyond her borders.For the furtherance of such a policy she is equipped with very powerful resources in man, money and raw materials. Thanks to her geographical position, she can reasonably count upon an ample margin of time in which to mobilize these resources.6. GERMANY.1. (a) Actual peace strength active army.-	Officers.

The semi-military associations, whose existence is contrary to the Treaty of Versailles, are divided into three main classes : (a) Political. Sub-divided into (i) Nationalist, such as ...   Stahlhelm ; National-Socialists; Wehrwolf ; Jung Deutsche-Orden ; other minor associations.(ii) Republican   ...       ...   Reichsbanner Schwartz-Rot-Gold.(iii) Communist  ...       ...   Rot-Front Kampjerbund (officially suppressed but still in being).(b) Non-Political.The Grenzschutz, or frontier defence organization, existing mainly along the eastern frontier, whose object is to check invasion.(c) Sporting Associations.These often carry out military training to a certain extent. The chief are the riding clubs and rifle clubs, some thousands of which exist.2. In addition to the above, there are two classes of associations, which, though ostensibly within the Treaty, yet possess a distinct military value :(a) Associations formed for a special object.(i) Combating of natural catastrophes, the practices for which afford training, forexample, in military engineering, signal work, rapid movements by mechanical transport.(ii) The Technical Emergency Aid Corps for working essential services in times ofemergency.(iii) Railway Protective Corps.(6) Veterans&apos; Associations.There are several hundred of these, representing practically every regiment or corps in the old army. Most of them are comprised within a centralized organization known as the Kyffhauser Bund. Besides these there are officers&apos; and ex-aviators&apos; associations. The younger generation is admitted to membership and receive military instruction.3. Of all the above associations the political are the most numerous, and those Nationalist in character receive indirect assistance from the military authorities, who regard the Stahlhelm in particular as the first reserve for the army. All associations mentioned in paragraph 1 have supplies of small arms and ammunition.* For further details of these Associations tee note below.

As regards unauthorized reserve stocks, there is little doubt that large quantities of rifles, machine guns and small-arm ammunition escaped destruction during the period of control, and that other large quantities of stores were not effectively destroyed. A certain, but, by comparison, very limited number of guns may similarly also have survived. To what extent reserve stocks have since been illegally accumulated, it is impossible to say. The extravagant votes for war material in the annual military budgets, quite apart from open subsidies, are believed to be devoted in the main to preparations for future manufacture, rather than to the formation of very large reserves, the existence and cost of maintenance of which could hardly he concealed.(b) Productive capacity and industrial mobilization.The enthusiasm for modernization and rationalization has caused the capacity of German industry in general to outstrip that of any other continental nation, as also present consumption at home and in foreign markets, particularly in coal, iron, steel, machinery, electrical products and chemicals. Whilst Germany now produces one-third of her requirements in oil fuel, the State controls the majority of the public utility undertakings and the. converted pre-war arsenals, and is continually increasing its participation in the nitrogen, aluminium and other key war industries ; it is estimated that about 15 per cent, of the entire economic activity of the country is now in its hands. In the case of munitions, the policy is to subsidize and to concentrate on research and experiment, mass production being usually relegated to the many armament firms having German connections, which are situated in neighbouring countries.One of the paradoxes of military control by the Allies was that Germany obtained a most thorough insight  into her potential war productive capacity :  thus were the(5635) D4. It is difficult to give an exact estimate of the total number of men in these associations who are of military age and more or less trained, owing to conflicting evidence, a pronounced tendency to exaggeration, and the fact that many persons belong to more than one association. The conservative estimate of 1,500,000, which excludes war ex-service men, is made up as follows : Political associations Stahlhelm    ........................ 400,000National-Socialists..................... 150,000Jung Deutsche-Orden, Wehrwolf, etc.     ...       ...       ...       ... f 0,000Meichsbanner         ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 250,000Communist........................ 100,000Grenzschutz       ......       .................. 100,000Sporting associations    ...      &quot;*       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 150,000Associations with special objects       ...      ...      ...      ...       ... 200,000Veterans&apos; associations (post-war generation) ...       ...       ...       ... 100,000
foundations laid of her plan for future industrial mobilization. Germany was able to develop this plan in the early post-war days. The Federation of German Industries, established in 1919, a; vast concern embracing every branch of industry and commerce, provides an admirable intermediary between the Government and the trade for collecting data regarding raw materials, manufacturing plans and requirements, output capacity and facilities for expansion of any factory.Readiness for production, however, postulates, apart from paper plans and the provision of designs and process specifications, the possession and installation of the necessary jigs, tools, gauges and machinery. It is possible that all this might be provided gradually and secretly. A further delay at least of 4 to 6 months would, however, probably be essential before output could reach the figure required to maintain a force of 21 modern divisions in the field, and secret manufacture up to such a scale for such a period would be extremely difficult to conceal.5. Preparations for chemical warfare.Germany manufactures a quarter of the world&apos;s chemicals and is the largest producer in Europe. The German Dye Trust is the main constituent of Germany&apos;s chemical industry, and many of its ordinary commercial products can be converted into poison gas by simple and rapid methods. It is believed that the Government encourages the manufacture of such chemicals and provides subsidies for research and the necessary conversion plant. There is reliable evidence too, that the German War Office includes a gas inspectorate, supervising gas organization and-training in offensive and defensive measures, and a technical branch which collaborates with laboratories in state institutes, universities and private firms. The offensive use of gas in war is almost certainly intended. All these activities are forbidden by the Peace Treaty.6.

Military problems.The Treaty of Versailles gave Germany an army of 100,000 men without reserves or facilities for rapid expansion. Her war industry was crippled and all measures for mobilization-tion were prohibited. Furthermore, the area west of the Rhine, and within 50 kilometrea east of it, was completely demilitarized, and any attempted violation of this demilitarized-zone was to be regarded as a hostile act. In the event, therefore, of war against the western powers, Germany must overcome these obstacles and must place a force at, a sufficiently early date west of the Rhine, adequate to protect the vital industrial area of Westphalia, until the national reserves are mobilized.At Locarno Germany, France and Belgium recognized the permanency of Germany&apos;s present western frontier, for the maintenance of which Great Britain and Italy stood as guarantors. Germany and her neighbours on the west and on the east agreed to settle all disputes by peaceful means,, but Germany did not recognize, the pennanency of her eastern frontier. Lastly, France concluded defensive alliances with. Poland and Czechoslovakia. The consequence of Locarno is that any aggressive act by Germany on the east or on the west must result in a, European war.In the face of these treaties Germany remains comparatively powerless, isolated and aloof, and her military policy is not a menace to peace. She, looks rather to diplomacy to emancipate her from the more irksome restrictions of the Versailles Treaty. Her present cry is for immediate disarrxuunent, and she professes to be profoundly disappointed with the results so far achieved.Meanwhile Germany is forming her army into a highly trained cadre and, wherever possible, is secretly removing her military disabilities; she intends gradually to resurrect her former military strength, so that, when a future crisis arises, she will at least have something with which to bargain.

Preparations for Chemical Warfare.. Chemical warfare is deeply studied in all its aspects. Chemical units, equipped mainly with offensive appliances, form part of the regular army. Experiments are being carried out in spraying gas from tanks and aircraft. Training in defensive warfare is carried out systematically, and the army is equipped with an efficient gas mask manufactured in Soviet Russia. The organization of the training, and of the protection, of the civil population is undertaken by a patriotic society.(6535) d 37. U.S.S.R.1. (a) Actual peace strength active army.

General co?isiderations.The leaders of Soviet Russia to-day openly delare their belief that war is sooner or later inevitable. They further state that war will come from an attack on their western frontiers ; whether they believe this or not, they are preparing feverishly for the eventuality of war.Three areas are possible theatres of war if Soviet Russia were the aggressor the Far East, Central Asia and the western frontier. Manchuria and Central Asia present certain disadvantages, both from the distance of both these fronts from the main centres of supply and the inadequacy of the communications. Russia has, however, shown in the recent clash with China as regards the Chinese Eastern Railway that she is by no means disinterested in the Far East. An advance into Afghanistan would be accompanied by serious practical difficulties, but the Soviet Government cannot be blind to the great blow which it would deal to our prestige and to the dangerous situation it would create for us in India. Russia is the one declared enemy of the British Empire in the world, and we must expect her to lose no opportunity of striking a blow at our position in India, our most vulnerable spot, when the moment suits her. While it is probably true to say that she is preparing primarily for a war upon her western frontiers, we cannot afford to ignore the possibibty, or indeed the probability eventually, of aggressive action in Afghanistan or even in Persia. The situation on the western frontier of Russia has been dealt with in the main appreciation of the general situation in Europe, and it is sufficient here to say that Russia&apos;s military preparations in Europe are directed primarily against Poland and Roumania.Poland is regarded by Russia as one of the main bulwarks against the spread of communism and a successful attack on Roumania at least offers the chance of regaining the lost province of Bessarabia. There are 27 infantry and 16 cavalry divisions of the Red Army in the frontier districts facing Poland and Roumania, and these could be supported immediately by some 16 of the remaining infantry divisions of the Red Army which are stationed in the western portions of Soviet Russia.Soviet Russia might embark on a war of aggression as the first act in the accomplishment of world revolution or as a last desperate gamble to save the Soviet regime. The main essentials are that such a war should be popular and that a rapid decision could be expected. These conditions would be most likely to be fulfilled in the case of a war with Poland and Roumania, and it is against these two countries that Soviet Russia&apos;s military preparations in Europe are primarily directed,Man-power in Soviet Russia is unlimited. On the other hand the power to equip and arm that man-power is, and will be for some years, limited. Military industry to-day is still in its infancy, the army is ill-equipped with modern technical weapons, and the capacity of Soviet Russia to supply those weapons from her own sources is as yet insufficiently developed. Transport services are over-strained and badly disorganized, railways are few and good roads even scarcer. The army, although improving steadily, is less efficient than that of the other major Powers. Although its moral might be high, if it were fighting in defence of Russian soil, if is doubtful how well it would fight if launched on an offensive campaign outside its frontiers. The military preparations of Soviet Russia aim at removing the obvious weaknesses disclosed by the above considerations.2. Soviet Russia^ Military Policy. In view of the above considerations, the main principles, on which the military policy of Soviet Russia to-day is.based, are    .   .(i) The rapid development of all forms of industry, civil and military, sufficient to make herentirely self-supporting in event of war.(ii) The development and reorganization of road and railway transport.(hi) The preparation of an army, capable of rapid mobilization and expansion, which shall be equipped with a high percentage of modern offensive weapons.(iv) The concentration of a large part of this army in peace time close to the Polish and roumanian frontiers.(v) The inculcation in the whole nation from youth upwards of the militaristic spirit, and ofthe belief in the dangers threatening both Russia and communism from across the frontiers. &apos;

Conclusion.Inview of the avowed object to bring about world revolution, Soviet Russia must inevitably represent the greatest threat to the peace of the world. Such a danger is, however, more likely to be precipitated by intense propaganda and gradually increasing economic pressure, than by the threat of immediate armed intervention, because the industrial situation of the country, and the backward state of communications, limit the likelihood, for the moment, of offensive operations on any large scale beyond the frontiers of Soviet Russia.
Number of machine guns, tanks and armoured cars unknown. The Czech war industries are executing large foreign orders and may be expected, therefore, to have large numbers of machine guns, some artillery, and possibly armoured fighting vehicles on hand, which could be appropriated by the Czechoslovak army on mobilization.(b) Productive capacity and industrial mobilization.The war industries in Czechoslovakia are of primary importance ; they are feeling the effects of trade depression less than any other, and the Government owns large interests in them. Their productive capacity is more than sufficient to meet the Czechoslovak require-ments on mobilization, and Czechoslovakia is in effect the arsenal of the Little Entente.Industrial mobilization appears to have received considerable attention. Where feasible war material factories have been removed from strategically unfavourable areas and set up elsewhere. All the leading munition firms are supervised by military control committees and the rationalization of the Czechoslovak war industries is believed to be complete.5. Preparations for chemical warfare.A thorough study of anti-gas defence, both for the army and for the civil population, is being made; a Military Chemical Institute and an Army Gas School are maintained. There is also ample reason for believing that Czechoslovakia is studying the offensive use of gas, but that the policy is to accumulate only small stocks of gas ammunition in peace, as the military authorities consider that the chemical industries are sufficiently productive and well organized to meet all requirements shortly after the outbreak of war6.

Czechoslovakia did not exist.* All figures are converted at the present rate of exchange.Note on the Militauy Problems of Czechoslovakia.Czechoslovakia has two main military problems, the German and the Hungarian, aggravated by the minority problems in the country.(i) Germany. Czechoslovakia^ most formidable neighbour is Germany.    Bohemia and western Moravia, in which the majority of Czechoslovak industries are concentrated, form a large salient sharing, on the north-east, north and west, a common frontier of over 400 miles with Germany. To a large extent the problem of defence is facilitated by the mountain ranges by which the frontier is demarcated, though the German minority population is mainly to be found in Northern Bohemia.   In the.....eolith, the frontier is contiguous for  about  200 miles with Austria :  hither to the Czechs have had no fears in this respect, since they regard Austria as a peace-loving nation, but they regard the proposed German-A ustrian Customs Union as a grave menace since, if it led ultimately to the Anschluss, this southern frontier, which presents the easiest line of advance into the industrial heart of Czechoslovakia, would in all probability be open to German invasion in war. But it must be remembered that at Locarno Czechoslovakia and France concluded a treaty, guaranteeing each other mutual armed assistance to provide against unprovoked aggression by Germany as a result of any failure on her part to observe the terms of the other Locarno treaties afFecting France and Czechoslovakia.(ii) Hungary. The most important feature of this problem is that in the provinces ofSlovakia and Ruthenia, a large proportion of the population on the Hungarian frontier is more favourably disposed to the latter than to Czechoslovakia. East of the Danube these provinces are particularly exposed to a Hungarian invasion or coup de main and it is believed that in case of war, in which the attitude of Germany was uncertain, Czechoslovakia would abandon Ruthenia and Eastern Slovakia. At the same time, it must be remembered that Hungary&apos;s military forces are limited by the Peace Treaty to a strength of 35,000 (little more than one-quarter of the maximum peace strength of the Czechoslovak army), with no heavy artillery, tanks or aircraft, and that Hungary is practically surrounded by the Little Enteute, the members of which are bound to each other, not only by treaties of alliance, but also, it is believed, by definite secret military pacts providing for mutual assistance in case of Hungarian aggression. By herself, therefore, Hungary does not constitute a serious menace to Czechoslovak security, though she would doubtless endeavour to turn to her advantage any general conflagration in Central Europe.

Note on the Military Problems op Yugo-Slavia.1. Yugo-Slavia&apos;s chief military preoccupation is the danger of attack by Italy with the ^possible co-operation of Hungary and Bulgaria. Italian policy has been, consistently hostile to Yugo-Slavia mainly on account of the latter*s alliance with France, and in furtherance of this policy Italy has cultivated close political and military relations with Hungary and Bulgaria both countries which have lost territory to Yugo-Slavia for the ultimate restoration of which they look hopefully to a revision of the peace treaties. Albania, another neighbour of Yugo-Slavia is to all intents and purposes an Italian protectorate.2. Independently of the larger Italian danger there is the constant possibility that Yugo-Slavia may become embroiled with Bulgaria as a result of the activities of the Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization in Macedonia ; but should that occur, in a clear single issue with Bulgaria, the greatly superior strength and organization of the Yugo-Slav army should ensure a rapid and decisive success for Yugo-Slavia.3. Yugo-Slavia&apos;s land frontiers, except the Hungarian, are mainly mountainous and can be crossed by large forces only along certain well-defined and narrow routes which offer great natural facilities for defence. An enemy landing on the Dalmatian coast would also find great difficulty in penetrating inland through the mountain barrier.4. In preparing their plan of campaign for a possible war against Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary, the Yugo-Slav General Staff can no doubt count upon some measure of assistance against Hungary from Czecho-Slovakia and Roumania, their Little Entente allies, whilst Roumania might in addition neutralize a part at least of the Bulgarian Army. Italy would also he compelled to retain fairly strong forces for the protection of her French frontier against a possible French offensive.5. It is known that the Yugo-Slav General Staff expect attack hy the Italian armies not only across the common frontier and from the north through Austria and/or Hungary, but also through Albanian territory against southern Serbia. The forces at the disposal of Italy for these operations would probably be about 19 divisions on the outbreak of war and this number might be increased during the first month by the addition of about 20 reserve divisions, the exact number depending on the scale of Italy&apos;s requirements on the French frontier. The Bulgarian and Hungarian armies are limited by treaty to peace strengths of 20,000 and 35,000 respectively. Provided equipment is available, however, Bulgaria and Hungary could probably each put 8 to 10 divisions in the field soon after the outbreak of war.6. In peace the Yugo-Slav army consists of 17 divisions and 2 cavalry divisions. Six divisions and 1 cavalry division are located in Southern Serbia near the Bulgarian and Albanian frontiers; 7 divisions and 1 cavalry division are in the neighbourhood of the Italian and Austrian frontiers and in Dalmatia, and the remaining 4 are centrally placed near the Hungarian frontier and in the vicinity of Belgrade. On mobilization it is believed that a maximum of 16 additional divisions will be formed, and more are probably contemplated in the future as additional war material becomes available. As the result of considerable purchases of armament in recent years the Yugo-Slav army is now fairly well equipped and both officers and men are first-class fighting material. Aided therefore by the difficult nature of the country in which it would be called upon to fight, the Yugo-Slav army should have little difficulty in holding its own in the initial stages of the defensive campaign envisaged in the preceding paragraphs.7. Until relations with Italy improve there is little likelihood that Yugo-Slavia will be prepared to reduce her armed forces. On the contrary, she would no doubt feel more secure if she were able to mobilize larger forces on the outbreak of war. Yugo-Slavia herself has nothing to gain ,by ,war and..would probably go to considerable lengths politically in order to maintain pea&amp;efi*/A%ttohgj!SY^ig6-Slavia may consequently be regarded as one of the best guarantees for stability5 in &apos;the&apos;Ballftras:iiflM a tao&apos;aihb&amp; cl v   wjiio ditio hi white bsci&quot;. dn at B9SAS suoiiav10.

This ^object has not yet been attained, but considerable progress has been made, particularly as regards the production of light artillery, rifles and ammunition. No medium or heavy artillery has yet been manufactured in Poland.Nothing is yet known of plans for industrial mobilization.5. Preparations for chemical warfare.Particular regard is paid to the study of this subject by the Polish General Staff in view of its conviction that the U.S.S.R. proposes to use this method of warfare extensively when occasion arises.A Military Gas School is maintained for training the army. In addition, a Military Anti-Gas Institute has &apos;been established &quot;Where experiments are carried oat in both offensive and defensive -methods or chemical warfare. these include trials erf various gases in shells, &quot;projectors and aeroplame bomfbs.A semi-military organization also exists for training the civil population in means of gas defence.6.

Note on the Military Problems of Poland. 1. Geographical Situation. Poland&apos;s geographical situation is such as to complicate her military problem.   The extensive land frontiers in the north, east and west present few obstacles to military operations on a large scale, except in the area of the Pripet marshes.   From the strategic point of view the country is not well adapted for defence.2. Political Considerations. The present political situation of Poland as regards her neighbours intensifies the difficulties inherent in her territorial situation, as she is faced with potential enemies on all sides except in the south.(a) U.S.S.R. As the result of years of oppression prior to the Great War, the Polishattitude to Russia is traditionally hostile. It has not changed since the establishment of the Soviet regime, owing to the Bolshevik war of 1920, and to the intense propaganda which the Soviet Government now directs against Poland as the enemy of communism. Soviet attempts to foster revolution in Polish Ukraine are an additional factor straining the relations between the two countries.The Polish Government is fully alive to the efforts now being made to increase the efficiency of the Red Army, particularly in the air and in chemical warfare, but is aware of the limitations imposed on its offensive operations by the bad state of the Russian railways and transport services.(b) Germany. The recent improvement in German-Polish relations cannot alter the factthat a fundamental and concrete basis for dissension between them is always present, i.e., the Polish Corridor. This improvement can therefore only be regarded as the establishment of a modus vivc?idi which benefits both parties, but which evades the main issue. The Poles fully realize that the Germans have never resigned them-selves to the loss of this territory, and never will do so.(c) : Lithuania.--Poland&apos;s problem of facing both Germany and the U.S.S.R. is aggravated by her situation vis-a-vis Lithuania, which country has never recognized Polish sovereignty over Vilna. The Poles are convinced that Lithuania will endeavour to regain this territory, should occasion arise, by acting in co-operation with Germany or the U.S.S.R.3. External assistance for Poland.The Polish-Roumanian Treaty of Alliance is primarily intended to ensure mutual support in the event of aggression by the U.S.S.R. The Poles, although placing no great reliance on Roumania&apos;s ability to resist a Russian invasion, are confident that they themselves would be able to hold up and eventually to defeat the Red Army. They do not count on receiving active support from Estonia or Latvia, whose situation would be precarious, ouing to their exposed position, if they intervened before the Red Army was beaten in the field.Against Germany, Poland still relies on France to hold the bulk of the German forces and on that basis feels confident that she herself can deal with the remainder. She does clearly recognize, however, that Germany is potentially her more dangerous opponent, but an opponent who is not yet strong enough to resort to armed force.4. Armed Forces of Poland.In 3time;: of&apos;:pea&quot;ce 30 divisions are maintained, which would be increased to 40 within three months of the outbreak of war. Poland&apos;s ultimate intention is to put 60 divisions into the field,&apos;but&apos; she is limited to 40 at present by her lack of reserves of war material. This position is only slowly being rectified.5. Conclusion.The military problem with which Poland is faced is therefore a difficult one. She does not anticipate war in the near future, and should it come, feels confident of her ultimate success with the aid of France in the case of Germany, and to a less degree of Roumania against the U.S-S.R. She does foresee, however, that some day she may be called upon to fight on two fronts, with Germany possibly once more a powerful military nation.   This constitutes her gravest problem.11.

At the end of the war, Roumania found herself possessed of considerable accessions of territory gained at the expense of three of her neighbours-Russia, Hungary; and Bulgaria. There is Tittle doubt that, given a favourable opportunity, these countries would endeavour to regain what they have lost^ and Roumariia&apos;s military problem is to ensure against such a contingency. baosd h2. Her Bulgarian frontier is, for the greater part of its length, protected by the River Danube, but her-.Hungarian frontier possesses no natural defences, whilst the River Dneister, which divides Bessarabia from the territories of the U.S.S.R., is not a serious military obstacle.,     (A) 1914.

3. Fortunately for Roumania, two of her potential enemies Bulgaria and Hungary-are relatively disarmed, whilst any danger from the latter is further provided against by the Little Entente Treaties. Thus Roumania is unlikely to require large forces for the protection of these two frontiers except in the event of a general European conflagration, when treaties have been torn up, and Bulgaria and Hungary provided with the war material they lack by their allies among the great powers. In such circumstances both these countries could put formidable armies in the field with personnel superior in fighting value to the less virile Roumanians. This possibility the Roumanian G.S. have to bear in mind when planning the defence of their country against the far more present danger on their Russian frontier.4. The U.S.S.R. has never acquiesced in Roumanians possession of Bessarabia and the Roumanians are convinced that the U.S.S.R. intends, when the time is ripe, to attempt to recover that province either by fomenting internal revolution or by force of arms. Evidence of Roumanian fears on this account is furnished year by year when &quot; war scares &quot; gain currency in Bucharest, arousing invariably a degree of anxiety which argues little self-confidence on the part of the Roumanian General Staff.5. In peace the Roumanian Army consists of 23 divisions and 4 cavalry divisions : 6 divisions and 1 cavalry division are located in Transylvania facing Hungary, 6 divisions and 2 cavalry divisions are in or nt*ar Bessarabia facing Russia, whilst 9 divisions and 1 cavalry division in the old Kingdom together with 2 divisions in the Transylvanian Alps are available to reinforce the Russian front and to Watch Bulgaria. On mobilization it is believed that 7 additional divisions are to be formed making a total of 30 divisions and 4 cavalry divisions. Allowing 13 or 14 divisions and 2 cavalry divisions to form a central reserve and to cover the Hungarian and Bulgarian frontiers, this would enable Roumania to concentrate 17 or 16 divisions and 2 cavalry divisions on the Russian front. Against these the U.S.S.R. could bring into the field greatly-superior forces subject only to the limitation imposed by the capacity of her railways to maintain them. It is therefore probable that the Roumanian General Staff would decide to evacuate Bessarabia with its undeveloped communications at the outset, and would endeavour to make a stand On the line of the River Pruth.6. The Roumanian army does not inspire confidence as a fighting force. Its armament and equipment are heterogeneous and inadequate, its standard of training is indifferent and the quality of its officers is generally poor. It is, therefore, probable that any serious Russian offensive against Roumania alone would Hot only overrun Bessarabia but would overcome whatever resistance were offered on the Pruth and penetrate beyond into the heart of Roumania.7. As long as Roumania believes, rightly or wrongly, that Russia constitutes a potential and even an imminent menace to her security, there is little possibility that she will consider any reduction in the strength of her army. In fact, but for the pressure of financial stringency, the Roumanian government would no doubt substantially increase its military expenditure in order to provide the new war material which is urgently required to render the army a more effective instrument of defence.
