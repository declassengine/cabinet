Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The recent case of Mrs.  Olive Kathleen Wise has drawn attention to the present law in respect of the trial on a capital charge of a woman about to become a mother.        Under the existing law,  it is open to a, woman who has been tried on a capital charge,   convicted and sentenced to death,   to allege in stay of execution that she is quick with child, thereupon the Court orders the empanelling of a jury of twelve matrons and,  if they find that she is in fact quick with child, sentence of death is respited by the Court.It has been strongly represented that the existing lav/ should be altered so as to prevent a. pregnant woman going through the ordeal of having sentence of death passed upon her.      Its passing is only a form since it is nowadays hardly thinkable that a woman pregnant with a quick child whose sentence has been respited by the Court would be kept in prison until the birth, of the child and thereafter have sentence executed upon her.      The sentence is invariably commuted at. once by exercise of the Royal Prerogative.      As a result of the Wise case there is undoubtedly a considerable public feeling that some alteration of the law is desirable so as to avoid the necessity of the sentence of death, being passed.A Bill on this Subject was introduced by Miss Picton-Turbervill under the 10 minutes&apos;  rule on the 4th February and obtained a First Reading by acclamation.      The Bill,  although it had not then been printed,   obtained a Second Reading on the 17th February after 11 c*.&apos; clock and was pommitted to Standing Committee A.      At this stage Miss Picton-Turbervill consulted
me as to the lines on which her Bill should be drawn. I myself had been contemplating asking the Cabinet for authority to introduce a Bill on the same subject and had been in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice, who expressed to me his concurrence in the view that legislation should be introduced to effect the proposed alteration of the law.      I had accordingly instructed Parliamentary Counsel to prepare a Bill on lines generally approved by the Lord Chief Justice;    and when the Bill was received I handed it to Miss Picton-Turbervill and informed her that the Government would be prepared to support a Bill on these lines.     Miss Picton-Turbervill has adopted the Bill as her own,  and it has now been circulated in her name.The main provisions of the Bill are that where a woman convicted of an offence punishable with death is found,  in accordance with the provisions of the Bill,  to be pregnant, the sentence to be passed on her shall be a sentence of penal servitude for life instead of sentence of death;    the Bill further provides that the question whether the woman is pregnant or not shall be determined by the trial jury on such medical and other evidence as may be laid before them,  either on the part of the woman or on the part of the Crown.      The procedure under the existing law, whereby sentence of death is passed and the woman then alleges in stay of execution that she is quick with child, and the reference of the question of pregnancy to a jury of matrons for ^determination are both abolished by the provisions of the -dill.It will be seen that the Bill would effect a humane and necessary reform in procedure under the criminal lav/.      It is not controversial since no one can object to the reform which the Bill proposes to effect;    indeed it is evident from the public interest in the case of Mrs. Wise,  that legislation on the lines of the Bill will command very general support
9 no.. . iji the Bill,  however, has at present 13 Bills in front of it in Committee and there is little likelihood of its making any progress this Session unless special facilities are given.      I am &quot;being pressed by the women1 s organisations, who are strongly supporting the Bill,  to give it facilities, and 1 would suggest,  for the consideration of my colleagues, that the Bill should now be taken over as a Government measure.      This would ensure its early passage through Committee and I  should hope that the Report and Third Reading Stages would occupy little,  if any, of the time of the House. The Chiefs/hip,  whom I have  consulted,   sees no difficulty in the way of this course.J . it. C.5th Farch,  1931
