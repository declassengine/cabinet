-a- if Othis document. is the property of his britannic majbsty&apos;s government..CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    g3CP. 84 (31).WE circulate herewith the report of our visit to Paris and Rome in connexion Avith the outstanding questions of the London Naval Conference.A. H. A. V. A.1. At a meeting with the Prime Minister on the evening of Wednesday, the 19th February, to consider the position reached by Mr. Craigie in his conversations with M. Massigli in regard to the questions left outstanding by the Naval Conference as between France and Italy in regard to naval armaments, it was agreed that Mr. Craigie should proceed to Paris and Rome to explain that if the Erench and Italian Governments could reach agreement on the basis of the latest figures discussed between Mr. Craigie and M. Massigli, His Majesty&apos;s Government would take note of that agreement. Though, for their part, they could not accept the figures now proposed, they would be prepared to notify the ether Powers signatory of Part III of the London Treaty that they would not have recourse to article 21 of the London Treaty-pending the meeting of the General Disarmament Conference, when the whole question would be reviewed.2. Mr. Craigie returned to Paris on the following day, only to find that the French Government were not disposed to allow him to negotiate in Rome on the conditions contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The view of the French Government was that the figures which had been under discussion with Mr. Craigie were only acceptable to the French Government on the condition that they would form part of a definite agreement on the naval question between France and ourselves, and that, if this condition could not be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the French Government would feel compelled to revert to their programme as regards tonnage figures and withdraw the figures offered by M. Massigli to Mr. Craigie.3. The situation created by the report from Mr. Craigie was considered at a meeting at No. 10, Downing Street, on Sunday evening, the 22nd February, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, at which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty were present. It was agreed at that meeting that only one course was open to meet the contingency which had arisen, namely, that Mr. Henderson and the First Lord should proceed to Paris for the purpose of further elucidating the position, and, if possible, reaching an agreement.4. They left for Paris on the following morning, accompanied by Mr. Craigie, Commander Bittleston and Mr. Selby.First Conversations in Paris.5&quot;. On their arrival in Paris they were at once driven to the Quai d&apos;Orsay, where M. Briand v\ as awaiting them, accompanied by M. Charles Dumont, Minister of Marine, and the Erench experts who were concerned with the negotiations.5797   [5133] b
6. Mr. Henderson suggested to M. Briand that perhaps the best course would be that Mr. Alexander and M. C. Dumont should retire with the experts for the purpose Of discussing the question of figures, while he and M. Briand would remain together to review the general position. M. Briand at once accepted this suggestion and Mr. Alexander and M. Charles Dumont proceeded to another room.7. Mr. Henderson explained to M. Briand that he had been perturbed by the reception given by the French Government to the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government which Mr. Craigie had been instructed to convey on the preceding Thursday. So anxious had His Majesty&apos;s Government been to remove any possibility of misunderstanding that Mr. Alexander and he had come to Paris with the express approval of the Prime Minister to explain the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government.8. Mr. Henderson told M. Briand that from the communications which had been received in London, His Majesty&apos;s Government had gained the impression that the French Government thought they had rejected in toto the proposals which M. Massigli and Mr. Craigie had discussed. This was not the case. Though His Majesty&apos;s Government could not see their way to accept those proposals as part of the London Naval Treaty for the reason that their effect would be to raise the levels which it was the object of the London Treaty to stabilise for all the Powers concerned, they had been so anxious to find a way round the difficulty that they had declared themselves willing, if the solution proved acceptable to the Italian Government, to consult the other Powers, parties to the London Treaty, with a view to securing their acceptance of the agreement without raising the question of article 21 of the treaty. Mr. Henderson emphasised to M. Briand the great importance he attached to seeing a solution of this long-outstanding question, and expressed the hope that in view of their collaboration, to which he attached so much importance, M. Briand would exert all his efforts to assist in bringing about a satisfactory settlement. Mr. Henderson told M. Briand that if they could come to an agreement in Paris it was the intention of the First Lord and himself to proceed to Rome for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain the agreement of the Italian Government.9. M. Briand said he much appreciated the reasons which had prompted the visit. He was most anxious to do all he could to assist, but said that he had already exercised much influence on his naval authorities to achieve the conces-sions which had been made by the French Government. He expressed himself as entirely in favour of the idea of the visit to Rome if agreement could be reached in Paris.10. M. Briand and Mr. Henderson agreed to meet again as soon as any result emerged from the discussions on figures which were proceeding between the First Lord and M. Charles Dumont and the respective experts. These discussions lasted throughout the evening of Monday, and occupied the morning of Tuesday.11. In setting forth the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the First Lord took as a basis the last French proposals, and drew attention to the points on which they were unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as follows: Capital Ships.12. He could only agree to the proposed increase in the French and Italian tonnage with great reluctance. It was true that the increase was small (6,000 tons) and that it would give rise to no new construction, but would only permit France to retain an existing capital ship which it was anxious not to scrap at present. Nevertheless, the principle was bad, and His Majesty&apos;s Government could only agree to this as a temporary expedient (because no other way round the difficulty of France&apos;s capital ship ratio to Italy could be found) and as being subject to the general scaling down of capital ship tonnages which we hoped to secure in 1932, or at the latest in 1935.13. Another point of great concern to HisMajesty&apos;s Government was the report from Mr. Craigie that the French Minister of Marine proposed to mount a 13-inch gun on their new battle cruisers. While recognising that they had no locus standi for objecting to this under existing treaties, Mr. Alexander explained how the general&apos;adoption of the 13-inch gun (following on the French lead) would operate to prevent that drastic reduction in the existing maximum
displacement of the capital ship (35,000 tons) which all were agreed to be essential. He made an earnest appeal to the French Minister of Marine to reconsider this point.Q-inch Gun Cruisers and Destroyers.14. The First Lord said that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been much con-cerned to learn of the latest French proposal to keep such a large proportion of their overage tonnage in this category, and asked whether some 35,000 tons of this overage could not be kept in the capital ship category, as had originally been proposed. He strongly pressed for a revision of the position in this category because the proposal to keep 41,000 tons in overage produced a total figure which His Majesty&apos;s Government could in no circumstances accept as a permanency and would be most reluctant to admit even up to 1936. Mr. Alexander made it perfectly clear that we considered the retention of this tonnage conferred no claim whatever on France to its ultimate replacement by new tonnage.Submarines.15. Mr. Alexander next submitted that the figure of 83,148 tons of French submarines for 1936 was altogether too high when compared with the London Treaty figure of 52,700 tons and with our destroyer figure of 150,000 tons. The lowest figure on which France could rest in 1936 without scrapping underage tonnage built and building was 77,500 tons, and, whilst this was much too high, His Majesty&apos;s Government would temporarily undertake not to invoke article 21 of the London Naval Treaty in respect of this figure on the understanding that the whole question would come under review at the General Disarmament Conference next year. It would have to be clearly understood that, in the event of that conference failing to reach a more satisfactory solution from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, their right of increasing their destroyer tonnage under article 21 must be fully reserved.16. A long discussion ensued, in the course of which M. Charles Dumont declared that the French capital-ship gun of 13 inches was based on the necessity of having an overwhelming superiority over the new German Ersatz Preussen type of capital ship (11-inch gun); that it was quite impossible for France to accept any modification of its proposals for overage in the 6-inch gun and destroyer category and that these proposals must be considered in relation to the great sacrifices made by France in the 8-inch cruiser category; and that public opinion in France and in the Chamber would drive from power at once any Minister of Marine who accepted at the present moment any submarine figure lower than 80,000 tons.17. Finally, it was decided,, on these particular points, to recommend a provisional agreement as follows:  (1) Capital Ships.France would reduce the calibre of the gun on its projected capital ships from 13 inches to 12 inches, if Italy would do the same, on the understanding that His Majesty&apos;s Government, would give the French a written assurance that they them-selves favoured a gun of a maximum calibre of 12 inches and a reduction in the existing maximum displacement of 35,000 tons. .It was also agreed that the proposed increase of 6,000 tons in capital ship tonnage was to be effected without prejudice to a subsequent general revision of the tonnages established by the Treaty of Washington.(2) 6-mc/i Gun Cruisers and Destroyers.As it was found quite impossible to move the French on the figures for this category, it was agreed that the arrangement proposed by the French Government, under which they would be able to keep in this category a larger proportion of their overage tonnage than had been suggested in earlier schemes, should be[5133] b 2
allowed to stand, subject to the following general reservation which had been suggested in the earlier conversations between M. Massigli and Mr. Craigie: &apos;&apos; It is understood that the present agreement establishes no permanent ratio in any category of ship as between the British Commonwealth of Nations, France and Italy, and that, in particular, no precedent is being created for the final solution of the question whether, and if so in what manner, tonnage remaining overage on the 31st December, 1936, may ultimately be replaced.&quot;(3) Submarines.France will not, between now and 1936, increase her existing underage tonnage of 81,989 tons of vessels built and building; actually France will not include any submarines in its 1931 programme and will not lay down any more submarine tonnage before 1933 a point which will be made clear in a letter which the French Minister of Marine is to address to his Italian colleague: the submarine question will be reviewed at the 1932 Conference when the whole naval question comes up again for re-examination; to take account of the contingency that a more satisfactory solution of the submarine problem may not prove possible in 1932 and that France may rest on her figure of 81,989 tons, it is understood that the British Commonwealth of Nations right to increase destroyer tonnage under article 21 of the London Naval Treaty must be fully reserved.18, Italy to be asked similarly to agree not to increase between now and 1936 her underage submarine tonnage (for vessels now built and building) of 47,390 tons, and to include no provision for submarine construction in its 1931 and 1932 programmes.19. An agreement (Annex I) embodying these principles was duly prepared and was submitted for approval at a meetim;&apos; held at the British Embassy at which Mr. Henderson and Mr. Alexander and M. Briand and M. Charles Dumont were present. This agreement was accepted as a suitable basis for the settlement of outstanding differences on the question of tonnage as between Great Britain and France.20. Mr. Henderson informed M. Briand that it was the intention of Mr. Alexander and himself to proceed forthwith to Rome to secure the adhesion of the Italian Government to the new scheme. Should they be successful the other Governments parties to the London Treaty would be approached with a view to their acceptance of the scheme as meeting the requirements of the situation as between ourselves, France and Italy, without involving recourse to article 21 of the London Treaty, pending the discussions which would take place at the General Disarmament Conference in the spring of next year.21. It was agreed that the new plan must receive the approval of the respective Governments, but M. Briand made it clear he did not regard it as necessary for the British Ministers to defer their departure for Rome on that account. He anticipated no difficulty as regards the approval of the French Council of Ministers.Conversations in Rome.22. Mr. ITenderson and the First Lord left Paris on the evening of the 24th instant, arriving in Rome the following evening..23. It was at once made clear by Sir R. Graham on their arrival that everything would depend on the attitude of Signor Mussolini to the proposals under discussion and that it was of vital importance that Mr. Henderson and the First Lord should be received by Signor Mussolini, who was anticipating their visit.
24. In the meantime the Ambassador had arranged a meeting with Signor Grandi on the following morning. This meeting took place at 11 o&apos;clock on Thursday, the 26th instant. Signor Grandi was accompanied by Admiral SiriannC Minister of Marine, and the Italian experts. Mr. Henderson suggested to Signor Grandi that they might follow the same procedure as&quot; had been followed in Paris, namely, that the First Lord and Minister of Marine, accompanied by the experts, should discuss the question&apos; of figures while he and Signor Grandi would deal with the general political position. Signor Grandi agreed to this course.25. Mr. Henderson then proceeded to give Signor Grandi a full account of the discussions which had taken place in Paris, and asked him to use his influence with his Government to assist in arriving at a settlement. Signor Grandi expressed his appreciation of the efforts which had been made in Paris. Though emphasising his own difficulties, he said he was as anxious as were His Maiesty&apos;s Ministers to find a solution, and would render all the assistance in his power.26. In the meantime the technical issues formed the subject of lengthy delibera-tion between the First Lord and the Italian Minister of Marine, assisted by their respective technical advisers.27. The points of difference between the plan which had been provisionally agreed upon at Paris, and the maximum which the Italian Government had shown a disposition to accept during Mr. Craigie&apos;s visit to Rome in December, were the following: (1) Reduction of Italy&apos;s submarine tonnage from 52,700 tons to 47,390 tons, i.e., a reduction of 5,310 tons. (This figure of 47,390 tons represents Italy&apos;s underage tonnage built and building to-day, and corresponds to the figure of 81,980 tons of French underage submarines built and building.)(2) Acceptance for both France and Italy ox an increase of 6,000 tons in the maximum figure of 175,000 of capital ships allocated to them under the Washington Treaty, thus enabling France to avoid scrapping, before 1936, an overage capital ship which it is anxious to keep. (By this means the existing proportion between French and Italian capital ships subject to the Washington Treaty would be retained.)(3) Acceptance of the French proposal whereby existing overage tonnage in the 8-inch cruiser category may be scrapped and considered as replacement, tonnage for new construction in the 6-inch-gun cruiser and destroyer category. This provision would enable 6-inch-gun cruisers and destroyers to be retained, within the agreed limits, as they became overage, in the place of older vessels in the 8-inch-gun category.(4) Acceptance of a sixteen-year life for Italian destroyers in place of the life of twelve years which, under the London Naval Treaty, may be given to destroyers completed before the 31st December, 1922. The purpose of this provision was to postpone the completion of 8,021 tons of Italian destroyers until after the 31st December, 193G, and so prevent the Italian figure of new construction under the agreement being slightly higher than the French figure.  :28. Great difficulty was met with in securing the assent of the Italian repre-sentatives to these amendments of the plan accepted by the Italian Government last December, and particularly to those relating to the reduction in the -submarines and to the sixteen-year life for destroyers (points (1) and (4) above). The Italian objection to the proposed reduction in their submarine tonnage was mainly political, since Italy would have to stand in a category apart, with the British Commonwealth of Nations, the United States and Japan on a &quot; parity &quot; figure some 5,000 tons higher and France at a still higher level. Cm the morning of the 27th February agreement was reached on this question by our undertaking to recommend to the French Government a solution under which Italy would be allowed to bring her figure up to the 52,700 tons mentioned in Part III of the London Treaty by retaining 5,310 tons of overage, non-replaceable tonnage. An analogous suggestion had been rejected by the Italian Government when it was proposed to them by Mr. Craigie last December, and their acceptance of. it on the present occasion was a proof of their keen desire: to meet us in every way possible. -
29. Admiral Sirianni also accepted in the course of the morning all the other proposals made to him, with the exception of that relating to a sixteen-year life for destroyers (point (4)). Here a question of principle and prestige was involved, for the Italian Government attached great importance to securing a construction programme, for the period of the treaty, which would be at least equal to that of France, thus demonstrating Italy&apos;s steady advance towards parity even during the course of the proposed agreement. To the French, however, any idea of the equalisation of construction figures was quite unacceptable, seeing that to maintain their existing lead in underage ships up to the 31st December, 1936, France would have to build approximately 24,000 tons more than Italy, whereas under the proposal we had brought from Paris the French Government had agreed to be content with a lead in construction of some 7,000 tons only. This was, however, their minimum.30. The First Lord pressed Admiral Sirianni strongly on this point during the whole of the 27th February, and finally expressed his readiness, if this would secure agreement, to join in a tripartite declaration under which the British Commonwealth of Nations, France and Italy would all agree not to replace destroyers under sixteen years of age. Even this proposal failed, at first, to secure agreement, although Admiral Sirianni and his advisers seemed disposed to regard it as a reasonable compromise. It became evident that the opposition centred in Signor Grandi, who finally agreed, at the end of a long day&apos;s discussion, to lay the whole matter before Signor Mussolini for final decision. Thus by the evening of the 27th the points of difference had been reduced to very narrow limits, but no final agreement had actually been reached.31. In the meantime, in the course of the afternoon of the 26th, Mr. Flenderson and the First Lord had visited Signor Mussolini. Signor Mussolini received them most cordially, and made no concealment of his gratification at their visit. Mr. Henderson told Signor Mussolini that His Majesty&apos;s Government attached so much importance to a settlement of this long out-standing question that he and Mr. Alexander had come in person to Rome. Mr. Henderson took pains to set forth to Signor Mussolini at some length the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government desired to pursue as regards disarmament in general and his hopes of the Disarmament Conference. He further emphasised the vital importance which His Majesty&apos;s Government attached to co-operation with Italy, pointing out that, after all, the exigencies of our geographical position made action independently of one another a practical impossibility. It was for all these reasons that he was so anxious for a settlement of the question which they had come specially to Rome to discuss, and he added that he felt convinced Signor Mussolini would use his great influence in assisting in the achievement of the desired object. Signor Mussolini showed himself quite obviously deeply interested in the statement Mr. Flenderson had made to him, signifying his approval at repeated intervals as Mr. Henderson proceeded. Signor Mussolini later proceeded to interrogate the First Lord closely on the detailed figures. On the conclusion of the interview Signor Mussolini gave his assurance that his willing co-operation might be counted on, although he emphasised the difficulties which his own Government had to surmount, having regard to the state of their public opinion.32. The following evening (the 27th February), Signor Mussolini dined at the Embassy. Immediately on his arrival he informed Mr. Henderson and the First Lord that he had accepted their proposals as regards the one outstanding point remaining for consideration as a result of the discussions between the First Lord and Admiral Sirianni, subject to the formula which the First Lord had proposed. Fie made it clear that his action was dictated solely by his desire to show his appreciation of the visit paid to Rome, and his wish to consolidate the relations between Italy and Great Britain. Signor Mussolini said he hoped his attitude would be appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and enquired whether it was likely that the French Government would now be satisfied. Mr. Henderson thanked Signor Mussolini warmly for the manner in which he had met the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and said that, although the settlement which had been reached involved slight modifications in the plan agreed upon in Paris, he had every reason to think that the First Lord and he would be able to persuade the French Government to accent. In any case, they were both entirely satisfied with the arrangement and would so inform the French Government.33. Anxious to exploit the undoubtedly advantageous atmosphere which bad been created by the visit to Rome, it was thought that it would be desirable that
an immediate announcement should be made, of the agreement between the three Powers. Accordingly, Mr. Craigie was instructed to get into touch with M. Massigli by telephone, with a view to explaining to the French Government the position now reached and the amendments agreed upon with the Italian Government to the document to which the French Government had given their approval in Paris. Unfortunately, the French Government did not see their way to agree to a statement being issued in Rome signifying their final endorse-ment of the amendments agreed with the Italian Government. M. Massigli made it clear, however, that he considered his Government would be generally satisfied with what had been achieved, although they must reserve their final decision until the new figures had been explained. In these circumstances it was considered that an announcement could be made before leaving Rome to the effect that agreement had been reached in principle, subject to the approval of the other Governments concerned.Second Conversations in Paris.34. Mr. Henderson and the First Lord left Rome on Saturday, the 28th February, arriving in Paris on the following afternoon. On their arrival at the Gare de Lyon they found M. Briand and M. Charles Dumont awaiting them. They were at once driven to the Quai d&apos;Orsay.35. Mr. Henderson gave M. Briand a full account of the discussions in Rome, and said that he was anxious to be able to announce as soon as possible that agree-ment had been reached, as he felt that if any delay occurred in doing this, mischief makers would get to work and spoil the undoubtedly favourable atmosphere which had been created as a result of the discussions which had taken place in the course of the past week. M. Briand expressed himself in entire agreement with this view. He suggested that the First Lord and the Minister of Marine, with their respective experts, should at once set to work with a view to explaining the results which had emerged as a result of the discussions in Rome. In the meantime, M. Briand said that he would like, on behalf of himself and his colleague, M. Charles Dumont, to express his warm appreciation of the notable progress which had been achieved.  He was much gratified by what had been done in so short a time.36. An exchange of views between the First Lord and M. Charles Dumont then took place. At the end of one hour and a half they were able to announce that complete agreement had been reached between them on the modifications which had been discussed and agreed by us with the Italian Government.37. A joint telegram from M. Briand and Mr. Henderson recording this result was at once despatched to Signor Grandi in the following terms : &quot; We are happy to inform you that we find ourselves in entire agreement with you on the arrangement negotiated in Rome for the settlement of the - questions relating to the limitation of naval armament left outstanding by the Treaty of London. We are ready forthwith to recommend this arrangement for the approval of our Governments and of the other interested Governments.&quot; We desire in particular to express our deep appreciation of the friendship and the conciliatory spirit which the Italian Government have shown throughout the course of this negotiation, and especially during the , latest discussions in Rome, where the Italian Government so loyally exerted themselves to reconcile the divergent points of view.&quot; We are convinced that the agreement reached between the representa-tives of our three countries will greatly assist the progress of the work for the consolidation of peace on which we are engaged. It is our sincere desire to leave no stone unturned, in the interest of this work, to take advantage of the atmosphere of confidence, and friendship resulting from the happy outcome, on which we may jointly congratulate ourselves.&quot;We take this opportunity of renewing to you our cordial sentiments and conveying our best -wishes for you and your country.&quot;
B.f: 38. It was agreed with M. Briand that no details of the arrangement should be made public pending the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and of the other Powers parties to the London Treaty.39. It is of importance to record the real spirit of goodwill shown on all hands to assist in bringing about an agreement. In this matter it would be invidious to make any distinction as between Paris and Rome. It is unquestionable that M. Briand exerted all his great influence to further the task in hand, while on the Italian side Signor Mussolini&apos;s intervention decided the satisfactory issue of the discussions in Rome. Signor Mussolini placed it beyond all possibility of doubt that he had taken his decision out of regard in particular to the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to the policy His Majesty&apos;s Government were pursuing for the general consolidation of peace in Europe. In both Paris and Rome the greatest possible assistance was received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in those capitals, Lord Tyrrell and Sir Ronald Graham.Conclusion.40. The statistical position under the proposed agreement is set forth in Annex III. In summarising the effects of the proposed arrangement it will be convenient to consider the Anglo-French naval problem separately from the Franco-Italian problem.Anglo-French Problem.41. So far as capital ships are concerned, the reduction in the calibre of French guns from 13-inch to 12-inch is extremely satisfactory, for it will smooth the path for a general reduction of the maximum displacement of a capital ship (35,000 tons) laid down by the Treaty of Washington. The increase of 6,000 tons accorded to France and Italy is less satisfactory, but it will give rise to no new construction during the period of the agreement, and is to be effected without prejudice to the general scaling down of capital ship tonnages which it is hoped to secure at the 1932 and 1935 conferences.42. The reduction of France&apos;s 8-inch-gun-cruiser strength from the figure of ten ships, with which France entered the London Naval Conference, to the present figure of seven ships, is also very satisfactory, and was only secured after a long struggle. The figure of seven ships may, indeed, be compared with France&apos;s ultimate goal of twelve 8-inch-gun cruisers of 10,000 tons displacement under the &quot; Statut naval,&quot; for the French authorities realise that they will now never be able to exceed the figure of seven.43. The position in the Q-inch-gun cruiser and destroyer category is not what we should have wanted, on account of the large overage tonnage which France will be able to keep in this category for the period of the agreement. On the other hand, it should te rememtered that Erance&apos;s overage tonnage in the 8-inch-gun cruiser category will be correspondingly reduced, and that, in any event, the proposed general declaration in section B (e), prevents an)&apos; weakening in the position we have always taken up, that the retention of overage tonnage creates no right to, or precedent for, its ultimate conversion into underage tonnage.44. The least satisfactory part of the agreement, from our point of view, is that relating to the submarine category. It proved quite impossible to reduce the French figure below their present tonnage of underage vessels built and building, namely, 81,989, which is far too high when compared with our treaty figure of 150,000 tons for destroyers. We could not have accepted this figure had it not been that the whole question is to be reviewed at the General Disarmament Conference in 1932. In the meantime our right to increase our destroyer figure under article 21 of the London Naval Treaty will be held in reserve in case it should not prove possible to secure a satisfactory settlement in 1932.45: There is also this further consideration : the French Ministry of Marine do not propose to lay down any further submarines until 1933, although there had been, before our agreement, provision in the 1931 and 1932 programmes for a large increase in France&apos;s submarine tonnage.   Any provision made in the 1932
programme for construction in 1933 (within the limits of the agreement) will now be subject to any decision reached by the 1932 Conference for a further reduction in submarine tonnages.40. In estimating the effects of this agreement it should be borne in mind that the French entered the London Naval Conference with a demand for a submarine figure of nearly 100,000 tons and that France&apos;s ultimate goal under the &apos;&apos; Statut Naval&quot; had been 125,000 tons of submarines.Franco-Italian Problem.- 47: The main purpose of these long negotiations has been to reproduce in 1930 approximately the same relative position between France and Italy as that which exists at present, while leaving the question of principle (i.e., &quot;parity&quot;) in abeyance. The Italian Government showed themselves disposed to consider a settlement on these lines in the later stages of the conversations which have taken place, provided that a solution could be found which would not involve the insertion into the resulting agreement of any figures showing a definite inferiority of Italy to France. It is for this reason that a form of words has been adopted: for the regulation of French and Italian construction, which, as shown in Annex II, section B, contains no statistics. The actual effect of the agreement, however, is that the existing French margin of superiority over Italy will be reduced from 244,000 tons to 229,000 tons in 1936. France&apos;s position, relative to Italy, in underage cruisers, destroyers and submarines will be slightly improved, and France would be able to construct some 7,000 tons more than Italy of ships to be completed in 1936; but, despite this result, Italy will, by 1986, have approached a little closer to &quot;parity.&quot; The actual amount of tonnage to be constructed during the whole period 1931 to 1936 will be greatly diminished, as compared with what would have occurred had there been no agreement; for France would then have been free to build the approximate tonnage of 50,000 tons a year necessary to complete her &quot;Statut Naval&quot; programme, instead of the 28,000 tons a year which is all that she will be able to build in the six years ending the 31st December, 1936. It may be confidently assumed that, had there been no agreement, Italy&apos;s construction programmes would have followed the French construction programmes ton by ton.48. So much for the technical aspect of the question. On the political side, the results which may be expected from the proposed settlement are still more impressive. We ourselves are spared the prospect of a naval competition with France which might have done much to prejudice our relations, and would have done nothing to improve the chances of a yet more satisfactory settlement at the General Disarmament Conference in 1932. Between France and Italy a detente is already noticeable, and Signor Mussolini, Signor Grandi, M. Briand and M, Charles Dumont, one and all, expressed their firm intention of leaving no stone unturned in an effort to use the naval settlement as a means of eliminating outstanding political differences between their two countries and generally bringing about an improvement in their relations.49. Steps are being taken to secure the assent to the proposed agreement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions and of the Governments of the United States and Japan. It has been made clear throughout that our acceptance of these proposals must be subject to the concurrence of all the Governments parties to the Treaty of London.[5133]
