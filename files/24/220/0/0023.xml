his document 13 the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government. Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1931.SECRET..P. 73 (31).CABINET.TIN RESTRICTION SCHEME : PROPOSED TIN POOL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. THE Cabinet, on the 18th February, approved in principle a scheme for the regulation of the production and export of tin. The details are now being worked out, and I hope within a few days to inform my colleagues of the progress which has been made.2. It is unnecessary to recall that the purpose of this scheme is to secure an equilibrium between production and consumption, with the view of preventing rapid and severe oscillations of price. It is now suggested that the restoration of such equilibrium, and a desirable rise in price above the present figure (which is considerably below the estimated average cost of production) will be more readily obtained if it is possible to remove from the market the very large stocks (estimated at over 50,000 tons) which have now accumulated. On the basis of the present restriction scheme and assuming no increase in consumption, it would take about 4 years before the visible stocks would be reduced from that figure to about 20,000 tons, which, may be taken as the normal amount. Until these stocks are materially decreased, producers may not receive that rise in price which would compensate them for the restriction in production.3. One device for this purpose is the formation of a pool to remove stocks from the market and hold them until prices have reached a given level, after which they would gradually be liquidated according to an agreed plan. The outline of such a scheme has been laid before me, by the Dutch delegates on the International Tin Restriction Committee. Briefly, it is proposed that an Inter-national Syndicate should be formed which would, with the least possible delay, take a minimum of 20,000 tons off the market. The tin would either be bought up as it came on the market, or it would be put into the pool by existing holders of stocks (e.g., the Dutch Government Banka concern, which is understood to hold over 3,000 tons in Amsterdam), or supplies as they came forward would be withheld from the market. As regards sales by the pool, the present tentative proposal is that the Syndicate would release up to 5 per cent: or 10 per cent, of the pool for sale each month when the price of tin reached  160 a ton; should the price reach  180, 20 per cent, a month would be released&quot;.4. It is clear that this scheme can only be worked if the Netherlands East Indies Government agrees to come in, and I understand that they would not come into the pool unless they know that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no objection to it. If the scheme is not objected to by the Cabinet, it might be left to the Federated Malay States and Nigerian Governments to join it or not, as they choose; but, in view of the element of risk inseparable from such an arrangement, and the difficult financial position in Nigeria, I should strongly discourage the Nigerian Government from participating and in any case the Anglo-Oriental Mining Corporation, and their associates, are I understand ready to provide the Nigerian quota in the pool. The Malayan Government has had previous experience of Governmental purchases of tin in times of crisis : in 1914, at the outbreak of the war; in 1919, when they bought 5,780 tons and sold out at a profit of  108,716; and from 1920-21, when they bought 9,858 tons[5220]Copy No.5
at an excessive price, and, after holding their stocks and gradually selling them over a period of 4 years, lost about  300,000 (allowing for loss of interest on money locked up).5. The proposal will, no doubt, be criticised by those who object to any Government interference with industry or production. It will be said that the Governments have combined to restrict production and export, thereby rendering possible the formation of a pool to force up the price of tin, and that they now propose to make money out of the situation they have created. On the other hand, it may be urged that the pool will be a necessary, or at least desirable, machinery for hastening the attainment of the object of the restriction scheme which His Majesty&apos;s Government have already approved; and that it is a reasonable, and natural, extension of that scheme. The supplies held by the pool will be declared, and shown in the weekly &quot;visible stock&quot; statistics. These supplies will be released, according to a pre-determined scale, as soon as the price rises to a figure which is close to the estimated average cost of production. The immediate effect of the pool should be to smooth out the practicable difficulties involved in restriction; to diminish the opposition of producers to the introduction and continuance of that scheme; and to secure the object which that scheme aims at more rapidly and more certainly than would otherwise be possible.6. I have ascertained that, if the pool is formed, and irrespective of the question whether the Governments of Malaya and Nigeria participate or not, the International Tin Restriction Committee will at all times be kept fully informed, by the pool, of its current policy, and of its position and operations.7. I have set out fully the advantages claimed for this scheme of a &quot;Pool&quot;; but I am not prepared to recommend the participation of the Nigerian and Malayan Governments in what is simply a speculation in tin. Such a speculation is none the more justified in that the Governments concerned will be able to influence the relaxation of the restriction of production or an increase in its stringency, according as the price rises or falls. If it were put to me as a private individual, I could only reply that it would be repugnant to me to be concerned in a gamble in which I could myself influence the factors determining the profit -or loss, at the expense of others outside the combination.8. Such a gamble by the Colonial Governments is not a necessary corollary of the regulation of production and export. The deliberate planning of produc-tion in correspondence with the world&apos;s demand is, to my mind, a legitimate substitution of order for anarchy. It is inevitable, in such a planning, that holders of stocks should benefit by any rise in price that results. But this does not involve approval of other people, not holders of stocks, deliberately buying tin in the hope of selling it again at the profit that is expected.9. In this case it is not the associated tin producers who will determine the degree of stringency of restriction of production, but the Governments concerned. This may be a reason why, wuthin the limits of ordinary capitalist morality, it may be open to the tin producers to try to increase their profits by pooling their stocks, and by collectively determining the price at which they will sell. But it seems to me a conclusive reason why the Governments who have to decide from time to time the stringency of the restriction should not deliberately make them-selves speculative holders of tin.10. The Nigerian Government cannot afford to speculate, even on an assumed certainty (which, however, never is certain !). The Malayan Government has accumulated surpluses (which are now being seriously drawn upon). The question is whether we should let the Malayan Government decide for itself. On the whole, I am in favour of declining to participate in the gamble, whilst saying to the promoters of the &quot;pool &quot; that His Majesty&apos;s Government prefers to express no opinion as to the action in the matter of private owners of tin.P.Colonial Office, March 19, 1931.
