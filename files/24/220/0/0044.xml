THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.a o q... tjPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1931.SECRET.Copy No.5C.P. 94 (31).CABINET.FUTURE AIRSHIP POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.eitherips h roved0 data 1- ^ a memoranClUin (CP. 93(31)) circulated a few days Sure, nor^aehieved since, I drew attention to the main features of the report of the tne0essr 101 &apos;Tn \riry Court of Inquiry into the loss of the R. 101; that document throws leaves the whole&quot; issue little or no light on what our future airship policy should be and of their future still Would indeed have been rather outside the province of the Court to make any recommendations under this head. I pointed out, however, that it might fairly be claimed, in the light of the Courts findings, that the R. 101 disaster was not due to any inherent and ineradicable defect under which airships as such inevitably labour. In short, it cannot be said that airships have proved a failure any more than it can be claimed that they have achieved success.The object of the present memorandum is to submit to my colleagues definite proposals as regards future airship policy.I had originally contemplated that it would be necessary for me to ask for the appointment of a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet to investigate the somewhat complex and difficult questions involved, but the deliberations of the Air Council have so far cleared the ground that I think I can present the main issues requiring decision in comparatively brief compass and clear-cut form.2. It may be convenient if I first outline (a) the programme to which the Air Ministry has been working since 1924, (b) the cost of that programme to date, and (c) the extent to wdiich it has been completed and the present position.Summary of the 1924 programme as subse-quently modified and amplified after the Imperial Conference of 1925 : Main features (1) the construction of two huge new airships, (2) the creation and equip-ment of bases at Car-&apos; clingum, Ismailia,Karachi and Montreal, (3) meteorological in-investigation of the Indian route on which it was intended to in-augurato a period of experimental opera-tion.(a) The 1924 programme.The essentials of the -1924 programme, as subsequently amplified after the Imperial Conference of 1926 were an elaborate scheme of research and experiment with an existing airship (the R. 33); the construction thereafter of two large new rigid airships of a capacity of 5,000,000 cubic feet, one to be built by private enterprise and one by the Royal Airship Works; the expansion of Cardington as an airship base by the provision of a mooring tower (a device of British invention) and a new shed, in addition to the enlargement of the shed already in existence there; the erection of mooring towers with their appurtenances at Ismailia in Egypt and at Karachi, and, in addition, a shed at the latter base; the development of further mooring tower bases in the Dominions, so far as these latter were willing to shoulder the cost (in the event
Canada alone constructed such a base, though South Africa earmarked a site); and an elaborate meteorological investigation of the conditions prevailing on the Indian route, on which it was decided to concentrate operations in the first instance.Such, somewhat compressed and telescoped-for new require-ments were added from time to time to the original plan-was the programme still in course of execution last October, when the R. 101 started on her ill-fated flight to India. The ultimate objective in view was the operation of a regular, though experimental, service over a period of months, whereby it was hoped to solve once and for all the vexed question of the airship&apos;s potentialities as a means of transport, and accumulate working data which, if the experiment proved a success, would suffice to enable the future development of airship services to proceed on normal commercial lines of course with the assistance for some time to come of a State subsidy.(b) Its cost to date.Expenditure on the above programme to date h a s been  2,350,000. This ex-dudes expenditure by the Dominions and India.Expenditure on the programme to date has been approxi-mately  2,350,000 Canada having defrayed the cost of the mooring tower base at Montreal and India the cost of the mooring tower, but not (save for certain minor items) that of the shed, at Karachi.* This sum is largely in excess of the original estimated cost, viz.,  1,350,000, but the excess has been primarily due to the fact that the programme has taken several years longer to complete than was originally envisaged. In this connection I should point out that when the original estimate of  1,350,000 was furnished  as an approximation at very short notice it was expressly stated that it was provisional and allowed no margin whatever for unforeseen delays.The present position : (1) One airship (R. 100; remains with captain and crew and a nucleus of technical staff; (2) The bases above de-tailed have all been completed.(c) The extent to which it has been completed and the present position.The scheme of research and experiment was carried through to a successful conclusion, making available a vast mass of new scientific data which has profoundly influenced airship design. The R. 100 and R. 101 were completed, if at a much later date than originally contemplated; and although perfor-mance more particularly in respect of carrying capacity did not come up to estimates, and led, in the case of R. 101,. to the insertion of an extra bay, there is no doubt that both vessels represented an engineering achievement of which the country may well be proud, and a remarkable advance on any airships hitherto built in Great Britain. The R. 101 in November 1929 confounded her critics by riding out easily at the mast at Cardington a series of gales, in the course of which the wind veered as much as 1350 in one minute and attained a maximum gust velocity of 83 m.p.h.; the R. 100 crossed and recrossed the x-itlantic to Montreal and back in July 1930. All the works at home and overseas summarized in (a) above have been completed; and the charting of the Indian route meteorologically has resulted in the collection and tabulation of full data in regard to the weather conditions likely to be encountered between England and India at all seasons* Of this amount the two airships cost approximately  1,000,000 the R. 101  570,000, plus  75,000 for the extra bay subsequently inserted and other modifications, and the R.100  357,000. Tho constructors of the latter vessel claim to have lost  200,000 on the contract. The other main items were (1) enlargement of an existing and construction of a new shed at Cardington  22;!,000 ; (2) shed at Karachi  186,000 ; (3) mooring tower at Cardington  50,000 and mooring lower base, with gas plant, &amp;c, at Ismailia  93,000.
Tlio position abroad: iFrance and Italj&apos; have ! temporarily  abandoned : airship       development though France retains a     nucleus      airship orga nisation; theTJ.s.A. and Germany have active forward policies, particularly the former, which has approved a programme entailing  2,500,000 of capital expenditure.The successful record of the Graf Zeppelin.of the year data which should prove of the greatest value from the point of view of aeroplanes no less than airships.In the disaster to the R. 101, however, perished almost all the leading airship experts in the employ of the Air Ministry, including the vessels designer. We are left accordingly with the barest nucleus of staff, and with only one airship though I ought to point out that the loss by accident of one of the new ships was a possibility envisaged throughout, and was indeed a governing consideration in the original decision to build two airships. Lastly, the R. 100 cannot be flown further without a complete refit  a point to which I shall return later and, as at present advised, I think her operations should be confined to training and experimental flights, unless she is enlarged by the insertion of a new bay, which J am not jmepared to recommend.3. Clearly a decision as to future policy is a weighty matter requiring very careful consideration. I think, therefore, that before taking such a decision my colleagues will wish to have before them information as to the view taken by other great Powers on the future of airships and the policy these Powrers are at present pursuing in regard to their development.Briefly, the position is as follows : France and Italy have, for the time being at all events, decided to abandon the develop-ment of airships, though France continues to maintain a nucleus airship personnel which operates three small semi-rigids, the largest of which has a capacity of 311.000 cubic feet! Their decisions to do so wrere taken respectively after the accidents to the &quot; Dixmude&apos;&apos; and the &quot;Italia.&quot; I may remind my colleagues that the &quot;Dixmude&quot; was a German vessel surrendered to France in 1920; she was constructed for war purposes, i.e., to attain a very high ceiling, and accordingly her structure weight was exceptionally light. I shall deal further with the circumstances of her loss later in this memorandum. The &quot; Italia &quot; met her fate whilst engaged in Arctic exploration. There &quot;were therefore exceptional features about both accidents. The U.S.A. and Germany, however, are both pursuing an active forward policy, undeterred by past accidents. The U.S.A. already maintain one large rigid airship (the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;), and a number of small vessels of various types, including one of 200,000 cubic feet capacity with an all-metal instead of a fabric outer cover. A further giant vessel of a capacity of 6,500,000 cubic feet is nearing completion. Construction of a second sister ship has been authorised, if the first proves a success, the contract price for the two vessels and the hangar in which they are to be built being approximately  1,600,000. The development of bases and their appurtenances, such as mobile mooring towers, is also being vigorously pursued. In particular, it has just been decided to construct a base on the Pacific coast, and ah expenditure of  850,000 has now been definitely authorised to this end. In sum the U.S.A. is engaged on a programme, the approved cost of which for capital services alone (i.e., excluding maintenance charges for the existing ships) is approximately  2,500,000.Germany, which already possesses the Graf Zepj)elin (4,000,000 cubic feet), is about to commence construction of a new vessel of 7,000,000 cubic feet capacity. I attach as an Appendix a table summarising the principal flights made to date by the Graf Zeppelin. It will be seen that between September 1928 and the end of November 1930 this airship made no less than 159 flights, lasting all but 2,400 hours, and covering a total of nearly 150,000 miles the longest non-stop flight having been from Friedrichs-hafen to Tokio, almost 7,000 miles, on which occasion 20 passengers were carried in addition to her crew. Fare-paying passengers were carried on a large number of flights (see last column of Appendix).
All existing (and future) U.SA. airships are to use helium not hydrogen; and helium will be the lifting medium for the new German vessel, which it is also proposed to equip with heavy oilThere are broadly three alternatives open to us: (11 a negative policy, i.e., the aban-clonment of all airship development; (2) a po-sitive forward policy like that of the u.s.a. and Germany, i.c, a further programme of new construction; and (3) a middle course, which can be styled the policy of the &quot; watch-mg brief.&quot; This last is recommended.Outline of this policy.Under this policy there will be no new construction or exten-sive modification of the It. 100, but Cardington and the overseas bases will be kept in being.4. What then should our own policy be? Shall we, as some critics would have us do, determine on wholly inadequate data that there is no future for airships, and ruthlessly scrap the R. 100 the Royal Airship Works and plant at Cardington and our bases in Egypt and India fruits of so large an expenditure of time, enterprise, inventive ingenuity and engineering skill? Or shall we, like Germany and the U.SA., boldly go forward with a policy of further active development including the construction of one or more new vessels whether independently or under some scheme of international co-operation? These clearly are the two opposite poles of future policy, the negative and the positive.5. After prolonged and anxious consideration with my advisers, I have decided to recommend to the Cabinet a middle course which I may perhaps term the policy of the &quot; watching brief.&quot; In my judgment the strict merits of the case point to this course; and it seems to me also to have the advantage of being the course it is most easy to justify to Parliament and public opinion, without exposing ourselves to charges of &quot; defeatism &quot; on the one hand or undue optimism on the other. I need not trouble my colleagues with all the detailed considerations involved, but will only say that, in reaching this decision, I have been influenced above all things by the paramount difficulty of finance. In the present stringency I do not feel I can recommend any policy which will entail more than a relatively modest expenditure, unless and until developments in the U.S.A. and Germany have not only proved conclusively that the airship is technically a practicable proposition in the sense that it can be operated regularly in all conditions of weather, but also indicated that it has a commercial future. Another important factor has been the loss of so many of our foremost airship experts with the R. 101. The policy of the &quot; watching brief,&quot; which I advocate, amounts shortly to this--that we incur for the present no new commitments, but closely observe progress in those countries which are still pursuing airship development, holding ourselves free, on the one hand, to formulate a new programme, if definite success is achieved abroad, or, on the other, finally&apos; to abandon airships in the event of failure. This jDolicy should hold for a maximum period of 3 or 4 years, by when results of experience with the new American and German airships should be available. But even avithin the policy of the &quot; watching brief&quot; there is scope for arariation, as I shall presently explain. Meantime, the acceptance of such a policy renders possible the elimination of several important questions which would otherwise need to be canvassed, and it may be convenient to dismiss these before proceeding to examine such issues as still call for decision.6. Accordingly, as a sequel to adoption of the policy of the &quot;watching brief,&quot; I make the following definite recommenda-tions : (a) That there shall for the next few years at all events be nofurther programme of neav construction.(b) That a new bay shall not (as had been contemplated) beinserted in the R. 100.(c) That Cardington and the Royal Airship Works shallnot be disposed of.(d) That the bases overseas at Ismailia and Karachi shall also be retained and kept in being on the most economical &quot; care and maintenance &quot; basis possible.
Eq ii ally various pro-proposals, such as that for e development of a obile mooring tower, ill not be proceeded . ith on financial  rounds. But the Ht. 100 will undergo a efit and then be re-laced in commission, t is not proposed, again n financial grounds, to se helium, but to con-&apos;nue with hydrogen, f helium is thought to e a sine qua, non the . 100 should be crapped.7. I remarked above that there was scope for variation within the policy of the &quot;watching brief.&quot; It has, for example, been suggested that we should proceed to develop a mobile mooring tower with what are known as &apos;: aerodrome rails &apos;&apos; and &quot;handling rails&quot; devices intended to facilitate taking an airship into and out of her shed by mechanical means as part of our contribution to future development. A contract (had actually been placed for the construction of a mobile tower on these lines at the time of the disaster to the R. 101, but was then suspended. Such a tower with its appurtenances would cost some  60,000. I am not prepared in present circumstances to recommend this expenditure.But the wain question to b\e decided is what shall be done with the R. 100, and in consequence with the staff at the Royal Airship Works at Cardington. I must emphasise, in the first place, that this vessel is (unlike the R. 101) operated by petrol engines, which has hitherto been held to unfit her for flights in the tropics owing to the inflammable character of hydrogen, which constitutes her lifting medium. Here let me say at once that, if helium be regarded as a sine qua non for future airship operation in order to eliminate, so far as humanly possible, the risk of fire, I must reluctantly recommend that the R. 100 be scrapped forth-with and the Royal Airship Works placed, like the bases overseas, on a minimum &quot;care and maintenance &quot; basis. For to operate the R. 100 with helium would entail a minimum capital outlay of  100,000 on plant, &amp;c.; and a subsequent minimum recurrent annual charge of about the same amount* over and above all other expenditure and this,&apos; in present times, I am definitely not prepared to advocate. The vessel&apos;s &quot; lift &quot; would also, of course, be adversely affected.On the other hand, is helium a sine qua non at this stage for training and experimental flights with the R. 100, despite her petrol engines? The report on the R. 101 disaster does not, as it well might have done, make any recommendation as regards the use of helium for future airship operation. Admittedly the Americans and Germans intend to use helium and not hydrogen in future, though the Graf Zeppelin will continue to utilise hydrogen. But, as stated in paragraph 2 (c) above, the R. 100, if refitted, should not, in my own and my advisers&apos; opinion, be utilised except for relatively short training and experimental flights. With some hesitation I have reached the conclusion that the risk of flights of this character with a hydrogen-filled airship is one which on the whole we are justified in taking. I am led to this conclusion by the following two considerations :  (1) In the first place, though there have been several cases of fire in small non-rigids, there has been no case of the destruction of a large rigid airship by fire under peace conditions prior to the R. 101 disaster, with two exceptions of doubtful importance, viz., the R. 38, the front portion of which caught fire after the ship broke in two in the air, and the French (ex-German) &quot; Dixmude,&quot; whose fate must be a matter of specula-tion, as she came down in the Mediterranean out of sight of land, there were no survivors and only a few negligible fragments of wreckage were discovered, though the French official theory was that she was struck by lightning. It must be borne in mind, however, that U.S.A. rigid airships have throughout used helium and not hydrogen.* Both these estimates are highly provisional. Helium would have to be obtained from the U.S.A.,and there would be many attendant difficulties, e.g., the gas-would require to be transported in high-pressure cylinders of large size, for the conveyance of which by rail special rolliug-stock would probably be needed.
An endeavour will further be made to attach British airship officers to the XJ.S.A. and Germany; and a very small nucleus of technical staff will be maintained in this country. Total cost of both the foregoing is estimated at  5,000 to  6,000 per annum.The unemployment aspect: if the ii. 100 is refitted the present staff of 380 can be re-tained, and indeed the number employed will rise temporarily to 450. If she is scrapped, all the staff except 48 will have to be discharged.(2) Secondly, I attach some importance to the lengthy series of successful flights carried out by the Germans with the Graf Zeppelin, a hydrogen-filled airship (see paragraph 3 above and Appendix).Here my colleagues will naturally enquire &quot; Is it worth while to refit and recommission the R. 100 for such limited operations.&quot; In my opinion it is, for the reason that only so can a trained crew (officers and other ranks) be retained in being, and the highly skilled art of airship navigation kept alive.   And I should like to add in this connection that perhaps the principal factor in the remarkable success which has attended the operations of the Graf Zeppelin has been the long practical experience of her crew under every sort and condition of weather.   It seems to me it would be a great pity, before a final verdict is passed on the possibilities of the airship in the light of experience in the U.S.A. and Germany, to allow the last of our trained airship personnel (pilots, crew and such technical experts as remain) to be dispersed. If at some future date it is decided that a fresh programme of airship development is justified, we shall in any event start with a grave handicap vis-a-vis the Americans and the Germans.   If we have not even a nucleus of trained personnel, and, moreover, no airship on which to give training, the handicap will be so heavy, that it will. take us years to overcome, unless it proves possible to organise future airship development on a basis of international co-operation.    Another important factor in this connection is the very heavy expenditure which would be entailed in reopening Cardington, once the Royal Airship Works have been put on a care and maintenance basis.   This is exemplified by our experience in 1924 under the present programme.I may add -that it is my intention, if the policy of the &quot; watching brief&quot; is approved in one form or another, to endeavour to arrange for the attachment of one British airship officer in the U.S.A. and another in Germany (annual cost about  3,000). It is impossible to say whether such a proposal will be acceptable to the airship authorities in the countries concerned &apos; though the extent of our contribution to airship development, both technical and financial, has received general recognition abroad. It is, however, beyond doubt that, if the R. 100 is refitted and we thus show the world that, though marking time, we have not finally jettisoned airships, there is much greater likelihood of our being able to arrange for the desired attachments. Otherwise we have virtually nothing with which to &quot; bargain &quot; except that we can offer facilities at Cardington for occasional flights by American or German airships a gesture on our part which might facilitate a future scheme of international co-operation in airship development.I also contemplate the maintenance at Cardington and /or the Air Ministry of a small technical staff (annual cost  2,000 to  3,000) to collate and study the reports received from the attached officers and generally keep abreast of technical progress in the design, construction and operation of airships abroad.8. At this point I had better perhaps diverge briefly to deal with another important aspect of the question though it is one which I personally do not think should be decisive and that is the question of employment at Cardington.Last October, when the disaster to the R. 101 occurred, there was a total of approximately 860 employees at the Royal Airship Works. To-day that figure has been reduced to approximately 380, though I should add that a small number of those discharged were already under notice prior to the R. 101 disaster. If the R. 100 is to be refitted, it will be possible to find useful employment for 450 until about midsummer 1932, and thereafter for the present figure of 380 so long as the R. 100 is kept in commission.
The financial aspect: (a) to refit and recom-mission the R. 100 will cost  120,000 in 1931.  130,000 in 1932, and  140,000 in 1933 and thereafter; (b) if the R. 100 is scrapped, expenditure will be  50,000 in 1931 and not more than  20,000 in 1932 and thereafter.The Dominions and India have contributed&apos; so little to the cost of the 1924 programme that it is hardly neces-sar\- to consult them in advance. They should be notified of our deci-sion before any public announcement.Tho Admiralty do not desire to express any special view at this juncture other than their continued pre-ference for commercial, as opposed to govern-montal, development.If the R. 100 is scrapped, all these individuals, except 48, will have to be dismissed; if (say) 75 per cent, fail to obtain work elsewhere, they will cost the State some  12,000 per annum in unemployment benefit, until they do so.9. To turn now to the all-important question of finance. On the assumption that the R. 100 is refitted and recommissioned next spring or summer and that there are no unforeseen develop-ments, an expenditure of about  120,000 will be required in 1931, about  130,000 in 1932 and about  140,000 in 1933 and thereafter, so long as the R. 100 is kept in commission. This means that a supplementary estimate of  70,000 will be required this year, the sum of  50,000 provided in estimates having been expressly taken (by agreement with the Chancellor) &quot; on account &quot; pending a decision on future policy, with the understanding that a supplementary would be forthcoming, if required.If, on the other hand, it were decided to scrap the R. 100, the  50,000 would probably suffice to &quot;wind up &quot; Cardington and place it on a care and maintenance basis. The cost of the policy of the &apos;&apos; watching brief &apos;&apos; on this latter and more restricted basis Avould probably not exceed  20,000 per annum, the chief items being (a) Cardington, Ismailia and Karachi (i.e., measures necessary to prevent deterioration of plant and buildings), (b) a minimum technical staff, as above mentioned, to watch progress abroad and collate the reports received from (c) the officers attached in the U.S.A. and Germany, if their attachment proves possible.I may say that I have it in mind, should it be decided to scrap the R. 100, to endeavour to find some alternative use for Cardington, e.g., the experimental kite-balloon work normally carried on at Puliham in Norfolk might in future be carried out at Cardington (it has already been temporarily transferred thither), when the disposal of Pulham could be considered. But there is no need to complicate the issue by considering such schemes further at the present stage.10. The Dominions and India are, of course, closely interested in the question of future airship policy, and my colleagues may like me to supplement what I have said above as to how far their interest has taken concrete shape, and, therefore, to what extent the Empire as a wdiole may be considered as entitled to a voice in any decision on policy. Canada and India alone have made a substantial financial contribution. The mooring tower base at Montreal (which was utilised by the R. 100 on her Transatlantic flight) probably cost not far short of  120,000. India provided the site of the base at Karachi free of charge, paid the cost of the mooring tower there, and assisted in various minor ways, \e.g., by remission of import duties on the steelwork for the shed. But this Canadian and Indian expenditure, if consider-able, is small in relation to the  2,350,000 the United Kingdom has expended on an experiment from which all parts of the Empire stood to benefit just as much as these islands. I consider, therefore, that we need not consult the Dominions or India before taking a decisiom,-thoug-h-I would suggest, subject to the advice of the Secretaries of State for India and the Dominions, that we should, if possible, communicate our policy to them privately before any public announcement.11. I ought, perhaps, to add in conclusion that the Admiralty (who are interested in airships owing to their potential use for purposes of naval reconnaissance) have informed the Air Ministry that they do not wish, in present circumstances, to express any view on the question of future airship policy, beyond reiterating   their   preference   for   commercial,   rather   than
governmental development, if further development there is to be. ,The possibility of enlisting commercial interests should clearly be kept in view; but in present circumstances I am advised that there is no prospect of our being able to sell or lease our bases and other assets to such interests, or persuading them to participate in future development, unless on a basis of subsidies on so generous a scale that it would cost even more than a further governmental programme of new construction.Summary.12.   I ask, therefore, the decision of the Cabinet as to (a) Whether the policy of a &quot;watching brief&quot; of 3 or 4 years&apos; duration is approved. (&amp;) If so, what form this policy should take, i.e.: (i) Shall the R. 100 be refitted (as I recommend for the reasons given in paragraph 7 above, but bearing in mind that the lifting medium to be employed is hydrogen and that the vessel is equipped with petrol engines), entailing a total expenditure in the current year of  120,000, in 1932 of  130,000, and in 1933 and subsequent years of  140,000; or(ii) Shall the R. 100 be scrapped, when airship expenditure can probably be kept down to  50,000 this year, and  20,000 in subsequent years leaving us, however, severely handicapped, if not virtually crippled, should we wish, in the light of experience abroad, to embark on a new programme or airship development at some future date ?With a view to simplifying matters so far as possible i have omitted many non-essentials from this memorandum, and confined myself in the main to the broad outlines of the problem. But, once the Cabinet has decided the above questions, I suggest that the details can safely be left to be worked out between the Treasury and the Air Ministry.Summary of ques-tions requiring Cabinet 3eoision.Air Ministry, April 16, 1931.
