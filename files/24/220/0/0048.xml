DOClJiviEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS   :RITAK IC ilA.JESTY*S GOVERNIvE^TT.. )C A 3 1 H c TvLONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL. ^?^ copy now      A     . ,.MEMORANDUM sY THE MINISTER OP transport in memorandum H, A.0.(51) I informed my colleagues that I proposed to continue negotiations with the various interests with a view to seeing whether X could reach agreements which could be scheduled to the London Passenger Transport Bill before it leaves the Committee stage.   The advantages of such a course as compared with the expenses9 delays and risks of arbitration are undeniable0    I informed the House of Commons on the second reading that I was continuing, the negotiations which I had opened.I referred, in my memorandum, to the fact that LordAshfieldj on behalf of the interests which he representss wasurging very strongly that the Junior or nGn stock of tho board should not be a fixed interest bearing stock such as is usually issued by a public authority, and this for variousreasonsc    Perhaps the most important were:-(1) thflt in t,Mn way it would be possible to give the stockhclder-s.. a prospect of an improved return in iuxure years (subject to strict limits)i   and(2) that if the stock carried interest which would bo dependent on sufficient profits being earned to meet its the Board would not be in default if through special circumstances in a particular year it did not earn^the necessary return^   While I have no doubts as to the financial stability of the Board, if established on the basis of the Bill or on the terms to which I shall shortly refers it must be remembered that the Board will have behind it no contingent right to a Treasury guarantee (like the&quot;Central Electricity Board) and no right of precepting on the rates (like the Metropolitan Water Board).  .On this point Sir William McLintock advised measures follows:-
&quot;For the purpose of reaching agreement with the Underground interests and avoiding arbitration proceedings which in their ease would&apos;certainly be difficult and protracted^ it may be found desirable to reconsider the terms on which the &quot;C&quot; Transport Stock would be issued., and in this respect it has been suggested that the &quot;Gff Stock should carry-interest &quot;which would be dependent on sufficlant profits being earned to meet it and that a maximum rate of interest payable on the stock should be fixedt   The maximum rate of interest-would require to be higher than the rate contemplated in connection with the issue of a fixed interest bearing stock and the nominal value of the &quot;0&quot; Stock to be issued In substitution for existing stocks may also require to bo greater e   The Boards, however j, would only require to pay interest on the stock to the extent, to which the interest was earned and this would be 8 distinct advantage if unexpected circumstances arose which seriously depleted the earnin.&quot;sc.   The issue of such a stock would also eliminate any possible risk there may be in the Arbitration Tribunal making awards in excess of the values contemplatedc ,rOn resuming negotiations I found that, if there was to be any chance of an agreement, it would be necessary to devise a type of stock designed to meet the special case., As a res-alt of prolonged discussion X have been able to rfcsch a basis which Lord Ashfield is prepared to recommend to his Board and  if they agree, to the stockholders9 and to back with all his force end which X am equally ready to recommend to my colleagues and to Parliament, on w ose approvals of courses any agreement must be conditional0The amount of the Board0a stools to be issued In exchange for the stocks of the existing companies was naturally the subject of difficult negotiation,.    The basis srhich X have been able provisionally to&apos; agree is briefly described in the annexed note..    It has the full support of -Sir William MoLintock who regards it as reasonable and not ^favourable-    X was myself satisfied that nothing less would, be accepted by Lord Ashfield and5 in view of the great public advantages to be gained by avoidance of all the risks of an arbitration and from the continuity of
management which 1 can now secure, I shall defend it with confidence.Features of the &quot;C&quot; Stock which are of special interest are these:-CD   Interest will be dependent on profits and will not be cumulativej(ii)   For two yesrs from the appointed day it will carry interest at a maximum rate of b% and thereafter at a rate of 5^%&apos;,(ill)   The next charge on the revenues of the Board will be Sitsking Fund Charges on its prior stocks^ when they become payable, (f-inking Fund Charges will be suspended for 10 years as proposed in the Bill),These will all be charges which it will be theduty of the Board to meet,(ivJST further earnings accrue they are to be assigned in the first two years wholly to reserve and thereafter to be divided equally between i reserve and to increase the rate of interest j payable up to a maximum of 6%0    Beyond that point any surplus would be wholly applicable j to reserve for the purposes of the uoaru,       iThe &quot;C&quot; stock will not be the subject ofa Statutory Sinking Fund, such as would be normal in thecase of a fixed interest bearing stocky but It will beopen to the Board to apply Its surplus revenue to thispurpose.    It will also be redeemable at the end ef S5years at the option of the Boards who will thus be ableeventually to replace it by a fixed interest bearing&quot;stcok, on the usual sinking fund basis, if that course Isljfound desirable.    It is necessary to provide some security for the stockholders^ who will notCand should not) have any representative on the board a    It is, therefore^proposed that they should be entitled to apply for appointment of a receiver and manager in the veryimprobable event of interest not being paid at the rate of&amp;- % Cor fin respect of the first two years &amp;%) for threeconsecutive years.
^4- &amp; b uiSir William McLintock is satisfied that the ear -ings which the Companies concerned will bring to the Board will suffice to meet the interests and other charges specified to be payable and leave some margin^ now provided the constitution of the Board is such as to give confidence, the terms attaching to the WC&quot; Stock should enable the Board to raise further capital on satisfactory terms In due course,, This is sn important factor to beer in mind in connexion with any settlement.The position for the time being must be kept extremely confidential for many reasons.   Lori Ashfield will, however^ convene a meeting of his shareholders as soon as I sen tell him that the Government are prepared to recommend the arrangement to Parliament and it is obvious that in the interests of the scheme and the Bill an Immediate decision is necessary.X am at once pursuing negotiations with other important Interests and if they wepe speedily successful the progress of the Bill would be greatly helped.The petitions against the Kill are naturally numerous.     They have only Just been lodged and are being examined.     If any new points arise out of them or out of the Committee proceedingss with which it Is necessary to trouble my colleaguess X will deal with them in a further memorandum.Meanwhile I ask for assent,to conclude the agreement with Lord Ashfield&quot;s companies subject to confirmation by Parliament and, to make the necessary detailed amendments in the Bill subject to the concurrence of the Treasury on points in which they are concerned,(Intld,,) E,, J.-I-
5fKPROPOSED TSRJS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE UNDERGROUND GROUPOFCOMPANIES.lc   The basis of the proposals provisionally agreed for the acquisition of the Underground Group of Companies by the London Passenger Transport Board is an exchange of stocks of the Board for the stocks and shares of the several Operating Companies c2C    It was necessary first to determine the nature of the stocks to be Issued by the Board and the order in which the incoma of the Board was to be applied in meeting its oblljations0 It has been agreed that there should be stocks as&quot;A&quot; stoekj. carrying Interest at 4&amp; per cent, to be treated as equivalent to debenture stookoNote;    It may be desirable that a class of &quot;a&quot; stock at 5 per cent should be created ranking parl passu with the 4&amp;Jo stocky so as to avoid the writing up-of capital values in respect of same part of the exchange 0&quot;T-.F ,a.-n stocky carrying interest at 4^ per cent4, tocover the guaranteed second debenture stocks issued under the termsof the Trade Facilities Actse&quot;B&quot; stock, carrying interest at 5 per cent, to be treated as equivalent to preference stockaAll the above are to be trustee securities B&quot;C&quot; atocks dejjendent upon each yearss earnings for itsInterest, the interest thus not being cumulative. The rate of interest not to exceed 5 per cent for the first two years?   thereafter the obligation of the Board to be to pay a rate of 5^ per cento     In additions, such further rate will be paid as can be provided out of the balance referred to below, with. a maximum of 6 per cent a&quot;c&quot; stock to be redeemable at par after 25 years at the option of the Board03Q   After paying 5 per cent or 5^ par cent, as the case may be, upon the &quot;G&quot; stock the revenue of the Board to be applied in setting aside a sinking fund provision for the redemption ofthe &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ToFoAo&quot; and &quot;B&quot; stocks within a term of 90 years, such provision ic be ^uapendod for 10 years after the institution ofthe Board,
In the first two years the whole of any balance will be set aside to general reserveo     After the first two years any balance will be divided equally between reserve and additional interest until the total rate of interest on the &quot;0&quot; stock reaches Any further balance will go wholly to reserve. The general reserve to be applied in the discretion of the Board either to meet any deficiency in interest on any class of stock or towards the development of the undertakings or otherwise as may seem advantageous in the interests of the undertekingok-o     Stock holders whose interest is impaired are to haverights to apply to the Gourt for appointment of a receiver andmanager under the following conditions:-(a) tfAtfB &quot;ToF.A.&quot; snd &quot;B&quot; stockholders immediately theinterest is in arreapD(b) &quot;0&quot; stock holders when their interests, being the specified rate of 5 or- 5i Pe** cent as the ease may bee is in arrear in respect of three consecutive years(c) Action only to be taken by holders of not less than 500? 000 in value of the stocks affeetedr.5c     So far       the common fund companies (i.e0 the fourElectric Railway Companies and the London General OmnibusCompany) sre concernedp it was agreed that as the interests and dividends on the prior charge securities of these Companies were fully oovereds stocks of the Board of the &quot;A&quot;e &quot;T^PoAc&quot; and &quot;B&quot;classes should be issued to the extent necessary to yield an equivalent income;.&quot;A&quot; stook generally for debenture and rent charge stocks.&quot;T.P.A.&quot; stock for second debenture stocks-guaranteedunder the Trade Facilities Acts0 ,fB&quot; stook generally for preference stocks.In determining the terms to be offered for the ordinarystocks and shares of the Common Fund Group of Companies, regardwas had to the average net earnings of those Companies for theyears 1928 - 1950 inclusive.     After charging debenture interest
and preference dividends the net earnings for 1989 9 adjusted by Sir      McLintockj were in round figures  1,294,000,     The Companies claim that the average net earnings for the three years 1928-1930 were in excess of this figure by some  ;7C,,00Qc.70   By way of deduction from these net earnings the Minister claimed to make allowance for the effect of Section 13 of the London Traffic Acts 1924, which provided that no tranapox^t undertaking was in the event of public purchase 9 to slaim an exhanced price by reason of the protection against unrestricted competition afforded by such Act.     No definite claim was formulated.By way of addition to these net&apos; earnings, the Companies advance a claim in respect of the future growth of their trafficsf the unfructified capital which they have investedf and other similar items, but again no defined claim was formulated?8*   After protracted negotiations it was agreed that ,;C&quot; stock should be exchanged for the ordinary stocks and shares of the Common Fund Companies on the basis of  92-1 of &quot;C&quot; stock for every  100 of such stocks and shares, subject to adjustment in respect of the ordinary share capital of the London General Omnibus Company.     The ordinary capital of the Omnibus Company pays a rate of dividend of &amp;% free of tax equivalent to twice tn dividend paid by the four railway companies and under the adjustment is given a double allotment.     For the purpose of the (-&apos;.-.,settlement, the total ordinary capital of the five Companies was agreed as follows:-Metropolitan District Railway Company London Electric Railway Company City &amp; South London Railway Company Central London Railway CompanyLondon General Omnibus Company, Ltd.TOTAL	 3	r235 s,0009	p327f9401	f480?0003	?000s00017	,042,9405	9500,00022	,,542,940.
In respect of this  28,642,940 nominal agreed amounts of stocks and shares, these Companies would receive from the Board  20,852,220 in &quot;0&quot; stock, subject however to an adjustment described below.    At the moment, the dividend paid by the Hail way Companies on their existing ordinary stocks is 5 per centc    When the exchange is completed the yield in relation to the existing nominal value will be to holders (other than the Underground holding company which is affected by the adjustment just mentioned) for the first two years at 4.62&amp; per cent, and thereafter 5*0875 per cent, with a prospect of a further addition out of the margins of profit of the Bo aid in such years if the full 6% is paid, bringing the total yield np to 5*65 per cent.     The London General Omnibus Company now distributes a dividend upon its existing capital of 8 per cent fioe of tax, representing an inclusive dividend of 10*5 per cent at the present rate of tax,9.   Turning to the London and Suburban Traction Company*s Group of Subsidiaries consisting of the three Tramway Companies and the Tramways M.E.T. Omnibus Company, the position oroved to be a difficult one.     The Metropolitan Electric Tramways Limited and the London United Tramways Limited showed, after nuking full allowance for depreciation and obsolescence, losses on operation in the years 1928?1930 inclusive.     The South Metropolitan Electric Tramways and Lighting Company Limited only shoved a profit in respect of its electricity supply undertaking.    The Tramways (H.E.T.) Omnibus Company Limited was the one Company with a satisfactory income upon which to base taras of acquisition.Hecourse was therefore had to the current market values of the stocks and shares of these Companies and to their prospects. An allowance was made in respect of these valuec and prospects which Sir w. McLintock regarded as fair and a schedule of exchange terms was eventually agreed, involving the issui. of Board stocks
iJ \J Jof all classes to an amount or approximately  2e70G9000e     This includes a sum of  688960S in respect of shares in an Electricity Undertaking which it is proposed to sell back. Lord Ashfield has given me an assurance that these shares will he retained in British control*The valuation of certain subsidiary undertakings baa. given rise to no special difficulties and the amounts involved ar-i not relatively important*10c    It will be remembered that all these companies are controlled &quot;by a holding company known as the Underground Electric Railways Company of London..     This company holds the majority of the ordinary stocks of the four railways and the whole of the ordinary stock of the L.S.O.C.     It also controls the tramways through another holding company to which reference has already been made - the London and Suburban Traction CompereThe question how far these holding companies should b?i wound up and/the manner in which that is to be done is still under c ons iderat i on.     Certain adjustments are v however s propose-,!, affecting them-.    , The Underground Company will surrender the small amount of &quot;A&quot; Stock ( 126 5347) to which it would be entitled in respect of Its holdings in subsidiary companies for an equivalent amount of &quot;3&quot; Stock.It has further been agreed that there shall be substituted for  3,853,752 of &quot;C&quot; stocks which would be issued to the operating companies under the arrangement already described? an equivalent amount of &quot;B,v Stock subject to a deduction of  250,000 in the remaining amount of &quot;0&quot; Stock;, by way of consideration for the better security^.It is estimated that out of the. B% dividend now paid on its ordinary shares by the Underground Company &amp;% is attributable to holdings in transport companies which will be transferred to tbs board     When the shareholders in this company have received
the Board9s stocks issued in exchange the income which they will derive is equivalent to dividends upon the existing ordinary shares s-For the first 2 years at 5o75$ Thereafter if 0 stock pays 5^% &quot;   6o325^if G stock pays 6% &quot;   6*9%While I mention these figures9 it may he remembered that the rates of interest which the &quot;C&quot; stocic will in fact pay are contingent upon the earnings and increasing prosperity of the Board*The Underground Company will retain its interest in -The Associated Equipment Company9 subject to the contract between that, company and the L.G.0.0. for the supply of omnibuses being reduced to a period of 10 years and being otherwise reasonable in its terms and certain other non-transport interests..11o   The total amount of Board stock of all classes to be issued under the arrangement to Companies in the Underground Group is approximately  76 ,.000,000*
