his document Is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. klilCRET.. CABINET. No....P4 88(51)REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BILL.UNIVERSITY REPRESENTATION.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Sir Samuel Hoare has given notice to ask on Wednesday, the15th instant, a Question In the following terms&quot;TO ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will state when the Government amendments required to bring the Third Schedule of the Representation of the People (No,2) Bill Into conformity with the decision of the House on university representation will appear on the paper.&quot;The answer to be given to Sir Samuel Ho ore largely turns onthe question whether the Government should accept the decision ofthe House with regard to the abolition of university representationor should attempt to reinsert on Report Stage Clause 4 which hasbeen deleted from the Bill.    I understand also that it is proposedto take the three remaining days of the Committee Stage of the Billin the week beginning on the 20th instant, and it is accordinglynecessary for the Cabinet now to decide its policy with regard touniversity representation.On the one hand, the proposal to abolish universityrepresentation was an important feature of the Government&apos;s bill and it can be urged with great force that the Government should hotaccept the decision of the House,    The acceptance by the House ofCommons, on Clause 3, of the principle of the abolition of pluralvoting increases in one respect the objection to retaining theuniversity constituencies.   A university elector can in futureexercise only one vote at a General Election, either in respect ofhis university qualification, or in respect of his residencequalification, or in respect of a business premises qualificationIn the City of London.   There are at present only come 120,000university electors, who return 12 Tlembers to Parliament, and infuture the number of persons voting in respect of a university/qualification
qualification will be considerably reduced, since no doubt a considerable number of university electors will prefer to exercise their vote in the constituency in which they reside.On the other hand,  the abolition of plural voting has removed one of the grounds on which university representation is open to attack,  and there is undoubtedly a strong feeling in many quarters-against abolishing university representation altogether0In coming to a decision in this matter, the Cabinet will no doubt wish to take Into consideration how fan their decision may involve any alteration In the time-table laid down by the guillotine motion adopted by the House on the 3rd March last.If the decision of the Government is to accept the omission of Clause 4, the following consequential amendments are required, some of which can be made either in Committee or on Report Stage and others only on Report.(1)    On Report Stage,  amendment of Clause 1 would be necessary (because the existing method of election in university constituencies is Proportional Representation) and it may also be necessary to embody the principle of the abolition of plural voting in a separate new Clause,  instead of relying upon the application to the universities of the provision on the subject in Clause 3, \vhich deals with the abolition of the business premises qualification and the position of the City of London,(2)   As regards the remaining Clauses of the Bill, only the following minor amendments, which could be made in Committee stage, would be necessary to bring those Clauses into harmony with the omission of Clause 4(a)    Clause 8(2) would have to be re-drafted so as to provide in Subsection (2) of Section 27 of the Act of 1918  (relating to the forfeiture of deposits by candidates) both for elections held under the system of Proportional Representation (universities) and according to the principle of the alternative vote,/(b)
i i g(b)    It would also seem necessary to add to Clause 8 a provision to deal with the declaration required of university electors at a General Election.(e)    It will &quot;be necessary to move amendments deleting the latter part of Subclause (3) of Clause 9 and Part II of the Third Schedule which repeals certain provisions of the existing law connected with university representation. These consequential amendments  (whether they are moved on Committee Stage or on Report) would not involve any alteration of the time-table prescribed by the guillotine motion.If on the other hand the Government decide to ask the House to restore Clause 4 to the Bill, no action will be necessary on the Committee Stage, as obviously there is no object in the Government moving amendments, as Indicated above, which would have to be negatived again on Report Stage if the Clause Is restored.   Clause 4, however, will have to be moved as a new Clause at the beginning of the Report Stage, and the necessary discussion of this proposal on the Report Stage would take up a good deal of panliamentary time.   The House would no doubt wish to devote the whole of the first day to a discussion of the principle of university representation.   The guillotine provides that on the first day new Clauses and Clauses 1 to 4 should be disposed of, and if the whole of that day is taken up with the discussion of the new Clause, pressure which it would be very difficult to resist would be brought to bear on the Government to provide additional time for the Report Stage.On the whole, the balance of advantage seems to lie in the direction of accepting the decision of the House, but I should be glad if the Cabinet would consider the question and would advise me as to the policy which I should announce on behalf of the Government..J .R eC .10th April, 1931.
