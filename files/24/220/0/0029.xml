INTRODUCTORY NOTE.A detailed account of the scope and method of calculation of the statistics relating to changes in working-class cost of living which are regularly compiled by the Ministry of Labour and published in the monthly issues of the &quot; Ministry of Labour Gazette &quot; was given in an article in the February, 1921, issue of that &quot; Gazette &quot;, and a shorter explanation was published in a further article in the issue for July, 1923.As those issues are now out of print it has been thought desirable, in view of the considerable number of collective agreements which are still in operation embodying arrangements for the periodical adjustment of wage rates in accordance with the variations in the cost of living index figure, that the particulars given should be brought up to date and republished.The principles on which the statistics are compiled have re-remained unchanged since the first inception of the index number, and the only noteworthy alterations which have occurred on points of detail are the exclusion of particulars relating to the area now within the Irish Free State and the extension of the scope of the figures to include the rents of de-controlled houses.The &quot; Ministry of Labour Gazette &quot;, in which the detailed statistics are regularly published, is issued on or about the 18th of each month, and is obtainable from H.M. Stationery Office, either directly or through any bookseller (price 6d. per copy; annual subscription 7s., including postage).Ministry of Labour, Statistics Branch.March, 1931.
METHOD  OF  COMPILATION.(A).-GENERAL  SIGNIFICANCE  OF THE STATISTICS.As the phrase &quot; increase in the cost of living &quot; can be inter-preted in various ways, it should at the outset be observed that the statistics prepared by the Ministry of Labour are designed to measure the average increase in the cost of maintaining unchanged the pre-war standard of living of the working classes. By this is meant the standard actually prevailing in working-class families just before the war, irrespective of whether or not such standard was adequate.Pre-war family expenditure, of course, varied widely in different cases according to the total family income, and the actual increase in shillings and pence per week which would be necessary to maintain this standard unchanged would vary in a corresponding manner. For example, if the cost of every commodity had in-creased by 50 per cent, since 1914, the money increase necessary to maintain the pre-war standard would be 10s. per week in the case of a family whose weekly pre-war expenditure was 20s. (making a total of 80s.), whilst it would be 30s. in the case of a family whose pre-war expenditure was 60s. (making a total of 90s.). It is therefore more generally convenient to express the increase in the form of a percentage, which can be applied to different amounts of pre-war expenditure. Even where the total weekly expenditure was the same in different families, however, the distribution of this expenditure over different commodities varied considerably according to the numbers of persons in the family, their ages, sex and mode of living; and as some articles have risen less in price than others, even the percentage increase would vary to some extent with different families. It is obvious, in these conditions, that no single figure with regard to the increase in cost of living can apply exactly to individual cases, and that if the increase is to be expressed in the form of a single percentage the only practicable method is to calculate a fair general average, from which the actual figure for individual families will diverge, the increase being somewhat lower in some cases and higher in others than the figure quoted. This is the method adopted by the Ministry of Labour. In actual practice the variations from the average would not as a rule be very great, provided that the articles and the quantities of each article bought at the present&apos; time were the same as were bought before the war.9428 A 2THE COST OF LIVING INDEX NUMBER.
It may here be remarked that, owing to the variations in the amounts of increase in the prices of different commodities economies or re-adjustments in expenditure have no doubt been effected in many families, especially in those cases where incomes have not increased so much as prices; on the other hand, the standard of living has probably been raised in many families in which wages have been increased in greater proportion than prices. No account is taken in the figures of any such alterations in the standard of living, as to which trustworthy statistics are not available.(B). ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICS.The items included.in the statistics fall into five main groups, viz., food, rent, clothing, fuel and light, and certain other items. The prices used for the statistics are in all cases the retail prices. The statistics of wholesale prices published by the Board of Trade are an entirely different compilation. It will be convenient to consider each of the five main groups of items separately.I. Pood.Collection of Information. The foodstuffs included in the statis-tics are beef, mutton, bacon, fish, flour, bread, potatoes, tea, sugar, milk, butter, margarine, cheese, and eggs. These normally account for three-fourths of working-class family expenditure on food, and the inclusion of a greater number of articles of relatively minor importance would not materially affect the average percentage in-crease. The most important omission is that of fruit and vegetables (other than potatoes), which it is impracticable to include in a monthly series of retail prices index numbers, owing to the wide variations in quality, the &quot; seasonal &quot; variations in supplies, and the consequent impossibility of obtaining continuous and compar-able records of prices.Information as to the predominant retail prices of the above articles of food is collected at the beginning of each month, by the Managers of Employment Exchanges and Branches,* from repre-sentative retailers (including co-operative societies, large &quot; multi-pie &quot; firms, and private shopkeepers) conducting a working-class trade. Information is obtained in all towns with a population ex-ceeding 50,000 at the Census of 1911, and in a representative selection of 420 smaller towns and villages distributed throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland ; altogether in 509 towns and villages. The total number of retailers from whom this informa-tion as to prices of food is collected is well over 5,000 and many of these retailers have a number of shops at which identical prices are maintained.* As regards tea application is made to retailers direct from the Ministry of Labour, through the post.
* All processes of tabulation, and computation are carefully checked to ensure accuracy; the returns received are subjected to a critical examination, and supplementary enquiries are made where necessary. It has not been thought necessary to repeat this in every section of this statement.t Separate returns are obtained for different districts in the Metropolitan Area, and by this means London is given its appropriate weight in the statistics.Compilation of Statistics. The local officers of the Ministry summarise the information obtained in their districts and forward statements showing, for the articles of food included, the predominantly-nant prices being charged by the retailers supplying particulars at the current date and the amount of the change in such predominant prices since the previous report. Both these sets of figures are tabulated * in the Department, as a useful check is provided by comparing the current prices with those of the previous month as altered by the changes reported. The reports and tabulation sheets are then scrutinised by an experienced officer of the Department, and if this scrutiny reveals discrepancies or apparent inaccuracies, needing further explanation, such supplementary enquiries as may be necessary are made in order that the figures may be verified or corrected. The columns of tabulation are then added, and the average price of each article is arrived at, separately for large townsf (those with populations over 50,000) and for smaller places, bv taking the unweighted arithmetical average (i.e., the figures tabulated for each item are added together and divided by the total number of entries). A calculation is then made of the percentage increase in the price of each article, as shown by compar-ing the average price for the current date with that for July, 1914. The percentage for the country as a whole is obtained for each article by taking the arithmetic mean (i.e., the middle point) between the percentage for the large towns and that for the smaller places.Having thus arrived at the average percentage increase in the price of each separate article of food, it is necessary to combine these percentages so as to obtain a single figure representing (the general average increase in food prices. The individual percentages vary considerably, milk, for example, having increased in price, at 1st January, 1931, by 84 per cent, and bread by 29 per cent., on average. As very different proportions of income were spent on milk, bread and other items, it would not be correct simply to add together the percentages shown for these items and divide by the number of items. It is necessary to allow for the difference in the importance of each item in the pre-war budget, and this is done by multiplying each percentage by a number (generally described, for convenience, as a &quot; weight &quot;) based on the relative importance of the several articles and dividing the sum of the products by the sum of these &quot; weights.&quot; The &quot; weights &quot; used are as follows : beef 48,
mutton 24, bacon 19, fish 9, flour 20, bread 50, tea 22, sugar 1!), i milk 25, butter 41, cheese 10, margarine 10, eggs 19, potatoes 18, I making a total of 334.These &quot; weights &quot; are based on the average expenditure shown by 1,944 urban working-class family budgets collected by the Board of Trade in 1904. The adoption of &quot; weights &quot; based on the ex-penditure of 1904 was not invalidated by changes in quantities between 1904 and 1914, because the changes in quantity (which were generally slight) were largely counterbalanced by changes in price-level, with the result that the proportion of income spent on the different commodities could not have been sensibly altered8 ex-cept as regards margarine, for which a special allowance was made.The following table illustrates the arithmetical process by which the general average for food is computed from the percentage in-creases for the several items.   The percentages given are thoseobtained from the returns for 1st January, 1931.				(0	(2)	(3)	(4)	(5)Article.

(as regards articles omitted, see first paragraph under &quot; food.&quot;)
Iu view of some misconceptions which have arisen as to the (  &quot; basis &quot; of the statistics, it is worthy of emphasis that the real &quot; basis &quot; of the monthly variations recorded is the ascertainment of prices which is carried out every month and that the budgets are used only in determining the proportions in which to combine the percentage increases ascertained for the various items in order to arrive at a final index number. It will be apparent from the foregoing illustration that the budget figures are used merely to indicate the relative importance to be attached to the percentage increases in prices ascertained for different commodities for the purpose of arriving at the &quot; weights &quot; or multipliers used in combining those increases into a general percentage, and that if, for example, expenditure on every item in the budget were doubled, and all the resulting &quot; weights &quot; were doubled, the resulting calcu-lation, as may be seen by experiment, would give exactly the same percentage increase as before. The calculation is designed to show the average percentage increase in the cost of maintaining un-changed the average working-class dietary as it was before the war, and it is no part of the jmrpose of the statistics to consider whether that dietary was or was not adequate. It may also be observed that small alterations in the proportion of expenditure on different items would not appreciably affect the calculations.II. Rent.Collection of Information. The information relates to the rents, inclusive of local rates and water charges, of unfurnished dwellings of the types usually occupied by working-class families. From July, 1920 to July, 1923, increases in rents of such dwellings (except of new dwellings) were limited by the provisions of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, and the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act, 1923, in the main continues the provisions of the Act of 1920 as regards rents, with the exception that rents of dwellings becoming vacant are, except in certain circumstances, removed from the control of the Act. Until 1928 the proportion of de-controlled rents was not large enough to affect substantially the average results for working-class dwellings as a whole and the statistics of changes in rents were based on controlled rents only. Since that date, de-controlled rents have also been taken into account.The information collected accordingly falls under two headings, viz., that relating to controlled and that relating to de-controlled rents.In respect of controlled rents, enquiries have been made, usually through the post at half-yearly intervals corresponding with the rating periods, of Town Clerks and other officials of local authorities
and of Property Owners&apos; Associations. The particulars which have I been obtained relate to 39 large towns and indicate the amounts of f increase regarded as being permissible for variously rented working- p class properties, and the extent to which the increases have been applied.In respect of de-controlled rents, information has been collected from Town Clerks and other officials of local authorities, from 1 Property Owners&apos; Associations and from house-agents in 29 large 1 towns as to (a) the proportions of working-class tenancies which 1 have been de-controlled, and (b) the increases in rents of such I dwellings, since they ceased to be controlled.1Compilation of Statistics. In respect of controlled rents, the information as to the amounts of increase regarded as being permis- j sible in the various towns is tabulated separately for each of various amounts of pre-war rents (e.g., of 4s., 5s., 6s., 7s., in-clusive of rates and water charges, for most of the towns for which information is received). Prom the amounts so tabulated average amounts of increase are computed, regard being had to the vai-ying populations of the different towns, and from these averages the average percentage increases for each of the respective pre-war rents are calculated. These increases are then combined into a single figure representing the average percentage increase regarded as being permissible. This average increase is then adjusted on the basis of information given on the returns received, in order to make the necessary allowance for cases in which the increases regarded as permissible have not been imposed to their full extent.In respect of de-controlled rents, the particulars obtained from different sources are summarised in order to arrive at (a) the ratio between the numbers of tenancies at de-controlled and at controlled rents, and (b) the relationship of de-controlled rents to pre-war rents ; and the summarised figures are then combined into general averages under each heading (a) and (b), regard being had to the varying populations of the different towns from which the informa-tion is received.By combination of the average percentage increases since 1914 thus calculated for controlled and de-controlled rents respectively, in accordance with their relative proportions, a final figure is obtained, representing the average percentage increase since 1914 in the level of controlled and de-controlled rents combined.III. Clothing.Collection of Information. In order to estimate the increase in prices of clothing, information is obtained as to the movement of retail prices of men&apos;s suits and overcoats (ready-made and bespoke), woollen and cotton materials, underclothing and hosiery,* and
boots. The statistics relate to those descriptions of articles which4? Q *y were most generally purchased by the working classes before the- l&quot; war, i.e., to relatively low-priced grades.Enquiry forms, distributed and collected through the post, are completed each month by 300 representative outfitters, drapers, and boot retailers in 81 towns. Some of these retailers have large numbers of branches. The descriptions of (articles for which quotations are given vary with different retailers, but before the form is despatched to a retailer the prices quoted by him at the previous enquiry are entered on it, and he is asked to quote the current prices for the same articles and qualities as before, or for the most nearly corresponding articles and qualities.Compilation of Statistics. For other commodities, e.g., food-stuffs, the predominant prices are averaged and this average forms the basis of the final figures. For articles of clothing, however, the range of prices and qualities is so wide that this method is unsuitable. The method adopted is therefore to compute sep-arately the percentage change during the month shown by each quotation, to average these percentages for each article, and thence to calculate the average percentage increase since July, 1914, by linking-up these figures with those obtained for earlier dates. The resultant average changes for the several articles are then collected into six groups, as follows : (1) men&apos;s suits and over-coats, (2) woollen material for women&apos;s outer garments, (3) woollen underclothing and hosiery, (4) cotton material for women&apos;s outer garments, (5) cotton underclothing material and hosiery, (6) boots. The percentage change for each such group is then arrived at by taking the average of the percentage changes for the constituent articles, allowance being made in group (1) for the difference in the relative importance of ready-made and bespoke clothing and of suits and overcoats.It will be observed that some of the information collected re-lates to the prices of materials for clothing, instead of some of the articles of clothing themselves, partly because comparative prices of materials can be obtained over a long period with a greater measure of accuracy and partly because many families buy materials and either arrange for making-up or make them up at home. Information as to the charges for making-up has been obtained by special enquiry of dressmakers with a working-class custom, and in utilising the prices of materials to obtain an estimate of the amount of the increase in the price of garments,* Viz., costume cloth, tweed, serge, frieze, cashmere, flannel, flannelette calico, longcloth, cotton shirting, print, zephyr, sateen, drill, galatea, woollen vests (men&apos;s and women&apos;s), woollen pants, men&apos;s merino socks and cotton socks, women&apos;s woollen stockings and cotton stockings. This list of articles was, of course, drawn up before the War, and so long as the index-number is related to pre-war conditions it is necessary to retain the list of articles for which sufficient information as to pre-war prices is available.
for combination with the increases for finished articles in order to&apos; obtain the general percentage increase in the prices of clothim generally, allowance is made for the fact that the charges foi making-up have not changed similarly, the percentage increases shown by the materials in groups (2) and (4) being combined witt that relating to the charges for making-up materials by giving in each case a &apos;&apos; weight &quot; of 3 for the material to 1 for the cost ol making-up. In arriving at these &quot; weights &quot; of 3 and 1, allow-ance has been made for the fact that in some cases the garment; are made up at home ; where this is done the increase in the cost of the material, of course, closely represents the increase in the cos of the garment.The final percentage representing the general increase in the retail prices of clothing is computed by averaging the figures for the six groups those for groups (2) and (4) being first modified on account of the cost of making up materials the relatively greater importance of group (1) and the smaller importance of group (4) being recognised by giving a &quot; weight &quot; of 1J to group (1) and a &quot; weight &quot; of i to group (4), compared with a &quot; weight &quot; of 1 for each of the other four groups.It will be recognised that owing to the wide range of quotations. &apos;. both now and before the war, to changes in qualities and in stocksm held by retailers, and to variations in the extent to which different t articles and qualities have been affected by price-changes, it i- If not possible to make exact calculations of the average percentage 1; changes in prices of clothing.   The percentages arrived at by the! method of averaging described above should, therefore, be re-1 garded only as approximate indications, which may be taken to beK broadly representative of the general course of prices of the cheaper I classes of clothing.IV.  Fuel and Light.Collection of Information. The items included in this group I are coal, gas, oil, candles and matches. Statements as to the retail 1 prices of coal are obtained each month, through the post, from coal merchants and local correspondents in 29 of the principal towns; and statements as to the prices of gas are obtained, quarterly or monthly, from gas undertakings and local corres-coorespondents in 24 of the principal towns. Be turns as to the prices of lamp oil are obtained each month, through the post, from 84 re-tailers in 49 towns, and returns as to the prices of candles and matches are obtained each month from over 300 retailers in 91 towns. When an enquiry is despatched, except as to gas, for which the precaution is unnecessary, the prices returned at the previous enquiry are always supplied, so as to ensure that the quotations shall be comparable.
90 0Compilation of Statistics. The prices quoted are tabulated and &amp; o&apos; 0 average prices are then arrived at by totalling the quotations and dividing by the number of entries. A computation is then made of the percentage increase shown by the current average price of each article over the corresponding average price of July, 1914. The percentage increases so ascertained are combined into a general average for fuel and light by weighting them in accordance with their approximate relative importance in pre-war working-class family expenditure, the proportions taken being 6 for coal, 3 for eras and 0.7 for oil, candles and matches together.V. Other Items.Collection of Information. The items included in the statistics under this heading are soap and soda; domestic ironmongery, brush-ware and pottery *; tobacco and cigarettes; fares; and newspapers. Of these, the prices of soap and soda are ascertained each month, through the post, from over 300 retailers in 91 towns. Prices of ironmongery, brmshware and pottery are ascertained from 65 re-tailers in 40 towns. For tobacco and cigarettes quotations are taken from manufacturers&apos; retail price lists. Particulars of changes in railway fares are obtained from the railway companies and from the Ministry of Transport, and particulars of changes in tramway fares are obtained from the principal tramway undertakings. - The prices of 87 daily and weekly newspapers circulating largely among the working classes are taken from the press.Compilation of Statistics1. For soap, soda, and tobacco the quota-tions are tabulated and added, the totals so obtained are divided by the number of quotations, and the resultant averages are corn-pared with pre-war averages similarly obtained in order to arrive at the average increase. For ironmongery, brushes and pottery, for which the actual prices vary considerably according to the des-description of article, the method adopted is similar to that followed in dealing with clothing prices, referred to above, the percentage change shown by each quotation being computed and all the per-centages for each article being then added and averaged. A similar method is adopted for newspapers. For railway fares the average percentage increase is calculated from various particulars supplied by the railway companies and the Ministry of Transport, ordin-ary third-class fares (single and return) and workmen&apos;s fares being taken into account. For tramway fares (workmen&apos;s and ordinary) comparison has been made of the cost, in 1914 and at the current date, of travelling various distances, account being taken of the number of passengers travelling such distances, as indicated by the number of tickets issued at each rate of faie.* Including saucepans, kettles, frypans, bowls, pails, scrubbing brushes, banister brushes, brooms, cups and saucers, plates, basins, dishes, jugs and tea-pots.
CO.-COMBINATION OF ALL ITEMS INCLUDED.In order to arrive at a single figure representing the increase since July, 1914, in the prices of all the items taken together, the average per-centage increases under each of the main groups of expenditure referred to above are combined in accordance with their estimated relative importance in average pre-war working-class expenditure, the &quot; weights &quot; used being as follows : food. 7J; rent (including rates), 2i; clothing, 1J; fuel and light, 1; other items included, \. In other words, the percentage increase ascer-tained for food is multiplied by 7J, that for rent by 2, and so on with the other groups; the results are added together, and the total is divided by 12J (the sum of the multipliers or &quot; weights &quot;). The effect is to obtain approximately the average percentage in-crease in the cost of maintaining unchanged the pre-war standard of living in working-class families.With regard to the basis of these &quot; weights &quot;, the budgets collected in 1904, to which reference has already been made, showed that, on the average, 22s. 6d. out of a family income of 36s. lOd. per week was spent on food, or about three-fifths of the total. Between 1904 and 1914 there were almost equal increases, on the average, in prices and wages, and although the cost of food rose less, on average, than that of other commodities, it is un-likely that expenditure on food before the war in 1914 would have varied materially from three-fifths of the total expenditure on all the items included in these statistics. The total &quot; weight &quot; allotted to food is, therefore, three-fifths of the total of 12J, i.e., 71Information as to rents, which was obtained in the course of an Enquiry into Cost of Living in 1912, showed that the average work-ing-class rent in the industrial towns was about 5s. 6d. to 6s. per week. In 1914 it was a little higher probably about 6s. per week.* That is to say, the proportion which rent formed of the total weekly family expenditure on the items included in these* In some towns, notably London, the rents paid were considerably higher than the amounts stated, whilst in others they were appreciably lower.The increases so ascertained for each of the items in this groutf are then combined, after consideration of the relative importance of the different items, so as to enable the Department to form an estimate of the average increase in prices of these items, taken as a whole, and its effect on the general percentage increase for all items. There is considerable variation both in the total amount of expenditure and in the distribution of the amount among the several items, but the absence of an exact statistical basis for &quot; weighting &quot; does not impair the value of results, as there is no scope for any serious error resulting from the &quot; weights &quot; used, the expenditure on the items in this -group being, on the average, small relatively to the total family expenditure.
statistics amounted to between one-sixth and one-seventh, and the &quot; weight &quot; taken for rent is accordingly 2, out of the total of 12J.As regards clothing, there are wide variations in the expenditure of different sections of the working classes, but pre-war investiga-tions showed that, on the average, expenditure on clothing before the war was less than that on rent, in many cases much less. In the absence of exact statistics a &quot; weight &apos;.&apos; of 1  (out of a total of l2i) is taken for clothing, on the basis of pre-war expenditure by working-class families estimated to average 4s. 6d. to 5s. a week.For fuel and light also there are no extensive statistical data as to expenditure before the war, but the available information indicates that the average expenditure was probably about 2s. 9d. to 3s. a week, which yields a &quot; weight &quot; of 1 (out of a total of 121). The &apos;&apos; weight &quot; of J for the other items included was taken as fairly representing average expenditure on these particular items.It will be observed that the &quot; weights &quot; adopted in order to arrive at a general average increase are proportional to pre-war ex-penditure. If a calculation is designed, as the present calculation is designed, to show the average increase in the cost of maintain-ing the pre-war standard of living, the &quot; weights &quot; to be applied to the percentage increases over the pre-war level must be based on pre-war expenditures. A simple arithmetical experiment will show that if the percentage increases which are to be averaged are percentages of the 1914 prices the correct result can only be obtained by using &quot; weights &quot; proportional to pre-war expenditures.(D). ITEMS NOT INCLUDED IN THE STATISTICS.The list of items included in the statistics is considered sufficiently extensive and representative to provide a sound basis for estimating the average increase in the cost of maintaining unchanged the pre-war standard of living of a working-class family. As regards items which are not included, it may be observed that they form in the aggregate only a small proportion of total working-class weekly expenditure, and that some have increased in price more, and others less than the average. It will be evident that if a particular item of expenditure had risen by about the same amount as the items included in the statistics, its omission or inclusion would have no effect on the general percentage, and that the omission of those minor items of expenditure which are not included in the calcula-tions would only become important if the average percentage rise in the price of the omitted items (taken together) were either very much below or very much above the general average. So far as can be judged, in the light of the information available to the Department, it as unlikely that the general average increase would be appreciably affected by the inclusion of a larger number of items, even if it were found practicable to extend the list.(9428-8)   Wt.27794-3007/2349  2500  3/31  P.
