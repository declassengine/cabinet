DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJES TY&apos; S GOVSRNjfU^ TJ .,T. COPY NO.ib(31)CABINET.AGRICULTURAL DEPRESSION IN SOUTH-EAST YORKSHIRMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture &quot;and Fisheries.&quot;I think my colleagues should see the appended copy of a Summary of the findings of the Permanent Commissioner of Crown Lands after a recent visit to the Crown Estates comprising 13,400 acres in the important arable district of S.E. Yorkshire.Mr. Gays adds to his report an account of the conditions on the individual farms and holdings which can be supplied if necessary.Both with regard to employment and the general condition of agriculture in these areas It provides abundant evidence of the need for special measures such as are indicated in my proposals for a wheat quota now before the Cabinet.(Intld.)      C.A.istry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 7th April, 1931i
Note of Visit of Permanent Commissioner of Crown Lands (Mr. A.S. Gaya, C.B., O.B.E.) with lr. P.C. Jonas to Sunk Island and Sr/ins Estates on 24th., 25th and 26 th :,!arch,  1931.The special purpose of this visit was  to meet the tenants with reference to the Petition which they had signed praying for a remission of fifty per cent, off their rents for the current year.      I v/as prepared to find things in a bad way but I was appalled  to see and hear evidence of agricultural depression far exceeding my werse anticipations .      It was heart-breaking work to call on tenant after tenant and hear the same story from them all,   that in this last year they had lost anything from  6  to  10 an acre on their corn crops, which are the mainstay *f farming in this district.      The Gazette price for wheat a fortnight ago was 22/2 a quarter, but as a matter of fact the price realised in this district has barely averaged 20/-Five years ago the price was 50/-,  and in the same period the price of bread has dropped from 10d. to 7d.,  and I was asked over and over again what was the reason for the disproportion in the fall of price for wneat and bread respectively.      I said that I could net answer this question.      One excellent tenant, whose father and grandfather v.&quot;era on the same farm before him, produced to me his Income Tax returns showing that the last year in which he made a profit was 1925,  and that his net loss fcr the ten years ending 5th April 1930 was  2,650.      His loss for the current year will probably bring it up to  3,500 at least.      I asked several of the tenants what they considered to be the lowest price at which tney could produce wheat without loss, taking all expenses into account.     One,  a smallholder, said 40/- a quarter, but he added that this was only possible by working like a slave himself and making his wife do likewise. He said that he envied the lot of the agricultural labourer with his minimum wage and his 5^ day week.      Tne.opinion of othertenants
JA 1 0tenants varied between 45/- and 50/-.One distressing result of the present depression is the diminution of labour employed on the farms and the consequent unemployment among the village inhabitants.      Several of the larger farmers are now employing two fewer men tnan they used to do and are doing those men&apos;s work themselves, wearing themselves out, on manual labour instead of using their time and energy for planning and directing the operations of L.he farm.      In this way they save perhaps  170 a-year, but still  the net loss on the sale of tneir produce continues and is bringing them to the verge of ruin.      Many,  I am afraid, ar*e selling hay and straw in order to meet their expenses, and they do so knowing full well that it is bad economy both for themselves and for the land.We already have nearly 5,000 acres in hand in this district and by the end of this week I expect to receive notices to quit in respect of some 2,000 acres more.     Unless tnere is a very great improvement in the conditions of arable farming during the coming year I fear that several more tenants will be so impoverished that we snail have no alternative but to release them from their tenancies.      I ought to add that, with one or two exceptions,  the tenants all received ma In the friendliest way and acknowledged that no one could expect more sympathetic treatment from a landlord than they received from the Grown.&quot;(Intld.)
