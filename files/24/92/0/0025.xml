flhia document is the prcperty of Hi&amp;Britanniff Majesty1y GrOV-rnraoni).CABINET,.OUT-OFORK DONATIONMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of labour.1, It is necessary to obtain an immediate decision withregard to the position as regards Out-of-Work Donation thatwill arise on 24th November next.   On that date the Out-of-^orkDonation Scheme for civilian workers comes to an end.   Thescheme, so far as ex*&apos;members of H,MV Forces are concerned,covers the year following personal demobilisation of theindividual (or the year fcilowing 25th November, 1918. inthe case of persons discharged from the Forces before thatdate), which may be termed for convenience the &quot;donation year&quot;of ex-service men.   It will therefore expire as regards acertain number of men on 24th November next; and as each weekpasses after that date the number of ex-service men who are nolonger covered by the scheme will increases2,   There Is nothing at present to tfeke the place ofdonation except (a) the unemployment benefit of V/- a week under tho Unemployment Insurance Acts covering some 5$- millionworkpeople altogether, and (b) trade union benefits, coveringperhaps from one to two million vrorkpeople outside those fallingunder the Unemployment Insurance Acts,3;   The proposals for extension of unemployment insurancewhich, are now under consideration&quot;cannot at best come into effective operation for six months or more after 24th November,,and. therefore cannot be of assistance for dealing with theposition at that date,4,   The total number of persons on donation or unemploymentbenefit just before the^railway strike was about 400,COd  (ofwhom 300,000r w^re^ex**sorvice men).   This total had been falling-pretty steadily week by week since the beginning of-May when the high water- mark of 1,110,000 on donation wasreached.   The railway strike greatly increased the number ondonation, but this accretion was temporary and the numbersdrawing donation or unemployment benefit are how at aboutthe same level as they were before the strike,5,   The number of ex-service men whose ftdonation year&quot; willhave expired will range from something approaching one million at the end of November, 1919, to two or two and a half million at the end of March, 1920,   On the average the weeklynumber of unemployed among these during the winter may) at a moderate estimate, be put at 100,000,   As regards civilians,it may reasonably be assumed that the average number unemployedeach week during the winter will not fall below that existingat present)1&apos;viz, 100)000 (65,000 men and 35,000 women,)&apos;6,   The courses that present themselves Eire three, either(a) to make no extension at all In the donationscheme,;(b) to extend it for ex-members of H.M,Forces only;(c) to extend it both for ox-memboro ol H,K,forces and for civilians.
7*   There is much to he said for making no extension at all.Any extensions means an addition to existing commitments and theneed for economy is imperativea   There is a widespread andlegitimate objection to the continuance of a system of &quot;doles&quot;.There is no evidence of any abnormal volume of unemployment and the need for removing all incentives to idleness isspecially great.8,   I was at first disposed to think that there would be agood case for!granting some extension of donation during thecoming winter in favour of ex-members of H;,M,Forces but nob infavour of civilian workers.   The proposal which I had in mind was that the period to be covered should he the four months from November 25th to March 24th, and that during the   period amaximum of 8 weeks1 donation mtqht be drawn at weekly rates of20/- for ex-service men and 15/- for ex-service women, withoutsupplementary allowance for dependants0..   9,   On further consideration, however,;I am doubtful&apos; whetherthis would be politic,   On social grounds there is some objectionto the perpetuation of the distinction between ex-service men andotherso   The preferential treatment of ex-service men in their&quot;donation year&quot; was justified; but if this preference is extended for a further period, it might be regarded as establishing a claim to such a preference for all future time    As regards the ,financial aspect of the matter, the danger is that, apart fromthe prospect of perpetuating the preferential treatment of ex-service men, the extension,, . if. given to- ex-service men only,could not be confined to the coming winter; il MgflS lead to a&apos;demand for a similar extension to all ex-service men whose&quot;donation year&quot; had expired and in effect to give them a donationpolicy covering (say) sixteen months from demobilisationinstead of the present twelve months; the effect would thenbe to increase the ultimate cost beyond what it would be if anextension, confined to the croMng winter, were granted both to ex-members of H.M. Forces and to civilians.   For these reasons it is difficult to give preferential treatment to ex-servicemen after&apos;.the end of their &quot;donation year&quot;,-The choice, therefore, is between granting an extension to ex-service men and civilian workers alike or granting no exten-sion at all,   My view after much hesitation is that no extensionshould.be granted,, and that, so far as donation is no longerpayable j, we should rely on the unemployment benefit of 7s payable to workpeople insured under the Unemployment Instance Acts,and on Trade Union benefits assisted by the subvention of one-sixth which is payable to the Trade Unions under Section 106 ofthe National Insurance ^ot  191Xo100   A different view is held by most of my advisers in theMinistry of Labour, who consider that an extension over thowinter should be granted both to ex-service men and to civilians,on grounds which may bo briefly summarised thus:-(a.)   The beginning of winter is an inopportune time forstopping donation even&apos; to civilians, who should therefore have the benefit,of an extension overthe four winter months 6.(b)   There will be strong labour objection to thetermination of the donation scheme at the end ofNovember,   This is plainly indicated in the JTadeUnion Memorandum presented to the ProvisionalJoint Committee of the Kahional Industrial. Conference,.. Section 5 of thieh, after making.proposals for a permanent scheme, states in .&quot;paragraph (h):-
&quot;Until this permanent provision is brought fully Intooperation it Will be essential to continue, at leaston the original scale, the temporary system ofunemployment donation instituted on the terminationof hostilities&quot;,(ci  The donation scheme was avowedly instituted as a &apos;-temporary measure pending the establishment of apermanent extended scheme of unemployment insuranceftThis permanent scheme is not yet ready, and it willbe objected with a good deal of force that:,, untilthe permanent scheme is ready, the interim provision should be kept in existence,   $his view wasreiterated by Mr, Henderson and Mr* dynes in theHouse of Commons in the last two days.The majority of my advisers,, in expressing these views, considered that the weekly rates of donationshould &quot;be reduced to 15/- for men and 12/- forwomen, but that in any event supplementary allowances for dependent children should not be given.   Theamo-unts ofi&amp;/- and 12/- obviously fall considerablyshort of a maintenance grant, but there is this to:be said in justification of &quot;them that (a) they arethe amounts recommended by the Aberconway Committeeof Inquiry into Out-of-Work Donation;&apos; (b) they are theamounts proposed for the contributory scheme ofwiemployment insurance now under consideration; and(c) they are at least as high as the amounts of strikepay commonly paid by Trade Unions,11, The following is an estimate of the cost of the various proposals) the estimate is necessarily rough as many assumptionshave to be made:-(i) Extension to ex-members of H,M,Forces at*      20/*- for men and 15/- for women -For 4 months from Nov. 25th, 1919  1,250,000&quot;     &quot;&apos;     11       in addition to donation     3,000,000year&apos; in all casesRepayments to Trade Unions under  150,000Section: 106 in respect of civiliansfor four months(ii) Extension to ex-members of H,M,forces and to Civilians for 4 winter months only at 80/* for men and 15/- for women   2,750,000at 15/- for men and 12/- for women   2,100,00012-, The question raised is largely a political one, and themembers of the Cabinet will no doubt be able to supplement thismemorandum from their own knowledge of the feeling in the country.It. is essential that an early decision should be given, not onlyin order to enable the Department to make its preparationsbefore November 24th, but in order that the policy of theGovernment, as to which enquiries are already being made, maybe defined, &quot; r.,GSD.)
