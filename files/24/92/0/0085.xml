[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]1. THE National or Constituent Assembly, having completed at Weimar itsprimary tasks of electing a provisional President of the new German Empire,^ and of passing a new Constitution, resumed on the 30th September, after a brief recess, itssittings in Berlin. It occupies the building of the former Reichstag, and has declareditself a substitute for the Imperial Parliament until a new Reichstag can be elected.The elections, it was expected, would take place next January, but it is now reportedthat they may be postponed till March or April.The National Assembly, the Imperial Government, and the nation face the coming winter with many anxieties. On the whole, domestic order has been restored, thanks to the vigorous policy of the Imperial War Minister, Noske, the services of the new national Volunteer Army (the &quot; Reichswehr &quot;), and also, perhaps, owing to a return on the- part of the great majority of the working classes to their naturalreasonableness. Haase, the leader of the Independent Socialists, is also reported .tohave condemned, at a recent conference of the party, the predictions of freshrevolutionary troubles which occasionally appear in the party press, and to have declared that the proletariat was at present exhausted, and that, although economictroubles might result in some renewal of revolutionary disturbance, there was noreason why the Independent Socialists should abandon their parliamentary campaign.Some even of the Communist (Spartacist) speakers denied that a further revolutionwas impending; while all that one of the chief disseminators of alarmist rumours, the editor of the &quot; Leipziger Volkszeitung &quot; ventured to assert was that a renewal of the troubles might be postponed for some time, but that the postponement would not befor decades.On the other hand, the Secret Service of the German Government is said to have secured plans of the fomenters of disturbance, and the Ministry is not entirelyreassured by the comparatively pacific utterances of the Independent leaders. Thereare still some centres of disorder which give special cause for anxiety. From time totime reports are received of the imminence of outbreaks in Munich and dusseldorf.2. The reorganisation of the German Army on completely unified and uniformlines has now been enacted and proclaimed. The War Ministers of Saxony,Wurtemberg, and Bavaria have vacated their posts, and Noske has been appointedsole Minister of National Defence for the whole of Germany, with supreme authority(subject to the President) over the entire Army and Navy. The new Army has been divided into four main groups or commands with their headquarters at Berlin, Kassel,Stettin, and Munich. Subordinate to the Berlin command is Dresden, and to theKassel command Stuttgart and Hanover arrangements which suffice to show howcomplete is the obliteration of State distinctions in the military sphere. the demobilisation of the old Army has proceeded with rapidity, notwithstanding state-ments, mostly of Polish origin, to the effect that it is still nearly a million strong andthat it could be re-mobilised in double that strength at short notice. According toNoske&apos;s last statement to the Budget Committee of the Reichstag, the strength is atpresent about 400,000 of whom 200,000 are in the interior and ^00,000 on or beyondthe Eastern frontier-but is rapidly diminishing.! The new Army, or &quot; Reichswehr,will, it is stated, consist of 20 brigades, i.e., 8,377 officers and 187,629 men, or,altogether, 19tt,006. It is noteworthy that the commands of 17 out of the 20 brigadesare concentrated in Prussian cities Berlin, Kassel, and Stettin.* The words &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Imperial&quot; are provisionally used to translate the word &quot;Reich.&quot; as a substantive and in composition; no other translation has yet been adopted,t Renter telegram in English press of October 2, 1919.CONFIDENTIAL.Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office,Geemany/040.MEMORANDUMonRMAN  GOVERNMENT  AND  ITS  MILITARY  FORCESIN  THE  INTERIOR.
3. If it be assumed that Noske is sincere both in his German republicanism andin his declared intention to carry out the terms of the Peace Treaty in the sphere ofthe Array, the question must still arise in view of various recent events,&apos; how far theWar Minister has the power to control the forces for which he is responsible. the answer depends, first upon the temper and political aspirations of the officers and troops at home, and, secondly, upon the attitude of the troops that are still employedbeyond the frontier, as in Courland, or in frontier districts whicK^re still German,such as parts of Prussian Poland, and in Upper Silesia. Noske has recently declaredthat the senior commands in the Army are all held by men who are loyal to himself as war Minister. It was no doubt true that some of the officers were Monarchists atheart. But if he had to choose between an efficient Monarchist who did his duty andan inefficient Republican he would appoint the Monarchist. It would, he added, be agreat mistake the mistake made by the French Revolution-to reject the services ofmen of the old regime who were willing to serve the new republican Empire.This policy of the Imperial Minister of Defence is naturally being attacked by theIndependent Socialists and also by the Majority organ, the &quot; Yorwarts.&quot; Its opponentsmanaged to score a point by publishing * an alleged interview with Colonel Keinhard,commanding the Infantry of the 15th Reichswehr Brigade. In this interview ColonelReinhard is reported to have said : &quot; I don&apos;t conceal the fact that I am a Monarchist; people like me cant turnRepublicans overnight. But don&apos;t be afraid; I consider it impossible to set upthe Monarchy again at present. The Entente alone would prevent us from doingthat. What may happen within the current year we none of us know. Naturally,such an Imperial or Royal regime as we had before the war wron&apos;t do hereafter,&apos; but a Democratic Monarchy is quite conceivable.&quot;Colonel Reinhard further indicated that he expected a renewal of internaldisturbances during the winter, and that the remedy would be a kind of civilian-military dictatorship in which, he admitted, the dictator would be &quot; a sort of Gallifet&quot;who would act as he, Reinhard, had acted in the labour troubles in Upper Silesia,where he had &quot;come down like a thunderstorm&quot; and had cut down a couple ofringleaders and ordained compulsory work. &quot;You should have seen,&quot; he said, &quot;how the workers all turned up next morning.&quot; Reinhard also seems to have spoken indisparaging terms of members of the present German Government.After an excited public discussion had been aroused by these utterances, thematter was taken up by the popular Committee (&quot; Yertrauensleute &quot;) of Reinhard&apos;sbrigade. They came to the conclusion that, if Reinfiard spoke as had been represented,it was in private and was due to his impetuous temperament and his temporaryirritation. &quot; His absolute trustworthiness in the service and his capacity had been sufficiently proved by his self-sacrificing and successful work in the sense of theGovernment.&quot; The Committee were unanimous in repelling the insinuation thatReinhard, as, indeed, he ,,himself emphatically denied, had indulged in any Royalistpropaganda.Reinhard had meanwhile written a letter to the Socialist &quot; Vorwarts,&quot; in whichhe repudiated the charge of Royalist agitation, but did not challenge statements about his private utterances, although he described the &quot; Weltbuhne &quot; interview as a pureinvention. The Socialists, except Noske, are still unsatisfied, but the matter appearsto rest there, and Reinhard continues at his post.4. Noske s own opinions on the domestic military situation have been repeatedlyexpressed in the National Assembly and in newspaper interviews.He recently saidt that many of his colleagues (presumably in the Government)were very anxious about the danger of a counter-revolution from the Right anddemanded that he should do more than he was doing to prevent it. But free speechwas a right secured by the Constitution. There would be intervention only wherepublic safety was unquestionably threatened, whether the menace came from the Rightor from the Left. He could safely assert that the senior commands in the Army were all held by men loyal to himself. On the other hand, it must be understood that many officers were discontented when they saw workmen earning more than full-paycaptains. He would remind those who criticised the Officers Compensation Law that men who left the Army with a morsel of bread to eat were not a danger to the Statelike men who suddenly had to face the world with nothing at all. Many people alsoforgot that the Army was now an army of mercenaries (&quot; Soldnerheer &quot;), and could not* In the Independent Socialist paper &quot; Weltbuhne &quot; of September 27.f See Weekly Intelligence Report: British Army on the Rhine.  Paper No. 135371, September 30,1919.
be treated in the same way as a conscript Army. He appealed to the Government toshow a little more determination and courage.So far as a comparison of different accounts, including private letters from Germany,can furnish any guidance, there is at the present moment more danger of a renewal ofisolated disturbances engineered by local Spartacists during the coming winter than ofan armed reactionary movement. It is certain that there will be much unemploymentowing to the very serious coal shortage and the great Jack of raw material. Therewill also be widespread distress owing to the high price of food and clothing. On theother hand, there are plenty of signs that the more impetuous reactionaries would consider such popular disturbances a pretext for demanding a military dictatorship,which they would hope to convert into an instrument of a royalist counter-revolution.General Malcolm in his reports lays stress upon the importance of giving the presentGerman Government such encouragement as can properly be given in its efforts to facethese dangers from the Left and from the Right. ^November 4, 1919.
