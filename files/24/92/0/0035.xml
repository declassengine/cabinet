3 t OR!&quot; T.Oil-Mi.) ,0, A B I N F T..AFFAIRS IP PFTROURAD&apos;.* E lg N&amp;val, Staff, Intel linnet Division;.(Circulated to the C&amp;bi n e t at the request of^thc  Firs\ LordoT&quot; Jih&amp; Admiralty.)        &quot;   &quot;In connection with the military disasters on the front the-political and economic situation hau become very much worse forthe Bolsheviks.   All their hopes of getting the harvest from the peasants:in return for manufactured goods hare &quot;been destroyed bythe action of General Mamontoff whose troops have seized all thegoods stored, near losoow and handed them out to the peasants.All the committees formed on the territory abandoned &quot;by admiral kolchak are unanimous in refusing to give food exceptingin return for manufactured goods in spite of all the appealsaddressed to them by the Central Pood Control.   Besides this thetransfer of food to the centres is becoming steadily more and moredifficult cwinv; to the cutting cf the railway lines by Mamontoff,and the extreme shortness of fuel supplies (Nikolai railway line -2 weeks supply), and the very small number of sound engines and railway cars (about 7o - BC% are out of order).Reserve food stores of the Military Commissariat inPetrograd on the 15th September wereFlour    *----none.Bu^ar    ----- 5200 pounds.gait----- 1700 ,   &quot;and nothing -mo re.At the various markets it is possible to buy food at thefollowing prices :-Meat     ........160 to 170 rbls. p. lb.Butter n-----400 -   450   &quot;       &quot;   . &quot;Plour   ........12c -   140   &quot;       &quot;     &quot;Onions   -......- 60 -. 100   &quot;       &quot;     &quot;Cereals ----- 120 -   130   &quot;    . &quot;     &quot;Tea   ----;------l50C - 2000   &quot;       &quot;     &quot;Eg jb     --------   30 rbls. apiece&apos;vegetables ----   20 - 25 rbls.     &quot; .   &quot;Su;-ar   ----400 rbls.. p. Ib.The possibility of buying produce in this way is explained by the fact that most of the shops cn the market are kept by thewives cf the militia whose duty it is to guard the market/In connection with the absence of proper food,  equipment and ammunition supplies the relation of the Red soldiers to theSoviet Government are beoomin.; worse and worse.   The only means bywhich the Soviet get anything done is terror, an excellent agitations-rvice and the indeolsion of the White troops opposing the red army. /      ,The sailors are mostly indifferent to political events,bein^ engrossed for thy most part in questions of pay and theformation of &quot;foraging parties&quot; into the country.
The- attitude uf the workers and of the whule popula-tion is e^trem- ly anti-Bolshevik.   The hi $her oircles of theSoviet Government, fully realising all these factors are fully aware- of the critical position in which they are now placed.The only move which will enable them to gain some sort ofbreathing-space, they consider, is the peace which they areoffering to their enemies at the present moment, at the same 6time they arc not very ,hopeful that their terms will beaccepted as they think that the enemy is probably well enoughinstructed.on conditions in Soviet Russia and the oircumstancesforoing the Bolsheviks to seek pease to fall into the trapprepared for them and let the Bolshevistic infection into their countries by their own act.The number of persons working in White organisationsis steadily diminishing, one reason for this being thesystem o.f terror which continues to be practised by theBolsheviks, and another - the bad organisation and inertnessof the White organisations working in Esthonia and Finland.The Petro^rad Organisations have long since drawn attentionto the necessity for more agitation on the part of the Whiteorganisations on the other side of the border, (particularly of throwing proclamations from aeroplanes); the greatnecessity for propaganda has now been understood also by themore responsible of the petrograd workmen, Red Army soldiersand sailors.The shooting of all the employees of the Red Govena-ment in yambourg and Olonetz has had a terrible effect onthe members of the White organisations in Petrograd, andhas caused a great number of leave for Denikin&apos;s front to try ana join Denikin, as they considered, not without reason,that in case Petrograd were taken, the sa; e thin.; might easily happen to them.All the workers in White organisations remaining inPetrograd earnestly request that the work of throwing downproclamations from aeroplanes may be taken up at once, andthat the work of those in the employ of the Red Governmentmav be looked into before they are shot, particularly as allreal Bolsheviks are already listed and will hardly be ableto esoa^e their fate if retribution is meted out in an organised and methodical manner.Report from S.T. 28 dated Helsingfors September 30th.Information has been reocivea from Petrograd froma very reliable source containing some interesting statisticslately compiled by the White Officer organisations uncer thedirection of the $rational 6entrc*   According to this infor-mation at&apos; the present moment thr Red Army is composed- as to7o^ of its total strength of men absolutely against Bolshevism;a further 2q% do not wish to fight on the one side or theother, and only 1Q% are in favour of the Soviet Government ofwhich 10$,only 5$ are communists proper.-
Tho fsoling.against tha Bolsheviks is tremendous;the working class -is being persecuted as severely as any.other.     Tho sender- of the information from Petrogradstates that ha himself saw a gro :p of about 500 arrestedled along the Ne-vsky in Petrograd of whom OOfi? wereworkmen,     The group&apos; was being convoyed by mounted Letts.The Chinese in the Red Army have refused to shootarrested men.&apos;   It is hot&quot; known, definitely whether thisrefusal is due to skilful,propagadda or whether a letterfrom the spiritual authorities in China has really beenreceived, &quot;but report states that the Dalai Llama hassent a letter forbidding t.he Chinese to shoot unarmedmen, and recalling his followers from Russia back totheir own country, and the fact remains.that&quot; the Chinesehave passed a resolution refusing to take part in theo :ecutions of arrested mem     i?or this reason therehave been fewer executions lately.In order, to save-, the situation the soviet authorities have formed a detachment of Bashkirs andKalmucks to the strength of about 1,500 man, whichdetachment has agreed to undertake the executionsordered by the Soviet and the guarding of all personsdirectly forming the:Soviet Government.     It was thisdetachment of 1,500 &quot;Red Bashkirs&quot; that Trotskythreatened to send against Finland, only he exaggeratedthe figure, stating th-1 it numbered 10,000 men.Naval Staff,Intelligence Division.31st October, 19h9./
