State for gar.The memorandum of tho Minis tor of Labour on thosubject of tho employment of ex-professional soldiers in the PostOffice, which it is understood is to come before the Cabinet t?asmorning, has only just been received in the &apos;7ar Office and the short time available does not admit of the preparation of a reasoned statement of the case against the proposal from thoT)&apos;ar Office point of view.In the circumstances the Secretary of state for T7arhopes that it may be possible to postpone the consideration ofthis question.In my case the Secretary of State desires to pointout to the Cabinet that one of the most important advantages heldout (with tho full concurrence of the Postmaster General) to would-be recruits before the war as an inducement to enlist wasthe promise that they would be given a preference in the case of50$ of the rest Office vacancies for postmen., sorters, &amp;c.,anUthat in order to soeuro recruits this promise was given verygroat prominence by recruiters and others and was well understood *throughout the Army.The Secretary of State dosires to point out that theRamsay Committee, an independent body charged with the duty ofmaking provision for the employment of ex-soldiers in government offices, after hearing evidence from the &quot;&apos;ar Office and the PostOffice held that it was not possible to break faith with theex-professional soldier on this point by swamping his olaimsamongst those of the much larger body of temporary soldiers whohave served in the war and the Secretary of State desires very strongly to urge this view on his colleagues.The Secretary of State also wishes to pross on theCabinet the importance in the interests of future recruiting of retaining the openings which have been available in thepast in the Post Office Service.(Sd) PEEL,for tho S.
