^ &quot;Agent reports that at Kagan on 13th October Pan-Islam and Bolshevikemissaries from Samarkand addressed meeting at railway station. Main line adoptedby speakers was as follows : Mahomedans are being oppressed and hemmed in onall sides by British Imperialists; Persia in particular was groaning under Britishtyranny. Persia food supplies were not only being eaten up by British but werebeing exported to India. Persian Governors and officials were selfish, corrupt,unpatriotic and in return for British gold were aiding British in crushing Persia.It was therefore duty of all true Mahomedans to go to aid of Persia. This will soon become possible. We have surrounded Krasdovodsk and with access to the caspian our way will soon be open. We may also certainly count on the activeassistance of the powerful State which has just wrung&apos; its independence from theBritish at point of the sword. All of us must co-operate and strain every nerve to destroy the British dominion in Asia. We must respond to the piteous appealswhich reach us from Mohomedan brothers in Persia and elsewhere. Such appealsmake no impression on the (? corrupt group) of the Amir of Bokhara, a contemptiblewreck (? who) pollutes his throne.&quot; 2. Speakers were paid agitators trained by Kazim Beg. Above is fair sampleof enemy propaganda which points more and more towards action in Persia. this may indeed become imperative because from. Persia alone can food supplies beobtained to mitigate famine conditions.&quot;r
