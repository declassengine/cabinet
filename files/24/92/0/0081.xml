IMPORTS &amp; EXPORTS (RB&amp;ULAHON,) BILLOn  October 33rd, 1919, the War Cabinet decided (WarCabinet 634 u.) ) to refer the Import and Exports (Rogula-tion) Bill (Gr/J!08389) for examination to the sameCommittee whioh had advised the Cabinet in August on thequestion of general trade policy and which was composed as follows-mis^note Committee have carefully considered each elauso oftho original draft of the Bill with the assistance of thodraughtsman, Mr. Graham-Harrison, and they now submit a revised draft   for tho consideration ef the Cabinet,She major points of difference between the rovisoddraft   and tho original draft (O.T.8S29) are as follows:-(l) The revised draft (Olatisel.) provides fer theconstitution of a &quot;Trade Reflation Committfje1&apos; of 17persons, 10 e^f who-^^re to oe Members of the Houseef Commons.    Any Oilers made under the Act by theBoard ef Trade in pursuance of the powers specifiedin Schedule 1. are only to be made after theCommitteo has approved the Orders in draft.   Thereis a proviso that the Board ef Trade may, enaoeeunt ef urgency or same ether special reason,make pre visional Orders for immediate operation.Such provisional Orders will, however, continue inforce fox 21 days only.She provision for the establishment of this Committeehas been, inserted in the Bill in order to placoto antagonismwhich exists in the House ef Commons to the continuation orextension ef the war powers of Government Departments.   TheTrade   Policy Committee consider that the Bill is more likelyto obtain 1he stipport ef the House if the executive,powers conferred by it on the Board of 2rado are subject to the supervision ef a body en whioh the Members of the Houseare: :ia a majority,\[Z\   Clause 15 of the old draft (0*2.8329) provided for thecontinuance in force, ibr a period ef threo years ef suchprohibitions or restrictions en expert as may operate when thewar ends.   It also provided that, during tho same period, &apos;the Beard of Trade might prohibit the exportation to any country or placeSir Auckland Oeddes (Chairman)Mr* Tames oLord.

specified in.the order &quot;of any articles of food or drink, anymaterials used in&apos;the manufacture or preparation of any sucharticle, any fuelJ or motor-spirit. Mother or not included  -in any such restriction or prohibition as aforesaid.&quot;HSie Committee foel that, in view of the urgent necessityof re-establishing the confidence of British exporters,it would be desirable to retain&apos; in force after the legal endof the war only such prohibitions as would have the general approval of the country, and that no powers should be left tdthe Board of Trade to add to these prohibitions. They have,therefore, re-drafted the Clause so&quot;as to provide that nro-nib it ions on export will continue in force only in the ease ofthe following articles, of which special mention is made inthe Bill:-Bullion and CoinFuel and Motor-spirit,MeatWheatSugarEdiule Fats.To&apos; this list it would have been necessary to add armsetc in view of our,obligations under tho Anns Traffic Con-vent ion, had it not been that power to nrohibit the exportof arms already exists under an Act of 1879.&quot;  &apos; tore remains one question of general policy which theCommittee agreed to leave to the decision of the Cabinet,without making any recommendation.Clause 2* sub-secUon (1) of the Bill reads as follows;&quot;The Board ah being satisfied -(a) That goods of any class or description pro-duced or manufactured in any country outside theUnited Kingdom are systeng. a cally and in sub-stantial quantities being imported into or being sold or offered for sale in the UnitedKingdom at prices below the foreign value as defined by this Act, or that there are goodgrounds for apprehending that such importation orsale is about to take placo; and(t)) that the production or manufacture of similargoods in the United Kingdom is or is,likely tobe thereby adversely affected,(may by orderapply this Part of th&amp; Act to goods of thatclass or description j; if imported from or ifmade or produce a im- any country  outside theUnited Kingdom or such country br countries as-      may be specified in the order, and either-withoutany limitation of time or for such period as maybe so specified, and either without any exceptionsor subject to such exceptions as my be so specified&quot;
This sub-section in its present iotffl covers thedumping of goods not only from foreign countries but fromBritish Dominions.    The Committee feel that tho retentionof this Clause raises a question of imperial policy whichthe Cabinet should decide.    It is not anticipated thatin the near future there will be any substantial dumping of goods from iminions other than Canada.    There is, however  a serious danger, in the case of Canada, of American capital establishingworks in the Dominion and using the output of these works to crush industries in this country.     There is also &apos;a danger that American goods may be exported to Canada, forfurther manufacture in the Dominion, and thence dumped in theUnited Kingdom.    If the prosperity of British industries were the sole factor to be taken into consideration, theCommittee feel that it would be essential to take powers toprevent American dumping: from Canada.   The political effectof legislating against  (kmdian imports must however,be borne in mind..      Since, the Bill was considered by.the Committee it hasbeen Drought to ray notice that Sis Majesty sGovernment are under obligations&quot; in accordance with the Opium Convention tomaintain a control ovor the exports of the following:-Opium and its preparations.Opium alkaloids and their salts and preparationsCocaine and its salts and preparations.These articles I have consequently added to the listin Section 9.A C  G.Nov. 6th 1919./
