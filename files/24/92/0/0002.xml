M^tOHAIQULi .vY        MIWIuTEIJX O,:1 IMUlIIVIOHb.In Juno last I circulated to the War cabinet a Report of the nitrogen ?r 6 due to Coiraalfctfcb of the Mv.nit.ionsInvent ions Department toolbar with a IVkq.c:-i?A-cm containing the saliont features of the Reoort - Q/l1. 74-66,I now circulate a Memorandum-setting forth theactual financial position of 1LM. nitrogen factory,Billingham-on-Tees, which was in process of erection at thedate of the Armistice, and particulars of an offer to pur-chase the undertaking received from Messrs.: Brunner Mond &amp;Co., acting on behalf of a Syndicate.I consider that the offer affords a reasonablebasis for negotiation, though the monetary payment offered by the Syndicate is in my opinion too small.   But havingregard to all the circumstances, I think it unlikely thata better offer would be forthcoming from any other commercialbody in a position to carry out the Governments original intention in promoting the Billingham scheme of making thiscountry independent of the importation of Chilian nitrates.In order, however, to prevent criticism on theground that the Government are handing over exclusive inform-ation to a particular group of manufacturers, and are ciispos-ing of valuable property without any prior public announcementof their intention to do so, I propose at once to publish
the Report of the Nitrogen products Committee, and atthe sane time to announce publicly that the Billirniiamsito is available for disposal for the production of synthetic ammonia by private enterprise.As the Syndicate expect an early decision,I wish to obtain immediate Cabinet ao&apos;oroval for oontin-uing negotiations with them, with a view to obtainingmore favourable terms, and for concluding the sale;subject to Treasury sanction, unless within a month ofthe public announcement a bettor offer is receivedfrom some other commercial body of recognised standing;27th October, 1919, IMERFQRTH.
DISPOSAL   OP   H.M.   UITR0G3N   ?AC^OKY, 3ILLIliOHALI-ON-&apos;i!3I3S.Tlio Minister of Munitions received sanctionon March 22nd 1913 to proceed with the erection of a factory at Billin^haiii-on-&apos;j? e e 3 for the production on alarge scale of Nitrogen from the atmosphere, and ofHydrogen: and for combining tho Nitrogen and Hydrogenso obtained for the production of Ammonium Nitrate tothe ultimate extent of 60,000 tons per annum.   Thetotal estimated expenditure was approximately  4,000,000.!I&apos;he shortage of labour and building materialsduring last year militated against speedy progress beingmade with oho erection of the factory as a war measure.With the conclusion of hostilities consideration wasgiven to the scheme as a post war measure, and from thispoint of view, the Minister was advised that many por-tions of the scheme would require redesigning.   Further,the information obtained by the two expert Missions,which have since the Armistice visited chemical wortsin the German occupied area, has emphasized the necessityof revising the scheme first adopted.The construction work on the- factory has accordingly been discontinued,.and pending a decision(S)
as to the future of the scheme, contracts for machinery and plant have been suspended; steps have been taken to dispose of surplus bricks, timber, etc., not immediatelyrequired and only a maintenance staff has been retainedon the site.(2)   COETOITS IHCURIOi) 31 !fIIS MlfflbTHY Qli Tlig SC&amp;ftH ri&apos;0 DATE.l&apos;he following figures show the approximate totalcommitments of the Ministry on the scheme to October,1919,so far as can at present be ascertained . h   Plant Orders (including amounts paid for cancellations) ...     ...     591, 000l.-Wages, Materials, Stores, Admini3tra-tivo Expenses, etc....     ...    280, 000k   Buildings (permanent and temporary) 94, 000x   Railways ...     ... .... 25, 000k   Roads ...... ... 4, 900s  Water Supply and Water Works        ... 14, 0001,008,900Gravel Pit ....     ......     ... 1,100land (not yet purchased) (about) 60,000Electric Power Agreement with theHewcastle-on-Tyne Electric PowerSupply Co.Amount paid    130,000To be paid      150,000 230,000      391,100 1,400,000(3) PROPOSALS AS R3GA5DS TH.3 FJTUHE Off THE SCHEME. ^By an arrangement which Lord Moulton initiated,Messrs. Brunner Mond &amp; Co. undertook to ascertain whether a combination or Syndicate could be formed to take over thex The items marked with an asterisk are included in the offer which has been made by Messrs. Brunner ilond &amp; Co., referredto in paragraph 3 (b)..
3llXin;?ham scheme.   They have notified the Ministry thata strong combination could be formed consisting of them-selves and the Companies connected with them ( such asCastner-Kellner Company. Oroosfields, Chance &amp; aunt) andthe Explosives Trade Liautod, which includes Rebels andall the other Explosives manufacturers.   Also that thisSyndicate is prepared to purchase tho original site of thefactory (consisting of approximately 271 acres) togetherwith all the buildings, plant, machinery, railway sidings,stores, etc., on the following   terms(a) The Syndicate to buy at the actual cost to the-Ministry, all the land forming part of the originalsite,, wayleaves and facilities connected therewith,,gravel pit and such additional.land as they requireand as thff Ministry can secure within the limits of statutory powers or by negotiation on behalf ofthe Syndicate.(b) The Syndicate to purchase everything on the site,which it is in the power of the Ministry to dispose of, including buildings,,roads, railways, stores,plant, etc.,.and also all goods still to be deliveredon existing contracts, with such benefits attaching to them as the ministry may possess, at a figure tobe definitely agreed upon between the technical ex-perts of the Ministry and the Company.The provisional   offer made by Messrs. BrunnerMond &amp; Co.. under this heading totals  427,600.   this offer oovers the items of expenditure marked with anasterisk in paragraph 2, on which the present commit-ments of the Ministry amount to  1,008,900.   The dfferis not considered adequate, even after making allowance
for the fact that a considerable portion of thooriginal scheme will need to be scrappo:;.   If,therefore, the matter is to be pursued further thetechnical experts on both sides will need to ox-a mine the details of the offor made by the firmin the light of the actual cost of the various items to the Government.   It is probable that &apos;the Syndicate would be prepared to take over theGovernments liabilities .in respect of the EleotricPower Agreement, and a definite statement from theSyndicate on this point is expeoted shortly,The main object of the Syndicate is to produceammonia synthetically on a large commercial scale for themanufacture of fertilisers.   But, as a condition of thesale to them of the factory, they are prepared to providethe plant sufficient for the sroduction of a minimum outputof 20 tons of ammonia per day, and for its conversion into nitric acid for explosives purposes through ExplosivesTrade,Ltd.(4) HEPOMMEMDATIONS.On the assumption that the princiole is accepted-that the future development of this scheme should be leftto a Commercial undertaking, subject to the Governmentinterests in the production of nitric acid for serviceexplosives being safeguarded, the approval of the cabinet is sought to the following course of action       --(a)    That negotiations with the Brunner Mond Syndicatebe pursued on the lines indicated above, with the^object of obtaining an increased monetary payment,subject to the approval of the Treasury as to the)( precise terms, and a satisfactory arrangement being reached as regards the Electric Power Agreement.
r    (b)   That the fact that the Billin;ham Factory siteis available for disposal, for the production of synthetic ammonia by private enterprise, be pub-licly announced forthwith.   Such&apos;a course wouldobviate any adverse criticism at a later date from other commercial firms who might be interested.(c)   That the report of the Nitrogen Products Committeebe published at once.   The question of publishinginformation as to the two Chemical Jvlissions toGermany requires further consideration.(d) That the Minister of Munitions be authorised to disclose to British Chemical Manufacturers suchsecret processes patented by the Department daringthe war as may be considered of valve to the chemical Industry of the country.There remain for consideration two further questions, viz:-. (e)   The exact form of agreement to be entered intobetween the Government and the Syndicate, so as toensure that the Government&apos;s requirements forNitric Acid, nitrate of Ammonia and other Nitratesfor Service Explosives can be adequately met, theultimate aim boin* that this country should eventually be independent of supplies of nitrates from Chili,(fJ future research work on the nitrogen problem, includingprivileges under tne Treaty..As regards (e), it may be considered sufficientif the Government are assured by the terms of the agreement that a definite output of nitric acid will bo available assoon as possible, and have a lien on the Syndicatedmanufacturing capacity in the event of a national emergency.
As regards (f), it is suggested that thisquestion might he referred to a suitable Committeefor consideration, as thoro are various directions in which research work on the llitrogon problem could be pursued with advantage, independently ofthe Trade.
