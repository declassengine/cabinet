Secretary.g, 7/hitehall Gardens, S. 17.1. -11th November, 1919.A SUGGESTED PERMANENT ORGANIZATION FOR MEETING STRIKES.Memorandum by the Chairman cf the Supply and transport committee of the cabinet general. 1;     Ify Committee at tJteirmociting on the 31st -October,1919, disenssod inter alia a variety of questions whichhad been submitto8 to thorn by their Sub-Oommitteo.   Themost important of these questions is whether the Govern-ment should take steps to establish a semi-permanentorganization to meet &quot;future strikes, by railway ortransport workers - or by both combined - on an extensive scale.   My Committee are of opinion that this is amatter which Is not within their competence to decide,and I accordingly submit it for tho Cabinet&apos;s considora-tion at an early date.
The organisation, if approved, would have to be of considerable size. It would involve the enrolment, and, possibly, the training of volunteers, such as signalmen, omnibus drivers, conductors, and lorry drivers, in their duties for a short period.

It would also involve the provision of material and accommodation beforehand for the use of such volunteers when the strike took place. 2 The numbers which would be required cannot be estimated, but that they would be very large, is clear from the fact that a general transport strike would necessitate the provisioning of workers for railways; for public conveyances, and for the other transport services of the country, as well as for the special transport service of the Ministry of Food; - and the longer the strike continued the greater would be the need for volunteers. I am informed that in the case of London at least 3,000 volunteers would be required as a nucleus for working the emergency passenger service arrangements. There are, moreover, other services besides transport for which volunteers should be enrolled, eg . for the maintenance of communication by means of wireless and motor cycles. 

The question of the enrolment of volunteers was discussed by the Supply and Transport Committee, and while there was no unanimity of opinion as to what action should be taken, it was generally felt that the enrolment of volunteers would at once lead to trouble with Labour. In favour of enrolment it may be urged that in the next strike the Trade Unions will themselves be more prepared, and will assume that the Government are prepared. They will therefore probably act with more precipitancy and on a wider scale, and the taking of immediate stops by the Government may make all the difference between success and failure. Moreover, previous enrolment would enable the Departments concerned to call up volunteers for the service to which they are specially fitted.


On the other hand, the objections to the enrolment of volunteers are obvious. Such enrolment could not be concealed from the Trade Unions, who would at once protest vehemently against a Government organisation for "strike-breaking", as they would term it. They might even precipitate a strike on this ground alone, and it is not certain that public opinion would be favourable to deliberate preparations by the Government for industrial war during a period of what is superficially one of industrial peace. 

PROVISION OF EQUIPMENT.

3. If the Cabinet decide to establish the organisation described above, steps should be taken not only to enrol volunteers but also to provide the necessary equipment. In fact, it is a matter for consideration whether such equipment should not be provided now, even if it is considered inadvisable to enrol volunteers. The position at the present moment is that the Government is still in possession of great quantities of stores which are essential during war and during industrial crises, but which are not required by the Services during peace. These stores either have been or are on the point of being declared surplus, and in a few weeks, or at the outside a few months, they will have disappeared. Examples of such stores are bedding and tents, electric lighting sets, ambulances and medical appliances, motor lorries and cycles, wireless and signal stores, and portable generating sets. Such articles would be of very great value during a large strike, but could not be provided without previous preparation. I cannot but feel that it would be both wise and economical to retain from disposal sufficient quantities of such goods to provide the necessary equipment for an organisation to meet strikes, whether the personnel of such an organisation is prepared beforehand or is improvised at the time of a strike. To do so, however means money, and I shall refer to this side of the question later. 
4,     There! is another point on *.&apos;hieh I should b- glad ofthe opinion of the C hinet.   rhen peace ia declared thepowers Rf Government Departments to oommande-r buildings and goods *iUi Generally speaking, cease to exist.Accommodation for volunteers -;ould have to be provided inan; large strike, and while this could be ear-marked In aadvance by private arrangement in a limited number ofoases, as a general rule such accommodation could onlybe obtained by commandeering.-   I have consulted the attorney general on this question (Appendix ),s and he approves thesuggestion that a draft Bill should be prepared beforehandgiving powers to the Government to commandeer buildings, and necessary articles such as canal boats, and equipment forcanal boats.   It must.be borne in mind, however, that astrike may occur - as the last strike did- during theparliamentary recess $ and in this event the Attorney--Genial&apos;opinion Is that the Government should take all necessary steps vhe,n the emergency arises and rely on a subsequentAct of Indemr.ity,   This m-ans the Government c^^mnltting a technical illegality &quot;hioh &quot;ould. not be lost sijht of hy theTrade Unions in or after the dispute.   It might lead toother breached of the law.5.     1 have already stated that the establishment ofa permanent organization must involve considerable expenditure, and the allocation of public funds for thixpurpose *ould be sure to raise a storm of protest fmmcertain sections in Parliament .and. in the Press.   Theonly way thereby criticism and opposition might beobviated *ould be to include such expenditure in the secret Service Vote,   I offer no opinion in this questionbut submit it for my colleagues consideration.6,    To sum up; the dicision of the Cabinet is invited onthe following points.:(a)   Whether It is desirable to organise and train avolunteer sv-.ff brf-rehand for essential services
(b) Whether equipment for such a staff should beprovided no*;- even if it is decided not toenrol or train a staff beforehand.   If theddcision is in the affirmative, the Cabinet is asked to sanction the expenditure involved andto instruct the Minister of Munitions to retainfrom disposal such stores as m*ry be considered necessary by the Departments concerned *   In this event, some financial authority must be soughtor devised.(c) Whether a draft Bill giving, powers to thethe Government to commandeer should be prepared and introduced at once, or kept in readiness for use when required,(d) Whether in the event of a strike taking place during the Parliamentary reoess the Governmentshould rely on obtaining a subsequent Actftf Indemnity..(Intd.)

APPENDIX.SECRET.gab i.het,* SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT CCItlMITTBE. *29th October. 1919.Dear Sir Gordon &amp;ew*&amp;with the Minister of Transport., as Chairman of the above CabinetCommittee, has asked me to obtain your opinion and advice on thefollowing situation:-As you may be aware, the machinery used during the last strikefor maintaining public service and supplying food is being examined in the light of the experience gained, from the strike, and an attempt is being made to maintain an improved skeleton organisation which willbe ready to operate at a moment*s notice should another strike of equalmagnitude occur.   It seems to be generally agreed that when the Defenceof the Realm Regulations cease to&apos;be operative, Government departments will be powerless to take action which will be urgently necessary,suoh as -(1)   Retaining from disposal surplus stores,e.g. blankets, lorries etc.(2)   Commandeering premises required for the housingof Volunteers or emergency organisations,commandeering road transport vehicles, canal boats,or any other articles required by the Government.I understand from Sir Frederick Llddell that the. Emergency Laws(Continuance) Bill will not provide for the continuance of any powersto commmdeer, except in the case of buildings required for Pensionspurposes, and Sir Eric Ge&amp;des has asked me to say tht-t he would bevery glad of your opinion as to the means by which such powers couldbe retained.   If you consider that legislation would be impracticableat the -^resent time, would it be advisable to have ready a draft bill which oould be 1?id before. Parliament when the emergency occurs?There are two other similar points on which Sir Eric would beglad to hnve Jrour advice, namely (1) the restriction of the telephone service, and U) the extension of powers of the London Policc:As regards (1) during the strike the G.P.O. were prepared todisconnect all telephone subscribers except those with whom it wasnecessary for Government Departments to maintain&apos; communication.   Thequestion is whether, had such action been taken, the subscribers wouldhave had a right to proceed against the Government in the Courts andto claim damages.Ac regards (2) it is considered desirable that the Police shouldhsve power, during a strike, to regulate queues, to divert to other roadsspecific classes of traffic, to order the clearance of road making materials likely to cause obstruction, and to throw open private roadsto traffic.   Would it be possible, in your opinion, to provide those powers in the emergency legislation which I have referred to above, orcan you suggest any better method?The Committee appointed to consider these questions is meetingtt 5.0p.m. on Friday next, end I should be very grateful if you could^possibly let me have an answer some time on Friday morning.  1Yours very truly,(Sgd)   L. STORR,   .   *Lieut.Col.Secretary, Supply and transport committee of the Cabinet.^Hon.Sir Gordon Hewart, E..C.,M.P.Attorney-General,Royal Courts of Justice,W.C.E.
Attorney General.4th November, -1919uDea  Colonel Storr,With reference to your letter, I think the suggestion tohave- ready a drai?t &quot;&quot;ill which could be laid before Parliamentwhen the emergency arises, a good one.     The only alternative(in the absence of legislation) would seem to be that theGovernment should take all the steps considered necessary whenthe emergency arises, and, reply on a subsequent Act of Indemnitybeing passed making such steps legal exjDOst facto, end I think there can be no doubt that it would be&quot;&apos;pre e&quot;raDle to have adraft Bill, giving the necessnry powers, readyAs to the- subsidiary questions(1)   I think the subscribers would, in the case put,have had a right to proceed in the Courts for damagesfor breach of contract.(2)   It is possible and advisable to provide the powersreferred to in the draft Bill proposed.    (The Met-ropolitan Police have various statutory powers as tothe regulation of traffio, but they are not so wideas those proposed.))Yours very truly,(Signed)   GORDON KBWART.Lieut. Cola Storr, C.B.
