kS DOCmCTT IS TIF PROPERTY CF HIS BKIT\NNIC M;&apos;vJ^r-,TY3^n^Pffvl)EC RET,C A B I N 13 T ,.1 QUT-OF-^CRK DONATION.SMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:.When considering Mr, Fisher&apos;s proposal to confine theextension of out-of-work donation to ex-service men and todeal with the dockyards on the lines suggested by the FirstLord, I beg my colleagues to bear in mine the following facts:-(l) The general grant of out-of-work donation createsan atmosphere in which no-one is willing to help the Exchequer.(2) The justification for the institution of the universalout-of-work donation was the existence cf a national emergency.There is now no national emergency.(3) There is a local emergency in the dockyard portsbut the local emergency would, rot be met by the general ex-tension of out-of-work donation-(4) The policy of the Labour Party is to make unemploy-ment a permanent charge upon the State upon which they wouldfix the responsibility for providing wovtyih:national workshopsor providing pay for the out-of-works.   The universal extensionof the: out-of-work conation would play straight into their hands.(5) The policy of the Government is to promote a schemeof national contributory unemployment insurance-   To this the Labour Party are absolutely   opposed, and their constituentswill only be brought to consent to it if no other means Ofdealing with unemployment is in existence.(6) Mr. Fisher&apos;s proposal is supported by the Ministerof Labour.I believe that none of my colleagJ.es would denythat this   is and accurate statement cf fact.   At this stageI do not wish to add to the argument but only to recall thefacts.(Initialled)   A.C.jury,  s.W\th November, 1919.
