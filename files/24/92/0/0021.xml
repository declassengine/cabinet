JL20.THE SALARY OP THE S &quot;OpTfRY J:&apos;CR SCOTLAND.ppP.J-._Pr_ L letter from tho Scottish Chamber of agriculture to the Prime&quot; Minis to:Scottish Chamber of Agriculture,18, Duke Street.Edinburgh,,18th Ootober, 1919.The Rt.Hon0P-,Lloyd George, oai.,M,P.,Prime Minister.Sir,At a Meeting of the Directors of this Chamber held on  1stultc we wore instructed to inform you that the Directors are highly&quot;gratified with tho proposal of the Government to make the Secretaryfor Scotland, one of His Majesty&apos;&apos;s principal Secretaries of State with cabinet rank.. They trust you will give this proposal your active support.As we ero writing on this subject, we take the liberty of expressing our personal views with reference to the salary of Mr-Munro*   He was Lord Advocate receiving  5,.000 a year and agreed.because it was considered in the national interest, to accept offioeas Secretary for Scotland to which the smaller salary of &amp;B,000 isattached,   In doing, this he also cut himself off from practice inhis profession and thus sacrificed tho largo income to which hisabilities and groat experience would have entitled him.   This smallsalary is beyond Question out of all proportion to the importance oftho office and the vnluo to the State of Mr. Ivinnro&apos;s services-   since it was fixed, many years ago, tho importance and duties of the office have increased enormously in many directions.   By way of illustration,it may bo mentioned that the administration of the Agriculturalaffairs of Scotland was only placed under the Secretary for Scotlandso recently as 1911.    His present salary ( 2,000) is also outof proportion to the salaries of other public servants (whoseofficial superior no is), including -Salary:,President of the Court of Sosaion...... 5&quot;., 000lord Justice Clerk. ....,*..** n.............  4.;6G0Lor d acivocato * *...  ......... ^............. u  5 5 000lord Ordinary of the Court of Session,,.....  3,600It should be pointed out that Mr.Munro in his zealous attentionto his duties finds it necessary to travel constantly - practicallyevery week - between London and Edinburgh and other places inScotland *   For travelling and other expenses ho must spend a largesum, probably not loss than  500 a year.   He gots no allowance forthis,&quot;which, we understand, has to conio out of his salarye   He is thus in a worse position than even the Chairman of tho national health Insurance Commission (Scotland) who is paid  1,800 a year.Mr.Munro is at tho head of practically the whole administrative^    work of Scotland, including Agriculture, Education, Local Government,Fisheries, &amp;o,. and it is only by rare diligence and ability andaptitude for work and a combination of the best qualities of sbeies-manship that he has given practically universal satisfaction.-.   the directors having had fr.oonent opportunities of meeting wi &amp; Lrr Jtoroand observing his actions in relation to agricultural interests, feel bound to acknowledge tho&apos; success and greet value of his services.
In these ciroumstances, we trust you may see your way tosupport the proposal for giving an appropriate salary to theSecretary for Scotland in his proposed hew office of secretary of State.   That wouia he no more than an act of justice to scotland.!7e are,Sir,Your most obedient Servants,fSd) GEO. A. FERGUSOH,      President.(Sd) ISAAO ComiL, Secretary
