PARAPHRASE T2L&quot;G3AL from the Secretary of State for the.*$ Lies to the Governor General of Canada.our telegram(Sent3,30 p.m. 28th October, 1919)3rd October. Proposal of your Ministershas been most carefully considered by Cabinet.   We Recognisefully that demand for distinctive representation of canadian  His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Washington is justified by im-portance of Canadian business at &apos;Fashir,ton and closeness of relationship between States and Canada.   At the same time -wecordially reciprocate your desire that such distinctiverepresentation should take a form which would maintain and em-phasize solidarity of Empire and provide well balanced protec-tion of   Canadian and Imperial interests in United States.We think it very desirable from this point of view to se-cure the position of the representative of Canada as part of establishment of Eimbassy, and to preserve closest connection between him and Ambassador,  so that there may be constant inter-change of views on matters of common concern.The most convenient and suitable method of carrying out this object would be in our opinion for Government of Canada torecommend and for His Majesty to appoint a minister who would be next in rank in &quot;Srnbassy to the ambassador, and have charge of Canadian affairs end conductthem with the Government of United States acting upon instruc-tions from, and reporting direct to Government of Canada.   Heshould take his pla.ee at the Embassy as minister in charge of canadian affairs, and Government of United States should be formally apprised of his appointment by official letter from secretary of State accrediting Canadian kinister and e-mpower-ing him to conduct Canadian affairs with Government of theUnited
United States direct.   In absence of Ambassador Embassy would bein charge of Canadian Minister.   Solidarity of Empire would inthis way be maintained and emphasised, which could hardly be thecase if diplomatic agent for the Dominion of Canada wereaccredited to President of United States independently.It would be essential in order to carry out this policy thatMinister should reside at and have his office within precincts ofEmbassy, and that his Canadian staff, appointed like himself onthe recommendation of the Government of Canada, should havediplomatic status and be regarded as part of diplomatic staffof His Majesty1 s j^mbassy with rank equivalent to that of theirBritish colleagues cf corresponding grades.   It will benecessary to find another site upon which suitable buildingscan be raised as the present Embassy House is inadequate for thepurpose.We confidently hope that above proposals will meet theviews of Dominion Government,   Should however experience shownecessity for further modifications to meet altered conditions and new status of Dominions, there will bo an opportunity for full discussion of this subject at the contemplated conference to be held next year on the constitution of the Empire,ileanwhile a beginning could at once be ma.de by establishment of canadian branch of hmbassy at Washington as above suggested.lilLNER.28,10. 19,
