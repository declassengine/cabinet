Tho Cabinet Committee appointed to make proposalsfor dealing with tho Irish question hare made considerable progress with their tvsk.   They have not jtet examined itsfinp.noial fe.ia1Jwas - but bafoio entering upon this questionf,nd on matters of detail they mo anxious to know whetherthe Cabinet will approve of the fundamental basis of thosohemo on -which they themselves are now agreed.*2.        The Committee are agreed that in view of the situation .in Ireland itsolf, of public opinion in Groat Britain and still more of public opinion in tho Dominions and tho United *    ]States of America, they cannot recommend tho policy either of repealing or of postponing the Home Rule Act of 1914.

When the Committee came to consider the problem ofdealing with the demand for Home Rule in Ireland in its practical aspects they found themselves limited in twodirections.     On the one hand, the Government was committed8&amp;einat any solution which would break up the unity cf theEmpire.   On the other, it was committed that Ulster must notbe forced under the rule of an Irish Parliament against it will.   Tho first condition, therefore, excludes anyproposal for allowing Ireland or any part of Ireland toestablish an independent republic,   the second precludesthem from again attempting what has so often foiled in thepest, the establishment by the action of tho imperial parliament of a single Parliament for sll Ireland on thelines of the Home Rule Acts of 1886, 1892 and 1914.4.        After some preliminary discussion it appeared tothe Committee that there wore three possible coursesbefore them:(a) The first was to establish a Home Rule Parliament for11 Ireland, and providing for the exclusion of some part of Ulster   either by the clean cut, or by allowing the people of Ulster to vote themselvesout by county option or some system of plebiscite:(b) The second was to create a single Parliament for ireland, but to secure Ulster against forcedDublin control, oitlier by the constitution of anUlster Committee within that Parliament possessed of veto powers so far as the application of Irishlegislation and administration to Ulster was   1concerned, or by the artificial over-representa-tion of Ulster in the Irish Parliament on thelines suggested by a considerable section of the
Irish Convention of 1918..(o)   Tho third wws to establish ono parliament for the throo Southern provinces and a secondparliament for Ulster, together with a Councilof Ireland composed of members of tho twoIrish Parliaments, to discharge certain,immediate functions, but mainly to promoteas   rapidly as possible, snd without furtherreferenco to tho Imperial Parliament the unionof tho whole of Ireland under a singlolegislature.5.        So :&apos;ar as tho first of these alternatives is con-cerned tho Committoo ,as in some doubt ps to whether inview of the Government election declaration of November22nd 1918 the policy of exclusion by plobisoito or countyoption was possible for the present Government.   that declaration reads as follows&quot;We re^s-rd it was one of tho first obligations of British statesmanship to explore all practicalpaths towards tho settlement of this grave and difficult question,, on the basis of self-govern-inent.   But there are two paths which aro closed - theone leading to a complete severance of Ireland fromthe British Empire, ?nd the other to tho forciblesubmission of the six counties of Ulster to aHome Rule Parliament $gainst thoir will.    In im-posing these two limitations, wo are only acting in accordance with tho declared views of allEnglish political leaders.&quot;6.        Aaart, however, from this consideration theCom ittoe decided against the policy of exclusion onits merits.   If the policy of exclusion is to bo basedupon county option or some form of plobiscito, it is open to the following objections,   firstly, that theeroa which would probably thus be excluded would almost certainly be administratively unworkable.   Secondly,that if an election or plebiscite were fought on the issueo,,&apos; o elusion it would infallibly inflame religious andpolitical passion in Ireland and do more to partitionIreland in spirit end temper ?jnd hinder eventual Irishunity than any separation imposed from outside e^uid do.Thirdly, tnat it would divide Ireland on purelyreligious lines.   On tho other hand, if the policy ofexclusion is applied to tho six counties or the wholeprovince of Ulster it would leave large nationalistmajorities under British rule,, which would clearly infringethe principle of self-determination,   finally, thepolicy of exclusion is open to one general objectionof the most serious Kind.   It involves the retentionof British rule in some part of Ireland.   There is good reason to doubt whether it would over be possibleto convince Irishmen themselves or Dominion or American opinion that Groat Britain was sincere in its policy ofHome Rule unices it withdraws its control from tho domcstioaffairs of Ireland altogether.   British rule in thodomestic affairs of Ireland has been the root of the home rule movement from start to finish.    If it is retained,anywhere in Ireland the opponents of Great Britain will beable to say either that Great Britain is ruling nationalistmajorities -gainst their will, or that it is giving itsactive support to Ulstez in its refusal to unite with stherest of Ireland.
7.    J.3 rshards tho second oi&apos; the alternatives, theCommittee wore exceedingly doubtful whether it could be reconciled with the Prime Minister1s undertaking notto coorco Ulster under the rule of an Irish Parliament,On this point they would like his ruling.     But in any event they decided against this plan,     Tho proposalfor the constitution of an Ulster Committoo within an irish Parliament possessod of veto powers over Irishlegislation and administration in so far as Ulster was concerned, was worked out last year in a Draft Billknown as Bill B.     Tho Committee are satisfied thatthis proposal would prove qnito unworkable in practice,oven if the population of Ulster would accept it asbeing within the Prime ministers pledge.     It wouldenable the Ulster Committee to block and stultify thework of the Irish Government and Parliament, withoutenabling it to develop Ulster itself according to thoideas of the Ulster people.     Similarly the Committeeare opposed to tho proposal for the artificial over-representation of Ulster in an Irish Parliament.     Theydo not be]ieve that such proposals could survive parlia-mentary ojl; public criticism in view of the groat advanceof democratic sentiment and praotice sinoe 1914.     nor do they think the method of allowing a minority to ovor-ride or blook the will of a majority oould really promoteharmony and good will in the actual working of an allIreland parliament,8.    Both these expedients for achieving Irish unity are,,in the opinion of the Committee vitiated by the samedefect.     Th9y assume that it is within the power of theImperial Parliament to impose unity on Ireland.    That isonly true if the Act of Union is maintained in itsentirety.    The Imperial Parliament can compel Irishmen to govern themselves by the simple expedient of withdrawingits own officials.    But once it gives Ireland self-government it cannot compel Irishmen to unite.     Irishunity can then only come from unity in Ireland itself.9.     The Committee have, therefore, decided torecommend to the Cabinet the third of the alternativesenumerated above.    Thoy consider that the first olemontin the new Home ?ule Bill should be the setting up ona definite date of two Parliaments, ono for tho province of Ulster, and one for the three Southern provinces,and the complete withdrawal of British rulo from allIreland in all matters not specially reserved as herain-after shorn as from that date.10.     The Committee were influenced in coming to thisdecision by three principal considerations.     In thefirst place, their proposal gets rid of the tap root ofthe Irish difficulty by providing for the complete with-drawal of British rule from the whole of Ireland in the sphere of its domestic government.     It tima meets thefundamental demand of the overwhelming majority of Irish-men over since tho days of 0&apos;Connoll.    Secondly, it is entirely consistent both with the fact that there is amajority in Ulster as opposed to Dublin rule as thenationalist majority in Ireland is opposed to British rulothe fact which has wrecked the throe preceding Home HuleAots.
Acts,     It is further entirely consistent withthe Government pledges to Ulster.     The Committee&apos;8proposal that Ulater should he called upon to governitself cannot in any sense he called coorcion and aswill be seen Ulster will retain full representation in the Imperial Parliament according to population and therefore its citizenship in tho Unitod Kingdom.The proposal will certainly   herpljr affect Ulster.But if the withdrawal of British rule ana the ostab-lishmont of local legislature in Ulster is nocessaryin order to heal the feud which has estranged Irelandand Great Britain for sc many decades, and which isnow seriously imperilling the relations of great britain both with the rest of the Empire arid with the United States of America, the sacrifice which Ulster7/ill be called upon tc mate in assuming control of itsown looal affairs is one which the Imperial Governmentand Parliament is/entiiled to ask its people to make.\j j.. C d 2. jl111   Thirdly tho Committee&apos;s proposal will enormouslyminimise the partition issue.     The division of Irelandbecomes a   far less serious matter if Home is estab-lisbefl for both parts of Ireland than if tho oxcludod partis retained as part of Great Britain.     No nationalistswould then be retained undor British rulo.   All Irishmenwould bo self-governing.   If, owing to the opposition of Ulster it is necessary on principles of self-dotermina-tion to divide Ireland into two provinces, reasons of administrative convenience ought to be a principal con-aideration in drawing the line between them, as it was inthe federal constitutions of the United States and theDominions.     The Committee are advised that from thoadministrative point of view, the retention of the his-toric boundaries between Ulster and.the three other provinces would bo far the most convenient.   They therefore recommend it.     This arrangement has the further advantage that i&apos;t minimises the division of Ireland on purelyreligious lines.    The two religions would be not unevenlybalanced in the Parliament cf liorthern Ireland.IS.   But while recommending the setting up of two Parliamentsin Ireland the Committee attach the greatest importanceto doing everything possible to promote Irish unity.   Thisis not only desiruole in itself but is essential if thescheme is to rcceivo the support of moderate nationalists.To this end they mako two further proposals.   In the firstplace, they propose that for one year, but for one yearonly, certain services which it is specially undesirable to divide, notably agriculture, technical education,transportation, old age pensions, health and unemploy-ment, insurance and labour exchanges, should be reserved to the Imperial Parliament, and that a Council cf ireland should be established consisting of twenty representa-tives from each Parliament which the Lord Lieutenant or theBritish Minister in charge of these temporarily re-served services should consult about the policy in regardto them.     The Council of Ireland would further have powerscf
cf dealing with Private Bill legislation.13.        In the 3eoond place, however, and this Is far moreimportant, the committee propose that the two. Irish Parlia-ments should he given far-reaching constituent powers.   they propose that the two  rish Parliaments; by passing identicallegislation,  3hoUld have the power under the Bill, withoutfurther reference to the Imperial parliament j-(a) to transfer at any time even Within the first year, any of the temporarily reserved services, or anyof their own powers, to the control of the Council ofIreland.(b) to revise the constitution of the Council ofIreland itself in any way they think fit, bo that itmay, if both parliaments agree-, become a parliamentelected by electors for&apos; the whole of&apos; Ireland., either on a unitary or a federal basis, controlling all or anyOf the temporarily reserved services, and ail or any ofthe pOY^ers originally allotted to the North andSouth Ireland Parliaments.(c) to ask the Imperial parliament to retain controlof the temporarily reserved services beyond the first year, if they want further time to deliberate about their common affairs.   Failing such a request, however,these services would automatically be divided betweenthe two parliaments.14.        The Committee feel that starting from the assumptionthat regard must be had to the principle of self-determination,they have thus done everything which an onteide authorityoan do to bring about Irish unity, without in any way infringingthe freedom of Ulster to decide its own relation to the restOf Ireland.   The reservation of certain administrative services for a year is a powerful practical recognition of the objcc-tions to partition,T-he automatic transfer at the end of theyear is not only a proof that Irish self-government is to hegenuine, but a strong incentive to immediate action towardsIrish unity,       The constitution of the Council of Irelandbrings together elected representatives of the whole; cf ireland in a single chamber for the discussion of common Irish affairs,who are thus compelled to meet and do business together, with no suspicion of coercion on either.   At the same time eitherthrough thr agency of the council of Ireland or by other means,the two parliaments, which will not be mere political conven-modifications, but the bodies actually responsible for Irish Govern-ment and therefore far more sober and practical, will have complete power by agreement to bring about Irish unity on any basis ranging from federation to what is practicably dominion status.16.        Finally there is the Imperial aspect of the problem.The committee would propose to reserve to the imperial parliament complete control over the following matters(l)   The Crown(2)   peace and War. i(3)    \rmy, Navy and Air Force,(4) Treaties and foreign relations.
1   343(j?) Dignities and honours.(6) Treason, naturalisation etc.(7) Trade with any place outside the jurisdiction of the Iriih Parliament a,, quarantine,&quot;navigation etc.(8) Wireless. ,(9) Postal services outside Ireland.(lO) Coinage, trademarks etc.The aforementioned powers are substantially tho sameas these reserved under the 1914- Act.   They provide completelyboth for the unity of the Umpire, and fox the dtrategicsecurity of the British Isles.17. The Imperial Parliament would also at the outsetreserve the following powers which would not go over toIreland automatically at the end of a year.(a) Customs and Excise.(b) Income Tax and Excess Profits Duty.(c) Internal poetsl oeattaioatiwp.The question of what is to happen to tiiese powers must,-depend upon what the two Irish Parliaments agree upon as thefuture constitution of Ireland.    In the opinion of theCommittee, however, if ITorth and South Ireland agree t*constitute a single legislature for Ireland and to ask thatthese powers should bo transferred to it, they should havethe power to take them over, thereby setting Ireland up onthe same basis as a Dominion oxcept in the sphere of defence^Unless and until the two Parliaments agree to set up suoha legislature and to confer upon it these powers, theyshould remain vested in the Imperial Parliament.    As to thedetails of this part of their scheme the Committee re-servejudgment pending a consideration of the financial aspect o their proposals.18. In regard to representation in the imperial parliament the Committee are clear that so long as the.Imperial Parliament exercises taxing powers in Ireland,Ireland must have the right to representation in the imperial parliament on the basis of population.    This, however, shouldoe coupled with a provision that Irish jaembers shall not baAllowed to speak or vote on anjr queetioa which in theOpinion of the Speaker, if it related to Ireland, would lie^ithin the scope of the Irish legislature.    As to whatontribution Ireland should make to the Imperial Services ift elected for Dominion status, and as to how Ireland shouldhen be represented in the Imperial Parliament, theCommittee has reached no conclusions.    These questions &apos;willbe further examined in connection wi,thi.he finances of the3111.
2, Whitehall Gardens   S.W.1.November 4th 1919.*mTJ mm19,   To sum:t3p, what the Committee propose is to, follow the Peace Conference by respecting the principleboth of responsible government and of self-determination and to givo to the two parts of Ireland immediatelystate right3 together with a link between them, and togive&quot;them also the power to achieve Irish unity on any basis ranging from federal unity for the United Kingdom toa qualified Dominion status which they can agree uponamong themselves.     The Committee consider that thisis a fair and generous proposal, and one that offersa fair road to Irish Home Rule, to.Irish unity, and toa reconciliation between Ireland and Great Britain.It has the advantage :that it follows all american and Imperial precedents.     In every case a beginningwas made with self-government for the several pro-vinces or states, and this was followed by voluntary agreement to unite.    Further Ulster, while compelledto govern Itself, will suffer no coercion and will re-tain, until it otherwise consents, its representationand citizenship in the United Kingdom Parliament, and,if it oan persuade nationalist Ireland to its views, itwill be able to secure that Ireland forms part of a united Kingdom federation at the price of agreeing toIrish unity themselves. . On the other hand NationalistIreland will receive immediately state rights, and will further be able to establish Ireland practically on a dominion basis if she can persaude Ulster to accept union on these terms, finally by withdrawing British rule once and for all from Ireland in all Ireland&apos;s local affairs,it takes away the reproach of coercion which is the prin-cipal Ingredient in Irish hostility to Great Britain, andin American and Dominion suspicion of British policy.20.   There is only one other point the Committee wishto mention at this stage.     They consider that theRoyal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin MetropolitanPolice should be retained as an Imperial service for aperiod of at least three, and some meabtsrs think six,years, or until a united Parliament has been establishedby consent for all Ireland.     This Is essential both inorder to safeguard the rights of individual members ofthese forces and to provide an effective safeguard for personal safety during the transitional period.   At thesame time it is no less essential that the local Irishministries should have the real responsibility for themaintenance of law and order.   ; The Irish Ministers,therefore, corresponding to the Home Secretary shouldhave the necessary power to order the movements of thepolice in the Interests of public security.     The quota system upon which the organisation of the Constabulary isbased would appear to make some such arrangement possible.
