Progress to date.&apos;The present position of the National Housing Schemeis far from satisfactory.   The rate of pr-ogress is disappoint-ingly slow and difficulties and obstructions have been encountered at every step.    Many of these difficulties havealready been surmounted either by reason of the operation ofthe new Housing Act or by administrative action.     nevertheless there remain causes of serious delay which, in my judgment,can only be removed by drastic action on the lines recommendedherein.A sketch of the existing machinery and of theposition at that date was contained in my previous Memorandumof 15th August (G.T.8015) and I do not propose to repeat theinformation contained in that Memorandum.   A summary statementof the present position is appended to this Memorandum (Appendi:When I wrote my previous Memorandum the organisationboth central and local had been completed, the Housing Acthad been passed, and the first stage, namely:- the acquisitionof sites, had been advanced further than might reasonably have been expected&apos;.     At that date the site plans alreadysubmitted for approval were sufficient for over 380,000 houses.At the present date fcltai site applications are sufficient for450,000 houses, so that we may safely claim to have masteredour first great difficulty of securing and approving sites.The serious feature of the present position is that plans have only been submitted for 41,023 houses and there istherefore a clear heed for some effective action which willaccelerate the submission of house plans and the actualcommencement of building on the sites already acquired. ,11&apos;     Difficulties,The chief difficulties with which we are at presentconfronted arise out ofi-(1) the cumbersome procedure and dilatory methodsof the local authorities;
(2) the disinclination of the builders to take their share in the National Housing Scheme; and(3) the high prices, the supply of labour, and the deficiency of transport,These various points of difficulty tend in some degree tointeract upon and aggravate&apos; one another, and there can be nodouht that the difficulties of local authorities are increased and prices are raised owing to the conditions.now prevailing in the building trade     Apart from the question of rates of wageswhich is dealt with in a later part of this Memorandum there is evidence that cottage building is at the present time less -attractivethan other forms of workc    The Labour Gazette of October 1919 showsthat in the third quarter of this year building plans were passedby 84 Urban Authorities for  5,900,000 of building work, and of thisonly  870,000 related to dwelling-houses.111w Present Powers of Direct Action.(1) In cases of Default.   Every local authority is requiredby the recent Housing Act to prepare and submit a housing scheme before October 31st, and thereafter whenever theMinistry consider it necessary*   If the local authorityfail in this duty, the Ministry may either transfer theobligation to the County Council, or undertake thenecessary work themselves.(2) Supplementary Action.    The Ministry may also assist alocal authority by direct action in order to secureimmediate provision of accommodation pending the pre-paration of the local authority&apos;s scheme.   This supple-mentary action, however, can only be taken with theconsent of the local authority.   It has been used inLondon in connection with the conversion of houses intoflats, and after considerable delay the consent of 18Metropolitan Boroughs has been obtained.   But under ourpresent powers the results of such action can only bebrought into the scheme of the local authority, with their consent, and this involves difficulty and delay,
IViRemedies proposed.The time which has elapsed since the Act cane into force has been used to prepare a plan of campaign which can be putinto operation in important centres where direct action becomespossible, to carry on&quot;trials of new methods of construction, andto conclude the agreements witn the Building Trade referred tobelow.t1) Direct Action.The cases of complete default on the part of the largerlocal authorities will be exceptional.    The cases of delay areunfortunately numerous.     In so far as delay is due to thedifficulty in acquiring, by agreement, sites capable of immediatedevelopment, or houses suitable for conversion, the wide-spreaduseof compulsory purchase orders which I have set on foot is having an immediate effect.     At the same time I am setting up a specialorganisation for dealing immediately with one cases of defaultwhen the period of grace (October 51st) expires.    The method of direct action which 1 propose can be adapted not merely to casesof default but to any case in which the provision of houses is urgently needed.     If there appears to.be any likelihood of delayon the part of the local authorities, I propose that the Officeof T*orks should at once undertake a   definite part of the localauthority fs schemes,    i If, for example-, I find that the urgent rquirements of a local authority are for 2,000 houses and thatthe resources of the local authority and of the local builders areonly sufficient to provide 1,000 houses., I should either directlyenter into agreements with the building trade according   to thearrangements herein explained or ask the Office of &quot;works to makeimmediate arrangements for the provision of the other thousand.. .The enquiries which I have made satisfy me that some of the largeLondon firms are willing and able to undertake the building of thousands of houses all over the country and I need scarcely saythat wherever possible I contemplate that arrangements of thiskind should be entered into with firms who have devised speedyand/
and economical methods of construction.But to make direct action effective without destroying the basis of the financial arrangements between the Exchequerand the Jocal authorities I must be in a position to take suchaction to recover the cost from the local authority, and totransfer to the local authority the responsibility for managingthe houses when erected, even without the consent of the localauthority.     I have accordingly given instructions for a Bill tobe prepared for this purpose and a preliminary draft of theBill is appended hereto.     (Appendix II)-(2) New, Methods of Construction.I am encouraging by every means the adoption of newforms of construction wherever  these promise to be rapid and economical.     A special Committee has been at work for somemonths on this subject and I annex a list which is about to bepublished giving particulars of methods of construction, otherthan brick, which have already been approved.   (Appendix III)Steps are being tkaen to draw the attention of the localauthorities to these methods of construction and I am arrangingwith the firms to quote definite prices for the production   ofhouses in large numbers.     A number of firms are now gettingout definite prices and it is   expected that quotations will beobtained for erection in large numbers of good houses ofconcrete of concrete block at  550 to  650 per house.    Definitearrangements of this nature have been made with Messrs Boulton andand Paul, Ltd. Norwich (timber-framed houses), George E. Clare,Harrow (interlocking terra cotta hollow block system), Dorman,Long &amp; Co.. Ltd., Westminster (steel and concrete system) and major Waller, Dorsetshire, (reinforced concrete construction).
(ft) Direct Agreement with the Trade.In order to deal with delay and at the same time to securethe co-operation of the builders, certain new methods ofprodeoure will be necessary.     Those Methods can be operated insome cases by the local authorities either as a supplement to,or-a substitution for:, the normal procedure.     In other cases it will be necessary to act directly through the machines y ofthe Ministry of Health or through the Office of Works.(a) Section 12 (3) of the Housing Act 1919 provides that,-subject to the consent of the Ministry a local authority (or incases of default tile Ministry directly) nay contract for thepurchase by, or lease to them,- of houses suitable for the workingclasses whether&apos;built at the date of the contract or intended tobe built thereafter.    This Section is capable of operation bythe Ministry as well as by the local authority in cases in which.  the Ministry exercises the powers of tho local authority.After considerable negotiation a model form of agreement has-been prepared whereby tho local authority will undertake topurchase houses of an approved type, to be completed before a specified date,for a fixed sum which rust be approved by theMinistry of Health4(b) 1-.&apos;ith a   lew to persuading contractors to placo their resources at the command of the Government Housing Scheme theBuilding Resettlement Committee have recently suggested that itmight be possible &quot;by minimising, tho amount of useless work involved in tendering, by removing, from.Firms the necessity, of fighting for fair forms of contract, and by distributing thejobs in such a way that the very great, number of smaller firmswill be able to take up contracts of suito.ble size, to removemany of the causes which are. now set up deterring contractors fromtouching the Housing schemes*n   , I have now concluded an arrange-ment with the Resettlement Committee to give effect to thissuggest      /
suggestion, and more or less definite arrangements on theselines have been .made with builders&apos; federations in birmingham and Newcastle.Under these arrangements, a fair price per house willbe fixed in consultation between the members of the building trade and the Quantity Surveyors   of the local authority and ofthe Ministry, and the work then distributed among the builders.The Resettlement Committee assure me that this procedure will attract builders, and at the sane time I am persuaded that,by bringing in the Quantity Surveyors at&apos;the initial stage of thenegotiations and by allowing the builders to make practical,suggestions for reducing the cost of building, houses canbe erected under this procedure at no more, and I h$ype even at less, cost than those secured by means of competitive tenders,(4)   Bop.! to Private BuilderseThe proposal to subsidise private enterprise byway of a State grant to builders of  100 or thereabouts perhouse erected in accordance with approved plans has again been brought forward.    This proposal has been rejected asimpracticable by every Committee whicJh has reviewed thehousing problem) and their decision has, I understand,been endorsed by the Cabinet.    There can be no doubt, however,  .that a scheme on those lines would produce the houses.(5)   Control of Wages and Building Operations.I have very carefully considered the Memoranda bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (0.T.8354), the Minister ofLabour (G.T.8272), and the Chief Commissioners of Works (G.T.82-18), on thesubject/
)subject of rates of wages in the building trade, and I ha-fae proposalsprepared for preventing the diversion of the resources of the trade from the Government Housing Scheme to other works of less public fUtility and to checking an unreasonable increase in the idready high cost of providing houses for the working classes.     The powersnecessary to give effect to this proposal are contained in clause 2of the draft Bill new submitted..While) however, I think it is essential that measures should be taken for this purpose without undue delay, 1 am not infavour of a complete control of the building trade such as theMinister of Labour suggests, and I agree with the Chancellor of theExchequer that it is doubtful whether Parliament would consent to theestablishment of a new control of so extensive a character.I may remind the Cabinet that the control of the building trade established during the War was far from satisfactory, and that-even the limited amount of regulation proposed by the Building-Materials Supply Committee was rejected by the Minister in charge ofDemobilisation in December last,,    And- the Parliamentary HousingGroup with whom I discussed some aspects of this problem during the summer were decidedly opposed to the reimposition of any form ofcontrol such as obtained during&apos; the War.The system of licences which was adopted during theWar is not only irritating to the trade and to the public as experience has shown but it lends itself to evasion and it.involves a complex and costly organisation..    And any attempt to re-introduce such asystem would, I am sure, be regarded with great suspicion by thetrade unions *,&quot;&apos;It is sufficient,.! think, that powers should be takento. prohibit or restrict any buildings or class of buildings in any area which are.of less public utility than dwelling houses.     Theadministration of a simple measure of this kind would, require, no special organisation, but it would be effect.;.ts. in preventing theiiimmmillll lllllHIBTM

APPROVED CONSTRUCTIONMETHODS.The following&apos; methods of construction have beenapproved by the Standardisation and ConstructionCommittee of the Ministry of Health.The names given are those of persons or firms whohave brought these new methods before the Coni-mittee. h&apos;or any further information inquiriesshould be made, direct to the addresses as printed.Several of these firms are prepared to erect thesehouses in large numbers throughout the country and can quote prices.It should be noted that approval has been given insome cases on the understanding that certain modi-fications are made. Particulars of other methodsapproved will be published in subsequent issues of housing : Captain Adams, 58a, Warrington Crescent, MaidaVale, W.9.This is a System of Construction for the Utilisation of surplus War Materials :-The framework of the building is composed oif the dis-used under parts of motor ca,rs, lorries, tram rails, etc.The walls are built with concrete &quot;blocks, reinforced withbarbed wire secured to the stancheons. The wall has acavity, and is lined internally with Hy Rib metal lathingand plastered in the usual way.The floor girders are embedded in concrete, and finishedwith a composition floor.BelVs United Asbestos Co.&apos;s, Southwark Street,London, S.E.I.System of Concrete Construction, cased with AsbestosSheeting:  This is a method of construction where light steel frame-work is built up, to which asbestos sheets are secured on both faces and the cavity filled in with concrete, thoroughlyencasing the steel.Floors are constructed with T irons, between which ceil-ing slabs are fitted. Reinforcement rods are then fixed tothe T&apos;s, and the upper part filled in with concrete, forming a reinforced floor. The upper surface is finished to receivelinoleum.Experimental houses are built at Harefield, Middlesex.Bonlton &amp; Paul, Ltd., Norwich.Timber-framed houses for positions where proper precau-tions are observed in regard to risk from fire, and on condi-tion that match boarding is not used for internal linings,and that a permanent roof covering is used. Built onbrick or concrete foundation.British Craft Homes, Mr. II. Llewellyn Bent, Huxley,North Cray, Kent.This is a. system of reinforced concrete construction with pre-cast and site-moulded elements, being permanentlyconnected together by the operation of moulding the latter.These Wo elements are combined, so that one kind willinterlock with the reinforcement of the other, thus forming a structure of which the greater part lias been pre-cast.George E. Clare, 2, College Road, Harrow.Interlocking Terra Cotta. Hollow Block System of Con-struction :  The walls are formed of cavity blocks 6 ins. thick, withthe outer,skins of the blocks not less than 1 in. thick.The floors are constructed of similar blocks, reinforcedbetween the joists. A sample house is in course of erectionat Wembley Park.Dale, Cook &amp; Thornton, Ltd.. Cobden Road,Lcytonstonc, E.&quot; Dalcot&quot; System of Concrete Slab and Block Buikl-ing:  This is a system of prc-oast. tongued and grooved con-crete slabs, built as a cavity wall, using 2dn. thick blocksfor buildings of one storey, and 3 ins. thick for two storeys.The wall is strengthened with stancheons formed by inter-locking H blocks, encasing a reinforced concrete core. Thefloors and roofs are built of timber in the usual manner.Dorma-n, Long &amp; Co., Ltd., Clarence House,4, Central Buildings,-Westminster, S.W.I.Steel and Concrete Construction:  The houses on this system are built up with steel framingcovered externally with Hy Rib metal lathing, thoroughlycased in fine concrete, finished outside with stucco andrough oast.The steel framing of the walls is completely embedded inconcrete to protect the steel from rust.The walls are finished internally with breeze or plasterslabs.Floors are constructed with steel channels and Hy Ribmetal lathing, which serves as a centering, and finishedwith a concrete floor 3 ins. thick, the surface being finishedoff to receive linoleum. The beams are encased and the ceiling plastered on the underside.Houses on this system are in course of erection atDormanstown, Redear.-Mr, Frank Hewer,, 36, New Broad Street, E.C.Lean System of Hollow Concrete Interlocking BlockConstruction:  The blocks forming walls are about 12 ins. x 6 ins. x8 ins. The method of laying is by dipping them in slurry ontho bottom and one end and placing them in position onthe wall, instead of laying- them with trowel and mortar inthe usual way.Cottages have been built on this system on the DebenhamEstate, Dorchester.John Mitchell, 4, Babourne Boad, Worcester.System of Concrete Block Construction:  This is a simple method of making blocks on the sitewhere cottages are to be erected. The box makes fourblocks at a time, and is easily operated by a man and a boy.This system is especially adapted for rural districts wheretho aggregate is easily procurable and transport expensive.Cottages have been constructed by this method in various parts of Ireland.Modern Building Co., Central Chambers, NorthStreet Quadrant, Brighton.&quot;Doric&quot; System of Construction:  This system consists of a skeleton frame in timber to both faces of which asbestos sheets are fixed, with thecavity filled in with concrete, forming a wall 9 ins. thick.The outer face of the asbestos is treated with waterproofmaterial.The upper storey slightly oversets the lower to providebearing for floor joists.Experimental cottages are being erected at Brighton.6&apos;. A. Slater, A.M.I.C.E., F.S.I.. Borough Surveyor,Newport, Isle of Wight.Slater&apos;s 3-Ply Walling:-Tho wall is constructed with half-brick thickness on the outer face and a lining of 3-in. concrete slabs inside, witha  -in. cavity between the two walls, which is filled in withcement grout.This forms a vertical damp course through the wall andalso serves as a non-conductor of heat.Old bricks, after being cleaned on the face, can be used forthe outer part of the Avail. Mr. Slater has used this form ofconst ruction in works at Newport, and the method ofbuilding is fully described in the Surveyor for October 17.Major Waller, D.S.O.. Ham-worthy, Dorsetshire.The &quot; Waller&quot; System of Reinforced Concrete Con-struction:  The walk are constructed of reinforced concrete slabs8 ft. long by 3 ft. wide, and a,re formed of two thicknessesof those slabs, which are kept 4 ins. apart by wood centeringa short distance from the joints of the slabs.Vertical battens are fixed down the outer faces. In thebox space thus formed at the joints of the sheets reinforcc-ment is introduced, and a vertical concrete column ispoured. After this has set, the fillets on the face arcremoved and the joints faced .The floors are constructed of pre-cast reinforced con-crete joists and slabs similar to those used in the wallconstruction, with a poured concrete joint between them.An experimental pair of these cottages have been erectedat Poolc on Corporation land.
