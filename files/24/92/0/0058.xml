Therefore it is recommended that you should oonsider the advisability of including those cities, besidesKharkoff, Rostoff-on-Don, pkaterinodar and Hovorossisk, in yourprogramme.   The great drawback is insufficient &quot;transport, whichwill possibly become more serious as the advance presses north-wards,   whatever rolling stock may be oaptured from the Bolsheviks,it i-\ not expected that the facilities for transporting goods willthereby be improved, seeing that the area to be served will haveincreased in greater ratio.Great efforts arc now being made to arrange for the supplyof fresh locomotives and put repair sfcops into a condition per-mitting of the execution of light repairs to the great number oflocomotives and wagons seeding them.Novorosjiisk and Odessa will be important centres for yourAgency, while Rostoff-on-Don and possibly Kharkoff should haveBranches.   A small Branch might be established at Ekaterinodar,which is situated In the Kouban.   This province, you will be aware,has separatist tendencies, and action there is rather fettered.Still the province is an important one and a Branch might alsobe oonsicered there, but a lot cf course depends on the staff atyour disposal and the general arrangements you contemplate.All cities are overcrowded,, and particularly Kliarkoff andRostoff present difficulties from the point of view of acoommoda-tion, premises bein/ difficult to obtain.

report BY major pikder, CKTSfr (JP the british 1 nMrelie? mission tn south russia ON the COMMER- *cial situ/IT ion in south russia.R$STOFP-on-I)ON27th September 1919.Further to my various despatches regarding the deadlock hroughrUabout by the obstruction to trade set up by tho officials of theGovernment Departments of the Commander-in-Chief of the A*P0 in S.R.and by tho trafficking in export licences. I have continued tocast about for an explanation of the extraordinary situation that now exists.   It seems to me that it is in no small measure due to.the strong opposition set up by the strong groups of merchants- in-cluding Messrs9Riabushinskt, Krivoshoin (former Minister of /^ric&apos;.&apos;.!-ture) Rostobzeff, Asjeieff, Vtoroff and many other well known perronsof high commercial or financial standing, who view with grave concern the attempt by the Trade &amp; Industry Dept. to carry on business,With the advance of the Volunteer Army and the extension of the lib-erated zones, the opposition has increased, while in view of the factthat many of the officials impressed into the service of the Trade kIndustry Department are business men with their own interests, it isreadily oonceivable that they are against the oontracts handed outso generously, on terms ranging from 6$ to 2bfo commission, to variousBritish firms, of which Cosmos and its allied firms have several.In addition, the Trade and Industry Department have changed their mindsregarding those contracts, and moreover accuse the British firms ofnot having carried out the understanding whereby schedules were first to be submitted for approval before proceeding to make shipmentso   Asthe position, from both an economic and military point of view, has.undergone a great change since the contracts were concluded, andBoeing that raw materials for export are not readily available -although of course thfty exist in the country in private hands *I am of the opinion that it would b? wise, in the presence of theattitude of the merchants here to compromise or. the score of the oon-tracts and cultivate relations with the merchant groups.    Afterconversations with individual merchants I proposed to the Moscowformation - Protosoyous - to convene a general meeting to discuss their point of view, and I found unmistakeablo evidence that theywere really desirous of promoting relations with Great Britain andof avoiding connections with Germany and Poland who are often reach-ed through Italy, Roumania and Sweden.Unfortunately the British representatives out here who haveDe Lara contracts are reluctant to assemble in a body to discussthe situation and are each trying for the most part to virest on theirown some arrangement with the Trade and Industry Department.   This,I feel sure, is not likely to lead to any satisfactory result.   i therefore to-day despatched to you my telegram E 29 recommending thatfirms 3hould arrive at a workable arrangement through the merchantClasses here, rather than waste their time trying to compel theTrade k industry Department to do the for them impos sible and upholdthe letter of a contract whose spirit was hardly genuine on either side.    Regarding Mr.de Lara, London is probably arare of all thatI could say.   Suffice it to add that there has been a Lack of good faith all round.The request I put up to General Holman does not seem to havebeon productive of dtract results.   General Denikin had a conference with Lebedeff and others three days ago, and I am to see the latteron Tueulay next, 30th inst-,   It may be noted that General Denikinhas a weakness for all those who first rallied round Korniloff&apos;standard, and seeing thav.. no-onc has been found willing to&apos;takeLebedeff &apos;s post, General Dcn:&apos;.&apos;.::&apos;.n seems to have given him some advice and left him to carry on,   Le&amp;ucff is pleasant and amiable  butbothers himself too much with detailo   Also fee is unable to shewstrength in the face of his departmental chiefs and vis-a-vis
1   348the merchant class.   The point of view of the latter is one that must not be taeglectocLThere ore other considerations which should be weighed..All the British firms are acting ns middlemen In regard to goodsin which they are to some extent competitors,, and yet their commitsions vary very conriderably.   The whole errand undertaken byMr;de Lara,was bungledoF.W.S.PINDERMajor
