They appearto have gained their suooesseB by effective organisation and tohave profited by the apathy or the other Parties.   Many of thesuccessful Candidates are frankly revolutionary, and it is tobe expected that they may use their position to attempt tosmash the machine of Municipal Government, as a step towardsthe abolition of the capitalistic system.There is consternation at the announcement that unemploymentdoles may be discontinued this month.I      There is likely to be strong opposition to any measuretowards compulsory arbitration in Labour disputes.   The &quot;DailyHhrald&quot; is making great play with the suggestion that the rightto strike is in peril.&quot;While the shortage of houses is still an aotive oeuse of unrest, the high cost of living is, on the whole, the mostserious grievance.   It seems to be doubted whether the prosecution of retailers for petty aots of profiteering ishitting the right people, for it is believed to be thewholesalers and the big oombines who are keeping the priceshigh.Ohere is a good deal of disoontent among ex-soldiers onacoount of unemployment, and some branches of ex-Service men*organisations are joining the extremists.She campaign for nationalisation of the coal mines is proceeding and, exoept in Staffordshire, the miners appear tobe/SUMMARY
be united in their opinion: even in Staffordshire, whereminers are divided, it is believed that the men would respto a call for a strike,   $he restraining influence at themoment is the belief that the Government has made plans fogetting ooal enough to tide over the period of the strike,The Co-operative societies are reported to have beenbuying food in unusually large quantities.   (This is believto be a part of the sonerne for feeding the strikers and thfamilies during the next big struggle.She &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,is continuing its appeals for monestart an edition in Manchester and other p3aoes,   Always vin its financial statement^,,it how alleges tb&amp;t &quot;at least 125.000&quot; is already invested&apos;.

MONIOIP2&amp; BL30TIOK3The event of the week has been the return of a verylarge number of Labour candidates.   The votes polled1 throughout the country were probably not much more than25$ of the register, but Labour was organised and&apos; determined while the other parties were apathetio andindolent.   The Labour candidates have the great advantageof being able to canvass through the 3hop Stewards inthe works, and the same kind of pressure w.\3 brought tobear upon the workmen as in the case of strikes - thosewho abstained felt themselves in danger of being termed&quot;blacklegs&quot;.   It was really a very fine effort of partyorganisation,   No opportunity was miesed:   in Fulham,teachers at the London County Council School are reported to have urged the boys and girls to tell their parents to vote for Labour.   The other parties ooulddo nothing in the way of mass canvassing and littleeffort seems to have been made to 0onduct systematichouse to house visitation.As a means of educating Labour candidates inresponsibility, trie election of Labour majorities maybe a gooC thing:   the danger lies in the faot tht,t 00many of the elected men and women are aeoratly pledged to smash the whole machinery of capitalism.   Theirelection was greeted by the singing of the &quot;ited Flag&quot;,and Mr. Fred Shaw, who was returned for Huddersfield,stated that he was a &quot;Bolshevik without any apology&quot;.It is, therefore, to be expeoted that in some Boroughsthe Council will try to redeem their promise of a&quot;new earth&quot; by raising tho rates to such a figure thatthe rate-payers will oombine in refusing to pay, andthe/
*M   2   -The campaign for nationalisation is in full swing,IMr. Smillie is ill, but Mr. Frank Hodges is untiring.Having addressed large meetings in Lancashire, he isnow in South Wales and will go on to Glasgow.   his speeches on the subject are familiar.   His principaltheme is the 6/- inorease.   At Liverpool he deolaredthat the Government could not publish an authenticWhite Paper &quot;beoause their political juggling andtriokery would be so exposed.&quot;No special meetings have been held during the weeklin Northumberland and Durham, but an official of theDurham Miners&apos; Association stated this week that by the&apos;end of the year they hoped to force the Governmenteither to adopt the Sankey report or go to the oountry.In Glasgow the miners&apos; Executive is making plans for declaring a strike on February 13th, 1920, toenforoe nationalisation.   In the Motherwell distriotthe miners support nationalisation because they thinkthat it will entail generous pensions at a comparativelyearly age,   The ballot on the Clyde resulted in amajority for the scheme, but it ia stated that the men would hesitate to strike, because they think that theGovernment is fully prepared to meet the emergenoy, andthat, with the help of the rtoyal Sngineers and Navallistings/,the capitalist system will be denounced as the realcause of the breakdown.   If these manoeuvres areresorted to in many Boroughs there may be a strongreaction against Labour at the next General Election.NATIONALISATION 0? THE COAL MINES
1   381Ratings, enough coal would be produced to keep thingsgoing.   Public feeling on the Clyde seems to be againstnationalisation.My correspondent in South Wales reports a ratherolever strategical move on the part of the Executive.With a view of obtaining eoolesiastioal sanction it has declared itself to be against the holding of meetings on Sunday... This Sabbatarianism has won the hearts ofthe Baptist Ministers who have great influence on the, saner miners, and as a consequence, in more than oneoase, the Chapels have been lent for nationalisationmeetings.   South Wales is not the only area In which theClergy have been mobilised.   In Yorkshire, the ftev. W.Grenyer, of days ton, has found biblioal support fornationalisati on.In North Staffordshire the opinion of the men is divided.   They would be in favour of nationalisation ifit would mean the abolition of the system of contracting,under which a contractor undertakes with the company to get coal at a fixed price and aots as a middle-manbetween the Company and the miners, making, it is alleged,considerable profits.   It is believed that though themen are not much interested in nationalisation they willobey an order, to strike if it came from their Executive.The publication of the eooounts of the doncaster coal-properties has been seized upon by the Yorkshire Miners1Association.   From these accounts it deduces that thepresent cost of obtaining coal, including percentagesand recent awards, is only 5s. 2d. a ton.One of my correspondents has found that the mosteffeotive/
effeotive propaganda against nationalisation is to telj;&apos;&apos; the men that when they become civil servants they willnot be able to take days off at&apos; their own sweet will,/is many of them only&apos;work&apos; three days a week, they receive   this&apos; suggcstien&apos;witir dismay.&apos;mr. John MoLean fs Contribution to the movement iajonly interesting in one respect. He is opposed tonationalisation, but he Is ready to back Mr. Smillie ijso far&apos;that it Is a move&apos;in the Class War. &quot;I am convinced&quot;, he sajss&apos;, &quot;that StaiHie will not desert hisolass and that if we deoirie on Communism, Smillie willbe with us.&quot;11 On the whole, it seems oertain that on thequestion of nationalisation&quot;the miners are^likely to be]&apos;.&apos; solid,THE CO-QgEitklTIVE SOCIETIES. AND Tjjj flfiXT 3MKBIn my last report an indication was given of theextent to which the Co-operative Societies were to beused during&apos;the next great strike. Trade Union money)being paid-into the Co-operative Sooieties as bankers,and reports are now being reoeived that the Jocietiesbuying very large quantities of food&apos; - canned pro visit and groceries. Their proceedings in this respeot may Iwell be watcher? by &quot;the Ministry, of Food, for if theyout the plan of supplying strikers on oredit, while&apos; rest of the community is made to go short, it will be necessary to oemmsndeer these supplieslMh distributethem equally throughout the community/ inoluding the strikers and their families.PHOPITEBBINO/
PROFITEERINGOf all the causes of unrest, there oon be no doubt, v- , that profiteering is at this-&quot;moment the greatest.   It isnot so much profiteering by tho retailer as themanipulation of prioes by the large Combines.   As far asLondon is oonoerned, the workers believe that there is a,solid ring at Billingsgate, Smithfield and Covent Garden,and it has been suggested that these might be broken if local markets were established, especially for vegetables,in the different Boroughs,   I am promised furtherinformation on the methods under which prioes are maintained.   But it is not only in foodstuffs that thereis cause for oomplaint,   The workerB believe, rightlyor wrongly, that the same vioious practice is at workin the clothing and boot industries, end that aGovernment that does not take drastic action has notthe interest of the working class at heart.There is a growing volume of protest against theprice of milk, and in some plaoea a, sort of passivestrike has ooourred and the prioe has been reduced inconsequenoe, Ohere is also an outcry against the increasein the prioe of sugar end a demand that oonfeotionera1supplies should be restricted. There is a growingfeeling that the Profiteering Tribunals do not hit theright people; they deal with trivial aots of retailersand leave the wholesalers and trusts untouohed,There is general consternation at the announcement that the Unemployment Donation will oease in November.&apos;In/
(English)In Liverpool they say that &quot;the Government would nodare to drop it during the winter months at any ratThere is a good deal of unemployment quite apart frthat which results from the Iron Moulders1 Strike,it is curious to find that the old prejudioe againstlabour-saving maohinery is being revived.   At a reoemeeting of the Garment Workers&apos; Union it was announothat, owing to the introduction of maohinery, fiftycutters had been discharged in Leeds, and that thiswas having a disastrous effeot upon the morality ofwomen and girls.   In the Oldham district the feeling is said to have beoome bitter.   The women are demand!work instead of charity and there is a movement towards emigration to Canada.   In Burnley 500 loomsare idle owing to laok of housing aooommodation forthe workers, while on the other hand there is aoomplaint in Bolton, Blackburn and Burnley of ashortage of weavers because the men prefer anoutdoor life to their former sedentary occupations.Considering the question of unemployment donation, it is to be remembered that Labour iagenerally disposed .to regard the doles as subsidiaryfinance for strikes.   This was the case in thereoent hallway Strike, and, aa I reported last week,the dookera were oounting on the unemployment donation for the auooesa of their projected&quot;experimental&quot; strike.   There will.undoubtedly bea loud outory when the doles oease, but on the.........whole it is likely to have a steadying effeot upon those who are engineering atrikea.1.;.;,:,&apos;.,.&apos;        .i,U.-i&apos;.THE HOUSING- QJESTIONMy correspondent in South Wales reports thathousing/
housing conditions in his riistriot are &quot;appalling.&quot;   OnNovember 3rd the Cardiff City Council passed the followingresolution;&quot;The Council, having heard the report of the&quot;Housing Committee regarding the indifferenoe and&quot;apathy of the Ministry of Health in giving&quot;facilities for the   iiraaediate building of&quot;sufficient houses at Cardiff, hereby enters a&quot;strong protest against the delay and demands&quot;to know the reasons for holding up the&quot;negotiations.&quot;There is a similar oomplaint of the Government methodsin Glasgow.Indirectly, the shortage of houses tends to inoreaseunemployment.  .&apos; THE POLICE STril&amp;BxffThe Polioe strikers are degenerating into hooligans.During a reoent prooession to Hyde Park they passed areligious and entirely inoffensive meeting and broke it up without any provocation.   Ihe leaders try to exeroisea moderating influence in the hope of strengtheningtheir position with the Trade Unions.   They believe thatthey will seoure reinstatement if a Labour Government. oomea into power.  .The two Polioe strikers who oontested Birminghamwards in the Municipal Elections were returned, as wellas the wife of a striker in London.THE PEELING AMONG DISCHAdflED SOLDIERSThere is muoh discontent among ex-Servioe men,especially in Leeds.   The principal grievances arelaok of employment and housing accommodation, theemployment of women, the shortcomings of the warPensions Committee and the disposal of the CanteenBoard fund,   Ike Leeds Branch of the National Federationhas/
THE INTSMATIONAIi UNION OF this  organisation must not be confused with theNational Union. It was founded in Glasgow in ^ay.1919by members of the Federation of Discharged andDemobilized Sailors and iJoldiers, who had oeoeded froJthat Society.   Its offioes are at 569, Argyle Street,Glasgow/has gone over in a body to the National Union for aourious reanon.   It appears that the former officials!of the Federation enoouraged the members to opposefie looal Socialists,   All went well till the nailwajjlStrike, when it transpired that many of the members were n&amp;ilway strikers.   Thereupon the leaders weredeposed and the body transferred itself to the NationalUnion, which is oloaely allied with the &quot;Daily Herald,BThere is a suspicion in the.district that the Governsis supporting the &quot;Comrades of the Great War&quot; andintends to instal ex-offioers as officials.   In SoutJilWales the discharged men are talking of affiliationwith the Lrhour Party, but on the other hand the refusal of the Amalgamated Jooiety of Engineers toaocept the Government sohame-for training disabled soldiers is likely to intensify the feeling ofresentment between ex-3ervioe men and Trade Unionists,The National Union is taking a referendum of its members as to the admission of ex-3ervioe women intothe Union,The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; announces the publication, onNovember 13th of a book for ex-Service men, entitled&quot;What is due to me,&quot; which it cesoribes as being&quot;paoked with useful and up-to-date information.&quot;   koopy of the book will be procured, and no doubt itthenwill/be found that it is intended to foment unrest byolaiming Ibaok-pay&apos; on the Colonial basis.
**    Q   Ma(English)Glasgow.    It Is frankly a revolutionary organisation, forthe overthrow of Militarism and Capitalism loom larger thanthe protection of the interests of discharged men.    ttiemembership is reported to be over 7,000, with four branohesin Glasgow and one in Blantyre, Dundee, Paisley, Kirkoaldy,Leven, Loohee, Bowhill, Dunfermline, Broxbum and Kllbimie.Other branches are in prooess of formation.    Happily, the finances are not prosperous.    It was intended to affiliatewith similar Associations in Canada, Australia, Russia,Germany and Italy, and with the Sinn Fein movement.    So farthere has been no response from abroad, probably owing tothe faot that the Union coupled its expression of brotherlylove with a request for money, and a response to the formermight have been looked,upon as a olaim to the latter, butthe Sinn Fein movement had no such hesitation.    CaptainJohn White, the son of General Sir George white, who hasalready given proofs of mental instability, has addressed a meeting of the Union and his suggested the formation of aVolunteer Corps which would eleot its own Officers with aview to helping in the &quot;Irish fi$it for Freedom&quot;.    Thesuggestion has, however, not been very well reoeived by the rank and file, and some of the speakers express doubts as towhether the Jinn Fein movement could strictly be calledinternational.The Union is affiliated to the Clyde Workers1 DefenoeCommittee, but its only branoh in England appears to be thenow moribund Sailors1, Soldiers1 and Airmen&apos;s Union.    Itsorgan, &quot;The New World&quot;, was published on the 31st May, butoeased after the issue of June 28th owing to laok of funds.
(English)It has now been re-started as the organ of the NationalUnion, and the International Union has to fall back upon-a column in &quot;The Worker&quot;, the organ of the Clyde WorkersCommittee.    It is not surprising to learn that theactivities of the International Union are hampered by the personal jealousy whioh prevails among its offiolals.Despite the fact that Beveral members of this Sooietjhave been deported to this country froaAmerioa, itsaffairs do not appear to be prospering if ono may judgefrom a notioe issued by Kfo. 9 looal, which was a follows:&quot;Your non-attendanoe will render you liable to&quot;attend a Committee Meeting and to give a&quot;satisfactory explanation,ttIt is always satisfactory when-one finds revolutione^organisations appealing for funds.    It is a sort ofante mprtem obituary notioe. ,lABOUiv COLLEGES.There is talk of amalgamating the Central LabourCollege, whioh belongs to the ^outh Wales Miners&apos;Federation and the National Union of iteilwaymen, and xfcisCollege..   The Central Labour College is frankly-     revolutionary and is resorted to by students who find thteaching of the labour College too moderate.The Sheffield Labour College, whioh is under thepatronage of the Looal Trades Counoil, the UooialistCommittee and the National Union of jiailwaymen, has iasuga synopsis of the weekly olasses for the Winter SessionThey oover ifte following subjeots;Industrial History,Industrial and Sooial History,Eoonomio Soienoe,The Fundaments of Sooial Joienoe,Annals of Toil,The Communist Idea through the Ages,Eoonomio Lectures, endEoonomio History.Jimong the lecturers is the well known extremist, Dr. F.\Chan

One oanimagine the kind of eoonomios and history, that is taught bysuoh a person, and how it is likely to work in the minds, of uneducated youths.    In Glasgow the Labour Colleges andSocialist Classes are said ,to be very successful.    They arfunder the apodal, care of Mr. John McLean, who has notbeen niggardly in giving us specimens, of nhat he teaches.The North London Branch of &quot;the Herald League has justarranged a twenty-week course on, Industrial History, atwelve-week course on Public.Speaking, and a sixteen-week, course on the principles of Eccnomios.3o far, there is no healthy teaching to counteractthis kind of teaching exoept the lectures organised by thexieconstruotion Society end one or two other organisations.When ;so much money and energy is spent on propaganda, itseems a pity that the organisation of sound economicteaching in the big industrial centres has not been seriously taken in; hand,.  :&quot;toe JEiwg&apos; wao!3 who&quot; &quot;An anti-Semitic publication is to be issued shortlyby a body oalling itself the Judaic Publishing Company.It is to bear the secondary fyLtle of &quot;Israelite Finance -Its Sinister Influenoe.&quot;   Its quality may be judged bythe names of the projectors, Mr. H.H. Beamish, Mr.f.l. Powler and Dr. J. H. Clarke.   All of these belong to the ooterie controlled     Mr. feraberton Billing.   if one may judge from the prospectus there will be amplematerial for a crop of libel actions.   The same Companyhas issued a prospectus of a proposed journal entitled&quot;Jewry fiber Alles.MLIEUTENANT/
j *- 12 *-(English)LIEUTENANT COLONEL MALONE. M.F.Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Lestrange Malone, M.P.for Leyton, returned to the United Kingdom on the 28thOotober, after visiting Mosoow and Petrograd,   He wentimmediately to the of floe of the &quot;Daily Express,&quot; whiohhas oontinued to publish his articles, though it isunderstood that some of them were refused as being tooopenly Bolshevik propaganda.    Ohe following note ofColonel Malone1s earlier activities may be of interest:He held-, and still holds, a Commission in the Navy,and he was known among his b.other officers as a person of extreme views.   In April last a meeting of theSailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;8 Union was held at lea.,Heddon Street, attended by Commander Kenworthy, Mr. NeilMaclean, M.P., and Colonel Malone.   Shis was the prefaoeto a meeting at the Abbortsford Hotel, ^iussell Square,where Colonel Malone met Mr. Robert Williams, of theTransport Workers&apos; Federation and Mr. W.F. Watson,now undergoing a term of imprisonment for a revolutionaryspeech.   Plans were discussed for seizing Whitehall andWestminster and for feeding the troops who were expectedto join the revolutionaries.   It is to be rememberedthat both Colonel Malone and Commander Kenworthy wereCommissioned Officers at the time.Colonel Malone appears to have got into russian the following way:-He had asked in the House of Commons whether aCommission oould not be s*nt to jftiBSia, and was told that it was not considered necessary.   He then applied for a passport for himsel/, Which was refused.   Onthis, he appears to have obtained a passport on thepretence that he was attached to the Military mission in Finland.   He arrived at Helsingfors on September20th, and prooeeded to Viborg, where arrangements were/
(English)were made for his journey by Sulo Vulijoki, a FinnishSenator of Communist sympathies.   He then made his way, with the help of Bolshevik agents, to Lake Ladoga,whioh was orossed in a sailing vessel.   In Russia hewas the guost of the Communist Party, and he accompaniedTrotsky to a review of troops near Moscow in the same-motor-oar, the Bolsheviks naturally regarding him as afirsWate medium for propaganda.IRELAND   (With the exoeption of the attacks * on Polioe barracksin Meath, whioh resulted in the murder of one oonstableand the wounding of a sergeant/there has not been anyoonspiouous aot of lawlessness, but the County of ClareIs in a most unsatisfactory state.The Sinn Fein movement showed no new developmentduring the week and is making no apparent progress,In the absenoe of its recognised weekly papers, whichhave not yet resumed publication, there is nothing toshow that any new policy is to be inaugurated, or whatthe present opinions of the leaders are.An informant who has hitherto proved most reliablestates that a split has taken place in the ExecutiveCounoil of Sinn Fein and is likely to .*embarrass if not destroy the movement in the end.  Atthe secret meeting of the Convention in Dublin on the eve of the suppression of Sinn Fein, John McNeill andJames 0!Meara depreoated the murders and outragesthroughout the country, whioh the public, they deolared,attributed to Sinn Fein.   3ome of those present, including... number of priests, condemned MoNeill and 0!Meara formentioning suoh matters at all, and the proceedingsbeoame very stormy for a time.   It appears that since this/
(English)this soene each Sinn Fein M.P. has been dirooted toreport whether the majority of his constituents approiof Sinn Fein as a Revolutionary or as a PolltioalMovement,A priest oonduoting a mission at Skehavanagh,Galway, East iftding, vigorously denounced Sinn Feinseoret society work. and offered to absolve from theiroaths any members present \foo would give up the work.A large number of Sinn Fein prisoners, releasedon hunger strike, returned to their homes in theprovinces during the week.No definite, tendenoy towards Bolshevism isobservable, nor have any revolutionary Labour speeohealbeen delivered.   No revolutionary literature has oomeunder notioe, but the paper &quot;Watchword of Labour.&quot; iaBolshevist in tone.B. H. T.
