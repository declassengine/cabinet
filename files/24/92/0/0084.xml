This document is the property oi His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.VAIR ROUTE FROM EGYPT TO INDIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.I invite the attention of my colleagues to the accompanying copies of a minuteand memorandum, with map, prepared by the Chief of the Air Staff upon themaintenance of an air route from Egypt to India.Cairo is the seat of our air power, but if we are cut off by the desert on theEast, the mobility of the Air Force and our power of re-enforcing our air squadrons in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, at any threatened point will be seriouslydiminished. Air power is the cheapest way of maintaining order in the East. Ifwe both lose our present air route through Syria and Mesopotamia, and cannot&quot;jump &quot; the desert, we shall be compelled either to maintain Air Establishments inEgypt, Mesopotamia and India on a larger scale to make them self-supporting, or to forego the advantages of air power and to entrust a larger share of the responsibilityfor maintaining order in these countries to other and more expensive arms.As the matter is urgent, I trust that it may come before the Cabinet at an earlydate.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.&apos; Hth November, 1919.Minute by the Chief of the Air Staff to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.I attach a Memorandum which has been prepared by the Air Staff on the routesfrom Egypt to India, together with a map.If a communication cannot be maintained between Egypt and Mesopotamia andIndia, it cuts right in half the main strategical air route, and precludes all possibility atpresent of quickly reinforcing India and Mesopotamia and Egypt and vice versa,This prevents full advantage being taken of the rapidity of movement which theAir Service should have and reduces it to a very slow moving force. It would, inaddition, necessitate the keeping of a greater number of squadrons in Egypt, India and/Mesopotamia than otherwise would be necessary.1 would, therefore, press that the War Office may give such instructions as arenecessary to Egypt, for them to investigate and thoroughly explore the question ofestablishing posts on the lines indicated in the Memorandum, so that the utility of theAir Service may not be limited in relation to the Far East. In this connection I would say that it may be possible to employ the Air Force in Egypt at present in exploringwith aeroplanes and Ford cars the possibility of establishing these posts and making such arrangements as may be necessary to maintain them. I cio not think that thedifficulty is insuperable if it is tackled now with energy.If you agree I will forward a copy of this letter and Memorandum to the Air Forceofficer in Egypt, together with any instructions you may think fit to send.H. Trenchard,22nd October, 1919. Chief of the Air staff memorandum on Air Routes from Egypt to India.1. The decision to evacuate British troops from Syria and to replace them byArab garrisons at Damascus, Horns, Hama and Aleppo, presents a difficult problemregarding the maintenance of air communication between, Cairo, Mesopotamia andIndia.2. The existing air route runs from Cairo to Damascus, thence to Abu Kemal on.the Euphrates, the stretch of Syrian desert to be crossed being thus reduced to a distance of some 280 miles.   If, however, we are denied the use Damascus and Abu(B19/503)   100   11/19  H&amp;S  7G50wo
Kemal as landing grounds, and are forced to maintain the route south of the southernlimit of the zone of Arab occupation, the stretch of desert to be crossed is increased toabout 400 miles. In order to surmount the obstacle thus formed by the Syrian desert,the following alternatives present themselves: (a.) To come to some arrangement with the Arabs whereby the use of the existingaerodromes and landing grounds can be continued, or(b.) To lay out a route further south, and take advantage of the line of oases thatexists.3. The possibility of (a) depends largely on the power of the Arabs to keep order and the maintenance of a friendly attitude towards us, and although the maintenanceof British personnel at the Damascus or other localities garrisoned solely by Arabs isobviousfy out of the question, it might be possible to maintain reserves of fuel, oil andspares under Arab care this would entail establishing the real point of departure forthe journey across the desert within the British zone in the neighbourhood of Haifa.With regard to (6), the line Bersa to Hit or Arama to Hit necessitates passing-over some 400 miles of desert, in which any emergency landing grounds selected wouldbe isolated and difficult keep supplied. Moreover, the attitude of the Bedouin is anuncertain quality.4. Another alternative is for the route to run from Cairo to Maan, thence to theEl Djauf oasis, thence to Hazil and thence to the Valley of Euphrates. This shortensthe journey to India by about 200 miles. In this case also important factors are atpresent largely a matter of conjecture. Although the maximum flight between oaseson this route would be 240 miles, the problem of supplying the oases with stores and fuel is at present difficult to appreciate without actual reconnaissance. Anotheruncertain factor is the attitude of the Arabs towards the establishment of air bases atthe oases named, and their attitude towards the crew of any machine forced to land.5. At the moment the most suitable solution appears to be to come to some agreement with the French on the one hand, and the Arabs on the other, which wouldenable us to maintain the route as it now exists, at any rate for the present, untilalternatives have been thoroughly investigated, and more learnt about the various factors in this problem.6. It is therefore of extreme importance that the political aspects of thesealternative routes should be immediately considered, as until a satisfactory solution hasbeen found the reinforcement of Mesopotamia or India is out of the question and mustnecessitate larger permanent Air Force Establishments in each theatre.21st October, 1919.
