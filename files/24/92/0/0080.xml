THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP. HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.iC &apos;    42-wntE p\ ______________________;x- IRISH RAILWAYS (CONFIRMATION OP AGREEMENT) BILL,ntJfejjgATOgM POR THE CABIHET BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.1*     When the Irish Railways were taken over an Agreement was made between the Government and the Railway Companies affected, underwhich the net receipts for the year 1913 were stereotyped as thebasis upon which the adjustment accounts as between the Governmentand the Railway Companies should be settled.2*     Difficulty has arisen with regard to tfto previsions of theAgreement, one of whioh (paragraph 10) deals with the positionof those Railways the Income of which is guaranteed by localauthorities under the powers of the Tramways and Public Companies(Ireland) Act, 1883 and the other (paragraph 12) which deals withRailways worked under agreement by Companies other than the owners.3.     Paragraph 10 of the Agreement provides that the stereotypedreceipts for 1913 shall be taken as the basis for calculating thepayments to be made under the guarantees and that until Statutoryeffect is given to that provision the Company concerned may include in their adjustment aocount as against the Government the sum forwhioh the guaranteeing authority would have been liable.4*     The guaranteeing local authorities have continued during thePeriod of Control to make payment accordingly, but one of suchlocal authorities nsw claims that their liability has become that cfthe Government because Statutory effect has not yet been given tothis term of the Agreement.     They have commenced an action for the recovery of the money they have paid under this guarantee.during theperiod of Control and legal opinion is that, in the absence of statutory confirmation of the Agreement, the action cannot be successfully defended.
5.     The Action will shortly come on for trial and it is therefore a matter of urgency that Statutory effect should be given to this termof the Agreement.6,*   &apos; &quot;The Bill also proposes to confirm paragraph 12 of the Agreement,the legal effect of which without Statutory confirmation is doubtful,particularly as, in some cases, similar guarantees are applicable toRailways which are worked by Companies other than the owners.7.     Should Statutory effect be not given to the terms of paragraphs;10 and 12 of the Agreement as proposed by the Bill) sums of money which are properly chargeable to local rates will fall to be paidby the Exchequer.8.     1 present a Draft Bill to achieve these objects and requestleave for its introduction at an early date.(Sgd.)
