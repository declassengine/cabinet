This document is the -oro-oort? 01 His Britannic Majesty&apos; a Government..q Tji m tj w rn q, n   ft   &apos;a  T )J T ip0,P, 5.Off VICIkJj HISTORY OF TIB WARMrtFortosouo&apos;3 Article in the &quot;Quarterly Heviow&quot;.(llote &quot;by the Secretary)In carrying out the Cabinet1s decision.that I was to inform mr.Portescue that his services would &quot;be dispensed with (WarCabinet 635, Minute l) I thought it advisable to consult theTreasury Solicitor as to the terms of the letter.     Sir JohnMellor, to whom I explained in full the torms of MrcFortescue1sappointment, advasGd that there was an element of risk in cutting off his salary immediately,    MrvFortescue is not a public servantbut a private individual paid to carry out the contract for theGovernment.    Moreover, as I am advised by        &quot;fcenerelEdmonds, the military expert of the Historical Section, he wascareful in writing his article to avoid the use of confidentialmaterial.    Mr.?ortescue has therefore committed no offence underthe Official Secrets Act.     The principal charge that can bolaid against him is, that by entering into public controversy, hehas compromised the impartiality of the Official History.After seeing the Treasury Solicitor I reported the matter to the Prime Minister, Mr.Bonar Law end Mr.Chamberlain, whoauthorised me to send the attached letter.     It will be seen,that Mr.Fortes&apos;cue. though retaining his salary until December 31st,ss already arranged, is asked to take no further pert in theHistory.     I should mention that the first volume of the History,which Mr.Fortescue had undertaken to complete, is already written.Certain corrections are required to ensure accuracy and these can be effected by the Staff of the Historical Section in communication with the General Staff.I also
I slso consulted the Treasury Solicitor as to the property in Mr.Fortescue&apos;s work,     Although he could not give enex catheara opinion without looking into the matter more closely, he was inclined, et first sight, to the view thatthere was ver,y little doubt that the property is vested inthe Government,     This is else the view of the HistoricalSection,(signed)   M.P.A.Han3ceySecretary, Cabinet,Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 8th October, 1919.
Copy of letter from the Secretary, Cabinet, toThe Hon.John Fortescue,C.V.0,, dated october 28th, 1919.Sir,I am directed by the Prime Minister to inform you thatthe attention of the Government has been celled to an article of a controversial nature by you in the October $umber of the&quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, entitled &quot;lord French1s &apos;1914&quot;\The Government consider it highly important that theOfficial History, when published, should be recognised ss thor-oughly impartial.    While expressing no opinion upon the merits of the controversy, they feel that the character of your articlemakes it impossible for you to continue your association withthe History without compromising its impartiality.You will recall that it was arranged in correspondenceinitiated.by you on the 16th August, and replied to by me onAugust 19th in a letter acknowledged by you on the same date,that your official connection with the History should terminateon December 31st.     I am now instructed to inform you that,while your salary will continue to be paid until that date, theGovernment do not, in the intervening period, propose to call upon you to do any more work in connection with the OfficialHistory.I em, etc( sgd) MaP.A.Hsnkey,Secretary of the Cabinet,The Hon.
