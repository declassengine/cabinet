Board) to deal with the question ofthe supplies of essential waw materials for the UnitedKingdom,    It was also considered that the Board would subsequently be of       great assistance in any arrangementsfor the post-war allocation of raw materials amongstthe Allies.The Board has dealt with the work for whichit was primarily appointed.    Other bodies, andparticularly tho Supreme Economic Council in Paris,have since been set up which are dealing with the wider aspects of the question;   and it is very desirable toavoid needless multiplication of overlapping boards and Committees.    I have accordingly consulted Mr. Longwho, as Secretary of State for the Colonies acted as chairman;   we are agreed that the time has now arrivedfor dissolving the Raw Materials Board,and are arrangingaccordingly.M.28.10.19. *
