S 33 C R II T tC. P.. 99.*LABOUR SITUATION.cabinet.CONTINUATION OF OUT-OF-v.rORK DONATION.Memorandum &quot;by the FirsCommissioncr of Works .Whth reference to the War Cabinet pap r C.P:. 65, Iwould like to draw attention to the report of the Ministryof Labour on page 393*The figures disclosed as to the number of p rsonain receipt of the out-of-work donation show hew justifiedhavft bJ*n tho statements as to th:- scandalous wast,  ofpublic money involved in pursuing this policy.    Wher^soon the one hand persistent complaints as to th--1 shortageof labour are received, on.* continually hears, on the other,of numberless instances of m^n and women rofusihg to workbecause th.jy can liv--- on the out-of-work donation.Xt is only by the c seation of this policy of doleswhich ie disastrous to the morale of the working classesthat the will to work and find employment will be re-established,Tht; unemployment figur-s of 4-75,000 for men and 92,000for women for th-  24th October last are difficult tounderstand without actual analysis.     On all aides onehears of the difficulty of obtaining labour; especiallyin the building trader, while-- th-&apos;&apos; - whole Government housing scheme is imperilled for want of workmen,,Industry is on the up grade and there, seems to beno reason to anticipate the growth of unemployment duringthe winter.   The unemployment figures given are not so faras I recoilegt abnormal compared with those prior to thewar.Ihile, however, the payment of out-of-work donationwao quite justified as an emergency policy to m^et thexceptional situation which arose on the cessation ofhostilities, I cannot ce^- how at the present time any suchjustification can be alleged for its continuance.(Signed).   aLFKESD MOKT.H,M.0fficejof works.11th ^Tovfriber^&apos;l9l9.
