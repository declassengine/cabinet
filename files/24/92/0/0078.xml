This Document is the Property of^Cd LONGHUIJpKlfitary Secret. 114611,0)JJ&amp;jjm Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,,^JJ &apos;        &apos;    Uli November 1919.riI&quot;Q(Repeated to Kashcjar and Vladivostock.)(Received 6th.)14994. 4th November. Malleson wires 2nd November, repeating Teheran and constantinople : &quot; There seems to be no doubt that important movements are taking place inTurkestan. Exactly what they are still remains indefinite, as evidence is (?) absurd.Everything points to (a) Bolshevik intentions to push through to Krasnovodsk assoon as possible; (b) to smash Bokhara apparently with Afghan aid. When these objects are attained, opinion in Turkestan seems to be very prevalent that invasion of Khorassan, again with aid of Afghans will take place.&quot; 2. As regards (a) Officer Commanding, Badjsan (? Bajgiran), wires 1st november that refugees from Askabad report Bolsheviks have issued orders for immediateconscription of everyone, irrespective of nationality, for advance on Krasnovodsk.&quot; Bolsheviks now said to have captured Kizil Arvat and to have proceeded on toUzun and Kasanjik. Large reinforcements have reached Bolsheviks from Tashkentdirection and their strength on Askabad frontds said to be 10,000.&quot; Bolsheviks are requisitioning all live stock and transport animals.&quot;3. As regards (b) it is difficult to obtain first-hand information, no intelligencehaving been received from my various correspondents on and beyond the Oxus forlast two or three weeks. Merv, however, is full of rumours of combined Bolshevikand Afghan operations against Bokhara.&quot; Camels from Merv are reported to have (corrupt group) Oxus with a view toinvasion of Bokhara. Amir is said to have torn up the railway on both sides ofBokhara. All Bolshevik and Afghan agitators are preaching the urgency of smashingBokhara as the chief obstacle in the way of Central Asian Mahomedan unity. last night leading members of Bokhara community in Meshed said that they had heard that Bolshevik reinforced by large force of Afghans from Mazar-i-Sharif side weremarching on Bokhara.&quot; 4. Afghan influence in Merv and to south is consolidating. The AfghanConsul in Merv is recognised as a more important man than the local BolshevikCommissioner.&quot; 5. Merv Agent, 25th October, says Bolshevik plenipotentiary with full powers(Suric) was expected there at any moment en route for Kabul, where he was to conclude offensive and defensive alliance between Bolsheviks, Afghans and Turks.Invasion of Persia was preliminary part of the programme, which had for its ultimateobject the freeing of Islam and the extinction of British power throughout Asia.&quot;
