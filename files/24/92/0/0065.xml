&apos;J MR,This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. - &apos; cTHE CABINET.TRANSFER TO THE AIR MINISTRY OF THE DEPARTMENTS, /      :    OF RESEARCH, INSPECTION AND SUPPLY.H   &apos; MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.I wish to call attention to the necessity of arriving at a final decision in this matterof the transfer of the Aircraft Production Department including the Directorates ofSupply, Research and Inspection from the Ministry of Munitions to the Air Ministry.This question was referred by me in January last to a Committee, consisting of-Sir James Stevenson, Bt., Chairman.Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B.Brigadier-General R. K. Bagnall-Wild.Major-General E. L. Ellington.Sir Arthur Robinson, K.C.B.Sir James Masterton Smith, K.C.B.Mr. G. Hutchins, Secretary.This Committee issued two reports, of which copies are attached.   It will be seenthat in their first report, dated the 22nd of January, 1919, they arrived unanimously atthe conclusion that the design and production of all non-standardized aircraft supplies should be transferred forthwith to the Air Ministry, the responsibility for standardisedaircraft supplies remaining with the Ministry of Supply and the staff of the Directoratesof Supply, Inspection and Research (late Technical Department) being allocated to thetwo ministries accordingly.   The Ministry of Munitions (acting for the Ministry ofSupply) and the Air Ministry have agreed upon a list of standardized and non-a / ,^^andardized aircraft supplies.tUvjl     The Cabinet&apos;in May approved of these proposals, subject to ratification by thew$ &apos; \ Prime Minister who telegraphed from Paris delaying the matter until his return.V-i     1        Since then airships have been handed over from the Admiralty to the Air Ministry,W3/     and the corresponding departments of supply, &amp;c, have already passed under thecomplete control of the Air Ministry, which is now in the anomalous position of beingwholly responsible for lighter-than-air craft while the Research, Inspection and supply departments for heavier-than-air craft remain under the Minisky of Munitions.U    \ Further, the Committee of Home Affairs recommended on the 9th October, 1919,\Hu*jUM* that the responsibility for Aeronautical Research should be shared between thei   Department of Scientific and Industrial Research  and  the Air Ministry; as the directorate of Research, being part of the Aircraft Production Department, is still under the Ministry of Munitions, the Air Ministry have no means of discharging this,responsibility.  .Still another reason why a decision is urgently required is because the 1920-21Estimates cannot be finally settled until the fate of the Aircraft Production Depart-ment is decided.The Aircraft Production Department is a self-contained organization, and thetransfer, when and if approved, c;m be carried out within a very few days.If a Ministry of Supply is not to be set up, the Aircraft Production department would inevitably come under the Air Ministry. If there is to be a Ministry of Supplyit should be remembered that the Stevenson Committee recommended, at a- time whenthe Cabinet had decided to form such a Ministry, that the responsibility for non-standardized aircraft supplies, and the staff in the Aircraft Production concerned withthem, should nevertheless be transferred to the Air Ministry, the responsibility forstandardized aircraft supplies remaining with the Ministry of Supply.An early decision on this question is very necessary for the reasons above statedand also because of the position of the staff affected, who have been for many monthscarrying on under a provisional reorganization in complete uncertainty as to their prospects. In fairness to them I would add that if, as I trust, the Cabinet approve theproposed transfer, they may be paid such rates of pay as the Treasury approve onreorganization, as from the beginning of the present financial year. - *WINSTON S.

FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE POSITION OFTHE AIRCRAFT TECHNICAL AND SUPPLY DEPARTMENTS.Members.Sir James Stevenson, Bt., Chairman.Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B.Brigadier-General R. K. Bagnall-Wild.Major-General E. L. Ellington.Sir Arthur Robinson, K.C.B..Sir James Masterman Smith, K.C.B.Mr. G. Hutohins, Secretary.To the Right Honourable Winston. S. Churchill, M.P , Secretary of State for Warand Air.Sir,1. The Committee appointed under your Minute, dated 18th January, 1919,addressed to the Secretary of the Air Ministry (copy of which is attached hereto,Appendix A), has considered the proposals you have put forward in. that Minute, andbegs to report as follows : 2, In the first place, the Committee desires to point.out that aeroplanes and aero-engines are a highly technical supply which is at the present time, and for many years will remain, in the experimental and development stage, and therefore subject to rapidchanges in design which can only be translated into production if the user, the designerand the producer are in the closest possible relationship. The Committee is convincedthat in practice j;his close relationship will not be forthcoming if use, design and production are delegated to different departments of the State.3. The Committee&apos;s investigations have shown that the success which has attended the work of the A aircraft Production Department of the Ministry of Munitions has beenthe practical recognition of this fact. Although in theory Design and Production arenow under a different Department to the User; in practice the Department is soorganized that the closest association exists between the Air Force as the User, theMinistry of Munitions as the Technical and Production Department, and the Manu-facturers as the Designers. Under the organization of the Aircraft production department the Technical Department is staffed by the Air Force, and forms theconnecting link by which the experience of the user is brought to the assistance of the design and development of aeroplanes and aero-engines. Further, the placing under one head of the Technical, Supply and Inspection Departments has obviated thedifficulties and friction which proved a check on the progress of aircraft development in the past. The Committee believes that any attempt at the present time to divorcedesign from production and inspection would not be wise.4. The proposition before the Committee, therefore, resolves itself into a considerationof two alternatives, viz., placing the three Departments under the Air Ministry, orplacing them under the Ministry, of Supply v Bearing in mind the fact with which theCommittee prefaced their report, viz., that the aeroplane and the aero-engines are stillin an experimental stage, it appears to the Committee that the reasons for adopting thefirst alternative are far more weighty at the present time than the advantages of having a common Supply Department for such highly technical articles. The future developmentof the aeroplane, both as a fighting machine and as a commercial, factor, is in thehands of the Air Ministry and anything which may tend to cripple or reduce the efficiency of that Ministry must be to the detriment of the development of aeronautical science,the importance of which is apparent to all at the present time.5. The Committee, therefore, considers that until the aeroplane and aero-engineemerges from the development stage and becomes a standard article, their design and production should be transferred to the Air Ministry.6. On the other hand it is important that the Fighting Force should be relieved&apos;as far as possible of the supply of stores and war material, and as it has been decided by the War Cabinet that a Ministry of Supply shall be set up for this purpose, theCommittee considers that all stores and aircraft supplies of a standard character
(whether technical or non-technical) should be obtained through the Ministry ofSupply, and that as from time to time aircraft supplies become standardized, so theresponsibility for supplying them should be transferred to the Ministry of Supply.7. The Committee has also considered the alternative proposition that the Ministryof Supply should become the Contract and Finance Department for the Air Ministry inrespect of aeroplanes and aero-engines. This proposal was found on examination to bedifficult to put into practice as the necessity for closely following up production fromthe earliest to the final stages in Aeronautical (Supply is closely allied to the technical and Inspection Departments and could not be delegated to the Contracts Branch. Itis, therefore, thought best for the present that the whole question of the production,the placing of contracts and the finance of non-standard aircraft supplies, should beundertaken by the Air Ministry.8. If these proposals are adopted the Ministry of Supply will provide the AirMinistry with a large quantity of stores and standardised material; and, further, willbe taking over other aircraft supplies as they become standardized. The Committee istherefore of opinion that the Ministry of Supply should have a representative on theAir Council.Recommendations:9. The Committee therefore recommends (i.) That the Ministry of Supply undertake for the Air Ministry the supply and production of all stores and of standardized aircraft supplies (whethertechnical or non technical),(ii.) That the Air Ministry undertake the supply and production of such aircrafttechnical supplies as are not yet standardized,(iii.) That such portions of the Technical, Inspection and Supply departments as are required by the Air Ministry be transferred to that body,(iv.) That the Ministry of Supply be represented on the Air Council.We have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)  J. Stevenson, Chairman.E. L. Ellington.W. A. Robinson.A. M. D.

APPENDIX A,MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS OF WAR.Secretary, Air, Whitehall Place,General Seely, S.W. 1.In principle the Air Ministry should control all plants and establishments of an experimental character necessary to enable them to form a dominant opinion on design.They should not manage factories or production in any respect. Having decided whatthey want thoy should order it from the Ministry of Supply, The Ministry of supply will be free to criticise design from the standpoint of convenience and economy ofmanufacture, and improvements may be suggested from any quarter. Officers of theAir Ministry must have free access to the Contractors&apos; works and to any government factories in order to gather all the knowledge which has a bearing on design. Butcontracts and production are definitely outside the sphere of a fighting service. Theyare business matters best discharged by a specialized department. The Air ministry should have no relations with Labour (except in the experimental establishments). Itis obvious that the success of a Ministry of Supply depends upon its loyal and skilfulservices in the fighting departments.I therefore approve of the transference of the Technical Department as proposed tothe Air Ministry and have already given directions to approach the Ministry ofSupply accordingly. I do not approve the Air Ministry undertaking the manufacture and production of aeroplanes, engines. &amp;c. This is a function of Supply. It is, ofcourse, understood that the Aircraft Production Department of the Ministry of supply will continue to work as at present in harmony and association with the Air Ministry,and that its head will be represented in the Air Council.I appoint a Committee as follows to consider the above and to advise me in whatway and to what extent these views can be brought into effect : Sir J. Stevenson, Chairman.Sir A. Duckham.General Bagnall-WtldGeneral EllingtonSecretary (Air).Sir J. Masterton Smith.or two other suitable officers.This Committee should meet, if possible, on Tuesday and should report during theweek, in order to enable me to negotiate with the Ministry of Supply for the exacttransference now required.(Initialled)   W.S.C.SECOND REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE POSITIONOF THE AIRCRAFT TECHNICAL AND SUPPLY DEPARTMENTS.Members :Sir James Stevenson, Bt., Chairman.Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B.Brigadier-General E. K. Bagnall-Wild.Major-General E. L. Ellington.Sir Arthur Robinson, K.C.B.Sir James Masterton Smith, K.C.B.Mr. G. Hutchins, Secretary.To the Eight Honourable Winston S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State forWar and Air.Sir,In accordance with the instructions contained in your minute of the 8th February,your Committee have considered the points raised in Sir James Stevensons minute&apos;ofthe 7th February, and beg to make the following recommendations : 1. That the allegiance of the Technical, Inspection and Supply Departments ofthe Air Group of the Ministry of Munitions should be transferred forthwith to the AirMinistry.
Uth February, 1919.2. That so far as the relative responsibility of the Air Ministry and the Ministryof Munitions for contracts and finance is concerned, the Ministry of Munitions should carry out the liquidation of all outstanding aircraft contracts or orders which had beenplaced at the date of the Armistice (including therein all amendments to such contractsor orders placed by the Liquidation of Aircraft Contracts Committee as part of the liquidation settlements), and all payments thereunder should continue to be made bythe Ministry of Munitions. All contracts arising out of demands from the Servicesubsequent to the 11th November, 1918, or out of demands prior to that date for whichorders had not been placed, should be the responsibility of the Air Ministry andarrangements for payment thereunder should be made by that Ministry.8. That the Inspection Department should continue to carry out the necessaryinspection functions for the Ministry of Munitions until deliveries under the contracts for which that Ministry is responsible have been completed.4. That in order to enable the post-armistice contracts to be dealt with by the AirMinistry, C.A. 20 (the Contracts Branch of Aircraft Production specially set up to dealwith these contracts) should be transferred immediately to the Air Ministry andarrangements made for the relative accounting by the Accounts Branch of the AirM inistry.5. That the Secretary of the Air Ministry should forthwith negotiate on these lineswith the Secretary of the Ministry of Munitions in order that the requisite Technical,Inspection, Supply and Contracts staff may be transferred to the Air Ministry at anearly date.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  J. STEVENSON, Chairman.(Signed)   G. HUTCHINS, Secretary.
