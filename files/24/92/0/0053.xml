THE present position of work in the High Court, and indeed in all the Courts, is such as to cause very seriousanxiety to those who are responsible ior the adminis-tration of the law. The falling off in litigation in theKing&apos;s Bench Division of the High Court, which wasmarked during the progress of the war, has come to anend and to it there *has succeeded a very great increasein the number of actions to be tried, raising the total toa figure which not only greatly exceeds that which hashad to be dealt with during the war, but is also a largeadvance upon.the corresponding figures in the years immediately preceding the war. Simultaneously thework of the Divorce Court has sprung by leaps andbounds, so that the number of divorce actions now to be tried is four times that to which the Divorce Court wasaccustomed before the war; probate actions remain attheir previous level; the work of the Admiralty Courthas largely increased, and for the time being at any ratethe Judges of the Court have, in addition to theirordinary work, to deal with Prize cases.When the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 came into operation the number of Judges of the King&apos;s bench division was fifteen, namely, the three Presidents ofthe three Divisions and twelve puisne Judges, or, afterthe consolidation of the three Divisions, the Lord chief justice and fourteen puisne Judges. To this number oneJudge was added in the year 1907, in pursuance of Section18 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876.In 1910 the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1910(10 Ed. VII and 1 Geo. Y, c. 12), provided for the additionof two Judges to the King&apos;s Bench Division, &quot; subject tosuch power of transfer as is under the Supreme Court ofJudicature Act, 1873, mentioned,&quot; and two extra Judgeswere appointed accordingly, raising the number of King&apos;bench Judges to eighteen (Lord Chief Justice andseventeen puisnes). The Act gave power to appointsuccessors to the Judges appointed under it, subject tothe provision that whenever the whole number of puisnesamounts to fifteen or upwards, the vacancy shall not be filled unless and until an address is presented from bothHouses of Parliament representing that the state ofbusiness in the King&apos;s Bench Division requires that&apos;suchvacancy should be filled.In accordance with this provision, the number ofpuisnes was allowed to return to that at which it had stoodbefore the passing of the Act, the operation being com-pleted in 1914, not very long before the outbreak of war.Since that date until now the state of affairs contem-plated by the proviso has not arisen, that is to say, thestate of business in the King&apos;s Bench Division has notbeen such as to require the vacancies to be filled.During the whole period of the war, however,although the King&apos;s Bench work has shrunk, it has not[1321]       &quot; B
been possible to carry that work on except with greatdifficulty. Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division have throughout the war been withdrawn from the Bench for extra-judicial work. The Circuit system, which hascontinued unaltered, has made drains upon the strengthof Judges required in London, and although during thewar work on Circuit, both civil and criminal, has fallenoff, probably to an extent proportionate with the falling off in London, the relief thereby obtained has not beenproportionate, since it has been as necessary as beforefor the Judge to visit the Circuit towns, though not toremain at them so long as when there was much more work. It should be noted that work on Circuit has now returned to, and, so far as crime is concerned, has exceeded, its normal level. Prisoners are at least asnumerous as before the war; and the cases of fraud inconnection with war contracts and taxation involve very long and complicated inquiries into questions of account.It may be hoped that the necessity for withdrawingJudges from the Courts for extra-judicial  duties  hasnow ceased, and that the services of those Judgeswho are still so engaged either wholly or in part may at an early date be restored to the Courts.   The reliefobtained from this return has, however, not yet madeitself fully felt, and indeed the practice to some extentstill continues, directly or indirectly, to affect the amountof judicial power available for judicial purposes.   LordSumner has been only very recently released fromattendance in Paris; Lord Cave is in South Africa;Lord Moulton is engaged on work for the Board ofTrade ; Lord Wrenbury is presiding over the Douglas-Pennant Inquiry; Mr. Justice Sargant is occupied witha series of semi-judicial hearings for the Treasury;Mr. Justice Salter is engaged on a committee under the aliens Act.   Of these Judges only Mr. Justice Salterbelongs to the King&apos;s Bench; but the continued employ-ment of so many judicial personages on  extra-judicialmatters,  and  the  constant  demand   made   in   thecourse of last session and resisted only with greatdifficulty to place other Judges at the disposal ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government for similar purposes, showthat   the   tendency   to   withdraw   Judges   persistsand is likely to do so.   It is highly probable thatin   the   many   complicated   and   difficult   questions arising out  of the war  and  out  of the  problemsot   reconstruction,   it will   not   be   found   possiblealways  to   refrain  from   detaching   Judges   duringthe next few years.   Further, the absence of theseJudges, although not of the King&apos;s Bench, has had aconsiderable indirect detrimental influence upon the workof that Division.   So far as they are members of theHouse of Lords, it has so weakened the judicial strengthof that body and of the Judicial Committee of the privy council, that it.has been impossible to render help to theCourt of Appeal and thereby to set free members of thatCourt to give assistance in their turn in the Courts off first Instance, and it has also rendered it necessary whencasual vacancies arose in the Court of Appeal, to fill themby taking temporarily members of the Kings bench division, or the Chancery Division, instead of supplying the vacancies for the time being from among ex-lord chancellor&apos;s or ex-Lords Justices.A matter exercising as great an effect upon the workof the King&apos;s Bench Division as the absence of King&apos;s
Bench Judges for extra-judicial duties has been thenecessity of supplying King&apos;s Bench Judges for the workof the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division. Thenumber of Judges of the Probate, Divorce, and admiralty division was fixed by the Act of 1873 at two, to whichnumber there has been no addition in the forty-threeyears which have passed since that Act came into effective operation! During those years not only has thepopulation increased enormously, but there has been, orhad been until the commencement of the war, a gradualand almost insensible change in the attitude of large sections of the population towards the questions of marriage and divorce, which was bound sooner or later to be reflected in the work of the Divorce Court.The beginning of the war happened to coincide with thepassing of the rules under which a regular system of increased facilities for litigation was extended to poorpersons in all the divisions of the Court. It is doubtfulwhether the effect of these rules upon litigation in theKing&apos;s Bench and Chancery Divisions has been verygreat. In the Divorce Court, however, the effect of therules combined with changed social conditions arising outof the war has been to increase the work to an extent towhich there is no parallel in. the comparative figures oflitigation in any recent years. In October 1913,528 divorcepetitions were entered for trial. In the present month,2,025 such petitions stand for trial. It must not besupposed that the difference in these figures is repre-sented by arrears. During almost the whole period ofthe war one Judge at least from the Kings bench division has been detached to give assistance to theProbate Division, and very frequently two such Judgeshave been so detached. Every attempt has been madeto deal with the lists as expeditiously as possible. Thework of disentangling from anv particular mass of casesthose which may fairly be said to be arrears is verygreat. The view of the President of the Division is that,so far as divorce cases are concerned, the number whichat the end of last sittings might fairly be regarded asarrears, and which ought to have been disposed of, thatis to say, cases set down and ready for trial, whosehearing was delayed by the absence of a Judge to trythem, is practically negligible.Applying a simple test, the number of divorce petitionsfiled in the nine months from the 1st January to the30th September, 1913, was 918 ; the number so filedin the nine months from the 1st January to the30th September, 1918, was 936 ; the number so filed inthe nine months from the 1st January to the30th September, 1919, was 4,201. The last figure,which includes necessarily only a small proportion ofcases which have already found their way into the listsfor trial, give some indication of the appalling task which lies before the Judges of the Probate Divorce and &apos;Admiralty Division.It must be remembered that if it is possible to choosein respect of urgency between different types oflitigation, divorce cases of all others, perhaps, ought tobe disposed of quickly. This statement, which isprobably true at most times, is especially true at present,when the great bulk of the cases come from classes whoare especially entitled to the protection of the law, andwho, by their social circumstances, find it most difficultto order their lives when suffering from matrimonial
misfortune. It should be remembered, further, that very many of them are the direct product of the war.While the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Divisionhas thus had to deal with, and has now to contemplate,an enormous addition to the task set to it at its constitution, the number of Judges allotted to itremaining i he same, it has had during the war toprovide in addition the whole time of one&apos; Judge atleast for the trial of Prize cases. It may be supposedthat this necessity will very shortly pass away, and thatthe time of, the President, which has been hitherto allbut exclusively devoted to this work, will be set freealtogether for the ordinary work of the Division. Therewill still remain, however, a certain residue which maynot finally be disposed of for several years, and for some little time to come it is probable that the Presidentstime will have to be requisitioned to sit on the JudicialCommittee for the trial of Prize appeals from the Colonia*Courts. It is difficult to estimate the amount of work involved under these two heads.The Admiralty work of the Division has increased ina greater proportion than the divorce work. In 1913twenty-two cases stood for trial on the first day ofMichaelmas Sittings. On the first day of MichaelmasSittings 1918 that number had increased by fairly steadystages to 157. On the first day of these Sittings thefigure was seventy-nine. It is suggested that this reduction (which in itself represents 300 per cent,advance on the 19 J 3 figures) is due to the fact that.ithas been unusually difficult to estimate what Judgeswould be available for Admiralty work this Sittings andimpossible to fix the days for hearing. Admiralty causesmust necessarily be fixed for specific clays and tried on those days, because of the necessity for enabling ships&apos;witnesses to proceed to sea. In present circumstances,there is added to the commercial desirability of fixing the trial of these cases so as to detain ships and seamenin port as little as possible the national need of em-ploying shipping to the fullest possible extent. It maybe noted, in this connection, that there is every reason to suppose that, in spite of the very great increase in thenumber of Admiralty causes heard in the Division, therehas been an even greater increase in the number of cases which have been referred by consent. It is commonknowledge at the Bar that the work of such well-knownadvocates as Mr. Butler Aspinall has so greatly increased in arbitrations that some of them have almost abandoned the practice of appearing in Court.Probate actions show but little variation, but at thepresent moment, owing to the necessity for avoiding longcases which might clog the whole action of the Courts,there are a number of special jury Probate actionsawaiting trial which will take a very large part of thetime of one Judge this Sittings. if he is able to reachthem.It will be observed from the above that two Judgesform a wholly inadequate staff for the Probate, Divorce,and Admiralty Division in present circumstances, or inany circumstances which can reasonably be foreseen.. Itwas the opinion of the late Sir Samuel Evans three yearsago that the time had come when a third Judge shouldbe appointed definitely to the Division, and he antici-pated that, even with this increased strength, it would still be neceseary for him to seek frequent help in the
King&apos;s Bench Division. Since that date matters have got much worse, and, while it may be difficult to fix thenumber of Judges who as a permanence will be requiredin the Division, it is quite clear that four Judges at leastwill have to be employed for as long a period in thefuture as it is possible for reasonable men to foresee insuch matters. As a temporary measure two Judgeshave been lent by the King&apos;s Bench Division to theProbate Division, but their services are required urgentlyfor the King&apos;s Bench work. They have been lentin the expectation that relief will be given to theKing&apos;s Bench Division at a very early date, and unlessthat expectation is fulfilled it will be necessary that theyshould return to their own work.The state of business in the Probate Division hasbeen dealt with at length because of its direct actionupon the work of the remaining Divisions of theCourt. As already stated, the King&apos;s Bench Divisionis two Judges short by reason of the Probate, Divorce,and Admiralty work. It is thus reduced to a strength of fourteen (Lord Chief Justice and thirteenpuisnes). Of these Judges, nine must go on Circuitduring this autumn, and each Judge going on Circuitwill be absent for not less than six weeks, and may possibly be absent for more than two months, leavingfive Judges at the outside to do the work of theKing&apos;s Bench in London without any allowance for sickness or withdrawal for extra-judicial duties.It is therefore necessary to consider how the workwhich these Judges have to face compares with thatwhich has had to be faced in the past, either by eighteenor seventeen Judges as between 1910 and 1914, or bysixteen Judges before 1910 and those dates.At Michaelmas 1909 (the year before that in whichthe state of work in the King&apos;s Bench was such as torequire the passing of the Act of 1910 and the additionof two Judges) the number of cases entered for trialwas 795. The number entered for trial to-day is 857.This latter figure, it is true, was slightly exceeded atMichaelmas 1910, when the figure of 795 just given had-risen to 867. On that date, though the Act had been passed, the Judges appointed under it had not yet comeinto office. Four appointments   those of Bankes,Avory, Horridge, and Lush, JJ.   were made at theend of the Long Vacation of that year, thus raising thenumber of Judges to that allowed by the statute, andno doubt the judicial strength thus constituted had todeal not only with current work, but with a heavy mass of arrears. Their work was so effectual that the numberof cases entered for trial at Michaelmas 1911 was 550.It rose at Michaelmas 1912 to 659, and thence fell by successive stages J9131914191519161917525481385457321rising again in 1918 to 538, and this year to the figureof 857 already given.It must be noted that there are special circumstancesat the present day which lead one to suppose that thefull weight of increased litigation has not yet been felt,
The Courts Emergency Powers Acts have been inoperation during the war and have not yet ceased to operate. It is difficult to trace cause and effect in thesematters, but it is only reasonable to suppose that if aman cannot obtain execution of his judgment in normal course of law, he is likely to be debarred, except in extreme cases, from initiating litigation.Further, the Courts Emergency Powers Act of last session, following the precedent of that of 1917, openedto the Courts an entirely new field of litigation, placingit within their jurisdiction to decide in effect whatremedy, if any, should be given where the non-fulfilment of a contract was due to circumstances arising out ofthe war. There is every reason to believe that thisStatute, for which a warm desire was expressed in the mercantile community, will result in a considerablenumber of applications to the Courts.Apart from this Statute, however, the completeupset of social, financial, and commercial conditionscaused by the war has already produced a large crop of difficulties for which the Courts alone can afford asolution, involving propositions of immense difficulty inlegal construction, large sums of money, and other interests of vast complexity and importance. Such ofthose cases as have already reached the Court of Appealand the House of Lords (many of which are in effectcases of first impressionj require detailed examination ofthe conditions of the.business to which they relate, and very prolonged argument. It is natural to suppose, and indeed it is common knowledge, that many such cases,yet remain to be heard.There is a further reason for supposing that theprospects for the future are even more unfavourable thanthe Cause List suggests. Under the Juries Act, 1918-(8 &amp; 9 Geo. V, c. ^3), a party to an action at nisi priiishas been deprived of his right to a jury except in certainspecified5&apos; classes of action, power being reserved to theCourt on application to order a jury where the action ismore fit to be tried with a jury than without one. Theresult has been enormously to expedite the despatch ofbusiness. It is notorious that a trial with a jury lastslonger than a trial before the Judge alone. Omittingcommercial cases and cases in bankruptcy, in 1913 thecases in the non-jury list&quot; were to the cases in the jurylist roughly as one to thre&apos;e ; in 1918 they were roughly assix to four ; in the present lists they are as ten to one. Itis due to this state of things during 1918 that heavy listsnow before the King&apos;s Bench Division comprise little that can reasonably be called arrears. The Juries Act expires,six months after the termination of the war, and it maybe anticipated with certainty that the number of cases in the non-jury list and jury lists respectively will thenresume their normal ratios to one another. The questionwhether the right to a jury should be restored withoutquabfication requires serious consideration. But, what-ever limits are placed upon the full exercise of that right,there is a great weight of judicial authority in favour ofthe view that the present restrictions cannot be main-tained. Upon the expiry of the Act, therefore, therewill be at once a large increase in the number of jurycases, and a far greater expenditure of judicial time uponthe accomplishment of an equal amount of work.* Note.

It would be lamentable if, during the period of recon-struction, at a time Avhen the public are more thanusually critical of the operations of Government, no effortwere made to cope with the stream of litigation, and togrant to litigants reasonably expeditious trial on the very important matters concerning both property and thepersons described above. Measures are therefore called for which will enable the Courts to grapple with reason-able dispatch with this mass of business.In the first place, it is proposed to take the followingadministrative steps: 1. The number of divorce cases entails, as already stated, an intolerable burden upon Judges of the Probate,Divorce, and Admiralty Division. In addition, the hearing of these cases in many cases inflicts great.hardships uponthe parties, for many of them are poor people.   It mustbe remembered that a divorce petition in order to succeedmust be supported by oral evidence, even if undefended.It is therefore necessary to bring witnesses to london from all over the country, and the consequent expense isin some cases prohibitive, and in others a very greatburden.   It is therefore necessary that some arrange-ment should be made for the local trial of divorce eases.Proposals have been made for committing the jurisdiction,at least in undefended cases, to the County Court.   Itis, however, pointed out that the effect of such a measure would be to place such a burden upon the County Courtas to destroy its usefulness for the purpose for which itwas originally created, that is, a court for the collectionof small debts, and to prevent its development upon thelines upon which it can most usefully assist in theadministration of local justice, that is, by a gradualdevolution upon it of the less important cases or thecases most suitable for local trial which would otherwiseencumber the list of theHigh Court. Further, in the opinionof those most experienced in these matters, the adminis-tration of the law of divorce requires in the interest ofthe community that the Judge should&apos;maintain a fairlyconsistent standard in matters where he is vested withjudicial discretion, and that he should have the assistanceof Counsel and Solicitors who can be relied upon to makethe discovery to the Court which is the tradition of theCourt built up by many years of administration.   Theserequisites can be maintained so long as the law continuesto be administered as at present by the two Judges ofthe Division, and by such King&apos;s Bench Judges as arefrom time to time lent by the King&apos;s Bench Division,and adopt the standard of the judicial bench of theCourt.  It may be safely said that if the administrationof the Divorce Law was committed to the King&apos;s bench division generally a similar result would follow.   It is,however, by no means sure that when the administrationof the law is committed to fifty-five County court judges of various training and antecedents, and subject in the smallest degree to the opinion of their brethren,any consistent standard wrould be observed.   For ,other reasons divorce is not in itself a suitable subject for thejurisdiction of the County Court, and it is thereforefeared that, if this change were made, the result would be unfortunate both to the Court and to the parties,No such objection can be taken to the local trial ofdivorce by Judges from the High Court of Justice. Ithas been suggested that this might be effected by the
addition of Judges permanently to the Divorce Division,and by the Judges of the Court thus strengthenedthemselves going on Circuit to such selected town asBristol, Cardiff or Swansea, Chester, Manchester orLiverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, and Norwich. The objectionto this course is primarily the expense involved, and thefurther waste of judicial time,which would arise from theestablishment of this new kind of Circuit.Cn the other hand, if divorce were added to thematters to be tried on Assize and were dealt with by the judges travelling the Circuit for civil business as a normal part of the business to be done, the loss of judicialtime would be re luced to a minimum. There is nothing in the nature of divorce proceedings which makes themunfit to be heard by the ordinary Judge of the KingsBench Division, and so long as the Circuit systemcontinues in operation it is an advantage rather thanotherwise, from the point of view of time, that the work should be done in the country rather than in London;on the other hand, the saving of expense to litigantswould be enormous, while the increase in expense to national or local funds in consequence of the length ofthe stay of the Judge in the Assize town would not be great. There must, however, be some limit to this operation. Obviously it would be impracticable to incur the risk that a King&apos;s Bench Judge (or, indeed, anyJudge of the High Court) might be detained in thecountry to try a special jury divorce case lasting overdays or even weeks. Such an event would dislocate themachinery of the High Court for a prolonged period. Itis, therefore, suggested that, in the first place at least,the cases to be tried on Circuit should be those in whichthe petitioner has been admitted under the Poor PersonsRules and those which are undefended. These two classes of cases are those in which hardship generallyarises. It may be found possible hereafter to deal in similar fashion with other cases in which a local venue is appropriate.It is, therefore, proposed that local cases, could asa rule be tried locally by the Judge going the Assize.The question whether this can be effected without legis-lation is somewhat obscure. It would appear possible by taking advantage of Section 12* of &quot; The MatrimonialCauses Act, 1857 &quot; (20 &amp; 21 Viet. c. 85) that the court should hold its sittings at the several Assize towns andthen that the King&apos;s Bench Judges on the Assize shouldbe transferred to the Probate, Divorce, and admiralty division under the Judicature Act for the purposeof hearing the case and pronouncing a decree.Such a proceeding, however, would be very cumbrous,and it appears desirable on technical grounds thatthe change should be effected by legislation. Andas the proposal in fact goes beyond what was contemplated when the Statute was framed, it seemsproper that it should have the sanction of Parliament.In any event, it will be necessary to make such provisionby rule as will ensure that the change is effectual, andthat country cases of the classes specified are in fact triedin the country in the absence of good cause to thecontrary.* Note. Section 12 is as follows: &quot; The Court for divorce and matrimonial causes shall hold itssittings at such place or places in London or Middlesex, or elsewhere,as Her Majesty in Council shall from time to time appoint.&quot;
This proposal, though it would confer great advan-tages upon litigants and would be a great measure of relief to the Judges of the Probate, Divorce, and admiralty Division, would not in any way assist in solving the real problem. It merely shifts the burdenfrom one set of shoulders to another.2. It is, therefore, proposed that some further effort should be made to save judicial time by the abolition ofCircuit towns at those places where there is very little or no business on Assize. In present circumstances thereis power, which is exercised, to eliminate towns from theCircuits of Judges on the Winter and Spring Assizes,and accordingly in the normal course no Assize is heldin certain counties during these Circuits. *It is suggested that the time has now come, havingregard to the change in the relative density of population in the country, when some at least, if not all, of the places dealt with by Orders in Council made under theWinter Assizes Acts should disappear altogether fromthe list of Assize towns. In addition, it is worth con-sideration whether other towns might not also be dealtwith in similar fashion.!These changes will result in some slight saving of judicial time, proportionate to the number of placeseliminated, and a very considerable saving in expense.In some of the places, for example, Appleby, there is nolonger a gaol. Westmoreland prisoners, therefore, ifthere are any, are confined in Carlisle gaol, and when the judge goes to Appleby the prisoners, at considerable expense and trouble, have to be fetched from Carlisle toAppleby for trial and taken back again. The gaol atAppleby was abolished some little time ago, and in thecourse of the war several further gaols in the smallerplaces have also been dismantled or converted intomilitary prisons.^ Westmoreland prisoners tried atCarlisle are tried before a Cumberland jury, and simi-larly, Huntingdon prisoners are tried before Cambridgejuries. The matter is not perhaps of great importance,since the prisoners are very few in number; but if these places cease to be Assize towns, it is only just that theinhabitants of the county which provides the criminalshould bear in due proportion with the county where the prisoner is tried the burden of finding jurymen for thepurpose.Any attempt to deal with this matter by legislation will no doubt provoke considerable opposition. It ispossible that the reform might be effected by Order inCouncil without recourse to legislation. Even if any formal rights subsist, they have been so far cut down inpractice that no real question of principle remains.Purists might argue that the course proposed is contrary toMagna Charta,$ and it is certainly contrary to very ancientcustom. The law is by no means clear, and to saveany possibility of a mistake, it seems on the whole morejudicious to deal with the matter by legislation. such legislation might perhaps take the form of givingpower by Order in Council to abolish any particular* Note.

Assize town, and to make any necessary consequentialarrangements.3. At the same time it is proposed that an effort shouldbe made to devolve further work from the High Court uponthe County Court. The Cabinet has already approved theintroduction of a County Court Bill, which, besidesmaking certain small changes in County Court procedure,simplifies, and to some extent amplifies, the power ofthe High Court to remit suitable actions to the county court. The Bill was so drawn as to avoid raising anyquestion which could reasonably be regarded as con-controversial, and. its provisions dealing with the questionof remitter were so designed as substantially to carryout proposals made by a committee ot High court judges in 1918. It is now proposed, having regard tothe urgent necessity for lightening the work of theHigh Court, to include in the Bill two provisions whichmay be regarded as of a controversial nature, but whichshould have some effect in reducing the number oftrivial actions in tort in the High Court. Accordingly,it is proposed that power should be given to remit casesof tort where the amount in dispute does not exceed100L This proposal has the strong support of the law society. It is also proposed that the plaintiff, whether in tort or contract, should&apos; be placed at a furtherpecuniary disadvantage if he brings in the High Courtan action which should properly be brought in the county court. As the law now stands, the plaintiff in tortin the High Court who recovers less than &apos;20l. is onlyentitled to costs on the Countv Court scale., It isproposed to raise this figure to 501. The plaintiff incontract is entitled to no costs if he recovers less than201. in the High Court. It is proposed to raise this figure to 40Z. In both cases a dispensing power isreserved to the Judge trying the case.4. As already stated, the question of what should bedone to meet the situation arising from the expiry ofthe Juries Act, 1919, requires early consideration. Itis not thought possible to maintain in their entirety therestrictions imposed by that Act upon the right of ajury. On the other hand, the view held by many beforethe war that the ri^ht was too wide has been strengthened by the experience gained while the Act has been inoperation. It is suggested that a middle course shouldbe adopted, and while the absolute right is preserved inthe cases specified in the Act, the right in other cases should be subject to the discretion of the Court. It ispossible that the Judicature Acts confer upon tho RuleCommittee power to do this by rule. The question was discussed before the Bill for the Juries Act was drafted.But it was than felt that, apart from legal technicalities,the right to a jury at nisi prius was of such longstanding that, as a matter of constitutional propriety,it should be touched, if at all, only by Statute, thoughthe Statute could conveniently confer in express wordsupon the Rule Committee power by rule to determine the cases and the manner in which judicial discretionshould be exercised.The total effect of the changes thus proposed as measured in judicial time cannot be predicted withaccuracy, and it seems wise not to attempt to make anestimate. It is, however, obvious that it cannot result inremedying the difficulty with which the Courts have to contend.   As already pointed out, the trial of divorce
cases ou Circuit, while it will relieve the Judges of theProbate Division, has no effect upon the total amount ofwork clone by the Judges of tho Probate Division andthe King&apos;s Bench Division taken together. Indeed, sofar as the Kings Bench Division is concerned, it laysupon that Division a very heavy additional burden. Ifit is found possible to eliminate frpm the list of Circuittowns all those towns which have formed the subject ofOrders in Council under the Winter Assizes Acts, the gross result would be to get rid of ten* or, if Hertford,Hereford, and Warwick also be added, thirteen Assizetowns, a saving of thirteen days- twice a year, ortwenty-six days.f This is not a net saving, becauseoccasions arise on which there is no business at some ofthese towns, and therefore under the operation of &quot; TheAssizes and Quarter Sessions Act, 1908,&quot; no visit need be paid to them, or some of them, in any event. It is obviously impossible to predict the number ot cases inwhich the Court will exercise its power to remit actions for tort under 100L, or in which the prohibition to receivecosts on the High Court scale where less than 50L isrecovered will operate to deter plaintiffs from proceeding in the High Court. It can, however, hardly be hopedthat the effect of these two latter measures can be to balance the vast increase in divorce cases. There will still remain for the King&apos;s Bench Division the necessity to supply the time of two Judges for the Divorce Court,whether by actually detaching two Judges to sit in thatCourt in London or by the additional work entailed onCircuit, besides a very great increase in the normal workof the Division. Lastly, any modification of the law asto juries will only mitigate the result of the expiration of the provisions of the Juries Act.In these circumstances, it appears imperative thatthere should be an immediate substantial increase in thenumber of Judges. It has been a matter of anxiousconsideration whether it was not the duty of those responsible to propose the permanent addition of at least one Judge to the Probate Division, and simultaneouslythe exercise of the power conferred by the JudicatureAct, 1910, to propose addresses for the addition of twoJudges to the King&apos;s Bench Division. If litigation ismaintained at its present volume, some such proposal will be inevitably necessary. The addition of a permanentJudge to the Probate Division would enable the&apos;work ofthat Division to be regularised and carried on with greater convenience to litigants than can be the case solong as that 1 Kvision has to depend, in order to grapplewith its work, upon such assistance as the King&apos;s bench division may be able to render. Part of the work of the division that concerned with Admiralty requires forits proper despatch that the date w7hen a Judge will beavailable should be known many weeks beforehand, andit is extremely difficult to make fixtures for any date inthe future so long as the number of Judges is uncertain.No doubt lack of certainty in this matter causes greatinconvenience and financial loss to the commercialcommunity. A similar lack of certainty as to the Judgeby whom, and the time when, any particular cause would* Note.-Appleby, Oakham, Huntingdon, Newtown or Welshpool,&apos;Dolgelly, Mold, Beaumaris, Havet ford west, Lampeter, Presteign.t Note. The average amount of work done at the towns men-tioned is shown in Appendix IV.
be disposed of, together with that delay which is now,unhappily, again present, led in the past to a dis-inclination on the part of those engaged in commerce tohave recourse to the regular Courts for the settlement oftheir disputes. They were, therefore, forced to a systemof private arbitrations and references which was possiblymore expeditious but was certainly no less expensive.An attempt lo remedy this evil was made by theestablishment of the Commercial Court. With therecurrence of the causes, similar disinclination to resort to the Courts now manifests itself, and can only be curedby an application of a similar remedy, that is, by providing certainty and despatch.The addition ot a Judge permanently to the ProbateDivision would, however, require legislation, and such acourse is open to the criticism both that legislation inthe present state of Parliamentary business wouldinvolve unnecessary delay in a matter in whichpromptitude is of importance, and that the result might possibly (though I think very improbably) be toprovide more Judge power than would prove to benecessary permanently or to provide it in the wrongplace. This criticism is perhaps strengthened by thefact that the proposal to send divorce to be tried onCircuit is in its nature experimental, and if it fails it maybe necessary to make other provision for the purpose.In all the circumstances, therefore, though not with-out some fear that the remedy may prove insufficient forthe difficulty, it is proposed that recourse should be had only to the provisions of the Act of 1910. That Act waspassed when, as shown in this memorandum, the need was far less than it is at the present day. It thereforelimits the amount of extra Judges who may be appointedto two, and there are grave reasons for thinking that allthe available evidence points to the necessity of not lessthan three. It appears expedient, however, to be contentfor the time being with the number of two. The provisionsof the Act of 1910 are elastic. If it should be found thatthey are insufficient for the purpose, it will be possiblehereafter to go to Parliament for further assistance andto initiate legislation. If the fears expressed in thismemorandum should be falsified, the provisions of theAct will ensure the automatic return to the presentnumber of Judges. Taking a loose average, vacanciesoccur in the King&apos;s Bench Division about once in every year. When the address has been presented and thetwo Judges have been appointed, it will therefore beopen to Parliament about once in every twelve months to review the situation and to consider upon the occurrence of each vacancy whether the state of work isstill such as to require the vacancy to be filled. as already pointed out, it may prove that the permanentaddition of a Judge to the Probate Division is necessary and that such an addition makes it unnecessary tocontinue to retain the number of King&apos;s Bench Judgesat the increased figure. In that event it will be possibleto suppress one or more of the new Judgeships in theKing&apos;s Bench Division upon vacancies occurring and to seek the authority of Parliament for the appointment ofa third Probate Judge.The proposal for an addition to the number of Judgeswill be subject to the criticism that two high salariedposts are being created at a moment when it is universallyadmitted that economy is essential.   It is unnecessary
to labour in reply to this criticism the arguments alreadyadduced for the proposal, but it may be pointed out inaddition that an increase in the number of Judges doesnot result in a net addition to national expenditureequivalent to the salaries of the Judges appointed. Ifthe increase in the number of Judges results in more work being done, it will also bring in more business andmore fees.Further criticism may be based upon the condition ofaffairs in the Chancery Division. A letter in the&quot;Times&quot; of 28th October states that &quot;the work inthe Chancery Division is not sufficient to occupy sixJudges; four could do it with reasonable ease, and it isonly by very skilful window dressing that a show ofwork in its Courts is kept up.&quot;There is sufficient force in this criticism to call for a detailed explanation of the situation. The facts are asfollows: (1.) There has been of late years a continuous falling off in the work of the Chancery Division : 369 cases were set down for hearing in the Division at Michaelmas1913. The number had fallen to 301 at Michaelmas1916 and 246 at Michaelmas 1917. Then there begana very slight tendency to increase, the number set down for Michaelmas this year being 263. When the numbersunder consideration are so much smaller than those withwhich the Kings Bench Division is concerned, moreviolent fluctuation must be expected, and the additionor subtraction of a very small number is sufficient toproduce a very large percentage of variation. It mustbe remembered that the Judges of the Chancery Division,to a greater extent than the Judges of the King&apos;bench Division, are occupied otherwise than in tryingactions, and the effects of the changes in procedure ofrecent years make it specially difficult to form anycomparative table which would give an accurate idea ofthe work of one year as contrasted with another.When due allowance has been made, however, it is hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that the workbefore the Chancery Division at this moment is con-siderably less than it was at the corresponding datebefore the war.(2.) It is very improbable that the Chancery workwill remain at the level to which it has fallen during thewar. The work in the King&apos;s Bench, which had fallen to an equal or greater degree in proportion, has alreadypassed the pre-war limit. The Chancery work shows anincrease which as yet is very slight. But everythingpoints to the conclusion that the same causes arisingfrom the war, which reduced the King&apos;s Bench work,have reduced the Chancery work, and that the Chancerywork, though more slowly, will follow the same course asthe King&apos;s Bench work has done, now that those causeshave been removed. For years before the war, though there were fluctuations, there was no such variation inthe figures as would induce one to believe that, takingone year with another, the amount of work to be doneby the Division had actually shrunk in volume. Up tothe year 1899 the complaints of delay in the ChanceryDivision and of the consequent accumulation of arrearswere constant and justified. In that year the sixthChancery Judgeship was created and Mr. Justice Farwellwas appointed on the 28th November.   The result was
immediate. 405 actions were left pending in theChancery Division at the end of the year 1899. that number had fallen to 278 at the end of the year 1900.It fell further to 140 at the end of 1901, to 126 atthe end of the year 1902, and 138 at the end of theyear 1903. Meanwhile naturally enough the number of actions actually heard increased to 575 in 1899, to 679in 1900 (while the main body of arrears was beingdisposed of), and then fell towards the normal by stages of 603 in 1901, 612 in 1902, and 55&apos;5 in 1903. If theanticipation here expressed, that the Chancery work will follow, though perhaps slowly, the upward course takenby the King&apos;s Bench work is justified, the result of the suppression of a Chancery Judgeship would be to produceagain the state of aftairs before the sixth Judge wasappointed.In considering these figures it must be borne inmind that while the fluctuation in the number of actionscorresponds roughly to the fluctuation in the total workof the Division, the time of each Judge, broadly speaking,is occupied only as to one half in trying actions, and asto the remaining half in the other work of the Division.(3.) Mr. Justice Farwell&apos;s appointment was followedby a change in procedure, that is to say, by the initiation of the system of linked Judges. This system contem-plates the grouping together of the Chambers of the judges in sets of two, and the division of work betweenthe Judges to whom each set is assigned, one Judgetaking witness actions, and one Judge non-witnessactions, administrative work, adjourned summonses, andinterlocutory work, throughout the term. Under theprevious arrangements, by which each Judge dealt withthe witness and non-witness actions arising in hisChambers in separate lists, perpetual uncertainty and delay was caused owing to the impossibility of foreseeingexactly the length of each action. It is to the institution of this system that thqse most experienced in the workof the Chancery Division attribute the excellent state towhich the business of that Division was brought afterthe appointment of a sixth Judge; and it is the opinionof most of these authorities that, if the system isabandoned be the number of Judges what it may theChancery work will return to the chaotic condition inwhich it was before 1899. This was the opinion of LordBuckmaster when he considered the question of fillingthe vacancy eventually occupied by Mr. Justice Peterson.It was again considered by Lord Finlay before theappointment of Mr. Justice P. O. Lawrence. In both cases those Lord Chancellors had before them a falling offin the work of the Division, and no such prospect of increase as appears now to hold itself out. Lord Buck-master was acting upon his own intimate knowledge ofthe affairs of the Division. Lord Finlay acted on adviceafter consulting those best qualified to advise him in thematter. In particular, the late Master of the Rolls held the strongest possible opinion that the work could onlybe conducted by the linked system.(4.) The question, therefore, in effect is not whetherthe number of Chancery Judges should be five or six, but whether it should be four or six. Four Judges would be unable to cope with the work of the Chancery Division,even as it stands at present; and even if the amount ofwork decreased and was - followed by a subsequentincrease, or by any congestion in the King&apos;s Bench
Division such as might arise from increased work or fromillness, there would be no reserve strength ami ng the judges of the High Court. There can be no doubt,therefore, that if this question were put to anyone whohad an intimate knowledge of the work of the Division,there could be only one answer, and if the idea of reducingthe number to four is rejected (as in my clear opinion itmust be), the question of whether it should be maintained at six is settled.(5.) There is a further point. The Chancery division in present circumstances affords the only reserve strengthavailable at the Courts. It has been pointed out that,while the necessities of the present case may be met bythe appointment of two King&apos;s Bench Judges, some doubts will remain as to whether the strength of theKing&apos;s Bench thus augmented will be able to deal withall possible emergencies. If they are unable to do so, itis to the Chancery Division alone that recourse can be had. Assistance from that Division during the last fewyears has enabled, and has been the only expedient that could enable, the work- of the Court of Appeal to becarried on in face of the numerous vacancies caused byretirement or illness. Further, the Judges of theChancery Division have repeatedly rendered assistanceto the King&apos;s Bench by taking non-jury cases, and theyhave continued this practice until it appeared to themthat the work of their Division was in peril of falling sofar into arrear that they were no longer capable of givingassistance outside it. The Chancery Judges remainready; whenever the state of their own work allows, torender assistance either to the Court of Appeal or to theKing&apos;s Bench Division, or to undertake any otherjudicial work.There remains for consideration the question whetherCourt fees in the High Court should not be increased.v The fall in the value of money results in the fact thatthe services rendered by the Court are remuneratedperhaps for 50 per cent, of the fee previously received.Further, in every other matter relating to the lawexpenses have increased enormously. An addition hasbeen made to the fees chargeable by solicitors, lawprinting has increased in cost, the fees earned byadvocates are enormously in excess of those earnedprevious to the war, and the sums of money at stake in commercial matters and, generally speaking, the verdictsfound by juries in actions of tort have increased out of proportion to pre-war figures. It appears anomalous inthese circumstances that the High Court alone amongpractically all the institutions of the country shouldcontinue to do its work at a less cost to those who takeadvantage of it than before the war. Even before thewar High Court fees were very small as contrasted withCounty Court fees, and were unduly low even if it beconsidered that County Court fees were unduly high.The present state of affairs lays a premium upon thecommencement of an action in the High Court ratherthan in the County Court. It is true that in anysubstantial matter the Court fee is so small in proportion to the total expenses of litigation, that even if it weredoubled it would not afford a deterrent. So long as the ,principle is maintained whereby the administration ofjustice is regarded as a legitimate charge upon the
parties, and not upon the State, the High Court feesmight well bear a very large increase without the smallest hardship to anyone. *BIEKENHEAD.November 4, 1919.APPENDIX I.The history of the Assize system in recent years isdifficult to describe plainly, because of the puzzlingvariations in the nomenclature applied from time totime to the separate Assizes in common parlance and bythe legislature. It may be stated most plainly asfollows: There is an Assize in the Autumn beginning aboutthe beginning of Michaelmas Term, which is referred toin the Winter Assizes Acts, 1876 and 1877, as theWinter Assize, but commonly called the Autumn Assize.In the beginning of the calendar year, about the com-mencement of Hilary Term, another Assize starts whichis usually spoken of as the Winter Assize, but is not subject to the provisions of the Winter Assize Act.Some time in the Spring there is a third Assize, calledboth popularly and by the legislature the Spring Assize;and in Trinity Term there is a fourth Assize,&quot; calleduniversally the Summer Assize.From time immemorial the Judges have visited everycounty twice in every year.The 18th century added a third Assize, and the19th century a fourth, both of the two last namedbeing limited to certain specified places. It seems to bea constitutional dogma, if no more, that there is an obligation to hold two Assizes in every county in every year, subject, of course, to the operation of any dispensingStatute.The places at which the original Assizes were heldwere originally the chief county towns, there being atleast one such place in every county at every Assize,and apparently not more than one.The Act of 3 and 4 Wm. IV, c. 71, gave power byOrder in Council to add to the number of Assize townsin any county, and to divide the county so as to giveeffect to its provisions. Under this provision Orders inCouncil have added Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham,and Leeds to the places at which Assizes are to be held for the counties in which they are situated.The Judicature Act, 1875 (38 and 39 Viet,, c. 77),by Section 23 gave a very wide power to alter the places for holding Assizes, the words used being so widethat if that provision stood alone it might be argued that it was open to the King by Order in Councilentirely to abolish an Assize County, and appoint a placein another County as that at which the gaol delivery inthe first-named County should take place. Wide as thewords are, however, thev have never been interpreted asconferring this power.&quot; The Winter Assizes Acts, 1876 and 1877 &quot; (which as already stated refer not to what is usually called the* Note. See Appendix V.
Winter Assize but to the Assize which takes place in theautumn) give power by Order in Council to eliminate, forthe purposes of that Assize, any particular Assize town,and to unite the county whose town is thus eliminatedwith a neighbouring county for Assize purposes, the trial taking place at the Assize town in the neighbouringcounty. Under this statute the following arrangements have been made for purposes of the Winter (or as it ismore usually called the Autumn) Assize in every year: 1. The Northern Circuit.   Appleby abolished andWestmoreland united with Cumberland to form WinterAssize County No. 1, the Assize town being Carlisle.2. Midland Circuit. Oakhamabolished and Rutland-shire united with Leicestershire to form Winter AssizeCounty No. 2, the Assize town being Leicester.3. South-Eastern Circuit.   Huntingdon abolished and Huntingdonshire united with Cambridgeshire to formWinter Assize County No. 3, the Assize town beingCambridge.4. North Wales Circuit. Newtown or Welshpool,Dolgelly and Mold abolished, and the counties ofMontgomeryshire, Merioneth, Denbigh, and Mint unitedto form Winter Assize County No. 4, the Assize townbeing Ruthiii.5. Beaumaris abolished and the counties of Angleseyand Carnarvon united to form Winter Assize CountyNo. 5, the Assize town being Carnarvon.6. South Wales Circuit.   Haverfordwest andLampeter abolished and the counties of Carmarthen,Pembroke, and Cardigan united to form Winter AssizeCounty, No. 6, the Assize town being Carmarthen(including in its operation the gaol deliveries for the separate Counties of the Borough of Carmarthen andHaverfordwest),7. Presteign abolished and Breconshire and Radnor-shire united to form Winter Assize County No. 7, theAssize town being Brecon.In each of these cases the jurymen, whether Grandor Petty, of the county whose county town becomes thecounty town of the artificial county, are required by theOrder to act as jurymen for the united county, theabsorbed county escaping. A similar obligation applies to the sheriff, except as respects the carrying out of anycapital sentence passed on a prisoner from the absorbedcounty.The operations under &quot; The Spring Assizes Act, 1879,&quot;are more limited. The Spring Assize is now held onlyin Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the Order in council made under the Spring Assizes Act as regards Lan-cashire merely abolishes Lancaster and absorbs that partof the county in the Manchester part, with trial at manchester, and, as regards Yorkshire, abolishes Yorkand absorbs the York part of the county in the Leedspart with trial at Leeds.In 1908, &quot;The Assizes and Quarter Sessions Act, 1908&quot;(8 Ed. VII, c 41), provided a further means of avoiding the holding of. Assizes at places where there was nobusiness. This Act differs from the Winter AssizesActs and the Spring Assizes Act in that it refers to^anyAssize. It provides in effect that if five days before the commission Day there is no business to be done at aparticular Assize town, the Assize need not be held.   If
APPENDIX II.Warwick, whose businesss has largely left it to go toBirmingham, might be added to the list of towns to be abandoned as Assize towns, and the whole of the criminal work from Hertfordshire, part of which alreadyfalls within the jurisdiction of the Central CriminalCourt, might also go to that Court and Hertford also be abandoned.It is probable that from almost every part of thecountry it is as easy to get to the Central CriminalCourt as to the town of Hertford itself. While these changes are in contemplation, it seems also desirable toconsider the case of Monmouthshire. The bulk of thebusiness in that county both civil and criminal comqsfrom the south of the county, in the neighbourhood ofNewport. The Assize town is Monmouth, which is notvery accessible, and is removed from the centre of thepopulation. It is suggested (as was recommended bythe Commission on Delay in the Kings Bench Division)that Newport should be substituted for Monmouth asthe Assize town for the county. Possibly it might benecessary at the same time to consider some such arrange-ment for the meeting at Newport of the Bars of theSouth Wales and Oxford Circuits as prevails at Birming-ham between the Oxford and Midland Circuit Bars.This change can certainly be affected by Order in Council,but it seems so germane to the matter under consideration that it might well be dealt with now.APPENDIX III.The gaols at Huntingdon, Oakham, Appleby,Beaumaris, Lampeter. Mold, Dolgelly, Welshpool,Newtown, Pre^teign^ and Hertford have been closed.. The gaol at Hereford has been closed and will probably not been reopened. The gaol at Warwick is stated to be closed &quot;for the present.&quot; There are many other Assizetowns in England at which there is no gaol. So far asthe prison service is concerned, it will be clear gain toget rid of Assizes at any of those towns where the prisonhas been permanently closed. For the purpose of com-mittal for trial, all prisons are now interchangeable,subject to the Home Secretary&apos;s directions (see &quot; criminla justice Administration Act, 1914,&quot; Section 17 (2) (3) ).subsequently business arises, which would have beentried at the Assize if it had been held, the committingJustices may send the prisoner concerned to some otherAssize town on the Circuit.

AtAppleby in 1910 the one criminal case occupied 2 hours 20 minutes andthe civil case   hour, a total of work amounting to 2 hours 35 minutes.In the summer of 1911 the two criminal cases took 4 hours, and theone civil case 40 minutes. In the winter of 1914 when there were noprisoners the civil case occupied 10 minutes. In the Winter Assize of1916 the one prisoner occupied 2  hours. In the summer of 1917 theone prisoner occupied 50 minutes. In the winter of 1918 the oneprisoner occupied   hour. In the summer of 1918 the one prisoneroccupied 40 minutes. There is no reason to suppose that theexperience of other Assize towns differs from this, and it will be observed that the Judge frequently visits one of these towns occupyingnot less than two days in the process, for an almost infinitesimal amountof work measured in time.APPENDIX IV.
APPENDIX V.fhe following table shows in broad outline thedifference in the fees charged in the High Court and theCounty Court respectively. It must be borne in mind that while the High Court fee commands the services ofa more highly skilled and a more expensive judiciarystaff, the services rendered for the County Court fee arein some respects more comprehensive.Principal Fees in High Court and county court.High Court.(Claim unlimited.)County Court (ordinaryjurisdiction).(Claim not over  100.)Actions which go by Default.Writ of summonsAffidavit nf serviceSearch for appearanceJudgment  s.d.0 10 00 2 60 1 00 10 0Office copy of judgment 0  0 fi1  4 0A.

Claim not over  50    Freeallowed.If it is decided to increase the High Court fees, itwill be necessary to examine in detail each fee set out inthe Fee Orders. In practice, however, the revenueearned by the Courts is produced mainly from threesources, namely, the fee on the writ or originatingsummons by which the action is commenced, the fee onentry for trial, and the ad valorem fee on taxation. In1913 there were issued from the Central Office of theHigh Court about 42,000 writs or other originatingprocess, each of which attracted a fee of 10s., producingroughly a gross income of 21,000L In the same yearabout 2,700 actions were entered for trial in the two divisions, each attracting a fee of 21. These&apos; figuresdisregard some unusual forms of proceeding whichattract a larger fee at their inception. They take no account of writs or originating summonses issued out of district registries or of cases entered for trial in thecountry. It will be observed that the number of casesentered for trial is but a small proportion of all theproceedings started. Of the cases entered for trial inthe year 1913, 72 per cent, in the Kings Bench and82 per cent, in Chancery were in fact tried.
Fees on successive steps in an action, such as thesummons for directions and the Order made thereupon,for subpcenaes. filing of affidavits, &amp;c, are taken or notaccording to the stage reached by the action before it isdiscontinued. If it is tried out, the final fees taken arethe Associated certificate (U.) and Judgment (11.),It is obvious that, if it is sought to obtain a sub-stantial increase in the total amount of money collected,the only course is to increase the fee on the writ ororiginating summons. If this fee were doubled and business remained at the 1913 level, an immediate increase in revenue of 2O,0O0Z. would be obtained. It isdifficult to see what hardship would arise from such anincrease in the fee. The plaintiff in an action involving a small sum has the option of proceeding in the county court. Where a large sum is at stake, the increase of10^. forms a negligible percentage. The fee, however,of all those taken, which may most justly be con-sidered inadequate in many cases is the 21. on entry for trial. This fee covers the work done on filing thepleadings in the action, all the routine work of preparingand looking after the lists, and, together with the certifi-cate and judgment fees, the services of the Judge forhearing the action. However many days the action mayoccupy, the fee remains the same. It is a matter for moreexpert consideration whether this fee could not beincreased substantially and possibly made dependentupon the number of days on which the case occupies thetime of the Court.
