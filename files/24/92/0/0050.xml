to1/1Secret.4 ^ the J^oESffiLSL&apos;3 q^OI?0&quot;-Vhat,.: ;&apos;fKViceroy, Army Department, Lo Secretary of Stale for India,31st October 1919.(Received 3rd November, 10.30 a,m.)14829.   31st October.  Malleson wires 29th October :-&quot; Some clays ago two men, variously reported as Turkish and (corrupt group),were discovered with maps and compasses examining routes in district north ofShirvan. They were arrested and are en route for Meshed. During the last few daysBolsheviks have been making systematic examination of all routes into Khorassanbetween Artik and Chacha. On the frontier it is common belief chat Bolshevikscontemplate entering Khorassan, but 1 await further evidence on the subject&quot; 2. Agent arrived to-day from Merv, states the belief common there thatBolsheviks intend .serious (group omitted) in Khorassan in few weeks time and thatcollection of animal transport is with that object.&quot; 3. Bolsheviks who are not well informed regarding present position in Caucasusand on Caspian, imagine that if they secure Krasnpvodsk they will command Caspianand get in touch with Azerbaijan Republic. They count on strong Turkish and pro-Turkish influence in that Government resulting in invasion of Persia.&quot; 4. In event of any Bolshevik demonstration on Khorassan frontier it will bedesirable either to arrest or put under security leading members of Caucasus TurkishCommunity in Meshed and Kuchan.&quot; I am consulting Consul-General about this.&quot; 5. To what extent Afghans are participating in supposed Bolshevik designs isnot. clear at present. There are no signs of movement at Herat, but frontier iszealously closed. Reports received to-day from Jam says Afghan troops fromMazar-i-Sherifm, coming via Maimana, are expected in Herat province shortly.Confirmation awaited. In Herat it is apparently considered that the expectedBolshevik plenipotentiary Suric is bearer of important matter.&quot;6. It is of course possible that, whilst letting rumours get about of design onKhorassan, Bolsheviks are collecting transport and troops either (a) for opening up the route to Termez now closed by Bokhara ; or (b) march right round volunteers withdesign of rounding them up and seizing Krasnovodsk, to capture of which they attachgreatest importance.&quot;
