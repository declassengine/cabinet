The Board determined adversely to all theobj elections,When an estate subject to tithe rentcharge is sold in lots,it not infrequently happens that the auctioneer informally apportionsthe total amount of the rentcharge to which the estate is liableamongst the various lots without reference to the existing legalapportionment under the Tithe acts.     Tithe rentcharge is net chargedat a fixed rate per acre, but at rates -which differ widely in any given Parish, and consequently when an application is made to theBoard for a legal altered apportionment there is often considerabledifficulty in adopting the informal arrangement as the basis of thelegal altered apportionment.In the case cf one altered apportionment now in progress,effecting land in Harrowby (Lincoln) the difficulties arising fromthe existence of a previous informal apportionment are accentuated by the sale of portions of the 3and since the informal apportionmentwas made, and information as to the conditions under which the subsequent sales were made is proving difficult to obtain.     Inthis particular case one of the landowners is pressing for thetransfer from his property to that of another landowner of titherentcharges , the capital value of which is about  1600 on the groundthat such transfer would be in accordance with the informal localarrangement.     The Board are collecting information with a view to considering to what extent, if any, it will be practicable to adoptthe informal arrangement.The Godstone -ural District Council have applied to theBoard fcr their sanction to a proposal that the \rray Huts now onLirapsfield Common should bo taken over by the Local HousingAuthority for housing purposes pending the completion of the housing scheme for the District.     The Board have explained that they haveno pover to give an effective sanction to any such temporary arrange-?ment and have suggested that, if practicable, the Council should endeavour to arrange with the Army Council for the temporary use ofthe Huts for the purpose proposed.

For the purpose of conveniencein --taking the declaration required under the Order certain &quot;standards -of germination&quot; are specified.     These standards are intended torepresent a good average percentage of germination, but in practicethey are being taken to indicate the minimum percentage of germinationAri-unjemente are, therefore, beins made to issue an Amending Orderreducing the &quot;standards&quot; to include the seed which, although capableof producing a moderately good crop, has been difficult to sell up tothe present owing to its capacity of germination being slightly &apos; &apos;below the original &quot;Standards&quot;.Transport.   The agricultural Organization society are appointing a Committee to consider what steps Agricultural Co-operative Societiescan take toi improve the transport of agricultural produce by road,aid r.dl, and have asked that a representative of the Board should beominoted as a member of tnia Committee.Serious complaints have oeen received during the weekf shortage of wagons for carriage of basic slag.

University of. Copenhagen Frrpe-eed Interchange of Students. j Dr, Vincent Naeser "nas pu t forward in general outline an interesting proposal for the interchange of students between Great Britain I and Penmark. Hisidea is that some thing in the naturo of a stotier school sheuld be held in Copenhagen during the month of September

\ which British students might attend, and that similarly one cf the British Universities or Colleges might institute a course, say&apos; during the month of October, which would be attended by selected

\ Danish students. The scheme appears ta offer considerable possibilities of usefulness in connection with Agricultural Education. Further particulars are expected after the scheme has boon worked out in detail by Dr, Naeser on his- return to lenmark,

Farm^Inrbitutes - "Typo" plans for New Building proposals.

Further ccneidcrati"aa lias been given t o tne question of the

preparation of a 15type51 plan wnioh might be sent to Local

Authorities who ainc for the Board7 a advice on the question of Farm

A :ityvo, i

Institute accornrecuti ont P-a&apos;n based on the plan prepared by the Board&apos;&apos;s Super-intending Arehilnet in connection with the proposal for a Farm InstiLuui at Uek is uoanag oranincion, but it seems probable that the cost of enacting suoh a building, would,
at present prices, be altogether beyond the resources of a single county although it might be possible for a combination of two or more counties. It has accordingly been suggested that a second "Type" plan should be prepared of a Farm Institute built on the "pavilion" principle, capable of accommodating, say, 20 students for a start and of being extended by the erection of additional blocks as occasion arises. The Superintending Architect is having such a plan prepared.

In this connection it seems likely that, for some time to come, the best method for County Councils to adopt will be to  secure an existing building of the "hall" or "Mansion" type, capable of adaptation. Such a course has been suggested to the west Sussex County Council as an alternative to their proposal to construct new buildings on a portion of Kingsham Farm, near Chichester, which they have acquired for a Farm Institute.

The Ministry of Health have been asked to give facilities to the West Sussex County Council to raise loans, in respect of the purchase money (12,640) for the purchase of Kingsham Farm, as under: Land. £11,090 (Period of repayment ? years) Buildings £1,550 (Period of repayment 45 years)

Dairying.

Encouragement of Cheesemaking. Visits of inspection have been made in Hereford, Brecon and Radnor. With regard to Hereford the Board&apos;s Inspector attended the Produce Show held in the Shire Hall, Hereford, and organised by the Agricultural Education Sub-Committee for the County. He reports that there was an excellent display of Dairy Produce, particularly of Small Holders&apos; Cheese which were all of good quality, and generally that the display demonstrated in a forcible manner the excellent work performed by the Dairy Education Staff of the County Committee. The transformation which has taken place in Hereford will be better appreciated when it is remembered that previous to the setting up of the Board&apos;s Scheme in 1915 for the Encouragement of Dairying there was but a comparatively small quantity of milk and practically no cheese produced in the county. The Inspector also visited two of the Milk Depots and Cheesemaking Factories which have been set up in Herefordshire, namely at Dinmore and Ledbury, following Co-operative Cheese Schools. He reports that these depots have developed to a very considerable extent during the summer and are now making considerable extensions in readiness for increased business next season. In addition to carrying on Dairy Work these depots are taking on the general provision of supplies for farmers.

Condensed Milk. The Branch was recently called upon to attend a meeting of the representatives of British Firms concerned with the manufacture of condensed milk. This meeting was held at the Ministry of Food. The manufacturers are alarmed as to their position because (according to them) a large quantity of inferior condensed milk is being imported and this, they claim, is competing unfarily. It was pointed out by the manufacturers that neither consumers nor manufacturers are sufficiently safeguarded by present regulations and they further claim that the absence of adequate regulations will, in the long run, be disadvantageous to producers of milk in that the Home Manufacturers of condensed milk will be unable to carry on owing to unfair competition, and therefore they will no longer be able to buy their raw material from the British farmer. They request that a standard quality should be set up.

Arable Dairy Farming Demonstrations. Owing to the breadkown of negotiations with the Priestman Collieries to purchase land for a site at Wickham, near Blaydon-on-Tyne, further inspections have been made in Durham and Northumberland with the result that two alternative sites have been found, one in each County, and negotiations are proceeding with the respective Small Holdings Committees with a view to the acquisition of one or the other.

By the end of May, in, response tothis letter,   fifteen oountios had formed   new horticulturalSub-Committees.     In   several oases the Local EducationAuthority co-opted the old Horticultural Sub-Committee in   itsentirety.    The attention of the Horticultural Division was thenconcentrated, through their staff of Inspectors, on encouraging;:tho formation   of Horticultural Sub-Commit tees in those countieswhich had not already taiien action, and in expounding the-   Board&apos;views as to the scheme of Horticultural organisation &quot;and education
incalculated to   meet the general needs of the counties., and the specialoonditions obtaining in each county *   Of the 47 iingllsh counties, 38havo no?; set up Horticultural Sub-Committees and nine have not yetdone so.The delay in creating Sub-Committees in these nine countiesis due to a variety of reasons amongst/ which are lack of initiative orthe part of seme responsible County o&amp;Qcial, and apprehend.on that changes in tho Board&quot;&apos;a policy may follow the creation by lew of new-Statutory Committees, and sometimes a lack of sympathy with, and understanding of, the importance of Horticulture.In Wales only four Horticultural Sub-Committees have sr far been appointed.   This is attributable mainly to the fact that, as wasalso found to be the case in England-, it is not until officialwritten recommendations are supplemented by visits aud explanationsthat the Local Authorities are moved to action.   Owing to pressure of work in England, it was not possible until recently to arrangefor visits to Wales; but a Conference hold in Horth $ales inSeptember attended by Professor Bryner Jones, officers of tjheHorticultural Division and the Local Authorities, has given&apos; amarked impetus to the formation of Coramittees.   It is proposed tohold a similar conference in South l/alos.In the majority of Counties in England, and in some counties-II in Wales, tho organisation of a competent staff capable of carryingout the board Horticultural schemes is now making good progress.1 In sixteen counties a Horticultural Superintendent or Organiser haBbeen appointed, with or without an assistant,   In twenty-six countiesithere ia at present only an Instructor, but in several of thesethere is not sufficient scope for Horticultural work to justify the[appointment of a Superintendent.   In seventeen counties neither[Superintendent nor instructor has yet been appointed, but of theseleigho are  J/elsh counties in some of which appointments are expected[very shortly.   In Bedfordshire, Devon, Cornwall? Isle of Ely,[Huntingdon, Kent, Middlesex and Somersethe appointment ofHorticultural Superintendents or Instructors is expected in the nearfuture.The following summary shows the total numbers of[Horticultural Staff appointed in. the counties up to the present:-Horticultural superintendents.................   16Senior Horticultural Instructors..........Horticultural Lecturers        ..... s.........Lecturers or Instructors in poultry KeepingBeetttrttitntttttTtTttttttttttttttttttkeeping3? rui t e no- V e g e t ab lePreservationAllotment and praoti-cal Gardening (..Fruit Culture .....Manual processes ...86 4431515811In addition several counties are employing, and othersje considering the employment of, whole or part-time fruit treepiers, whose wortc should be of educational and commercial value.As regards now appointments, the Board, so far as liestheir power., are insisting on the appointment of men withaeroial experience to posts as Horticultural Superintendents and[tructors, and, as regards the Committees they have urged the option of practical growers and nurserymen, with the result that
adequate representation of all horticultural interests has &quot;been secured on the Committees.Tho Board&quot;s horticultural Scheme makes provision both fora horticultural side to the Farm Institutes, and for Test andDemonstration Plots throughout the country, and there aro indications that these ^reposals have the enthusiast:a support of the Comrjiittees.,sit present, however, only five counties have established FarmInstitutes with a horticultural Section, although definite proposals are being considered by seven other ooantics and general proposals are being favourably diecussed in others-   In some oases the purchase and maintenance of Farm Institutes have been vetoed on grounds of economy-The Board are encouraging- the establishment of Test andDemonstration plots to tost the suitability of varieties to looalconditions, and to demonstrate good methods of cultivation.In --many counties testing&apos; and demonstration plots have been already started, and every effort is being; made by tho Board to secure a reasonable measure oi uniformity in the objective and lay-out ofthe plots in order that tho results, when obtained; may be collatedand conclusions applicable to the county as a whole arrived at *   Tothis end, a memorandum on the work of test in-v and demonstration plotsis being prepared for circulation to the Committees for their use.Thus in spite of the -rcaeral disappointment felt by the horticultural Sub-Committees of tho Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees at their work being- interrupted, the larger part of theground lost by the disbandaent of the horticultural aub-Oomiaittees ofAgricultural Lixecutive Committees has been regained, and a permanentcounty organisation of horticulture is already approaching completion.Jjive dtools, \Number.subsidised    Total New Grants    Hurnber of New Grantsduring year ended    or Renewals since   or Renewals approved-?3I Kerch, 1919.        1st April, 1919. during weefcaBoars                     356                           239 0Bulls                     723                            474 9Heavy horses         122                           141 Nil.Sap or ^ of Stocks   Licences recommended during ^J^e^TeeJ^20 Applications for the Export of f.3 Pedigree Horses wore approved11 n &quot; rf &quot; 32o If on-pedigree Horses were approved.8 &quot; &quot; &quot; 163 Pedigree Cattle          &quot; &quot;1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos;f 50 Hon-flPedigree Cattle   ,T &quot;4 &quot; &apos;T &quot; &quot; 55 pedigree Sheep             &quot; &quot;2 &quot; ,T fr &quot; 200 Non-Pedigree Sheep      &quot; &quot;2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 Pedigree Pigs              n ,fBight Horse Breedings   The Board have issued Regulations under theHorsencoding AcT, Ytlo, and in accordance therewith arrangements will be made by the Board as from 1st November for ths examination ofstallions in respect of which applications for licences are madeoFifty-eight Veterinary Surgeons in private practice have been selected by the Beard to make the prescribed &quot;xaminations:-, and theBoard are in communication with the various Horse breeding Societiesas to the constitution of a panel cf referees,   Under the voluntaryregistration scheme 23-34 stallions were registered last season, but asit will be illegal to travel a stallion next season without a licencethe number of stallions to be examined will be considerably in excessof that of past years *

The Bench convictedhe defendant, but impose4 no fjno as if was the first case in thelistrict, and ordered arrears, amounting to  17,5.0* to be paid.   in the second case, the worker, though described by the Employer as head-&amp;n or bailiff, was o roved &quot;to be employed mainly as a stockmanandhere having been underpayment on this basis, the Beach convicted theefendant, but imposed no fine   The defendant was ordered to payrreare amounting to  3.18.C.

On Oct. 29th, at Uttoxctcr, Stafford, a case was heardagainst a local far-isr for underpayment of one workman employed onhis farm.

But he had notapplied himself, being under the impression that only the workercould legally apply.   Eventually, a pcrmix was apnlied for by him and granted as from tnc 7th Septa   The defendant admitted that the workerhad hern underpaid on the minimum wage basis, hut pleaded that he wasnot worth tint v.&apos;:age-, and that ? pe*soumise.t had bten obtained as soon aspossible, after he realised that the employer. was able to apply.   the bench diemissed the case, an   expressed the opinion that the workerhad been very generously paid.   They made no order as to arrears orcosts.A case in which summonses were issued against an employer inOx^ordshire for underpayment of 14 Workers was heard at Chipping,Morton, on the 151st October.    In tie  case of each of the 4 workerstr-ken first it was proved tnat Hi oh el mas money had. been received.

The contract was still current.   It wafa contend?:d. for;the prosecution that the contractcf service was void under Section 4 (?) of the Corn Production Act,1917, as b;.ing an agreement m contravention cr the section.-   Itwas contended for the defendant that the custom of hieing farm -workersby the year had existed for bundreds of years and that a man so engagedmust give 12 montns serin.ee.

Parcels from Preston, Bel &quot;by and Dunfermline faotoriesreached grade 4 and the average price of the whole of theflaxgraded was about 35/- per stone or  280 per ton.The superiority of Tank retted over Dew retted flax wasvery noticeable.     The prolonged delays in the completion of rettingtanks at several of the factories Is much to be regretted:   were it not for the deficiency of tank accommodation, dew retting operations which, owing to the high price of labour, are very costly, would now be rarely necessary and a much higher average price would berealized lor fibre.
