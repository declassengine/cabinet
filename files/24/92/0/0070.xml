I^^Uliu..........mnimlilll ^-j-j- 11 nUlUMWMIIIIHIAis efli:fe^Jf^TYi&apos;fT9rfVernto by the First Lord of the^tolraltvi&apos;am very anxious that the Cabinet should not mis-ferstand the position of the Admiralty in regard to the un-employment question.The proposal which I have made for the suspension ofdismissals, bearana relation to the general policy of un-employed donation: we have made it solely in order to try andmeet the very natural unrest caused in the Labour werid by thedischarges of a very large number of men, for the great ma.jor-*ity of whom it is very doubtful whether any employment can beff*und during the winter months.     The feeling aroused in the dockyard towns is very great; and already the question is comingvery muoh to the front in the Plymouth election.I am particularly anxious that the Government shouldnot be driven into suspending the discharges as a result of the agitation at Plymouth,    I recommended this course as soon a3 I found that the Minister of Labour was anxious as to unemployment;otherwise the Board of Admiralty would have preferred to adhere to their original programme.   The propooal is, briefly, asfollows :-To suspend all discharges for four months.To bring forward necessary and important work suchas refitting or repairing battleships, and finishing light cruisers, which are very urgently needed.My advisers and I are agreed, after the moot careful consider-ation, that it would be good economy to take this step.&apos; We adopted the original plan in order to meet the greatfinancial pressure, and are prepared to stand by it,   But thework we propose to do, and which would otherwise have been donein May and the following months, will be profitable and- &apos;advantageous to the Navy and the State.I have had the jSstimates revised, and I think the totalextra cost will be  450,000 - not six to seven hundred thousandas I indicated yesterday.I believe it would give great satisfaction in the dock-yard towns; and if the step be taken at once, I can without difficulty make it Clear that it has nothing to do with theelection.    I shall be grateful for a decision to-day.On the general question of unemployed donation, I desire only to say this: the experience I gained in 1901/1902,when the unemployed question was a very serious one throughoutthe country, convinced me then of the great urgency and danger ofthis question.   To-day it has assumed oven more formidableproportions,    I regard the unemployment dole as at presentdistributed, as a great danger to the State. For instance,sailors are a trusting and easily led class; they are told nowby agitators that if they will take their discharge, they will get 29o/- a week, and con do nothing for six months. It is notto be wondered at that after the immense strain of the last five.,years, this is a tempti.ng prospect.   But it was not the intentionof the unemployed donation - and it demonstrates the demger ofthe system, I share, however, the view of the Minister ofEducation, that a close watch should be kept on the labour marketby the Minister of Labour; and that in the event of unemploymentshowing signs of becoming widespread and serious, immediate steps should be taken for its relief.(Intlld) W. H. L.7,11.19,
