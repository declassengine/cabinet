October, 1919.Sir,I an commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the admiralty to forward herewith, for tho consideration of the Committoe ofImperial Defence, a Memorandum which has been prepared by theAdmiralty on the Naval Situation in the Far East.I am, etc    (Sd.) Aiex. Flint,for Secretary.MEMORANDUM BY TEE ADMIRALTY *1.     The Admiralty have been considering tho question of naval basoBin the light of after-war events, and more particularly thosituation with regard to Hong Kong.2,     It would be of great assistance to tho Board if informationoould be afforded as to what will bo tho probable attitude of the government with regard to tho renewal of tho Anglo-japanese alliance in 1981.   It is understood that tho position io breifly as follows.3,     Japanese official attitude will probably be in favour ofrenewal but the British Government may not desire to prolong an alliance which might causo thorn to be embroiled with tho UhitodStates.   If this presumption is corroot tho Treaty is not likelyto be renewed, and in this event the Naval situation in the far east will undergo complete alteration.4. Should a oause of dispute arise with Japan and hostilitiesonsuot it is possible that wo should find ourselves in alliancowith America, but this cannot be counted upon.     Similarly, shouldAmerica..
Amorioa go to war with Japan, it is possible that olthor onCanada or Australia&apos;o account, wo should find ourselves rangedalongside tho United States) but again, thin cannot bo countodupon..5.     Tho Admiralty had also to consider tho question of hootilitioHwith Japan, no other Power assisting.At the 102nd, Meeting of tho Committee of Imperial Defencehold on Juno 89th., 1909, and attended by the thon First Lord,Firnt Sea Lord, Director of Bavol Intelligence and Admiral of theFleet Sir A*K. Wilson, tho following conclusions were arrived ats-&quot;(a) So long as tho Anglo-Japanese alliance remains inforoo, the British Possessions in tho Far East aresecure.(b) Care should be taken sufficiently to reinforce theFleet in tho Far East,, before tho termination oftho alliance in order to neutralise the dangor froma preponderant Japanese Fleet in tho China Soas.(o) The Admiralty and War Office should concert measuresto ensure that the local naval and military defencesat Hong Kong aro on a sufficient scale to enable the fortress to hold out for a period of one month.&quot;6.     It is unlikely, however, in view of the days of economy ahoadof us and the rapidly increasing strength of Japan, vis, anontimatod 9 Dreadnoughts and 8 Battle-C&amp;utsors by 1924, that woshall bo able to maintain a Fleet equal to hero in the Far Eastin peace time.7,     It follows therefore that at the commencement of a war with japan, we should find ourselves in Naval inferiority for a time-,the length of thi3 period depending upon tho amount of warning ofimpending trouble which we are given.   It must always bo romomboredthat groat reluctance is shown by the Government to moving thoFleot during periods of strained relations-, as being likely to precipitate hostilities, and honoo that tho despatch of rein-foraoments may bo delayed until the last moment.8.     Taking the worst situation with our squadrons scattered, andwith certain ships in reserve commission, and bearing in mind thedifficulty of moving a considerable fleet with all its supplyships...
-3-ships and auxiliaries, it in possible that a period of throomonths might relapse before our Naval supremacy in tho Par Eaotoould bo established.     During thio period, Japan would have hadpractically a froo hand at &quot;oca,9.     In those circumstances, it would ho faulty strategy to allowtho naval forcos in Par Eastern Waters to bo looked up at HongKong.   They would he withdrawn, with tho oxcoption of tho localdofonoo Vessels, and based upon the -    probable.port of Assemblyof tho Main Ploet, which may bo assumed to bo Singapore.   Thisport may ho considered sufficiently far from any Japanese pop-sessions to make an attack upon it in force improbable duringtho period available before tho Fleet arrives.Hong Kong would thus be left to its own resources until itcould be relieved, opon to attack by ooa and probably by ltjid.Tho period before relief could bo afforded should not bo assumed to be less than from throo to four months,10.   In these circumstances, the whole nature and extent of thodofonoo scheme for Hong Kong would require revision.11.   The Admiralty bring forward tho question of the defences ofthis particular port now for throo reasons;-(l) Booaueo it is probably the most importantamongst tho bases whose defences will re-quire reconsideration.(2) Because it is understood that the garrison of hong Kong is being largely reduced for reasons of economy. ,(3) Because tho fixod defences of a base cannot behastily improvised and require several years tocomplete, whatever may bo the nature of the defences of the future.12.   The loss of Hong Kong would affect our influence in the Eastpermanently and cannot bo contemplated with equanimity. ,If tho Treaty with Japan is not renewed, and if tho Port is tobo rendered reasonably oooure, thero appears to be no satisfactorymiddle course between tho two alternatives of (i) keeping a,fleet in Eastern Waters - capable of dealing with Japan, or (ii) strengthen the defences of Hong Kong sufficiently to sustain a, prolonged siegeADMIRALTY,31st.
