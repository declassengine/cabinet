Yd(THIS DOCUMENT IS Tig BRQP3RTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVJIMMLJW       5 5 C, R E T,C, P. 27.CAEINET,HOURS OF E!rPLOY!&quot;:iT BILL,,Kcnorandun &quot;by the Secretary for Scotland.The Board of Agriculture for Scotland are ihfavour of including Agriculture in tho Hours of Employ-mcnt Pill.     I am profoundly impressed with the groundsupon which thry urge that view,, and I deeire to lay&quot;before the Cabinet the arguments in support of.it.G^,N3RAL, tho aspiration of the farm, and garden worker to share the benefits of statutory regulations of hours ofemployment extended by tho Bill to other workers is reasonable.,     His exclusion is not a matter of principle,but is duo to th-- belief that regulation of hours ofagricultural labour by statute is inexpedient or. impracticable.,She benefit to the worker of statutoryholidays which would allo,,r him,, for the first time, tobuild 9P a social and recreative life in the country during&apos;daylight need not be laboured.     The benefit tothe Nation of a contented and settled rural population is admitted.   The loss of production, if any, due toregulation of hours need not be discussed, as it applies to the other industries which are included in the Bill.EXPS3 JSN.CY: In -January last the German Government issued anew code to regulate labour conditions on the land, to check the exodus from the. rural districts, and to attracturban wage workers to agriculture.   The daily hours oflabour are fixed for each third, of the year and overtimeis to be paid for at special rates.     In Italy an eighthour day for Agriculture has been adopted.It is expedient in Gr^at Britain to regulate thehours in-order to prevent -farm labour from falling tothe lowest -stratum of manual workers from which otherindustries are recruited and by v&apos;hich general wages are thus depressed.     .It is expedient also to give, the farmlabourer self respect and self confidence and to make him in time.-a better producer by making him feel that hisindustry is equal in national importance -to cottonspinning or engineering.     It .is expedient in order-toavoid friction between employer and employed.     Finally,it is expedient to include the -industry in the Bill now,because ultimate inclusion is inevitable and its post-ponrment will be bitterly resented.   The resentment willtake the form of the hostile votes.of the farm labourerand his wif o at the next e 1 e-ct ion.
RACTICABILITY,.....1 &quot; v...............*&quot;&quot;&apos;If the inclusion r.f agrj cultural labour is just andexpedient, its exclusion can only he defended on the groundthat it is impracticable to give Agriculture the same treat-ment as other industries&apos;,   It is said by the employer to be impracticable beoause it may mean to him shorter hours,less production, and leas profit.   As Agriculture is a seasonal occupation, dependent m ths weather during partcf the year, it is said that the labourer must be ready towork such number cf hours as weather may dictate, and tobe idle if weather conditions are unfavourable.   In practice this is not r*,o. The farmer dues not send his men h:.me tvrest when the&apos;w3ather prevents outdi..&apos;r work.   The ploughmandoes not get a half-holiday on Saturday beoause the groundis too hard to plough or the roads too icy for carting.   In&apos;  practice the difficulties of season and weather are notinsuperable, as is proved by the fact that in several ScottishCounties definite agreements have already been reached between the fs&amp;in servant and the employer regulating thenumber of hours to be worked in each season of the year andthe circumstances under which overtime is to be demandedfrom the worker along with the rate of overtime pay.   At aConference in Perth in February the National Farmers1 union and the Farm Servants&apos; Union agreed to recommend an average50 hour week, and this recommendation was adopted by manyCounty Committees.   The question in point of fact is notcne of practicability but of number of hours and overtimewages4RTTCQHOCTDATIOH.I suggest that a clause or clauses should be added tothe Bill to include persons employed in Agriculture not onthe basis of a 48 hour week but on the basis that the totalnumber of hours worked per annum be 2496 hours which i3equivalent to an average 48 hour week.   The year&apos;s hoursbeing fixed, it should be left to the District WagesCommittees to adjust the distribution of those hours inaccordance with local knowledge and customs.   The followingagreement made and adhered to by employers and employedin Mid and East Lothian illustrates the possibility of arriving at an-arrangement on these lines&quot;5o hours for 38 weeks&quot;60 hours for 6 weeks&quot;44-^ hours for 8 weeks&quot;Overtime compulsory at seed time and harvest.   payment for overtime l/3 per hour for men, for others time and a half&quot; .Cattlemen,  shepherds and dairy workers, who cannotbe included in any definite &quot;hour week&quot;, can like otherclashes of farm labourers, get the benefit of a fixed&quot;hour yearl; and can by local arrangement be compensates forlong days cr weeks and Sunday labour by a correspondingholiday of consecutive days on full pay, equivalent to the extra hours worked.&quot;ROBERT TOTRO&quot;.Scottish pffice^31 si October, 1919,
