CABINET.(lOMMUNICAtflON BETWEEN THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND HIS majesty&apos;s government.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.Tho scheme for regulating.correspondence between the League ofNations find. His Majesty&apos; s Government, propounded by Sir MauriceH-nkcy in War Cabinet Paper G.T.8369 of the 17th October, is cvident-ly of very considerable importance and closely affects the ForeignOffice.My advisors there are unanimously of opinion that Sir Mauriceflankoy&apos;8 scheme is both generally and from the particular point ofview of the Foreign Office open to grave objections.    It is,clearthat the League of Nations will be constantly handling questionsvitally affecting the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government withforeign States, and foreign affairs must Inevitably play a very con-slderable part in all business of the League of  Nations.    For thisreason it is considered that tho Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and tho Foreign Office should have a preponderant voice inall questions relating to correspondence between the League and his majesty&apos;s Government *It is considered of tho greatest importance that the league should not be permitted to correspond direct with individual Depart-merits of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentk, and that they should not havethe right to address communications direct.to the Cabinet through its Secretariat* but only through the Foreign Office, so as toensure that the Secretary of State should be kept Informed.    It istherefore held to be essential that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be the sole means of communication between the Secre-tariat of the League of  Nations and His Majestyfs government   ItIs not thought that this proposal would give rise to any difficulties.It will no doubt be necessary for some special department to be sc*up in the foreign Office to doal specifically with communicationsreceived from the League of  Nations^ and if this proposal is agreedto extra staff will undoubtedly be required; but it may be notedthat if Sir Maurice Henkey*s scheme is adopted in preference extraataff will also bo required for the Cabinet Secretariat.As almost every question, however trifling in appearance, whichis dealt with by the League of Nations will be of real and almostparamount importance to the Foreign Office, it is felt that it ?*ouldbo simpler and more efficacious that the Foreign Office should bethe regular channel of correspondence between the Secretariat of theLeague and His Majesty&apos;s Government.      The Foreign Office are readyto undertake thi.3 task if the       Cabinet concur, and will present for their consideration a scheme for carrying on the resulting work.(Xntd)   C. of K.Foreign Office, November 1, 1919.
