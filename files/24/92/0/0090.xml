fen&apos;]RETgriyn to cabinet.OPINION IM THE UNITED STATES OH THE IRISH QUESTION-Copy of letter from VjLscoUrit Grey to tho Prime Ministerv(See also G T- 65or&quot; )British EmbassyjWashington,17th October,My clear Lloyd George,1919I may supplement what I said lost week on the Irish question by saying that oil the conversations I have had with people heresince I last wrote to you encouraged me in thinking that a realamelioration of American feeling may result, from a policy ofself-government for Ireland on good lines.I continue to take the line that Unionists have given upUnionism, and Home Rulers have come to recognize that tho Protes-tant area of Ulster must have separate treatment; and that a freshstart is to bo oxpectedoSome of the feeling in America arises from the belief thatthe Irish policy of tho Government is directed by Careen-,      Animportant member of the Administration told me the other day what this point of view was.     They regard it as unfair that Carsonshould have been allowed to import Arms into Ulster from Germany,Arms which were to be used against the policy of the BritishGovernment. - They regard it as very unfair that these Arms shouldnot be seized or molested; while Arms collected by Nationalistsare seized at Corko      They also point to the fact that Carsonhas twice been taken into the Cabinet and that the other day the first announcement in the American papers that the cabinet was considering a now Irish policy contained the statement, thatCarson had been called into consultation with the Cabincio    Ipoint out, of course, that Redmond would have been in Campbell-Banner-man&apos;s Cabinet in 19C5 and again in the first coalition government during tho war,but refused; and I do not write this to you by way of criticism but solely to give you tho Americanpoint of view.   The first thing with th j-se people as with other people is to understand their point of view0I am writing a letter to Curzon to explain their point ofview about tho Persian Agreement; which I am asking him to showypus     I hope you will find time to road it and also my lasttw,,o telegrams to him about Persia.Yours sincerely, &apos;(sgd) Grey of F,
