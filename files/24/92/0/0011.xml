Such an organisation was justifiable in the circumstances of the present war when the forces raised were mainly composed of men drawnvoluntarily or compulsorily from civilian life, and theprovisions of tho Pensions Warrant, including not only a specialscale of flat rate Disability Pension; but the alternative pension and Medical Treatment and Training, were designedexpressly to meet the claims of this class.   The same considerations led to tho creation of the local organisation ofLocal iftfar Pensions Committees throughout the kingdom, and ofRegions and Regional Offices to enable the Ministry of pensions to cope rapidly with the large number of cases of disablement.These considerations will not, however, apply to the regular forces of the future, which will not presumably produce casesof injury or disablement in any greater number than In normalpre-war times *I propose, therefore, that Disability Pensions fordisablement sustained after the present war should be administered by the Service Departments instead of by the Ministry ofPensions.   In support of this course, I would point out thatt(a) the Service Departments already assess theService Pension and, without additional staff or cost,can equally well assess the Disability Pension atthe same time, as, In fact, they did before the war;(b) it will remove the danger of constant pressure from the fighting services on the Ministryof Pensions to increase the rates of DisablementPensions, and on the Service Itepartmonts to increasethe rates of Service Pension, which has led to theawkward position referred to In    my memorandumof today s date relating to Service and disability pensions.Warrants dealing with Disablement Pensions andRetired Pay for post-war service are now under consideration, andit should clearly be a principle of these Warrants that compensation for disability should take account of the service pension so that, in effect, the State nay be assured that a manis not receiving in the aggregate more than reasonable compen-sat ion both for discharge from the Service on the ground ofdisability, and for the disability Itself.In the interests of sound administration as well as ofpublic economy, I ask for the decision of the Cabinet(1)   that the Ministry of Pensions shall be recognised as concerned with Pensions for the present war only,a Bill to be promoted at a convenient opportunity toamend the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1916, and(?)
(2)   that the new scheme of disability pensions and Retired Pay for post-war conditions should be prepared by the Service Departments onthe principle that Service end Disability Pensionsaro merged and administered by those Departments.If these proposals are accepted, it will be possibleto bring about a gradual reduction in the very costly localorganisation of Local He.r Pension ilOiiuuttees and Regionalstaff which have been rendered aeuessary by the specialcircumstances of the present war.
