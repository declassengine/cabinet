The mild season is enabling farmers to economise theirstores of fodder, milch cows and other stock being still out onpasture, which in many places is affording almost as much food as during the dry summer months.The week&apos;s reports regarding potato yields indicate that tthe crop is turning out better than was expected, and is being storedin splendid condition.
