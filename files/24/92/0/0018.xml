St-r-ind, &apos;&apos;T.C8.29th&apos;October, 1919,MEMORANDUM BY THE AIR S.TAEE CN THE RETENTION 05! CYPRUS.Various proposals for and against the retention of     , ;Cyprus have been put forward&apos; to the T7ar; Cabinet by the       * ,Admiralty and have been considered by the Air Staff. -* ,The following Memorandum was forwarded by theChief of the Air Staff to the&apos;-7ar Off ice,&apos; date d 2nd May, 1919:-&quot;Cyprus undoubtedly has many advantages as an airbase for dominating the Eastern Mediterranean, andit may form&apos; a convenientjand perhaps essential,stopping place on the route from Egypt to India.On the other hand, these advantages will cease tobecome essential, provided that we obtain one or more suitable bases in Palestine, reasonably capable- of defence and maintenance in war time.If, on the other hand, we do not obtain defensiblebases suitable for aircraft work in Palestine, orus far North as Haifa or even Eeyrout, then it isconsidered necessary that Cyprus should be retained&quot;.Since that date the situation at the Eastern endof the Mediterranean has developed to our disadvantage and we now have the principal harbours tmd bases under the control ofFrance and Italy, with no defended bases suitable for aircraftwork in Palestine.Paragraph (S) of Admiralty Memorandum to ^ar Cabinet.8262.     of 3rd October, 1919,T really sums up our point of view. Tiecannot afford to run the risk of Cyprus being used by anotherPower established In Asia Minor or Palestine, as an advancebase for air attacks on Egypt and the Suez Canal.Our
Our main base at this end of the Mediterraneanwill be at Alexandria, and if we can prevent any other power from using Cyprus, there should be no difficulty inpatrolling the approaches to the Canal.     It may be necessaryfor us to establish a base for re-fuelling in Cyprus.from to sum up/an Air Force point of view(l)   It is not proposed to establish apermanent Naval base at Cyprus under the present conditions, but this may require reconsideration if in the futureit is found necessary to develop the island to a British Haval fortress, whenthe question will have to be re-considered..(2)   It is of vital importance that no othergreat Power should be allowed! to obtaincontrol of Cyprus and it is therefore in-. advisable that tho island should be cededto Greece.41 r Ministry.,,.
