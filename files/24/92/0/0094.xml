His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to have yourconsidered opinion as to what is likely to happen when we finally evacuate Batum.While they are willing to delay our withdrawal for the time being, they are notprepared to keep troops there indefinitely. - You should therefore endeavour to estimate the period for which it will be necessary for us to remain. You should also advise asto what in your opinion should be the ultimate political future of the port and province,e.g., whether it should become an international free port or become part of Georgia orof Russia.ILReply from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Army of the black Sea, to the Secretary, War Office.General Headquarters,Constantinople,Sir, 4th October, 1919.With reference to your telegram No. 81303, cipher, D.M.O., 20th September, Ihave the honour to forward the following report on the future of the town and province of Batum : 1. The questions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government wish information are asfollows: (a.) What is likely to happen when we finally evacuate Batum ?lb.) An estimate of the period for which it will be necessary for us to remain.(c.) What should be the ultimate political future of the province ?2. In discussing these three questions, it must be noted that the result arrived atfor (c) will strongly influence the decision for (b).3. The main factor governing the whole discussion is : What is to be the politicalfuture of the Trans-Caucasian States ?   Once this is settled, the rest is simple.4. His Majestys Government has already expressed itself as favourably disposed to the independent existence of the States of Georgia and Armenia, and has laid down a line as the southern limit of Russian influence. &apos; This situation has never been admitted by General Denikin who claims these States as part of Greater Russia.Unless some strong mandatory power is prepared to father the Trans-CaucasianRepublics for the next two generations, they will, assuredly, be engulfed in a GreaterRussia either by force, or more probably, to seek protection of their own free will.(B19/509)   95  11/19  H&amp;8  7660vo01498165
(a.) What is likely to happen when we Evacuate Batum?5. Batum Province, as regards population, may be divided by a line running eastand west from a point 15 miles south-east of the port. To the south of this line thepopulation is Mussulman, either Turkish or pro-Turk ; to the north it is largelycomposed of Georgian Mussulmans, with tendencies half Georgian, half Turkish. Thisstrong pro-Turkish sentiment has a strong bearing on the first question. The experienceof the last 9 months shows that the Georgians claim Batum province and port; in fact,they openly advocate their claims, and at the moment have troops ready on the frontier to act on our withdrawal. That the Turks should he allowed to occupy the province is out of the question, and I do not consider that they will make any attempt to do so,having regard to the present policy of the National Defence League, out it would appearthat they will limit their action to stirring up trouble against the Christian Georgiansand thus making their task more difficult. Under such a government a very high degree of law and order will not be attained, more especially as the town of Batumcontains a large proportion of Russian population actively hostile to Georgia.6. Denikin undoubtedly intends to despatch a naval expedition to occupy Batumin the event of our withdrawal. He regards it as purely Russian. Such action couldbe stopped only by the Great Powers. Operations from the sea, or an advance by landvid Gagri, would involve him in war with both Georgia and Azerbaijan. It is difficultto realize that he would be so foolish, but Russian pride is unaccountable, and to do so would be on a par with his present action at Gagri and in Daghestan, which point tohis ultimate intention to re-occupy Trans-Caucasia.7. The situation on our departure from Batum will be probably that it will come under a corrupt and incapable Georgian Government, who will thus control the exits ofRussian Armenia, and the Province of Baku to the Black Sea, but whose position willbe rendered difficult by Mussulman intrigue and Russian hostility. The clock ofcivilization will have gone a step backwards,(b.) For what period are British Troops to remain?8. The period British troops are to remain depends on the solution to (c). Ifthe port is to become Georgian, it could be handed over on ratification of the treaty with turkey, provided that Denikin&apos;s action could be restrained. If the possibility of its being returned to Russia is to be considered, then it would appear advisable to continuethe occupation until the establishment of a Greater Russia, or the institution of somestable form of government in Southern Russia.9. If it be clearly established that the port and province are to be free under a governor of one of the Great Powers, then I am in favour of an easy and gradualreplacement of the troops by trained gendarmerie under the Mandatory Power which is responsible for the Trans-Caucasian States.(c.) The Ultimate Political Future of Batum.10. As Batum is the main outlet of the Caucasian States to the west, it isobvious that it should not be placed in the hands of Russia if the economic life of the trans-Caucasian States under their existing political conditions of independence is to be encouraged. It would not be in her interests to allow trade to circulate through Batumto the advantage of these States, whose trade she would certainly desire to throttle inorder to bring economic pressure to bear to force them to forfeit their independence,which she at present tolerates only owing to lack of force to compel them to join her.Unless Russia occupies Batum for some such purpose it can be of little value to her,with a hostile Georgia rendering any form of co-operation in the working of the railwaysand pipeline impossible and probably diverting both to her own port of Poti. Theoccupation of Batum by Russia can be only a means to an end the occupation of thewhole of Trans-Caucasia and is therefore a question of higher policy. Its occupationat the present will mean a conflagration in the Caucasus. If the Republics decide tofederate with Russia then Batum would become a federated port.11. Georgia is the only one of the Trans-Caucasian States capable of assumingcontrol of the port and town. Its presence would be welcomed by some of thepopulation, railway control would be simplified and the tariff on the Baturm-Georgianfrontier would be abolished.12. The objections are that such a policv would be objected to most strongly by russia; that so far Georgia has shown no great capacity for using her power wiselyand might be inclined to throttle her sister Republics ; that so far as the port and town
are concerned the step would be a retrograde one ; and lastly and most important, thatthe sole exit from Russian Armenia to the sea would be closed by Georgia, who alreadycommands the railway line and whose position in Trans-Caucasia would thereforebecome supreme.13. The last I regard as the strongest point why Batum should not becomeGeorgian, though were it possible to arrange for guarantees being given of equaleconomic rights for the trade of the other Trans-Caucasian States, the cession of Batumto Georgia is the next best alternative to the following proposition : 14. The political future of the port and province which would result in thegreatest advantage to the Trans-Caucasian States and to the world at large would bethe institution of an International Free Port and Province under a European Governor.Georgia would probably be only too glad to find a way of escape from a difficult situation, Armenia would be benefited, a focus of law and order would be instituted inthe Caucasus and Russia would have no real cause for complaint. Trade would be encouraged, the oil industry could be controlled and a share taken in the supervision ofthe railways, while a separate line of communication could be opened into Armenia.A check could also be instituted on German influence, now again developing in Georgiaand at Baku.15. As Georgia would be friendly, it is unlikely that she would inaugurate anotheroil pipe line to Poti, and the occupation should become a sound commercial propositionhy the development of the port and province.1 6. Under an able and just administration troops could be dispensed with as soonas a trained gendarmerie was ready to take their place, in which case the occupationshould become self-supporting. At the end of five years, by which time it should bepossible to visualize the future of Trans-Caucasia, the situation can be reconsidered.This is, in my opinion, not only the most humanitarian but commercially the soundestpolicy and one of which the seeds are already sown. It can continue to be workedupon without waiting for any Peace Conference decision, and would probably he themost agreeable to all concerned. The results obtained by our Military Governors inTrans-Caucasia show what can be achieved at comparatively little expense.17. I have not touched on the possibility of a Turkish or of an Armenianoccupation. The former is out of the question; as regards the latter, the Armenianpopulation in Batum is negligible.   There Turks, Georgians or Russians predominate.I have the honour to be,Sir,   -Your ,obedient Servant,G. F. MILNE, General,Commanding-in-Chief, Army of the Black Sea.
