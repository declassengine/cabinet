495SECRET,........^        Pc. r, 98. ).    &apos;i&apos;.............m.mmmTHE SUPPLY.....CP,,WHISKEY..Memorandum by tho Chancellor of tho Exchequer.On receipt of the Pood Controller&apos;8 Memorandum.(G.T. 8411) on the subject of the supply of whiskey, I circulated the following memorandum to the Pood Controller,the Home Secretary, the President of the Board of Education,Lord D&apos;Abcrnon and the Board of Customs and Excise :-Proposals for modifying the restriotions on thesupply of whisky are already before the Government.The case for some modification involving some increasein the quantities allowed to be sold has been put by the PoodController and is in my opinion overwhelming.     But beforethe Cabinet is called upon for a decision, I should be obliged if you would favour me with your opinion on thefollowing points.1,   Is it possible under a scheme of rationing basedon 19l6 clearances to supply fairly the wants ofthe population as redistributed in 1920 or 1921?2.    If the restrictions were totally removed wouldthere be under present circumstances any largoincrease of clearances?   Do not the conditions of stocks and the provision of the law requiring 3years bonding make any great increase   impossible?3*   Even if there were a sensible increase, would anyharm be done?   It must be remembered that the alcoholicstrength of whisky has been reduced.   If we consumedthe same bulk gallons of whisky, we should still beconsuming less alsofrol.I raise these questions for two reasons.First: because if natural causes would exe:icse asufficient cheat on clearances, the Gpvern-ment by interfering incurs odium withoutany public advantage.Seccndly:    beoause Lam advised that as long as. Government restrictions on quantitiesprevail in any form however restricted,the licence holder is entitled by statuteto the special reduction of licence, dutyaccorded to him under the full war-timereduction of both beer and spirit traffic.The restriction now continued on whisky alone thusoperates to relieve licence holders of a charge of .2 or 3millions a yoar which they can well afford to pay.   (TheBoard of Customs in their reply will please give tho exactfigure).The following is a brief summary of the replieswhich I have received to my enquiry(l)     In answer to the question whether a eahemc of rationing based on 1916 clearances is equitable, Mr. Fisher
States that he is doubtful whothor a scheme of rationing onsu*h a basis does adequate justice to all the.claimsinvolved.   On theoretical grounds he would prefer that the vendor should bo given a choice between the three basicyears,- 1914, 1915 and 19li, but suggests that practicalAiffioulties of administration might prevent such a course,The Pood Controller is in favour of revoking the*&amp;2ft iniftg part of the Intoxicating Liquor [Output and delivery) Order and of treating spirits in the same way as wines and beer.The Board of Customs and Excise report that in theiropinion the 19l6 basis is no longer equitable for thefollowing reasons(a) The total consumption of spirits in 1916 was V$ peroent* below the average of the four previous years,(b) The population of the country is now reverting to thepre-war iistribution, whioh was very much altered duringthe War, chiefly o^ing to the large migrations tomunition areas.   As an instance of the inequitablenessof the 19l6 standard, the case cf new clubs is quoted,and of clubs whose membershii; has been largely augmentedby the teturn of men from the War.   At the same time theBoard of Customs and Excise point out that any distribu-tion Oti a population basis only would not be equitable,aft the habits of the working classes in different areas,as regards consumption of intoxicants, vary very widely.On this point the Homo Secretary and Lord P1Abornonhav&quot; not sufficient information to enable them to express an opinion.(2)     As regards my sejond enquiry, the ^ood Controller statesthat in his opinion the removal of restrictions would probably not result in any substantial increase in clearances owing to :-(i)     the desire of holders to conserve their stocks:(iij     the rapid absorption of stocks by large combinations:(iii)     the operation of the Immature Spirits Act.The Homo Secretary expresses the view that there woul*lbe no large immediate increase of spirits on the market if thepresent embargo were lifted, but that there would be a con-siderable and growing increase with the change wrought by thelowering of the Excess Profits Tax and the consequent greaterwillingness of the hcldcrB to realise stocks.The Board of Customs and Excise state that the removalof ---stricticn3 would probably result in only a small increaseof Aftliveriea from bond.   Tho additional quantities releasedwo\ld consist mainly of inferior classes of imported spiritsand possibly of gin, which is not subjeot to the age limit., hose spirits would be sold /
for the most part in the common bars of public houses..There ,:,ould probably be no increase in tfee retail market in better class whiskies which form a great bulk of thetrade.(3)   In answer to my third enquiry, the Pood Con-troller states that the abandonment of the present scheme&apos;&quot;Ould temporarily dislocate distribution, and probablycause hardship In the case of some of the smaller publicans.In this connection, he thinks that some good might result if the strength of whisky ,,rere raised from 300 underproofto 250.   This might check the growing practice of orderingdouble whiskies.The Home Secretary Is of the opinion that anincrease in the supply of spirits Is to be feared anddeprecated, his view being that even if a small totalof alcohol is consumed, the hard drinker will consumemore than at present.Lord D!Abernon, v&apos;hile finding it difficult togive a short and clear answer* on a question of such importance, states that he personally is against quantitycontrol, provided ether safeguards are established.The Board of Customs and Excise state that as any increase in consumption would occur chiefly In inferiorpublic house spirits, some increase of drunkenness might result.   This tendency v&apos;fould, however, be counteractedby :-(a) the leer strength at which spirits may besupplied](b) restricted hours;(c) high prices;and in their opinion; these factors diminish drunkennessmore than any restriction on deliveries?(4) As regards the general questions of policyraised in the last part of my memorandum3 Mr. Fisherstates that he is against the removal of all control,because the relaxation of all control as regardsquantity would render it difficult for the Food controller to administer any fair system of apportionment, but he isin favour of Mr. Roberts1 proposal to release an additional5 per cent.   while he recognises that the abolition ofall restrictions would redound to the advantage cf theTreasury, he suggests that ihhis advantage might equally besecured by an alteration in the Finance Act next year,and he feels that in any case this advantage would notin itself be sufficient to justify the removal of allcontrol.Lord D!Abemon agrees that licence holders couldwell afford to pay the full duty, and that there is no justification for granting the war time reduction whichcauses loss to the Exchequer.   At the same time, he holdsthe view that to remove all control for the sake of this additional revenue would be to settle a very large issueon a minor point.
The Borne Secretary hold j, that the preje. .t remi,4o:.of the licence duty ought not to be continued, and thatthere ;U a very ctrong argument for removing the limitatio..oi: jpirit^, presuming that good legal opinion ha.3 been takenfto to the reduction of licence duty.    The relief r.ov/afforded to Xioei.ce holders 1j   stated by tho Board ofChutom* and Exoiao to amount to  3,792,000 for the year1918-19.Mr.Boberta state.; that he would be prepared toadopt a more thorough policy if it would help theExchequer, but that the additional 5^ would, in hi.opinion ensure the floo of a reasonable. &amp;uui:tity of spirit,for 12 months.The Bourd of Cu^tom-j ai.&amp; Excise favour the ubolitionof re^trictioiu on the amour, ta cleared, provided that control of prices and reduction of strength are stillmaintuined,,   (Intlld) A.C.Treasury, S.W.ICth November, 1919,
