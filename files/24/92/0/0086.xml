[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s frovernmeaj]Printed fpr the Cabinet. November 1919.SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL.IMPORTATION OF CANADIAN STORE CATTLE.Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I STRONGLY oppose the recommendation of the President of the Board ofTrade (Cabinet Paper No. C.P.-4) to admit Canadian store cattle to the UnitedKingdom.I do so because I am advised that it would: (1.5 Expose the live stock of the United Kingdom to the danger of disease;(2.) Decrease the supply of home-fed meat;(3.) Expose the State to danger by relying on seaborne instead of home-reared stores.1. Before the passing of the Diseases of Animals Act of 1896 the number of stock shipped to Great Britain from Ireland was low and the quality was inferior.Since then a great improvement has been effected in the quality of Irish cattle, animprovement which is generally acknowledged by all.Tempted by the security against disease, Irish breeders have taken up thebreedingof high class sires now to be found in all parts of the country. At the recent Shorthorncattle sales in Scotland a number of small Irish farmers expended over 20,000/. on thepurchase of pure-bred stock for the further improvement of the Irish cattle industry.It is due&apos;to the enterprise of such men, fostered by the schemes (partly rate aided) ofthe Department of Agriculture, that the Irish store cattle fatten rapidly, and yield ahigh proportion of meat for the food consumed. If the security from disease is removed by the importation of Canadian stores the confidence and enterprise ofbreeders will be destroyed, and a great asset in food production will be lost.The devastation caused by pleuro pneumonia introduced by cattle from abroad,and only eradicated after enormous expense extending over a long period of years,is still remembered and its repetition dreaded.Since 1883 Irish herds have been free from foot and mouth disease, with theexception of one outbreak in 1912 which paralysed the cattle industry, cost thecountry a large sum of money, and required three years for its eradication.2. Great Britain has in large measure become dependent upon Ireland for storecattle while Ireland relies upon Great Britain to buy and fatten them ah arrange-ment which is to the mutual advantage of both Islands. Two out of every five cattleslaughtered in Great Britain are born in Ireland. Ireland, with its 320,000 smallholdings and its mild winters, is the fitting place for breeding and rearing storecattle, while Great Britain, with a drier climate, is more suited to cropping andtherefore to &quot;finishing&quot; bullocks.During the war period Ireland sent to Great Britain 4,378,707 cattle, besidesmeeting her own needs.The increase in the shipment of Irish cattle described as &quot; fat,&quot; and thecorresponding decrease i&apos;n cattle described as &quot; store&apos;&apos; has been misunderstood andexaggerated. The increase in &quot; fat &quot; cattle was due to a new basis of classification.It paid farmers to send half fat animals for immediate slaughter. Great Britain,owing to a shorter supply, was prepared to take lean meat, since her farmers hadinsufficient feeding stuffs to fatten Irish beasts. It is obvious that with the scarcity of feeding stuffs Irish animals shipped to Great Britain on the average were actuallyleaner than before the war. This fact, viz., that the increase in the Irish exportof fat cattle was not real, has been referred to time after time in Irish publications.Ireland still is, and will always be, in a position to supply stores to Great Britain,provided the small holder is encouraged to expend money on the purchase of highclass pure-bred sires. The use of such, by increasing the fattening propensities of irish stores, will insure, more than anything else, an increase in home-fed meat.
3. The Prime Minister has rightly said that if in the future this country shouldhave an enemy we must not put in his way the temptation that he can starve us. Totake away the security against disease which our farmers now enjoy, to destroy the enterprise of breeders of animals from investing their capital in pure-bred stockwould undoubtedly have the effect of driving farmers out of the breeding and rearingof store cattle, leaving Great Britain dependent upon supplies of overseas stores,thus creating, as regards meat, one of the very conditions which the PrimeMinister declared we must not create in the future.If ft should be argued that the number of store cattle likely to come from canada will be small and therefore will not interfere with the home producer, theresponsibility of destroying the present development in home breeding and homefeeding by opening the ports to Canadian cattle is the less justified. Further, thereare 2,500,000 store cattle raised in the United Kingdom. Is the health of so manyto be risked, for a few Canadian stores ?Again, if it be argued that the admission of Canadian stores will not diminish the demand for home-reared animals, it follows that to feed the additional Canadian!cattle in this country there must be a call on shipping to import an additional amountof feeding stuffs of which there already is, and for some time to come there is likelyto be, an insufficient supply for the existing live stock.I. M.November 8,1919.
