(This Document is the Property of   c/6His Brita.;j ;;;-;v&apos;-i GiwiYiment.)/^SERVICE AND PI SAB I u IT Y PENSIONSfor90INVALIDED OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE ARKY, NAVY AMD AIR FORCE.I submit trie following for the decision of . the Cabinet.(Sd) L.Worthington Evans28th October, 1919.The rates of Service Pension for regular officers andmen of the fighting forces have recently been very substantially increased, without, I fear, full consideration being given to thefinancial effect in those cases in which Pension both for disablo-ment and for service are, under present Regulations,payable con-currently. The increase of Service Pensions, which amounts to asmuch as 200 per cent on the basic rate in the case of the non-.commissioned ranks, was, In part, admittedly designed to meet theincreased cost of living, and in the case of officers will besubjeot as to 20 per cent of the increase, to reconsideration in five years time If the cost of living shews a sufficient reduction.Disability Pensions administered by the Ministry of Pensionshave, however, been similarly raised during the war to meet theIncreased cost of living, and on the irecent recommendations of theSelect Committee on Pensions, a further 20 per cent Increase inthe case of pensions for non-commissioned ranks has been grantedwhich will be subject to review in three years time.The principle of Pension Regulations before the present war and during Its first two years was that Disability and service pensions were not given concurrently.   This principle has,however,been modified in the past three years so far as to allow ofService Pension being drawn in addition to a minimum DisabilityPension, which excluded the elements of rank and service.   TheService Pensions thus drawn concurrently with Disability Pensionswere, however, based on pre-war rates.It is hardly reasonable that, in the case of officers or men entitled to both Service and Disability Pensions concurrent-ly, the State should bo called upon to pay increased rates for both classes of pension simultaneously to meet the higher cost ofliving.MEN. It is suggested,&apos; therefore, that in cases where men ofthe Regular Forces are entitled to Service Pensions at theincreased rates, Disability Pensions for the present war shouldbe awarded on the scale at present in forco, namely 33/- a week for total disablement instead of 40/-, as sanctioned for men whoenlisted for the duration of the war only.It is estimated that this will Involve a saving of 300,000 a year.OFFICERS. In the case of officers the award of disability pensionsis more difficult, because the Service Departments have notfollowed uniform linesi   the Admiralty, unlike the Army Council,having obtained sanction to a substantially increased scale of ser-vice pensions (distinct from half-pay) expressly payable onaccount of disability, though calculated on the basis of service.The
Tho Service Pension scale (including half-pay) has always been more generous for officers than for men andconsequently disabled (regular) officers entitled to service pension were specially provided for by the ilnistry ofPensions by a quite arbitrary pension (maximum  100) by wayof addition to their service pension, unless tUodisablement pension for temporary officers (maximum,  175for a Liioutenant) happened to &quot;be more favourable.&apos;  The&apos;disability pension, or addition to pension has recently been increased by a bonus of 20 per&apos; cent to meet tho increased cost of living.The Select Committee on Pensions has not yet made any proposals as regards Officers1 Pensions and at present thei inistry have only authority in cases of disablement togrant addition (with bonus) to Service Pensions or half-pay, -on tho basis of the 1914 rates of Service Pension aI should propose, therefore, as an interim measurethat, in the case of disabled officers entitled to service pension, a disability addition&apos; to such pension should beallowed on the scle authorised by the Pensions Warrants,viz.,  100 as a maximum, without the addition of the bonusof 20 per cant recently sanctioned by the Cabinet, providedthat in no case shall an officer got less than ho wouldhave under present conditions.&apos;
