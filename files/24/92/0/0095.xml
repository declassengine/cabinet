This Doci rr-t n Property ofHis Britarm ; r .   ;.,    government&apos;3PI&amp;SSNT POSITION OP HOUSING.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.I circulated -a Cabinet paper (C.Pa3) on October27th giving statistical details of the present position,indicating remedies proposed, attaching a draft Bill for thispurpose, and dealing incidentally with the Memoranda recentlycirculated by other Ministers.I will not refer again in detail to the statisticsbut will deal further as requested by the Prime Minister with the causes of delay and my proposals for remedying them.n        I. ri, cost. i^xa^L^o c/fForemost amongst causes of delay must be placed the appalling cost which we are finding everywhere.     It iscontinually making authorities to hesitate, and brings intogreater prominence the necessity for pushing the new and cheapertypes of houses to which I shall refer later.2&apos; DIFFICULTIES IN RAISING LOANS.Another,cause of delay which neither authoritiesnor the Ministry can control is the great difficulty which many are certainly experiencing in raising the necessary loans.Under the present arrangement authorities below  200,000rateable value can obtain their money through the PublicY/orks Loan Commissioners.     Others are required to raise themoney for themselves.    Experience has now shown that It is absolutely certain that a great number of very willingauthorities above the  200,000 limit are net able to finance the schemes themselves.3&apos; UNCERTAINTY AS TO RENTS.&apos; Another commonly alleged cause which I have more frequently found to be put forward by reluctant authorities is their inability to look forward to obtaining an economicrent on 2/3rd of the cost of construction as we are suggesting&quot;they should seek to do by 1927, and the fear that they will therefore find themselves burdened with a heavier charge thanthe penny rate limit.4, STATE OF THE BUILDING TRADE.In conjunction with high cost, this is the mostserious Issue of all.-    During the early months of the year there was much unemployment in the building trade, and in response to instructions I urged authorities to push forwardmany public worksc   . From May onwards, however, the period ofindecision began to pass.away, and now there is practically no unemployment in the building trade *     The ranks of thebuilding trade labour- also have been much depleted during theWar, not only by War losses, but by men drifting into other occupations in which they prefer to continue, and by the cessation of the normal entry of apprentices.     These factorsadded together probably represent a shortage of normal pre-warbuilding labour of more than 200,000 men.Further/(H,ll)
Farther, at the present time it appears that60$ of the building trade is employed on repair work,After a time this ef course, will diminish, but It is themost attractive form *?f work for the small builder,re-quiring no tenders, little trouble, and providing goodprofits .During the past three months contracts haveboen placed lavishly for works, places of amusoment, factory and shop extensions of different kinds all over the country,and they arc being pressod forward in many cases regardless of cost, the Contractors being permitted in many cases togive 26. or 3d  or hour or even more in excess cf the districtrate to building labour, and thereby attracting them fromHousing.   For example, three weeks ago the number of brick-layers cn one of our housing schemes dropped from 160 to 42in cne week from this cause.    Por similar reasons at Lincoln,although the Ministry of Labour has given all the help it could,there has been practically no progress *n a good housing schemewhich was woll forward for nearly three months.The effect ef this abundant employment in thebuilding trade further is directly responsible for anInflation of the tenders for housing.The high cost has praotically killed private house-building, and the whole body of speculative housebuilders are standing outside, whilst large numbers ofbuilders   wha are ascustomea to tendering   and contracting,having plenty of other remunerative work, aro not activelyparticipating,
-5.- &apos;   480XT .   .REMEDIES   FOR THE   DELAY,( (A), ACTION TAKEN * and (B) , FURTHER PROPOSALS,)&apos;(A,)o ACTION TAKEN.retire&apos;ETITIQN OF APPROVALS,The . approvals for houses cf which full detailshave already been submitted have usually been for a small number of accepted types on existing road frontages4   Inorder to provide for the operation of the new,agreements with builders/(mentioned in (2) below). I have given instructions for the increase of the numbers of groups ofhouses for which detailed typical plans have already beenapproved.   This will mean that the sanctioned plans for30,000;houses can be extender! to CO,000 in a few weeks time,(2).    CO-OPERATION OF BUILDERS.It is vital that we should obtain the assistancein every locality both of contracting builders and of house-builders.   The ?-ho!e of these are now covered by the twoagreements which have been entered into with,these branchesof the building trade:-(a)      Agreement with Federated Builders. This agreementwhioh has been arrived at with the dulnt Industrial Council(Resettlement Committee) and the Builders Federations, provides,for assembling federated builders in the chief areas and forthe making of agreements with them for the erection withina specified time of an agreed number of houses, of which the types, specifications otc. are already approved and available.(b).      Agreement with House-Builders.   The house-buildersare men who have built&quot;tEeTvast majority ef working-classhouses in the past but they are not accustomed to tenderingand contracting.   They have now established an organisation with a Committee working with the Ministry on similar lines to the federated,builders.   By this means we seek to obtainproposals from the house-builders in the different localities for providing on partly developed sites acceptable types of houses which they have been accustomed to build.   Te are, of course,taking care to. secure a better lay-out of the houses uponthe sites, giving more space about them than formerly.   Thisagreement will only be allowed to apply to a limited&apos; numberof houses to be provided during the next twelve months,(3). NSf AND CHEAPER TYPES OF HOUSES,The printed sheet attached shows the new schemesof new construction which have been approved.   In thecases of the four firms marked, they are prepared to supply the houses in large numbers, and we have notified public authorities and are urging their adoption wherever possible.The price of these new types of houses promises tc work out from  550 upwards.   It has been necessary te get trial housesconstructed before we were justified in pushing them.   Thishas now b.;en done, and they will, I am satisfied, be *extensively adopted, if the firms can competently provide them at the prices&apos; named.
m     At    -(4),- AUTHOR IT IBS III DSFAUI/P,All local authorities1 provisional schemes whichwere due to be sent in bsfor: 1st ivovember are now beingscrutinised,   A short-list has been prepared of those whom we may have to fine in default and it consists cf two categories, namely those in which we shall act ourselvesdirectly, and those in which we shall invite County councils to operate in place of the local authority in default, an examination of their needs has been made and available and suitable sites marked down for action as soon as the decision can legally be taken.   In these cases we shall negotiatedirectly with the builders on house plans already available.Arrangements have also been made with the Office of Vorksto. assist in the Metropolitan Area, and their help may berequire a   els ewhere .- IOML PROPOSALS,(5). Action on the above mentioned lines can be taken under the existing powers, but I am satisfied that sufficientlyrapid progress will not be made unless the additional proposalswhich I now make can be accepted and the additional statutory powers secured,(a).     FINANCE (Housing Loan),&apos;Some two months ago the Treasury arranged withthe Ministry cf Health that they would set up a Committeewhich vould consider proposals for facilitating the financing of local authorities.   But unfortunately it has notbeen possible, I am informed, to get the Committee started.&apos;I am confident that we shall not succeed in removing a just ,cause of hesitation, and one which is very commonly a realbarrier, unless we can readily finance authorities who arenot able to finance themselves,   There are at the present timemany who are floundering about in the market, the banks declin-ing to assist them, and many of them have practically suspendedaction until they can get some assurance of financial, assistance,I may quote vrexham., Edmonton, Tottenham, ?:ast Ham as places where there is a.real housing need, and where I am convinced1they are quite unable to raise the money themselves.   the financing might either take the form cf Housing Ecnds orHousing Bonds with a Premium attached or a general Loan,&apos;I put forward these proposals In the absence of a report fromthe suggested Treasury Committee, because I am sure that wecannot afford to delay any further In this matter,(b)       ASSISTANCE T0-PRIVATE ENTERPRIS&amp;It is most important that nothing should be done which will lower the improved standard cf housing, which isbeing secured by the present Government scheme; but I am convinced that in the present emergency it must be supplemented by a scheme for assisting private enterprise,   I proposethat this scheme should be limited to 100,000 house?, to becompleted within the next twelve months,   re haveexplored all manner of expedients and they resolve themselvespractically into paying a bonus, say, per cubic foot&apos;crhabitable floor-space to any person building a house of an approved type on an approved site within the&quot; limited time&apos;,This bonus would be payable to Co-operative Societies,workmen&apos;s Associations, private builders, landowners or other persons/
persons, on a certificate of the Medical Officer of Healththat the house has been completed and is fit for occupation.The bonus would not be applicable to tied houses andshould not exceed  150 for any house *   In many cases thebonuses would be paid through Building Societies, and in thesecases it would be possible to spread them over a term ofyears by the State recouping the Building Society over the agreed term,   In either event the cost to the State wouldbe &apos;l^ss than half the amount of the subsidy payable tolocal authorities.(C) LUXURY,BUILDING.After discussing the matter cn different occasionsboth with the Housing Group of Members of Parliament andwith the Building Trade, I find a general acquiescence in-theproposal that where buildings.of a non-essential natureare restricting the building of houses, I should be equippedat least with temporary powers, to prohibit such buildingduring a given term,     This is covered in the draft bill attached to my Cabinet Memorandum (C.Pt3).(D) POKER TO SUPPLEMENT AUTHORITIES&apos; SCHEMES., &apos;The difficulty of prolonged negotiation toobtain the agreement of local authorities when they are notactive but can scarcely be found technically in defaultrenders it necessary that I should ask the Cabinet to give me authority, in pursuance of Section 16 of the 1919 Act,to prescribe that works undertaken to supplement a localauthority1s scheme would form a part,, for financial purposes,of the local schemed.(E) ADDITIONAL BUILDING LABOUR..Some months ago, in concert with the Ministryof. Labour, I earnestly invited the. Joint IndustrialGountil to co-operate in schemes for augmenting building labour.   So far as I can ascertain, neither mastersnor men&apos; are disposed to render any real assistance.&apos;.    an active propaganda is necessary on this question, and i suggest that the Minister of Labour should be asked to prepare proposals which the Government itself shall submit to theindustries to achieve the end in view.,.    I believe that the essentials of any such agreement are that in.regard to housing they should agree to piece-work, with security forpiece-work ratosy and.that they should agree also to theready entry of additional labour. Whatever we may do in regardto finance, or invoking the aid of. private builders and otherwise, we cannot meet the needs of the housing programmeunless there is a rapid augmentation of the building labourcf the country coupled with Improved production,(Sgd).
