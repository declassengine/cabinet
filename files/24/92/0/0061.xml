It is understood that the main reason advanced insupport of this proposal is to show the flag,    The latterproceeding is of undoubted value in normal times of peace inwaters like the Baltic.xperienee&apos;&apos; has, however, shown that the presenceof an odd light cruiser or destroyer in the variout. ports haslittle or no stabilising effect on local affairs since theGerman aggression became pronounce do     The inability of H.-M.Ships to&quot;do more than advise and the necessity for removingthemselves when matters became threatening have tended stillfurther to emphasise the fact that a we ale &quot;naval force isonly effective as long as the other side chooses to allow itto be so - in short, t(,the bluff has been called5&apos;if a British forcev however small, remains inBaltic waters during the winter months it appears certain^that there will be calls on this force from the various baltic states for protoction and assistancee   Refusal of such requestswould inevitably lessen British prestige in theso States;acquiescence would equally inevitably lead to operations onan ever increasing scale culminating eventually in the presenceof a force similar to that now employed.All light cruisers and destroyers have had a parti-cularly arduous period of service in the Baltic during thepast eight months.    The conditions,: which are unavoidable,are described as far worse than warl     Furtherpolitical, elements whichobtain in those ports.    As an instance of this danger, Bol-sheVIIf rirn&apos;T*fl.o:aridfl has olrAflrlTr &quot;hefin found &quot;in thk nneicoQoi rfo *shevik propaganda has already been found &quot;in the possessionBritish seamen, which would obviously have had its effectiiflh oft onthe weaker elementsIt would be necessary to limit the period ofservice to one month, bearing in mind the considerations out-lined and the unsuitability of light cruisers and destroyersto very cold weather.It is considered that the minimum force that itwould be worth while retaining there would he -2 light cruisers 1   ^ased at Copenhagen5 destroyers       j r     0The destroyers are necessary on account of the danger frommines;   it is not fair under peace conditions to ask cruisersto run the risk of being mined without some escorting forcoin a ttendance.It would he necessary for a force equal to theabove to proceed to the Baltic&apos;and return at frequent inter-vals for relief purposes, involving great expense.   Thisexpense would be&apos;added to by the necessary provision of fuel
at the &quot;base;   canteen stores, provisions, etc., would alsobe required should one of the ships have to proceed toLibau, etc.It is estimated that the cost for three months would amount approximately to  140,000 for fuel alone.   Therewould undoubtedly be other expenses, hut these arc so vaguethat anything nearer than the&quot; merest guess is impossible. 50,000 soon slips away in these indefinite expeditions.In conclusion the Admiralty desire to point outthat they are unable to see that the maintenance&quot; in thesewaters of what is really, in view of its size and combination,a non-fighting force, would result in any gain which is notmore than counter -&quot;balanced by the objections set forth above.In consideration of the considerable cost involved and the pressing need for economy, the Admiralty recommendthat the entire force be withdrawn -(Intel,)   B,4.11,19,Forwarded.(Intd.) &apos;:7oH.L.&apos;
