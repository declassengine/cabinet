0X1-   SUPPLIESoMemorandum for ...ne Cabinet by the First Lordof the Admiralty*I hope the Cabinet v/ill be willing at an early date to reconsider their decision in connection with the Anglo-French Agreement about Oil Supplies,.In the previous discussion, it was believed by thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary that in the early stages of the negotiations, there had been no proper appre-ciation of the aspect of tho easy from the point of view of high policy, and no proper consultation, or communicationwith the Foreign Office, Indeed, Lord Curzon was understood to say that tho Foreign Office knew nothing o.&apos; the mattertill the meeting held there on the 89th April,   How far this is from the true- history of the case will be seen fromthe following brief summary 02 tm history of thenegotiations17g12,18. The participation of the French in the Hesopotamianoilfields was first mooted whan Senator Berenger and twocolleagues met Sir J* Oadman and two colleaguesn60 1. 19* The French Ambassador wrote formally to our, Foreign Office.11.1. 19. l1he Foreign Office forwarded a copy of the ambassador&apos;s letter to the Petroleum Executive,.J5olw 19. At a conference at which Mr. long was in ths Chair,* and the Foreign Office represented, it was decided thatthe Government should at once signify its willingness toco-operate with Franco before she secured American assistance and before the country was forced by public decisions atthe Peace Conference to adopt in self-defence the policy ofco-operation to which it was now invited., -It was made clear that the area included in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company-s concession in Persias could not bediscussed or re-openedrlg. 19, At a meeting in Paris with Sit Ho Llewellyn^Smithin the Chair, and the Foreign Office represented by Sir L.Mallet, Mr. Tufton, and Mr0 Malkin, it was agreed that theFrench should participate to the extent of 25$a   With regardto Hativo Concessions, Sir A.

Mr- Balfour initialled the Memorandum with Bir L. -&apos;Mallet.   Sir Jt Cadman suggested that the Foreign Officemight prefer to conduct the negotiations, but was informed by Sir Ln Mallet that, as the subject was somewhat technical,he should deal with it and negotiate up to 30$.L2* 19.

A. 19.-4,19.4.19.4.19.4.19.5.19.,5.19.19.Sir L. Mallet, of the Foreign Office, Sir A. Hirtzel, endSir H. Llewellyn-Smith, in Paris.The Foreign Office and India Office proposedcertain alterations.The French (M. Berenger) agreed.The Board of Trade agreed to the Fronoh Agreement.The Colonial Office agreed to the French Agreement,The agreement was tiien amended to meet the wishes of the foreign Office and India Office, engrossed, andsigned by Mr. Long and M. Berenger in Paris.The Shell Agreement, out of whioh the French Agree-ment had arisen, came before the Cabinet.   Lord Curzon saidthat he personally had not been consulted, and was not sure that the foreign Office had concurred.At a meeting, with Lord Curzon in the Chair, theFrench Agreement and its bearing on the Shell Agreement, was discussed.   It was recommended that the Government shouldconour in it, subject to the concurrence of the V/ar Cabinetin the Shell Agreement, and to the Foreign Office concurrence in the French Agreement.The War Cabinet approved of the Shell Agreement.The Foreign Office concurred in the Frenoh agreement and sent a formal ratification to the French Ambassador*The Foreign Office forwarded a copy of the aboveletter to the Petroleum Executive.A complaint has, as I have already indicated, beenmade that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Office inLondon were not kept properly informed of our negotiations.Surely in face of the statement above, it is clear thatif there was any lack: of proper communication, it was not the fault of the Petroleum Executive,   I was fully informed ofeverything that took placo from the very beginning .   I was present at most of the interviews with the French Ministers.There was never any question that they were authorised bytheir Prime minister and their Government to act for France,It will be remembered that I have beon given an absolutelyfree hand by the Cabinet to act in all $ $%S1?ters ^ot theUnited Kingdom.   This was only one of many negotiations withthe French and other Governments;   and from the beginning,I laid it down as a rule to be most rigorously kept, that theForeign Office and all the other Departments concerned, wereto be kept informed of everything that was being done;, andthat their assent was to be obtained before any steps were taken, or any agreements drawn up.My /instructions were most faithfully obeyed;   andI would earnestly beg the Cabinet to re-oonsider the matter in the light of the facts disclosed in this Memorandum, which show how greatly we are committed to tho French Government,and. also in face of the great overwhelming fact that oil is becoming every day more vital to our national lifo;   andthat if wo lose the opportunities which have grown out of thewar, we shall probably never be able to regain our position,and shall undoubtedly suffer once again from a shortness ofsupplies which will graarfcly hamper our national aotion.4th November, 1919,(Initialled).H .L.
