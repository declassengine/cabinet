CHURCHILL.5th November, 1919.
APPENDIX A.DEMOBILIZATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. Six months have passed since a memorandum was issued explaining to thetroops the arrangements necessary for the Armies of Occupation and the principlesthat would be followed in demobilizing the great army of the war period. The planthen unfolded is well known. It may be briefly summed up as follows :--To let threemen out of four go and pay the fourth man double to finish the job ; these fourth men being picked out of those who had not joined up before the 1st January, 1916; had not passed their 37th birthday ; and had not got three or more wound stripes.It was also explained that Parliament would be asked to make a law prolonging the compulsory military service of all men kepi; under the above plan until the 30thApril, 1920, after which they were to be released with all convenient speed. This lawhas now been made.2. Anyone can see for himself to-day how necessary it was to do this. Peace isabout to be ratified, and but for this law we should in a few days be absolutelydefenceless and without any kind of military organization. We should have no army at all to garrison our Empire and the new provinces for which we have become responsible, or to make sure that the Germans keep their word. We should havethrown away not only all that we have worked so hard to gain in this great struggle,but also all that the British Empire had acquired before the war. It is lucky that we took the steps we did.3. Meanwhile all the time the old pre-war voluntary army is being re-made as fast as possible. Towards the re-making of this army we have already obtained 209,000volunteers for periods varying from one to nine years. These men are being used toform 154 battalions, 254 batteries and 31 cavalry regiments, in addition to other necessary units. But this takes time, especially as the men who re-enlist are entitledto two or three months&apos; leave before they join up for duty. Volunteering on the whole has been well maintained and has lately improved. The average weekly intake of recruits and re-enlisted, men is more than four times the usual rate before the war. Ifthis goes on it is likely that all men who actually fought in the field in the war will be released before the new Military Service Act expires, and it is hoped that a very largeproportion will have been released before the end of the present year. Thus we shouldbe able to provide for the defence of the British Empire in 1920 entirely by volunteers for the Regular Army and young recruits who did not join in time to share in thefighting.The above is not a pledge in any sense of the word, because no one can foreseewhat will happen, and Parliament must remain supreme to take whatever steps arenecessary for the common safety. It is, however, a very clear indication of what webelieve is likely to happen, and what we are trying to bring about.4. Already since the Armistice nearly 3,000,000 men have been demobilized, leavingaltogether in the Army 1,200,000, including the 209,000 volunteer Regulars. Theseare distributed roughly as follows : Army of the Rhine, including the troops in France and flanders..................... 420,000Army of the Black Sea      .........      ...... 41,000Army of the Middle East............... 105,000Army   of  India   (including   demobilizable  men   from mesopotamia, temporarily detained in India)   ...      ... 76,000Home Army, including Ireland, the Volunteer RegularArmy now being formed, and about 165,000 non-effectives,sick and wounded and men awaiting demobilization   ... 534,000Detachments in Russia      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 17,000Detachments in Italy        M*      ......      ...      ... 7,000(7627) A 2
5. We now propose, assuming that Peace is ratified by the 1st August next, tomake further reductions as folJowB : The Army of the Rhine, which now consists of 10 divisions, will be reduced to2 divisions by the late autumn. This will effect a saving of about 150,000 men. the clearing up in France and Flanders is also proceeding well, and as soon as the german prisoners have been sent home the men who are guarding them will become available.Altogether, by 1st November it is hoped that the force in France and Flanders willhave been reduced by more than 100,000 men.Owing to the evacuation of the Caucasus, which will take place in the autumn, theBritish troops in the Army of the Black Sea (which is the Army enforcing the peace on Turkey and Bulgaria) will be reduced by .10,000 men.All troops in Russia, except those who volunteer to join the Military Missions, willbe brought home before the winter, and those who were in North Russia during last winter will, it is anticipated, start for home in September, excepting always such menas may volunteer to stay.Nearly 200,000 men will be released from the Home Establishment as german prisoners return home, as wounded recover, and as demobilization proceeds.Thus, by the end of the year the British Army, which is now 1,200,000, will bereduced to about half that number.6. There are two parts of the world, however, where we cannot at present reduce our armies at all. In the Middle East, including Egypt, and in India, where the afghans and Bolshevik agents are making trouble, we must maintain our forces at full strength. But these are also the very places where there is the largest proportion ofmen who have been away from their homes for the longest time. As we cannot reducethese men we have to replace them. Before we can bring them home according to the promise which has been made, we must find men to relieve them. In these distanttheatres there are also the difficulties of making the necessary shipping arrangements ;but it is expected that the Regular troops who are to form the permanent garrison ofIndia will all be despatched by the end of this year to release the present temporarygarrison. These Regular units are now being sent out, two or three battalions everyweek, and they will relieve an equal number of demobilizable men whom we havehitherto been forced to retain in India. First among those to come home from india will be those who were already on their way from Mesopotamia and who were stoppedin India on account of the outbreak there.We have not jet, however, got enough volunteer Regular units ready to be able toprovide reliefs of volunteers for the armies in the Middle East, including Egypt. It isnecessary, therefore, that drafts should be made up out of retainable men of the armies of Occupation who may become surplus on the Rhine, or in France and Flanders, or athome, to go out to the Middle East and relieve their comrades who have been away from home so much longer and are entitled to demobilization. These reliefs will not,however, be kept abroad indefinitely. They will in their turn be relieved as soon asthe Regular troops have been organized and can take over from them.7. All sorts of suggestions have been made as to the order in which men should now be released from the Army ; and there are many hard cases, both compassionateand pivotal, which deserve attention. But the time is getting short now. The endof the task is coming into sight, and it is better to keep to certain broad and simplerules which everybody can understand, even if individual cases of hardship are caused.The following, therefore, are the rules on which we shall now proceed : (i.) Definite orders have been issued that all 1914 men, except those in India andany there may be in Russia, shall begin their journey home within one month of the signature of peace, namely, by the 28th July, and that all1915 men and men over 37 years of age, except those in India and Russia,shall start for home within two months of the signature of Peace, namely, bythe 28th August. All other men who are now desirous and eligible fordemobilization under existing regulations will start for home within threemonths of the signature of Peace, namely, by the 28tb September. Theabove programme of releases will apply equally to men who, althoughdemobilizable, have hitherto been retained for essential purposes usuallydescribed 9s &quot; Machinery of Demobilization,&quot; but will not of course apply tomen who, although eligible for demobilization, have volunteered to stay on for a period with the Armies of Occupation.
16th July, 1919.(7627)(ii.) All Derby men who joined the colours for service before the 1st July, iy 16,excepting those in India and Russia, will have begun their journey home bythe 1st November.(iii.) All 1914, 1915 men, and all Derby men who joined the colours before the 1stJuly, 1916, who are in India, will similarly have started for home by the 1stDecember, if not released earlier, provided always that no unexpectedtrouble occurs in that country.(iv.) All troops in Russia who have not volunteered to join the Missions, will have started for home before the winter, as already explained.(v.) As from 1st July, no conscript soldier will be sent to India or Mesopotamia,and no Derby man will be sent further from home than the Army of the rhine.8. Finally, it is hoped that it may be found possible to release in the early spring of next year all the remaining men of all classes who fought-in the war, that is to sayembarked for any theatre of war or garrison abroad before the Armistice was signed,excepting always such as may have volunteered to continue serving. It is impossible,however, at this distance of time to make any definite plans in this respect. Moreover,it must be clearly understood that, if Peace is not ratified, or if the ratification is delayed,or if the Germans break out again, or if there are risings in India or Egypt, or serious trouble in Turkey, the above programme will have to be modified; and here and thereshipping delays may possibly occur. But assuming all goes well we have every hopeand intention of being able to give effect to it.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
