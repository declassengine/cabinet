The establiahment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration,to be termed tlie Industrial Oourt.2.    The appointment of Courts of Enquiry to make publioenquiry into disputes.3*    The continuance until 30th September, 1920, of theprinciple of the \7agea (. temporary Hegulation) Actsunder which wages were maintained for twelve monthsafter the Armistice at a level not less than that atwhich they stood at that time.2.    The Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act 1918 was intendedto last for sis months only, but in May 1919* following f jointrecommendation from the jSmployers and Trade Unions on theNational Industrial Conference, the Act was extended for afurther period of six months.    The Act maintains v/ages at thelevel at which they stood at the time of the Armistice,&apos; subjeotto inoreases or deoreaaes settled by agreement by the partiesor by awards of the Court of Arbitration whioh was set up bythe Act.    This Court of Arbitration has &quot;been instrumental in settling a very 1arg&amp; number of induatrial disputes during the twelve months in which it has been in operation.    It followedupon the Committee on production which had been, the principalarbitration tribunal during the war, and the members of theCourt of Arbitration are for the moat pa rt the same as themeraberQ of the old Committee on Production.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour3-.

It is theoonoidorod opinion of tho prinoipallabour, leaders    an-i-opini on which is&apos; aha red by most employers -that: &quot;compulsory arbitration&apos;1- la impracticable and in&apos; the production-son t Bill: w*at.ia- proposed la that an&apos; arbitration tribunalestablished; hy- the.

In &quot;Clio&quot; 7agos [Temporary Regulation) Aot.   Represent ft on&amp; hare -^a^made by a numbor of tho Joint Industrial Councils to tho offeetthat tho Minister of Labour should have power to mako binding on tho whole of an industry awards or agrooments as to wagos andconditions of employment which nay bo arrived at between EmployorsxAssociations and Trade Unions, and tho Report of the provisionalJoint Committee of tho Industrial Conforenoe included a rocommend-at i on on this sub j ect.6. It should be noted that Trade Union opinion is divided uponthe question of obtaining tho vox-tor to extend awar&amp;r and agreementsindicated in paragraph 5,   The matter formed the subject of aReport by the Industrial Council in 1913, when it was recommendedthat, subject to an enquiry made by an authority appointed by theBoard of Trade, an agreement entered into between Associations ofemployers and workmen representing a substantial body of those inthe trade or district., should, on th$ application of the partiesto the agreement-, be made applicable to the whole of the trade or district concerned,, providing that the agreement fulfils certainrequirements laid down regarding proper notice being given by either party of an intended change affecting conditions as towages or hours, and that no change and no stoppage of work shouldtake place until the dispute had been investigated and pronouncedupon.     The question was also considered by the Trade unionCongress in 1912, the Labour Party in January, 1913 and theTrades Union Congress in September 1913.     The proposal was rejected at ail these meetings..The provisional Joint Committee of the Industrial Conferenceof 1919 recommended as follows:-&quot;wliero an agreement is arrived at between ropresent-ative organisations-, of employers and Trade unions in any trade laying down a minimum rate of wages,the Minister of Labour shall have power, after. -investigation., to apply such minimum rate withsuch modification as he may think fit, to all employers engaged in the trade falling within thescope of the c gre oment.!IIn/
In view of the above reoommouclationa and of thorepre:sontations made to the Ministry of Labour it was decidedto brins the matter to the&quot;notice of the Parliamentary Committeeof tho &quot;Oracles Union Congress vltli a view to tho   uestion being discussed by the Congress which was hold, in oeotember of thisyear.     Apparently opinion was divided among the members ofthe Parliamentary Committee and the matter &quot;as shelved.     Itwould appear from this that there is no very largo body ofopinion in the Trafte Union world sufficiently keen on thematter to have put      forward for discussion at the Congress,So far as regards employers the matter has been referredto the Confederation of Employers1 Organisations and their view is in favour of the power being sought0On the whole, having regard to the representations whichhave been made by a considerable number of Joint industrial councils it rppears advisable that the power should be obtainedibut that it should be exercised only in cases that ere coriteclear and when the circumstances of the case ere sufficiently strong to warrant the Industrial Court in advising the. P-m-Minister to make the extension.     Clause 5 of the Bill has been drawn so as to give considerable discretion to the Ministerand to the Industrial Court ana so as to ensure that all parties interested may have ample opportunity to representtheir views before the extension is made.7. Part II of the Pill gives the Minister of Labour power-to appoint Courts of Pnouiry to eneuiro into the causes and circumstances of trade disputes, and enables the Minister incases where he thinks it desirable, to give power to a Courtof Pnquiry to summon witnesses,, obtain pro auction of documents,books, papers, etc.   The object of this proposal is to &quot;enablethe Minister of Labour to appoint an authoritative body to enquire into the causes and circumstances of a dispute,particularly/
particularly one likely to affect the community asi a whole,or any lcrge section thereof, and to make an immediatepublic report bo that public opinion may be guided as to the merits and circumstances of the dispute.     It is thought thatan authoritative and impartial report made by persons who arcin no way connected with the parties to a dispute would bo a useful means of bringing to bear the pressure of public opinionupon either Trade Unions or employers and the procedure willavoid the necessity of a series of ex-parte statements of thekind which appear in the press from time to time during - theprogress of strikes.   This proposal stops &quot;short of the pro-visions of the Canadian Act&apos;, under which an attempt was made -to prevent strikes, in public utility services pending enquiry,but in practice the restrictive features of the Canadian Acthave proved practically a dead letter.8a Cart III of the Bill extends with certain modificationsthe provisions of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act 1918&apos;.The principal modifications are that the clauses of the Wages(Temporary Regulation) Act 1918 under which employers could be compelled to go to arbitration and &apos;!,ere under penalties to observe the award while at the same time the Unions were free to go to arbitration or not and were free to strike against theaward have been abandoned.   The effect of Pert III is that forthe period ending 21st Povember 1920 employers &quot;ill be underobligation to continue to pay the proscribed rates of vagosthat were in force at the date of the Armistice&quot;, or such otherrate as may have been substituted for the Armistice rates in-accordance with the procedure of the wages (Temporary Hegulat-ion) Act 1918, namely by award of the Court of Arbitration orby an agreement approved by the Minister.   There will no longer&apos;Hy an opportunity to the Trades Unions to claim compulsory arbitration in regard toan alteration in wages and (unless by astrike) the only way in which an alteration can be made willbe by agreement or by voluntary/
voluntary arbitration.     &quot;Tho position will therefore, be that,while tho Government will propose to give a guarantee to maintainwages at their present lovol for the period mentioned,, there conbe no change in wages   unless tho parties agree to such change or unless they proceed voluntarily to arbitration under  art    c-f thoBill,9,   With regard to the period for which the principles oxtho Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act should be extended, it is tobe noted that tho Trade Unions. represented by tho feCeratign 0:1!iingineoring and Shipbuilding Trades; &apos;the Amalgamated o2Engineers, the National Union of General Workers and th/- !&apos;f:;ade union side of the. Provisional Joint Committee of the national Incus trialConference have intimated that in their view the Act should toextended for a further period   of one year, *8* to IToveLoher 192Q.In the settlement that was made with the raij.wa370.en the maintenanceof &quot;existing rates of wages was guaranteed up to 3&amp;th raptember 1920and this date is the date that was offered by the icigineeringEmployers^ Federation to the IronfoundersT Societies who are onstrife, the employers offer being that nthe present rates of wagesshall continue in operation until the 30th September 19-20&quot; *   Onbehalf of the Employers, the Confederation cf Employers * Organisa-tiers have agreed that the principle of the Wages  ot should becontinued for a further twelve months., although they have stated thatthey are not willing that the Government should continue the one-sided character of the Act under which employers can be compelledto go to arbitration and can be prosecuted if they fail to observe the award while the Trade Unions are free, not only to reiuao togo to arbitration, but also to disregard the award when it is given.It is apparent that a good deal of the presont industrial unrest
would bo modified if it were made clear to the TradeUniens that there is no fear of any fall in wages (unless &quot;by &apos;agreement or by arbitration) until .30th September 1.920,10.   The Bill confers upon the Industrial Court - very important and far-reaching powers and it will be necessary togive the members of the Court an appropriate status; thepersons who compose the Court must possess the confidence ofthe industrial community and, in addition; it. must be madeapporent that the Court is regarded by the&apos; Government as a&apos;tribunal holding a judicial position approximating to that ofthe High Court.11.   The Bill must become law prior to the terminationof Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act.viz, 21st november and the matter is therefore one of urgency0   A promise has beengiven to submit copies of the draft Bill to the employers andTrade Union representatives on Thursday and Friday next so aato securey as far as possible, an agreed measure.12,   Authority is sought therefore to submit the draft attached hereto J.g. a Bill providing f;r;*-(a) the establishment of a permanent Curt of Arbitration to-be to/mod thr liid&amp;jJtrsal Curt) for the purposes of voluntary arbitration in trade disputes;,.(b) the enforcement of awards by civil aoticn and the pro-hibitien cf tne&apos;use of Trade Uni&apos;n funds in support -of a strike against an award;(c) the appointment of ad hoc Ccurts :f Enquiry to mak.&apos;public enquiry into disputes and to publish reportsthereon;(d) the extension, by order, in suitable cases to the wholeof a trade of awards and agreements which already cover a substantial proportion of a trade;(e) the extension until 30th September 1920 of the principleof the Kages (Temporary Regulation) Act, under whichwages are maintained at their present level, unlessaltered by award or by agreement.(Intd.)   tUS*H,Inistry of Labour,I Montague House,j        27th October,1919.
