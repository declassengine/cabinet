Treasury sanction to the appointment of Directors atthe new Settlements proposed to he acquired at Button bridge and Wainfleet is &quot;being sought.The reports received from the Directors shOY/ that atPatrington, arrangements have now teen made to take on anadditional number of ex-Service men v/ho have proved suitable oninterview.     These rill occupy all the available accommodation.The set of Steam Tackle at this Settlement ploughed 69 acres andcultivated 30 acres during the week.     A motor lorry has now beensent to this Settlement.     At HoJbeach, all work is going enunder favourable conditions and&quot; most of the settlers arc busywith their potato crops.     It is neoed to finish harvesting the potato crop during the early part of the present week.     At HeathHill, the settlers arc making satisfactory progress, and come ofthe probationers are anxious to get their holdings.     It is to be hoped that the new cottages will &quot;be ready in the Spring, in orderthat additional holdings nay be let as from, next Lady Day.     AtPcmbrey, temporary buildings and sheds for use in connectionWith the building operations on this Estate are nov: being erectedby the Office of Works.       20 fat cattle, from this Settlement  &apos;are being sold weekly and arc realising good prices.     Many ofthe sheep, however, are not doing well and steps are beingtaken to dispose of the worst.     At I^ViG^ton, the acreage ofautumn sown crops is now:-   wheat 100 acres, beams 11 acres,and winter oats 34 acres.     At this Settlement also development is being delayed owing to the lack of accomr.:odatiOh, but theOffice of works have commenced work on the cottages.     At ^! sbur ,150 acres of wheat have been cewn ,     A large acreage of stubbles w&amp;a.was steam ploughed during the week.     50 tons of potatoes weresold at  8.10. per ton.     Two additional probationers were sentto the Berwick St . James Settlement during the&apos; t       .      week.   90acres of wheat have been sown to date at this Settlement.     a visit has been paid to     . -Vantage with a representative of theOffice of Works who was asked to fake full epecifications of therepairs required to the existing buildings with a view to theserepairs being carried out at the earliest possible date,     sites for 4 new cottages were also selected.     Winter cats at this settlement arc looking well and the wheat is just beginning toshow through.     At Tltchfielfl:; sites for twelve new cottageshave now been selected and the Office of Works have been askedto proceed with this ^ork, as well as with the repairs required tothe existing buildings.     The lard to be: sub-divided&apos; into smallholdings next year has bren steam ploughed during the week, andit is proposed to drees it with lasio Slag and so?/ rye, whichwill be ploughed in as green manure in the Spring, in order toget the land in better condition before the new holdings are-allotted .Work of Agricultural Exocmtivo Committees.%^&apos;^jon^.J(and^by^^-ecuj^/r^.Cpnimitt cc^    The Board have authorised&quot;the Sussex   A.1.0. to enter on and take pcs-sssoAoa-of .3-90 acres of land known as Saltdean and Bannings Farm,Rottingdcan.     The condition of the holding was first reportedto the Committee in March, 1917, when the land was being farmedon behalf of the owner.     Although the Committee, assisted theeraor with labour and horses, the state of cultivation remainedunsatisfactory, and the Committee were, therefore:. authorisedto take possession in August, 1917.     As the farm however waslet about that time to a tenant who. the Committee had reason to
hope, would improve   the cultivation, the Committee did not enter,on the land.    For a time there was an improvement, but of latethe condition of the farn has become much worse, and on this account the owner is unable to l*;t the land to another tenant.There arc on the holding a few cottages hut no farmhouse, and theCommittee propose to farn the land in conjunction with tho landthey are already faming on the Peacchavcn Estate.    Although the holding io at present in a derelict condition, the Committeearc satisfied that they will be able to produce a large amount ofcorn, and that no expense will ultimately fall on public funds.Determination of Tenancies.    The Board have issued an Orderdetermining the tenancy of a holding 6f 89 acres known as CliftonHall Farm, near Manchester.    The tenant failed to comply witha Cultivation Order served on him in April last, and the farm,which has been under the observation of the Committee for oometime, has gone from bad to worse.    Although the tenant workshard, he is stated to be incompetent, and there did not appear tobe any prospect of improvement under his management.Land Drainage.Ouao^Draft Order.    The enquiry with regard to tho OuseDrainage order was held at Cambridge last week, and lasted five days.    The objections of the various fen authorities and of owners of land in the fens were heard in the first three days,and a virtual agreement was arrived at on most of the points raised, the details of which vail, of course, have to be worked out, and the draft Order revised accordingly.    The remaining two days were occupied with objections frem upland authorities andthose living in the uplands.     The chief objector was the Hunts.County Council on behalf of the upland portion of that County.They commenced with a decided apposition to the Order, buteventually submitted a formula for the revision of the Order whichwould satisfy their claims, and this formula will probably affarda basis for a settlement of the conflicting interests of thefens and uplands.    This ie the firBt occasion 4n which theprinciple of a single drainage beard for the whole of any rivervalley in England has been accepted by the whole of the interests concerned in the valley, and the first occasion on which there-has been any agreement by those representing the uplands tocontribute to the cost of oarrying their water through thelowlands.River Quac Dredging.    The two \Prieetman dredgers aboveDenver Sluice are working satisfactorily;   the third willprobably start work next week.    Excavation to date;-By hand labour 800 oubio yards.By dredgers:Previous two weeks &apos; 1800      &quot;      &quot;Week ending 24th Cot. 1160       11     &quot;Total    10960Land Reclamation.The Wash. HX Shore.     It has been arranged to transferthis work to the Drainage Section on the 14th prox,    About 100unemployed Arrived fror.: Nottingham on the 15th inst,but appeared to
&quot;be accompanied by agitators who persuaded most of them to leave onthe grounds that the rate per hour of 10-J-d. was below TradeUnion Rates,     It will be remembered that this rate was fixed by arbitration.     Since this date Employment Exchanges have been requested to supply men in smaller     :  lots at a time.     Themaximum number working last week was 100, the average 83.     It isprobable that in relief work of this kind, which inevitablyattracts mainly the worst class of labour, such difficulties willrecur, and in the interests of economy, it may be a matter for future consideration whether the &quot;relief&quot; policy should not be abandoned, and regular navvies employed to complete the work.With the introduction cf the present bonus system, however, themen&apos;s possible earnings have been increased (while at the same timecosts ha^e been reduced) , and it is expected that improvement inthe class and number of workers will show itself.Cornwall.     The auction sale of those huts which are surplus to the requirements of other Sections of the Board, takes, place at Falmouth on the 7th instant.The estimate of expenditure during the current .   &apos;financial year .on reclamation may bo now reduc d from  loo,700to  43,000.An enquiry has been received from the Board of Trade withreference to a proposal by a private owner to enclose 400 acres ofland on the Wash Foreshore at Dawsmere, near Holbeach.     This land was inspected in January last, and considered to be ripe forenclosure.     The Board of trade have therefore been informed that,in the opinion of this Department, this particular privateenterprise should be encouraged.Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey.-Among the applications received during the past week were33 for redemption, 6 for altered apportionment, and 3 for the merger of tithe rentcharge in addition to 6 for the enfranchisementof copyhold lands.The following statement gives particulars of theredemption applications with comparative figures for thecorresponding week in previous years:-Fourth Week    Voluntary    Compulsory    Total              Total Rent-in October.

Except in the case of the Allesley redemption, the
applications for redemption were made prior to the War and theproceedings had &quot;been held in abeyance during the period ofiistilities.     In each of these cases the lands charged &quot;&apos;ith titherentoharge had become divided into numerous small properties, and theassessments of redemption money and expenses had tc be collected from210 property owners in all.    Generally speaking, one owner in each area charged v:ith a tithe rent charge had been compelled to pay thewhole of &quot;the tithe rentcharge charged on the area and had not taken steps to recover contributions from the other owners, so that thegreater number of property owners concerned were in ignorance of thefact that their properties were liable for tithe rentcharge.    More-over, many of the properties had changed hands since the lands weresurveyed prior to the War with a vie&apos;&quot; to redemption, and additionalrork was entailed, in tracing and communicating with the new owners.The redemptions rere, however, completed without recourse to county court proceedings, and the landowners were evidently satisfied vriththe explanations as to their liability which they received frojg theBoard.The worh dealt with under the Inclcsure Acts includes someOrders of Exchange under Dection 5 of the Enclosure Aot, 1854,legalising informal exchanges under which parties ha^e for some yearsheld possession of lands.Buildings and Eouipment. &apos;Appointment of Architect.

These * when determined by the Estates *Management Branch, may involve a good deal of complicatedwork.(o)   Eouairs^    On each farmstead, only the most essentialrepairs have been done, and extensive repairs are still requiredto all the old buildings.Owing to the isolation of this settlement, it isdifficult to pay sufficiently frequent visits from headquarters,or to obtain satisfactory contracts from a builder,.     It is also important to place under   proper supervision the stocksof building materials of all kinds now on the site.     It is therefore proposed,to appoint a Clerk of Works for this settlement.Holbj^cJl-    The claim of Mr. Jellings of Peterborough inrespect of building work carried out at Holbeach has now been settled.     Mr.   &quot;Jellings claimed  9,648..     This sum, however,included  1,955 in respect of items already covered by anagreement with him of February last.     His claim was thereforereduced, to  7,693 and Mr. Jellings offered to&apos; accept  7,500 infull settlement.

A meeting ras held, at the officeof the Petroleum Executive on October 21st with reference to thisscheme.   Prom experiments already made, the Superintendent of theFactory indicated that the plant could produce 200 tons per weekby a fermentation process, provided that they obtained sufficient supplies of raw mate rials.   The best rav material so far obtainedras the ordinary mangold.   It ras estimated that to obtain an output of 200 tons per reek the permanent cultivation of about ,000 acres would he required.

Two more sales of harness have beenarranged at the Willesden Depot:    one on November 6th and afinal sale on November 27th.
Coal for Agriculture.The position would appear to be easier, fewer complaintshaving been received during the week ending 25th October.   reports from Yorkshire, .3ssex, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire show,however, that St jam Cultivation and Threshing have been delayedowing to shortage and the poor quality of the coal available.The Coal Mines Department have at the request of the Board given instructions to their Divisional Officers that the supply of coal for Threshing and Steam Ploughing is of equal importance withthat for Household purposes and that where there is a shortagethe available coal must he shared.ii
Inspectors of Maohinory.Lang &quot;otato Planting Machine.   This machine was inspected inoperation on a farm near Hutfield.   There are a number of novelfeatures in the design.   It is devised to plough, plant and drillartificial manure in one ope ration.   The planting mechanismincludes a clever arrangement for remedying any failure in the primary device to deposit a potato.   The weakest point in the machine is the plough, the beam of which broke during the trial:it will probably be necessary to re-design the machine to overcomethis weakness, but an attempt to remedy this defect is likely to upset the balance of the- machine-.   Otherwise the machine appearsto possess a substantial advantage over other planting machinesupon the market.&quot;Service&quot; Motor Cultivator and Tractor.   This is a small 4-g-H.P. tractor operated by a man who walks behind and controls it.It is a British machine built on lines similar to the American&quot;Beeman&quot; but of rather better and stronger design.   Both machinesare intended primarily for orchard cultivation for which it isfrequently difficult or impossible to use even the lightest of farm tractors.   The machine was not in operation, but it has beenarranged that a technical officer shall attend a practicaldemonstration,&quot;HewBome&quot; Disc Harrow.   Mr. i\, Nersome, a smallholder atLeftwich, Cheshire, has invented a double-disc harrow for tractorwork which embodies several new ideas of value, tending to easeOf manipulation and freedom from clogging.   It is at present onlyin the &quot;model&quot; stage, but a toohnical officer was able to givesuggestions for improvements which Ur. Hewsome will adopt and again submit the design to the Board.   The design promises to bevery cheap in construction, in comparison with others now on themarket, and to be suitable for rapid multiplication,   a finalopinion must await actual field trials.Potato Digger Trials.   In co-operation with officers of theDepartment a comparative trial of three potato digging machines -the Hoover, the Ransome, the Wilson - and an ordinary horseplough ^ras held by the Agricultural Department of Leeds University.The trial was very carefully arranged and carried out so as toprovide exact data.   The dynamometer employed was provided bythe Department and a technical officer of the Department explainedits use to tho students present.   A full report of the trials isto be prepared by the University Agricultural Department.&apos; jduc at ion.Special Schemes.        A conference has been held with officersvof the Land Division in regard to the experimental farm at MethwoliNorfolk, at which the respective spheres; of the IntelligenceDepartment and the Land Supplies Department in carrying out the experiment have been defined.   A general Scheme of working hasbeen drawn up by the Intelligence Department;   the actual workof carrying out the scheme will be undertaken hy the Land &apos;Department;   joint inspections being made from time to time byInspectors of both Departments.Higher Agricultural Iducation.Scale Hayne Agricultural College.   The curriculum proposed at the S&apos;-ale Hay no Agricultural College, which is expected to
open next year, has teen under consideration.   The CollegeAuthorities have teen informed that, while the question dependsto some extent upon the type of instruction which the neighbourinCounty Councils may desire to have provided in return for their financial support, the Board&apos;s opinion is that it would be costthat the College should not at first provide a three years&apos;course, &quot;but should combine a two years&apos; certificate course withFarm Institute courses of three months.   Two of these FarmInstitute Courses (before and after Christmas), to be taken inthe same or in successive sessions, would form a full FarmInstitute curriculum.   A special course for women might be givenin the summer as suggested by the College.   The Farm Institutework might be dropped gradually when separate provision is madefor it hy the Counties concerned and tho College could thenconcentrate uoon higher and longer courses,  including a fullthree years&apos; course corresponding to a Degree course inUniversities.County Agricultural &quot;Education.iDast Anglian Institute.of Agriculture.   The Board have been approached by the Board of Education with regard to the questionof the   ilssex County Council selling Britton&apos;1 c Hall Farm(approximately l&apos;i8 acres), at present forming part of the  DastAnglian Institute of Agriculture, which will not be required as an experimental farm when the Institute has been transferredte its new site.   The Board of Education have been informed thatthe Board of Agriculture are in general agreement with theaoheme for transferring the Institute to more suitable land and for acquiring a heavy land farm for demonstration purposes.Interviews with ,,rejrre sent at iyesjof^ Lo cai Authorit ies .Deputations have beerP received from DorsetT Leicestershire andLincolnshire (Eeeteven) and various questions connected withthe provision of agricultural education in those counties havebeen discussed.    In the course of discussion interestingopinions were expressed by the County Councils&apos; representatives on the subject of the organisation of Agricultural Educationwork if the &quot;Agriculture and Fisheries (Councils, etc.) Bill&quot;is passed.The question of the Agricultural Organisers ofLeicestershire and Lincolnshire (Kerteven) continuing to perform Dxecutive duties was also discussed and it wasintimated to the Councils&apos; representatives that the Board areprepared to allow the present arrangements to continue for atime.At the Dorset interview the Board&apos;s attitude towardsthe establishment of Farm Institutes was fully explained.   TheDirector of Education intends to ascertain whether there are any suitable buildings in the county which could be acquired by the Council and adapted as a Farm Institute.   The high cost of building at the present time points to such a coursebeing the only practicable one for the county at the moment.Proposed Farm Institute at Cannington.   Advice has beengiven to the Somerset Local Authority in regard to the adaptation of Cannington Court, which the Council have acquiredfor the purpose of a Farm Institute.
Dairying,Encouragement of Cheese Making.   In connection with thisscheme two special classes were this year-held at the LondonDairy Show for students who had attended the travelling cheesejjchools under the Board of Agriculture scheme, viz:-Class 59.   Small pressed cheese (four cheeses made at home notexceeding 8 Ids. each).   This class was well supported;   therewere 55 entries in all from twenty-two counties.   All the prizeswere gained by counties where previous to the war little or nocheese was made:   1st prize, Cornwall;   2nd and 3rd prizes,Northampton;   4th prize, Lincoln.Class 60.   Inter-county competition for a collection of twovarieties of cheese, four of each by ten individual exhibitorsin each county.   This class reoeived entries from twelvecounties but all did not arrive in time for competition.   WestSomerset (7 entries), 1st prize;   Stafford (3 entries), 2ndprize;   Wilts (2 entries), 3rd prize, and Berks (4 entries),4th prize.   This class might with advantage be arranged to takethe form of a yearly contest with a shield to be held by thevanning county for the year.Arable Dairy Farms.   Visits of enquiry and Inspections havebeen made in North Wales, Yorkshire, Durham, Warwickshire andWiltshire.   The energies of the staff have been largely centredin an endeavour to complete the arrangements concerned with thosecentres referred to last week as not being definitely settled.In the case of Canwell on the Birmingham Estatedifficulty has arisen with the sitting tenants who are demandingunreasonable compensation, but as a result of a conference with the Representatives of the Birmingham Town Counoil and the,tenants, those difficulties are now being overcome.In the case of the site in ../Durham, the CollieryCompany from whom the Board proposed to purchase land will onlysell on condition that no claim would be made against them for damage due to subsidence.   In consequence the Board called inthe services of the local Mines Inspector of the Board of Tradewho has reported that the risk of damage arising is considerable.The Colliery Company have been communicated with accordingly.In the meantime another site is being sought in that area.In North Wales a site near Denbigh has been foundwhich it is believed will prove suitable.   With regard to the site near Whitland mentioned last week, the arrangements withthe Small Holdings Committee are proceeding as rapidly aspossible .General Milk Situation.   There continues to be a fullsupply of Milk.   The Farmers seem to be satisfied butconsiderable agitation has arisen amongst wholesalers whdappear to hare overbought and who have become alarmed as totheir position fx or a the first of &quot;November when they will nolonger be able to recoup themselves by making their surplus intoproduct,   Some fear has been expressed regarding the effect ofthe situation on the Farmers&apos; Co-operative Societiesconducting Milk Depots but no complaint direct- from the societies themselves has reached, this Branch.

order to ensure that the men are still physically fit for vocational training.   Disabled men are passed to the Board by theMinistry of Pensions as physically fit for such training, butexperience has shown that some of the men may eventually provephysically unfit to continue such training.Provision of additional Training Centres.   The demand foragricultural training by disabled men makes it essential for anumber of new Centres to be provided.   These are being pressed forward, but there is much necessary delay in obtaining suitableland etc.   The Agricultural Executive Committees now seem to bealive to the necessity of submitting schemes for Centres.   CertainAgricultural Executive Committees are anxious to place disabledmen for training with farmers instead of at Centres, but this isbeing discouraged as much as possible for obvious reasons.Training of Disabled Officers.   Arrangements have been madefor training in flax production of a number of disabled officers who are proceeding shortly to British East Africa to settle on a&quot;Disabled Officers1 Colony&quot; which has been approved by theColonial Office.   These Officers - some 60 in all - will receivepreliminary training of nix weeks at the Board&apos;s Flax factories in Great Britain and will complete their training in British 3astAfrica.

Essex.    The horticultural Instructor has made a survey of theCounty with a view to the development of Horticulture therein.Yorkshire,     At a meeting of the Horticultural Uuh-ComiT.itteethe question of the establishment, of six experimental fruit plots was!discussed; and it was agreed that the Horticultural Instructor andthe ioard&apos;s Inspector should prepare a scheme of demonstration and.trial plots,Brecon and Radnor,    The Agricultural Education Committees ofthese counties have referred the subject of Horticultural instruction to the Farm Institute Joint Committee, and it is expected that aHorticultural Instructor will be appointed,M.Qrigomerye hi re.     Assistance has boen given to the AgriculturalOrganiser in drawing up a scheme of Horticultural Education.&apos;     Awhole time Horticultural Instructor will probably be appointed.Cultivation.Farm Orchard Survey.     The survey in the Tenbury District of..-or c ester shir e has been concluded and further visits have been madeto orchards in the Arlingham Disirict of Gloucestershire,Dor aetshire.     Orchards at Thorncombe have boen inspected and advice given &quot;as to pruning, thinning, etc.V/ales.    The Inspector reports that there is a remarkabledifference between the cottage gardens and allotments in rural districts and those in urban districts in Vales.     In the latter the holders are keen to grow every kind of crop, but in rural districtsthe potato excludes nearly everything else,     He attributes this inpart to the lack of knowledge on the part of the Velsh speakingpeople and considers that more &quot;literature&quot; in the helsh languageshould be circulated amongst them.Bee-keeping.An interesting report has been received from the YorkshireCouncil for Agricultural Education with regard to the bee-keepingactivities in that county.     In spite of the fact that inclementweather at a critical period greatly interfered with multiplicationnearly 100 nuclei have been distributed to shareholders from theoriginal 30 Dutch stocks.     A much greater number could have been disposed of had they been available and there is consequently along waiting list for next year.     There has been a considerabledemand for sugar and candy for winter -&quot;feeding, certificates havingbeen issued in respect of 2,952 hives up to the 16th October,This     figure is the more remarkable when it is remembered thatsugar for spring feeding was only applied for in respect of 577 hives.Fruit..and Vegetable Preservation.The ninth course in Fruit and Vegetable xJreservation heldat the Board&apos;s Kitchen from the 20th to the 24th instant, was wellattended.

Vincent Banks, was able to attend the Bristol Home Life &quot;Sxhibi-tion.     He reports that tho exhibit of bottled fruits and vegetables   iattracted considerable attention from the 50,000 people who visited the Shov/.     lie had very numerous enquiries as to the different methods of preserving, in some cases, from persons who had visited the &quot;Exhibition solely to consult the Board&apos;3 Demonstrator.Plant Diseases.Vart Disease.   Extensive propaganda work has been carried outin the Eastern and. southern Counties of England,, and a large numberof posters have been exhibited, and, as a result, cases of diseasehave been reported from many districts hitherto not known to beinfected.       Inspectors have investigated cases as fellows:-   Kent,2;ijurroy \; Oxford 1; Bssex.^Lancashire 5;Bedfordl;Norfolk 1;   and severalin Somerset.     In most cases there was a strong suspicion that the disease was produced as a result,of planting &quot;Arran Chief&quot; seedinfected with Vart Disease, and this spread of Arran Chief seedfrom suspicious districts must receive more attention in the future.The disease seems to be spreading from Lancashire to the&quot;..est Riding of Yorkshire where a number of cases have been dealtwith.     In South Notts new cases have also been recorded.     A verythorough search has been made in      &apos; r - -Hampshire and Wiltshire but so far na further cases have been discovered.Late Blight.     Inspectors in the Northern and Midland districts of England report that most of the potatoes have now been lifted,and that they appear to be free from blight.     The weather conditions have been very good, so that it is not anticipated there will bemuch loss of potatoes in the Clamps this season.The reports from the South &quot;est how that only light cropshave been obtained, and that tubers infected with late blight arecommon.     Arran Chief seems to have given the best results and will again be largely planted in these districts.     Inspectors reportthat some of the immune varieties &quot;have been tried with only moderateresults,     &quot;Great Scott&quot; is said to be a good cropper, and &quot;king george&quot; and &quot;Ally&quot; appear to have cropped well, but &quot;Majestic&quot; onthe other hand has cropped badly and the tubers have been very muchblighted,...American Gooseberry ,Tildew Order of 1919.

Replies have been sent explaining theY/orking of the Board&apos;s egg distribution scheme which was startedduring the war, and suggesting that the applicants communicateeither with the Ctunty Poultry Instructor or the County EggDistribution Station.Letters have been received from poultry keepers pointing /-out the difficulty they have experienced in disposing of surplusoockerels.     They have in each case been informed how they maydispose of their surplus stock.The Board have approached the National Utility poultrySociety, asking whether it v/ould not be possible to circularise themembers of that Society, with a view to their training ex-Servicemen in poultry keeping.     The Society have agreed to insert anappeal in the year Book which will be despatched to all members ifthe Society in December.A meeting of the Egg Advisory Committee was held at theMinistry of Food on the 24th inst.     to discuss the controlledprice ef eggs.     The meeting passed a practically unanimousresolution that the Food Controller should be askei to remove atonce control of egg prices.     Failing the removal of control, themeeting discussed what prices should be fixed, but the Board&apos;proposal that prices of fresh eggs should be raised above thepresent controlled price was not accepted.Live Stock-.Number subsidised     Total New Grants     Number of Newduring year ended    or Renewals since   Grants or Renew-31 March 1919. 1 April 1919.        als approvedduring week.Boars 356 221 5Bulls 728 -465 4Heavy Horses 122 141 NilExport of Stcok.

The circular is now being sent out.The report *n Agricultural Employment during the harvestof 1919 has been prepared from the returns sent in by the farmerste whom the circular was sent, and is &quot;being printed in the wages board Gazette.Agricultural Wages Board.On the 18th October, before the Reose Bench,Haverfordwest, Pembroke, a case was heard against a farmer forunderpayment of 5 workers employed on his farm.     The  &apos;.defendant pleaded guilty.     Immediately before the hearing, hehad paid up arrears to his 5 farm workers.     The Benoh, havingregard to the fact that thiB was the first case in the district,fined the defendant l/- in respect of each case and orderedhim to pay costs, including an advocated fee.At Eglwypwrw, Pembroke, on the 21st October, a farmer wasprosecuted before the Bench for underpayment of workmen employedon his farm.     The Benoh found that an offence had been committedbut dismissed the summonses under powers given them by Section 1(l) of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.     They made no order as to costs.Before the Ashford (Kent) Bench en 21st October, eightsummonses were heard against a farmer for underpayment of threewomen workers employed on his farm.     After evidence had beengiven showing that there had been underpayment in the case of all three werkers, and offences on 4 out of the eight summonses, the defendants solicitor admitted that these offences had been committed and the Bench convicted the defendant on 4 summonses,fined him  2 and costs, dismissed the other 4 summonses, andordered arrears to be paid amounting to 17/8.An appeal by a defendant against the decision of the magistrates at ^shipping, Essex, fining him  25 and ordering him topay arrears of  2. 17. 6. to a worker, was heard on 14th Octoberbefore the Lord Chief Justice, Avory and Sankey JJ sitting aa adivieitnal oourt.     Counsel for the appellant stated that thePoint in issue was whether the Agricultural Wages Board had power to institute proceedings under Section 4 of the corn production 4fi&amp; in respect of a workman who had not made anycemplaint o:Anderpayment.     He argued that;-(l)- An offence under section 4 was in reality an individual   grievance of the workman and not a matter- of publio policy. r He referred to 29 L.J.N.S.P.127.
(2)   Section 7 cf the Act cuts down the general powers to.take proceedings conferred by section 17 of Schedule I(being a eeotien incorporated in the Corn production act by Section 5 thereof from the Trade Boards Act) andin effect limits the Board to take proceedings after a- complaint has been made by a workman, in that workman?s Name.(3) Neither the Board, therefore, nor their officer had any power to initiate proceedings where no such complainthad been made.The respondent wan not called upon.&quot;In his judgment, the Lord Chief Justice, after reading the sections, said in effect, that there could be no question that,standing alone, section 17 of Schedule I gave the Board power to commence proceedings notwithstanding that no complaint had beenreceived.     Furthermore, Section 7 was Introducted not to limitthat power, but to impose on the Board a statutory duty to considerthe complaints of workmen when ma.de:He also said (without deciding the point) that an offence under Section 4 would clearly be a matter of public policy.Avory J.    said that proceedings by information under the corn production*Aot were no exception to the general rule, and information might be by any person.     That the enforcement ofsection 4 was a matter of public policy and not one of individualgrievance was a necessary inference from the fact that a workman1sassent or dissent was immaterial to the commencement of proceedings and referred to section 4 (3).Sankey J.   ooncurred.The appeal was dismissed with costs.During the week 69 cases of complaint of non-payment cfthe minimum rates were received, the highest number from a singlecounty being 11 in the oast cf Yorkshire,     Eighty-eight cases were sent to Inspectors for visit;    enquiries by correspondence weremade in 121 cases and 85 oases vere completed.

(2).
At the close of tho competition, the nine bestcandidates wore selected to compote for the prizes in tho afternoon.Tho first prize was awarded to a woman now working in Bedfordshirewho has been milking for about two years and who was a shorthand-typist before      entering the Land Army.     The second prize wasawardod to a woman now wording in Surrey, who started farm work 4 years ago, who subsequently joined the Land Army and whose previousoncupat ion was that of a Kitchen maid.Under ordinary circumstances only one third prize wouldhave been awarded, but tho judges stated this competition was thebest that they had had in the Show - there only being six pointsdifference between tho first and eighth candidate; they had,therefore decided to award three third prizes, three fourth prisoand ono fifth prize.The results of this competition were particularly-/ratifying owing to the fact that all the candidates had been trained on different farms, under different people.The difficulties of training in the Land Army have beenvery great.   The recruits were unaccustomed to farm conditions,farmers were often averse from lending their cows for the use ofsuch raw recruits.   Th^t such a high uniform standard should havebeen reached is a very gratifying tribute to the work done by the farmers and instructresses.    It should also be borne in mind thattho counties which supplied these candidates are not usuallytermed &quot;Dairying Counties&quot;.The judges1 final remark on their report was: &quot;a mostexcellent class deserving of high praise&quot;.Animal Diseases.The number of outbreaks of bwine Fever during the weekhas boon 64, and of reports of suspected cases , 101.9 outbreaks of Anthrax have been confirmed against 41reoorts received.1 case oi Rabies has ueen confirmed, namely, atColchester, iissex, and 4 reports of suspected cases have beenreceived.18 outbreaks of Foot-and-lEouth Disease have boonconfirmed during the week, 15&apos; inTne Isle of light, 1 in Hunts.,1 in Cambs., and 1 in Warwickshire.During xhe Statistical wes  ending 25th inst. therehavo been 21 outbreaks of parasitic Ilange, and 22 outbreaks ofSheep Scab notified by Local .iuthorities.[gterinary Laboratory.swine ffever material was examined in 83 reportedoutbreaks;&quot;&quot;in 65 swine fever -as found to exist.

In the case of man-/&apos; worn-out horses which beforethe war went to Holland&amp;Bolg:iurn for slaughter it was sufficient fora Veterinary Inspector to certify true they were capable of beingconveyed and disembarked without cruelty,     Tho position is, now changed and every horse which the Veterinary Inspector is unableto certify as being capable of being worked without sufferingmust remain in this country however suitable it may be for horse-flesh.The promoters of the Export of Horses Act of 1914 may therefore unwittingly have put a premium on the working of unfithorses in this country, unless the vigilance cf the police and ofthe Royal   Society of the Prevent ion of Cruelty to Animals isstimulated and the staff of the R.S .P.C.-.A, considerably increased.So far an oan be judged, tho general (destruction ofRats during the Rat Week will throve to have been considerably greater than was at first anticipated.

During the week theBoard nave been approached by the Ministry of Munitions regardingthe dumping of surplus ammunition, now in the area of the B.E.F.France.     This ammunition has to be shipped out of the follcwingports:   Le Treport, Dieppe, Boulogne and Punic irk;     A site of awreck at a considerable distance from the French coast has been selected, in 20 fathoms of water, which could be used as adumping ground for Le Treport, Dieppe and Boulogne, and, inthe case of Dunkirk, the Board have asked the Ministry of munitions to select a deep hollow, krown as West pit, a considerable distance off the Mouth of the Scheldt, which is the only possibleposition that is not likely to affeot British fishing interests.Incidentally, this site was selected in the case of certainammunition lying at Antwerp,     A difficulty has,however, arisen in this connection, owing to the skipper of one of the dumping,barges not carrying out his instructions, rand releasing his oargotwo miles off the Dutch coast, thereby oausing danger to theDutoh fishermen who trawl in this area.     If he had dumped in theWest Pit, as instructed, no question would have arisen, as thereis already a wreck in the vicinity, and this alone would have hadthe effeot of deterring the fishermen from fishing near that place.Scarcity of Fishermen at Hull.   A representative of theDepartment attended a Conference at the Admiralty, when aDeputation from the Hull Trawler Owners Association was received with regard to a proposal for employing, in fishing operations, menabout to be demobilised frvm the Royal Navy.
