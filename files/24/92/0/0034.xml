TSLfiPHOHE SERVICE.Deputation from the National Union of ManufacturersOctober 16th 1915.POSTliASTEi^-GENERAL&apos; S REPLY.
TEE Posmsm-OTIEAL: (in reply):    Col. Sir FrederickHall and Gentlemen.    I an very pleased that you have come here became I think a talk like this will do a good dealof good.    From lots of things I can sec you have not theopportunity of understanding1 the position which I shaJl bevery pleased to explain to you.    This Deputation has been delayed a considerable time.    When you first mentioned itI was undergoing a slight operation which delayed things fora while,    I then fixed a day for August 6th which did not materialise somehowv    I then fixed a time for the 2ndOctober and then sf course came the Railway Strike which upsetthat arrangement, we were all too busy with other things to receive Deputations.    Now I am very glad at the thirdattempt it has come off. .Perhaps I had better first explain the situation toyou, Gentlemen, and what has led up to it.    As far as40 yea-rL ago, which Sir Frederick was referring to   ofcourse I cm not responsible for it or anybody.else in thePovst 0i fIce now, v-m are rather, if I may say so, perhaps,the victims of it and we ought to have your sympathy - theNational telephone Company as you know had the license givento it arid fev working under a terminable license.    Of course that is ail very well for the shareholders in a way, theydid not suffer so much, but the general public did.    Thelicence expired on December 31, 1911, and an Arbitrationtook place to &apos;.fix the purchase price, as you all know.I think we are all business men here, myself included, who-would sav tUev themselves  would have pursued the samepolicy, that is wj-en the Company saw that the whole of their assets were to be taken over by somebody else they were not going tc keep &quot;laying^out money to the very last moment whenit was to be taken ever and they cannot be blamed for it;consequently
consequently^ there was no incentive to them to sink anycapital in the concern and when the thing was taken over,they had arranged their affairs so very well that practicallythere was no spare plant left at all,    The Government took over a service which as everyone teams     I bid a good deal to &quot;do wit)i tho agitation myself a few years before !,hat -was not hy any means satisfactory, it could have been varymuch bobber, but as I say, for business reasons, the Companydid nob lay out capital.    The Arbitration wad delayed sometime, bub the Post Office took the &quot;Service.:over in 1912.They began to lay out money and during the years 1912-13,19:13-14, a sum of about  1,350,000 was laid out per year.    Then the War broke out and when the War went on fora considerable time for the rest of the period of the war from early in 1915 up to March of this year on account of shortage of material, shortage of men and so on, there wasonly an average of  280,000 a year spent on maintaining thesystem.    There was practically no extension except - for urgent War work and for Government Departments,The cases that have been referred to by Mr. Wrightand others I will inquire into.    There is, I may say,a very great shortage of these switchboards and there hasbeen ail along:   they have not been made because there isnobody to make them, but I will inquire into that and go wellinto it.    As soon as the Armistice was signed, we wentintothe question very carefully and drew up a programme for thisyear - I am talking of the financial year, the O-overrm^ntyear that ends on the cist Varch and for this year ^e havedra^n up a programme in which we intend to lay out  3,000,000sterling on new Exchange s,j improving the lines, putting inextra lines, extra switchboards and generally getting a beginning - it is only a beginning - in getting the Serviceinto
&apos;.. fjo a more satisfactory ^oriditioru    I should explain that we should be quite willing and in fact we are anxious to do-more than this but it is impossible;  thereis such a- shortage of&quot;material and auch a shortage of labourand transport, as you all know all your,, businesses are affected in the sane way, you have and will suffer more orliss in the same way:  when you want, anything, you do not-now when you will get it or it is very much delayed - hadwe been able to expend more money, we should have been veryr) .:p 4ed to do so&apos;and have had a more extended programme.I vrill tell you what the programme is shortly.    Ofcourse a building takes a considerable time more especiallynow to put up, but where it is very urgent indeed and wherea building; win take a very long time to put up, we are going to arrange to have temporary -accommodation ^o thatsome relief can he afforded while a proper and suitablebuilding is being1 put up and will be fully equipped later on.    That is only part of our difficulties.    There are many others.    One is the shortage and experience of staff.In 1914 there was only 4 per cent, of the operators who hadless than six months1 experience.    Recently the averagehas been over 25 per cent, and in one of the Exchanges&apos;there was 41 per cent, with less than six months1 experience.Then over 1,000 trained operators during the War were taken away to go to various Government establishments, privateexchanges, Naval and Military places all over, and though we have had a few of these returned, there are still nearly800 of these highly skilled operators working in the; various government Departments whom we cannot get back.    We should like to have them and we hope that something will&apos;be arranged by which the Departments will be able to liberate at least some of them.    It takes six months1 training for them even to be of moderate use and to be of full efficiency it takessomething
something like 18 months to 2 years.    So that you see therethat.is a difficulty we are up against and which we arehoping to overcome..   It has been said by various people whomake complaints that the shortage is due to our not payingsufficient wages.,   Well. I do not think that is so, becausethose girls of&apos; 18 years of. ago who- before the %r were receiving 16/- a week at the beginning and rose up to 28/-are now starting at 37/10 a week rising up to 58/2.    Thegreatest care is being exercised to get the very heat materialpossible and I think that only something like 10 per cent, ofthose who present themselves are taken.    We want to getwhen we are getting them the very best people we can and whowill be likely to stay and become part of the permanent staff.Recruiting is improving, though it has been made more difficult by the way in which the telephone operators are abused by thePress.    They read a newspaper and naturally they say &quot;Hereare all these unjust charges made against us, that we areknitting, sewing, reading and all that, having tea andindulging in conversation instead of attending: to the work,we will go somehwere else, we are not going to be ridiculedby these people.&quot;    But in spite of all that, it is improving.The traffic of course has increased enormously.    Before theArmistice the calls in London were rather under a million per day.    Nor they are fully a million and a quarter, ratherover that and there is not much more material for it to goover.    The consequence is that getting such an enormousnumber of people using the telephone probably some ef themmany tines during the day, that is to say at any rate some-1 million of people, there is bound to be an opportunityof somebody being annoyed every day.    It is a big figure and -ome of them make more of it than,they are really justifiedin doing, I think. /New,
Now, Sir Frederick Hall,-referring to-the question about your^friend who could not get put&apos; on.    We knowperfectly well that what we are suffering from is theshortage of wires, cables, trunks and exchange boards aswell as the personnel.    As I say, the service was handedover in 1912 practically bare.    Then the Post Office beganfor three years ^getting things straight and then we havehad a period of five years when we have been absolutelydoing nothing at all, except as I say for War work.    We are all that in arrear but as I said, when I come further on tothe point, I will tell you  what we are doing in that wayto make good the deficit.    I may say here that some peoplesay that since the Post Office took over the trunk lines,they have done nothing at all, and that the National TelephoneCompany did.marvels.    In the 12 years that the NationalTelephone Company had charge of the trunks they put in29,000 miles of trunk wire. .   In the23 year3 the PostOffice have had it they have put in some 420,000 miles,whichwith the extensions going on will make it over 500,000 miles.As I say not having sufficient wires, cables, trunks, boards and operators, there is delay, overloading:, confusion andthere is bound to be.    It is Just like the Embankment wason the Monday morning of the Strike.    I came down there andit was all jammed up with traffic and I could not *move;   inordinary times you come dam in a motor quite freely.    Itis just the same with this extra traffic over the wires:there is not sufficient room, there is the great pressure of several messages waiting to go over one line when they ought to have two or three to accommodate the traffic&quot;satisfactorily.    Of course at busy tir:es of the dayeverybody gets to a certain extent tied up,    Th? remedy oofcourse
course for that is perfectly obvious and it is what we are doing, that is have increased accommodation, increased wires,increased cables, increased trunks, increased exchanges andswitchboards and a larger staff to deal with them so thatthey can all just have a comfortable amount of calls to dealwith and have no delay. &apos; That is the obvious thing to do.Of course at present there is no room on the boards or any-thing else.As you represent Manufacturers from all parts of thecountry I will tell you first what we are doing in thecountry.    I my &quot;say in London since the Armistice, we have put in 14,000 lines in London alone and at present we are doing 400 a week.COL. SIR FHSD HALL:   Might I ask a question on that.   InJuly in the House you said you were going to put do^i newcables.    Might I ask you while on that- point what new cableshave been laid down since then?THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   They are all in work.COL: SIR TOD HALL:   You say new cables,THE POSTMASTER GE1ETAAL:   You cannot dig 50 or 100 miles of trench to put them in and get the cables manufacturedready and delivered Immediately:   they are all going on;We are putting underground wires in 20 large towns so thatthere will not be breakdowns from storms and so on:  Perth,Duiifermline, Saltbura, Lincoln, Grimsby, Dewsbury, Ashton-made r-Lyne, Socles, Accrington, Stroud, Newcastle-under-Lyne(Staffordshire), Malvem, Cardiff, Porth, Tonypandy, Mansfield,Nottingham, Chesterfield, Market Harborough, Sheffield,Shrewsbury, Norwich, Aldershot and a number of smaller places.A new Exchange has  been opened, I think some months ago, miRuddersfieId which is working very satisfactorily and improvesthe service very much indeed.   New switchboard: Central,Exchange at Liverpool and an extension cf the Bank Exchangeat
at Liverpool, Derby and Leeds.    Then there are five newExchanges being put up at Carlisle, West Bromwich, Milnsbiidge,Hortbaniiton and aui3dford..-   I do not know whether these have all started building but Reparations are being made and theyare going on with them.,.Then there are Exchanges being extended,, switchboardsand apparatus at Lincoln, Cambridge, Birmingham North andHove.Then again there are new Exchanges also being built at Grantham, Henley-en-Thames, Stratford-onWtvon., Lancaster,Southport, Northampton,&apos;Preston and Whit.! ey Bay (Northumberland)The Exchanges, where there can be additions made to thgn,that is  where there is sufficient room, are being extendedat Dublin, Swansea, Burnley,&quot;Dundee, Canterbury, ^leetwcodand Wigan.-Then there are underground new trunk lines from london to Manchester, passing Northampton, Leicester, Loughboroughand Derby; Derby to Nottingham, and a new cable from Derbyto Sheffield and Leeds.Of course that is a biggish programme.    Then we arelaying new cables (this one is almost finished):   Liverpoolto Manchester,    Then Liverpool to Chester, Leeds to Wake field,Manchester to Bolton, Manchester to Rochdale, Glasgow toMotherwell;  then London to Staniaore and it will connectup various routes Luton, Watford, St.Alban3 and various other places.Then there are London to Bristol, London and Southampton,Louehborough and Nottingham, Derby and Nottingham, Hull andQrimsby, Leeds and Harrogate, Leeds and York and paisleyand Greeiiock.I am afraid I am giving you a rather long list, but/I nant you to see that we are not quite so sleepy as we look.COL:
vOT: SIR TO5D HALL:   I ma very glad to hear the work isbeing proved on.    We had this information in July in theHouse: you -very kindly gave it then,THE K)smST3V^RAl:   Which, however, was notreported it was carefully kept out r,f the papers,    It was rather too much to expect the Press to publish a debate in theHouse giving all this list of names, naturally they were pressed for space and it did not get as widely known as Ishould have liked.    Glasgow to Coatbridge;   Coat bridge tcAirdrie; Kotherwell to Hamilton;  Motherwell to Wishaw;Glasgow to Dumbarton;  Grnskirk to Preston; Ormekirk toBacup;   Slough to Windsor and Staines to Tunbridge Wells.Those are going on and it is hoped at any rate they willbe ready within a year from new.    It is hoped so;   I will   -not give any guarant.ee they will.    Everybody knows, especiallyanyone hero in the Engineering trade - I always say thatthe Engineering trade has a special calendar of its own - theyhave difficulties beyond their control, strikes, gettingmaterial and so on which delays them, but we are hoping&apos; to get it done,Trnt we are doing in London in the way of Exchanges is this:   there is Clerkenwell Exchange which we hoped to openin December which will accommodate 1,700 lines, but it willbe open I think in January,    Then thero are Bishcpsgate,Tower, Ho lb cm, Strand* SI cane Square and Mary leb one.  Thoseare new Exchanges some of which have been begun, seme havenet been begun, but they are all going to be pressed on as quickly as possible as far as building material and labour are available. /Then Extensions are being made at the Avenue exchange and a temporary one at Clerkenwell as I said before,Chingford, Hampstead, Harrow, Hornsey, Battersoa Park,    /Stratford, Tottenham, Victoria and Waitham Cross.    Thosewill
...       2G3will be opened except, two before &apos; next June, most af them inJanuary. February and March;  two of&quot; them in Sept-ember,   &apos;; &quot;&quot;Harrow and Victoria.COL: SIR FRED HALL:   I do not see anything in the southof London.    Are there any improvements in the South ofLondon?  Perhaps that win be looked into.MR. MLZELL:   The southern exchanges are not full.COL. SIR FRED HALL:   They are very unsatisfactory inmany oases,MR. NEWPON XNIGETS:   You mentioned the Tower, Sir.   Iwas turned out of my offices IB months before the War tobuild the Tower Telephone Exchange that was going to beput up and not one stitch has been put in on that propertyever since;   the hoarding has been standing f cr 18 months before the War, the tenants turned out and net a thing done,THE K^mSmirWSmL:   There has been delay duringthe War.MR. MSWTON KNIOETS:   A year has gone by since thetermination of the.War and not a stone touched,TEE FOS^ASTO-^NEIBAIi:   I will forward your remarks tothe Postmaster-General of the day. I am not responsiblefor that. Tenders are now in for the Tower Exchange andthey are going to begin building immediately.I see there is a point of yours I ought to have referred- to but which I am afraid I overlooked, that is about the installation charge.    As you said, I said in the House thatwhen it meets again In the autumn I am going to ask for a select Committee to go into the whole question ef charges.It is all being run at a loss, because we.have not passed onto the public what we Lave had to pay out in extra&apos; expenses in all sections of the Pest Office and this 54 is a thing to help on for a bit, for the time being, but it will come up for discussion when the Select Committee is appointed whenthey
they will  0 into the whole question of the financial part and see what they have got to recommend.COL: SIP FRED HALL:   I suppose that will not be debitedto any would-be subscribers who apply for installationprevious to the  4 having been actually placed on?THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   It is in the nature of a sur-cbarge    it is a reduction, not an increase.    You rubbed itin pretty well at the tine, your friend as far as I rememberwas charged  276.&apos;COL: SIR FRED call:    277.THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   I am a pound wrong.    He came inat  4.,COL: SIR FRED HALL:   At the present time I will notquarrel about a - pound1 -MR., TOJTON,KUICjETS: - I think the point is this:   I am justleaving one house to move into another;   the lady coming intomy present house who wants to take over the existing telephonehas to pay  4 as an installation fee when the telephone isalready there. -THE POSTMASTER Cffi]general :   I find in this world you donot get much for nothing, you have to pay and if you do not pay in meal you have to pay in malt I - one way or the other.The whole question of charges is exceedingly complicatedthat I felt I must have somebody in from outside to go into it and I hope I shall be able,to satisfy people.I now come to1 this demand for a small Committee of&apos; Business men to assist in reorganizing the telephone system and so on. &apos; One Committee to. deal with that subject wouldbe kept working night and day for a Very long time.    Theywould have probaizly to travel up and down the country and find a lot of work that would be really more than &quot;one committee could possibly deal with. &apos; You may not know it, but thereare fifty Committees&apos; of husiness men already in existence ,up
up and doi!7n the Oountry,   I do not want you to listen tothe names of SO large towns., and -districts, but I have alist somewhere.COL: SIR FRED HALL:   On that very subject.THE KJsmsra^G^ Here is the list,COLD: SIR FRED HALL:   Are they sitting on that -verysubject?THE ?0^smHmmhL.   Yes.MR. DAL2SLL:  Telegraph and Telephone AcHsory Committees..THE P0STMAS&apos;1JMHI?^RAL:  Yes, these Committees arealready in existence and they are all very representative.I might perhaps give you two large places.    If you takeBradford, the Corporation has three members, the Chamber efCommerce three, the Chamber of Trade two, Keighley Chamber.Taking Glasgow, the Chamber of Commerce 7, Corporation Zand 14 other members, representing steamship owners,shipbuilders, engineers, coalmasters and all the varioustrades.MR, CAULFIFLD:   Is there one for London?THE POSW^TEIMmRAL:   Yea, certainly.   The&apos;public aroasked to lay any complaints and any suggestions they have tomake before these Committees and I have given instructions that any information they want is to be given to them, thatthe District Managers and superintending engineers or anyother officials can go and attend their meetings and dealwith these cases, they can inspect the Exchanges or the plantor anything - have a free run of the whole of the system mieverything put at their disposal in order to try and improvethings. /MR. R. S. WRIGHT:   Has the customer been told that hecan apply to these Committees?THE POSTMASTER general :   Yes. / -MR. R. S. WRIGHT:   In the Press?MR, CAHL^IELD:  As Mr. Jones told you, he put thisarticle
article before you and he was practically turned down.I do not see how that can have been before any Committee.TEE POSTMASTETHiElCEbyjt   Ee did net take it to aCommittee.   I do not know whether I have the constitutionof the London Committee.    There are representatives ofthe Chamber of Commerce, the Corporation of London and theLondon County Council.    Those are the three Bodies.  Thatis a very good assurance that all reasonable things willbe  inquired into and everything done to remedy defects.However, I have heard what you have said.    I do not wishto give a definite reply one way or the other t-o-day.   i will consider it and communicate with you later after consideration.    There are 50 Committees&apos;and it would m-mean 51.    I-do not know whether that is a very great point.I win consider it.    We are always anxious to get information or advice as long as it is helpful.    With tha.t obieet inview I arranged last January to send sow of our expert *over to America to look into their system there which theyhad done before, and some of the Americans, I believe, are over here now looking into our system to see whether theycan adopt anything or improve their system in Hew York.    Iarranged for them to leave in May, but the time then was notfavourable for them and they asked to put it off and some ofthem went last week and ^ome of them I believe are going next week and then they win come baclc and compare notes and see ifthere is anything to adopt.    The Americans have come here -as I say some are over here now and they will go back and see whether there is anything they can pic1-&apos; out of 1 our system that win  he&apos;, a help to them.    ?he Companies there have beenvery good, we exchange full information with one another andany fresh information is* open m both ddes of the Atlanticto both people.
I think I havo shown you fairly wall that what withthis probiom of tho terminable license that the nationalTelephone Company wan working under and tho conditions sincethe Post Office took it over really the telephone has net hadthe opportunity that it has had in other countrior:    it hasnot had a proper opportunity at all,    fthero there has beena National system or a private system in other countries theyhave had a straight run.:   the private owners:, $now that it is going to remain their property and they have been able todevelop it fully without fear of somebody pouncing upon themand talcing it away,,    That is what happened to the nationalTelephone Company and added to that these unfortunate fiveyears in which wo have had to stand still, with (he trafficincreasing all the time, has brought ibings to the present pass,You will all agree I think as reasons!be men that five years &apos;arrears of work is a big Ice way to males up.    It cannot all be done in a year.    We cannot dig all those hundreds ofmiles of trenches and get hundreds of miles of cables laid allat once.    Vfc arc pressing on as hard as we can and will evontuI&apos; am absolutely certain arrive at a telephone system by far themost efficient in the world, the same as our Postal serviceand the telegraph in spile of the few complaints which you have brought as to the Telegraph.COL. SIR FEED HALL:   I hope you will take that only as a sample.    Vo did not wish to bring them all.    Unfortunatelythere are hundreds and hundreds. iTHE POSTVASTIE GENERAL:    It is admitted by everybody to bthe best in the world.    These are matters to be regretted, butI am sure in your own business you have people making Mistakesoccasionally which they should not do.    We have not got toabsolute perfection yet:   when wo do, I think it will bo avery dull world! &apos; / -&apos;      Mr.
I think I havo shown you fairly wall that what vrlthtils problem of the terminable license that tho nationalTelephone Conpany was working under and tho conditions sincetho Post Office took it over really the telephone has net had* the opportunity tliat it haa had in other countries:    it hasrot had a proper opportunity at all,    Where there has beena Na.tioh.aI system or a private system in other countries theyLc-.7c had a straight rue:   the private owners.&apos;.know that it is going *0 remain their property and they have been able todevelop it fully without fear of somebody pouncing upon themand taking it&apos;away,,    That is what happened to the nationalTelephone Company and added to that these unfortunate fiveyearn in which wo have had to stand still, with the trafficincreasing all the time, has brought iiings to the present pass,You will all agree I think as reasonalbe men that five years1 &apos;arrears of work is a big lee way to make up.

MR, CAUIjDriEED:   and probably a new ono! -THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   There are millions of telegramsdealt with, of course.    I think from what I have told you and what I have shown in the programme you will recognisethat everything is being done that reasonably can be expectedto bo done to improve the service.    As I say, I am quite sure in the course of time it will bo by far the best service in the world.    I will have inquiry mode into the telegraphcomplaints,    I did not know you were going to bring them up or I should have had som3 information.- COL. SIR 3ftED HALL:    You have been so explicit that Ihesitate to encroach on your time, but might I ask one or two questions arising out of that?THE POSTHASTES GENERAL:    Yjs.COL. SIR PR ED HALL:    First of all, you referred to the3 millions of money to bo oxpended.    May 1 ask is that to boexpended between now and the beginning of next year?THE PGSTMASTi^ GENERAL:    No, the financial year, 1stApril to the 31st March,COL. SIR ERED HAIL:    The fiiiahcial .year 1919-20?THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   Yes/COL, SIR EBED HALL:   That is actually to be expended?   -THE P0STi,L\ST3iTi GENERAL: Trovidod there are not Strikes!COn, SIR 7R3D HALL:   Surely.THE P0ST1IASTER CENTAL:   Thai is the programme.COL. SIR PRED HALL:   You did not refer to that case;of the trunk call of 3 miles between such places as Shipley bridge and Rodhill referred to by my honourable friend. fTHE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   I ought to refer to that.&apos;   Ihave a note of it.    Those matters will come before the SelectCommittee.    It is a question of boundaries.  You have to havea boundary somewhere, the same as with Income Tax.COL.
COL. SIP. FEED HALL:  Kay I press that something may bo donein order that these purely local calls, practically betweenore village and another, shall not be sent to London and thenback again because it is easy enough for thorn by a littlemechanism to arrange for that.Then with regard to the expenditure of this 3 millions and subsequent sums, is it intended that the telephone systemshall become dearer or will it become cheaper?    Anji only one other point:   recognising as I m sure you do, Sir, theimportance of tho Association from which I have had. tho honour of introducing the Deputation today, night I suggest that you would anl: the Association to so loot cue of its members to sit on,cay, the CoLr.ittec that is dealing with the London Telephonesystem?    Might I venture to suggest that, Sir?THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   I will consider that point.With regard to the proposed expenditure making the telephonesystem cheaper or dearer, I have been considering the desirabilityof passing tho extra charges, as everybody in business does,on to the consumer.    Take gas for instance, which was 2/-*, nowit is charged to the public at anywhere between 4/- and 5/-, Ibelieve - most of it is 4/3.    We have thought at any rate thatfor the present while trade is in a sort of transition state,it would be more desirable to keep up communications as cheaplyas possible.    As it is now the Post Office is being subsidisedby the Treasury in order to keep going.   Things change so rapidlyit is difficult to say what the loss will be, but when wo; looked at it, it looked as if this year it would be 2 millions: - itwould not ho loss anyway,    As I say, it will be for the selectCc.aiittee to settle all this very complicated question of telephone charges:    they will go into it and advise what to do.As I said before, everybody knows in their own business - i know in my businesses - that wages which are being paid are/nearly three tines what they were before the War and the output is
in less through tho shortor hours,    Sic extra charge applies ailround;   it is not peculiar to tho Post Office.    We are notmagicians who can produce something out of nothing.    However,that is the position as it is at present.    The variouscomplaints I will go into.    With all the millions and millions of calls that are made, when I am suddenly confronted with onecomplaint, I cannot he expected to deal with it immediately.COL. SIP FRED HALL:   Surely,   Perhaps you will be goodenough to look into it,THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   I will inquire into it,COD. SIR 1TRHD HAIL:  Will you communicates with us?THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   Certainly.COL. SIR FEED HALL!   Thank you, Sir,Mr. GODFREY CHESSMAN;   I was informed that the wire fromthe receiver to the instrument was made abroad and was notproduced in England at all although it could be and that thatwas responsible for a great deal of the delay and also that the instruments themselves are made by various firms one in one part and another in another.SIR A.M. OGILVIE:   The instruments are all standardised.Mr. GODFREY CEEESi&amp;H:   I had a definite statement made tome:   it was said it was entirely foreign wire.    I was informedit was made entirely in Trance.SIR A.H. OGILVIE1   I do not think so.THE POSTMASTER GENERAL:   That is quite a mistake.COL. SIR FRED HAIL:  I am sure, Mr. Illingworth, we.&apos;areexceedingly grateful to you for having accorded us this interview,which has been I am afraid, a long one, this morning.    we appreciate the difficulties that you have to contend with, butwe do venture to hope that at all events tho views of therepresentatives of such an important Body who have had the honour of waiting upon you this morning will give an impetus to theDepartment in seeing whether something cannot bo done to improve the
the system.  We recognise to the full tho difficulties thatyou have, but we do think, as has been referred to, that ayear after the Armistice, we ought to find ourselves with abettor system than we have.    We look forward to it.    Wo tenderto you our very best thanks for the full manner in which you have gone into the matter and if for instance you cannot seeyour way to fall in entirely with the Resolution that waspassed at tho Cannon Street Hotel - you have promised to give ityour due cons id oration. - I do venture to press that one of themembers of the Association, should be invited to Join the LondonCommittee.    Onee more on behalf of the Deputation I thank youcordially for your kind reception.THE P0ST1/ASTER GENERAL:    I am very pleased to see you,but I must point out to you that you cannot expect five years1arrears to bo overt alien in eleven months when tho country hasbeen so disturbed.    It is not reasonable to expect it and Iam sure really you do not, but we are doing cor best.    I maysay that although we got a certain amount of abuse, we get acertain amount of praise.    I will read you one or two.   here is one:   &quot;Doubtless with all the complaints published inconnection vrith your Service you may be thinking this earth isworse than hell.    Let me say that at about 6.15 p,m. I put acall to Glasgow and before  7 p.m. I had secured a connectionand as a Scotchman I raise my hat to such service&quot;.COL, SIR EEED HALL:   The exception proves the rule!THE P0ST11ASTEE GENERAL:   Here is another one:   , &quot;I havebeen confined&apos;to the house this week and hal to attend to business and other matters over the telephone.    During the morning I have been speaking without interval, either being called up aid calling up.    Throughout the service was so quickthat I cannot refrain from giving it a word of appreciation whichI do by these few lines and tendering my thanks to the operatorsin charge&quot;.   V:e have heaps of that sort of thing,   Vic have, I
am glad to-say, a little bright side to our dull life,COL. SIR FRED HALL:  I am sure-you-do not -think we areunreasonable.THE &quot;POSTMASTER -GENERAL: ..Not at all.
