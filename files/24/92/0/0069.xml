The Future or Industrial Councils.Apart altogether from the growth in organisation among employers and employed as separate parties in industry, there has recently been a strong movement in the direc-tion of the organisation of the relationship between these two parties. This is a naturalmovement, since both sides agree that the present state of this relation is unsatisfactory.But this new unity gives new powers, and there has yet been little consideration,much less agreement, as to the use to which they should be put.The Government took immediate cognisance of this tendency, and adopted thepolicy of promoting it by assisting the formation of Joint Industrial Councils for theseveral trades; and the idea of a National Joint Industrial Council for all trades hasbeen accepted by the Government, and has been endorsed and even welcomed by public opinion.   It is here that one may see more clearly than in the sectional councils(0 1913 ) 255  11/19  h&amp;s 3 JJ
the eventual goal towards which the organisation of the relations between employersand workpeople appears to be tending. The authority of such a National Council wouldvary simply with the completeness of representation achieved, and if it represented all theparties in industry it would presumably be supreme in the industrial sphere. It wouldbe the natural source of any regulations in regard to hours, wages and conditions, and its decisions, if it could reach decisions, might conceivably need no confirmation by anyother authority, since the parties represented might have a sufficient power of enforce-ment. In this event a Court of Arbitration such as is at present contemplated i.e.,without powers of legal enforcement of its awards would be related to the supreme council in the same way as the judiciary is to Parliament in the political sphere. Offendersagainst agreements or awards would be excluded from the benefits accruing to membersof the organisations they represented.This is of course not essentially new. Agreements in regard to wages and working conditions now cover the major part of the more important industries of the country, and the parties concerned do not look to the State for any support in enforcing them. The problem of sanctions is therefore one which has confrontedthe stronger organisations on both sides on many occasions, with the result thatthey have evolved a policy of self-reliance in regard to it, and this policy is now of acute importance in connection with the Bill to extend the Wages (Temporary Regulation)Act. The problem of making agreements mandatory has, of course, been vieweddifferently hy different kinds of trade union and employers&apos; organisations. Where tradeunionism feels itself sufficiently strong there is opposition, as has recently been seen,to the State&apos;s being called upon to enforce agreements. This was the line, also, taken bythe Trade Union representatives on the Committee appointed by the Ministry of Recon-struction to consider this matter. It is felt that so far as workers look to the State forthe security of their agreements, it will weaken their own organisations ; and in so faras the State has any power in the matter, it may. hamper that organisation^ policy. Asimilar state of affairs exists on the employers&apos; side. A strong body of employers similarlycan use all kinds of trade pressure to compel refractory units to fall into line. cases have been encountered recently where associations were using the workpeople&apos;s organisa-tions as their instrument for applying this pressure. In the course of the evidence given before the Committee on Trusts, it was ascertained that the majority would not welcomeany legal regularisation of their status. The employers again in highly organised trades,such as mining and engineering, are notoriously opposed to State interference, preferringto depend upon their own power. Thus it conies about that the only bodies desiring theState enforcement of agreements or awards are precisely those which do not fully representthe industries in which they exist. The need for State enforcement in these less well organised trades is, however, very evident.The main result which seems likely to arise from the organisation of the relationsgoverning employers and workpeople is that the parties in industry will obtain a large measure of self-government in purely industrial affairs. If this occurs, as was pointedout last week, it is not necessary to conclude that Parliament will be thereby weakened asregards its essential functions. The province of Parliament and of the Government inregard to industry would be to secure that minimum of industrial conditions on whichcompetent citizenship depends, and to stand for the maintenance during any industrial dispute for orderly government and common life. On the other hand, the placing of full responsibility upon another institution such as a National Industrial Council would makeit less likely that the supreme Government would be regarded in any dispute as aprejudiced party. It does not seem unlikely indeed that public opinion, on whicheventually rests the organisation of society, would welcome the establishment of a principle which would prevent the loss of the prestige of Parliament, while making it more certain that the government of the country would not be held up by sudden andunforeseen disputes.Part II. Departmental.The Problem of Apprenticeship.In this Report for the week ending the 3rd September, attention was drawn to theevidence accumulating in the hands of the Training Department and the Juvenile Branchas to the shortage of apprentices in a number of industries in many localities, and theneed for the investigation of workshop training. This evidence may now be supplemented by information received subsequently by these departments, which is in general of a very similar character.
(C 1913)3H2In the engineering industry, it would appear that the shortage of apprentices is, onthe whole, more marked in the heavier than in the lighter branches of the trade. AtBootle, where it is reported that apprentices are forthcoming in sufficient quantities for thelighter branches, there are complaints of a serious shortage in blacksmitking, copper-smithing, and moulding, which is attributed as elsewhere to the disagreeable nature ofthe work, bad workshop conditions, lack of proper workshop training, the length of theapprenticeship period, and low apprentice wages as compared with those paid to unskilled labour. At Gateshead, however, where large discharges have taken place from munition factories and Admiralty shipyards, engineering apprentices are now forthcoming in sufficient quantities for all branches of the industry. Complaints have been received from Bradfordas to the difficulty of obtaining apprentice moulders on account of the dirty nature of thework and the, effect of the high wages earned on munition work. From Warrington, ashortage of apprentices is also reported in ironfounding and blacksmithing, and firms inthe Pembroke Dock area report to a similar effect as regards apprentice blacksmiths.In Bradford, difficulty has been experienced in obtaining apprentices for boilermakers asthe wages paid compare unfavourably with those in the textile mills, and the boilermakerearns considerably less than shipbuilding platers and riveters whose work demands lessskill. A firm of sheet-metal workers in Birmingham have informed the department thatthere would appear to be no apprentices in training as first-class sheet-metal workers, andthat in five years&apos; time the outlook will be serious. In this case, however, the develop-ment of.mechanical processes is proceeding rapidly, and the need for highly skilled menmay possibly be felt only in connection with the more complicated work.In the building trades, difficulty has been reported in obtaining apprentice joinersin the Glasgow district, and complaints have been received that apprentices already inthe industry have been induced to leave their employers to enter the shipyards. Theattention of the Scottish Employment Council was directed to the shortage in these trades in the Ayr district, where the apprentice rates for joiners were much lower than in Edin-burgh or Falkirk. In the Hamilton district the competition of the coal mines is stated tobe seriously diminishing the supply of apprentice masons in spite of largely increased wages. In Sutton Coldfield, a shortage of apprentices is reported by the Midland Federationof Building Employers, while those available are stated to be demanding very high rates ofwages. This scarcity in the building trade would appear to be prevalent throughout theWest Midlands area, and is attributed in part to the fact that the apprentices accepted areof a superior class, and a high standard is demanded. Other centres from which difficulties have been reported in this industry are Bootle, where the shortage is chiefly felt in thepainting and plumbing branches ; North Shields, where lads are said to be attracted by thehigh wages paid to shipyard labourers ; and the Merthyr area, where the main cause isstated to be the prolonged cessation of building activities.Keports have also been received which indicate a shortage of apprentice wheelwrightsin the Liverpool and Nottingham areas, of apprentice coopers in the Bradford and Bootledistricts, of bobbin-makers at Bradford, where an initial wage of  1 a week has been offered,and of frame makers and gilders throughout the country, The position in this last-namedtrade is reported to be very serious. The wages paid compare unfavourably with those for unskilled labour, and the training given to the boys is reported to be purely sectionalin order that the apprentice may quickly produce on a scale which covers the wages paid.In the Scottish leather trade, a shortage of apprentices dating from before the war stillpersists. Several firms of curriers, leather merchants, and leather goods manufacturershad no apprentices even before the war. The plea put forward by one of these firmsis that the market has been monopolised by German goods and that their work is so easilyspoilt that only skilled men can produce without serious waste. In the North-WesternDivision, attention has been drawn to the reduction of the number of applicants in the printing, tailoring, and saddlery trades, in consequence of the high wages paid to juvenilesin cotton mills. The secretary of the Lancashire and District Master Saddlers&apos; Associationstates that he knows only of three cases in Lancashire and Cheshire where master saddlersare employing apprentices other than their own sons. The future of the trade in this area is considered to be doubtful owing to the great increase in the use of motor transport.In the pottery industry, both in Staffordshire and Yorkshire, the competition of thecoal mines is preventing even pottery apprentices who were taken into the Forces fromreturning to their old occupation. It is stated that in the Castleford district the shortageof apprentices is now so acute that recourse is being had to women&apos;s labour even in the kilnsand ovens, and to an increased use of machinery resulting in the gradual disuse of thepotter&apos;s wheel.Independent action continues to be taken in a number of ways to attract apprentices and improve their training. In the Derby district and in North-East Lancashire, increased
wage scales have been instituted by building trade employers to meet the shortage, andin the former district arrangements have also been made for attendance at a technicalschool at the employers&apos; expense. In the West Midlands, the whole question of apprentice-ship in the building trades is under consideration by the Midland Federation of BuildingTrades Employers. At Newport (Mon.), an interesting apprentices&apos; training schemefor the building trades is under discussion&apos;by a committee representative of employers andtrade unions. This scheme provides that all firms employing skilled men shall be requiredto take and train apprentices in proportionate numbers, and the unions have agreed notto let their members work for employers who do not comply with this regulation. Arrange-ments are to be made for the transfer of apprentices from poorly equipped shops to thosefitted with modern machinery in order to give all-round training. The question of thenumber of apprentices to be allowed still remains to be settled. At Pembroke Dock anattempt is being made to institute apprenticeship in the grocery and baking trades, theperiod in each case to be four years. The general training of apprentice wheelwrights inthe Liverpool district is now under^consideration by the Liverpool, Bootle, and BirkenheadDistrict Master Wheelwrights&apos; Association who are negotiating with the Liverpool CentralTechnical School with a view to the formation of special classes. In Nottingham, theLocal Masters&apos; Association are making inquiries with a view to negotiations with universityauthorities for the institution of technical classes. Individual firms continue to institutespecial training schemes for their apprentices, and in the engineering trade, especiallyin the Sheffield district, there are signs of a general movement for the establishment ofworks schools.At the same time, advocacy of State action continues to be reported from a numberof quarters. A firm of Birkenhead printers have suggested general supervision of thetraining of apprentices by the Ministry of Labour, not only in their own trade but in all others. It may be noted that in Accrington the shortage of apprentices caused by thelow rates hitherto paid in this industry has led to the adoption of the half-time system inorder to compete with the cotton mills for juvenile workers. At Warrington, the branchsecretary of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners complains of theinefficient training received in many workshops by apprentices, and states that the specialfeature appealing to his branch in connection with the Interrupted ApprenticeshipScheme is the power possessed by officers of the Ministry to ascertain at first hand theconditions under which apprentices are trained. At Bootle, representatives both ofemployers and of workpeople have called the attention of the Ministry of Labour to theneed of an immediate survey of the whole question of apprenticeship, and have advocateda system of trade examinations for apprentices, a suggestion which has also been putforward at Warrington.The problem is one in which the Board of Education is interested as regards technicalschool training, while the Ministry of Labour is concerned mainly with workshop training.Discussion of the matter with a number of the Joint Industrial Councils is in hand. TheEducation Committee of the Council for the Vehicle Building Industry recently discussed the question of technical training with representatives of the Board of Education andthe Juvenile Branch, and appointed a sub-committee to consider in detail the wholequestion of juvenile employment. The general question of training in workshops whereinsufficient facilities exist, is now under consideration by the Education Committee ofthe Building Joint Industrial Council.Part IIL-Press Comments.(1) The Labour and Socialist Press.Aliens Bill.The defeat of the Government in the Report Stage of this Bill, and the share theParliamentary Labour Party had in the defeat, attract attention in this week&apos;s papers.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; takes full advantage of the incident. First of all theaction of the Labour Party in contributing to the defeat of the Government is used as aproof of the activity of the Party, and an answer to those critics who have been com-plaining of the uselessness of the Party. The difficulty, however, then arises that theofficial amendment on which the Government was defeated was one with which the labour members thoroughly agreed. This is explained away by reference to the precedingLabour amendments to the Bill which were not accepted by the Government, and the&quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; guesses that the Labour members when they voted were moved by the desire to make an effective protest against the Government^ attitude to their
own amendments and not with any positive feeling of hostility towards French pilots.&quot;While the action of the Labour Party in this matter puzzles the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot;and causes it to enter into so long a discussion, the more strictly IX.P. papers severelycriticise Mr. A damson and his followers for their vote. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; devotesa leading article to the subject, and expresses the opinion that the Labour members morethan any other Party in the House, emerged from the controversy with humiliation anddefeat. It is regretted that Mr. Adamson made a protest against the Labour Party not having been invited to the private conference between the Government and the membersopposed to them. &quot; It would, neither be good Parliamentary tactics, nor would it be politically honest, for the Labour Party to take part in such discreditable bargains.&quot;It is pointed out that the Labour Party, by helping to. defeat the Government, onlysucceeded in making the Aliens Bill more objectionable from the democratic point of view.In &quot; Forward,&quot; &quot; Rob Roy &quot; also censures the Parliamentary Labour Party. &quot; TheGovernment deserves a lesson often enough; then let it be&quot;defeated by the LabourParty on the merits of the question, not for the fun of the thing.&quot; In view of Mr. F. W.Jowetfs long continued specialisation on the subject of Parliamentary procedure, it is somewhat strange that he makes no reference at all to the Government defeat in hisweekly articles to the Bradford and Merthyr &quot; Pioneers.&quot;Finance and High Prices.The financial debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday and Thursday, the29th and 30th October, occurred too late in the week for remarks to be made upon itin the majority of the papers. The proposal to levy a tax upon profits made since thedeclaration of war in 1914 is considered by Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot;He insists that this proposal must in no way be allowed to submerge the agitation for alevy on. all capital, but gives a somewhat qualified, approval to the policy. The&quot; New Age &quot; pays special attention to Lord Milner&apos;s speech in the House of Lords onthe 23rd ult., which it regards as peculiarly important. It arrives at the conclusionthat Lord Milner is in favour of &quot; keeping up prices in order to provide a stimulus forincreased production,&quot; and would oppose any Government attempt to reduce prices.Having thus interpreted Lord Milner, this paper proceeds to outline its continuallyreiterated argument that so long as present methods of production remain, increased production will only increase the prices of the necessaries of life. The &quot; New Age &quot; putstogether its interpretation of Lord Milner&apos;s speech, its own peculiar economic theories,and its opinion that Lord Milner is an especially influential member of the Cabinet, andthus is enabled to arrive at the conclusion that the Government has a definite policy &quot; tokeep the poor poor in order to give them a motive for becoming rich.&quot; The action ofthe M.F.G.B., therefore, in summoning a special conference to consider prices, is approved,but the approval of the &quot; New Age &quot; does not extend to the proceedings of the conference.The only specific reference to the anticipated removal of the bread subsidy is containedin the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; The announcement of the increase proves to Miss E.S. Pankhurst that the only substantial thing the workers have gained by the railway strike is the feeling of self-respect which conies from having unitedly resisted theGovernment. She thinks that the railway strike has taught the Government that abetter way to reduce the proletarian standard of living is to increase prices.National Industrial Council.The future of the proposal to establish this Council is seriously discussed in the &quot; CottonFactory Times.&quot; The subject is of interest to this paper in view of its affection for the1911 Council with which Sir Charles Macara was connected. This journal thinks thatin spite of the refusal of the Government to adopt the full suggestions of the ProvisionalJoint Committee with regard to the Hours of Employment Bill, steps, should be takento set up the new Industrial Council. It regards it as no light accomplishment that therecommendations of the Joint Committee should have been so unanimously and sopromptly agreed upon. Once the Council were definitely formed, this paper thinks that much greater pressure could then be exerted upon the Government of the day with regardto the extension of the scope of the Hours Bill.The Railway Negotiations.The fact that the railway negotiations are now being extended to cover the questionof participation in the control of the Railway Industry by representatives of the men,attracts attention in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; New Age.&quot;In the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; Sir Leo Money devotes an article to emphasizing the significance of this development.  He repeats the Railway Programme he drafted a fortnight ago and .
expresses a desire to see a similar programme formulated for every industry. He wouldbe glad &quot;when the first record was made of a strike hy workers to secure the propereconomic conduct of an industry on behalf of the nation,&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot;comments upon the hostility which is being shown towards &quot; bureaucracy &quot; in the Labourcampaign for the nationalisation of the mines, and in the remarks that have appeared withregard to the nationalisation of the railways, and points out that a similar hostility isshown by the other side. Therefore this paper concludes that an experiment in nationalisa-tion &quot; which seems to offer the chance of eliminating private profit without installing thebureaucrat in place of the profiteer,&quot; should receive considerable public support. The&quot; New Age &quot; warns the railwaymen that they must make sure that the share in control which is offered them is a real share. Unless the railwaymen are admitted to share inthe control of the capital of the Railway Industry, this paper does not think that it willbe of advantage to them to accept the Governments proposals.Workers&apos; Guards.The proposal to enrol throughout the country Citizen Guards continues to arousecomment in the more extreme papers. Mr. F. Willis in &quot; The Call &quot; outlines the proposalfor a Workers&apos; Guard and suggests that the ex-Service men in the trade union ranks willbe able to teach the new Workers&apos; Guard how to be disciplined and that the police strikerswill be able to teach them how to keep order. In the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; the dangerof the defeat of the Soviet Government is discussed, but the only definite proposals thatare made by which this defeat might be prevented are that every socialist, labour, trade andindustrial organisation in the country should meet and pass a series of three resolutions.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; has no specific proposals to put forward except the passingof violent resolutions, and there is nothing to show that this journal has seriously con-templated the circumstances that would arise were these resolutions put into effectualoperation.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.Nil.   .(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Nil.Part IV. General Topics.Industrial Courts Bill.This Bill was introduced by the Minister on the 3rd inst. Its general scope is indicated in its title, &quot; A Bill to provide for the establishment of an Industrial court and Courts of Inquiry in connection with Trade Disputes, and to continue for a limited period certain of the provisions of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918.&quot; TheBill consists of four parts. Part I defines the constitution and functions of the industrial court. This is to be a standing Court, of whose members some shall be &quot; independentpersons,&quot; some representatives of employers and some representatives of workmen. Ofthese members the Court shall be constituted of such as the Minister may by order direct,and the president of the Court and the chairman of any division of the Court will be such person (being one of the&quot; independent persons &quot;) as the Minister may direct. Any trade dispute, whether existing or apprehended, may be reported to the Minister, by or onbehalf of either of the parties ; and the Minister may, if he thinks fit and if the partiesconsent, refer the matter for settlement to the Industrial Court.Part II provides for the appointment of Courts of Inquiry. The Minister is empoweredto inquire into the causes and circumstances of a dispute, whether or not the disputeis reported to him under Part I, and to refer any matter connected with it to a Cour^of Inquiry, which will consist of a chairman and members, or of a single person, at the discretion of the Minister. This Court of Inquiry has power to require the production ofany documents relating to the subject-matter of the inquiry, and to require the attendanceand evidence on oath of any person who appears to the Court to have knowledge of thesubject-matter.   In case of non-compliance with an order of the Court or perjury, the
person concerned is liable to a fine not exceeding  50 or to imprisonment for a term notexceeding one month. Any report of a Court of Inquiry shall be laid before both houses of Parliament. .Part III provides for the continuance in force of certain provisions of the Wages(Temporary Regulation) Act until the 30th September, 1920. These provisions are : Sec. 1 (Obligation to pay prescribed rates of wages), Subsec. (2) of Sec. 2 (Settlement of differences), Sec. 3 (Powers of Inquiry), Sec. 4 (Definition of prescribed rates of wages),and Sec. 5 (Legal proceedings). In the first two sections certain modifications areintroduced. It will be noted that the provision of the original Act, under which employerscould be compelled to go to arbitration, and were under penalites to enforce awards, has been omitted.Part IV includes certain general items, one of which is the definition of &quot; trade dispute,&quot; for the purposes of the Act, as follows: &quot; Any dispute or difference between employers or workmen, or between workmen and workmen, connected with the employ-ment or non-employment, or the terms of the employment, or with the conditions oflabour of any person.&quot;Railway men and Nationalisation.A &quot; special general meeting &quot; of the N.U.R. was held on the 4th inst., to receive a report from the Executive Committee on the progress of the negotiations with theGovernment on the questions of wages and control. The Executive were requested toreport again to the delegates at a later stage. It is interesting to note that the railwaymen&apos;sleaders seem disposed to undertake something analogous to the miners&apos; educationalcampaign in favour of nationalisation. During the week-end Mr. J. H. Thomas andMr. C. T. Cramp addressed meetings at Cambridge, Birmingham and Walsall. Mr. C. T.Cramp, as was to be expected, was the more outspoken of the two, and explicitly advocateda campaign for the nationalisation of the railways, and urged his hearers to see that therailways were not handed back to competitive ownership. Mr. Thomas contentedhimself with a declaration in favour of partnership in industry, and a statement that the railwaymen were putting forward a claim to be railway directors.Nationalisation of the Mines.The miners&apos; campaign for the nationalisation of the mines, the objects of which werecritically analysed in last week&apos;s Report, is continuing, but is attracting very littlegeneral interest. Mr. Frank Hodges has addressed meetings during the week in Wales,and the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has set up a small committee for the purpose of conducting propaganda work in support of the policy. As confirmation of what was said in last week&apos;s Report with, regard to the lukewarmness of trade unionism in general withregard to the nationalisation of the mines, it is interesting to note that the Steam EngineMakers&apos; Society, in the current issue of its monthly report, insists that the mines are notthe absolute possession of the mineowners or the miners. No man or body of men, itdeclares, has a right to imperil the interests of the community either by continuing towork the mines as private concerns for private gain or by nationalising them, if &quot;suchaction does not benefit every man and woman in the country, whatever his present socialposition. &quot; While those who work our mines and those who find the money to enablesuch work to be carried on have a prior charge on the results of their labours and invest-ments, they are only stewards and may have to give an account of their stewardship.&quot;Such statements as this make it clear why the miners have decided to devote their energiesto a campaign to educate their fellow-workers in the advantages of nationalisation.The i8-Hour Bill.A deputation from the National Seamen&apos;s and Firemen&apos;s Union, headed by Mr.Havelock Wilson, met the Minister on the 30th ult. and protested against the exclusion of seamen from the 48-Hour Bill. This deputation included representatives of mastersand mates and engineers from all parts of the country. Mr. Wilson announced that hewould move an amendment to the Bill in the House of Commons to include seamen, andhe undertook to draft a suitable clause to cover their claims.Trade Union Congress.A special committee of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congressmet on the 30th ult., and discussed (1) the proposals for the organisation of a GeneralStaff for Labour, and (2) the question of the suspension of the ordinary weekly out-of-work donation as from the 21st November.   After some discussion on the question of a
General Staff for Labour the Committee submitted the matter to the conference of theSub-Committee and the consultative members from the trade unions which is to be heldon the 11th November. This Committee, the constitution of which was given in lastweek&apos;s Report, is a remarkably representative body. The Committee passed a resolutionviewing with alarm and consternation the prospect that the out-of-work donation might come to an end on the 21st November. The Committee in this resolution pointed out thatin view of the fact that there is no guarantee that unemployment will cease on the same date, it instructed the secretary to ascertain immediately from the Prime Minister theintention of the Government after that date. It is announced that a special congress maybe called to consider his decision. It may be noted that the Parliamentary Committeeof the Scottish Trade Union Congress has carried a resolution protesting against any reduction in the out-of-work donation.National Industrial Conference.A meeting of the Provisional Joint Committee of this Conference, representing bothsides, was held at Montagu House on the 5th inst. to discuss the situation created by the exclusion of agricultural labour from the 48-Hour Bill. It was decided that the questionof inclusion or exclusion of agriculture should be referred to a joint meeting of representativesof farmers and labourers and that Sir Thomas Munro, Sir Allan Smith and Mr. Henderson,who are the Chairmen of the Joint Committee, and the employers&apos; and workpeople&apos;s side ofthe Committee respectively, should attend this meeting, and state the facts of the case.Engineering Trade Wages.On the 5th inst. the Interim Court of Arbitration issued its award in connection withthe hearing of the claim made by 47 Trade Unions connected with the Engineering trade for an increase of 15s. a week. The Court has granted an increase of 5s. per week as fromthe 1st of December. It will be remembered that in June the Court refused to grant a similar claim. In its award the Court take into account the trend of prices and state thatthere is a general acceptance of the view that considerable increases in the price of variousarticles of food and commodities in common use will take place. The Court draws attentionto its view that industry is seriously handicapped by the uncertainty that must prevailwhen rates of wages are changed at short intervals, and it points out the desirability of taking into consideration the possibility of leaving wages undisturbed for a longer period than four months.Textile Industry.The current journals of Lancashire textile unions note with interest and. alarm thelarge number of cotton concerns Avhich have been recently acquired by Lancashire andYorkshire financiers working through syndicates. It is computed for example that thetotal paid hitherto by &quot; the Amalgamated Cotton Trust &quot; is well over  4,000,000 andthat in many instances three, four, five, six and seven times the share capital is the purchase price. Farnworth Spinning Company, Walker Spinning Company and the LaburnumSpinning Company are to be amalgamated. Arrangements have been made for the saleof Messrs. Eckersleys, Ltd., Wigan, and the Acme Spinning Company, Pendlebury, to anew combine with a capital of  1,000,000. Farton Textile Association, Ltd. a fusion offive separate concerns into one was incorporated in June with an authorised capital of  2,000,000. These are but a few instances of the new development in the textile industry towards over-capitalisation and financial centralisation. &quot; The Power Loom,&quot;the organ of the Nelson and District Weavers&apos; Association, demands the convening of aSpecial Textile Workers&apos; Conference to compel the Government to institute a publicTextile Commission Inquiry on the lines of the Coal Commission. The general attitudeof the operatives is that if speculators are willing to pay such enormous prices, the profits made must he much larger than the masters admit, and that consequently the operativesought to make further and stronger claims for increased wages and better conditions.They also view with alarm and distrust the creation of huge trusts.Income Tax.In view of the general anticipation that the Royal Commission on the Income Taxwill make recommendations favourable towards eliminating income tax on incomes below 210 per year, the agitation in favour of raising the income tax abatement level to  25,is momentarily in abeyance. The South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, which has been particularly vigorous in its advocacy of this level of income tax abatement, decided torecommend its members to adopt the decision reached by the M.F.G.B. on the 22nd ult.(see Report for the 22nd October, p. 350).
(C 1913)The &quot; Daily Herald:&apos;Tlie &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is manifesting considerable activity and anxiety with regardto its future. It is well known that its financial position has always been precarious. Itis alleged to have a circulation of over 300,000 copies daily, but as it has practically noadvertisements, the larger its circulation the larger the deficit incurred. There is aconsiderable amount of doubt as to the sources from which it has been supported. It isnow making a public appeal for a sum of  400,000 in order to extend its activities. Mr.W. 1. A. Foot has been conducting a campaign on its behalf in the North.Amalgamation.In connection with the amalgamation of the engineering unions on which ballotinghas been taking place, seven unions have already reported the necessary majorities infavour of amalgamating. These unions are the A.S.E., the United Machine Workers,,the United. Kingdom Society of Smiths and Strikers, Steam Engine Makers&apos; Society,Associated Brass Founders, North of England Brass Turners, and the London UnitedMetal Turners. The membership of these seven societies totals over 380,000. (See alsounder Trade Union Topics).Trade Union Topics.National Federation of Building Trades. It is reported that the Operative Brick-layers, the &quot; Manchester Unity,&quot; the National Amalgamated Operative Plasterers, the street Masons and Paviors, and the Operative Stonemasons, are to ballot on amalgamationat the last meeting night in November. The Federation^ programme is to create an industrial union for the building trades.Workers&apos;. Union. A meeting of the Workers&apos; Union was held at Cialashiels on the26th October. The divisional organiser of the Workers&apos; Union presided and dealt withthe problem created by the secession of some branches of this Union, to form a Scottish. Industrial Woollen Workers&apos; Union. Apparently the seceding branches have taken upthe machinery of the Workers&apos; Union in their district, and some of them refuse to return the Workers&apos; Union the books and documents rightly belonging to it. The Workers&apos;Union is reported to be endeavouring to persuade the branches to return to its fold, (seeReport for weeks ending the 15th October, p. 337. and the 22nd October, p. 359).Scottish Union of Dock Labourers. The refusal of the Scottish. Union of Dock Labourersto accept the &quot; Tally Scheme &quot; framed by the National Transport Workers&apos; federation and approved by the Ministry of Labour, is attributed to a fear that its introduction is a preliminary to weekly pays, as against daily pays. Objections are also raised to the penalty clause for misbehaviour. -General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners. This Union has voted foramalgamation with the Amalgamated Carpenters and Joiners by 4,389 votes to 1,477.The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners have also approvedof the amalgamation scheme.British Gardeners&apos; Association. This Association has increased its membershipfivefold during the current year. The Union is endeavouring to get all gardeners brought under the provisions of the Corn Production Act and the Hours of Employment Bill.National Association of Industrial Chemists. It is reported that arrangements arenow almost completed for the registration of this body as a trade union.Union of Post Office Workers. A leading article in the current issue of the officialorgan of this Union anticipates that by the end of the present year the Central LondonPostmen&apos;s Association, the Postal Porters&apos; Association and the Grocers Association willjoin the amalgamation. This would leave only the supervisors, the engineers, the sub-postmasters and a few small organisations outside. Of these, the sub-postmasters arenot likely to give up their separate status. The engineers are not likely to reopen thequestion of amalgamation in a single union with, all other Post Office employees Theirpresent tendency is rather to act in concert with general engineering unions.Employers&apos; Associations.National Union of Manufacturers. The Midland Council of the National Union of,Manufacturers have held several meetings recently to discuss the problem of increasingproduction, with especial reference to the Bill drawn up by Mr. A. E. Beck, one of itsvice-chairmen. This Bill provides that in cases of suspected diminution of output,employers should be empowered to give notice to the Board of Trade with a view to theappointment of a committee of investigation. If this committee decides that the decreaseis not proved or that the employer concerned is responsible for the decrease, he should
be liable to payment of costs and a line of  50. If, however, the reduced output is attributable to the slackness of the employees, a percentage of wages equal to the per-centage reduction on output may be deducted from wages. These proposals are to beconsidered by a special meeting of. the Midland branch of the .N.U.M. shortly at Bii-mingham. The Bill is probably impracticable, but it is an interesting and significantsuggestion.Iron and Steel Trade. The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers have requested the British Federation of Iron, Steel, Tinplate and Metal Merchants to draw up for their consideration a definite proposal for co-operation between the two bodies.Ex-Service Men.Employment of Ex-Service Men.-lt is reported that the Federation of Master CottonSpinners&apos; Association has issued an appeal urging all its members to employ a percentageof 2 per cent, disabled ex-Service men. It is estimated that if the terms of the recom-mendation be carried out, approximately 5,000 disabled men would be absorbed. TheOldham Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association have found it impossible to put into operationtheir own scheme for the contribution of each firm to a central fund on a spindleage basis with a view to payment of a wage of  3 a week for each disabled man and the provisionof work for these men in proportion to the number of spindles.Ex-Service Organisation. The first general meeting was held at Caxton Hall on the31st October of the members of the Imperial Ex-Service Association under the presidency of Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice. The Council includes Lieut.-General Sir EdwardBethune, Lieut.-General Sir Alfred Codrington, Lieut.-General Sir Walter N. Congreve,Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, Lieut.-General Sir John Maxwell and Sir FrederickMilner. The following resolution was unanimously adopted: &quot; That this meeting of ex-officers believes it to be in the national interest that all ex-Service men should unite andorganise so as to be able to place their services at the disposal of the State, irrespective ofwhichever party may be in power, in case of national emergency for the preservation oflives, maintenance of social order and food communications.&quot;The aims and objects of the new association may be summarised as follows : (1) Toassist in the fusion of all existing ex-Service men&apos;s organisations into.one non-politicaldemocratic body ; (2) To establish an inquiry bureau for the assistance of ex-officers andtheir dependants on matters of pensions, awards and allowances ; (3) To set up an employ-ment bureau to enable employers to get into touch with suitable ex-officers and to adviseex-Service men with regard to appointments abroad ; (4) To assist the State irrespective of &quot; party &quot; in all circumstances of national emergency.Ex-Service Men and Municipal Elections. The failure to arrive at a satisfactoryworking arrangement for the municipal elections has produced strained relations betweenthe Sheffield branch of the N.F.D.D.S.S. and the Sheffield Trades and Labour Council.The former are taking the line that the interests of ex-Service men can only be adequatelyrepresented by members of ex-Service organisations, owing to the unsatisfactory attitudeof Labour towards the absorption of trainees into industry and the adoption of the national scheme for the employment of disabled men.International Labour Conference.The International Labour Conference at Washington opened on the 29th ult. an account of the first day&apos;s proceedings was given in last week&apos;s Report. At the second session the Organising Committee presented a report of its activities since its creation bythe Peace Conference on the 11th April. With regard to the foundation of the InternationalJjabour Office, the Committee reported that it had been requested by the Secretary-Generalof the League of Nations to name the eight States of chief industrial importance which areto select eight of the 12 Government members on the Governing Board of the LabourOffice. The Committee, after a careful investigation, suggested the United States, GreatBritain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Switzerland, with Spain to be added if germany is not admitted to the organisation. This list has been protested against by canada, Poland and Sweden and the question has been referred to the League of nations for settlement.At the third session Germany and Austria were admitted to full membership of theInternational Labour organisation by a vote of 70 to 1. The only member of the Con-ference who protested against their admission was M. L. Guerin, the French Employers&apos;delegate. The three Vice-Presidents of the Conference are Mr. G. N. Barnes (GreatBritain) for the Government, M. Jules Carlier, Belgium, Employers, and M. Leon Jouhaux,France, Employees.  At the fourth Session, Secretary Wilson, of the United States Labour

The figures on the 15th October were 1,345, as compared with 1.193on the 1st August. With the acquisition of National Factories for the purpose of training,there was reason to expect more rapid progress in placing men, and a material reductionof the waiting list by the end of the year;Wages and Arbitration Department.Court of Arbitration. During the week ending the 1st November the Court ofArbitration heard 13 cases in London. These included the periodical hearings under thearrangements which provide for a review of wages on a national basis in some important industries.

Butler, of the Ministry of Labour,Permanent Secretary-General of the Conference. The following committees have alsobeen appointed : a Credentials Committee and a Commission of Selection. At the fifthsession a Sub-Committee was appointed to study the situation created by the fact thatcertain members of the Conference have nominated only Government delegates. TheLabour delegates protested against this on the ground that the influence of the Governmentgroup was thereby considerably increased. The question of the admission of Finland,Luxembourg and other States was referred to another committee. The question ofunemployment and the status of workers in enemy countries was also referred to a.committee.
Another important case was as follows : Drillers in Liverpool and Birkenhead This was an application by the Ship Constructors&apos;and Shipwrights&apos; Association to the Birkenhead and District Engineering Employers&apos;Association and the Liverpool Engineering Employers&apos; Association for the extension totheir driller members employed in the boiler shops of firms belonging to the Employers&apos;Associations mentioned in the terms of the awards of the Committee on Production(Nos. 2542 and 2543), which gave an advance of 20 per cent, on pre-war pieceworkprices to riveters and caulkers, 20 per cent, on net earnings to platers, and 20 per cent,advance, to lieu workers whose recognised &quot; lieu &quot; rates had not undergone any advancesince the outbreak of war.Request for Action.-ATequ.est has been received from the National Transport Workers&apos;Federation for the formation of a Sectional Conciliation Board for the South Wales areacovered by the Federation.Engine and Cranemen in the Cement Trade.

The employerssuggested a scheme of standardisation by grades. Finally this scheme was agreed to,and will be submitted to the Ministry for ratification early in December.Local Authorities Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers). On the 31st October thesub-committee on provincial councils met to consider the establishment of a provincialcouncil for the Metropolitan area.

On the 30th. October in view of the attitude of the Depart-ment as to the Minister^ inability to extend the wages agreements of the Council underthe Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, the employers&apos; side proposed to adjourn forthree months. The unions proposed as an alternative that pressure should be broughtto bear on the Ministry and that a series of mass meetings should be held.

It is significant that the unemployment figures for-engineering increased from 12,633 to 15,041 between the 10th October and 17th. Thirty-eight firms have entered claims for short-time working arrangements, their employees
numbering 11,76.1. In the Earlstown area, a number of strikers who applied at theExchange for other work were sent to different firms as labourers, with the result that theywere boycotted by members of the National Union of General Workers and could not beemployed by the firms concerned. The Farm Labourers&apos; Union have also adopted thesame attitude.Shortage of Builders. The general problem of resettlement is affected by the shortageof builders attributed in this Division to (1) the retention of skilled tradesmen in theArmy ; and (2) the absorption of large numbers of bricklayers, &amp;c, in various industries where they are assured continuous employment unaffected by climatic conditions.Employment of Ex-Service Men. At Farnworth it is reported that only 12 replieshave been received to the 81 invitations, forwarded to employers for &quot; undertakings &quot; underthe National Scheme.Northern.Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 24th October shows anincrease of 1,697, representing an increase of 1,705 men and a decrease of 8 women.

The Llanelly and district works are still affected by the shortageof water supplies, and the restriction in output which this causes, together with thelabour situation in the United States, will probably tend to maintain the existing highhigh prices for tin plates. Negotiations are on foot with the Government with a view tothe utilisation of the Gwendraeth Valley water supply, which, during the war, servedthe National Factories at Pembrey, &apos;by the Llanelly Corporation. An increase in the.storage supply of water is essential, otherwise local industries will be severely handicappedwhenever there are a few weeks of abnormally dry weather.South Wales Coalfield. The South. Wales coalfield is free from serious disputes.This is attributed to the promptitude with, which the Disputes Committee of the CoalConciliation Board deals with all matters brought to its notice.Scotland.Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 17th October shows a totaldecrease of 148, consisting of 75 men and 73 women, respectively. The situation atRenfrew and Paisley is disquieting, owing to the paying oft of a large number of menfrom the shipyards. The engineering trade at Dunfermline is slack. The finding of posts for men of the light labouring class is a particularly difficult problem in this area.Shortage of Labour. There is a shortage of weavers, winders and. fancy box makersat Bridgeton. At Rutherglen a difficulty is experienced in obtaining skilled men for the chemical and painting trade.^-Shortage of Material. The shortage of steel plates is seriously delaying work, atPaisley shipyards.Shirp Repairing. The lack of ship repairing is the cause of a heavy increase ofunemployment at Leith. An appeal is being made for the Admiralty to give Leith ashare in trawler repairs.Employment of Ex-Service Men.-Six &quot;undertakings&quot; have been received at Kil-marnock and seven at Arbroath.   At Edinburgh, out of 1,347 firms circulated, 85 replies &apos;have been received ; 24 undertakings have been accepted at Bridgeton.   It is felt thatthroughout the division generally the response to the appeal of the National Scheme hasnot been;satisfactory. .
Interrupted Apprenticeships. - -A strong protest lias been made1 at Aberdeen againstthe manner in which&apos; employers in several trades, especially engineering and building,are interpreting the scheme relating to apprenticeships interrupted by war service&apos;.It is reported at Ayr that 63 apprentices have been placed up to date under&apos; the Govern-ment scheme, and that 18 applications are in process of completion.Patternmakers&apos;&apos; Society. It is reported that the Patternmakers&apos; Society through their various branches in Scotland have been exploiting the present scarcity of pattern-makers to enforce concessions independently of those made in the awards issued by theCourt of Arbitration following the periodical review. The fact that a number of firms,including members oi: the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, have been obliged, onaccount of the urgency of contracts, to make concessions, is having a very disturbingeffect, and the Employers&apos; Association are seriously considering the position. ThePatternmakers&apos; Society are understood to have in contemplation the question of with-drawal from the national agreement for the,revision of awards. .   : .:Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland-^lie Executive Committee of the AssociatedIronmoulders of Scotland affirms that a large amount of the work at present being executedby ironmoulders in Scotland has been transferred from firms in.England where iron-moulders are at present on strike. This question was considered at a conference between representatives of (1) The Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland; (2) The Central Iron-vmoulders&apos; Association; (3) The Patternmakers&apos; Society; and (4) The Irondressers&apos;Society. There is, however, a difficulty in obtaining;evidence that the Scottish iron-moulders are unwittingly &quot; blacklegging,&quot; and the investigation by representatives of thevarious unions is being continued., ..... Part VI.-Disputes.        -(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and Allied Trades.Building Trade Operatives-Cambridge. -The strike of Cambridge Building Operatives,which has lasted four months, was settled on the 4th inst. The agreement concedes Is. Id.per hour to tradesmen, Is. h\d. to painters, Is. id. to scaffolders and stone sawyers, and Is. 3^.to labourers with an all-round increase of %d. per hour from the 1st May for a working week of44 hours.  The agreement is to remain in force until May, 1921.Bricklayers-Scottish Steel Works.-The strike of some 450 bricklayers employed at thefurnaces in steelworks throughout Lanarkshire and Ayrshire has now lasted for six weeks.It is estimated that 20,000 steelworkers and some thousands of Clyde shipyard workers havebeen rendered idle in consequence. .....Plumbers Edinburgh. In connection with the dispute over the Government scheme for assisting apprentices (see Report for week ending the 29th October, 1919, page 381) a strike ofover 50 journeymen joiners took place on the 27th ult., the two employers concerned having., ,    refused to sign the agreement form accepting the scheme.Mining and Quarrying. - *   . .Coal Miners Treherbert (Glam.). A strike of about 1,800 miners took place last week: &quot; ; owing to the fact that one workman did not belong to the Federation. The matter was settled by his agreeing to join, whereupon the men returned to work. This strike is interesting as an example of the length to. which the Miners&apos; Federation is. prepared to. go. in pursuance of its policy, which has several times been notified in.the Report, of absorbing into its organisation allmine-workers. .......      .Naval Colliery Company, Ltd. The workmen to the number of 3,000 employed at thecompany&apos;s Adare Anthony &amp; Pandy Pits, Tonypandy, and Ely arid Nantgaryn Pits, Peny-graig, Rhondda Valley, came out on strike on the 1st inst.*as a protest against the dismissal of amaster haulier. .Granite Quarrymen Montgomeryshire. A strike occurred on the 3rd inst., the men demand-ing an increase of wages from 10c?. to Is. 5d. an hour, and a working week of 56 hours.
Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding,Ironfoimders&apos; Strike, No further developments have taken place during the week. Thestrike lias caused the hearing of the application for a 15s. per week increase to workers in the; ,;&apos; engineering and shipbuilding trades which came before the Court of Arbitration on the 29thult. to be regarded with special interest. One firm, Messrs. Brown Lennox &amp; Co.,&apos;Ltd., of Ponty-pridd offered to concede the full demands of the men pending a national settlement. This offer was however declined. The National Strike Committee has issued an appeal to other engineer-ing workers to assist the strikers with funds. In some districts the Co-operative Societiesagree to allow credit to the families of men on strike. There is some evidence that the questionof strike funds is becoming rather serious.   Scottish iron moulders are taking a second ballot! on the question of striking to enforce their demands which are the same as in the case of theEnglish moulders.  It is reported that the vote will probably be heavily in favour of a strike.. It is not yet clear what, if any, effect the declaration of the award, of the Court of Arbitrators(see p. 390) will have on the strike.Engineers Messrs. Straker Squire, Ltd. A strike of all the employees at this firm tookplace on the 31st ult., when six men were dismissed for refusing to work on castings which they&apos;&apos;      &apos; alleged had been turned out by blackleg labour.   The dispute was referred to arbitration and- -     the men agreed to return to work pending the result. 1Textile Trade.Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers Rochdale. A settlement of the strike at the works of messrs. Samuel Heap &amp; Sons, of Rochdale, over the employment of a non-union foreman was settled at Manchester on the 27th ult. The settlement provided that the men should returnto work on the 29th, together with the foreman, they having agreed to withdraw their noticesprovided that a wages&apos; application is considered immediately and a decision reached within14 days.
