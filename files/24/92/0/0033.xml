In some places the extremists talk of making the Borough Councils modelSoviets.The prolonged strike of the Iron Moulders is graduallythrowing the Metal Workers of other traces out of employment,but there has,beeu no disorder.   The men are living on theirsavings and on the oredit given them by the Co-operativeStores.   There oan be no doubt that the rank and file oflabour are steadily drifting to the left.The housing difficulties continue to be serious.   Thereis now a movement among labour to condemn wooden houses.On almost every Labour platform there are attaoks on the&quot;Capitalist&quot; Press,There are talks of a seotional strike among the LondonDockers about five weeks henoe.   The strike Is to be&quot;experimental&quot;.   It was the key-men in the London Docks vfrioprevented the dockers ooming out during the Railway Strike.The/
One Nationalisation campaign is in full progress, butio not, so far, making marked headway.The agitation against the payment of Inoome Tax onless than  250 a year is becoming general.Praotioftlly all the Triple Allionoe Unions and theSngineers are oontemplating strikes within the next fewweeks.   On the whole, it seems likely that the TransportWorkers may be the first to take aotibn.Details are given of the organisation of the ClydeSoviet. &apos; &apos; &apos; l,.The finanoial position of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is notimproving.&apos;&apos; 7,

The -following is a list of the members who are representativeof the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade UnionCongress, the negotiation Committee, and the Trade union side of the Provisional Joint Committee of theIndustrial Conference:-J. h.

3TH;0 ?OAT OF LONDON itUIHQrgTY DOCK flS 1It ia now known that it was the. key workers in thelLondon Docks who averted a dock strike during the recent!&apos;        Msi i 1 f       amHailway Strike. When they were oalled upon to come outjlthe lockmen refused on the ground that the strike wasbadly/Unions, who aoouse them of aelfi53hness and of playingtheir own hand, an accusation which Mr. Saillie worked$Mhard to rebut at the Trade Union Congress.   It is well!to remember that the miners themselves are not yet-unanimous, and that even if they were it would beneoessary to convert their fellow workers in other tradbefore serious pressure oould be put on the Government,The&apos; vote in favour of nationalisation at the TradeUnion Congress, being a card vote, is not to be taken atrepresenting&quot;the final opinion of the rank and file.The delegates at the Conference of the Miners&apos; Federatigave the Executive carte blenche in regard to polioy.The line of the campaign may be Judged from Mr,Hodges&apos; speech at Monohester on October 26th;&quot;If the community is satisfied with a reductii&quot;of 70,000,000 tens in the output, and is satisfiel&quot;to al?ow the system that m&amp;de that possible to go&quot;on indefinitely, then the country deserves all thf&quot;it gets.&quot;He went on to say that the miners wanted to give coal iabundantly, and thaVthere had never been a movement ofmore lofty &quot;moral aspiration&quot; than this; that they desired the support of the other workers, and if theGovernment believed that they were wrong, he invited.&apos; the Government /to go to the oountry and put the matter to the test. &quot;Unless I misjudge working olaasoonsoiousness, the working ola3a will stand the teat.&quot;
badly engineered, was made without any regard to thepublic and without sufficient cause,   it appeared thatthey had not forgotten the action of the railwaymen in the dock Strike of 1912,   It. is now pretty oertain that if:.&quot; they had. been oalled but, these men would have &quot;withdrawnfrom their Union.   In fact, delegates met the Port ofLondon Authority to enquire about their status if theydid withdraw, and were relieved on learning that whetherthey remained in or out their delegates would continueto be recognised.   The attitude of these men affectedMr. Gosling&apos;s action, for when he found that he had notthe whole of the rank and file behind him, he advocatedmediation.It is right, however, to soy that there is a movementon foot among the London lookers to try a sectional strike of their own in about five weeks&apos; time.   It is to be triedas an experiment, and the dockers are calculating that the,.. &apos; -       -..   &apos;. *      ...... o &apos;Government will pay out-of-work donation to the membersof other unions who are thrown but of employment inconsequence, and therefore no hardship will be entailedupon them.LABOUR-ATTACKS UffQN THS P&amp;gSS.Great play is being made in the Labour world withthe &quot;Capitalist&quot; Press.   The attaok is due hot so muoh tothe propaganda of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; as to the action of the Press during the Bailway strike. Their case againstthe Press has been summarised by Mr, Jerome K. Jerome inan article which the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; is circulating inpamphlet/        /&apos;
,.  pamphlet form.   He says:&quot;The Press makes and unmakes Cabinets,   The&quot;publio service is its plaything ........ Ihe Press&quot;is the enemy of the people.   It has usurped the&quot;entire authority of the. country,   Ebcempt from all&quot;responsibility, with neither a body to be kicked&quot;nor a soul^ to be damned, it has become the most&quot;dangerous despotism that Democracy has ever been&quot;called upon to race.   Ihe Press of to-day exeroises;;&quot;the same vioious tyranny that in the Middle Ages&quot;was exercised by the Churoh - the tyranny over men&quot;minds; it rules by the same weapons, lies and&quot;humbug..........,. and the Press itself is in its&quot;turn ruled by the Capitalist&quot;.These attaoks must not be too lightly dismissed, Mcorrespondents from the North report that the working manhas ceased to believe any statements made in the&quot;Capitalist&quot; Press. It might be worth while to point out;that many of the newspapers so condemned put space atthe disposal of the labour leaders.TfeB POLICE union the.police Union is to have a &quot;Flag Day&quot;.on Saturday;next.  Ihe.demonstration in Hyde Park on Ootober 26thwas fairly weir attended, as the men had been told &quot;that ilthey did not oomerthey would be penalised.   She oolleotlciwere trivial.   Zollner is making capital out of the numbJfof policemen who served in .the; sir-r and reoeived Deoorat^This impresses the publio who, of oourse, are not told the proportion of suoh men among the strikers.   Hayesstated in Liverpool on Ootober 24th that he knew enough of Labour matters and intrigues to bring Trade Unionism 1to the ground if Labour played the Polioe Union false.Two police strikers are oontesting Municipal seatsone at Edge Hill and the other at Anfield. /It is reported that the Liverpool City Counoil will promote/
(English) - 5 -promote a short Bill&apos;to amend the local Police Aotin order to give effect to the resolution to distributeI baok pay to the strikers.THE HOUSING question the unrest caused by the housing difficultieshas been frequently alluded to in my reports:   it iscertainly increasing.   In fact, there is probably no more active cause of ^discontent than this.   There is an&apos; outory against the proposal to legalise inoreased rents,and my correspondent at Leeds&quot;states that if the rentsare raised there will be extensive &quot;rent strikes&quot;.Curiously enough, there is a growing oppositionto the erection of wooden houses.   Capital is beingmade by speakers out of what they call &quot;wooden slums&quot;,and the Norwich City Council has defeated the suggestion to solve the looal problem by building wooden huts....     INCOME TAX  . -       ,.The payment of Income Tax on less than  250 a year&apos;s  rapidly becoming a national question.   &quot;InoomeTax Resistance Committees&quot; are being formed, and itseems probable that there will soon be a concertedrefusal to pay the Tax., . . REMUNERATION OP TRADE UNION OFFICIi\I&amp; ... .......     .&apos;&quot;r&apos;We^:appeal for a testimonial to Mr. J. H. Thomas,whioh is signed by Mr.&apos; C. Q?.

Assistant Seoretary, Mr. George Moore, is to have  500,and the salaries of the five Organising Secretaries areto he raised to  400 a year.   Payments to the membersof the executive Counoil and to delegates are to beraised to  1 per day and 4s. Od. per day expenses,THE ?AIN(. AMONG DISCEArcQr^D S0LDI1SRSIn ere has been no marked change during the week.Discontent is likely to beoome aoute if the hardshipsof winter find the men still unemployed.   In severaldistricts discharged soldiers are supporting labourCandidates for Municipal Elections, not because of theirsympathy with the Labour Party so much as to make some kind of protest against the high prices and the lack ofhouses, for in Newcastle ex-soldiers heckle LabourCandidates on the boycott of ex-servioe men by theTrade unions.ISie finanoes of the International Union of Ex-3ervioMen are in a bad way.   Iheir liabilities amount to  50,and they owe Mr. A. H, Hannah, their extremist Seoretary, 30 for salary.THS SOVIET IN GLASGOW AND WEST SCOTLANDDetails have been reoeived of the constitution ofthe Soviet Committee in this area,   There is the central committee of twenty-seven members, and six DistriotiCommittees with thirty-one Sub-Committees, covering,besides Glasgow, greenock, Motherwell, Paisley andBarrow-in-Rirness.   Ihe leading spirits of the central committee are Patrick Burke, James Hess, and William /MoLaine,   Their plan of campaign is modelled on theRussian/
Russian Bolshevik lines.   During the next serious strikeserious sabotage of machinery is to be committed and attacks on the banks andjpublio offices are to be made.They count upon the Military Authority not daring touse guns.   Shese villains of oomic opera are now-confining their efforts to the capture of the ShopSteward movement and to extending their Organisation.They olaim to heve 75,000 supporters whom they admitto be principally boys.   They think that when the timeoomes they will be joined by the Independent LabourParty and the British Sooialiat Party,   They areviolently opposed to the Trade Unions,   They would be quite negligible if it were not that they are supportedby the looal Sinn Feiners.AGRICULTURAL VfthflCSaSFrom several parts of the country I have receivedreports of inoreased organisation among the agricultural workers.   In Somerset, especially in the Taunton andBridgewater areas, the looal Organiser receives a salary of  800 and expenses, and there has been a rapidextension of Socialism. ) In Staffordshire,, members ofthe National Union of iteiilwaymen have helped to foima new branoh of the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union, and propaganda is aotive in Nottinghamshire.   A correspondentfrom the Souta-West has suggested that in the oountry     1villages posters containing elementary eoonomio faotswould be very useful because they 3et slow minds thinking.I have sent hi3 proposals to an unofficial organisation which ooncerns itself with propaganda of this kind.a/   ;
In the Leeds area the farmers are offeringdetermined opposition to the deoision of the Wages Board.A MOVEMENT F0:t THE DISSOLUTION OF JMil^Ml&quot;&apos;A oertain Mrs. Warwiok Ball, hitherto unknown tofame, is trying to organise a petition to the PrimeMinister to dissolve Parliament.   She has the supportof the police strikers, but her meeting in trafalgar square on Ootober 26th attracted only about 300 people,who jeered at the speakers.   The style of her oratorymay be judged from the following excerpt&quot;The Government is a gang of wastrels, liars,&quot;robbers and thieves,&quot;.TO INDEPENDENT lABOPrt  MB VThough greenly oooupied with the forthcomingMunicipal Sleotions, the Independent labour Party hasfound time to engage in other activities for thedismemberment of the Empire.   The City of London Branohwhioh, it will be remembered, has affiliated itself tothe Third (Mosoow) International, has placed its platformat the disposal of the delegates of the african NativeNational Congress.   On Ootober 21st, at Chandos Hall,these delegates appealed to labour to force theGovernment to alleviate the sufferings of the Afrioans,and gave lurid descriptions of the &quot;exploitation&quot; to/whioh they are subjeoted.THE HERALD LEAGUEThere is some dissension in this body.   Mr. Lansbuiand others of the founders are beginning to fight shy ot\violent/
mm   Q   mm(Sngliah)violent revolutionaries suoh as Miss 0&apos;Neill and Davidfiamsay, but oertain bi^anohes refuse to obey, and the result has been uproar at more then one meeting,ME. BQWm WILLIAMS AMD INTEJSVMTIQN IN HJSSIAIn the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of October 23rd, Mr. Williamsadvocates &quot;a frontal attaok on the Government&quot; in regard toKussia.   He says that the Government is aotlng in oppositionto the majority of the people and &quot;to declare a general strike against our policy in relation to rtoasla would not he unconstitutional, but would be a strike to restoreConstitutional Govex-nment to our own oountry.&quot;  He findsit very difficult, however, to awaken any real interestin ffeissian questions.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;In spite of announcements of a &quot;Triumphal Tour,&quot;&quot;Tremendous Applause,&quot; &quot;Great Enthusiasm,&quot; Mr. Poofspropaganda tour in the North is falling rather flat.   InLeeds the attendance was poor and the audienoes wereapathetie.   &quot;Tremendous applause&quot; does not pay for paper,and in a reoent letter Mr. Lansbury deplored his financialstraits-.  He stated that during the strike the paper lost 9,000, and in his issue of Ootober 25th he sayB, &quot;We havenot the money to start new editions.&quot;   Though Mr. BiilipsPrice recently gave  5,000 to the &quot;Herald&quot;, his brother isnow suggesting an additional gift of  10,000,   The sum of. 300,000 whioh was announced to be neoeBsary has nowgrown to  400,000.   She &quot;Hands Off flusBia&quot; meetings in the /provinces have, like the meeting at the Albert Hall, become an excuse for booming the paper,IRELANDIhe past week has been very uneventful in the Provinoesand/
(English) - lO -and even in Munster matters were unusually quiet.   SinnFein is making no headway at present and in some counties)men of moderate opinions are apparently beginning to     ^summon up sufficient courage to condemn in conversation. the recent murderous attacks on the polioe.The dismantling of its press end the suppression of Sinn Fein in the City and County of Dublin on the eveof the annual Ard Feis, or National Convention fixed forl6th instant, have undoubtedly proved a severe blow tothe movement.In the hope of minimising the latter to some extentSinn Fein has just issued to its supporters in theProvinces typed and printed circulars purporting togive the proceedings at the Ard Feis.   The proceedings,even as given in the circular, bear the impress ofhaste.   Ihe Honorary Secretaries presented a report inwhich they asserted &quot;We have secured the mastery ofthe internal political life of Ireland.   We have secured that Irelandfs claim and Ireland&apos;s positionshall be clearly understood by the outside world.&quot;They ol&amp;imed that there were nearly 2,000 Clubs now on the register and urged support of the Dail SireannLoan as one of the most important tasks.No revolutionary speeohes have been recentlydelivered by Labour men as far as the Polioe are awarenor have any samples of revolutionary Labour literatureoome under notioe, but &quot;THE WATCHWOiiD OF LABOlLi&quot;, whichhas been in circulation during the week, is Bolshevistin tone.   This paper seems inolined to trenoh onpolitics as apart from purely Labour oonoerns and ina leading artiole entitled &quot;Ihe three Noes&quot; urges itsreaders to have &quot;No Home :*ile, No.Partition, NoSurrender/
Surrender and let England do her worst.&quot;A report has been received that the issue of handgrenades to the ;ioyal Irish Constabulary has had aconsiderable effeot and the rebels are not keen onattacking polioe patrols.   At the same time plans arebeing disoussed as to methods of attaoking royal irish constabulary Barraoks in order to obtain a supply ofthese grenades.Cathai 0&apos;Shannon is visiting England on November2nd to address the Manchester and District UnitedSooialiet Club when Shinwell, Walton-Newbold, H. Pollittand others will speak.   It is interesting to note thatthere is a connection between Sinn Fein and our ownrevolutionaries.B. H. T,
