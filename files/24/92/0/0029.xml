The wireless messages show the Communists to be in a* state of wild alarm.   The bomb outrages&apos;in Moscow show thatDenikin has his supporters in that city, and the orgy ofexecutions has probably passed them by.   The communist government is reported to have been severely shaken by the fall of Bela Kun and the failure of the British Railway Strike.The actual designs of the Germans in Courland remainobscure.In France, the Labour Movement is split between a minoritywhich favours a forcible revolution and a majority which desiresrevolution by easy stages.   The minority has been urging theSpanish revolutionaries to action and in Spain there is anattempt to bring the syndicalists and anarchists into a    Icommon camp,In Italy the adventure of dxAunun3lo has cut across the plans of the extreme socialists and until the wave of Chauvinismsubsides no revolutionary action is likely to take place.Reports /*
Reports from Germany indicate great Spartacist unrest andaoute distress among the working classes during the winter,hut it is believed, that the Gjverruaexrt is strong enough toquell disorders unless, of course, a re-imposition of theblockade produces deadlock and anarchy.Oil the whole, Bolsheyin.ni appears to bo less menacing tothe civilisation of Europe than it was, but industrial crisesare likely to occur in many countries during the winter.
1 **K1 3 JFRANCE -:.. m:;&apos;- ;   v &apos;&quot;The conversations between M. Clemenceau and Mr.4.r  Lloyd George with regard to the Syrian question appearto. tare dispelled the French suspicions as to the policy$   vof Great Britain in the Bast, and&apos; the anti-British press.   campaign has&quot;been stopped, even In Marseilles, but Great,Britain is &quot;still blamed for the present weakness in thev?t  exo&amp;ange.   The coming general election is now beginning-1.   &quot;to attract the attention of politicians.   The position; / ia.interesting and it is difficult to forecast the:;   results, as much would appear to depend upon tho plans and personal prestige- of M. Clomenoeau, who lias not atpresent disclosed his hand.   The Socialists, at t*n; -Extraordinary National Congress of the Party summoned1,   to settle their programme for the elections, adopted a... k. motion re-affirming&apos; tho unity of;the Party, but-it isreported that this vote was only arrived at after a prolonged discussion, during which the issue hung intho balance.   d)ho Left of the Party, -under the leadorshipi of Longuet, and the Right, under that of Albert Thomas,-    while both willing to declare that a social revolution isnecessary, differ considerably-as to the means by whichit is to be brought about or the extent to which it;.: should attain.   The Confederation Generals du Travail,which now claims two million members belonging toii 2,&quot;500 unions, opened-its Congress at  yons a few dayst after the Socialist Congress at Paris had held itslin-^-xraQKMfsfenoVti *HEfie tdbnie^er&amp;tioft&apos; Generals du (Travail,-like the -Socialists,- is a -prey to internal dissensions.^  It is divided into two main sections:   the Estremist,(Parti Communiste)&apos; under the leadership of M. Pericat5-&apos;and with the &quot;Internationale&quot; as their journalisticorgan/
organ, advocate immediate revolution and the dictatorahof the proletariat; the loss adtanoed section, theacknowledged leaders of which are M,M* Jouhaux andBidegaray, is in favour of a more gradual social- transformation, with the formula &quot;Maximum of productionin a minimum of hours of labour for a maximum of wages,The Congress was held in order to enable the moderateleaders to justify their policy during the war, and since the armistice, against the charges of betrayinglabour whioh have &quot;been &quot;brought against them hy thespctremisto.   Jouhaux, who indicated olearly his objectito seeing an aotive alliance between Trades Unionism anpolitical Socialism, brought forward an explanation ofhio policy - the&quot;Moral Report&quot; - and the draft of aymanifesto constituting the future programme of the confederation (Jenerale du Travail,   The &quot;Moral Report&quot; Iwas approved hy a 7 to 3 majority of the representative!voting, and the manifesto was accepted at a subsequentsitting by 1633 mandates to 234.   The creed of the confederation Gonerale du Travail laid down in thisdboument is fundamentally revolutionary.   It maintainsthat labour ideals can only he carried out hy means ofa complete, transfoxaation of society; it adheres to thotheory of revolution by gradual stages, but is determineto create a privileged position for the proletariat;it recommends increased production, hut only if it oanhe hrought about without increasing the hours of labourIt will be soen, therefore, that the ConfederationGene*rale da Travail is in favour of class war; thatit desires the disappearance of the existing laboursystem and the expropriation of capital, and that itfavours direct action hy means of strikes, but thatfor/
(Foreign) - 3 -for the time being, at any rate, the policy of immediate revolution advocated hy the iistremists hasbeen defeated,   A new International revolutionarysociety, &quot;La Groups Clarte&quot;, has boon established at*12, Ruo Feydeau, Paris,   It is presumably anintellectual socialist group, as its members inoludeAnatole franco, Henri Barbusse. Bernard Shaw, Wells,Iforman. Aagall, efeo,; its programme includes the doctrine of pacific revolution.Although industrial unrest continues in France,and small strikes keep breaking out in all kinds of trades and occupations, it would appear that at themoment Socialist agitation among the working classesis not gaining much ground.   The Marseilles DockStrike, which stopped the entire traffic of the portfor three weeks, was ended on tho 16th of september and the net result of the strike is that the dockerswill receive 18 francs a day, of wfoich only 10 rankas wages.   The men agreed to submit to the finding ofa commission which, it is hoped, will fix a scale of pay commensurate with the increased cost of living.There is now a dock strike at Brest.   discontent among Government Servants is reported to remainacute,and, so long as the cost of living remains so high, the temptation to corruption will remain.   Itis dear that there must also he discontent anduneasiness, especially in the great towns.   Themoroment against profiteering in food continues andin Paris tho Syndicalist; bodies are reported to beactive in tho matter.It is reported from Strasburg that the people are up in arms against the intended orpulsion of15,000 Seiaaa woflcera, aud that a general strike Is*ossm8&apos; EBIiGITM/
BELGIUMBelgium, like other countries, is suffering fromdiminished, coal output, and at the National congress of Minors on September 88th, K. Vanderveldo explained the danger to the miners.   M. Winters, Minister ofFood, speaking in a private capacity, recommended theminers to agitate  for Nationalisation.Copies of the newspapers &quot;Socialisms&quot; and &quot;leCoromuniste,&quot; dated the 17th of September, show thatan extensive propaganda is hoing conducted againstGroat Britain.   &quot;Ic Connuniste,&quot; */vhich is said tohave ho en only in existence for two months, gives the text of a German patont which was registered in Englandon the 26th of March 1916, and asserts that there were many such patents, deducing from this statement that,while tho Belrd^ns w*are fighting, England was trading with tho enemy.Definite proofs have been obtained of the falsityof these statements and steps have been taken to publish an official denial in the Belgian Press. 1SWITZERLANDPublic opinion in Switzerland is much exercisedat the present time by the political situation inEurope.   The mercantile classes,and the employers oflabour genorally, sympathize with the Entente PowerAand are anxious, not only to establish relations withGreat Britain end the United States, but also to makethe League of Nations popular in Switzerland.   Theworking classes,, on the other, hand, arc reported toho in sympathy with the Central Powers and Russia, andare/
(Foreign)     :are opposed to the league of Nations.&quot; &apos;    The.Swiss Government is making efforts to dealwith the Bolshevik menace, and it is reported that many foreign agitators have &quot;been expelled from thecountry.    The political situation in Switzerland,however,   has been described as &quot;critical&quot; and, althoughat the moment things appear to be calmer than theywere a few months ago, a vigorous agitation is being conducted by the Extremists.    Agitators are alwaysendeavouring to enter Switzerland in order to carryon their campaign in that country, France and GreatBritain.    It would seem that Zurich is rapidlybecoming the centre of the Revolutionary activity and another revolutionary outbreak is not impossible.On the other hand, the Basle decision of theCongress of the Swiss Socialist Party to adhere to theThird International was reversed when submitted to a referendum of the whole party.    Fourteen thousandvotes were given against adhesion, and only eightthousand in its favour.    The importance of the votingmay be estimated when it is remembered that largew. numbers of the. workmen in the country are notSocialists and, therefore, did not take part in the referendum.,   It is considered that the split in theSooialist ranks, caused by the reversal of the Basledecision, may be deep.    The Extremists are likely to seize the first opportunity of retrieving theirdefeat, but.it is. probable that the more moderateSocialists will take this opportunity of closing theirranks against the political intrigues of foreignagents.      A special meeting was   recently held atLucerne between Longuet, Caohin, Pedridis, Casteldis,Nobs and Ramsay Macdon&amp;ld, in order to ascertain whether England would join in the class war to bringabout/
H   Q   Mabout the dictatorship of the proletariat.   This isthe plank in the Third International which is said tohavo oausod the split in tho Socialist Party in        ^Switaorland.   Macdonald is reported to have warned thomooting of the dangerous reaction which would ensuewore the aims of the revolutionaries too apparent.   he added that to attain their ends it would be necessaryto dislocato oivil life in England by a policy of continous industrial unrest, each strike being of almost insignificant proportions.   He declared himself to be in favour of the complete independence ofIreland.At a secret meeting of Anarchists held in Zurich!on the BOth of August, Dr. Brupbaoher announced that iJfrenoh section had placed at tho disposal of the Party!a sum of seven million francs, which was intended to I. - provide a fund for anti-Hapsburg and anti-HohenzollerJpropaganda and to form a fund for the families ofcomrades who might bo caught by the authorities.QEBMUTC .* IThough superfioially the Gorman Government scorns!to bo moro secure than it was, it is skating oververy thin ice.   The Communists are conducting a veryclevor secret propaganda, which is believed to havecorrupted the railway men, the Post Office employees and tho industrial workers generally, and now theyare turning tho avarioe of the German poasant to goodlaccount.   Though the Governmont Party knows that astruggle is coming, they keep silence, and theGtorerament Press is purposely optimistic.  Much turnsiupon the fate of the employees  Council Guild, which Iis now before the National Assembly; the Socialists Idemand/
- Y -demand that the employees should &quot;be given an active share inthe management of &quot;every undertaking; their scheme bears a close resemblance to the Soviet system in Russia, and theyhave called upon all workers to register their names inorder to vote for the Central Workers1 Council,   The term&quot;worker&quot;, it should be noted, is liberally applied and includes professional men, clerks, etc.   Meanwhile, theGovernment is forbidding the publication of fresh newspaperswithout sanction and prohibits tho issue of inflammatorypamphlets.   &quot;Die Freiheit,&quot; the central organ of theIndependent Socialists, goes so far as to say that thoMonarchists aro plotting a counter-revolution through the   ^military forces in the Baltic Provinces.   Tho german press is full of warnings of a revolution which Is to takeplace during the winter months; the miners aro said to beplanning revolutionary action and the Communists generally to &apos;be awaiting tho signal.   If it comes, the centre of the&apos; disturbance will probably be Brunswick.&quot;   Tho distress of the unemployed will oortainly beterrible during the coming winter, for, in addition to&quot;the demobilised soldiers and&apos; refugees, work, food, clothing* v-:&apos;: arid, dwellings have to bo found for 000,000 prisoners of war,and&apos;the&apos; lack of ooal, the.dislocation of transport and thehousing difficulty will prevoct many factories from working.Everything will turn upon the loyalty of the Rrqchswehr.who&quot; number some 15,000 men.   Of these, 5,000 are believed tobe absolutely trustworthy; from 7,000 to 0,000 are lessdependable, though they will fight the Communists as longas they continue to be. successful; if,however, they hadreverses, it is believed that they would change sides;the remaining 2,000,. to 3,000, men aro believed to bo permeatedwith disloyalty.   Still,,a woll-officered force of 12,000men is believed to be sufficient to hold 50,000 Bolsheviksin/
-t 3 **(Foreign)in check, provided that the clever and persistentCommunist propaganda does not make further inroads intothe morale1 of the Rei chswohr,Tho Government can also rely upon the Security Police(SICHERHEITS POLIZBl), which is formed of the bestelements of the old Army and is well armed.The Reactionary Parties in Germany have made no sign lately, though they are believed to be active in holland, in two sections, one of whioh, under von Bluoher,is working for the restoration of the Monarchy in theterritory West of the iMne, in Bavaria and parts ofSaxony, while the other, led by the german Minister atthe Hague, is in favour of establishing a morebureaucratic regime in Germany itself.At a conference of the Independent Socialists heldin Berlin last month, it is said that a rising was planned to begin about the end of October or early inNovember; the first move will be a general strike, andthe. Government will then oall for volunteers.   TheGovernment expects Spartacist outbreaks in Dusseldorfand the industrial dJJtricts of Westphalia, and perhapsalso in Munich, where the police have discovered aSpartacist plot to seize the barracks and shoot theofficers.  Many Spartaoistji leaders have been arrested and quantities of revolutionary literature have beenseized at a printing works at Charlottenburg.The Gorman liberal newspapers were much impressed by.the measures taken hy the British Government fordefeating the. Railway Strike, for the election ofMr. Henderson for Vfidnes appears to have given theimpression, to the Radicals that a Workmen^ Governmentwas about to be established in England.It has been suggested that one reason for the&apos; &apos; fall/
fall in the raluo of the mark has been the purchase, by german firms, of large qijantitlos of goods from abroadfor which they have paid in foreign currency.   The markhas nor; advanced, apparently on rumours of a possibleloan from America.The Centre Party in the Ehlneland is in favour ofHhoniHh independence within the German State and isdenouncing the agitation in favour of separation.The &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; repeats a message fromCuxliaven that there is an agitation in Heligoland infavour of the restoration of the island to Great Britain.There i3 talk of a plebiscite on the question.AUSTRIAExternally, but for the shortage of fuel, life inVienna flows on as usual, but underneath the surface theposition is vary serious.  A week ago the rate ofexchange fell from 190 kronen to the  1 te 260 kronen.A capital levy up to 50 or 60 per cent is expected,together with a new note iBsue and a cancellation of ,90 per oent of the old notes.   Meanwhile, the rioh aresmuggling their jewellery end securities out of thecountry by diplomatic couriers, and the capital levy will fall far short 6f expectations.   The peasants only are   .prosperous; mortgages have been paid, off and they arebuying luxuries in clothing, jewellery and furniture.Moreover, the peasant now shows a tendency to retainwhat he produces for himself.   The rationing of foodstuffs is evaded in every possible way, and theseoret dealers are actually persons in receipt of the weekly Government dole.   In fact, nothing but a strong and stable Government, resolved to deal resolutelywith the financial and economio situation, can saveAustria from an upheaval.Bolshevism/
(l?ore Ign)Bolshevism does not appear to hare establisheditself In Vienna except among a few intellectuals, whoplay with academic Communism.   The Government is relyingupon the &quot;Volkswehr,&quot; in which no one places any ^confidence, and in the country districts independentguards have been raised out of the ruin of the formerGendarmerie.Dr. Renner is reported to be resolved upon remaining in power as long as possible, and,while he remains,Bauer*s influence will be paramount.   But a Governmentwhich subsidises public   demonstrations in its favour cansoaroely exist for long.   It is said that during the*last Volkswehr demonstration in Vienna, in which 12,000people took part, evory man received 5 kronen as areward for his political energy.It is reported that a Royalist plot, withheadquarters at the Military $technical Commit&apos;^e inVienna, has been discovered and this Is not unlikely,sinoe a Monarchist press campaign is now being carriedThe Christian Socialist Party is working in favour ofthe restoration of the son of the ex-Emperor Karl, undeithe regency of tho Arch-Duke Bugen, who is considered to be a &quot;clean man.&quot;The Communist, Meloher, who has reoently been inLinz, is reported to be organizing the Communists in upper Austria, It is not clear from whence he is drawihis supplies of money. The acute shortage of coal, whiIs attributed to the failure of the Czechs and the Poleto carry cat the obligations laid upon them by the PeaoTreaty, is producing an atmosphere peculiarly favourablto Bolshevism.   The Electric Works reoeived only onewaggon/
waggon of coal on the 20th September and on thefollowing day none at all.   Street railways havehad to olose down, and the  owners of motor oarsare profiteering shamelessly.HUNGARYBela Kun&apos;s Dictatorship is said to hare costHungary 13.675,000,000 kronen.   The Red Army alonecost 2,660,000,000, and 150 millions were spent onforeign propaganda.  An equal sum was lost throughfrauds,Something very like a White Terror is reportedto have been proceeding during the first few weeks of Friedrich^ term of office, and this is said tohave alarmed and alienated the working classes.   the roumanians are defending themselves in their wirelesscommunique against the charge that they have been*robbing the country of machinery and other property,but there is certainly a strong popular feeling against them.The Hungarian Socialist Party is said to havedecided to expel all the Communist elements and toreturn to the Seoond International, notifying theSocial Democrats in other countries of their changeof policy.A State Tribunal has been appointed to tryMichael Karolyi, Bela Kun and his associates,The moderate Socialists are pressing for theformation of a Coalition Cabinet under the tutelageof the Entente, and a wireless message has beenreceived that Friedrich has beon notified that hisGovernment would not be recognised.The/
- IE -The Oourt, constituted at Bada^Paoth. for tryingthe Hrjiuu-rian Conyriunists, decided that Soviet law is.. :  null and void, and therefore the plea of the accusedthat their- actions were justified under the existing law is ruled out.   T3io accused include the judges andjurymen of the Revo3,utionary Courts.ITALY      ^ ,The political situation in It.ay has been oonsideraticomplicated by d^nnunzio1&apos;]. seizure, of fiumo, and theposition of the Government, both at home and abroad, isone of great difficulty.   It is reported that the Arayand the Navy are openly siding with d^nnunziOj and histheatrical coup, which is well advertised in the press,has undoubtedly appealed to the popular imagination.   Itis estimated that the poet has now a force of from10,000 to 15,000 men under his command, and it is statedthat reinforcements are continually joining him.   Thereare no indications, however, that the Government has changed its attitude of hostility towards him, and thedecision of the Oroun Council not to, recognise the seizinof 3?ii7me has no doubt strengthened Signor Nitti!s positiiIt is considered that if a satisfactory settlement ofthe whole question of the Adriatic littoral could be arrived at there would be a reaction against Vkmmzio,All parties in Italy would appear keenly interestedin the fivsno situation.   The so-called patrioticrevolutionary parties and leagues insist that the Govemmshould recognise the step taken, by d/Annunzio, eventhough it leads to war with Yu;p-Silvia and to complicatwith the Allies.   Mexivhile, as a protest against thestrikesdanger of another war, political/are threatened by theSocialists and Labour organizations; the Extremists inparticular are organizing meetings denouncing the dangeijof/
of a Military dictatorship,The Nationalists affirm that this agitation is. secretly oncduraged by the Government, who find in itproof that the majority of the people are against. d1 Anmmzio; nevertheless the Socialists and Labour-leaders undoubtedly fear to run the risk of provokinga civil war, which is perhaps within the bounds of possibility, as the patriots or &quot;Fiumani,&quot; as thesympathisers of d^lnnunzio call themselves, are determined to attack the Soci&amp;Lists, and for this purpose roly onthe help of the Army.L^tounzio has admitted that, apart from the questionof Fiume, he has a personal determination to drive SIgnorNltti from power.   Nitti is unpopular for his tolerationof the Socialist campaign against the-Army and N&amp;vy,brought about by the publication of the enquiry aboutCuporotto, and his policy of hastening demobilisation and reducing expenditure.A telegram from Borne, dated October 5th, reportsthat the Italian Chamber has voted for the openannexation of Fiumo,There has boon a marked improvement recently inthe relations between the Government and the Holy See.Indications of this rapprochement may be found in theacceptance of decorations from the King by the Cardinal, ^Archbishops of Pisa and Turin and by the request made from the Vatican that the Popo&apos;s Legato to Jerusalem,Cardinal Giustini, should be conveyed to the Holy Landin an Italian warship.These incidents are no doubt signs of the times and,   .  point to the ultimate reconciliation between Italy andthe Papacy, but they should not be interpreted as any real/
(Foreign)real evidence that the Pope is prepared to renouncehis temporal claims or to reoognise the ItalianGovernment.   The Catholics in Italy have formed apolitical party, known as the Popular Italian Party;it is not yet Very powerful, &quot;but it is said to be well organised a&amp;d disciplined.   The Clerical and socialist parties are displaying great activity with regard tothe coming elections.   The Italian&apos; Socialists at thepresent time can be divided Into four groups, which,although working for a common goal, differ considerably in their methods.   Three of these groups advocate a revolution of violence; the fourth is in favour of reform by means of constitutional methods.   Two of the groups - the anti-Parliamentary Electionists and the production-Parliamentary Eleotionists - form the ItalianBolshevik Party.   The first of these groups is led byBordiga, editor of the &quot;Soviet,&quot; and is a comparatively small body which forms the extreme Left wing of theSocialist Party; the second group is led by Serrati,editor of the &quot;Avanti,&quot; Bombacci, Gennari and Salvador1the first three of whom are on the Executive Council othe Socialist Party.   These two groups of Extremistsboth stand for the policy of the Third International,refuse any collaboration between the Proletariat andthe Bourgeoisie, and urge the formation of councils dworkuen and labourers, in order to prepare the massesfor the acceptance of a Communist regime.   They are aivariance, however, upon the question of whether or nolSocialism should be represented in Parliament.   Bordicontends that the Socialists should ignore theforthcoming elections and should direct their efforts to propaganda outside Parliament.   The third group iscomposed of the open advocates of Communism, whodeprecate
B; ^ 15(Foreign) -deprecate violence and hold that the time ia notyet ripe fcr revolution.   Its leaders are L&amp;zzari,secretary of the Socialist Party, Bacoi and Vella,members of the Executive Council, and Morgari, Maffiand Kusatti, who are socialist members of Parliament.Morgari is now under arrest in Vienna as a Bolshevik -agent.   The fourth group controls the.principal labourorganizations-and federations.   Its policy is reported*to be one of Socialist reconstruction by ms-ans of the peaceful oo-operation of the working classes with thebourgeoisie.   This group, isMch believes in reform by parliamentary&apos; methods, and the Communist Group, appearto be the most powerful sections of the SocialistParty.   The failure of the general strike in July was somewhat of a shock to the Socialists and since thatdate a vigorous campaign has been carried out in thecountry,, which may produce results before long, forthe general industrial unrest in Italy bas resultedin the formation of many Socialist organisationscomposed mainly of the younger men, who advocaterevolutionary methods of the most violent nature.   the increases, circulation of the &quot;Avanti,&quot; the officialorgan of the Socialist party, which has now reachedhalf a million, is significant in that this newspaperis conducting a Bolshevik campaign.   The persistentrumour that tho paper is financed with Russian andHungarian money has not so far been verified.   TheItalian Socialists, however, claim to be in touch withMoscow and the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, and undatedletters from Lenin to Serrati have appeared in the&quot;Avanti.&quot;   It is quite possible that the letters mayhave been smuggled into Italy with the connivanoe ofmen/
(Foreign)men on tho Italian State Railways, many of whom areSocialists.   Iho Italian Police claim that it ispractically impossible for Hungarian Communists toentor Italy, hut tfoeir optimism is consideredunwarranted.   A gang of anarchists has &quot;been arrastedat Milan.   (The men confessed that they were responsiblefor the recent bomb outrage at Milan.   Another bomboutrage occurred at Taranto.   No connection between these anarchist outbursts end the Socialist agitationhas been established; at any rate none has been made public.   The action of the King in ceding the crown lands to the State has been much appreciated and isconsidered by certain sections of public opinion to bea recognition by the Italian Government of the justification of the individuals who recently initiatedthe expropriation of land in the province of Rome.The printers1 strike in Rome,, which lasted for two months, and which was attended by several bomboutrages, has at last been settled,   taring the courseOf the strike only two daily newspapers; woro Issued,the &quot;Av&amp;nti&quot; and the Conservative &quot;Popolo Romano,&quot;the printers of which were non-Union men.A new Government, with General Ali Riza Pasha asGrand Viaier, has just assumed office in ConstantinopleAn election is to be held and a new Parliament convokedThe new ministers are opposed to the Committee of union and Progress and may be able to check its rapidly growing influence in Asia Minor, which their predeoessoseemed powerless to resist.It is reported that Mustapha Kernel Pasha, the leader of the Nationalist Movement inaugurated by theCommittee/
ign)Committee of Union and Progress, has occupied Koniawith his troops and expelled the authorities.   TheCommittee continues to oarry on Its P&amp;n-Islampropaganda in the chief European capitals in orderto cause dissensions among the various Powers.   Thepre-war propaganda,which won for it the almost solidsupport of educated Indian Mohammedans, is now said to&quot;be proving useful In Its intriguos.   The Committeeis reported to he in touch with the Central IslamicSociety in London.  An anti-British leaflet was recently distributed iri Scutari,   It calls upon thepeople to rise against their historio foes, theBritish,   The Sayyed Euosoin is stated to be of theopinion that if &quot;Wahabism,&quot; which is apparently an improved form of Bolshevism, were introduced intoIslamic countries, it would prove even more successfulthan Bolshevism.BULGARIAMr. Blageoff, who used to be leader of the NarrowSocialists, the Extremist wing of the Socialist party,is reported to have admitted that, while there was atpresent no hope for Bolshevism in Bulgaria, it was yetnecessary to have ready a Bolshevik organization intho country in follow of the anticipated revolutionaryoutbreak throughout Europe.   He stated that the NarrowSocialists have prepared a black list of all personswhom they wish to arrest should the opportunity arise.The list is said to include tho names of two BritishIntelligence Officers and of a French Commandant.&quot;Any other Allied Officers who might be present at thetime of the revolution&quot; ate also to bo arrestod.   plans have been prepared for the seizure of the railways,public buildings and the property of rioh families.   The&apos;Array/
(3?oryi;iti)AiKy is expected to provide 70$ of deserters.   It is- reported that the Bolsheviks in Bulgaria have receivedfurther assistance from Russia, together with instruction to bring the growing revolution to a head.POLANDThe fall of P^derewski1s Government, which is atpresent being attacked from all sides, would be adisaster to the country.   If it falls the only way of saving the country from a Socialist Government is*thought to be a Militaiy Government under Pilsudski,who would be supported by the Ri^ht in spite of hisrevolutionary past,Tho activity of Bolshevik agents in Poland iareported to be increasing.   Communist agitators are endeavouring to bring about a revolution end their influence in the army has spread.   The Government issaid to he alive to the danger and to be taking everyprecaution, but, so long as there is no material improvement in the economic condition of the country,it is clear that its position is one of extreme difficulty.   Its main souroe of strength at presentseems to be that the Extremists are finding it no easymatter to combine the various elements of opposition,as the workers in the towns and the peasants, who ar&amp;their main supporters, hold views vshich are diametricalopposed to each other.   The opening of the Polish Dietat Warsaw on the 3rd of October passed off undertranquil conditions, in spite of threats of disturbanceBALTIC states the operations of the Germans are causing greatuneasiness/
uneasiness.   Von der Goltz has heen officially recalled,and the Government has declared that his troops will nolonger he paid.   On the other hand, Mnjor Bischoffsfire-eating declarations show that a portion of. thetroops is out of hand and is disarming the Letts andexacting taxes from the population.   Mo doubt thismutinous and determined body would make short work ofany Bolshevik defence if it decided to advance towardsPetrograd, especially if internal disorders break outin Petrograd and Moscow in consequence of Do-jikin^approach.His troops have declared their intention of notreturning to Germany.   The state of the negotiations between the republics of E3thonia, Lettonia and lithuania and the Russian Soviet Government is somewhatobscure.   Negotiations were opened at Pskoff on the 17thof Soptembor between the Esthonians and the Bolsheviks,but broke down as the,Eothonian3 considered themselvesunable to make peaoe, except concurrently with the otherBaltic States.   Since that date there have been rumours of further negotiations, but no definite news has beenreceived of their having been re-opened.ROUMANIAThe Government reoently formed is of a military character because the political parties could not be combined.   The country is reported to he oalm.A report from Bucharest states that a secretprinting press and a quantity of revolutionaryliterature have been seiaed and several members of theSocialist Party arrested.FINLANDPublic opinion in Finland is said to be opposedto/
to tho conclusion of peace with the Bolsheviks inRussia, and the press of the Eight has started a violent campaign in favour of Finnish intervention inIfc-^ia and viev/s with apprehension&apos; the peace offer made &quot;by the Bolsheviks to the BJLtio States,   It isreported that tho organisation of the volunteers is proceeding, in spite of the opposition of the socialists and it is considered that President-Stahlberg is losingground.   Socialists of the Right Wing, on the otherhand, aro stated to he impressed with the necessity for making peace with Soviet Russia and have urged theEsthonians to such a course of action.   The present state of undeclared war on Bm33ia is thought to he oneof the causes which is spreading Comnunism in finland and, should the Monnerheim party succeed in itsactivist programme, civil war would he the consequence.Reactionary Democrat appointments and other signs of theGovernment1i susceptibility to reactionary influencesare antagonising the Socialists, and it is said thatthis Is partly responsible for the spread of Bolshevism.A split in the Socialist Party on the question of communism Is reported, and the rank and file of theParty are divided into two sections, the DanotfratioSocialists and the Communistic Socialists.   german propaganda is busy in Finland and is of an anti-Britishcharacter.   Tho Gmi^ne, it is stated, issert that theBritish can give no assistance to the Finn-.&apos; becauseBolshevism is so acute in England that it is certain to break out in an even more acute form than Spartacismin Germany.SV/EPEEf    ,Competent observers express the opinion that theSwedish/
&apos;    - 145**. SI **(Foroi; n)Sr:orirish Government haa ah own great weakness in itahandling of the present industrial troubles.   Itappears to be afraid of the extreme Socialists, andit will be interesting to see whether it will beable to resist their demands for the resumption oftrade end diplomatic intercourse with Soviet Raa*i&amp;.It is reported that the Swedish Union of TransportWorkers, which recently was opposed to this policy,has now decided,:fco adopt direct action,in order toforoe the Government to come to terms with theBolsheviks.   On the other hand, the efforts of the extremists to bring about the ^blockade&quot; of &quot;black&quot;Russia by persuading the transport workers to hinderthe transport of war material and &quot;other goods to countries at war with the Bolsheviks, so far do notappear to have been attended with much success.   the left Socialist parties have issued an invitation toa Scandinavian Workmen^ Congress, which will probablybe held in Stockholm about the middle of November.All trade and workmen*s organizations which professsocialistic or revolutionary aims have been asked tosend representatives.   The agenda of the Conference,Which is designed to improve the co-operation betweenthe various Extremist parties, includes:   the scandinavian Workers1 organizations and the WorldRevolution; the tasks of the trade organizationc, theirmethods and aims; the Soviet movement and socialisation,and inter-Scandinavian co-operation.   Bolshevik propaganda continues in Sweden and large quantities ofliterature, mainly printed in Finnish, were recentlydiscovered by the police on an island west of Mariehamm.Swedish/
Swedish law permits the freedom of printing and, unlessprinted matter provokes a   foreign protest, interventionis difficult.   The export of Bolshevik propaganda is prohibited, hut it is always possible to evade theauthorities by means,of export on small vessels.   TheFinnish pross has now attacked the Swedish Governmentfor not preventing tho export of propaganda.The leaders of the Scandinavian Bolsheviks areorganizing a Scandinavian Confess to take plaoe in stockholm in Siptomber,   Strom, tho ex-Deputy, recentlyasked the Government If he might send a wireless message to Tohitcherine, advising him to mako an offer of Peaceto the Entente, which he believed would be favourablyreceived by the British Government.   His renuest was refused.   It will be remembered that Strom is theBolshevik representative in Sv;eden and the sender of funds to Silvia Pankhurst &quot;by Zuclu;riassen.   The referendof the Swedish Left Social Democrats has resulted in adeclaration of adherence to the Moscow Internationale.NORWAYTho majority report of the Norwegian ParliamentaryCommission on Profits, on which were representatives from all classes, has now been issued. The legisaationwhich the report advocates will secure for wage-earnersa direct influence on the organisation and management oindustry by means of the establishment of electedindustrial councils, on which they will be directlyrepresented.   These councils will deal with all questicIof health in factories and workshops, wages, hours of labour, overtime, payment for piece work, appointment gof foremen and works managers, the introduction of new methods of work, etc.   Ovur the industrial councils itis proposed to institute district councils, the chairaof

It is intended that the national council shall be an economic counterpart to the Storthing.   Theleaders of the Christiania Workmen1!! Union are endeavouringto arrange a compromise 4n order, to induce the SocialDemocratic Opposition Group, whicft broke away from theSocial Deviocratic party on aocount of the extreme viewsof some of the party    leaders to rejoin the party.This attempt would appear to indicate that the leaders,   of the party havo not lost the confidence of their followers to the extent which the secession of the SocialDemocratic Opposition Group seemed to show.   Tro:adh4omis now the headquarters of Bolshevism in Norway and itis stated that a courier service has been&apos;establishedo   to SvtoA m and Denmark.  Bolshevik literature andpamphlets in Esperanto are printed in Stockholm, andit is believed that a still more vigorous Bolshevik propaganda will ha opened this autumn.  NorwegianSyndicalists are organizing the prohibition campaign,which has resulted in a majority vote for prohibition,their object being to bring about a tariff war withS-Kln, teiice, Portugal fend Italy.   It is reported from Stockholm that Oerjiaa propaganda has greatlydiminished recently in Chris tiania,, and that the germans are now directing their energies against the Bolshevik. : agents in Norway.-   DENMARKIt is reported that, In.the event of seriousindustrial/
industrial disturbances which may arise in Denmark,owing to the present antagonism between the EmployersUnion and the Danish Workmen^ Union, the government considers that it can depend upon the loyalty of thetroops recruited from the rural distriots.   It wouldappear, however, that equal reliance cannot be placed upon regiments   recruited in Copenhagen and that the integrity of the police is doubtful.   Much loot fromRussia (among which it is alleged are jewels belongingto the late Empress) is&apos; being sold in Denmark.EOHtANDThe Procurator-General has stated that the presentsituation in the country as regards Bolshevism is satisfactory, but that should a Bolshevik revolutionbreak out in Germany it would be difficult to prevent it from reacting in Holland, especially should food and fuel become scarce.   At present it is considered thatthere are sufficient stocks of coal, if they are care full!distributed. -The recurrence of small strikes isreported throughout the country.   The Government appearsto be acting with tact and energy.   It has deniedthe rumour that reliance could not be placed on the polifof Amsterdam and Rotterdam.   It is, however, actively engaged in recruiting military police.   Changes areanticipated in the leadership of the Communist Party.Wynkoop appears to be losing ground and it is reportedthat De lutraan is trying to take his place.   the editor of the &quot;Jong Socialist,&quot; the organ of theCommunistic youth at the Hague, states that it isproposed to hold a secret meeting of the &quot;Youth&quot; partyat Helsingfors.   The Youth*s organization, oallad&quot;De Zaaler&quot; (the Sower), of the Hague, has been convokedand representatives from other countries, includingEnglan
m 2fi ***(Foreign) .....England, France, Germany and Switzerland, Yd 11 attend the meeting.   Unconfirmed rumours suggest a possiblesplit in the Dutch Socialist party on account ofTroelstra*s speech at Zurich.   In the event of such anoccurrence, it is probable that tlxe majority of theparty would follow Troelstra and that the remainderwould form a Socialist Reform Party,    ,A Revolutionary club has been formed in order to collaborate the work of other groups of Extremists,foment strikes, paralyse public services and by thesemeans to promote a revolution,   The workpeople are advised to obtain arms.Tho president of the Club is Wynkoop, and thesecretary Alex. Iiisser,As an example of labour unrest in a usuallyphlegmatic community, it may be mentioned that theDutch Domestic Servants1 Union is demanding, three freeevenings a week and half-days on alternate Sundays.W: : SPAIN ... - &apos;    &apos;    &apos; &quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;With the exception of the strike of the mercantilemarine, practically all the labour stoppagos are nowterminated and the situation generally appears to beoalmor.   The Military Governor, Don Julia Amadam issaid to take an optimistic view and not to beanticipating any revolutionary outbreak.The causes of the recent disturbances in Barcelonaappear to be mainly economio, for though wages havebeen raised, they are said not to be in proportion tothe increased cost of living and to the large profits made by employers during the war.   The Government is^W/
(foreign &amp;a)now trying to improve the scale of wages and to reduceprofiteering,   Bolshevik agents, however, are &quot;busy in spain and although the revolutionary movement at presentlacks funds and organization, there is little doubtthat the assiduous propaganda will have considerable influence in the near future.   It is reported that theremay be sorious trouble in Valencia owing to the Syndicalistpropaganda among tho agricultural labourers.   There is atraditional hatred for the employer in this part of thecountry, and though during the past twolve months thewages hare been greatly increased, the labourers refusedto reap the harvest unless the employer came and workedwith them.   Indeed, in one instanoe thoy seized the employer and his family and tied them to olive treesuntil the crop was got in.   It is not many years since a mob of these labourers descended upon Oferosa,armed with scythes,to cut the throats of their employerswhile they wore sitting in their clubs.Observers anticipate that attempts may be made tobring about a general strike of a revolutionary oharacter Ithroughout Spain,   Some interesting letters have recentlycome to hand which seem to indicate that the Spanishrevolutionary movement derives much of its inspirationfrom Paris.   One of these letters, which-is signed byJuchesnel, is entitled ITThe Instructions of Bartwig,&quot;The letter summarises  he programme necessary for theestablishment of a Soviet form of government and thepolicy of such a government when established.   Thefirst principle laid down is that the moral of theArmy must be undermined, so that when the signal isgiven all officers may be shot without trial, and the arms of all soldiers who refuse to join the revolutiondistributed/
- &apos; 148- 27 -distributed among the workmen.   Should the insurrectionho  successful a Government is to &quot;bo established atBarcelona, wliere an Assembly General of Councils willbe set up.   The Soviet will seize all private capital and public funds, but will recognise the debts of theState.   There will be a minimum wage of 100 lesetasa week.   A second letter expresses the opinion that everything possible should be done to cause industrial unrest throughout the country, especially in the miningdistricts of the Asturias, which the writer states arebeing fomented by Frossard and the deputy Doizd, onbehalf of certain English interests.   A third letter,which is dated Paris, 7,8.19, and signed H. Dieu, statesthat &quot;This Committee&quot; expects to start the revolutionary-   movement in Uovomber and believes.that Spain will notbe ready,   With regard to the strike propaganda, the writer urges that economio oauses should bo assigned forstrikes,, as many workmen would withdraw their support ifthey understood that they wore assisting a revolutionary: . movement.     . -As in this country, the great need in Spain isbettor housing.. In the mining districts the housing is so bad that every bed is said to be used by eight men inshifts, and in one place, during the epidemic ofinfluenza, they had to double the size of the collierycemetery.   Public opinion among the better classes hasnot been awakened to this need.As an example of the bad state of law and order atpresent existing in Barcelona, it is interesting to note that Brado Portillo, former Chief of Police in thatCity, was recently murdered at 2,30 in the afternoon inone of the main streets of the City, the assassionsbeingable/
able to escape in a motor oar.Portillo acted as a master spy for the Germans duitthe war, hut his death was probably due to revenge forIIhis having revealed the secrets of the SyndicalistOrganizations, in order to curry favour with theGovernment.PORTUGALThe new President, 3)r, Antonio Jose d1 Almeida, whoassumed office on the 5th of October, is reported tobe a moderate socialist.   The fact that he controls aconsiderable party of political followers is said to bethe subject of genoral criticism, as it is consideredthat the Chief of a political party should not bePresident of a Parliamentary Republic.   For the moment,however, the political situation in Portugal appearsto be calm, although there is no doubt that theSidonist-Monarchist Party is strongly opposed to theGovernment,   The strong and successful action takenby the Government in suppressing the railway strike hasjgiven it considerable prestige, and it appears to havethe support of all the Conservative elements of thepopulation and to enjoy the confidence of the Army.   Therailway strike was entirely broken by the loyalco-operation of the soldiers end sailors.   This wouldappear to prove that, in spite of violent propaganda,the Bolsheviks have failed to influence the moral ofthe fighting forces.   Some of the Extremist newspapersare indulg5.ng in an anti-British campaign and the&quot;Avante&quot;, after its temporary suppression, has-appeared as the avowed advocate of &quot;free love.&quot;EGYPT/
(Foreign) 149HTMThe labour unrest oentinues and the reoent twenty-four hours&apos; strike by the Cairo printers was marked bya certain amount of roTOlutionary agitation.   The latestmove of the &quot;Bourse du Travail&quot; has heen to attempt toexercise a censorship of the local press in regard toits oommentB on labour troubles.   The editor of the&quot;Egyptian Mail,&quot; an satisfaction-labour newspaper, was informedthat the lino-typists would not set up any articlesattacking the Trade Unions.   It is reported that the most dangerous agitators in %ypt are Italian soldiers whohave returned to the country after their militaryservioe.  An Italian Journalist, an Extremist agitator,has been served with an order of expulsion, and it isexpected that other Italians will also he deported.Egyptian Nationalists at 2urioh are in touch with therevolutionaries, and the Italian Socialists in Switzerlandare said to be taking a leading part in Egyptian and irish affairs.   The lawyer, Cugino. is the principalorganizer of the league to liberate Ireland and Egyptfrom the British yoke.  The centre of tho movement isthought to be either in Geneva or Lausanne.The agitation to boycott the Milner Commission is increasing and there are indications that attempts willhe made to engineer a general strike when the commissionarrives.   The students are already threatening to come out although they have not yet returned to work.The Sultan has sent, through Prince Kamil Fazil,a message to Saad Pasha Z&amp;glovl. telling him to removeto Italy, as he is not satisfied with the attitude ofFrance.Kemaloddin has, with the concurrence of the Sultan,become a member of the Delegation.INDIA/
The people generally appear to have taken littleinterest In the Reform Bill now under&apos; consideration,but at the sam^ time it I3 considered that there is aIfeeling of satisfaction upon the reception which ithas received in England. , The internecine quarrels ofthe Indian deputations which have been sent to Englandare condemned by patriotic Indians.   The Bolshevik propaganda to bring about a revolution in India, withthe help of the Afghans, continues.   Some of theiragents are in Jerghana; the British authorities at ashgar have put several Bolsheviks under surveillance, and deported Others.   It is reported that K&amp;sim Beghas started a branch of his Society !TMuhammedanCommunists&quot; in Askabad.   This branch consists ofCaucasian Turks and the object of the Society isnominally the regeneration of Islam, but It has been admitted that its ieal intention&apos; Is to destroy Britishpower in the East as soon as India is considered ripe for revolution.   It is considered that the activitiesof Kasim Beg constitute a serious danger both In.Afghanistan and Persia, but that, If we command the caspian,Sea and hold a force in Khorasan, theBolsheviks, will refrain from military activity in persia and.will limit themselves to propaganda.   the amir of Bokhara is behaving well and it is reportedthat the Mullahs of Bokhara view Bolshevism withabhorrence.   They give no encouragement to Pan-Islamicor Afghan agitat ors.   It is suggests d that if Britishdiplomacy were directed to secure the independence ofBokhara,: with.the restitution to her of the Samarkandand Jizzak areas, and absolute autonomy for Transcaspiaand the remaining provinces of Turkestan, the adheranoeof all Central Asian Mahomme&amp;ans would be secured.
A Red Army conference was held at Samara and was attended by the Indian, Mission, which expressed itsadmiratiuo at the fact that Soviet Russia has establishedfreedom in the interests of the labouring classes.PERSIAIt is reported that the Persian Ambassador in constantinople, with the approval of Nationalists andPan-Islamic elements in Turkey, is urging the ex-Shahto regain his throne,   The ex-Shah is said to be inclined to do ae he is askod,in which case hewould re-appear on the scene as tho Chempion of Islam.A meeting has. been held at A.$kabad under Bolshevikauspices to discuss the Anglo-Persian agreement.   the persians were asked to combine with the Bolsheviks andthe people of the Caucasus in order to drive out theBritish from the holy places.   It was also proposedthat Persia should join the alliance, which, it was stated, had been concluded between Afghanistan,Turkish-Caucasus and the Bolsheviks to deliver Islamfrom slavory,CHINAIt is almost certain that there will be furtherdisturbances in China,   The Chinese are said to fear an invitation on the part of the Allies to the Japanese toreplace tho Chinese in Western Siberia, and if china is pressed to give up control of the Chinese EasternRailway to Japan, a patriotic agitation, on the scale of the Shantung, would at once begin.   The Governmentis unable to borrow abroad, and is financing its61f bydisastrous transactions in domestic bonds, bearing very high rates of interest.   The Government cannot pay thetroops/
troops who, in consequence, are beginning to pay&apos;themselves by looting.   Bolshevik propaganda continues,as is shown by tho fact that copies of two pamphletsIpublished by the South Seas Truth Society have latelyfallen into the hands of the Authorities.   This Societywas founded by Tok Schor to induce the Chinese to play their,part in the Universal Revolution.   Tok Schor isunder arrest in Singapore.A Communist organisation has been formed in Koreato raise troops to liberate the country from theJapanese.   The Bolsheviks affirm that a Red ChineseArmy, consisting of 200,000 men, has been formed in north China to fight the White Guards in Siberia0Some Bolshevik propaganda, emanating from Shanghaihas been found in Pokin and Tientsin.&quot; It is not muchmore dangerous than the Socialist literature which wascirculating fifteen years ago, but the seed now fallson more fruitful soil,CAKAJ6AThe general situation in Canada seems to be calm.The Dominion Trades and labour Congress has endorsed the action of tho United Steel Workers in support ofthe principle of collective bargaining.   It is reportedthat the Ocrgrsss also approved a resolution demandingthat no further assistance should be given to counter-revolutionary governments in Russiat&quot; The. annual convention of the Canadian Brotherhoodof Railway Employees adopted a resolution declaringthe One Big Union movement to be detrimental to theinterests of the working people and particularly ofthe railway workers.SOUTH AFRICAAt a meeting of the Nationalist Party held atCape to v$

It i^ considered that this movement isprobably being organized in sympathy with the more advanced movement in Iiflia.WM INDIESTho colour question in the -Won Indies is causing considerable uneasiness and certain responsibleresidents in Trinidad have addressed a memorial to theColonial Secretary, in which they attribute the presentdiscontent emong the negroes to tho general labourunrest, to the revolutionary ideas which the returnedWest Indian soldiers have absorbed during their stayoutside the Colony, and to the seditious tone of the&quot;Ar 0s&quot; newspaper.   The Authorities, whilst admittingthat there is a disorderly element among- the population,consider that the Mwri;l is unnecessarily alarming.A p^eci.:l Session of the Legislative Council inJwica has been called to pass emergency legislation to prevent, for three years, the entry of enemy aliensinto the Colony without the permission of the colonial secretary.AUSTRALIA/
AUSTRALIAReports indicate that tho unrest is being fanned byBolshevik agitation.  Many of tho leaders openly declare that they aim at Sommqnism.   This is confirmed hy thotone of the now Australian revolutionary press.   Duringtho recent seamen1a strike at Melbourne, nhioh wasengineered by militant Irishmen, a man namod  0 Corau issaid to have declared, that ho and his ohief, Walsh, theSecretary of tho Seamen *s Union, would he the Leninand Trotsky for Australia,  Propaganda is being carriedon by Russian Bolsheviks as woll as Irishmen.   On thoother hand, many of tho mm in tho Mercantile Marineresent Walsh1s leadership, and tho demobilised soldiersseem to be on the side of law and order.  At tho recentLabour Oonferonce in Sydney, tho Bolshevik members were asked to resign from the Labour Party.   They arenow formirg a separate Party under the leadership ofWallace, of the Miners1 Federation.UNITED STATES OF ATOICATho PresidontS Party is reported to have losthope of being able to do more than defeat thOamendments to the Peace Treaty and reduce tho scopeof the amenamezits proposed by the Republican Sectionof the Foreiga Relations Committee.   This attitude maybe duo to a change of feeling towards the Treaty onthe part of some of the Presidents adherents, andpartly to the lack of enthusiasm evoked by thePresident^ speech during his tour.The industrial situation appears to be full of unrest.   In the middle of September the Federation ofLabour reported that there were 2,000; strikes, eithergoing on or imminent.   This, of Gourse, is not surprising in so large a country.   The strike amongthe/
(Foreign)tho steel workers continues and, as is usual in America,there has boon&apos; rioting.   Mao.1, of the unrest Is believed to bo due to J3*:tremist agitation.   A oolloe raid atErst YoTuigstown, Ohio,&apos; on the premises used by theUnion of Runsion Worsen, led to tho discovery oflarge quantities of revolutionary propaganda.   Politicalagitation is being carried on by foreigners fmd membersof the Industrial Workers of the World in Unionshitherto regarded as Oor^ervative.   How nuch of thisunrest is due to reaction from the war and the high cost of living cannot be estimated, but It has beensuggested that, as soon as an A-erioan workman obtainedwages which allowed him to buy a motor-car, he spenthis substance in luxuries, without thinking that thecost of nocessitios had gone up in proportion.   Thedanger in the Eastern and Middle-Wost States seems to lie in the readiness with&apos;which foreign labour succumbsto Extremist agitation.   But for tho foroigners, thepresent   Labour crisis might have been tided over,but it Is now realised that unless the cost of livingoan be reduced or some radical chango effected in theindustrial fabric, the Extremists may force tho hand.   of the loaders or organized labour.   Apparently........ ^nationalisation is favoured by the coal miners, andthe nationalisation of. railways is a main plank inthe Labour Party platform.The German-Americans have revived the old Allianceunder the title of &quot;The G-erman-American Citizens1League of America,&quot; ?nd are working hard for thorehabilitation of the German name and for the overthrow of British influence.   The Loague will workon political lines, but not with any of the existingParties/
Parties.   It is opposed to the league of Nations, andis appealing to Congress against the Poaeo Treaty.   Ithas, at present5 no loss than seven ty Oluhs andSocieties,   Many prominent Gorman-Americans would prefer to oil ny on thoir propaganda loss openly, andthey advocate co-operation with the Irish and otheranti-British elements,   They are said to he using thecharitable funds colls otod for the distressed classes in Germany for propaganda,Thero appears to be no Bolshevism in the Army,and the controversy with regard to bonuses fordemobilised sol&amp;iors will probably result in a largerbonus being granted,\   The emigration of aliens, chiefly natives of SouthEastern Europe, continues.   900,000 have left Americasince the Armistice, carrying with them an average insavings of 3;000 dollars ,apiece.   Their departure hasled to an acute shortage of labour.SOUfEE AMERICAArgentinelahour troubles are by no means settled, but forthe time being political calm prevails, and, providedthat tho prices of raw foodstuffs oontinue to rise,tliore is ho reason to anticipate any immediatedisturbances,It is reportod that the Japanese havo a numberof agents in Buenos Aires for the studying of eommerceand propaganda.   They appear to be working closely with well known German agents.   The Japanese are on very friendly terms with the German and Mexicanlegations

The Gorman Chamber of&apos; Oommeroo is gala. . to have accepted a soorot proposal from tho JapaneseChamber, of Commence to -co-operate with it in resistingAmerican and British competition.......   The &quot;Red Flag&quot; newspaper has he en suspended forpublishing articles advocating violence, and the twopitqrs have boon sentenced to six years * imprisonment,with loss .of civil rights. , t . rBrazil....   According to reports in the press a jointconvention will be arranged botween Brazil, argentine and Uruguay to prevont the immigration of undesirablepersons.   There is no doubt that Bolshevism has made- some progress in Brazil and the authorities arcroported, in view of recent labour disturbances, to. ho keenly alive to the, danger,of allowing foreiga&apos; Iitctromists to.enter the country.The   loaders of tho conspiracy against thePresident were given their choice of standing theirtrial or of being deported. &apos; They chose the&apos; latteralternative, and have left Pera&apos;,   The rise of an organised labour Party in&quot;Peru is now beginning tomake itself felt.   The present leaders of the partyare working men, but the moment is imminent when menof intellect will endeavour to secure the leadership.The spirit of the movement is reported to berevolutionary, and already a desiro has boon expressedfor the establishment of a Soviet Government.   Theleaders of the party Bupport this policy and are endeavouring to formulate a Maximalist programme and to support the Bolshevik creed.    The general strike/
(foreign ^i) tatriko In  Lima and Calla, during the summer, is&apos;supposed to have been engineerod by immigrants fromBuenos Airee and Chile, who were connected with theBoropean revolutionaries,   The assumption of office by the new President,Lep;uta, who is aaid to be extremelypopular, and the wise manner in which he has handledthe question of profiteering has cut away the mainplank of the revolutionaries, the cause of the labourunrest being mainly economic.There is much Labour unrest and 10,000 workmenare idle.   So far, there has been no general strike,%ut it is said that Chilean Bolshevists are trying tofoment one.BrowTho Government of Uruguay has discovered proofsof an anarohiBt plot to organise revolutionary strikes.The Maritime Workers1 Federation was mainly involvedin the plot and has now been closed by the police.MEglCOMexico 0ity is repcrbed to be infested with streetrobbers, with whom the inefficient and underpaid police force cannot cope.
