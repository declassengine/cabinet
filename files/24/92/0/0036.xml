It is important to realize the effect of the measures outlined in G T. 8309     121upon the administration of the various departments, and the machinery of the State as Transporta whole. 1715This will vary according as transport, shipping and storage form an important orinsignificant element in the work of the department.2. As regards the War Department, storage, shipping and railway transportconstitute a considerable factor in organization. Troops have to be fed, clothed andmoved both in the United Kingdom and throughout the Empire.Apart from consumption of food and petrol and similar consumable stores, theWar Department has to keep clothing not only for curreut needs, but also for a limitedwar reserve, and also a certain quantity of other stores similar to those used by thegeneral civilian public. But in addition to this the War Department has to keep a very large quantity of military stores such as guns, telescopic sights, rifles, spare parts, &amp;c, quite apart from ammunition. These stores have a very high replacementvalue though a comparatively low disposal value. Many of them deteriorate quicklyif not adequately cared for, and are very expensive to move or handle even by road.The only economical method of dealing with these stores is with a clear programme,so that handling and movement and cost of adequate storage are reduced to a minimum;and this is only possible when the department responsible has fixity of tenure of storage accomodation and a comparatively free hand in dealing with the movements.3. The arrangements outlined in Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Memorandum of 13th October,give neither the necessary fixity of tenure, nor do they give the necessary liberty inregard to movement. Unless the public money is to be wasted, the powers proposed inthe memorandum will have to be limited in fact or in their exercise by the Ministry ofTransport.4. The general theory has been recently somewhat actively canvassed that economy and efficiency in administration can be attained by taking away any function which is common to two or more departments, and concentrating it in its various aspects underthe control of another department.This theory may hold good to a certain extent from an administrative but not from an economical point of view in abnormal circumstances such as obtained during a big war; but it entirely ignores the fact that efficient administration must befundamentally organic, and that in normal times of peace the State is too large andmany sided for the theory to be applied strictly.The problem is no new one. The arrangement now proposed is that which existedprior to the Crimean War and which led to continual waste before, and disaster during,that war.Then, as now, all functions such as transport were in a department outside theWar Department. Storage was also controlled outside the War Department. In both cases, the War Department indented on an outside body.It was found then, and the same situation will arise under the proposed arrange-ments, that the division of responsibility results in disorganization, continualcorrespondence, waste of public money and comparative chaos.5. It is suggested that at any rate as regards the Service departments, soundadministration is more likely to be attained by co-operation between departments and(B19/495)   90   tl/19  H&amp;S  KWwo
placing upon each department the responsibility of economical and reasonablemanagement of all branches in its concern, rather than by giving plenary powers on one subject to a single department with limited interests and necessarily limitedknowledge of the factors. The plenary powers are unnecessary if the result can beobtained by interdepartmental arrangements. These powers will lead to friction,confusion and waste of public money if exercised without the consent of otherdepartments materially affected, and further, they will tend to destroy the responsibilityof heads of departments for the economic and efficient management of their department as a whole-an essential basis of sound administration.6.: It is frankly recognized that the real basis of support for the present proposalslies briefly in the desire to emphasize the altered perspective consequent on the change from war to peace.During the war, everything had to be subordinated to naval and military requirements. Now the main interest of the State lies in building up civil life ofthe country and re-establishing civilian prosperity.. But as regards the service departments, this, it is suggested, can be attained more economically and effectually by conference, and the preparation of an agreed and wellthought out programme, giving due consideration to all the factors.This would give a sound and certain basis on which the Service departments couldwork, and would meet all the legitimate civil requirements. At any rate, it is submitted that this should be tried before resort is had to the heroic methods proposed.In conclusion, it should be added that the process of conference has been constantlygoing on since the Armistice, and that (a.) No transit sheds at docks are used for storage by the War Department,(6.) No case of rolling stock being held up by the War Department has beenbrought to notice.
