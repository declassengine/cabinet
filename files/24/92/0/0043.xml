DISPOSAL 0? iUia^ITS SEOi&amp;S IN FRANCE.BREACH OP ASanaCJNJ 3Y TH&apos;;j] WMQli UINIoCT 03? RdCOlJSEITOION(Memorandum from the Minister of Munitions).. r. . -ions situation has arisen in France which, unless- h^&quot;qulejkly remedied will gravely retard the progress of disposalsin that Theatre,In June of this year sales of British surplus stocks to .private individuals were in progress.   The French at firstobjected to these sales, and eventually officially notified,through the Press, that they would not allow private individualstQ purchase British stocks.Colonel Prangey, representing the Minister of&apos;Reconstitutien Industrislle, then a.pur cached the Cstrais signerfor Disposals in Prance with a proposition that in a certainarea the French Government would become the purchasers of allsurplus stores and plant, the prices being fixed by the BritishGovernment*As a. result, on the 9th July an Agreement was enteredinto between the French Ministry of heconstitution Induetrielleand the Minister of Munitions under which the former Ministryagreed to take over all British stores and plant not requiredby the British Government situated in curtain clearly definedareas, prices being fixed by the British Government.   A copyof the Agreement is attached marked &quot;A&quot;&apos;,In order to ensure that this Agreement would be binding on the French Government a Proces   /erbal was drawn up &apos;on thesame day (copy attached marked &quot;B1T) in which the oous ijecretaire-dlEtat a la Liquidation des Stocks (IvUMorel) gives his consent to an Agreement being entered into between General Grofto-n!Atkins and Colonel Prangey for the transfer of steres of theEritish depots situated in a defined area,.Before signing the Agreement General Orofton Atkins,representing the Minister cf Munitions, specially agreed-1-. with
1 , 2with Colonel. Prangey, ropresenting^llJjOuch^Tir, that the stores and material referred to therein should not include certainstores, viz, motor transport and the   Director General ofTransport1s assets, the latter of which oould not he dealtwith by either   party.She Agreement has now &quot;been in operation for over threemonths, and in strict accordance with its provisions some120 dumps have been taken over by the 1&apos;ronoh, and until the20th October no question had arisen as to its validity or tothe interpretation of its terms.On the 20th October a letter was received, dated 15thOctober, from the Ministry of Reoonstitution Industrielleinforming the Commissioner for Disposals in France that orders had been given to the French Reconstruction representatives to stsp all action under the Agreement, and the letter furtherstated that Colonel Prangey reserved to himself the right ofrevising the whole of the prices inserted on the lists fortransfers which had already been signed.   ( copy attachedmarked ,TCn).Colonel Prangey further suggested that he had now noobjection to the British Government selling stocks direct to individuals, whether manufacturers or otherwise,[The only reasons stated by Colonel Orangey for thiscomplete reversal of his former policy were that he hadneither the personnel to take over and guard the material, northe money to pay for it0die whole case has been referred to the Treasury -Solicitor, whose full opinion is attached marked &quot;D&quot;.   In this the &apos;2reasury Solicitor states that the Agreement is     /binding on both Governments, and advises that it would beto the detriment of the validity of that Agreement if we now accepted Colonel Prangey1s suggestion and sold stocks to private individuals.Representations were made by the Minister of munitions to the Foreign Office with a view to the question being taken-2- up
&apos;   263up with the French Government by the British Ambassador inParis (see co// attached marked &quot;1]&quot;).The British Commercial Counsellor in Paris has visitedcompetent officials at the offices of the. ministry ofReconstituteon Industrielle, M, Loueheur and Colonel Prangeybeing both away, and&apos; he was informed that the decision to cease taking over stocks was not taken by Colonel Prangey,.but by K.Loucheur himself*The main reasons given for the action taken, were that Colonel Prangey had no constitutional power, to bindthe office on behalf of the French Government to buy stocks which could be of no useful purpose to that office, andthat.the British Delegates understood at the time of signingthat the Agreement only meant that that office would take such stocks as they might choose (see copy attached marked &quot;P&quot;).Hot only is the latter statement entirely untrue butthe British Delegates more than once asked whether the Frenchwished to take everything (Motor Transport and director general of Transport Assets excepted) and the latter wereemphatic in their declarations that they would accept everythingwithout question,   Cn the constitutional point it v/ill be observed that Ivi. Korel, the Under Secretary of state for the liquidation of Stocks, covered the Agreement by the Proces Verbalof the same date (see the copy of a further telegram to lord derby marked &quot;G&quot;j.In these circumstances the Minister of munitions;&apos; stronglyrecommends that pressure be brought to bear upon the FrenchGovernment holding them to the terms of their Agreement by asuggestion to restrict the import of wool and coal into Prancein the event of their refusing to do so*3rd November, 1919,, IiIVERF0R&apos;2Ho

^ Y copy. &quot;D&quot;A MEMORANDJM Of COBFERENCE A? THETREASURY SOLICITORS OFFICE?on 22nd Ootober, 1919.ON QUESTIONS... WHICH HAVE ARISEN BETWEEN THE DISPOSALEG&amp;iD AND THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES.Present on behalf of the Disposal Board:-General Sir Orofton Atkins.Col.      Lindsay Lloyd.Mr. D. Neylan.and   Major Tudsbury.On behalf of the Sir Alexander Lawrence,Treasury Solicitor. and three other members of the Department.The documents considered were a letter of 15thOctober, 1919, from Col. Prangey to General Young and&apos;GeneralYoung&apos;s reply thereto of 20th Ootober, 1919, also the ProoesiVerbal *f a meeting held on 9th July, 1919 at.which were present:-Sir Crofton AtKins, General. 0annott of the Ministry of Munitions,and three representatives of the French Government includingM. Morel Under Secretary of State for. la liquidation,de Stocks andCol. Prangey himself,: representing the Ministry de la Reoonstitu-tion Industrielie, in Prance.The first paragraph of the prooes Verbal refers toanother Agreement in course of ^reparation. This Agreement wasalso considered.. It is dated 9th July,. 1919 and is signed bySir Crofton Atkins, General Cannot^ Col. prangey and anotherFrench Officer.   Tne Proces. is signed by the same officers andalso by M* Morel.On principals of English Law it seems quite olearthat the attitude taken up by Col., Prangey is not tenable.   Hecontends that the Agreement only applies to such stools as hemay wish to.buy. It seems quite clear from the text of theAgreement that it does in fact apply to the whole of the stocks in the various depots to which.it relates. except such stocks
as the British Authorities may choose to retain for their,-ownuse or to send back to England,   It appears that the agreement has already   been in operation for two and a half months and that from S5- to ZOfo of the stores have already been handed over.   InCol. Prangey&apos;s own letter it is admitted that.a considerable quantity of stores has already been, purchased.under the terms oftho Agreemente   The reasons given by Col, prangey for not   carryingout the Agreement in full are quite irrelevant and/merely relateto shortage of personnel and of.available fundseClause 6 of the Contract provides that the .prioes .shallbe fixed by the British authorities *   This provision was actuallysuggested by Colonel Prangey before tho Agreement was made ,and itis in accordance with the practice adopted by both the Britishand French&apos;authorities during the War in buying stores from one another.   In certain cases under the present Agreement when represent-ations have been, made by the French authorities that the price fixedwas too high the price has been   the subject of discussion betweenthe British-and Frenoh authorities and has been amicably adjusted.The Treasury Solicitor considers that under the present;circumstances it would not be advisable to act. upon the suggestion-made by Col. Prangey that the British authorities should resume the practice of selling to private individuals.   Since the Agree-ment was made no such sales have been effected except in some casesat.the.express request of the French authorities. If, however, thereshould be a long delay in settling the matter between the   foreignOffice and the French Ministry it may become neoessary to dispose of the stocks by sale.to private individuals in order to minimise the damage caused by the failure of the French Government to carryout the Contract.The Disposal Board,propose to ask the Foreign Officeto,make representations urgently to the French Government and underthe circumstances the Treasury Solicitor considers that this will-be the best course to adopt.A * U..

ArgentParis Ootober 26th 1319.No. 1225. .En clair by bag.Telegram from Lord Derby to Lord Curzon.Your telegram No. 1190 of October 24th. Refusal ofyranch &quot;Office de-Reconstltution Industrielle&quot; to take over stocksjovered by agreement of July 9th..   ..., . ...Monsieur loueheur is away and Colonel Prangey is11 in bed. Commercial Counsellor visited oompetent officialst Offide;s de Reeonstltution:; Industrielle and was informed that[decision to cease taking over stocks&apos;was not taken by Colonelrajigey on his own initiative but by Monsieur Loucheur himself.The contention is that the Ministry of Industrialeoonstruction does not consider that under the agreement theffice de Recohstitution Industrielle is obliged to take overhatever the British Authorities may offer. :    Agreement onlyeant that the Office would take over stocks which were afnterest to&apos; it1 s activities.     Mr. Addisoti&apos;pointed to the plainext of the agreement which contained no such&apos;reservation butas informed in reply that the situation was explained to theiritish&apos; delegates during&quot; ;t he negotiations and that... howeverfortunate the working of1 the agreement might &quot;be, the,; Britishlegates clearly&apos;understood at the time of signing that suchis the purport; of the agreement.A further point urged was that Colonel prangey onlyigned the&apos;-agreement as secretary general of the Office de &apos;  f   ...53onstituti&apos;6ii Industrielieiv&apos;&apos;/:* - -As such, he had no constitutionalpwer td- bifid- the:-office to &quot;buy stocks which could be of no . .\ .feful purpose to-that off ice ^:  - Even the Minister of Industrialconstruction could not have done sc.      The British Delegates &apos;ew in what capacity Colonel prangey was acting, and thisInstituted a further proof that they understood the limitedture of the- agreement.P.T.O.
Mr. itddison has spoken to competent officialat Ministry for Foreign Affairs who also said that theOffice de*Reconstitution Industrielle had no power to make an agreement to buy everything in certain areas.        Govern-ment Departments could only move within the limits assigned to them and consequently the agreement in so far as itexceeded the powers of the Office de Reconstitution Industrielleciust, in order to be binding, be concluded with the ministry for Foreign Affairs, the recognised channel for relationswith foreign powers, or with the Under-Secretary for the liquidation of Stocks, who had definite powers in such matters.In reporting these conversations I am not, ofcourse, expressing any opinion as to the truth or otherwise of the statement that the agreement was signed on the distinctunderstanding tht*t it only referred to stocks falling within&apos;the scope of the Office de Reconstitution Industrielle,Unfortunately however, the argument as to constitutional powersis correct and it would consequently appear to be almost impossible to persuade the Frenoh Government to order thatthe authorities should continue to carry out the agreement in strict accordance with the plain meaning of the text.Resides, representations would involve endless delays andproblem is a practical one requiring a practical solution.Suggestion was made to Mr. Addison that best way out ofthe difficulty would be1,     To make a fresh agreement specifying exactly the categories of stocks which the Office de ReconstitutionIndustrielle will take.Z.     To offer the rest to the Under-Secretary for the iliquidation of stocks in accordance with the procedurealready in force with regard to stocks not situated in the regions covered by the Agreement of July 9th, /It might be advisable to adopt this suggestion, sinceany other course would appear likely to lead to greater delays ina matter which does not brook delay.
/Disp/1775 (P.3.7)27&quot;Gr&quot;30th October 1919Sir 9I am directed by the Minister of munitions to refer to your letter of October 28th, 146049/VM7,forwarding a copy of a telegram U&apos;o. 1225 from Lord Derbydated October 26th, on the subject of the agreement withthe &quot;Office de Reconstitution Industrielle&quot; for taking over surplus stocks.I am to state in reply ihfct the Minister canin no way accept the statements and explanations givenby tho French Authorities, and to forward for the consid-eration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, afurther draft telegram by way of reply to the points raised in the telegram referred to above, with a request that, if Lord Curzon approves,, this telegram may bedispatched to Lord Derby with the least possible delay.I h: ye the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(SSD) HaH. ?IGGrOTT*The Under Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,Foreign Office,
1   273ghtiiGBAM TO LORD, PflRBY   Pi JOS .Your telegram Wo.1225 dated 26th October.    The statement by the Office de Reconstitution Industrielle that the british delegates understood at the time of signing that the x-greementonly meant that that Office would take such stocks as theymight choose to take is not well founded.     On the contrarythe British Delegates especially asked whether the ReconstitutionIndustrielle desired a schedule of the stores to be taken over,and the reply of the French Delegates was tin t this was whollyunnecessary as they wished to take over everything the BritishGovernment did not require for their ov.n purposes.     GeneralCroft on Atkins thereupon agreed to their taking over everythingexcept motor transport and railway assets as it was not within his power to offer these to the French.     Before signing theagreement the British Delegates definitely asked ColonelPrangey himself whether he had full powers to negotiate on .behalf of his Ministry in the absence of L.loucheur, and ColonelPrangey emphatically stated that he was acting with the full authority of this liinister.     Im the proces   verbal of the 9thJuly covering the Agreement the Under Secretary of State forthe liquidation of Stocks gave his assent to the handing over of the British dumps to the Linistry of Reconstruction, and colonel Prangey signed the same proces verbal as representingthe Minister of Reconttraction.     The necessity for thesanction of M. korel, who had definite: powers in these matters,was known at the time to the British Delegates and his agreement was consequently secured as stt-ted above.  , lb regardsthe French statement that the agreement to be binding should be concluded with the Linistry for Foreign affairs it must be pointed out that there are several other Agreements for.&apos;thedisposal
&apos;   280disposal. ofvsurplus-at ores which have-heeir made -with and arebeing carried out by French- Government departments, and in no case have these departments- suggested that the agreements should be mede with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.     In thesecircumstances   His lu&quot;ajeety*s Government feel bound to insist onthe full recognition of tho agreement.     They are not preparedto adopt the suggestion of making a fresh agreement with there constitution Indus urielle on the lines inclioated in the telegramunder reply.     You should therefore press; the French Governmentagain with the further information now conveyed to you to instruct their authorities to oarry out the Agreement in its entiretyand thus .put an end to a situation that is rapidly becomingintolerable.30th October, 1919.
