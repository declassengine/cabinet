The position ofvon der Goltz&apos;s troops in courland, which is at present o copyingthe attention of the Allied and Associated Governments and theirDelegations in Paris, is described in Berlin as having been a source of great anxiety to the German Government.    A Memorandumof the Political Intelligence Department (No. 582, October 2nd) hasalready dealt with the relations between the Baltic States andGermany since the Armistice of the 11th November, 1918, and with theproceedings of the German and Russian or quasi-Russian forces atpresent In courland and Lithuania.     It is the attitude and actionof the German Government as described by themselves towards these forces that needs further investigation.The forces under von der Goltz, the VI Army Reserve Corps,doubtless took advantage of the general confusion In Germany duringthe first months after the Revolution to establish for themselves a kind of independence, which it would   have been very difficult for the German Government to restrict, even if that Government had\been perfectly sincere in its efforts to restrict it.     It is main-I tained in Germany, by way of excuse, and it has recently been
reaa-s^nrte^iJiHJ^ of the Allied and.Associated Powers is inconsistent, since the original desire whichthey expressed was that the German forces remaining in the terri-tories of the former Russian Empire should co-operate in fighting the Rolshevihs.     An alleged &quot;Order&quot; elated as late as August 23th,(ax)19193 and &quot;signed by ,the British Brigadier-General harsh&quot; was issuedthat all troops on the front from Narva to a bout 50 ICilometresfrom Dvinsh, including the troops c.r. Colonel Avalodd-B ermondt (now( XXX)assaulting Riga) should attach. The British General, it is main-tained, was well aware that numerous German soldiers who had Ion;;been in the Russian service, were among Colonel Avalodf -Bersandt&apos;sforce and no objection was made to their presence. It is alleged that General harsh even Informed Colonel AvalofI-Bermondt that &quot;noobjection would be made to Germany1s continuing to provide for his(Bermondt&apos;s) troops.&quot;It seems incredible that any such order or even suggestionshould have been made by an Allied officer on august 26th, as notesdomandin;, the withdrawal od the German forces had. been addressed tothe German Government on June loth, August 1st and.   August 24th,The sources od information as to the attitude of the GermanGovernment towards von der Goltz:s force are partly od a character which mahes it very difficult to place much reliance upon them.The Independent Socialists are determined to discredit a Governmentin which the majority Socialists are the leaders by representing itas smoothing the path for reaction in. Germany and in Russia, and asat the same time embroiling Germany with the Allied, and Associated(x) German direless No. 297, October 13th, 1919.(xx)   Of General Cough&apos;s Military hission.(xxx) Ldlddle of October, 1919.
I Powers.     Polish propaganda is also employed in order to support theV jiew that Gerpany is workinr. for an understanding with a future re--actionary regime in Russia - a development which would be ominousfor the future of Greo.tcr Poland, caught as it would be betweenU)the upper&apos;German and the nether Russian millstone..    The Poles arefavourable to the proposal put forward by Marshal   Foch at theMeeting of the Delegations of the &quot;Jive Great Powers on Septemberi 17th, that the Polish Army should be used to expel the Germans fromLithuania and courland.    M, Clemenceau stated at that meeting that the Poles had notified that they had an army of 450,000 &quot;men..The objection successfully advanced by the   American Delegate, Mr.Polk,, that armed Polish intervention in the Baltic provinces would cause the hostilities which had been suppressed with great difficultyin Upper Silesia to break out afresh,and that it would lead to warbetv/een Germany and Poland, is net one which would greatly appealto the eager Polish propagandists.The German Independent Socialists simply assert that the Govern-1ment has been insincere in its pretence of restraining and with-drawin;. von der Goltz&apos;s troops;, that it has continued t&apos; connive atrecruiting for these forces in Berlin and ether German centresj andthat it has not used the only -rears o:;: enforcir/-; its orders for with-drawal - the stoppage of &quot;pay, food supplies and munitions of war..It was even reported that the attempt on the life of the IndependentSocialist leader, Haase,. on October 3th, was not unconnected with his::) Cf.   The Note Verbale from the Polish Government regarding the gravity and extent of the German military preparations, transmitteab^ Sir Percy tfyndham from Warsaw on September 20th, 1919, No. 13350,25th September,, 1919.    The figures which the Poles give - 700,OouGerman troops concentrated at Spandau etc.*-are absurd.
-   4:   --   290intention of raising on that clay in the National Assembly thewhole question of the Baltic troops.     The Berlin correspondent ofthe &quot;Morning Post&quot; put the situation very plainly in the issueof Tuesday, October 14th (page .9) when he said:-The Independents are naturally pleased with theFoch Note, for it pro-notes their designs against theGovernment,. . The aim of the Independents is, ofcourse, to paralyse the efforts to bombat Bolshevism,for they aim&apos;at the establishment of a Soviet regime in G ermany in order that there may be no oppositionto their plan for comj/unisiir; the Fatherland.On the other hand and. simultaneously the German reactionariesand. Chauvinists desire to identify German opinion with the aggressivemovement of the German-Russian troops in the Baltic Provinces,believing that the Allied and Associated Powers cannot or will-not take military measures to prevent this movement, that the (re-act reactionary) salvation of Germany lies in the triumph of reaction in Russia with German aid if possible, that if war with Polandincidentally brohe out, it would result in a speedy German victory which would upset the Versailles peace, and,finally, that the chiefimmediate effect of Allied coercive measures on the West would be tooverthrow the present Ministry, with the result that, either directly or through popular risings followed by a dictatorship&apos;, the causeof reaction would triumph. 1 - ^Thus, even if the German Government had had a perfectly cleanbill as regards their treatment of von der Goltz&apos;s force, theirattitude, as tendenoiously represented in the press of their Germanultra-Socialists and their Reactionary adversaries, would wear a corn-promising aspect.As a matter of fact, however, the German Got ernment for one reason or another has been unable 6u unwilling - probably it has beenboth unable and unwilling - to deal firmly with von der Goltz andthe troops that were under his command.    There was from the first,owing to the fear of Bolshevist infection and the disturbed state ofGermany, great hesitation about rapidly withdrawing the forces whichhad been operating in Russia.     iiany c:. the men wore hnown to have
(x)   Reported by General Malcolm (P&apos;c. 132053, September 22nd, 1919).m   6   &quot;fraternised with the Bolsheviks, v;ho he.\ at first been allowed,cr even encouraged, by the Germans ot overrun a great part ofLatvia.     Subsequently, whe:.. the men heard of the bad conditions at home, many of the::1, shewed ::io desire to return and pinnedtheir faith to promises of land which were made to them by theBaltic landowners (!,B altio Barons!l) of German race,or by theLetts themselves during the German occupation of Riga (though this is denied by the present Lettish Prime Llinister, Ulmanis),and certainly by their own officers..    As for these officers, manyof them were known to be reactionary and to regard it as theirmission, first, to maintain in the Baltic lands a force whichcould ultimately intervene in Germany and restore the Monarchy;and, secondly, to restore something like the old rj^ime in Russiawith a view ultimately to a Russo-German political, military andeconomie alliance.After the Supreme Council had addressed various ultimatums onthe subject to Germany, hosks made a statement on the question of u)withdrawal in an interview with the German!a on September 5th.    he regarded the question of the troops in 0 our land as mainly economic.He explained ho;; the troops were working on the land and groupingthemselves for purposes ox colonisation.     He doubted if the Lettishforces without the aid of the Germans would be able to withstand theBolshevi-;: forces.     The Letts and the British believed that all wouldbe well once the evacuation of the Germans had taken place.     Theywould, perhaps, be disappointed i; this expectation.     Prom theGerman point of view the problem c* the defence of Hast Prussiawould arise.This statement of I!oske&apos;s was, of course, made at a time when theBolshevik menace was still regarded as formidable.     It was understood
iat, with a view to greater safety and the avoidance of internalisturbancc behind the backs of the defending force, tho Germanjvernment preferred that any stand which might have to be madegainst a Bolshevist advance should bo made some 50 or 60 milesist of the German frontier rather than upon that frontier.     It is,oreover, probable that Noske, who lias to humour the reactionaryeotion of the officers at home in order to keep them loyal, wasawilling to adopt very striir out measures in dealing with von cieroltz and his subordinates, with whose German and Russian aims theseeaotionary officers at home wore in active sympathy.It is this sympathy of the military and reactionary clausesn Germany that probably explains tho Impunity with which recruitingor von der Goltz&apos;s force went on even after the German Government,i response to the demands of the Allies, had announced its inten-ion.of withdrawing iliesc troopsi    The recruitment was partlyassian - prisoners and refugees - partly German.    A Russianfflcer, Lieutenant Popofx, was said to have an office in Berlin ando have represented the German authorities as countenancing his pro-edings and as b.ein.nr prepared to prosecute volunteers who desertedaid returned to Germany.     The Independent Socialist &quot;Freiheit&quot;sorted that not merely was recruiting conducted in secret on&apos; a smalllaic, but that high military quarters had their hands in the game,ae reserve section o:&apos;.* one of the detachments of von dor 0&apos;oltz&apos;sorce was still in the new camp at Doberitz, near Berlin, and sent   &apos; &apos;most every wee?.: troops and war material to Courland without thoightest difficulty bein; made.    The railway stations were theavouritc recruiting places.     Large transports to Courland obtained-ite openly the approval of the railway transport officers, smallerntingents travelled with false furlough passes.     Many troops wore)   &quot;Freiheit&quot;, September 20th, 1919.
iespatched in empty hospital trains.     These men were generallydescribed on the transport passes as &quot;escort1&apos;, but. once in 0 our land,hey remained there.    A further trick was to send insignificantupplies of material with large escorts.     These escorts also re-lained in Courland, which was gradually being converted into a;investigation:itic military camp.With regard to the despatch of supplies the i;Freiheit:: con-Tho forwarding of supplies and of war material is still in no way neglected.    Thus on Tuesday, September16th, at the Tempelhof Station alone 20 brand-new motor-cars, with four covered lorries, complete with tyres, canvascovers and spare parts, were entrained for Courland,     Thelorries came from Motor Dep&apos;6t No. 8 in the General Pape-Strasse.    The transport went first to Stralau-RummelsburgStation, where further materiel, apparently arms andammunition, was added.The soldiers made no secret to the station personnelthat the consignment of motor-cars was a great pTece*&apos;&quot;brsmuggling     They said the transport would first go toBreBlau, and thenoc by a circuitous route to Courland.We are informed that such transport has been of almostdaily occurrence during the last fortnight.    From this it can be estimated what enormous quantities of Germannational property are lost by this smuggling..;s has boon already pointed out, the testimony of the Independentsocialist &quot;Freiheit&quot;&apos; is somewhat suspect owing to its violent opposi-(1)don to the Government and its Bolshevist sympathies.     The &quot;Vorwarts&apos;,&apos;lovever, which is the organ of the governmental Socialists; con-armed the statements that large quantities of sup-olios wore roingio Courland and asserted that von dor Goltz&apos;s ar;;:y was costing atleast Ml:. 800,000 ( 40,000 pre-war) daily, an estimate which didiot appear excessive having regard to the great increase in theluantities of supplies forwarded.    The &quot;Vorwarts&quot; added:x)   &quot;Vorwarts&apos;&apos;&apos;, September 17th, 1919.     It must nevertheless boremembered that the &quot;Vorw&amp;rts&quot;, although governmental, is veryhostile to Noske, being a partisan of his personal opponent, thelate head of the Government, Scheidemann,
The Government, which, is fully informed ci Germany&apos;ssad financial situation and&apos;knows that we are steeringconstantly nearer the abyss, tranquilly watches theswindle that is being carried on by military quarters.It allows itself to be treated like dirt, because, inview of the great power which the officers have acquired,i; ) it does not venture to r-ialce an end of this procedure byenergetic intervention.-While $he German military authorities may have been connivingat the enlistment of recruits and the despatch of supplies, Russianreactionaries (the word does not necessarily carry a disparagingsignificance) who tool: refuge in Berlin, have been actively en-gaged in recruiting liberated Russian prisoners and other for vonder GoltzTs force and the detachments dependent upon it.    All kinds of reports have been circulated as to the financial resources at thedisposal of&apos; these Russians,and the name of the Grand Duke 0yril haseven been mentioned as one of the chief contributors.     The &quot;Frei-heit&quot; stated that Russo-German recruiting was still going on.Large numbers of non-commissioned officers and men were still going(xxx)north to join Bermcndt&apos;s force.      General Biscoupski had arrived in Berlin and was trying to organise all available forces &quot;against bolshevism&quot; in the Baltic States,   &apos; Biscoupski had come to anagreement with the Germans and  was to receive large sums of money from them.Finally, on October 7th, it was stated by the Berlin ultra-domocratic paper, Herr von Gerlach&apos;s &quot;Vdelt am Montag&quot;,that, accordingto a report from Liitau (von dor Goltzrs headquarters), a &quot;WostRussian&quot; Government ho/- been formed - according to later accountsformed in Berlin - with Biscoupski as President and Minister forForeign Affairs.(x)   Paper registered No. 129507.(xx) ,According to one acdount, Russians --of whom there are said to&apos;&quot;be some 40,000 to 50,000-in Berlin alone - have undoubtedlysupported Bermondt through the &quot;Russian Committee&quot; established in Berlin.      .(xxx):.Now attacking Riga.   October.
Other lists ox1 the members give alternatively Biseoupski (whois personally unimportant) and Count Constantin von dcr Pahlen(a Baltic Baron) as Presidents, and Durnovo (a Russian reactionary)1 vand Major-General Tschernilovbski-Sokal as Minister of War.Curiosit*T was-felt regarding the attitude ox the German government towards this,self-constituted &quot;Vest Russian&quot; kinistry.     It is re-\ported to have been first proclaimed by Colonel Bermcndt   (at Mitau)in order that he might have &quot;Some plausible means of utilising all sources o:&apos; taxation and supply in the districts occupied5&apos;.    Apparont-ly he intended to take immediate possession of Latvia and part ofLithuania.     General Hirgolitch at Shavli had disarmed the Lithuanianpopulation and had proclaimed his district to be Russian territory.The first financial effort of the &apos;&apos;lest Russian Government&quot; is described (by the Independent Socialists in their press) as havingbeen a ridiculous fiasco.A swindler o:.&apos;.&apos; the most astounding kind unier the nameof &quot;Director r.!oschell:: succeeded  or a time in imposingon the &quot;Russian Co.-.m it tee&quot; in Berlim as a representativeof J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and actually concluded agreements with General Biscoupski and his associates under the title of the &quot;west Russian Government1&apos; for a loan of Kk,500,000,00on a security of the &quot;total wealth of all territory under&apos;* . the present or future control o:: the ^Yest Russian Govern-ment&apos;,!.     Biscoupski a::.d his friends soon succeeded in dis-covering the swindle.     although &quot;Losehell&quot; has hadstrange dealings with the.Independent Socialists at various times, it seems that his original idea was to use this document as a means ox imposing on people for further and more lucrative swindles, and that he only finallygave it to the Independents as a weapon in their cam-paign against the Government.(x)   Bermondt, who has been trying to take Riga (middle of October) with, a force described as Russian but really consisting largely oftroops from von der Goltz&apos;s 8orps, is said to be a Cossack Colonelof some military experience, who organised a volunteer force against the Bolsheviks at Kieff in 1918.     On the withdrawal ofthe Germans from the Ukraine he was arrested and sentenced to death but escaped.    His wife is said to have been killed by theBolsheviks at Petrograd.     His real name is Prince Avalod?^- iBermondt, and he is described, as a ?;ealthy landowner of Finland(&quot;Morning Post&quot;, &quot;Stockholm Telegram&quot;, October 16th, 1919).
This incident probably explains the reports which have beencurrent as to the &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; which were at ColonelBermondt!s disposal, and It mr:y also account&apos; for a reference to&quot;financial negotiations&quot;&apos;1 in one -o&quot; von der Goltz&apos;s proclamationsand to a statement by another   of the military leaders in 0ourland,Siewert, that economic reconstruction there was to be carried onvigorously by 11 German, neutral and American industry and finance&apos;&apos;.This Siewert, a German naval Captain, is described in the german press as the officer in command of the section of von der GoltzfsCorps which, under the name of the &quot;German Legion&quot;, went over tothe Russo-Gcrman force under Colonel Bermondt, known as the SellerCorps.     Siewert!s proclamation to his men informed them that they/ould receive Russian pay, but at rates not lover than the german army with continued family allowances.     They would be oubjeot tothe Russian military regulations, but flogging would be forbidden.They would be entitled to become Russian subjects when the campaignwas concluded and to establish themselves in existing Germansettlements or elsewhere.    The leaders were negotiating for a freegrant of 80 morgen of land to each settler, and the troops werefurther promised a share in the profits of certain industrial enter.prises.now being organised in Russia, in which not only the German,&quot;but also the Russian, the neutral and the American trade andU)financial worlds&quot; were interested.As to the question of German financial support for Bermondt!sFree Corps&apos;, it is alleged on yood authority that the German &quot;heavyindustry55 through a finance bureau in Berlin has contributed a gooddeal to the German &quot;Free Corps&quot;.     A man, until recently in. a highposition in the Steel Syndicate, estimated that the sum may well have totalled two or three hundred millions of marks (pre-war 10,000,000 to  15,000,000).     Many of the leaders of &quot;Free Corps1&apos;(:-.) This proclamation was published b?&quot; the reactionary Berlin&quot;XCreuzzeitung&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;. Reproduced in &quot;The Times&quot; ofOctober 7th.
(::)- . &quot;The Times&quot;, October -18th.thus --en^we^Joad.--taken part in the Baltic adventure.     But it wasimpossible to say lion much of the sums in question has been diverted thither.    Furthermore, the Baltic Barons had contributedsome millions.    Eere again the division of the proceeds betweenvon der Goltz (or Individual &quot;director Corps&apos;1 under him) and Bermondtis uncertain.     All available information tends to show thai: ifBer. -ondt has large suits at his free disposal (which may be doubted),these do not co&quot;me from the German Government.     Even their bitterestopponents, the Independent Socialists, say that, if any large sumshad beCn diverted&quot; to this purpose, they could certainly have dis-covored it.     On the other hand, it is regarded as quite possible thata tentative financial agreement may exist between Bermondt andcertain German&apos;financiers, not, indeed, placing a large loan atBermond^s free disposal, but giving him. the prospect of support inthe measure in which he &quot;makes good&quot; and can offer a quid pro quo(possibilities of economic activity in any lar;e section, of Russia etc.)Attempts have been made in Berlin to represent von der Coltzas having tried his best tc withdraw his troops or to keep them inhand pending their withdrawal.     Ee was on one occasion at leastsummoned to Berlin in order to give explanations and receive in-structions.     Ultimately, on the ground that his endeavours to per-persuade his troops to withdraw has proved successful, he was recadledand a General Eberhardt appointed in his stead.     Von der Goltz isU)reported   to have recently addressed a message to the soldiers of theformer Sixth Reserve Corps in the &quot;West Russian Army&quot; in which hethanks them for their heroism before Riga.    Re added that, although he had been removed by the German Government from his position as general commanding this Corps, he would still do all in his powerto provide for his old soldiers.    Further, in a letter to Colonel
Bernwttidt he congratulated him upon the &quot;V/eet Eussian Army&apos;s&quot;sueoessds before  Riga &quot;where,&apos; for the first time for over aeenturyj German and Russian trcopB fought side by side0&apos;&apos;Major Bischoff, who ooaimands the so-called KIrcn Divls-ion&quot; if General Goltz&apos;s forde, had issued on October 5th axproclamation^ in which he openly defied the Allied and Asso-ciated powers.    He declared that the &quot;Iftitento-s threat&quot; oughtn*t to frighten them, that their yoilding would not help thehorns country, and that the same game would begin again after a fsw days.   &quot;Everything the Entente says is1 lios&quot;, he wenton, &quot;except when it openly expresses its intention of extir^pating the German nation be all means, including the mostimmoral.n    Hajsr Biochoff announced his intention of help-ing the Russians by placing the country conquered by the (,lron-Division&quot; under the Bussian flag,     &quot;you know that I ama German to the last drop of my bleed;&quot; he added4 &quot;soyou Will believe me when I tell you that ycu oan   followme on this path without scruples, and that while I helpour friends; I will work laOre for Germany also&quot;.$he independent Socialist &apos;&apos;Ji\eibc.it&quot; oven asserted thatvon der Goltz himself had issued a secret general order tothe following effect.     (This must have been early in flept-embsr):-In spite of existing difficulties, I con-sider it wrong for individual leaders to spreadpropaganda against entering the Russian ser-vice.      It is very important that inK   &quot;flafflicho Rundschau&quot;, quoted in the ,;The IMmes&quot;, October 9th,kk Reported by General kalcolm in Report ITo* 20 Reg, Ho. &apos;*   129507.. 16th September,, 1919,

In the blackest colours and the troops are being kept in the belief that famine and unemployment prevail in Germany. The enlightenment of these men is so far impossible, since only the Tagliche Rundschau (reactionary), and similar papers are to be bought in Mitau.

The correspondent added that individual officers would like to return to Germany but that the troop commanders who were solely to blame, would not give them permission. If they left without permission they would run the risk of being treated as deserters, and they did not know how they would be received at home. The troops were not likely to experience difficulties as regards supply or pay because their resources had been increased for months past and emergency funds had been created sufficient for some two months ahead. Should the German Government desire to enforce the evacuation of the Baltic Provinces, care must be taken that its orders were communicated to the troops.

The German Wireless itself (on October 8th) reported a manifesto which had been issued by the “German Volunteer Corps now in Courland” in which it expressed its intention to continue in the Baltic Provinces its defence against Bolshevism, since it “esteemed the dictates of conscience higher than enforced commands”.

7. Meanwhile, the German Government and the Minister of Imperial Defence, Herr Nosko, had been constrained by the action of the Supreme Council in Paris to take more decided measures. Herr Nosko issued orders not later than October 4th to the effect that the troops of the Sixth Reserve Corps should immediately be brought back to the region of Schaulan*

* Shavli was then in the occupation of Virgolitch with a force of some 5,000 men, largely Germans. Virgolitch is said to acknowledge the authority of Bermondt.


(Shavli in Lithuania) Whence the transport of all troops to Germany would be arranged. No further pay was to be given to any who fail to observe marching orders. Transfer to the Russian service was forbidden and was henceforth ,made punishable. Germans already transferred are to be summoned to return to their regiments.

A proclamation by the German Government to the troops stationed in the Baltic States was issued on October 4th and called their attention to the fact that "the Entente" threatened Germany with the resumption of the blockade, the stoppage of credits and a refusal to supply raw material. The occupation of Frankfurt was also threatened. All this was because a part of the German Baltic force would not withdraw from a foreign country in spite of the orders of their Government. By this "criminal obstinacy" the danger of unemployment for millions and of famine next winter was brought very near, and, in fact, the disobedience of a few thousands was endangering the lives and welfare of 60,000,000 people. It was true that the conditions upon which the troops were recruited, the promise of grants of land, had not been kept, and their indignation on this ground had been explained to "the Entente". Nevertheless the troops must obey the Government&apos;s orders "for the sake of the nation.

Nosko himself spoke out very strongly on several occasions. In a speech delivered towards the end of September* he declared that he would have every man fired on who attempted to reach the Baltic Provinces. Discussing the last Note of the Supreme Council in the Main Committee of the National Assembly he said that the German Government was making every effort to fulfill its obgligations. The Courland frontier had been closed to

*German Wireloss, Oct. 1.

 
all troops. Von der Goltz had been recalled. The German troops in Courland did not number more than 20,000 (certainly an under-estimate). The chief difficulty was to get at the 5,000 who had entered "Russian" Service.

Meanwhile the German Press enlarged upon the last-mentioned difficulty and doubted whether the German Government had the right to order the withdrawal of individuals who entered the "Russian" Army, as these individuals were no longer under the operation of German military law.

It has already been seen in what sense the force of Colonel Avaloff-Bermondt could be called "Russian". Indeed this force has recently been expressly disowned by General Yudenitch in command of the North Western Russian Army. Avaloff-Bermondt, who had not obeyed General Yudenitch&apos;s instructions to join him by sea, was denounced by Yudenitch as a traitor. And it is now stated that Yudentich has presented the Lettish Army with a number of guns - to be used, evidently against Avaloff-Bermondt&apos;s force.*

The German Government&apos;s reply on October 4th to the Supreme Council&apos;s Note of September 28th, stated that supplies and ammunition for them had been held up, and that General von der Goltz had been replaced by General Eberhardt. The German Government thought that the Allied and Associated Governments must admit that it "Has no further means of military compulsion at its disposal"

This last assertion is undoubtedly true. All the troops under arms in Germany are required for the maintenance of public order, and, even if it were not so, to send fresh troops to coerce their comrades in Courland would be like trying to cast out Satan by Beelzebub.

*Telegram received at Copenhagen on October 18th, from the Lettish Prime Minister, M. Ulmanis, and transmitted by Reuter.



   
The Chancellor, Herr Bauer, spoke in the same sense in the Reichstag on October 7th. In a speech that was, perhaps, somewhat too lachrymose, he said: 

Already before the arrival of the (Supreme Council’s) ultimatum the Imperial Government had taken decisive measures and had communicated them to the Entente. The ultimatum nevertheless came, with the terrible threat of the inhuman blockade – and this almost at the very moment when the French Chamber was ratifying the Peace of Versailles. Has ever a peace been concluded at the moment of such a declaration of war as this? Can this be called a conclusion of peace? The Imperial Government has entered the strongest protest against the application of such inhuman measures of war to a civilian population.

Coming as near as, apparently, he could to the point at

issue, Herr Bauer continued:-

I repeat this protost in order to establish in the hearing of the whole world, hardened as it is to the miseries of war, the plain fact that because outside tho sphere of the power of the Republic, - which by every possible method has been rone" or cd impotent in a military sense,-Gorman mercenaries havo pursuod their"policy of adventure - for this reason German wome/jana children aro again to have the strangle-hold put upon tho meagro portion of fats and milk which our impoverished Fatherland oan buy beyond its frontier. That was not the conception which wc had formed of the League of Nations.3 5

It has beon necessary to italicise the explanation given

by the German thonoollor of the position of von der Goltz&apos;s

iorce and tho attitude of tho German Government towards it,- as

ho thought fit to wrap up his references to this&apos; subjoct in a

denunciation of tho Allied and Associated Powers&apos; threats. Even

so, the speech was violently interrupted by the Right and the i

National liberals, and it is evident that the Government finds

it very difficult to speak out where military pride or patriotic

sentiment i s touched.

^oxt of Horr Baucr&apos;s speech from German Wireless, Oct.8th,1919,
The Imperial Minister of Defence was somewhat more outspoken when on the following day he denounced Major Bischoff&apos;s proclamation of October 5th to the "Iron Division" in Courtland. ? Noske declared that "Major Bischoff&apos;s proclamation, urging has troops to stay in the Baltic Provinces, passed all bounds in insub-ordination and that a court

-martial inquiry would be opened."

Finally, General Malcolm has sent a report ? of a conversation which he had with Neeke at the latter&apos;s request on September 25th. Noske regretted the difficulty which the German Government had in laying its views directly before any Entente Government. Although it was made clear to him that the British Military Missien in Berlin had nothing to do with the Baltic regions, he read the following points:-

(a) That the German Government was really doing its best to induce the troops to withdraw from the Baltic Provinces. An officer had now been sent to von der Goltz to inform the troops that unless they complied. pay and supplies would be stopped; 

(b) That, in spite of this, he was afraid that the troops, would refuse to withdraw, and that the General Government would be held responsible.

Some of the troops being without money or food, would disperse and start ?oting;

(c) That, if the German troops did withdraw, there would still be 7,000 Russian troops without pay, who would also be a danger. These have also hitherto been paid by the German Government; this is to stop on the 30th September;

(d) That in consequence of the fear of these disorders, some 150,000 (i.e. residents) now in the Baltic Provinces would leave for East Prussia and would be promptly followed by the Red Armies;

(e) That a request had been received from Versailles for permission to send an Inter-allied Commission to the Baltic provinces to investigate conditions on the spot. Such a Commission was welcome to the German Government.

Meanwhile, General von der Goltz has returned to Berlin, where he arrived on October 18th. The reception with which he met is very significiant. The Government could not help

censuring his farewell message of congratulation to Colonel Bermondt X, but its public announcement of the censure was in mild terms:-

The Cabinet had deliberated on the telegram which General von der Goltz sent to Colonel Bermondt. The Government strongly disapproves of the telegram, and only refrains from taking proceedings against the General ... because he has already tendered his resignation.XX

Various Berlin newspapers publish this communiqué under the heading "No disciplinary measures against von der Goltz".

The Berlin Press at the same time gives prominence to a message of warm thanks addressed to von der Goltz by Lieutenant-General von Estorff, now in command at Stettin, the headquarters of the newly-organised Northern Group of the new German Army. General von Estorff says:-

Only with pain and the deepest regret have I communicated to you the Government&apos;s order recalling you from the Supreme Command of the German troops in the ?. ? Not only will your departure produce sorrow and depro?ion among the troops, such as soldom occurs when an Army Commander leaves, but your recall will be received with bitte? disappointment by all brave, patrictically-minded Germans.XXX

It is evident that, when Government orders can be commented upon in this fashion by officers in high comamnd, there is a dangerous spirit abroad in the Army. "The Times" reports from Berlin XXXX that there appear to be signs of a reactionary storm browing for the 9th of November.

I hope the Entente Commission which is going to the Baltic Provinces will oonvinoeitself on tho spot that there are no longer any troops with Colonel Bermondt who areGorman subjects, and I hope further that thaCommission will understand that Colonel Ber-mondt desires nothing different from GeneralDonikin.The West Russian CtRitral Souneil has ex-;   pressly recognised Latvia1s autonomy, and itspolitioal aim, which Colonel Bermondt alsoehampions, is a federative Great Russia, or,to be precise, a United States of Russia.The troops that still remain German arcall obeying the evacuation order, but a goodwnsf half have become Russian citizens, and will therefore remain.  ;The Entente Powers, too, will finallyrealise that Germany cannot offer any onpos-ition when a number of Germans wish to becomecitizens of another country.   It is inde^mr.-iblehow strongly the settlement idea dominates the.    .masse8.xIt is nevertheless regarded as probable that &quot;denikin, likeYuflonitch, will not be at all disposed to have anything to do with colonel Bermondt or with his Baltio force of Germans.. . .     ** * &apos;     - &apos; &apos;   *0.   With vtg9&amp;&amp; to von der Goltz and his forces the following conclusions appear to&apos;bo justified.    Von dor Goltz has person-ally been the heart and soul of the efforts made by the leadersof the German troops in,the Baltio Provinces to prolong thoirx Reuter telegram, October 20th.newspaper, discussing the whole Bali?io proceedings of the german troops, described them as the &quot;drees rehearsal&quot; of the coming german counter- revolut i on.Von der Goltz has been interviewed since his return toBorlin.   He described his letter to Bermondt as a purely person-al mattor, and added:-

He hasmanaged, with the collusion of Gorman officers in tho homo army to obtain supplies and ammunition, smuggled without much coiaooal-mont ovior the German frontier.   He has induced a Russian militaryadventurer, Colonel naval officer-Bermondt. to ignore tho authority ofGeneral Yudenitch and to form a Pus so-German legion, which is attaing the Lettish Govornmont at Riga, this force being largely compoof Germans from von dor Goltz&apos;s Corps.The German Government have hesitated to take earlier andmore decisive steps to secure the withdrawal of tho German force,because they feared that these troops on their return, boing dis-appointed of the land which was promised thorn in tho Baltic Provincos, would form an olomcnt of dangerous disorder either in anerfcromo revolutionary or, in a reactionary sense   Thoy furtherdreaded the offoot which disciplinary measures against von dorGoltz and his subordinates would produoo upon the officers of thonow Army at home, many of whom were known to be in sympathy withtheir comrades in the Baltic Provinces,   it is also possible thatthe Government themselves entertained secret hopes of tho   estab-lishmont of close relations with a new. regime in Russia as the

Thoy fuatfbhordreaded the effect which disciplinary measures against von dorGoltz and his subordinates would produce upon tho officors of thenow Army at home, many of whom were known to be in sympathy withtheir comrades in the Baltic Provinces,   it is also possible thatthe Government themselves entertained secret hopes of tho   cstab-lisbmont of close relations with a new regime in Russia as tho
reward of the assistance they might offer in oftrnh^Y^j^j/tywt^i^It scorns only too probable that in spite of the orders oftho German Government.;: a section of the German forces in tho PalticProvincos will continue to place Difficulties in tho way of theirdemoblisation, although some of thorn arc now being evacuated,   &quot;that case the German Government have K as they urge, no militarymoans of compelling obodioncc to their prdors..Tho Allied and Associated Powers arc not themselves in aposition to send forces to cxpol tho Gorman troops, but tho GormanGovernment has welcomed tho despatch of an Inter-Allied Commissionto supervise tho evacuation and control the frontier traffic.To invite tho Poles to undertake the task of expellingthe Germans would seom te involve greater perils than any otherexpedient.   Apart from the relations of the Polos with the I-ithuan-ians through whose territory the Polish force would have tc pass,it is extremely probable that Polish action would bo the signal forthe outbreak, first of irregular, and afterwards of regular, war between Germany and Poland.   The Polos might at first overrun Silesia,and, in any case, tho prospects of a peaceful plebiscite in UpperSilesia would be compromised.   There is, moreover, another Gormanfordo astride the main lino from Berlin to Warsaw with one flankresting on Birnbaum.   A section of this force, which was origina-klly raised by tho Prussian landed proprietors for defence againstPolish raids, is under tho command of the&quot;very vigorous GeneralHoffman of Brots-Litvosk fame   He has recently given interviewsin whioh ho expresses his opinion of tho poor prospects of thePolish Republio;   it is known that he favours reaction both for russia and for Germany;   and he would, doubtless, wolcome the out-break of hostilities and the chanco of marching into Poland.It is possible.&quot;.&apos;v that if Yutfenitch and Denikin ultimately succeed in tho capture of Petrograd and Moscow without the assistance of theGermans of naval officer-BermondtTs Russo-German force, the action of tho
