5MIS tfOOUMiilHH) 13 THE PROgim Off III3. BKITAi&amp;lO MAJESTY13 GOYOKilHluIITOfficial Histories^Note b;y .the^ 3ei&quot;leta^^^On the eve of the publication, of the first of the series of official Hi&amp;tories, namely, the iUval History, very serious difficulties have arisen which concern both the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for ivar.2t     Throughout the &apos;. ar Sir Julian Corbett had worked in constantcommunication on doubtful points-with.the first Sea Lcrd and itwas therefore hoped that the book would meet with the approval ofthe Admiralty,     The proofs of the complete volume were submittedto the .Admirr.lty on March 10th.     A month later air Julian Corbett,after seeing: the ilrst -Sea Lord on April ICth, retained the        \impression that the book h*-d been approved.     On August 23rd,hov,ever, another submission oi-the history was asked for by theAdmiralty *nd a second set of proofs was forwarded.     after considering them the Admiralty proposed a prefatory note placingall responsibility on the author and divesting the Admiralty ofall responsibility.     air Julian Corbett and I accepted this condition.     A food many alterations have been.made to meet the criticisms of the Admiralty and if the principle of publicationis accepted by the Cabinet, a point on which the present Boardof the Admiralty have as yet offered no opinion, I understandthey would agree as reg-rds details.3,     Mr. Churchill has circulated a - iiemorandum (G.T. 7087) onhis views and there is no need to summarise them here.     great efforts have been made on both sides of the controversy to&apos; cometo an agreement and for tie last few weeks Sir Julian Corbett andjir   James lasterton omith, on behali of Lr* Churchillhave been
in frequerit&apos;ociifejre.ncer    Mr. ^nuroiiilX, now-e-ver,, ,cannot see hisv ay to agree to the pnbJjLo-atxon of the volume ^Lei^. jjer-taJLn oori -inaldocuments are published either as part of the History, orsimultaneously with the History-     These documents include a .cental, number of Admire It y Minutes and the Board cf the Admiraltycannot ^-ree to their publication,4,     Such in bycad -outline is the immediate difficulty.     Although,strictly spe*kin?&apos;f it only affects the first volume of the Kavalhistory, the whole question of the publication of Official Eistor-ies seems to be involved..     Is it feasible to write Officialhistories of events that have only just cocurred?   The author,however discreet he may be, is in a very awkward dilemmarHowever sparing- he may be of personal comment, the manner-inwhich, he marshals his facts, mere especially when unsuccessfuloperations have to be recorded, is liable to reflect on oneleader or another, on this department or on that.     The veryabsence of personal comment must weaken the interest in the book.Is it fair to publish tho narrative when events are so recentthat all the principal actors are still on the stage of public life?   Ii;y one could have oeen more discreet than Sir JulianCorbett, an experienced and distinguished historian who has IWthe complete confidence of successive Boards of the Admiraltyiand has intimate knowledge of the navy past and present.     Thereis not the smallest reason to suppose that the other distinguishedhistorians engaged on the Official Histories will be more successful,    Kr. Fortescue, in writing the first volume of theMilitary History, has had to cover most controversial ground,sn3 has unfortunately allowed himself to be Jrawn into public controversy.     The later portions of the military history arenot likely to be les^ controversial.5*     These are arguments against the production of OfficialHistories at all.     They c..n be reinforoed by other arguments.The Official Historios are always liable to be the target ofactack in jarliament and press.     Coming in a succession spread
over b:ny years, ^ach ono ::ub;jeoted to criticism, they may prove very troublesome in tho egress to;    Jidministrctivelytthey cie * source ox cots tent trouble end friction.    Every timetho KivcoriCcl Section produces a history, it hes to run thegauntlet oi departmental criticise, which ia opt to emasculatethe work, end deprive, it oi half its interest,6*    Another arguineiit ofter uaod against Official Histories iathat they ere costly end that they never pay their way.    This iscertainly true oi die pool; r.nd uijht prove true even of the       &apos;prasonc histories in spite oi the public interest in all thatrelates to the recent v.ar.    It ia submitted, however, thatthis argument is ono ihrt oujht not bo do pressed too far.    Itis a fallacy to attempt to measure tho vtlue of OfficialHistories by tho test oi receipts.    li such a teat wore appliedto other scientific worhs it ia probable that scientific research would come to an end.    A History is essentially a workof reference and education.    To tho Naval and military Serviceshistory botia somewhat the same relation aa Parliamentarypapers do to Imperial Parliament.    In a recent  ear thepublication of parliamentary papers cost  75,^00.    *t thattime Hnnaera alone cost  9,000 to  10,000, and probably this iamuch hijher now.     This coot i3 presumably Justified by the historical and educational value of the documents concerned andthe some can be said to apply to tho proceed in^a of royal commissions.     iractly the same applies to the v/ar Histories.Tho enpual coot of producing 7/er Histories ia probably f: r lessthan that involved in the lcrjo mass oi secret and confidentialliterature issued by oho Admiralty and War Of floe for essential educational purposes, tho necessity for which no-one would think oi i uestio/iiu0.    One difference between these and the war hirfcoriu3 io that pert of the co^t of thelatter is recouped.
7&apos;..      If the arguments against..official Jiist-ortca arc.strong thosein favour of their publication arn not less cogent.   Extraordinarilylittle if? known of the early part of the war.   One has only to read the proofs of Sir Julian Corbotfs absorbing volume to enter a country that is entirely now to nost people.     The same is to agreat extent true of the military and other histories.   The Govern-mont, therefore, has the monopoly of a mass of information which thepublic are entitled to receive in a readable form.   Much of it is so seoret that the material cannot con nov, or for any years, b^placed at the disposal of the general historian, over whom theGovernment can -exercise no&quot; control.    It is, however, not only theenlightenment of the public that has to be Considered, but what is*perhaps -von more important, the education of the professional&apos; officer.-There is he to go for information if there is no official hi.story?Even the oersonal accounts that have been published of certain navaland military operations are reported to me to be inaccurate.   It isonly when the orders, diaries, logs, etc., are considered as a whole,and compared with information from every source, that a true accountcan be obtained.   No selection of official documents will supplythis need,Finally there is the consideration that an antidote is requiredto the unofficial historic:-,, which habitually attribute all naval andmilitary failures to the ineptitude of the Government, to say nothing of the accounto of individual officers, frequently ill-informed andpartisan in character, which are apt to mislead public as well asservice opinion.   This &quot;as one of the principal reasons ^hich led tothe original decision to produce the histories.   The output of suchmatter has exceeded all anticipations both in volume and vigour. .8.       In order to aoeiot the Cabin-t in deciding this question I havehad./prepared the attached Memorandum in regard to the origin of theHiotorical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence and thedevelopment of th^ histories of th&quot; present war.    If this is studiedit &quot;ill bo coon that the following Histories are in course of
preparationA Naval HistoryA History of Sea-borne trade  History of the Merchant NavyA Military HistoryAn Air History.It will further be seen that Sir Julian Corbett&apos;s Naval History-wasto be followed immediately by the publication of Mr. Fayie&apos;o firstvolume on Sea-borne Trade and Mr. Archibald Hurd&apos;s first volume onthe Mercantile Marino.   Mr. FortoeeueU first volume of the MilitaryHistory should be ready early in 1920 and Sir Walter Raleigh&apos;s firstvolume of the Air History next summer.   Contracts have been signed$rith publishers in the case of the Navel History, the History of theMerchant Navy, the Military History and the History of the War in theAir, but not in the ease of the History of Sea-borne Trade.9.      The actual expenditure incurred in the preparation of thoseHistories is difficult to estimate, since, as explained in theattached Memorandum, a good deal of the preliminary work in arranging the records would be necessary in any case.   To ascertain the total up:,to September 30th,1919, the Secretary of the Historical Sectionestimates that about  ^,600 must be added to tho figures in his memorandum, making an approximate aggregate sum of  2^,000.   this figure includes the sum of  8,691, representing the salaries paid tothe historians up to the present time.The above sum of  2^000 docs not include the liabilities for compensation and Iopb, should it be decided not to publish.   In that event there must be added the cost of the maps, already printed off$2,000), and the claims of the publishers for out-of-pocket expenses(about  2,000) and loss of profit on the rescinded contracts.10,     Should the middle course bo taken of issuing tho booksconfidentially, for the information of officers, the loss tothe Treasury cannot be estimated, as fresh contracts would haveto be made with the publishers and the authors, and there wouldbe no return to the Crown in the form of Royalties.
11,      A point which cannot &quot;be ovcrlcK)kcd...is. tbx--ir^.on the historians, if it is decided not to publish the histories.Sir Julian Corbet! has been working on the Naval History sincethe beginning of the war.   Although he did not begin to writethe History until the 17th March, 1916., he has supervised thecollating of the material (for a long time as a volunteer )from August 1914 onwards.   It is a very serious matter for anhistorian of his reputation and experience to have the work ofmore than five years rendered barren.   The same would apply,though in a lesser degree., to the Other historians.12.       The question is also one of some Parliamentary importance.On the 28th June, 1916, Mr. Asquith made an announcement inparliament in regard to the History and on the 20th November1918 Mr. Bonar Lav/ stated in Parliament that &quot;It has always beenthe intention and still is, to commence publication immediatelyafter the conclusion of&apos; Peace&quot; .   pn the 13th March, 1919, Dr.Maonamara stated that&apos;fit is hoped that the first volume ofthe Official Naval History of the War will appear before the  &apos;end of the year&quot;.   Good reasons would have to be.given inparliament for a failure to produce the History. . It would almost certainly form, the subject of parliamentary attack andthis would, probably be renewed if and when;the matter had beenconsidered by the Public Accounts Committee.13.       The&apos; questions which arise for decision are as follows:;-(1) is Sir Julian Corbett&apos;s first volume of theNaval History to be published ?(2) if so, is its publication to be accompanied bythat of the documents desired by Mr, Churchillbut objeoted to by the Board of the Admiralty- ?(3) Are the ether official Histories to be published ?Not e.It is thought that at any rate Mr. ArchibaldHurd&apos;s History of the Mercantile Marine and Mr..Fayle&apos;s History cf Sea-borne Trade, and proba-bly Sir Walter Raleigh1s History of the Air,could be published without arousing controversy,but Mr, ?ortcscue&apos;s volume on Military Historyis much mere, controversial, ,
(4)   if the Histories,are not published shall thecomple ted volumes be issued as confidentialTo ok s for the use of the. Navy, Army and Air Service ?(5)   m this event should the outstanding volumes ofthe history be continued for confidential use ?A-nd if the answer is in the affirmative, should they be written with a view to publication inthe future ?(6)   If the History is not published shall the Hia-torical Section of the Committee of ImperialDefence continue its work in collating-material for an eventual History ?(Attention is drawn to the very useful andextraordinarily cheap Diary of the War whichhas been compiled solely by light duty ;-Officers,i.e. officers unfit for general service lentfor the purpose by other Departments,and has orlyinvolved the wages ..-of  mc   r tw .

THE &quot;Historical Section&quot; owes its origin to a memorandum by Lord Esher,dated the 6th September, 1906 (C.I.D. Paper 90-b), in which he urged the importanceof forming an &quot;Historical Section&quot; of the Committee of Imperial Defence for thepurpose of producing historical work generally, as apart from technical handbooks. he pointed out that conditions and circumstances are applicable to the requirements of thiscountry, which are foreign to any of the great continental Powers. At this time thehistories of three different campaigns were being written in three different departments of the War Office, and the naval portion of one of these campaigns was in preparationat the Admiralty. The lessons, he observed, could not be adequately appreciated unlessthe naval and military operations were treated as a whole together with the political considerations, and added that neither the Admiralty nor the War Office was speciallyqualified to deal with history in this aspect. He was also convinced that the treasury would obtain better value for the money spent, and the service would be more cheaplyrendered, if the responsibility for collecting the naval and military history of the nationwas transferred to the Department of the Committee of Imperial Defence. he therefore suggested that a sub-committee, consisting of the Director of MilitaryOperations, the Director of Naval Intelligence, and the Secretary of the Committee ofImperial Defence, should be appointed to prepare a scheme for the purpose.2. Lord Esher&apos;s memorandum was laid before the Committee of Imperial defence at its ninety-third meeting on the 13th November, 1906, and the appointment of theSub-Committee approved.3. The Sub-Committee, which was presided over by Sir George Sydenham Clarke(Secretary of the. Committee of Imperial Defence), presented its report on the 10thJanuary, 1907 (C.I.D. Paper 96-b). Attached to the report is an appendix containing a note by the Treasury on the &quot; Official History of the War in South Africa,&quot; dated the4th May, 1905.Upon enquiry into the arrangements existing at the Admiralty and the War office for the production of official histories of naval and military operations, the Sub-Com-mittee found that the Admiralty had no machinery, and that at the War Office there-was no section specially concerned with the production of military histories, though
various official publications had been issued from time to time.   The Sub-Committeesummed up the position thus : (a.) Neither at the Admiralty nor at the War Office has there been hitherto anyregular history section.(b.) It has therefore been inevitable that the work has sometimes fallen into thehands of officers who have no aptitude for the writing of history, and that,as shown in the Appendix, there has been no policy and no direction onconsistent and harmonious lines,(c.) No trustworthy estimates of cost could be prepared, and such irregularproceedings as are recorded in the appendix are liable to occur.(d.) Great delays in producing accounts of contemporary operations have occurred,(e.) There has been no attempt to deal with the history naval or military of thewars of the past, although the Kecord Office must be rich in materials.(/.) There has been no adequate recognition of the value of such official histories. as are produced in foreign countries for the purpose of educating officers andthe reading public in the art of war.With regard to the cost of the South African War the Sub-Committee found thatthe expenditure had been extravagant to the last degree&apos;. Though commenced in 1900the first volume had not appeared until 1906, and the second volume was not yetpublished.The Sub-Committee did not definitely recommend that the production of officialhistories should be placed under the Committee of Imperial Defence, but it is clear from their report that the members were in favour of it. They suggested that it wouldbe advantageous to employ retired officers or practised civilian writers of history tocarry out the larger work, while the history of minor operations might be written inthe Section. The general lessons of a war should be briefly summed, and the summariessent to the Admiralty or War Office for approval. For all other matters form, length,arrangement, &amp;c. the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence should beresponsible.The note by the Treasury, attached to the report, emphasises the extremelyunsatisfactory arrangement under which the &quot; History of the South African War &quot; wasbeing carried out by the War Office.   &quot; There has never been a clear and consistent&apos;  conception, either of the kind of history which ought to be written, or of the means to attain that object, or of the proper method of publication.&quot;5. The Keport of the Sub-Committee was laid before the Committee of ImperialDefence at its ninety-fifth meeting on the 21st February, 1907, and they decided that&quot; they accept the principle that the work of preparing histories of naval and militaryoperations should be concentrated and placed under the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;6. The first task of the Historical Section was to complete the &quot; Official Historyof the War in South Africa.&quot; The first volume of this work, written by the lateColonel G. F. E. Henderson, had reflected on the Government, and had been deemedunsuitable for publication. It consequently had partly to be rewritten, and the postponement of publication after it had been announced undoubtedly contributed toits unsatisfactory sale. The work was taken over by the Committee of ImperialDefence in August 1907, and Yolumes II, III, and IV were completed in March 1910.They had a favourable but not enthusiastic reception by the press. This history wasnot a financial success.7. Before its completion, the Historical Section had embarked on a history of the russo--Japanese War. An account of the military operations of that war had been commenced in the War Office in 1905, the intention being that it should be completed in six parts. On a suggestion being made that a similar history should be prepared bythe Admiralty, dealing with the naval operations, it was thought advisable to concentrate the work under one control and produce a combined naval and militaryhistory. This work was entrusted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, who decidedto bring it out in three volumes. It occupied the whole of -the energies of the historical Section until the outbreak of the present war. At that time two volumes,had been published and the third was ready for press. Owing, however, to the heavy demands on the Stationery Office and the Ordnance Survey Department arising out ofthe present war, publication had to be postponed, and the volume is now awaiting a,favourable opportunity to publish.8. The &quot; Official History of the russo-Japanese War&quot; was no more a financial x,\success than the &quot; History of the South African War,&quot; possibly owing to the slow rate
Part II..AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF WAR.10. At the very outset of the war, a commencement was at once made on the tabula-tion of information of historical importance in regard to the war. This procedure wasadopted at the instance of the Admiralty, and three weeks later the work was entrusted to the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.* On the 27th August,1914, by direction of the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith), an Historical Committee was formed (C.I.D. Paper W.H.-1) composed of Vice-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade (in the chair) and Mr. Julian Corbett, representing the Admiralty (M. 01461/14), Colonelthe Hon. M. G. Talbot, representing the War Office, Captain M. P. A. Hankey,Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, with Major E. Y. Daniel, Secretary, to&quot;consider and advise on the question of collating material for a future history of thepresent war.&quot; This Committee is still in existence and was composed (up to.the.31st August) as follows : Admiral Sir Edmond Slade (Chairman).Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. P. A. Hankey, Secretary, War Cabinet.Rear-Admiral Sir John F. Parry, Hydrographer of the Navy.Sir Julian S. Corbett.Major-General Sir P. de B. Radcliffe, Director of Military Operations, War Office.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Arthur Leetham, War Office.Lieutenant-Colonel F. S. Brereton, Royal Army Medical Corps.Major E. Y. Daniel (Secretary).It was strongly felt at the time that years must elapse before an OfficialHistory could be written, but the experience of the South African war had shown howdifficult it was to get together information unless some machinery existed for thepurpose. The War Office were consulted on the matter and welcomed the proposalsof the Historical Committee (C.I.D. Paper 204-b), which were approved at the one* The permanent staff consisted then of Major E. Y. Daniel (Secretary) and Mr. G. S. Oxburgh(Confidential Clerk), and has remained unchanged throughout the war.of production. But both works had an educational value. They were studied at theNaval and Military Colleges and recommended as the official text-books for officialpromotion examinations. They were also in considerable demand by lecturers on military subjects. The material collected for the &quot; Official History of the Russo-Japanese War&quot; was moreover utilised with other material for the compilation of a confidential Staff History (Naval) by Sir Julian Corbett for the use of the Admiralty.This work he completed in July 1914.It is by the standard of their value for professional educational purposes thatofficial histories must be judged. It is doubtful if they will ever pay, and it is to be feared that they will always be the subject of parliamentary and public criticism.9. Towards the end of 1913, when the end of the &quot; History of the Russo-japanese war&quot; was insight, a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, preside over by Lord Esher, met to consider the future work of the Historical Section, and presented their report on the 22nd December, 1913 (C.I.D. Paper, 183-b).The Sub-Committee held that, except in such cases as the Russo-Japanese war, inwhich special and unique sources of information might be available, it would not bedesirable for the future to attempt the compilation of histories of wars in which thiscountry had not been a belligerent, but that in such cases it would be sufficient totranslate or abridge the official histories of the belligerents themselves, or of other nations compiling them. In the case of wars in which this country should be abelligerent, the Sub-Committee considered that special arrangements should be made as occasion arose, and in the meantime the Historical Section might usefully revert to research work. They suggested that a small permanent staff, consisting of one officer and one clerk, should remain under the control of the Secretary of the Committee ofImperial Defence.Such was the position when the present war broke out.
hundred and thirty-first meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence held on the-27th January, 1915, with the Prime Minister in the chair.This work of collecting and arranging the naval and military material has beencarried on continuously since that date.Official Histories.Naval and Military Operations.11. After the war had lasted for nearly a year, Lord Kitchener and the War Officepressed strongly for the production of an Official Military History. It was clearthat it would be impossible for many years to compile a Naval or Military technical staff History, and something of a more popular and general character was asked for.What was required was an authoritative account for the general reader to meet aprobable demand, to educate public opinion, and to provide an antidote to the usualunofficial history which, besides being generally inaccurate, habitually attributes allnaval and military failures to the ineptitude of the Government.It was evident that if a military history was produced, a naval history would alsobe demanded. The arguments for one were as powerful as for the other. If little was known of the retreat from Mons, and the other earlier incidents of the war owing tothe veil of secrecy that had been drawn over the operations, this was even more true of the Navy. To this day very little is known of what the Grand Fleet was doing at its northern bases, of the wide-spread operations against the German commercedestroyers, or of the measures for securing the safety of our transports, conveyingtroops from all parts of the world. The object and intention of the Dardanelles,Salonica, and Mesopotamia operations are still quite imperfectly understood.The Historical Committee met on the 26th August, 1915, to consider the proposal,and recommended that such a history should be written and published at the earliestpossible moment after the war and issued officially : &quot; By Direction of the HistoricalSection of the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot; They recommended that the&quot; Military History&quot; should be entrusted to the Hon. J. W. Fortescue, and-the &quot;NavalHistory,&quot; to include oversea operations, to Mr. Julian S. Corbett the two books to bedistinct, but co-ordinated.Mr. Fortescue was recommended by the War Office and Lord Kitchener.Mr. Corbett had been lecturer in history at the Koyal Naval War College ever since its establishment, had just completed, as stated above, a &quot; Confidential Naval Historyof the Russo-Japanese War,&quot; and had been employed in supervising the collecting and arranging of the naval historical material of the present war. He had also been selected by the Admiralty as their representative on the Historical Committee.Both gentlemen expressed their willingness to undertake the work.After somewhat prolonged negotiations with the Treasury the case for an&quot;Official Interim History&quot; was submitted by Sir Maurice Hankey to the PrimeMinister, and approval for the proposal was given a month later in a private letterfrom Mr. Montagu, dated the 24th January, 1916.The official approval of the Treasury to the appointment of Mr. Fortescue andMr. Corbett on the terms arranged with them was given on the 25th February, 1916(Treasury letter, 4655/16). On the 7th March the War Office wrote to say: &quot;they accept the arrangements that have been made&quot; (40/W.O./2950 (C. 1)), and on the17th March the Admiralty wrote to say: &quot;They concur generally in the desirabilityof such a history being written, and that Mr. Julian S. Corbett should be entrusted with its compilation&quot; (M. 38071/16).On the 23rd October, 191b, a meeting of the Historical Committee was held toconsider the question of appointing an additional historian for the military history, inview of the length of the war and the many theatres to which it had spread.Mr. Fortescue had, moreover, intimated that he wished to be relieved as soon as he had completed the first two volumes. The Committee came to the conclusion that if thehistory was to be completed within a reasonable time it was necessary to divide it intosections, and recommended that an additional historian should be appointed at once.A sub-committee was directed to make the selection, and the choice fell on CaptainG. S. Gordon, Professor of English Language and Literature at Leeds, who had servedthroughout the war, and was at the time attached to the Military IntelligenceDirectorate, War Office. His name was submitted to the Secretary of State for War(Lord Milner) and the Chief of the General Staff (General Sir Henry Wilson), both of
whom expressed their approval of the appointment. The Secretary of the HistoricalSection was informed of this in a private letter from. Sir H. J. Greedy on the 14thNovember, 1918. Captain Gordohs appointment was approved by the War cabinet at a meeting held on the 28th November, 1918 (No. 27/E./8), and Treasury sanction for his salary to take effect from the 1st January, 1919, was given on the 9th April,1919 (12702/19).Seaborne Trade History.12. In the C.I.D. letter (H.S./110) to the Admiralty requesting their approval ofthe proposal that Mr. Corbett should write an official naval history, their sanction wasalso requested to the publication by the Garten Foundation of a &quot; History of theEconomic Effect of the Naval Operations for the Attack and Defence of Trade.&quot; Theidea of preparing this history arose from a want that had been constantly felt at theRoyal Naval War College. When lecturing there, Mr. Corbett had been frequentlyasked by naval officers where they could study the actual effects of operations againstseaborne trade in past wars, and the only reply was that nothing trustworthy existed onthe subject. In preparing, therefore, for the history of the present war,.one of the firstcares was to see that this special branch of the subject should be dealt with as fully as seemed desirable.Special knowledge being required for the work, Mr. C. Ernest Fayle&apos;s name hadbeen submitted to the Admiralty on the 15th June. 1915, and approved.When it was explained to the Admiralty that the work would not in any waytouch upon the policy of the Government in preventing supplies reaching the enemy,they wrote on the 10th April, 1916, stating that &quot;they approve the publication of awork on the attack and defence of trade as proposed. It is desired that the bookshould be sent to this department for criticism and remarks in the proofstage.&quot;   (M. 40148/16.)Almost the whole of this history has been prepared at the expense of the GartonFoundation. It is only since July 1919 that the salary of the historian has been paidby the Government.The Merchant Navy in the War.13. The supervision of this history, which is being written by Mr. Archibald Hurd,was undertaken by the Historical Section, after the author had been selected, at thespecial request of the Board of Trade and the Admiralty, and with the concurrence ofthe Ministry of Shipping. This arrangement ensures that there shall be no overlappingbetween this history, the history of the naval operations by Sir Julian Corbett, and theseaborne trade history being written by Mr. Ernest Fayle.The object of this history is to instruct the public in the magnificent workperformed by the mercantile marine in the war. It will embrace the organisation ofthe mercantile marine, its relations&quot; with the Admiralty and other Governmentdepartments, the manner in which these relations have developed during the war, andthe service which it has rendered. Mr. Hurd will lay special stress on the personal and psychological aspects of the merchant service and will ignore, so far as possible,economic factors.   No similar history has been written in the past.The financial arrangements for its production were made by the Historical section in consultation with the Treasury and considered at a meeting of the HistoricalCommittee on 11th July, 1917, at which Mr. Barstow was present, and stated theTreasury were prepared to concur in them. The official approval of the Treasury to the steps proposed for the preparation of this work is contained in a letter to the Board ofTrade dated 12th July, 1917 (21561/17).War in the Air.14. This was the last history to be undertaken by the Historical Section. It had long been recognised that after the conclusion of peace there would be a strong public demand for an authentic account of the airman&apos;s part in the war, and when the RoyalAir Force was formed in April, 1918, by the amalgamation for administrative purposesof the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps it was considered the time was opportune to move m the matter.By direction of Admiral Slade, Chairman of the Historical Committee, and withthe approval of the Secretary of the War Cabinet, Major Daniel at once got into^communication with the Air Ministry, and on 7th May, 1918, the Secretary wrote to[1270] &quot; C
Gsay the Air Council were in complete agreement with the proposal &quot;regarding thepreparation of an official history of the Eoyal Air Force with which will be incorporatedthe war history of the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps,&quot; and requested the Historical Section to find a suitable author (6567/18). This question presentedsome little difficulty. Eventually Sir Walter Raleigh, Professor of English Literatureat Oxford University, who was strongly recommended by the President of the Boardof Education, was selected for the work, and Treasury sanction to his salary was given on the 22nd July, 1918 (26179/18).The question of the production of this history and the provision of the necessary staff was considered at a meeting of the Historical Committee on the 24th July, 1918,and the proposals laid before it approved. Treasury sanction was obtained on the28th August, 1918 (33361/18).The proceedings of this meeting of the Historical Committee and of the previousmeetings were circulated to the War Cabinet.This history will be unique in English literature.15. All the above-mentioned histories are being prepared in close co-operation withthe different departments concerned.16. The administrative work in connection with their production has been carriedout entirely by the Secretary of the Historical Section, who has consulted the Treasuryat every stage.17. On the 28th June, 1916, the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) made the followingannouncement in Parliament: &quot;In view of the demand which is likely to arise, and the desirability ofproviding the public with an authentic account, it has been decided to prepare for publication as soon as possible after the close of the war an Interim Official Historydealing with its various aspects. This history will be based on the material whichis being collected and arranged by the Historical Section of the - Committee ofImperial Defence for an eventual Staff history.&quot; The work will be in three sections, which will deal, respectively, with theNaval and Military Operations and the General Effects of the War on SeaborneTrade.&quot; The Naval Section has been entrusted to Mr. Julian Corbett, and theMilitary Section to Mr. John Fortescue, while -for the Trade Section the trustees of the Garton Foundation have kindly placed their staff at the disposal of the historical Section.&quot; The Sections will be published separately, but prepared in concert. Thework is already well advanced.&quot;The question of the progress of the history was mentioned again in the Houseof Commons on the 20tb. November, 1918, when Mr. Bonar Law, replying to a question,stated that &quot; The Historical Section of the War Cabinet is not in a position to publish the early volumes of the popular history of the war now. It has always been theintention, and still is, to commence publication immediately after the conclusionof peace.&quot;The last mention of the history in Parliament was on the 13th March, 1919, atwhich time the proofs of the first volume were in the hands of the Admiralty. Onthat date Dr. Macnamara stated that &quot; It is hoped that the first volume of the &apos; Official Naval History of the War&apos;will appear before the end of the year.&quot;Medical.History of the War.18. A popular history of the services of the Royal Army Medical Corps is beingwritten by Lieutenant-Colonel F. S. Brereton, R.A.M.C., who is a member of the historical Committee and has been engaged since November 1914 in collecting and arranging medical material mainly War Diaries.Though this history is not being prepared under the auspices of the HistoricalSection, Lieutenant-Colonel Brereton has always kept in close touch with it. ^The preparation of a Technical Medical History, to be edited by Major-general sir W. G. Macpherson, R.A.M.C., and to be completed in three years, has also been quite recently approved.
, Part III.THE PRESENT STATE OF THE OFFICIAL HISTORIES.19. Once the decision was taken to produce Official Histories every effort wasmade to push them on as rapidly as possible. Experience has shown that, if this is not done, the dela)7s become interminable. New sources of information are constantlyopening up, entailing revision. They are not necessarily of great importance, but theycannot be ignored in an Official History. Often, by the time the final history is completed, interest has evaporated. What has been aimed at, therefore, is to produce in succession a series of volumes on various aspects of the war, which will sustaininterest and not expose the Government to the charge of dilatoriness.20. Sir Julian corbetts first volume of the &quot; Naval History &quot; is ready for publication.It could be followed immediately by Mr. Fayle&apos;s first volume on &quot; Seaborne Trade,&quot; andshortly afterwards by Mr. Archibald Hurd&apos;s first volume on the &quot; Mercantile Marine.&quot;The first volume of the &quot; Military History &quot; by Mr. Fortescue is completed, and shouldbe ready for publication early in 1920. Sir Walter Raleigh, whose &quot;Air History&quot; wascommenced much later than the others, hopes to have his first volume ready by nextautumn, by which time the second volumes of the other histories should be coming out.21. The exact state of the various official histories is as follows : Naval Operations. Commenced the 17th March, 1916. To be completed in fourvolumes. First volume now ready for publication in this country and theUnited States. Second volume written and in typescript; but requires revisionin view of information obtained by the Commission recently returned from theDardanelles; estimated to be ready for publication summer 1920. Third andfourth volumes estimated to be ready by summer, 1921, and summer, 1922,respectively. Publisher: Messrs. Longmans. Contract signed. Price of firstvolume 17s. 6&apos;d. (12s. 6d. for text -f- 5s. for case of maps). First volume sentto the Admiralty for official approval the 10th March, 1919, and to membersof War Cabinet the 13th March, 1919.Military Operations. Commenced the 17th February, 1916. To be completed in five volumes (estimated). First volume finished and: in typescript, but notyet being set up in type. Estimated to be ready for publication early in newyear. Second volume written; will probably be ready for publication in summer, 1920. No useful estimate can be made as to date when the remainingvolumes will be ready. Publisher: Messrs. Macmillan. Contract signed.Price per volume, 12s. Gd. Original draft of main portion of first volume sentto War Office the 29th July, 1918. Returned the 14th August, 1918, withremark that General Staff concurred with the general lines on which it wasbeing written. The Army Council had already (the 8th April, 1918) approvedof this volume being issued to the public as soon as it was ready, and attachedan explanatory preface, which they considered should be published with it(40/W.O./6023 (M.O. 3) ).Seaborne Trade. Commenced the 10th April, 1916. To be completed in threevolumes. First volume in type ; awaiting second galley proof. Second volumepartly written ; estimated to be ready for publication in autumn, 1920. Thirdvolume by end of 1921. Publisher : Mr. John Murray. Contract not signed.&apos;Price of volumes not yet settled, probably 12s. 6d First volume will be sentto Admiralty for official approval as soon as second galley proof is receivedfrom printers.Merchant Navy. Commenced the 1st August, 1917. To be completed in threevolumes. First volume being set up in type; estimated to be ready for publication in spring, 1920. Second volume will probably be ready by autumn,1920, and third by spring, 1921. Publisher: Mr. John Murray. Contractsigned. Price of volume, 12s. 6d. Will be sent to Admiralty and otherdepartments for official approval in proof stage.War in the Air. Commenced 1st August, 1918. To be completed in two volumesand a supplementary (statistics) volume. First volume being written, earlierchapters finished. Estimated to be ready for publication autumn, 1920 ;subsequent volume probably twelve months later. Publisher: ClarendonPress. Contract signed. Price per volume, 12s. 6a. Each chapter is submitted to the Air Ministry for their approval as it is written.
22. The terms under which the histories are being produced are laid down in theMemorandum of Agreement between the Controller of the Stationery Office and thevarious publishers. The terms are identical for each of the histories. The stationery office hold, on behalf of the Crown, the copyright and all rights of translation, and inorder that the American rights may be secured the publishers agree to publish simul-taneously in London and the United States. The maps are to be supplied by theController. The price of each volume is to be 12s. 6d. The price of a map volume if required is to be mutually settled. The publisher agrees to pay the Controller aroyalty of 22^ per cent, on the published price (less price of map volume) on the first10,000 copies, and 25 per cent, on all further copies sold in London, and a royalty of10 per cent, on all copies sold in the United States. A copy of the Memorandum ofAgreement is attached.23. In addition to the official histories referred to above, a &quot; Diary of the War&quot; isin course of 23reparation by the Historical Section. This consists of a chronologicalabstract of events day by day in four categories (military, naval, political, and blockade)with a monthly summary for each. The operations of all belligerents in all theatres are recorded, and all entries are based as far as possible on official records only.The  military  representative in London of the  Canadian   Government has established a separate branch of their Historical Section for the sole purpose ofproviding information relating to Canada&apos;s part in the war to the &quot; Diary&quot; Branchof the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence.This Diary has been most favourably reported on by all who have had access to it.It has proved of great value to the historians, who recognise it as a foundation of&quot; facts.upon which to build.   It also proved very useful at the Peace Conference in Paris,and is frequently referred to in order to obtain dates and other references.When completed it will be invaluable to many Government Departments as an authoritative book of reference, embodying in one work a brief chronicle of the war in all its aspects. In thisrespect.it will be unique, since the Historical Section is in a positionto collect accurate information from all sources. No one Department could produce asimilar work.It has been compiled solely by light duty officers, i.e., officers unfit for general service, lent for the purpose by other Departments, and the only expenditure hithertoincurred in its production has been the wages of one or two typists.The Diary was commenced in June 1917 by one officer (Major H. T. Skinner) lentby the War Office, and since that date several other officers have been employed, thenormal number being five or six. But it has been impossible always to maintain this number in consequence of officers being passed fit for service, demobilized, or transferredto other and (during the war) more important work.For these reasons there has been a lack of continuity which has delayed theprogress of the Diary. At the present date the Military and Political Sections are complete to the end of 1915, and the Naval and Blockade Sections to June 1915,There is now no one working on the Political and Blockade Sections. Captain E. G. F.Abraham, who was the first officer employed on these Sections, was transferred to theWar Cabinet Secretariat, and Lieutenant W. St. J. Pym, who succeeded him, was transferred to the Peace Delegation at Paris. Since his departure no suitable lightduty officer has been found to carry on the work.24. In addition to the Diary, a list of the Principal Events of the War has beencompiled. When this was commenced the Foreign Office expressed the desire to havethe work done as quickly as possible and agreed to print it. It is being produced in three parts, of which two have been printed, while the third (Subject Index) is nowbeing set up in type. A provisional confidential edition has been issued and beenfound of great value.   Captain H. FitzM. Stacke is mainly responsible for this work.The Diary Section works under the immediate supervision of the Secretary ofthe Historical Section.India s part in the War.25. In 1917 the Government of India requested that the Historical Section of theCommittee of Imperial Defence should undertake the history of India&apos;s part in the warinstead of forming a separate branch at headquarters to perform the work. On this understanding they sent all their records to the Historical Section in May 1919.
Part IV.COST OF THE OFFICIAL HISTORIES AND OF THE HISTORICAL SECTION.26. An exact estimate of the actual cost of the Official Histories is almost impossibleto make, whether they are considered separately or as a whole. The material on whichthey are based is for the most part the original records (telegrams, orders, despatches,reports, minutes, diaries, deck logs, signal and wireless logs, &amp;c.) These official recordshave been supplemented by the reports of interviews with numerous officers (including a number of prisoners of war) who have taken part in the operations, and information obtained from various outside sources. It is the duty of the Historical Section to collectand arrange all these records and also to summarise them. The records and summaries,being authentic, will always have their value, and will be available for officers engagedin writing monographs on special subjects and for a future Staff history. They arebeing made use of at the present moment by several naval and military officersemployed in this way. It must be understood that a large part of the expendituredescribed below would have had to be incurred in any case, unless it had been decidedto leave the material for the history severely alone and not even to collate it.27. Again, the histories cannot be considered as separate entities. The materialcollected by one branch of the history is available for the other branches. Take forexample the three histories dealing with the Navy&apos;s part in the War. Mr. Fayle hasreceived every possible assistance from the Naval Staff. All Historical Sectionsummaries, preliminary narratives, and important papers bearing on seaborne trade aresent to him, and without this assistance it would have been impossible for him to under-take the work single-handed. He has received from Mr. Hurd much valuable materialon the ecqnomic effects of the war at sea. Sir Julian Corbett has constantly given him criticism and advice. On the other hand, be has acted as a supernumerary and(until the 1st July, 1919) unpaid member of the Staff. Sir Julian Corbett and theNaval Staff have made use of his preliminary narratives, diaries, &amp;c. He has writtenmany memoranda for Sir Julian Corbett on points connected with the German war against trade. He has investigated for him questions raised by the Admiralty and theForeign Office. He has had many discussions with Mr. Hurd as to the scope of theirrespective work.Similarly, Mr. Hurd has received much assistance from the other branches.By this method of mutual co-operation all duplication has been avoided.The above remarks are equally applicable to the other histories.28. The Secretariat carries out all the work in connection with the administration and organisation of the section, and superintends generally the preparation of all thehistories.29. In considering the cost of the Historical Section as apart from the OfficialHistories it is necessary to mention that it is constantly receiving enquiries on questions connected with the war from individual officers, other Departments, and from outside,such as the Casualties Branch, War Graves Registration Committee, Clasps Committee,Battles Committee, Record Offices, and from the Official Historians and Historical Sectionsof the Dominions and Allies.30. Subject to the above remarks the following statement shows the cost of the historical Section to the 31st March, 1919.The total cost of the Historical Section as a whole, including the collecting and arranging of material and the preparation of five histories, from the outbreak of war tothe 31st March, 1919, was :- Secretariat ... ... ... ...     4,171Naval BranchMilitary BranchHistory of Merchant NavyAir Branch11, L348,7381,4001,62427,067Of this sum 21,2681 was borne on the vote of the Committee of Imperial Defence,5,589/. on the Navy Vote, and the remainder (210Z.) on the vote of the Air Ministry.Spread over a period of 4f years, this is at an average rate of 5,80Ol. per annum.The explanation of the cost of the Military Branch being so much less than that ofthe Naval Branch is that a great deal more work has been put into the arrangement[1270] D
of papers by the latter than by the former, and more light duty officers have beenemployed with the Military Branch from time to time.31. The following estimate of the cost of the histories to the 31st March, 1919,taken separately, was prepared for the information of the Treasury in June 1919 :-Naval History. Historian......   &apos;     .........    2,400Staff (O.I.D. Vote)..............    1,493Staff (Navy Vote)......... 3,4797,372This covers a period of 3^ years, that is at the rate of 2,328/. per annum.The yearly salaries as at the 31st March, 1919, were:  Historian .. ... ... ... ...    1,000Staff (C.I.D. Vote).............       425Staff (Navy Vote)......... ...    1,9903,415If the volumes are completed at the estimated dates the future cost of the historyshould be, therefore, 11,1001., making a total cost of 18,4721. spread over 6^- years,that is a yearly average of 2,9001. or 4,6207. per volume.Military History. Historians (2)       ... ... ... ...    2,625Staff      ... ... ... ,.. ...     5,0217,646This covers a period of 3  years, that is at the rate of 2,3591. per annum.The yearly salaries as at the 31st March, 1919, were Historians (2)       ............    2,000*Staff      ...............2,3134,313No useful estimate can be made of the date when this history will be completed,but the employment of more than one historian, though entailing a heavier annual cost,will no doubt be less expensive in the end.Seaborne Trade History-Nil.Mr. Fayle&apos;s salary was paid by the Garton Foundation up.to the 30th June, 1919.An agreement has been come to with the Treasury (Treasury Letter 30083/19) that from the 1st July, 1919, he shall receive a salary at the rate of 6007. a year, the totalcost of the history not to exceed 1,5007. That is to say, the history will have been produced at a yearly average cost to the Government of 2807., or 5007. per volume.The Royalty for this history as for the others will be paid to the Controller.Merchant Navy History.The yearly salaries as at the 31st March, 1919, were  Historian ... ... ... ...       500fStaff      ... ... ... ... ...       400* Will be reduced to 1,500/. on the 1st October, 1919.f Mr. Hurd devotes half his time to the work.
2,906If the work is completed by the date estimated, that is, three years from the1st August, 1918, the total cost should be 8,700/. Since, however, the light dutyofficers engaged on this work will not be available shortly, they will have to be replaced by retired officers or civilians. It will, therefore, be safe to add 1,300/. on this account for the final two years, which will bring the cost of the history (including collating ofmaterial) to 10,000/. ; that is, at a yearly average of 3,300/.The Air Ministry are anxious to take over and pay for the whole of the staff ofthis branch, except the Historian and officer in charge.Secretariat.The salaries of the permanent Staff are :  .Secretary     ... ... ... ... ...   700Confidential Clerk     ... ... ... ...   4001,100Maps.The maps for the first volume of the Naval History have been printed off (9,500copies). This had to be done as the Director-General of the Ordnance Surveyinformed us early in the year that if the maps were to be ready by the date it was proposed to publish the book (the 15th October) he must commence printing off not later than the 1st July.   This was commenced in June.The actual cost of the maps is not known, but it is believed it will be in theneighbourhood of 2,000/., which is about four times the cost originally estimated.Under the terms of the agreement between the Controller of the stationery office and the Publishers no Royalty is payable &quot;on the map volume, and it is,therefore, a matter for consideration whether the remaining volumes&apos;, if written,should not be produced without a map volume, or whether the price of the map volume,if required, should not be increased so that a Royalty could be paid on it.32. With regard to the above figures an erdeavour has been made, in the case ofthe Naval and Military histories, to separate the cost of collecting and arrangingmaterial, which has been used by the historians, from other material not necessary tothe histories.On the other hand there has been practically no expenditure, except the salaries of the authors and cost of maps for the first volume of the Naval History which wouldnot have been in any case incurred, whether the histories were being written or not.33. The expenses of the Historical Section would have been considerably higherbut for the employment of light duty officers, who otherwise would have beenunemployed, but drawing their full pay. Twenty-seven in all have been employedfrom time to time since the outbreak of war; fourteen in the Diary Branch, ten inthe Military Branch, one in the Naval, and two in the Air Branch of the Section.34. No officers fit for duty have been loaned by the War Office, and no clericalassistance given by that department.35. With regard to the cost of the Naval Branch, the item of 11,134/. includes the sums of 3,804/. for officers and 1,785/. for the junior staff, charged to the Navy Vote.This is mainly accounted for by the sum of 2,450/., representing the salary of Instructor-Commander Tuck, who has been working in the Historical Section since the warcommenced.   This officer was appointed by the Admiralty for this work because, in[1270] * EIf this history is completed by the date estimated, its total cost will amount to3,200Z.; that is, at a yearly average cost of 8701, or 1,070/. per volume.Air History.It is impossible to show the division of Staff into those necessary for collecting and arranging material and those engaged upon the Official History, as all are engaged onthe two classes of work.The salaries as at the 31st March, 1919, were : Historian  ... &apos; .      ....... ... ...     800Staff (C.I.D.

their opinion, owing to his&apos; special qualifications, no better work could be found for him to do.The Admiralty, except recently in one case, have not been able to lend light dutyofficers, as other work has always been found for them.36. In addition to the light duty officers, four voluntary workers have beenemployed in the section, one (Mr. R. de B. Layard) for practically the whole of the war.E. Y.
