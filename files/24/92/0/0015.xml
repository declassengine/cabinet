HIS. POCUIg^T 13 TH1 PROPERTY &quot;OF,, HIS BR IT AZttaiq MAJESTY&apos; S GOgH^CTTJCABIKSiT.CONTROL 0? THE be.UOR TRAPS.R^IUtoiFT JllIEilSBS.Copy of a letter from Lord J)\Aber rv on, to the President.of the 3o.aj.&apos;d of Education -Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic)Latymer House.134 Piccadilly,London, W. 1.21st October, 1919. .Dear Fisher,I doubt whether the Government sufficiently realise theimportance of re-organising&apos;completely tho arrangements for thereduction of redundant public houses.    So long as licensed premises are anything from 33$ to. $0% in excess of the number&apos;required to accommodate the public, there must continue to be a grave waste of potential revenue, and also the excessive competition induced mustbe a menace to national sobriety;   the removal of. restrictions on output obviously revives the importance of this, point aboutexcessive competition, which became somewhat obscured during thewar owing to the limitation of output.The Pill now on the stocks provides for some tightening upof the. machinery for eliminating redundancy created by the 1904 Act;while this has some value .as a recognition&apos;that some action in thomatter of redundancy is required, I cannot welcome it from anyother point of view.-I am. convinced that you will never&quot; touch ieven the fringe of redundancy until you have put fche finance of the scheme on anational instead of a local basis, and on a capital instead of anannual basis.   The fact that the finance&apos; is now on a local&apos;basis results&apos; in there being not enough money to deal at.alladequately with&apos; redundancy in the areas where redundancy, is worst.The fact that the finance is now on an annual basis meansgreat extravagance.   You .close one house, and improve its nextdoor neighbour by say&quot;$0%;   next year, when you want to close thenext door neighbour, you have to pay $0% more for it.What is wanted is the application of a large -annual sum -say  10,000.000 - taken either from the recant increase of tax-ation on alcohol or from a new increase.   The annual amount sooar-marked need be only a small percentage of the present revenue from drink of about  1^0 million a year, which.amounts could,andshould, in my opinion, be increased in the next budget.   Further,after the redundancy had been cleared up, it could and should be substantially increased again.   The annual amount to be ear-markedcould readily be capitalised or left on an annual basis, as mightbe required.SB CREI,     4C    P:     14..
prom the financial p;int of view alone, the prospective increase in the possibilities of drink taxation would make sucha scheme most profitable.   The principle of ear-marking a certainprop^rti n &apos;. f the present high scale   f taxati n t - - wards theec n-mie improvement  if the trade would als;i d;. a great deal torfc.ncile the trade to the c ntinuancc *f that scale.If the scheme which I outline is to * financial in charactert-: be suitable far inclusion in the present Licensing Bill, Isincerely hope that it will be. made clear in the debates on that bill that it is intended to introduce something of the kind inconnection with next year&apos;s Finance Act.There is no good in shirking this question because there isn. satisfactory settlement of the prink Control question whilethe redundancy p )ison remains in the system.It may be argued that the measure I.propose will be attacked on.the ground that it is a present of  56 million to the trade.My reply to this would be that it is nothing of the kind.   Ishould propose to increase the present taxation in order to pro-duce the  10 million a year.   This  10 million a year, afterrepaying the  50 million loan, would probably accrue to theGovernment as additional revenue.It is obvious that the trade would agree to increased taxa-tion more readily if - during the first few years - its producewas dev...ted to compensating dispossessed members.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)   D,&apos;A3CT0N,
