THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRELAND. 501M - Wt *J* M   IMWWIrtWM   ** f* ** -**        ** **        &quot;* ***        mThe following short appreciation docs not pretend to hemore than a cursory review of the political situation, as far as itcan be judged after a residence of a few months in one part and with-out any previous knowledge of the country.It is hoped that during the approaching tour of the coast of Ireland it will be possible to obtain further information and toform an opinion, even if it must necessarily be somewhat superficial,of the conditions prevailing in other parts of the country and thedifferent points of view held there.   On completion of the tour inquestion, such information a3 it has been possible to collect andwhich it is thought may be of interest, will be embodied in a furtherappreciation.It is pointed out however that, to obtain a complete graspof a problem which has been the despair of Statesmen and Politiciansof all shades for decades is not feasible under the circumstances butit should be possible to gain some idea of the state of the countryand of the attitude of the different political factions towards theGovernment and one another.Previous to the outbreak of the European War the mainparties in Ireland were divided into Ulsterites who stood for theUnion, Nationalists who demanded Home Rule, and Sinn Pein whose pro-gramme was somewhat vague but which embodied the principle of thedevelopment of Ireland and of Irish industries independently of West-minister, whither the eyes cf the Nationalists were constantly turned,,SinnPein since 1907 and up to 1912 Iiad tended to move towards thepolicy of the Parliamentary Party and had somewhat lapsed as a politi-cal movement, though not as a moral force,Tho Nationalist Party, as far as it represented consti-tutional Home Rule, was already losing power before the death of JohnRedmond and it is doubtful whether even the latter&apos;3 forceful - person-ality would have sufficed to maintain it at its former standard,RedmondVs death however was the final blow to the hopes of the moder-ates and the power rapidly passed into the hands of the extremists.There may now be said tc be two highly organised parties in Ireland.    Sinn Pein, with   its uncompromising demand for a Republiccompletely free from and independent of the Mother Country, andUlster, still holding out for the Union.ATTITUDE OP THE CHURCH.The attitude of the priesthood is interesting to note.They supported the movement for Home Rule, for if they had not done s0they would have lost influence with their parishioners. Again whenthe Conscription Bill was introduced, the Church threw its wholeweight into the struggle, It is undoubtedly the case that the causeof this measure being defeated was the hostility of the Church,whichaligns itself with popular opinion in continuing to protest strongly against the maintenance of British troops in Ireland.Por similar reasons the priests do not, with some excep-tions denounce the SinnPein Movement. Their attitude is that to douo would mean to lose all hold on the people and thus only make matters worse, whereas they feel that they can do more good by contentmg themselves with counsels of moderation.    Some of the. meredastardly outrages have however been vigorously condemned from thepulpit. It may be argued that the Church is in this matter opportun-1st, and that it prefers to swim with,  rather than against, the waveol popular opinion.Un the othei hand, the Church realises that its prospectsunder Siran Fein would probably suffer in comparison with thoseobtaining.....
1  i &apos;jl 502obtaining under the present regime, and that in educational matters,at any rate, the advent of a republic would probably bring sweepingchanges. But this statement must be qualified by the faot that the sinn Fein movement has undoubtedly reany adherents among the youngermembers of tho priesthood, trained at Maynooth College, Dublin.THE REBELLION. OP 1916The Easter Week- Rebellion of 1916 was the product of asmall number of extremists, Members of the Citizen Army, it was de&quot;nouncod by the vast majority ot&apos;Irishmen of all shades of politics,though many, who were in heart opposed to it, throw in their lot withthe rebels when they saw that things had moved too far to be stopped,and paid for it with their lives,   But the aftermath of tho rebellionproduced results whioh far surpassed the most sanguine hopes of itsoriginators. The series of trials, imprisonments and executions pro-longsd from day to day and drawn cut for a long period could not be without effect on tho minds of a people by nature admirers of the fighter, emotional and idealistic.It cannot be denied that the men who went to their deathsin 1916, did so far an ideal, however misplaced, and without flinch-,ing. . &quot; &apos;*The natural corollary was their et.ovation to the martyrscrown and an enormous stimulus to the Sinn Fein Cause notably amongthe women of the country.   Sinn Fein clubs sprung up with a mushroom-like growth and the movement became the dominant political factionoutside, but not entirely outside Ulster.PROSPECTS OF. ANOTHER REBELLION. -It is not thought that a repetition of Easter Week 1916is at all likely. The large number of English troops in Ireland, thegreater mobility enjoyed by the use of tanks, armoured cars andaeroplanes, all contrive to make the prospects of a successful risingmo3t unlikely.   Many of the leaders of 1916 have been removed fromthe field of action and the other participators have had all thefighting they desired. But they will continue to pursue their presenttactics of guerilla warfare, consisting in the shooting of policemenand military, raids for arms, &amp;c,Reports of outbreaks on a wide scale as being the probablesequence if the new government scheme of settlement comes to nothing,emanate mostly from Nationalist sources and are put about with an object.SINNFEIK ORGANISATION.There is no doubt that the military organisation of SinnFein is extremely good and worked out in admirable detail. The dis-position of the units and the names of the officers in command arekept most secret, but a largo amount of information on this point isin the hands of the military authorities and more is continuallybeing obtained. The extraordinary secrecy which cloaks all movements of Sinn Fein is however an outstanding feature of this organisationat the present time.The weak point of the Irish Republican Army is their equipment. Previous to Mr. Birre&apos;11&apos;s regime, permits were required from the Resident Magistrate, known as *Red Licences&apos; for the pur-chase of any firearm.   In 1906 however the Peace Preservation Act wasrepealed, there *;as no limitation on the import of firearms,and thecountry was flooded -uth cheap revolvers.The armament of the I.R.A. can still however only be des-cribed as motley, consisting for the most part of shotguns andrevolvers and bombs , of a primitive character, and the daring raidswhich are continuously being made to secure rifles &amp;c, are the bestevidence that the I,R,A. recognise their weakness in this respect.It is not possible to ascertain the approximate number of weapons
obtained by this means.That there are a very large number of concealed arras therecan be no doubt, but it is extremely doubtful if the ammunition forthem is available in any quantity and, as stated above, their value is questionable,ULSTER ORGANISATION.^Ulster is in a rather different position. A very largenumber of rifles undoubtedly remained in the country after the gun-running episodes. At that time Ulster organisation was far in act-vahce of anything that the rest of Ireland could boast of.The &quot;Times&quot; estimate in December 1913 was that between30,000 and 40,000 rifles and 20,000 pistols had been sent to IrelandMilitary arrangements were very elaborate and ColonelRepington spoke most highly of the personnel, training, and equipment of the Ulster Volunteer Army,   Ulster also had plenty of funds andhad been anticipating the necessity of aimed resistance for some timeXTATIOHAL VOLUNTEERS,-It was only when the success of the Ulster gun-runningcoup was realised, that the Rationalists considered it necessary tofollow suit with an organisation on the same lines. The Irish Volun-teer Movement was started in November 1913 by the issue of a mani-festo by the nationalists followed by an inaugural meeting of theVolunteers in Dublin composed of young men including members of theParliamentary party, moderate Sinn Seiners, and a few idealists andextremists; of these latter some of the Sinn Pein Party and some ofthe idealists gradually became extremists and merged with theRevolutionists,The new movement met with hostility on the part of llr.Redmond and the Parliamentary leaders who disliked independent actionon the part of their followers, and who had not been consulted withregard to it.,.&apos;:Drilling however now became very popular in the South,andthe Irish Parliamentary Party came to the conclusion that the Volun-teer   Movement must be accepted, and Mr.Redmond insisted on a major-ity on the Committee of well known supporters of the party.When however Mr. Redmond sought to induce both the Ulsterand the Irish Volunteers to combine for the common defence of theEmpire against Germany and put forward his recruiting programme,cer-tain leaders of the Volunteers issued a manifesto repudiating Mr.Rediaond&apos;s leadership and a split took place in the organisation. Themajority adhered to Llr. Redmond and became known as the national Vbl-unteers as opposed to the Irish Volunteers who had seceded,A proclamation prohibiting the importation of arms intoIreland was now again issued by the Government. This left the Ulstermen unperturbed. They boasted that they had already sufficient armsand could procure more if necessary. The Nationalists were howeverin a different case, and it did seem that they had reason-to suspectthe motives of the Government which put- obstacles in the way of theSouthern Volunteers after having allowed the Convenanters ample timein which to equip themselves. *Consequent on the rupture between the National volunteers and the Irish Volunteers a new factor came into play in the shape ofthe active support of the latterby the extreme Irish-American organi-sations in the United States, This resulted firstly in supplying the Irish Volunteers on a fairly liberal scale with funds; secondly,as a price of continued support,  the Volunteers were urged into moreviolent courses than their leaders would otherwise have been preparedto embark upon, and thirdly, ,it formed a connecting link between theIrish Volunteers on the one hand and the German Government on thegther^   This last feature was exploited to the utmost by Roger
It was at this stage that&apos;the Sinn Fein military organisation commenced to develop on lines which rapidly led to ahigh state of efficiency and which is probably quite equal to thatof Ulster, If it does not surpass itcThe Citizen ^rmyof James Conolly was an organisationindependent of the Irish Volunteers?   The latter stood for nationalityin its extreme form, while the former represented the doctrine ofInternational Syndicalism as introduced by James Larkino while bothforces vero therefore pursuing somewhat different aims, they had one point in common in that both, though for different reasons,represen-ted the forces of revolutionary change and through this medium, whilethe organisations remained distinct and separate, a working alliancewas established.   This combination was largely brought about by theexertions of James Conolly and Countess Larcievicz, who realised the potentialities l^ing In a fusion of the Irish Volunteer and CitizenArmiesTHE POLICE :..ND SINN FEIN TERRORIST METHODS ,while no words are adequate to describe the magnifi-cent courage of the R .1 oC a in tho face of the repeated attacks, often-coupled with extreme brutality, of which they have been the target of late, it is a fact that the police are undoubtedly getting some-what nervous.  .Whether recruiting for the force is being affected toany extent is not at present certain-..-   It Is not only the fact thatthe police themselves are attacked but that their relatives andfriends are subjected to a very systematic form of terrorism andboycot oNotices will be posted up in the country informingall and sundry that anybody seen talking to policemen, supplying themwith food or in any way assisting them will pay for it, and the threat is no empty one.&apos;   Terrorism on a wide scale is nowarecognisedweapon of Sinn Fein and private persons are equally subject to it.There is probably no more conservative body of men than the Irishfarmers, but if they in any way co-operate against Sinn Fein theirstacks may be burnt, their cattle driven off, horses shot,  etc   and,-bitterly opposed as many of them are to the movement, they wouldprobably vote Sinn Fein in self defence.Among the worst places on the South and V:est Coasts ofIreland may be mentioned \,aterford, Kinsale, which has been bad of late, but possesses no leaders and probably will not mature into -anything serious j   Skibbereen,, Schull, Castletown, Ga^liersiveen &quot;and-.Lauragh,. Eyeries, Clare, iestport.   In Galway the disturbances are.mostly agrarian in character. rATTITUDE TOWARDS ENGLISH TROOPS.While Ulster regards the Army of occupation tion withequanimity, It Is bitterly resented by both SirmFein and Nationaliststhe latter regarding it as an infringement of the sovereign rightsof the people.     The relations between the military and thepopulation are however uniformly good, the recent Fermoy disturbancesform no criterion of the general state of feeling, and the populacealso profits commercially by the presence of military units *LABOUR AND SINN FEINSinn Fein has tried to capture Irish Labour and the ;--latter has acquiesced, as may bo evidenced by. the fact that Sinn. &apos;: .Fein called a workless day in connection with the agitation against .conscription.. .\
conscription and labour came in; the anniversary of this day wassimilarly observed.   Dublin Labour is almost to a man Sinn Fein*But tho troubles headed by James Larkin in Dublin six years agowere purely Bolshevik in character and not political., and there donot appear to bo any leading Sir.mFo5.nors among the members of theIrish Transport Workers1&apos; Unions   In this connection it may be notedC-hat Dublin offers a fruitful field for Bolshevik propaganda and itis believed that Bolshevik doctrines.are obtaining a considerablehold on a section of the population from amongst the elements ofwhich the Citison Army was formed*It does not appear to be the general policy of SinnPein to call strikes in support of political demands, but they would undoubtedly make use of strikes to further their political ends * andthere is evidence that they were prepared to do this had the railway strike spread to Ireland&quot;   The measures contemplated were on a widescale and included acta of sabotage such as destruction of bridges,blowing in cf tunnels, &amp;CoAs regards England, Sinn &quot;Pein is jealous of the EngllsLabour Party nor does it seem to have any present understanding with-it *   It has no faith in the socialistic attempts of Labour *   (It maybe noted by the way that one of the reasons why Belfast working menare anti-Home Rulers is because their employers encourage them to beso, since it has the effect of turning their thoughts from industrialagitation and preventing them combining with other labour elements inthe country of different political persuasion?   They have probably not progressed sufficiently far as to ask themselves whether or nothey would be better off under Home Rule)NAVAL AND DOCKYARD PERSONNEL.As far as this particular port is concerned there isno connection between the Navy and Sinn Fein.; nor is it thought thatthe former are in any degree influenced by political propaganda * Thegeneral attitude of the&apos;services is extremely hostile to Sinn Peinpropaganda in any forme   The same cannot be said of. the Dockyardemployees who are probably SinnPein to a man. but the latter alsorealise very acutely where their interests &apos; lie andrefrain from any outward manifestations of their political leanings e-As regards Coast Guard Stations and V/ar SignalStations it is believed to be the general policy of the A.0.R, for various reasons, that ratings should not be drawn from the district-in which they have their homes, but from some distance away*   Theregulations against intimacy with the local populace are verystrictly enforced.   One case only has como to light in this districtwhere a man was found to be married to a Sinn Peiner and they werepromptly moved to Scotland.   It is believed that on this Ipartof the coast the men are perfectly loyal and reliable-This opinion is combatted to a certain extent fromother sources.   During the war, the service was necessarily under-mannedj and the new entries were undoubtedly open to suspicion,in some cases *It is felt however that this is a point which can hardly be adequately represented until a tour of the country has bebeen completed and personal investigation has enabled a cleareridea to be formed on the subject.The Customs and Postal Service are undoubtedlyinfected. It has been reported that arms are being smuggled in small quantities through Limerick and South Coast ports, and that thereis reason to believe that the Customs officers have In somo casesconnived. *...*
connived at thise. It must be confessed, however that, so far no con-crete case of such smuggling has been brought to lightoATTITUDE OP CONTENDING FACTIONS TOIARDS THE GOVERNMENT AND ONE ANOTHER.It is&apos; not easy to describe the real attitude of SinnFein towards any policy.the Government might embark upon. There aremoderate and extreme Sinn Fein elementst. The precursors of the latter were the Fenians) and.lt is the Fenian policy of outrages which theyhave adopted *The difficulty is that one does not, so to speak, meetSinn Feinc   They keep themselves apart- from Home Rulers and other parties, and the whole movement is enveloped with the closest secrecy.Sinn Fein has always opposed Home Rule for tacticalreasons and to safeguard their flank being turned by the extremistsSinn Fein would probably however accept a^JLarg^ measureof Home Rule, but ifi this were coupled with partition the result is uncertain *The difference between Sinn Fein and the Nationalistsis that the Nationalists were a party with a policy, whereas   SinnFein has been described as an emotional dissipation^Certain. Sinn Feiners consider that their best policyis to wait until the present Government is replaced by a labour government which is nut committed to any pledgesj while Labour inEngland has always been pro Home Rule, if the Labour Party came into power it would probably refuse to admit the idea of self determination.Some form of the scheme of &quot;county option&quot; partition ffor   six years put forward by the Government in Larch 1914 i,P.Pc]43of 1914) would have been accepted by the Nationalists but was refusedby Ulster whose minimum was the permanent exclusion of six counties,when the project was renewed by kr-;Lloyd George in 1916 after the rebellion, both LrfRedmond and Sir E.Carson got their followers toaccept the exclusion of six counties, but the agreement fell throughowing to a dispute as to the term of exclusion and a modification ofthe Government1s proposal as to the representation of Ireland in theImerpial Parliament (see Cdc 833.0) *The Nationalists, especially the members of the parHa-mentary party, considered that the offer made to them and accepted withreluctance had been moot materially changed to their disadvantageat the instigation of Lord Lansdowne and the Ulster Unionist Party*The announcement of the Prime minister of a belated application of conscription to Ireland on the very day of the publication of theConvention1s report, was regarded by the Nationalists as a deliberate&apos;torpedoeing of the self-government proposals to which the PrimeLintster was considered to have pledged the Government in his letterto the Chairman of the Convention two months earlier *The result is that the Nationalists do not trust Hr*Lloyd George and consider he Is entirely under the influence of sir edward Carson*Rightly or wrongly IJister^is considered by Nationalistsand Sinn Feiners alike to be the enfant gate&apos; of the English Govern-ment. and it is felt that so long as the Government remains In powerthere is little to be hoped from it..The Irish Question is regarded by some as a religious,by others as a political, and again by others as a racial question.Ulster a *.*
Ulster fears the yoke of the Roman Church, the Nationalists putforward the League of Nations Covenant and the solf determination ofsubject nationalities as the basis of their demands, while Sinn Feinpersists in the view that Ireland is a separate nation.   All three;,parties are waiting for the Government to come to a decision. -All: three parties have beforehand condemned any possible solution as &quot;beingimpracticable. There seems to bo no halfway between the maintenanceof the Union, complete independence, or Dominion Home Rule with or without the Inclusion of Ulster.   The prospect of either of these threeI solutions being accepted by all three contending parties seems atpresent remote. .        &quot; &apos;If however tho Government took a strong line and; imposed   a form of Self-Government on Ireland and then left it tothe Irish to; settle matters among themselves, it is believed that\ the Nationalists and Sinn Pein would accept it and make the best ofIt, at any rate as a modus vivendi.   The point that must beemphasized is that the days of Conventions arc past, since it is felt that whatever the Government promised, they would not carryout and that there Is no point In indulging in deliberations which would lead to nothing.   Not until Self-Government is an accomplished fact,will it be possible to judge how It is received by the majorityof the Irish people.
