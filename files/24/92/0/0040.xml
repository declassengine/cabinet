The decisionof the Cabinet was that the policy then recommended bythe Admiralty should be adopted in principle and thatthe measures necessary to give effect to it should besettled by the Board of Trade in concert with theShipping C controls  oller.The question has been discussed with representativesof the Shipowners Associations who claimed that certaincommercial disadvantages entailed by the adoption of thepolicy were not outweighed by the probable advantage intime of war.   The matter has now been further consideredby the Admiralty and though they still consider that the defensive armament of individual ships is a very desirableprecaution, they are of the opinion that having regard tothe large expense involved,and to the altered conditionssince the war Cabinet decision on the 28th May, theprovision of stiffening in merchant vessels generallyshould not now be made obligatory,   The Shipping controller and the Board of Trade concur in this view, and it istherefore submitted that no further action be taken Inthe matter.(Signed) A.
