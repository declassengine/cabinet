$&amp;&amp;2SBS8 J* the Pr0Dertv nf-----.....I^/vXO  ---^- Jr ^v  \\     Imports and Exports Regulations bill memorandum by the Food controller.     I regret that the revised draft of this Bill should have beenreprinted without my Department being given any opportunity offurnishing observations to the Committee on tho proposed changes bywhich tho Bill has been modified to a Very marked extent.     Theoriginal draft was agreed between the Secretary of the Board ofTrade and the Secretary of ray Department.2,     Part 4 of the original draft under, tho heading &quot;Regulation of exports&quot; contained two provisions of considerable value   The first,(Clause 16 (i)) enabled temporary restrictions on exports generally to be continued for a period of three years from the termination ofthe war: the second (sub-clause 16 (3) enabled the. Board of Tradeto prohibit the exportation to any country or place specified inthe Order of any articles of food or drink or any materials used inthe manufacture or preparation thereof.3,    As regards the existing restrictions it is hoped to withdrawmany of these during the next few months, but whatever decision maybe arrived at as respects the existing restrictions, I considerthat it is essential that power should be reserved in the Bill toregulate the export of foodstuffs., It is obvious that unlimitedexport may not only diminish supplies&apos;, but may also raise/to thelevel of the effective continental demand. prices4u     Clause 16 of the revised draft is plainly unsatisfactory.Power is taken to prohibit the exportation of meat, but not of livestock) of wheat, but not of flour; of edible fats, hut not of the raw materials out of which they are made; and of sugar, but not ofarticles containing sugar. The list should in my opinion clearly be modified so as to include nil foodstuffs in respect of which pro-duction is encouraged and of articles necessary for securing suchproduction; namely, cereals and cereal products, meat and live stock,butter and cheese; oleaginous seeds, nuts and kernels and the pro-ducts thereof; sugar and any articles containing sugar.Again, while it is not desired to prohibit the export of potatoes from Ireland to Foreign countries altogether, it is desir-able that this country should have preferential right of shipments,as is the case at the present time.5*     While I should much have preferred to retain clause 16 as it stood in the original draft, I realise that it would now be diffi-cult to re-Insert this clause in full. I feel, however, that It isessential for the purpose of maintaining supplies and of stabilisingprices that power should be taken to. regulate the exportation of foodstuffs. The food situation is so shifting that it is impossibleto say beforehand to what articles it may be necessary to apply this power.   If a general clause is confined to foodstuffs only I do notbelieve that it will meet with serious opposition.6. I ask therefore that all foodstuffs may be omitted from the new clause 16 (i) and that an additional sub-clause be added as follows&quot;The Board may by Order prohibit the exportation toany country or place specified In the Order of anyarticles of food or drink or any materials used inthe production, manufacture or preparation of any sucharticle o&apos;ministry OF FOOD G-LO.
