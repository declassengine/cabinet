(THIS DOCUMENT ,IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),&quot;&apos; .....HWMiWKWMiimi      i ................................i  ........ , ,,, ,    I,.,,..,................   ........i......i  ,,,,.............mmm*mmmmmmmmmwmAmSECRET. ^) CABINET.HOUSING.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,I have before me the memorandum of the Ministerof Health (numbered CP.3).     I am not sure that Iclearly understand his plan for the intervention of&apos;the Board of forks in the provision of houses for localauthorities.     If I do understand it, it would result inthe Government having to finance the provision *f houses in anticipation of reimbursement by the local authorities.I deprecate the direct intervention of the Board ofISorks if It can oy any possibility be avoided, and thememorandum does not make clear to me either its necessityr?r the advantages v,hich are expected to accrue from it.In any case the burden placed upon the Exchequer by thehousing scheme both in future annual outlay and in immediate borrowing on capital account Is so onerousthat I cannot contemplate with equanimity any scheme &quot;?hichwould result in an additional charge upon the Exchequerand additional borrowing on account of the Local loans fund during the early stages of the scheme.tt may be right to abandon the plan of competitivetenders but great care will be necessary in that case tosee that the prices fixed are not excessive,I have already dealt with the proposed controlof wages and building operations, the efficacy andpracticability of which I doubt.   The object of the present memorandum ia to call attention to the danger that thescheme nbv&apos; sketched by the Minister of Health will increase at least temporarily and probably permanentlythe liability of the Treasury on capital account ata moment v;hen we shall be hard put to it to find thecapital required to meet existing liabilities, and tosuggest that if any scheme of the kind contemplated isto be accepted by the Government it must be recast so asto give us complete protection against this danger,(Intd.)   A, C,reasury, &quot;S.W.I.7=11,19.
