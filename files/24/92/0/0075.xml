S &quot;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS 3RIMPI0 MAJESTY&apos;S GCVERMSMT)CABINET.^ ------0 R E ,T.     A HOUSING AMD LABOURP. 74.        LyJfote by the Chancellor of the Ex chequer.II circulate to the Cabinet a note of a conversation between Sir David Shackleton and Mr. Wilson of the LabourDepartment and Sir Malcolm Ramsay, Controller of AdministrationServicesj and ether officers of the Treasury.The position is a very grave one and I desire to pressagain that a public appeal be mads to the building trade unions to open their doors to new labour.     Cur whole building pro-gramme is being jeopardised by the trade selfishness of Hastersand men and, as pointed out by Sir David, their action may havemost unfortunate results in other trades and throughout theGovernment establishments.(Intel.) A.treasury, S.W.7th. November, 1919.Sir David Shackleton and Mr. H.J. Wilson came over tesee Sir Malcolm Ramsay on the 30th October with regard to thequestion cf co-ordinating the treatment by Government Depart-ments of wage questions, and especially in regard to building trade wages.     Mr. Barstow was present during the discussion.iSir David said that the Ministry sf Labour was seriouslyalarmed at the constant rise in wages which was taking placein the Building Trade, due to the shortage of skilled labour andthe competition among employers, many of whom were working on government Contracts and had no inducement to keep down wages.Agreements made last May were being revised before the expirydate/-1-
date and the rate had now risen in Liverpool to 2s. ah hourand he expected that in London the rate mi$ht shortly be 2.g&amp;.an hour with a reduction of the weekly hours to 44.     The Ministryof Labour was quite powerless in present conditions to controlthese advances, and he instanced the case in which the Court ofArbitration had twice turned down an application for ah increase,and the local employers had subsequently granted it, so that theincreased rate had to be recognised- by the Ministry as the dis-trict rate under the Fair Wages Clause.-He pointed out&apos; that two consequences followed;.(1) All Housing Schemes will become absolutely uneconomical.Por example, the extra 4d. an hour, he anticipated, would meanan annual increase of rent of a. working class dwelling by 2/lOd.per week, and, at present costs, the minimum economic rent for.a workman1 B cottage in the London areas would be 30s-.. a week.Of course, under the Housing Acts a large part of the extra cost would fall on the Exchequer, but he thought that the time would come when the Government would simply have to say that it couldnot go on.(2) The increases to the Building Trade would start a freshcycle of wage advances throughout all industry.     The Court cfArbitration was at present hearing claims for a 15s. advance forthe Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades and it would be quite impossible to keep them below the rate actually obtained by theBuilding labourers.     Any increase, however, awarded to the engineers will spread to Corporation employees and to the CivilService and would entail a further heavy burden cn the Exchequer.Three methods of remedying the situation were discussed;(a) Licensing of building operations.     Sir David saidthat he had long pressed for the re-introduction of the Warrequirement in regard to licensing of building., and he understoodthat Dr. Addison had now asked the Cabinet to approve this,This/-2-
&quot;This would be most Important as a step towards restricting the demand for building labour,     /t the present time in some districts nearly 90$ of the labour available was being employedby private employers, partly for the erection of factories andshops but also largely for Cinemas and such like properties,the profits to be obtained from which were so great that theywere ready to build at any cost.     The result was that GovernmentHousing Schemes came last instead of first in the order of priority for supplies of labour.     Mr. Barstow pointed out thegreat political difficulty of getting any licensing scheme appro-ved by the House of Commons.- . (b) As a second step Sir David Shackleton pressed that theMinistry of Health should not allow local Authorities to place.open Contracts (.i.e., Contracts in which there is the provision that any additional increase of wages can be&apos; added to the Contracts!:Until this was done employers would have no inducement to restrictwage advances.    (A side issue in this connection was that onthe Building Council &quot;cross&quot; voting prevails, i,e, if oneemployer, who may be working a Time and Line Contract, votes withthe workmen, his &quot;ote is sufficient to carry an increase againstthe votes cf all the other employers,     The Ministry of - labour has suggested to the employers that this arrangement should be altered).   ,Mr. BarSuow fully agreed that the financial arrangements in regard to housing were of a most unfortunatecharacter, but he thought that the Ministry of Health would regard it as impossible to get on with the schemes unless theyhad. open Contracts.     He understood that Dr3 Addiaon was con-contemplating direct,building by the Office of Works where theLocal Authorities failed to get on with their schemes.(3) Mr. Barstow, however, suggested that the real remedy wasto increase the supply of labour. Sir David Shackleton saidthat they had been negotiating for a long time with thes TradeUnions/
Unions on this subject but found them very conservative.     they pointed out that before the War the Building Trade suffered verymuch from unemployment and they were determined not to increasethe numbers of their men to such&apos;an extent that when theHousing Schemes were tinished there would be a slump.     Theyabsolutely refused to discuss any question of dilution and theMinistry of Labour had only got about 30 ex-soldiers in training as bricklayers.   He felt that there was no hope of any sub-stantial increase of the supply in this way.Sir David Shackleton finally urged that the treasury should help the Ministry of Labour in trying to get some steps taken to remedy the present deadlock.
