CHURCHILL.5th November, 1919.4822I attach a memorandum by Lieut.-Colonel Maude on openings for Britishcapital in Germany, and the possible developments in Russia. The object of thepaper is to combat the idea that nothing that we can do will prevent Germany fromsecuring the economic domination of Russia, and to show that we may possibly be ableto do so ourselves, by first securing control of German industries.N. MALCOLM, Major-General,Chief of the British Military Mission,1, Moltkestrasse, Berlin.1. There appears to be a universal impression in England at the present time thatthe Russian market, when it becomes open to trade, is bound to be secured by Germany.The prospect is, if anything, viewed with relief in England, under the belief that it willeliminate Germany as a trade rival to England.2. This belief is based on a complete misapprehension of the position of Germanysfinance, credit and manufacturing capacity at the present time.3. The real position of Germany is that she has no raw material, and no money forbuying raw material at the present rate of exchange for her home requirements, still lessfor the Russian market. Such commercial relationship as exists between Russia andGermany, is based on pre-war business associations and the keeping-up of correspondence with a view to ultimate trade possibilities.4. It is true that certain factories in the occupied zone are working at full pressure,and it is probable that a false impression of prosperity is being allowed to attractattention in the English Press and. in the public mind, owing to the fact that conditions in the occupied zone are better known to the British public than thosein the rest of Germany. In unoccupied Germany, work is practically at a standstill,and will remain so throughout the winter, in spite of the growing desire of the Germanworkman to return to his pre-war labours. Such factories as are working in occupiedGermany are very largely supplied through unauthorized channels, whilst the factories in un-occupied Germany are working from &quot; hand to mouth.&quot;5. The majority of German industries at the present time are for sale at bankruptprices, i.e., one-fifth of their face value, and in many cases less, on account of the rateof exchange, and on account of depreciation and lack of facilities for developing trade.6. No country, up to date, has come forward and offered Germany any substantialcredit, which will enable her to fulfil any International trade promises. Her output, inany case for many months to come, must be absorbed in her home markets.7, If the possibilities of the German market at the present time were properlyunderstood in England, it would quickly be realized that it is within the power ofBritish capitalists to get control for an indefinite period of practically every factory inGermany, and, through Germany, of Russia. By so doing, England would then havean effective weapon for preventing German trade ever becoming a menace to Englishtrade, and at the same time, open up unlimited markets for herself.8. Germany at the present time has practically no manufactured goods to dumpon any country, and everything that her factories can turn out for many months tocome will be required for her home market.(B19/502)  90  11/19  H&amp;S  764-two
If the English capitalist secures control of the German factories now, he would forthe next few months be selling anything such factories turned out to the ^Germans, andwould then be ready to place them on the Kussian market through such Germanfactories.   In other words, he would go into Bussia on the back of Geiinany.In such factories he should put in British representatives preferably demobilizedofficers, who are now looking for openings. Such men would learn their trades, and atthe same time be in a position to watch the trend of German trade development untilthe Russian market is open, and would then be ready to invade the Eussian market.9.&apos;. As illustrations of the various German concerns which are for sale, or of whichthe controlling interest can be acquired, the following, chosen at random, may beq uoted :  -The Berliner Telefon Fabrik.The Hoffreguenz Companie.   (Wireless.)Waggonbauanstalt Liiders   (A very important railway wagon factory.)Bote Steel Factory      ...   This is a steel factory, started during the war.   It is&apos;at present only capable of employing about 600 700 workmen, but has unlimited possibilities, and isthe only steel works in the Berlin area,Sudicatis...      ...      ...   A concern that supplies the steel studs for motortyres. It has a very big connection in Sweden,Holland and Denmark.The Fabank     ...      ...   A syndicate that owns the timber rights of many ofthe forests in Serbia, Montenegro and Boumania.Schlesinger und Tryer ...   A banking syndicate which operates over a wideindustrial field. Through this bank, English capitalcould obtain the control of concerns like theHamburg-America and the North German Lloyd(which are not open to foreign capital at present),and Westphalian coalfields.Any number of hotels, all over Germany, e.g., Kaiserhof in Berlin and the atlantic in Hamburg.Further to existing and &quot;going&quot; concerns, several important wireless and aviationinventions are awaiting exploitation; owing to lack of material and facilities inGermany, they can be secured by foreign countries.10. German)&apos; at the present moment is threatened with the possibility of the collapse of the internal value of the mark. Such an internal collapse would probably have already taken place if certain facts were generally known, e.g., that under thePeace terms, the amount of paper currency issued to Belgium, France and Alsace,which Germany has to.redeem at par, is approximately 10 milliards of marks.11. It would appear that an energetic and skilfully conducted campaign maybenecessary to get the full advantage of the unlimited markets, which can be secured for england, by encouraging English capitalists and manufacturers to finance, supply andcontrol the German factories which are now standing idle. Such a campaign mighthave to take the form of a frank avowal that previous utterances were for war purposesonly, and were in no way binding to our peace programme.As soon as a loan is made to Germany, the value of the property thus acquiredwill increase simultaneously with the appreciation of the mark.12 Danish and Swedish capitalists have already secured small interests inGermany on the lines indicated above, and a number of Americans have &quot; made enquiries,&quot; but the main arteries are still untouched.Beyond a few Jewish traders of English citizenship who have negotiated small, and,in some cases, doubtful transactions, no serious movement has been made by Englishcapitalists.13. A move, however, on the above lines, should not be delayed, if the mark is toretain its internal value, and the eastern market made secure for British trade.14. The above general observations are based on statistics of many private firms inun-occupied Germany, and from conversations with the leading financial houses.C. E. Maude,Lieutenant- Colonel.17th October, 1919.
