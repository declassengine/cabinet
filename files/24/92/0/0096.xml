B I N E ft.CP. 95. &apos;..PHBag BONDS..Note, by the Chancellor of the exchequer.I circulate to the Cabinet a letter from the Governor ofthe Bank of England.The more I ocnsidar the prospects of such an issue the moreI dinlike the idea,.It will not brins in big money.It will very probably result in large withdrawals from the savings Banks and War savings Certificates.It will direct public attention to speculation and gamblingohances ef wealth at a time v&amp;en it is more than usually inn-port ant to check speculation and concentrate en the inorease ofproduction.It vail render the administration of-the ordinary lawagainst lotteries and the like impossible.I may add that it will cffend a great body cf organised   -opinion n^t at present unfriendly to the Government.(intld.)   A.C.Treasury, s.\7,11th November, 1919.Bank of England.7th November, 1919.Dear Mr. Chancellor,I prumisedtM give you the gist :f the Report of theCommittee of the House of Commons in 1808 upon Lottery Loans,and I new enclose a few extracts from it which&apos;I hope you willoirculate with the recent committee&apos;s Report.   In spite ofincessant legislation it was found impossible (as I believe italways vriii be) to secure the monopoly of Lotteries for Govern-ment purposes.Although I am not yet olear (and am trying to ascertain)%        whether in all the pottery loans before that date the/investor4 received back his principal intact either in cash or in stook,it is clear that in many cases he did and that in some cases he received a certain amount of interest on his money as wellas the chance of a prize.
That is to say the Premium Bond is no new thing andmust &quot;bo considered as included in the indictment of theCommittee of 180&amp;.Moreover, I am decidedly of opinion that if theGovernment is to ho induced to trade on the gamblinginstincts of the community the wovat way to do so ie toissue a Premium Bond carrying interest as well as largeprizes.     My chief reason for this&apos; is that if you are to payinterest at all you cannot well pay less than 2% per annum and you will then he much more likely to attract large Bumsfrom the Loposits in the Savings Banks.   There are also thereasons that the payment of interest on a multitude of Bondsof small denomination would he very troublesome and costly,and that a modified gamble will not act as such a powerfulcounter attraction to the out and out gamble of the FrenchLottery Loan.I would also submit that the longer the term of anyLottery or Premium Bond Loan that Parliament may desire you to issue the longer will be the period&apos;during which thecheerful list of vices enumerated by the 1808 Committee wouldbe encouraged.Perhaps you will excuse my recapitulating here thepoint is. which I raised in conversation with you the otherevening.(l)   A Premium Bond or Lottery Loan will not attract&quot;big money&quot; and therefore, though the applications might bevery numerous, the. total amount subscribed cannot be largeunless the bulk of it is drawn from the Savings Banks or thesale      War Savings Certificates, which would mean pure loss to bclh borrower and lender.(2)    Such an issue is the very negation of the spiritof thrift and economy which has been so laboriously inculcatedby the War Savings Association, and(3)   An issue of that kind in a country with such a financial,reputation as ours, would certainly to some extentdamage our credit abroad.The one point in favour of such an issue is that itwould probably attract a certain amount of cash from hoards,But as these hoards must consist chiefly of paper their investment would mean chat the Government would require topay in interest or prises on what arc at present loans free of interest... Yours sincerely,(Signrd)    ERIEN COKAYNE.The Right honourable the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
EXTRACT PROM SECOND RgjORT FROM THE COMMITTEE?,&apos; 485ON THE LAWS R3SPBQTIMG LOTTERIES, 1800.In truth, tho foundation of the Lottery is so radi-oally vicious, that Your Commlttoo-foel convinced that,undor no system of regulations which can to devised, willit &quot;be possible for Parliament to adopt it as an efficientsource of Revenue, and at the same time divest it of allthe Evils and Calamities of which it has hitherto provedso &quot;baneful a source.A spirit of adventure must &quot;bo oxclted amongst thocommunity, in order that Government may derive from it apecuniary resource.    The spirit is to be chocked at acertain given point, in order that no Evils may attend it-tfao latter object has not hitherto been attained; with allthe pains which have boon bestowed upon it.   Your Committeearc of opinion, that its attainment is impossible.Tho ingenuity of Psrsona interested in breaking thoLaw, is always upon the watch for its new Enactments, andhas hitherto always baffled tho sagacity of tho legislature.added to which, there can be no hopo of greater purityamongst the persons employocf to detect and bring Offendersto punishment than has boon hitherto experienced, or thannow exists.   Tho Statute Bock is burthencd with regulationsentirely repugnant to the spirit of the Constitution,rigorous and oppressive in tho extreme, which, if theyare ever executed, fall only upon the Ignorant and dostit&amp;towhilst the wealthy and mors profligate hold them in uttercontempt: and this unseemly state of things Is allov/odto continue, In ordor that the Stato may derive a certainannual sum from the partial encouragement of a Vice, whichit is the object cf tho Law, in all other cases, and. atall other times, most diligently to ropross.In the meantime, Your Comnittee find, that by tho -effects of the Lottery, even undor its present restrictionsidleness, dissipation and poverty are increased, the mo3tsacred and confidential trusts are betrayed, domesticcomfort is destroyed, madness ofton created, crimes,subjecting the perpetrators of them to the punishment of death, are committed, and oven suicide itself is produced,as will fully appear by tho Evidence submittod to thoHouso,   Such have been the constant and fatal attendantsupon Stato lotteries, and such Your Committee have toogood ground to foar will be their invariable attendants solong as they are suffered, under whatevor chocks or regulations, to exist.The question naturally occurs to Your Committee,whether any pecuniary advantage, howevor largo or conven-ient, oan compensate to a State for the amount of Vice andMisery thus necessarily produced by tho levy of It.Tho answer to thi3 question is submitted to Yourwisdom and deliberation.   But in ordor that the House may come to a decision, in every view so important to theinterests and happiness of tho community, withoutprejudice, Your Committee cannot conclude without express-ing a decided opinion, that tho pecuniary advantagederived from a Stato Lottery, is much greater in appear-anco than in reality.
