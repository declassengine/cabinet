f REPORT OF IUTEH-DEI?AH&apos;JMEIf IDA 1 GOMfiMlBB ON&apos;vMEAT SUPPHES.Meoorandan- by the president of the Board of Trade.I.submit for the information of the War Cabinet the Reportof on Inter-Dop art mental Committee which was appointed by mein April last with the following reference;-nto consider and report on the means ofsecuring sufficient meat supplies for theUnited Kingdom at reasonable prices, withspecial regard to the development of meatproduction in the United Kingdom and in theBritish Overseas Dominions and to theprotection of British markets and of producing countries within the Empire -from domination of foreign organisations11.  -The; conclusions and reoomioendations of the Qoma&amp;ttee are -Bet out on pages ZZ - 28 of the Report.    Most of these &apos;recommendations are unanimous, but the committee were unableto agree as regards allowing the Importation of Store Cattlefrom Canada, and certain members of the Committee made specialrecommendations (page 88) for encouraging British Meat companies^operating in South America and as to the d.e sir ability of theGovernment having power to control insulated shipping.(1)   Some of the recommendations do not primarily doncern,the. Board of Trade, and with regard&apos;to these I malm no comment.!it*h those of the unanimous recommendations which are ofdireot interest to the. Board of Trade J am in general agreement^Upon these, and upon the recommendations which were not madeunanimously. I desire to offer the following observations.(a)Control of the Meat Trade,   (pages 124 and  5)par agrapEsHS^ an d 64).   F*agree that so ma suchsystem,of control might be useful for checkingpractices in the meat trade which are againstthe public interest, and I have accordingly in-sorted,in the draft Combines Bill (G.T.8328) nowbe-fore the Cabinet a provision which empowers the Boardof Trade, where they have made an Order applyingSection 3 of the Bill to any combine, to prohibitany person from dealing by way of trade in any commodity affected by the operations of the combineunless holding a licence for the purpose from theard of Trade.Meat Department  -(page  5, paragraph 63 (a)   ).IS my opinioTTldie Meat Department which theCommittee recommend to be set up, would mosts ui ta bly be placed-under the Ministry of Fo*&amp;in the event of that Ministry being continued.The duty of investigating and dealing withCombines in the Meat Trade, as in other trades,ought however to remain with the Board ofTrade.    It is, I think, a sound prinoiple thatthese powers respecting combines
combines should be vested in a separate Department of theGovernment, arid not in a Department which actually dealswith or controls the commodities in question.gE^io^iU^Mau^ (page 28 ReceptionThe power to requisition&apos;insulated spa.ee on meat ships hasbeen of enormous importance to the country during the war,and some power of this kind ought to be available in peacetime so that it oould be used either to meet a food emergencyor to ward off an attack bv a Meat Trust.   The power shouldbe general in its. nature, for if it applies to meat shipsonly it will tend to drive those ships away to foreign flags,and it may be wanted for other kinds of food besides meat.Unless it is clear that the prerogative of the Grown includespower to requisition tonnage&apos;in time of peace, fresh legislatiwould be required. &apos;Since it is expected that the teeiioical termination of the ,war may take place before long, tne point is one of someurgency. &quot;It is one which will have to be dealt with before that date.Importation of Store OatlilliJr^ (pagesOn this question the Committee were divided.   I may, however,refer to the statement made by Lord Ernie at the meetingof the Imperial War Conference on 26th April,1917 asfollows:-MAs far as I personally am concerned, and so far asthe English Board of Agriculture is concerned, we shouldbe wise to remove the embargo&quot; - So far as the EnglishBoard of Agriculture is concerned we are in favour of theremoval of the embargo.  V/e do not believe that there is no?/or has been for many years past the slightest ground to exclude Canadian Cattle on the score of&quot;disease -mr; Walter Long expressed concurrence, and a motiiv*by Mr. Rogers on behalf of the Ounadian Government that the sembargo on Canadian Cattle be removed as speedily asEossicle was thereupon accepted.   Lord Ernie appears toave somewhat changed his attitude on the desirabilityof excluding Canadian Cattle, as appears from the reportof his reply to a deputation on 24th June,1919, but hethere adhered to&quot; the view that there were no cattle in &amp;eworld so free from disease as those born and bred in Canada.I strongly support the view expressed by Lord Ernloin 1917, and consider that the existing prohibition onthe importation of Store Cattle from Canada should be withdrawn.
3 OfCanada is part of the Empire and it is obviously very desirable therefore to allow Store Cattle to be broughtover unless there is any strong reason to&quot; the contrary,vAt the presont time there seems to be no serious risk of disease among Canadian Cattle and the reasons officiallyexpressed for excluding them have therefore no weight.Moreover, the present arrangement tends to put money intothe pockets of the American packers, which would accrue-,to British oar Canadian citizens if freedom to importwere allowed,(2)  In connection with the Report of the Committeeon Meat Supplies, I wish to call attention to a system whichis felt by Australia and New Zealand to inflict upon them aserious injustice.   I refer to the system under which various kinds of meat are sold by the Ministry of Pood at flat prices to tiie consumer the price of home produced and other meatwhich has been purchased at prices much higher than thosepaid for the Australian aid Sew Sealand meat.During 1918 and 1919 some 50.000 tons of australian and 83,000 tons of New Zealand mutton and lamb have beentransferred by the Board of Trade to the Ministry of Food&apos;,the- uniform price charged being lOd a lb.   The prices at which both mutton and lamb were during the same period sold bythe Ministry of tfood to the retailer have varied between10t and 1/3 a lb., including cost of delivery.  At thesame time Argentine mutton and lamb was purchased by theMinistry of Food at 11a lb,,c*i.f. from March,19l8    ito 30th June,1919. although it is inferior to the New Zealandqualities, while the prices paid for beef from North Americawhen owing to tonnage diversion it was for a time anaToiciableto buy there were/nuch higher than those paid for either)beef or mutton from Australasia or the Plate.A strong feeling exists in Australia and New Zealandthat they are being exploited for the benefit of British andforeign cattle raisers, and it is highly desirable that something should be done to mitigate it.   Ufcere would, Ithink, be much less resentment if the British consumer ofAustralasian mutton were to obtain the fall benefit (or evena substantial part of the benefit) of the low prices at whichthe meat is purchased by the British Government.(3)
Assuming1 that supplies of Australian and New Zealandmutton can be considerably increased, the reduction in price would have the effect of reducing the cost of living in this country by substituting a cheaper article of food for a more expensive article.As regards the action of the Board of Trade in thismatter, the following Tabular Statenant illustrates thecost oi Australian and New Zealand mutton and lamb to theBoard from 15th December, 1918 to October, 1919:-Australia New Zealand	Mutton	Lamb	Mutton	Lamb.	d per lb.	d per lb.	d per lb.	d per lb.Cost f.o.b.	5.125	6.125	5.375	6.500Freight	1.903	2.034	1.903	2.034Storage abroad	.500	.500,	.750	.750Marine &amp; War				Risk Insurance	.200	.220	. .220	-   .250Shrinkage	.050	.060	.053	.065Storage in United				Kingdom	1.000	1.000	1.000	1.000	8.798	9.939	9.301	10.599True Average Cost per lb.   8.995 9.957Sold to Ministry of food at lOd. per lb. less 2%commission to importinghouses. 9.800 y.bUUI may observe that taking into account the f,o,b. costof mutton and lamb (5d to 6MJ, the freight which lies.muttoncommisof 1918 beencommission to importing houses, have since the beginningn conducted without profit to the Board of Trade.the United Kingdom if the Ministry of Food could dispose of their meat more quickly.It is a matter for consideration whether  it is any longer necessary to control imported meat as there is littlelikehood of a shortage in the near future, and there is a prospect of a considerable increase upon existing supplies.Moreover the supplies of cheap imported meat will have amodifying effect as in pre-war times on the price of homegrown meat-
In this connexion I should like to draw attention,as a further example of this method of indirect subsidy,to the arrangement under vrMch the Government are atpresent makings a lai^e profit on British hides, andwhich is used, in effect, for the purpose of subsidiz-ing the orice of meat,   The Ministry of Pood fix theprice 01 and buy all home-produced meat.   The Ministryof Munitions (Supply) in agreement with the Ministryof Pood, fix the price of ^he hides.   The Butcher is allowed to reckon the value of the hides at lQf- to 8dper lb. according to quality.These hides, however, are at the present timesold to the tanner at 17  to 12^6. per lb according toquality.   This represents the world market price ofhides, the policy of the Leather Council being to sell the hides at the irorld price.   The  difference between these two prices gees to the ministry of munitions(Supply) in the first instance who hand it over to theMinistry of Food by whom it is used for the purpose of reducing or equalizing the price of meat.I should be glad to be authorized to proceed onthe lines recommended by the Committee in those oftheir recommendations wnich are of direct  interestto the Board of Trade, subject to my observations inparagraph (1) above.I further suggest that our present policy inregard to the price of meat and hides as described- in paragraphs (2) and (.3), above, should receiveserious consideration with a view to seeing whetherAustralian and New Zealand mutton and lamb should not now he sold in this country at the lowest possibleprice covering cost and expenses, and whether theexisting arrangement  under which a large profitappears to be made on home-produced hides is reallyessential to the system of meat control.A.c mm.27. 10. 19.
Confidential.  -INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON MEAT SUPPLIES.The Committee directed that the following statement embodying confidential information should be submitted to the President of the Board of Trade. Henry W.Macrosty, Secretary.Shipping Contracts with Meat Companip:s.When the Shipping Controller^ powers are exhausted shipowners will revert tothe full control of their steamers, subject only to their contractual obligations so far asthey may remain in force.In the Australasian trade there are only a few pre-war contracts. The great bulk -of the insulated shipping in the River Plate trade is covered by long-term pre-war con-tracts, running, in some cases for ten years. Excluding Vesteys&apos; Blue Star Line, whichserves only their own works, there are contracts running for the carriage of 554,000 tonsof meat from the River Plate to the United Kingdom, of which the American meatcompanies hold 72*2 per cent., the British meat companies 15*5 per cent., and^the Argen-tine company 12*3 per cent. The American companies have also contracts from Braziland Patagonia to the United Kingdom amounting to 44,000 tons a year, and they havecontracts from the Plate to the United States (not at present in operation) amounting toabout 156,000 tons a year. British meat companies operating in Patagonia have shippingcontracts for 4,000 tons a year. The capacity of the Blue Star boats, including those under repair and being built, is about 86,000 tons annually, and, including the Standardinsulated ships taken over by the Plate shipping companies, there is about 115,000 tonsmeat space not allotted, but out of this space for about 40,000 to 50,000 tons of meat ayear (not included in the British companies&apos; share of tonnage) is provided under Govern-ment control for the Las Palmas works. The total of the tonnage just discussed is959,000 tons, and as the tonnage available in 1921 is estimated to be 847,000 tons it follows that either a further allotment of space must be made to the meat companies or that they will be short of their contracted space by about 112,000 tons of meat.The rates of freight specified in the pre-war contracts are such as to preclude the profitable operation of the steamers under present conditions, and negotiations arenow proceeding between the Plate shipping companies and the meat companies for the variation of the contracts in this respect after Government control terminates. Manyships under pre-war contracts have been lost during the war, and it is stated by the ship-owners that they are under no obligation to replace them in the various services. Weunderstand that the contracts provide that if the lost steamers were replaced in the sameservices the meat companies shall have a prior call on the space and that the shipownersshall have a prior call on any chilled and frozen meat which the meat companies desire to ship. Under these conditions foreign tonnage cannot be brought in by the meat companieson services subject to the present contracts. The shipowners are, however, free to utilisetheir new tonnage for starting new services on contract with British or other meatcompanies, irrespective of the loss of steamers in existing services.24c7s

INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON MEATSUPPLIES,1. The terms of reference to us were :-&quot; To consider and report on the means of securing sufficient meat supplies for the United Kingdom at reasonable prices, with special regard to thedevelopment of meat production in the United Kingdom and in the BritishOversea Dominions, and to the protection of British markets and of producing countries within the Empire from domination by foreign organisations.&quot;Recommendations thereon will be found on pages 22 to 28.2. In pursuance of these instructions we have held 30 meetings and interviewed orreceived statements from 63 witnesses, including representatives of the Governments ofCanada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and Rhodesia, farmers (bothbreeders and feeders) in the United Kingdom, freezing works proprietors in the Dominionsand in South America, shipowners, cattle salesmen, importers, wholesalers, meat salesmen,retailers, and the English and Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Societies. statements were received from the American meat companies trading in the United Kingdom.Altogether, 19 witnesses furnished information regarding meat production in the UnitedKingdom, 17 regarding meat production in British Oversea Dominions, and 8 regardingmeat production in South America. Four dealt with shipping, one with land transport,and 11 with distribution in the United Kingdom. One witness gave evidence on thegeneral problems of meat control and we are indebted to the Board of Inland Revenue fora valuable memorandum on taxation, and to the Ministry of Food for a memorandum onthe Control of the Meat Supplies of the United Kingdom, 1917 to 1919. In our enquirieswe have dealt only with beef, veal, mutton, and lamb, and not with pork, bacon, and ham.3. We have also consulted the evidence given at previous enquiries the DepartmentalCommittee on Combinations in the Meat Trade (1909), Dominions Royal Commission(1913-16), the Royal Commission (Mr. Justice Street) on Meat Export Trade ofAustralia (1914), the New Zealand Meat Export Trade Committee (1917), the SouthAfrican Cost of Living Commission (1918), and United States Reports, especially theReport of the Federal Trade Commission on the Meat Packing Industry (1918), and theHearings before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House ofRepresentatives (1918-9).I.-THE PRESENT SITUATION.Demands for Meat.4. Taking the five agricultural years ended 4th June, 1914, the following table shows the average annual position of the United Kingdom as regards supplies of beef, veal,mutton, and lamb : -		Beef and Veal.

Although certain classes of the population have during the war accustomedthemselves to eat less meat, on the other hand much more numerous classes have found themselves able to purchase more meat than ever before. We do not think that thereis anj&apos; reason to anticipate a reduction in aggregate consumption of meat, and if pricesfall it may even increase. We are disposed to estimate the consumption of the UnitedKingdom at from 750,000 to 800,000 tons of imported beef and mutton annually inthe near future. Other countries have hitherto imported only relatively small quantitiesof refrigerated meat, but the depletion of the flocks and herds of the belligerentcountries and the increased habit of meat-eating fostered among the soldiers during thewar leads us to expect, for some years at least, an importation that will be limited only by the means of transport and the capacity of the importing countries to pay for the meat. We understand that the French Government desires to import for some years from 250,000 to 300,000 tons annually ; that Italy, if finance can be arranged, requires144,000 tons a year during the immediate future ; and that Belgium is prepared to takeabout 50,000 tons a year. What the effective demands of the other European Allies,of neutral countries, and of Germany and Austria may be we have no means of judging,but it is certain that all osrertlie Continent there is a scarcity of meat. In 1915 theUnited States imported 50,000 tons of meat from South America, but this developmentwas stopped by diversion of shipping. We expect that the American meatcompanies will speedily desire to resume their imports which in the near future may reach160,000 tons of meat a year from the River Plate. There will also be a seasonalimportation of meat from Australia and New Zealand, but in this shipping will be thedetermining factor. Altogether we may estimate the demand for chilled and frozen meatat from 1,350,000 to 1,450,000 tons annually.Supplies of Meat prom the Oversea Dominions.6.

Export from south Africa cannot take place on a substantial scale until shipping is provided and thequality of the cattle much improved ; the Union Government have now underconsideration proposals made by the Cost of Living Committee for the reorganisation ofthe meat trade and the prohibition of the export of beef as a means of reducing the very high prices prevalent within the Union. The prospects of the exportation of mutton fromthe Union are too uncertain to permit the suggestion of a figure.8. There are large numbers of cattle in Nigeria and East Africa, but at present onlysufficient for local supply, and progress in the direction of export must be slow in view ofthe necessity for protecting native land rights. Rhodesia is improving as a cattlecountry-the number of head having increased from 740,000 in 1914 to 1,200,000 in 1919,half of them being native cattle. The immediate market is the Transvaal, but the farmers are building a co-operative canning works and contemplate the erection of a freezingplant. The British South Africa Co. also have the building of a meat works underconsideration. The export of frozen meat is, however, not likely to begin for three orfour years, and then on a small scale.Supplies of Meat from Foreign Countries.9. South America is the great present source of meat supply. In the ArgentineRepublic there are about 29.000,000 cattle (the number having remained almost stationaryduring the war) and between 50,000,000 and 60,000,000 sheep; about 45 per cent, ofthe cattle are native. Uruguay has about 8,000,000 cattle and about 11,000,000 sheep.Chilian Patagonia has about 4,000,000 sheep. Brazil has an unknown number of cattle,usually estimated at about 30,000,0(10, but the great majority of them are not suitable forthe British market, though the meat, like that of Uruguay, is acceptable in Continentalmarkets. Venezuela has, during the war, exported frozen meat to France, and. Colombia,though at present undeveloped, offers the possibility of a trade of moderate dimensions.The American meat companies have also begun to develop Paraguay. Central america has a large number of wild and semi-wild cattle, but the possibilities of an export tradeare very uncertain for a long time. China (Yangtze Valley and Manchuria) has cattleof fair quality, and has done an export trade to France and Italy.&quot; Madagascar has alsoa freezing works, from which moderate quantities have been exported to France.10. The effective meat-exporting capacity of those foreign countries which need tobe taken into consideration at present is as follows, including output from works nowunder construction: The figures for Canada in 1918 were compiled on a different basis from those of previous years, and the increase may be partly due to better methods of investigation.&quot; Other Cattle &quot; in South Africa include a large number of draught oxen. Both inAustralia and South Africa the majority of the sheep are bred for wool rather than formutton. The importation of live fat cattle from Canada into the United Kingdom usedto be on a considerable scale, especially between 1903 and 1909 ; in 1901 it was 88,000head, but after reaching 191,000 head in 1903 it declined and had&apos; practically ceasedin 1912. Canadian export of frozen beef has grown up during the war ; as also has thatof South Africa, for it is only quite within recent years that the Union has becomeself-supporting.7. Judging from the experience of recent years we calculate that the surplusof meat available for export from the Oversea Dominions within the next few years willbe per annum :

It is not known on what service the United States steamers are or willbe engaged. The additions which, as far as we can ascertain, will be effective in 1921represent: British steamers ; Australasia, 6 steamers now repairing or reconditioningand 23 now building ; South America, 6 steamers now repairing or reconditioning and11 now building; French steamers, 13 now building ; United States steamers, 3 nowbuilding. Fruit steamers and steamers in the China trade are not included. There arealso a few steamers of small insulated capacity owned by neutral countries. No allowance has been made for losses or for steamers taken out of service.Summary of Supplies- and Demands.12. On the assumption that sufficient shipping were available the meat-capacity ofthe supplying countries in the immediate future would be about 1,400,000 tons a year,of which about 330,000 tons would be mutton. The requirements of the United kingdom for imported meat may be taken at 750,000 tons a year, those of France at 250,000 tons,,those of Italy at 150,000 tons, those of Belgium at 50,000 tons, and those of the UnitedStates at 160,000 tons or 1,360,000 tons a year in all. This total exceeds the presentcarrying ea,pacity of the world&apos;s insulated ships, even assuming a normal rate of- loadingand discharge, and though in a couple of years&apos; time there will apparently be a surplus ofshipping space for the supply of new demands, it cannot be realised to the full if the
present rate of handling ships is continued. The French, Belgian, and Italian requirementscannot be met in full to-day except with the assistance of British and American tonnage,and then no steamers will be left for the supply of other continental countries. On theother hand it is not unreasonable to expect that British shipowners will make a further effort to cope with the demands for insulated tonnage.13. The consumption of chilled beef at the expense of frozen beef was progressingrapidly before the war, and, unless and until chilled beef can be brought from the antipodes,Australasian frozen beef will be at a disadvantage in British markets compared withArgentine chilled beef. Beef from Brazil and Uruguay and mutton from the Argentine andPatagonia are best suited for continental markets, and the more highly priced australian and New Zealand mutton and lamb will tend to exclude foreign mutton and lamb fromthe markets of the United Kingdom. Meat will, in fact, tend to be distributed in thefuture as in the past according to its quality and price and the taste of the consumer.Before the war about one-third of the beef and veal consumed . in the United Kingdomcame from foreign countries and this proportion can mainly be reduced by an increase ofour home-grown supplies. On the other hand only 12 per cent, of the mutton and lambcame from outside the Empire, and the tendency is that this will diminish.Present Control of British Insulated Shipping.14, British steamers usually trading to South America, Australia, and New Zealandhave been, since the Spring of 1915, so far as regards the use of their insulated spaces ontheir homeward voyages, under the control of the Board of Trade and the ShippingController. The powers of the former Department were conferred by Orders in Councilof April 13th, April 29th, and October 14th, 1915, and chose of the Shipping Controllerby the Defence of the Realm Act. After the end of the war control will depend on the continuation of the powers of the Shipping Controller, and this is at present proposed tobe provided for under the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill. If that billbecomes law the Shipping Controller will have power to do all such acts as may benecessary effectively to control insulated ships for twelve months. The rates of freightand other conditions of the user of the ships have been agreed between the Board ofTrade and the shipowners for twelve months following March 1st, 1919, and are thensubject to revision. After the expiration of the powers of the Shipping Controller no control of shipping will exist unless meanwhile fresh legislation has been passed..15. When the Board of Trade assumed control of insulated shipping they requested the shipowners concerned to set up two Committees, the River Plate RefrigeratedTonnage Committee and the Australasian Refrigerated Tonnage Committee, and these committees, with sub-Committees in Buenos Aires, Sydney, and Wellington, operatedthe refrigerated tonnage under the general instructions of the Board of Trade, who didnot interfere with the details of ship management. After the Shipping Controller wasappointed a Joint Committee was set up informally, consisting of representatives of theMinistry of Shipping, Board of Trade, War Office, and (later) Ministry of Food, and ofthe Secretaries of the River Plate and Australasian Tonnage Committees. At the weeklymeetings of this Committee all questions relating to the movements of insulated ships have been discussed and recommendations were made to the Shipping Controller for his executive action so long as the system of Liner Requisition held. That system has nowbeen discontinued, but as the requisition of insulated space is still in force the Committeestill meets and will continue to do so as long as the present system of control endures.The United States Meat Companies.16. We were also commissioned to consider &quot; the protection of British markets andof producing countries within the Empire from domination by foreign organisations.&quot;Popular opinion regards the American meat companies Swift and Company, Armourand Company, Morris and Company, the T. Wilson Proprietary Company, and Cudahyand Company as forming a secret combination,-although openly they operate separately,and considerable apprehension is expressed both in the United Kingdom and in theDominions lest they should obtain a domination over all the sources of supply and the distributive markets. With their operations in the United States we are not directly concerned. The Federal Trade Commission on the Meat Packing Industry (1918) hasdenounced them as a combination working through a livestock pool and has accused them of sundry malpractices, resulting in their obtaining a command over most of the importanttowns in the United States The meat companies, on the other hand, assert that theyabandoned all pools and combinations a long time ago and now work in complete

During each period of &quot;conference&quot; or agree-ment the American companies retained a part of the trade they had taken away duringthe preceding period of intense competition, thus improving their position.In 1916 Armour and Company&apos;s new works at La Plata were opened and in 1918Morris and Company&apos;s new works at Monte Video ; on both occasions the associated com-panies agreed to n re-allotment of their shares in the Government contracts and in the private trade, the result being a reduction of the percentage to which the British companies were entitled. The British Government, in the stress of a great war, were not in a position to insist on the maintenance of the British percentage. Omitting for the moment theoutput from Vestey Brothers&apos; new works at Zarate (opened in 1916 and not in theConference) and the output from the Las Palmas works (operated since the autumn of independence. This independence, however, cannot date farther back than 1912, whenthe National Packing Company owned by Swift, Armour, and Morris was dissolved for fear of the anti-trnst laws. By that time the &quot; Big Five &quot; had attained so dominant ashare of the meat trade of the United States, that a simple tacit understanding to respecttheir relative positions to one another was&apos; sufficient to secure them all the advantages of an active combination, and they are now reaping the benefits of their former co-operation and of their great business ability and money-po&apos;wer. The Swift and Morris families arerelated by marriage ; the present head of the Wilson Company was previously withMorris&apos;s, and Cudahy was a former employee of Armour&apos;s. The Wilson Company is owned by banking houses in the chief of which Swift and Morris fire closely interested.Besides these friendly relationships it is obvious that, working on the narrow margins of profit winch they claim, they cannot afford to imperil their gigantic; turnover bycompetition. There may be a rivalry in efficiency between branch houses ; there is little doubt but that proportions of trade are respected. It is reported that the United StatesGovernment is now taking proceedings against the meat companies under the laws againstcombinations and &quot;unfair&quot; competition in domestic trade. The Webb Act of 1918,however, exempts from the provisions of these laws associations &quot; entered into for the sole purpose of engaging in export trade; and actually engaged solely in such exporttrade.&quot;17. Swift and Company entered the Plate in 1907 by purchase of the La Plata cold storage Company ; and in 1908 Swift, Armour, and Morris acquired the La Blancacompany ; in 1911 Swift dropped out from the latter company, leaving it to the other two. The American companies enlarged their works and soon entered on a campaign of aggressive competition. Up till November, 1911, there vras no agreement between themand the British and the Argentine companies, but after a price-war in that year an agree-ment was made which lasted till March, 1913. Morris and Company then complained oftheir share of the trade, and this dispute (generally regarded by the British trade asengineered) produced another fight characterised by the forcing up of cattle prices in theArgentine and the depressing of meat prices in England. After fifteen months&apos; fighting the British companies were forced to accept a serious reduction in their percentage of thetrade. The agreement then concluded governed the allocation of the Government contractswhen war broke out, and further modifications were made in 1916 and 1918 to admit ofthe participation of Armours new works at La Plata and Morris&apos;s new works at Monte-Video.   The following Table shows the movement from 19 )9 up to 1916
1915 on behalf of the Board of Trade), the effect of the re-allotment in favour of Armourand Morris was as follows : 	-	August, 1916, to May, 1918.	From . June, 1918.		British Companies     .........

The American companies have some 45 per cent, of the capacity of the freezingworks in Patagonia, about 75 per cent, of that of the works built or building in Brazil, andthey are developing Paraguay. Swift and Company own two meat works in Queensland,-with about one-fourth of the killing capacity of the State. Armour and Companyacquired a meat-exporting company in New Zealand and before the war bought largely inAustralia.   Swift and Armour own one-sixth of the.meat storage capacity of Canada.19. In 1913 the United States meat companies operating in South Americacontributed one-fifth of the total beef-supply of the United Kingdom, or about half of thetotal beef imported ; at Smithfield they controlled over 45 per cent, of the total Supply of beef and 57 per cent, of the imported supply. The four American companies and one british company, early in the war, had one hundred and forty-four wholesale depots in61 towns. In 17 towns the American companies had no competition in Plate beef, while in three the British company was unopposed. in 12 towns one American companycompeted with the British company, and in 29 towns two or more American companiescompeted (or could compete) with each other as well as with the British company.20. It is claimed that the combination of the meat companies extends only to the pooling of tonnage, and involves no further co-operation, but such pDoling is one of thebest-known forms of li Kartell,&quot; entailing important economic consequences. Rivalry inpurchase of cattle ceases to be necessary, and, as each of the companies in the &quot; conference &quot;has full knowledge of what meat is coming forward and what the others are doing, thereneed be no rivalry in selling. There is no longer so much need of the consultations to fix prices which were in existence for some time before the Departmental Committee onCombinations in the Meat Trade reported in 1909. All the possible competitors have thesame market knowledge, and the only factors outside their own control which they haveto take into account are the supply of home-killed beef, the relatively small imports ofAustralasian beef, and at times 1 he competition of mutton. British producers at homeand overseas have thus to face an unavowed ^but very effective combination in the beeftrade, and the fact that at least one of the American companies is a large purchaserof British cattle adds to the apprehension of the home producers that the control of imported beef may be used to depress the price of their meat, and thus ultimately to increasethe hold which the &quot; Trust&quot; has over the market.

The majority of cattle are now killed at about 2^ to 3 years,2i678 A 621. The competitive strength which the American meat companies derive from their money-power and their readiness to act in union when necessary is enhanced by theoperation of the Income Tax laws. Prior to 1915, owing to the state of the law, it was almost impossible to assess the profits of non-residents in the United Kingdom in anyother way than by reference to the results shown by accounts kept by branches or agents in this country. These results from a revenue point of view were uniformly unsatis-factory. In 1915 the law was altered and the Assessing Commissioners were empoweredto charge the non-resident on a percentage of the turnover of the business done by himthrough or with the resident agent in whose name the non-resident was chargeable. Thepercentage determined could be appealed against to a Board of Referees, whose decision was final. But by the Finance Act of 1918 non-residents were authorised to appeal to theAssessing Commissioners to have the assessment in respect of profits from goods orproduce manufactured or produced abroad restricted to the merchants&apos; profits. The net result is that the American meat companies are assessed for income tax and excess profitsduty only on their merchant profits made in the United Kingdom, while companiesresident in the United Kingdom and operating in the Dominions and foreign countries are taxed on their profits, whether as producers or merchants, and whether brought tothe United Kingdom or not.II.-THE FUTURE OF PRODUCTION.22. The only way of ensuring that the price of meat shall be reasonable is either to limit the demand or to take care that the supplies are abundant and not controlled by .rings or combinations. Supplies in turn will not be abundant unless prices are such aswill afford a reasonable remuneration to the producer. Bearing in mind that one important desideratum is that British markets are to be kept free from foreign domination,and that home producers are more easily dealt with than foreign producers, it is evidentthat we should look for increased and assured supplies in the first place to the UnitedKingdom, in the second to the Oversea Dominions, in the third to British companies operating in foreign countries, and only in the last place to foreign producers.Production in the United Kingdom.23. The total number of cattle and sheep kept in the United Kingdom is returnedeach year in June, and given in the Annual Agricultural Statistics, first issued in 1867.Taking quinquennial averages, the numbers during the past thirty years have been asfollows, in thousands : 
instead of between 3 and 4, and of sheep at lg- years instead of 2 years. Consequently,the numbers shown at the annual census now represent on the whole a greater meat-producing capacity than formerly. On the other hand, the average weight of both cattle and sheep when slaughtered is probably less, partly by reason of the earlier age, andpartly by the change in the public taste which demands leaner meat and smaller joints.To-day about 60 per cent, of the beef and veal and about 50 per cent, of the mutton and lamb consumed in the United Kingdom are produced at home, and normal slaughter forthe period just before the war was about 2,500,000 cattle, 800,000 calves, and 11,000,000sheep annually.24. The extension of meat production in the United Kingdom cannot be fully considered, except in relation to questions of agricultural policy and development whichare outside our reference. It is evident that, in the absence of interference by the State,farmers will devote their attention primarily to that product, whether corn, meat, ormilk, which promises to be most profitable. If the policy expressed in the Corn production act, whereby a minimum price for c am is guaranteed by the State, is continued and if noequivalent advantage is offered to those&apos; farmers who rely mainly on live stock for theirlivelihood, some incentive may be given to look to corn rather than to stock in the future.At the same time, as evidence brought before us shows, corn-growing and meat production are to a large extent supplementary and may be made more so than they are at present.25. One general recommendation made by all the agricultural witnesses was that thequality of the cattle should be improved, since in this way they would fatten more quickly and to a greater weight, so that the aggregate produce of meat would be increased withoutrunning any more cattle. It was urged that farmers should be prohibited from using anybulls that had not been certificated by a proper authority, but it was at the same timeadmitted that, while there would be no difficulty in getting the larger farmers to conform to such a regulation, there would be considerable trouble in persuading the smaller holdersto comply. We are impressed by the complaints as to the low quality of a largeproportion of our cattle and by the urgency for an improvement. We regard the matter as one for immediate action by the Boards of Agriculture and by the various agriculturalsocieties. Under the Live Stock Scheme of 1914 the Board of Agriculture and Fisherieshave now 728 subsidised pedigree bulls in England and Wales, and their officers reportthat there is no difficulty in selling calves got by &quot; premium bulls&apos;; at higher pricesthan ordinary calves fetch. The Board of Agriculture for Scotland estimate that some30,000 superior calves are produced each year from their premium bulls and that the improvedvalue has resulted in an annual gain of  30,000 at a cost of less than  5,000 a year.Farmers are also replenishing their stocks of breeding ewes from the superior flocks ofcrofter settlements where the Board&apos;s rams have been used ; formerly these flocks werethe most inferior in- Scotland. Under the Cattle Improvement Schemes of the IrishDepartment of Agriculture there are 1,200 specially selected pure bred bulls at service,and the improvement in the quality of stock compared with twenty years ago is enormous ;but a large proportion of the 30,000 bulls in Ireland are still of inferior quality.26. Another general measure, the adoption of which was strongly urged, was that greater attention should be given to preventable diseases. A reference to the heavy annual loss in Ireland from abortion in cattle is sufficient to indicate the necessity for taking% up such problems with vigour. Under the Live Stock Control Scheme the government took over the insurance against tuberculosis, and it has been suggested to us that this responsibility should be continued, since the country would gain from the financial pointof view much more than the cost of the Scheme.27. Ireland has been the great reservoir for store cattle for England and Scotland.Feeders have, therefore, been perturbed by the fact that, while the export of fat cattlefrom Ireland rose from 260,000 in 1910 to 456,000 in 1914, the export of store stock fellin the same period from 469,000 to 403,000. Some of the cattle exported as fat were, nodoubt, fed for a further two or three months on British farms but the Department ofAgriculture for Ireland report that &quot;the fattening pastures of Ireland can produce primebeef as economically as any part of Great Britain and with the growing use of basic slagand artificial feeding stuffs the area to be devoted to this purpose is likely to extend.&quot;In itself the fattening in Ireland of cattle now sent as stores to Great Britain wouldneither increase nor decrease the supply of meat. Whatever happens to the progress of cattle-fattening&apos; in Ireland the same number of stores will be needed in Great Britain as heretofore, and it is clear that the number of calves reared in Great Britain can be largely increased. The extension of fattening in Ireland, even by stall-feeding, is, however, subjectto limitations, for about half the holdings in Ireland are under fifteen acres and suitable
only for breeding. The average rateable value of the holdings in Ulster is  16, of thosein Munster  21, of those in Leinster  27, and those in Connaught  11. These figures show how small most of the farms in Ireland are and how impossible it would&apos;be to growenough feed on ,them to fatten cattle. From these farms, especially in the south, thecalves are passed &quot;on to larger farms, and the young beasts as they grow are frequentlysold through three or four hands (each with more extensive grazing), before they arefinished oft on the Midland pastures prior to exportation. If the steps which have beensuggested for the improvement of stock are taken and more calves and of better qualityare born, the occupants of larger and medium-sized holdings will be able to bring forwardmore young cattte.with the help of feeding-stuffs and so assist in maintaining the supplyof stores for Great Britain.28. The improvement of stock in Great Britain, especially if dairy farmers give more attention to &quot; dual purpose &quot; animals, will increase the number of calves suitable forrearing and fattening. . A greater number of stores than the 2,500,000 at present brought forward in Great Britain and Ireland might become available and thus there would be anopportunity of reducing the price of stores and increasing the supply of meat. Suchresults, however, will be greatly facilitated if breeders&apos; and feeders&apos; costs, are reduced;cheap fcbd depends on cheap production, that is, on a more abundant supply of cake andand millers&apos; offals at prices much below those now ruling. A great deal has been donein the way of investigating new feeding stuffs and keeping farmers advised of their relative feeding value in proportion to their price, and these investigations and publicationsshould be not only continued but extended. There are also other means, of increasingthe food supply for live-stock, such as the improvement of second-rate pastures by theapplication of artificial manures ; considerable results have already been obtained invarious districts in this way. Another is the growth of vetches, peas, and other foragecrops for summer feeding in the place of pasture. We were informed that this methodhas been successfully demonstrated in Scotland. The abandonment of the system of growing turnips and straw for cattle feeding in winter in favour of fattening them onarable crops in summer and on vetch hay, straw, and limited supplies of roots or onbeet refuse in winter, was advocated. The cultivation of sugar-beet, where it can begrown successfully, would increase the food supply for live-stock. More scientific feedingof young&apos; stock is also of importance; the average accession of weight is about a pounda day in ordinary practice, but experiments show that a daily addition of nearly apound and a-half is practicable. The high cost of producing meat is largely due tothe poor condition of many of the stores that come forward, and gain in the weightof stores by improved feeding is highly desirable.29. It was suggested to us that much land now given up to game could be usedmore profitably for cattle or sheep, particularly in the deer forests of Scotland. over ,500,000 acres are occupied as deer forests (about 600,000 acres being below the ] ,000feet contours), many of which formerly carried sheep. These forests could probablycarry one sheep to 10 acres, or an addition of 350,000, and one stirk or the equivalent,to every 20 acres below the 1,000 feet level, or say 30,000. On existing hill-sheep farmsmany cattle could be grazed, for the sheep do not use the valleys in the summer wherethe grass is rank and unpalatable to them but not to cattle. The hill-sheep flocks ofScotland are said to number 2,500,000 head, and probably 60,000 additional cattle couldbe grazed without displacing the sheep stocks. These cattle would, however, have tobe fed in the Lowlands in the winter. More sheep could also be maintained on theexisting farms if the land were drained, the heather burned, the bracken cut, and, in somecases, basic slag applied. Further, there would be a great saving if some of the mostwidespread and fatal diseases of hill sheep could be prevented. On the other hand, theprice of stock is so high that the cost of entry to a sheep farm is almost prohibitive,while heavy expenditure would have to be incurred on buildings, fences, drains, &amp;c, andon clearing away bracken, sedge, and weeds on derelict farms. The objection may beraised to the re-stocking of the deer forests that deer pay better than sheep, but it maybe possible to run cattle with the deer, and, in any case, increased production must take precedence over the interests of sport. The increased production of meat thus obtainedwould, however, only be a very small percentage of the country&apos;s requirements.30. The introduction of Government or co-operative slaughter-houses and the saleat such slaughter-houses of stock on a dead-meat basis were pressed on our attention.It was urged that there would thus be a saving in transport and less loss of weight.The evidence of practical experience might then convince the farmer of the wastefulnessof over-fattening, and encourage him to feed larger numbers of stock.   There is21678
already an active movement in the direction of. -the, creation of -farnier-s-&apos;rcq-operative societies for running slaughjter-houses. The Ministry of Food instituted a scheme of slaughter-houses for the sale;of cattle on .the dead-weight system, as an,.alternative to thegrading system, some of&apos;which, were managed by farmers&apos; societies as agents..for t heMinistry. Nineteen such societies have been working in this way since March,&apos; 10IS, andhandle 1,4.00 cattle and 6,750 sheep weekly. The results have&apos;&apos; been.very satisfactory,and the Agricultural Organisation Society, in order to facilitate extension of the system,is proposing to arrange for the distribution of all meat that cannot be sold locally.31. Anything that will stabilise the industry or reduce risks will tend to encourage the production of live stock. The following measures among others were urged on our attention :  (a) Sale of cattle by live Aveightto be compulsory, or, at any rate, weighing to becompulsory whether the sale be made by weight or not.(b) Licensing of dealers in live stock, with a view to preventing cases of irregulardealing or doubtful transactions.(c) The provision of better shipping services from Ireland to-Great Britain andon the west coast of Scotland.32. The only proposal placed before us affecting British agriculture that disclosedmuch difference of opinion was one for the repeal of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1896,so far as it prevented the importation of store, cattle from Canada. It was supported bymeat traders and by the representative of the Canadian Government. Farmers who buystores to fatten were in favour, but the breeders of stores, who include the small farmersboth in Great Britain and Ireland, and thus are the more numerous body, were strongly opposed. Most buyers of stores advocated the change in the law because they thoughtit would reduce the price of stores generally without affecting the number bred in-thiscountry, the breeders&apos; present margin of profit being, in their opinion, excessive ; if theexport of store cattle from Ireland continued to decline the opening of a fresh source ofsupply would be all the more important. Meat traders were in favour because they believed that with cheaper stores the price of meat could be reduced. The case for canada, as put by Mr. Arkell, Live Stock Commissioner for the Dominion, was breifly as follows : Canada proposes to proceed with all speed in the development of an exporttrade in chilled and frozen beef, and Mr. Arkell admitted that the fattening of her cattlefor export might well be ultimately more important than the export of stores, since thehides, offal, and other by-products, and the profits of butchering, would be retained in thecountry. At present, however, there is an annual surplus of about 200,000 cattle whichhitherto have been marketed in the United States. If this outlet were closed and no otherwere opened, the development of the cattle industry would be seriously hampered, for thestock markets would be glutted at certain seasons of the year, and farmers would becomestill more dependent on the packers. There was. he maintained, no fear of the introduction,of disease into the United Kingdom ; there had been no case of pleuro-pneumonia inCanada since 1886, and the veterinary control was so strict that there was no importationof disease into the Dominion even during the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease inthe United States in 1916, which lasted over a year and affected 23 States. Lastly, Canadaregards the prohibition of importation not only as casting an unwarranted slur on her stockbut as injurious both to her interests and to those of the United Kingdom. She is extremely anxious to develop a new market in the Empire for her surplus stores, andthinks that the renewed entry of Canadian store cattle into the United Kingdom will be ofadvantage to both countries concerned.33. The case, as put to us, against permitting the importation of Canadian storesrested mainly on the danger of the introduction of disease. During the last quarter ofthe 19th century there was active agitation arising out of the heavy losses incurredthrough the ravages of disease, and successive legislative measures were passed,culminating in the Act of 1896, which only permits the landing of cattle in the Unite IKingdom if they are immodiately slaughtered at the ports, and then only if the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries are satisfied that reasonable security is afforded against theimportation of animals affected with foot-and-mouth disease. Since that time the seriousdiseases of cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, and foot-and-mouth disease, which formerlyravaged the herds of this country, have been practically extirpated, and the remarkablestandard of healthiness which has been so long maintained is attributed by veterinarians,as well as by stock-owners, to the rigid exclusion of nil live animals from the country.Admitting that Canada has been for long free from disease, British and Irish breeders
are sceptical of the possibility of excluding all affected animals along the extensive landborder of the United States, and they fear least a concession to the Dominion might leadto pressure for importation from countries which are really suspect. It was stronglyrepresented to us that the removal of the &quot; embargo &quot; would give a severe shock to theconfidence of British and Irish stock breeders and that the moral effect would be to check the breeding of native stores. The result might well be that the aggregate number of stores available for fattening would not be increased and that their price would not bereduced. It was argued that the introduction of Canadian stores never played a great part in British farm economy, for their number prior to 1892 probably did not exceedmore than 50,000 or 60,000 a year at a time when the stores reared in the UnitedKingdom numbered about 2,000,C00 a year. To-day the number of stores reared at homeannually is about 2,500,000, and, it is urged, if proper measures are taken to improve the quality of stock and reduce the cost of feeding, the best means of increasing andcheapening the supply of meat lies in the conservation of our own herds.34. Looking at the problem from the point of view of the meat supply for theUnited Kingdom, it appears to us that its importance has been exaggerated. The fear ofBritish and Irish breeders that there is serious risk of the introduction of disease from canada is not justified by the evidence ; :it the same time it is open to doubt whetherthe result of importation would be a net increase of stores available for British feeders.At the present time, Canadian stores cannot be landed in this country at attractiveprices ; ocean freight rates ( 16 to  18 per head) are to-day prohibitive, and there is noapparent prospect of such a reduction in rates as would make export remunerative inthe near future.*Production in the Oveksea Dominions.35. During the war the exportable surplus of meat from Australia and New Zealandwas purchased by the Imperial Government, together with such cargoes of meat as couldfrom time to time be obtained from Canada and South Africa.   In the case of the lattertwo Dominions there were no running contracts as with the two former, and specialmeat-steamers had to be put in as there was no regular insulated service.    TheAustralasian meat was purchased for the duration of the war and for the three monthsthereafter, but at the request of the New Zealand Government the New Zealand contracthas been extended to include all meat that can be put into store up to the 30th June,1920, so as to tide over the period of liquidation of the accumulation of stocks broughtabout by the diversion of insulated steamers for the conveyance of American troops to europe.   It has been proposed that the contracts with the Governments of the AustralianStates and of the Dominion of New Zealand should be extended for a term of years(say five), long enough to cover the reconstruction period, so that producers might comesafely through a time when trading would be uncertain and be encouraged to expandtheir production pending the restoration of normal conditions, and that similar contracts should also be entered into with the Governments of the Dominion of Canada and of the[Jnion of South Africa.   Some of the witnesses who appeared before us even proposed thatall importation of meat should be conducted permanently under Government control.   Suchplans could only be carried into effect with the co-operation of the Dominion Governments,and so far not one of them has shown any desire to engage in such far-reaching operations,although any terms which might be agreed would guarantee an assured market and a reason-able profit to the producers and the freezing works.   The New Zealand Government is theonly one which has asked for any extension, and that a limited one, of the originalcontracts.   The Government of Queensland is understood to be willing to sell to theImperial Government surplus cattle from the Government Stations on favourable terms,but such a sale would, of course, represent only a very small part of the output of theState.   The Government of Victoria has cabled : &quot;Government here, having consultedall producing interests, consider that best method increasing meat production will beopen market immediately on termination of present contract with Imperial Government,three months date after termination of war, provided insulated space guaranteed equalwhat would be provided if contract extended for period of Imperial Government controlshipping.   Failing open market with full shipping facilities, Government consider thatany extended contract should provide prices in harmony with retail rate prevailingUnited Kingdom, and with prices being received America and other sources of supply.Broadly speaking, Victoria could greatly increase meat exports if prices enabledproducers to pay cost of cultivating fodder crops.&quot;   The Victorian Government is clearly* For recommendations on the subject of Canadian Stores, see pages 26 and 27.
apprehensive of diversion of ships, and only contemplates the desirability of renewing the contract for the New Zealand term. The importing houses in London, many of whompossess freezing works in Australia and New Zealand, are all opposed to the continuanceof Government purchase. The opinion was also expressed that the purchase of Dominionmeat while foreign companies were left free in their trading would be hurtful to imperial interests. In the absence of any evidence that the maintenance of these contracts wouldbe welcomed in the Dominions, Ave have not thought it advisable to proceed further withthe consideration of this plan. it may be observed that it is open to DominionGovernments or to co-operative associations of farmers (as was recently proposed in NewZealand) to organise combined exportation of meat to this country and so eliminatemiddlemen&apos;s profits.36. Although in the past the meat from Australia and New Zealand has practically all come to the United Kingdom, the Incorporated Society of Meat Importers, composedof firms trading with these countries, considers that there is some risk that with the greatdemand for meat in other parts of the world supplies might be diverted from the UnitedKingdom on the termination of the existing Government purchase scheme. They, accord-ingly, proposed to us that contracts should be entered. into with freezing works in theDominions, binding them to send to this country certain minimum proportions of their output (80 per cent, in the case of New Zealand, 75 per cent, from Australia, and 70 percent, from Canada and South Africa). In return for this guarantee they suggest that the -Imperial Government should offer a premium of a farthing a lb. on the total quantityshipped by British firms from Empire sources and consigned to members of an Associationof British Meat Importers, and a smaller premium to British traders operating in foreigncountries. This Association would be composed of British firms at present in the trade,or to be admitted in future on proof of their genuineness ; it would collect and distributethe premiums, but the members would carry on business independently, only co-ordinatingtheir distributing organisations so as to be able to meet American competition anywhere in the country. &quot; The scheme,&quot; they add, &quot;would involve the appointment of a respoii-sible Government official as director, to supervise the operation of the Association in its relations with the freezing companies, shipowners, and underwriters, and to protect theBritish public in respect of quality, price, and distribution.&quot; Foreign firms operating inthe Dominions were not to participate in the premium, but were to be guaranteed their share of shipping tonnage on entering into the proposed undertaking to ship to the UnitedKingdom. The Society maintained that the premiums (which would amount to  700,00&apos;.)on an importation of 300,000 tons) would be passed on to the producers in the same way in which seasonal changes in freight rates were passed on. This would lead the producersto increase their production considerably. At the same time, however, they said that &quot; itis quite reasonable to assume that the receipt of the premiums on guaranteed shipments to the United Kingdom would have a tendency to induce the beneficiaries to cut prices inthis market in competition with foreign traders, to the general advantage of consumers inthis market.&quot; They claim that British Dominion trade would thus be kept in Britishhands, and that the disadvantage under which the American meat companies would infuture work would be so great that they would gradually lose their domination of the imported meat trade.37. Critics of this scheme argued that the assumption that the premiums would accrue to the benefit of the producers was somewhat lightly made, considering that theywould pass through the hands of, first, the importing houses and, secondly, the freezingcompanies. They contended that each party in the train of transactions would naturallytry to increase their profits out of the Government fund, and it would only be after atime that the ultimate division would be settled. Meanwhile the British taxpayerwould feel that he was paying away money, in part at least, to increase the profits of traders and freezing works for no additional service.The Society hold out the prospect that the producers would ultimately cut prices in competition with foreign traders in order to find a market for their increased production,but it was pointed out that they would thus automatically deprive themselves of the benefitof the premium. In any case, we were reminded that the British producer at homewould object to be taxed in order to increase the competitive capacity of the producer inthe Dominions. We note that this scheme was rejected by the Producers&apos; Associations&apos;Central Council of New South Wales, embracing Graziers&apos;, stock owners&apos;, Farmers andSettlers&apos;, and Sheep-breeders&apos; Associations. Incidentally it was urged that the institution of the proposed Association of Meat Importers would&apos;be regarded as a new form of&quot; trust,&quot; with the power to keep up prices, and that, on the other hand, the appointmentof a Government director empowered inter alia &quot; to protect the British public in respect
of quality,price, and distribution &quot;would involve an interference with trade far beyond the mere &quot; supervision &quot; contemplated by the propounders of the scheme. Finally, as regardsa guarantee of shipping space both to Dominion and to foreign producers, which appearsto be an essential part of the Society of Meat Importers&apos; scheme, it was by no means clearhow such a guarantee could be given without far-reaching control of shipping.38. We are impressed by the way in which production in the Dominions has developed without any artificial stimulus.   The real problems are those of improving&apos;quality, extirpating disease, and providing against the risk of drought, and these canonly be dealt with locally, and not from the United Kingdom.As far as regards beef, the future lies with the chilled variety, and the prospect of bringing it from Australia and New -&quot;Zealand continues to be remote, but the possibilitiesof development of trade from Canada and South Africa were laid before us by witnesses.So far as Australia (except Queensland) and New Zealand are concerned, the futurelies with the production of mutton and lamb, and .the development in the recent past has- been continuous and vigorous. The demand in the United Kingdom is increasing andthe prospects of developing new markets in the United States and on the Continent ofEurope are bright. - The Imperial Government may usefully help by diplomatic action in securing the removal-of unjustifiable restrictions on importation and in obtaining for theDominions a fair share of the European and American trade.Meat from Australasia is brought to this country in ships carrying not meat only, butalso other produce for which the best market has hitherto been the United Kingdom.The possibilities of economically diverting such steamers (including the obtaining ofprofitable return cargoes) is limited, and the greater problem is more likely to be theobtaining of ships for the development of new markets for meat. These considerationsappear to. make it certain that a large proportion of Australasian meat will always come -to the United Kingdom ; but in any case, if the United Kingdom wishes to obtain its share of the world&apos;s meat supplies, it must be prepared to pay the world&apos;s price.Biiitish,.Meat Companies in Foreign Countkiks.     &apos;3&amp;. The -British companies operating in the Argentine are the British and ArgentineMeat Company, Ltd., at Campana, and the Smithfielcl and Argentine Meat Company, Ltd.,at Zarate ; the Las Palmas works of the former have been operated on behalf of the Boardof Trade since the autumn of 1915. The South American Export Syndicate, Ltd.,is a British company with works in Chilian Patagonia. Vestey Brothers, Ltd., Avhosecapital is British, but who are controlled by the brothers Vestey from abroad, haveworks in the Argentine, Brazil, Venezuela, and China; they have &quot;also been operating-works in Madagascar for the supply of meat to the French Government. The aggregatemonthly capacity of the British, (including Vesteys&apos;) works in South America may be put at from 40,000 to 45,000 tons a month. Considering that the Americans by their competitionforced the two British companies to pass their ordinary dividends in 1913 and 1914 andcompelled them to enter into a &quot; conference &quot; for the allocation of shipments, the witnessesheld that there was grave reason for fearing that, if the Imperial Government ceased to operate the Las Palmas works and withdrew from all control over meat supplies, theAmerican companies would again force a fight in order to increase their percentageof the trade. They thought this the more probable as the Americans would desireto make permanent provision for Morris &amp; Co,&apos;s Artigas Works at Monte Video, whichwere opened during the war.40. Two proposals for safeguarding the position of the British companies in thePlate have been put before us. . The first was that the Imperial Government shouldguarantee to all purely British companies a fair return on their capital. In return these companies would be required to terminate all their engagements with the other meatcompanies, and to place themselves fully under control of the Imperial Government.They would be bound to produce meat in the quantities specified, and to place it on themarket under specified conditions. The scheme proposed that, subject to a general supervision, the companies should be left liberty of action so long as the ordinary-dividend earned did not exceed a specified rate, the surplus above the guaranteed minimumbeing shared equally by the companies and the Government.41. The second plan was put forward by the Incorporated Society of Meat Importersas part of their premium scheme. They suggested that a premium of an eighth of a pennyper lb. should be paid to British meat companies operating in foreign countries, or halfthe rate to be paid to British firms operating in the Dominions. In return these companies.should guarantee to bring to the United Kingdom 70 per cent, of their outputif their&apos;works were in Patagonia, 60 per cent. if.their works were in the Plate, and
50 per cent, if their works were in Brazil. Foreign companies operating in foreigncountries could also enter into undertakings to bring to the United Kingdom the specifiedpercentages of their output, but would only receive in return an assurance that theirproportion of shipping space would be provided. This would have involved in 1913a payment of about.  140,000, and the amount would probably be greater now ; whatever the amount, it would be payable every year. The Society were of opinion that theadvantage to be given to the British companies would be a serious handicap to their foreign competitors.42. The two plans proceed on the same principle, that a financial advantage shouldbe given to the British companies. The difference between them is that a guaranteeinvolves the risk of a large payment in some years and may bring in some gains, whereas the premium scheme involves a substantial, but presumably smaller, payment every yearand has no counterbalancing share of profits. We have already given the argumentsbrought forward against the premium scheme for the Dominions, and an additionalargument against the adoption of either scheme relating to British firms in foreigncountries by itself is that it would unquestionably arouse much jealousy among Dominionproducers. British farmers would also feel aggrieved at privileges being given to traderivals at their expense. It may be answered that it is necessary to protect. Britishmarkets from the operations of foreign companies and that neither the United Kingdomnor the Dominions can supply in sufficient quantity the beef that is wanted, but it would .be difficult fq resist the claim that if monetary advantages are to be given to one sectionof producers they should be extended to all the producers who are engaged in the contestwith foreign meat companies.43. It has been proposed to us that legislation should be passed cancelling existing contracts between the meat and the shipping companies, and that the shipping companies should then be directed to let to purely British meat companies a definite proportion ofthe insulated space 50 per cent, was suggested on vessels trading between the Plateand the United Kingdom. The rate of freight would be left to private negotiation.The meat companies profiting thereby would undertake to break off all connexions withother meat companies, to ship the specified quantities of meat, and to take only the pre-war rate of profit. This plan would certainly be effective, but there are serious objections to it. In the first place, ex post facto legislation cancelling contracts anddepriving persons of rights which they had acquired under the existing law is a noveltyin British law-making. Though the United States Government may be hostile to thelarge meat packers in the United States, it must be remembered that under the WebbAct (1918) combinations solely for the purpose of export from the United States are legal,and a fortiori combinations for export from a neutral country. Again, British shipping has hitherto had a monopoly of the meat trade, but 15 American insulated steamers havebeen equipped during the war and at least three more are being built. All these steamerswill be looking for trade. Such drastic action as that proposed above might lead theAmerican meat companies, in self defence, to adopt the policy of providing their ownships, especially for the trade between the Plate and the United States, and thus depriveBritish shipowners of business which not only has been lucrative to themselves but hasbeen advantageous to the nation.44. As has already been stated, the Board of Trade arranged with the British andArgentine Meat Company, Limited, in August, 1915, for the re-opening of their works at Las Palmas, in the Argentine, which had been closed for the preceding two years.These works have since been operated by the company on behalf of the Board on profit-sharing terms, no remuneration (except a very moderate rent) being payable unless profitwas earned. The meat produced has been used by the Allied Forces, and the enterprisehas been very successful. The present contract runs ,for six months following thetermination of the war. Several witnesses have represented to us that the advantage tothe Imperial Government of having accurate and first-hand information as to the cost of producing refrigerated meat is so great that the arrangement, or some similar one, shouldbe continued.45. It appears probable that, within a relatively short space of time, Brazil maychallenge the supremacy of the Plate in beef. At first Brazilian meat would be more suitable for Continental markets, but this would relieve the strain on Plate supplies andtend to keep down prices. Shipping is at present deficient, but would be forthcoming ifthere were a prospect of establishing a good trade. Swift and Company have works atRio Grande do Sul, the Wilson Company has works at Ozasco, and Armour and company are building at S. Paulo.   Brazilian companies are established at Santos, Barretos and
Rio de Janeiro, and Vestey Brothers have works at Rio de Janeiro. It was represented to us as of urgent importance that purely British Meat Companies should also have ashare in the development of this great cattle country. During the war a proposal wasunder consideration to advance from the British Government one-third of the capitalnecessary, but although this was favourably regarded in time of war, we doubt whetherit is now possible to advance money for this particular purpose to an individual firm.We would point out, however, that the British Trade Corporation was incorporated by royal Charter for the purpose of supporting sound commercial schemes promoted byBritish enterprise.   (See Cd. 8567.)III.-DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.46. We also directed some enquiries into the organisation of the distribution of meatin order to ascertain whether any economies were possible there. Apart from butcherswho buy from local farmers or in the market, British-grown meat passes mainly throughthe hands of either commission agents or carcase butchers. The former sell meatconsigned to them by butchers in the country who buy cattle, slaughter them, and railthe meat to London or other large towns. The latter buy fat cattle in the country and-rail them to London or other large towns where they are slaughtered or they buy them at the town cattle market. Large retailers buy direct from the commission agent orcarcase butcher, but smaller retailers buy from a wholesaler who is the intermediary between them and the commission or carcase man. Complaints were made that beforethe adoption of control unnecessary costs used to be incurred by fat cattle being passedfrom one market to another through the hands of several dealers before they were finallyslaughtered, either the farmer or the consumer or both being the loser. Similar com-plaints were made of speculation leading to meat being bought and sold by severalwholesalers before finally passing to the retailer. It is in fact admitted that in a briskmarket there is speculation, but it is claimed that this means a spreading of risks.While all operators in the market do speculate on occasion there does not appear to bea class of intermediaries living solely by speculation; even, cattle dealers frequentlyperform a useful function by moving surplus stock to points where their knowledge of markets tells them a shortage is likely to exist, ft was suggested that all sales betweendealers and between wholesalers should be forbidden, but it would be very difficult.todraw the line. One distributor may quite legitimately &quot; oblige &apos; another with a class of meat of which the latter is short, and there are other transactions of an innocuouscharacter. The offence would also be difficult to detect/ Retailers, if they feel a grievance, have the remedy in their own tin ucls ; they can eliminate the middleman byco-operative buying. On this matter we took evidence from representatives of theEnglish and Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Societies and they maintained that theirsystem of common buying on behalf of the retail societies abolished middlemen&apos;s profits and reduced costs of transport. The same advantages can accrue to the producers as isshown in the experience of farmers&apos; societies.47. Meat from the Dominions is either imported into this country by firms who have their own buyers or their own freezing works overseas, or is sent on consignmentby freezing&apos;works or occasionally by farmers.   Meat from South America is imported by(a) companies owning freezing works and controlled from the United Kingdom,i.e. the British companies,(b) companies registered in the United Kingdom but controlled from abroadby companies also owning freezing companies registered in South America,i.e. the American companies and Vestey Brothers,(c) branch houses of companies registered in the Argentine (La Blanca andSansinena), and(d) British agents of Chilian companies.Australasian importers sell their meat to large retailers or to wholesalers (ex store or exship or c.i.f, to arrive), and the wholesalers re-sell to the retailers. Objection was taken-by several witnesses to speculative purchases by wholesalers of c.i.f. cargoes and to re-saleamong wholesalers ; such transactions, however, in many cases form an insurance to theoriginal importer, and the existence of the class of wholesale distributors renders it un-necessary for him to create a wide-spread organisation to keep in close touch- with theretailers. For distribution in the country the Australasian houses usually deal with localwholesalers. The Plate meat companies have their own stalls at Smithfield and their owndepots or agents in the provinces, and do their own wholesaling. There is much controversyas to whether this method is superior to and cheaper than that adopted by the Australasian
houses, but, on the whole, there does not appear to be much to choose between them. the differences in method seem to be mainly due to the fact that the Plate companies deallargely in chilled meat which requires a speedy sale, while the Australasian houses deal infrozen meat for which a longer period for sale is permissible. The Australasian importersare considering the &quot; co-ordination &quot; of their several distributing organisations so asto have a complete system of distribution over the whole country, enabling them to meetthe American meat companies at every point. Such a plan, however, strengthening thesellers against the buyers, may not be&apos; welcome to the retailers. The Co-operative wholesale Societies are planning to cut out all intermediaries and buy direct in Australiaand New Zealand.48. In the course of our investigations we had brought under our notice the GlasgowFleshers&apos; Association. This body-of wholesale and retail butchers was formed about 17or 18 years ago to combat the co-operative movement, any butcher who supplied meat to a co-operative society being excluded from dealings, either of purchase or sale, withany butcher in the Association. We do not know whether similar associations with asimilar policy exist elsewhere, but we consider that such a combination is detrimental tothe public interest, in our opinion an attempt to boycott or membership of a boycottingassociation should be a ground for withdrawal of licence, if the licensing systemrecommended by us is adopted (see par. 63).49. We found a wide difference of opinion as to the maintenance of government control over the meat trade, ranging from those who wished an immediate and absolutereturn to free trading to those who wanted the present Ministry of Food system to bemaintained. Some wished only imported meat to be controlled, others would controlhome-grown meat as well, while others again would control only meat imported byforeigners. An important section objected to &quot; control &quot; but were prepared to welcome&quot; supervision.&quot; The two proposals which found most support were (a) a system of licences to exclude foreign firms from the retail trade altogether and from the wholesaletrade in British and Dominion meat (see par. 54), and (b) to make it a condition of awholesalers licence that he should only resell meat to retailers (see par. 46). These wedeal with elsewhere. Beyond this there was a general uneasiness as to the future courseof prices and a fear of the possible action of the American meat companies, but no sectionof the trade had worked out any complete scheme for its internal re-organisation. perhaps a partial exception should be made with regard to the licensing proposals, but even hereviews differed as to whether we should expect a continuous: or an infrequent intervention by the Licensing Board to regulate supplies. Only the representatives of the co-operative movement were confident about their position for they were able to go direct to the producers and eliminate all middlemen&apos;s profits, to the gain of the consumer.50. Opinions also differed as to the desirability and feasibility of marking or labellingmeat&quot; home grown &quot; and &quot; imported.&quot; Some witnesses regarded it as impossible on accountof the amount of work required, except in large shops where a separate counter could be devoted to the imported meat, but one witness was in favour of marking all cuts andpieces, even those being sent out for house-to-house delivery. There was general agree-ment that it would not be practicable to insist on distinction being made in the shopbetween meat imported from the Oversea Dominions and that imported from foreign countries. Most of the witnesses also concurred in the opinion that only an expert could distinguish the better qualities of imported meat (when defrosted) fromBritish meat or assign at sight the country of origin to the various kinds of frozen meatexcept, perhaps, in the superior qualities; and the more the meat was cut up the moredifficult would it be to make distinctions. In proposals put before us for schemes of licensing of meat traders it was suggested that a retailer should be bound, as one of theconditions of his licence, to sell meat only under its proper designation. We are in sympathy with the principle underlying the proposal, but there are considerable practicaldifficulties in the way of its enforcement.51. In connexion with the distribution of meat in the United Kingdom our attention has been drawn to the damage to meat which occurs in its transit by rail way-wagon, van,or barge from slaughterhouse or ship to market. Railway companies provide insulatedcars with ice-boxes, and the consignors of meat who hire them have to pre-cool or icethem before loading or on the journey as they think fit. In warm-weather cars leftstanding in sidings become hot so that, instead of the insulation keeping the cargo cool asintended, the cargo absorbs the heat and becomes soft. The same is true for insulatedvans for road transport, and also for insulated barges which are often left lying in summertime for days in the docks or canals before they are wanted. It was urged on us that itshould be made compulsory on railway companies and on the owners of vans and barges
to pre-cool them before loading and to be responsible as steamship companies are for theproper carriage of produce. The Food Investigation Board of the Department of Scien-scientific and Industrial Research are now engaged in the study of the problems of refrigerationand of the transport of refrigerated produce.IT.-GENERAL ANTI-TRUST MEASURES.52. The witnesses who put before us proposals for the guaranteeing of meat supplies for the United Kingdom and for increasing the shares of the meat trade possessed by theBritish Dominions and by British Companies in foreign countries, had as one of theirobjects the limitation of the activity of the American meat companies, but in additionother suggestions were placed before us aiming directly at advantages now possessed bythe American companies or deliberately intended to reduce their share of British trade.53. It was maintained that the great wealth of the American meat companies wouldenable them to sell their meat for a period at or below cost and that thus they would be ina position to dominate the trade after they had squeezed out their British competitors. Asa remedy it was proposed that when such dumping was proved the Government shouldhave power to buy up the foreign-owned meat at current market prices and resell it through British firms at proper prices. It was pointed out on the other hand, that thedumped meat need not be sold actually below cost and that as. in 1913-14 it may be the excessive quantity put on the market that depresses the price. If the meat dumped werechilled beef, it would be impossible to keep it off the market for a prolonged periodwithout freezing it and causing loss of value, or, since it is in excess, to resell it at a&quot;proper &quot; price. Moreover, selling at a low price or even below cost is a quite defensibleprocedure in given circumstances, and the proof of concerted action would be difficult toobtain. To obviate these objections it was suggested that dumping should be prevented by only allowing foreign-owned meat to be imported in certain specified quantities,sufficient for the needs of the people, but not large enough to damage Empire-grownmeat by excessive shjnments. This scheme would impose on some GovernmentDepartment the task of continuously forecasting home supplies, of estimating the chanceof short supplies (say from drought) in the Dominions, and of calculating the balance tobe admitted from foreign countries and the share of each. We do not regard thisproposition as practicable.54. The Incorporated Society of Meat Importers and the . London and CountiesWholesale Meat Supply Association placed before us a scheme for controlling the meattrade by a system of licences issued under specified conditions. The scheme provided for six separate licences: 1. To import meat from the British Dominions.2. To import meat from foreign countries.3. To sell British or Empire meat by wholesale.4. To sell foreign meat only by wholesale.5. To sell British, Empire, and foreign meat by wholesale.6. To sell meat by retail.Foreign firms were not to be allowed licences to import meat from the Dominions orto sell such meat by wholesale or to tell any meat by retail ; they would be confined tothe business of the importation and the wholesale sale of foreign meat. Licences to importwere to be submitted to the Incorporated Society of Meat Importers, wholesale licences tothe Wholesale Meat Federation, and retail licences to the Union of Retail Traders fortheir advice. It was to be a condition of the import licence that the holder should declarehis monthly shipments in advance, and should alter them as required by the licensing authority ; this wTas intended to prevent dumping. The licensing authority should include representatives of the various trade interests concerned: The leading feature of thisparticular proposal is the restriction of one body of foreign traders to a particular classof trade, and we doubt whether such a sweeping restriction is to-day possible. We do notthink that.the scheme put before us can be adopted as it stands, but the suggestionhas been helpful to us in framing a licensing proposal of our own of a somewhat different character.55. A precedent for licensing is to be found in a recent Act* of the New Zealandlegislature requiring all meat exporters to be licensed, and empowering the Governmentto refuse a licence on grounds of public policy, and we are informed that under that Act* See Appendix, pages 29 and 30.
an export licence has been refused to Armour &amp; Co., Two Hills are at present before theUnited States Senate, known as the Kenyon Bill and the Kendrick Bill, which provideamong other matters for the licensing of persons engaged in the businesses of slaughteringlive stock, preparing or marketing live stock products, and marketing dairy products,poultry and poultry products ; they differ in some details, but agree in declaring licensesforfeitable on proof of unfair trading or combination to control prices, etc.V.-CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.56. The evidence laid before us shows, in our opinion, that, apart from the exigencies arising out of war conditions, there is little risk of a shortage of the quantityof imported meat required to supplement our home production. So far, indeed, asmutton and lamb are concerned we are satisfied that the Empire can become self-supporting within a few years, but the case is different with beef, as this country mustfor a considerable time be dependent on South America for the bulk of its imports. Inview of the strong position held by American companies in the South American meattrade the witnesses, with few exceptions, were agreed that some action was desirable and necessary to safeguard the interests of British producers and traders at home and abroad,and by so doing to protect consumers from the menace of a monopoly, but there was no general agreement amongst them as to the best measures to be taken in order to secure this end.57. We believe that the stimulation of supplies from within the Empire and theprotection of British interests outside the Empire form the best basis for ensuringsufficient supplies for the United Kingdom and we are strongly of opinion that thisshould be accepted as the permanent Government policy. The specific measures thatmay from time to time be required can be determined when occasion arises, but the publicadoption of this policy will yive confidence and encouragement to British producers athome, in the Dominions, and in foreign countries.*Production in the United Kingdom.58. We now proceed to deal in the terms of our reference with the measures to beadopted for increasing the total quantity of home-killed meat. We have taken it for granted that nothing in the nature of a tariff protecting home-grown meat is at presentin contemplation, and we have accordingly abstained from calling or examining witnesseson this subject. Such an enquiry, if undertaken, should be referred to another Committeespecially appointed for that purpose. We have also to point out that, in the main, we aresupporting the policy which the Departments of Agriculture are pursuing :  *(a) We are impressed with the complaints made of the poor quality of much of ourstock, and recommend that the measures already adopted by the agricultural departments for the improvement of live stock should be fully developed.In particular, active steps should be taken by the Departments and by Agri-cultural Societies to provide bulls and rams of good quality within easy access,so that no farmer can have any excuse for having recourse to inferior animals.It is desirable to prohibit the use of all bulls except those certificated as fit for breeding and, so far as this is now practicable, the necessary measures should be taken at once. It is important that dairy farmers should heconvinced of the necessity of breeding good &quot; dual-purpose &quot; animals ; in thisway the number of calves suitable for rearing would be increased.(b) We regard the prevention of the introduction of contagious diseases amonglive stock as of the highest importance, and in particular we recommendthat more vigorous action should be taken to reduce the annual loss fromtuberculosis and contagious abortion. We also recommend that further enquiry should be made into the feasibility of a compulsory scheme ofnational insurance against tuberculosis, either with or without State help.(c) We recommend that all possible steps should be taken to increase the supplyof feeding stuffs, to enquire into the methods of feeding which give thebest results, and to spread among farmers knowledge as to alternative methods of feeding. The greater use of forage crops, more scientificfeeding, and the improvement of poor pastures by the use of artificialmanures are points which will repay attention.(d) We recommend that as far as it is economically possible deer forests shouldbe utilised for summer pasturing of cattle and sheep.
(e) We recommend that the provision of slaughter-houses and auction marts and sale yards under the direct control of farmers should be encouraged, andwe approve of the efforts which are being made in this direction by theAgricultural Organisation Society. We regard the sale of stock by deadweight at co-operative slaughter-houses as the most satisfactory to the farmer and as at the same time serving the interests of the consumer.(/) We have no doubt that where cattle are not sold by dead weight the basisof sale by live weight should be adopted, primarily in the interests of theseller, but also as tending to more business-like methods of dealinggenerally. We are not prepared to suggest the compulsory enforcement of this method, but we recommend that in every market or saleyard allcattle (whether tat or store) exposed for sale should be weighed and the weights posted or notified before sale in such manner as to be readily available to all persons concerned.((/) We are of opinion that loss of meat would be avoided if a higher standardof sanitation were required for markets, slaughter-houses, and shops, andif better provision were made for the transport of meat by railway, road,river, or canal in properly insulated and cooled wagons, vans, and barges.(/i) We have given very careful consideration to the question of the importationof store cattle from Canada, a matter on which the opinions of the witnesseswere seriously divided, and we regret that we are unable to make a unanimous recommendation. Separate recommendations will be found on pages 26-27.Production in the Oversea Dominions.59. We regard the control or supervision of meat production in the Dominions as amatter for them alone, but in order to ensure unity of action by the several Governmentswe advise that there should be frequent inter-communication on this subject by conference or otherwise. As an example of action in regard to which general consideration mightbe desirable, we would refer to the recent New Zealand Act* for the licensing of meatexporters.Meat production in the Dominions may be expected to continue to progress rapidly,and the existence of a ready market in the United Kingdom for the bulk of their exportsis the best guarantee of such development. Some further aid can, however, be given byassisting them to secure new markets.\a) We recommend that diplomatic action be taken to obtain the removal of allunjustifiable restrictions on the importation of Dominion meat into foreigncountries, including the surlaxe ( entrepot on meat transhipped from theUnited Kingdom.   Further, if any action is to be taken for the feeding ofthe countries ravaged by the war, we consider that every effort should bemade to secure a share of the trade for the Dominions.(b) We,also recommend that Government contracts for meat should be confined to British producers in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions.We have already referred to a proposal to stimulate production in the Dominions by offering a subsidy in the form of &quot; premiums &quot; to British shippers of meat from theDominions to the United Kingdom, and have indicated that it would certainly give rise toa demand from home producers for similar treatment.   It also impinges upon general questions of fiscal and agricultural policy which cannot be usefully discussed in regard toone article of food alone.   We, accordingly, are not prepared to recommend the adoptionof this plan, but we think that when the question of tariffs, bountiesrand subsidies is beingconsidered in connexion with general trade policy it should not be left out of account.British Mkat Companies in South America.60. The observations made in the preceding paragraph with regard to premiumsapply equally to certain plans of subsidy or monetary guarantee to British companies inSouth America which were put before us.(a) We recommend that the Government should encourage friendly co-operationbetween British shipowners and British meat companies for theestablishment of services in which British interests would be concerned.Such co-operation would be promoted by means of the ConsultativeCommittees suggested in paragraphs (61) and (63(c)).* See Appendix, pages 29 and 30.
(b) We also recommend that the British Government should acquire an interest inone or more freezing works for the purpose of ensuring, by first-handacquaintance with the facts, that the position of British firms engaged inexportation of meat from these countries is not unduly prejudiced. Theco-operation of His Majesty&apos;s Government during the war in theLas Palmas works has proved to be of great value and affords an examplewhich might be followed with such modifications as circumstances require.If this proposal is adopted the practicability of opening such works to all british subjects deserves favourable consideration. We regard this proposal as in the nature of an insurance, necessary so long as the UnitedKingdom is compelled to draw a portion of its meat supplies from sourcesoutside the Empire.(c) We recommend that any profits accruing to the Government from its interestin such works should be applied to the encouragement of meat productionin the United Kingdom and in the British Oversea Dominions.Shipping.61. We are of opinion that the Plate and Australasian Refrigerated TonnageCommittees rendered very useful services during the war and we recommend that an organisation of this character should be continued for purposes of consultation between the Government and the- shipowners on such subjects as freights, services,distribution of tonnage, and foreign competition.   [See Paragraph 63 (c)).If this were done we anticipate that shipowners would be prepared to undertake thatthey would not vary their contracts to bring meat to the United Kingdom without firsttaking the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter. In this way the loss ofsupplies to the United Kingdom by the diversion of shipping could be prevented.Taxation.1 62. We have been greatly impressed by the evidence tendered to us that the presentsystem under which companies resident in the United Kingdom and operating in theDominions and foreign countries are taxed on their profits, whether as producers ormerchants, and whether brought to the United Kingdom or net, while foreign companiesnot resident in the United Kingdom pay only on their merchants&apos; profits in the UnitedKingdom, is a severe handicap on the former. This disability is one which is not confined to meat companies, and must clearly be considered with reference to the general problem of taxation of incomes in the United Kingdom. We are convinced, however,that British meat companies are very seriously prejudiced, and we recommend that ourexpression of opinion as to this grievance should be forthwith brought to the notice ofthe Royal Commission now investigating the income tax.Control of the Meat Trade.63. Various schemes have been put before us aiming at the exercise of a certainamount of control and supervision of the meat trade, so as to provide a ready means of intervention to, check practices detrimental to the public interest. After carefulconsideration of those schemes we make the following recommendations : (a) Statutory Licences. All persons who import1 or deal in cattle, sheep, beef,veal, mutton, or lamb in the ordinary course of their trade should berequired by statute to hold a licence from the proper authority as defined,,below (sub-section (c)). Farmers dealing in stock in the ordinary course of farming operations should be exempted from the necessity of obtaining a licence.(b) Conditions of Licences. Ah applicant for a licence should be required to&apos; furnish such information relating to the ownership of his business andother matters as may be prescribed.   Subject to the prescribed informationbeing duly furnished, the licence should be issued to the applicant as of:- course, except where it appears that a case for revocation of the licencewould immediately arise on its issue.The conditions to be attached to licences&apos; should be fixed by the licensing Authority, and in the case of importers might include a limitation of the quantities of meat to be imported within specified periods.In general, these conditions should require : 
All licensees to furnish at all times such information concerning theoperations of their business as may be required and to give reasonablefacilities for the examination of books and other documents relating totheir business.All licensees, who are importers, to furnish in the required detailperiodical returns as to their past and expected receipts of meat,(c) Meat Department. The Board of Trade or such other Department as theGovernment may select should set up a Meat Department assisted by twoConsultative Committees : --(a) consisting of representatives of theBritish interests in the meat trade, including producers and consumers, and(b) consisting of representatives of the owners of British insulated ships(see paragraph 61). The duties of the Department should comprise theissue, suspension, and cancellation of licences, subject to an appeal to a courtof law; the consideration of alleged cases of unfair trading and othercomplaints ; the supervision of works leased by the Government; and anyother duties that may from time to time be assigned to it.The Meat Department should be empowered to exempt certain classesof traders (in particular small butchers and hawkers) from the necessity ofobtaining or holding a licence and should discriminate between differentclasses in the information to be required and the conditions to be attachedto licences.64. We are of opinion that the adoption of the system of licences as above describedwill provide a method of checking practices in the meat trade, whether by trusts or other-wise, which are inimical to the public interest, but we consider that effective measures fordealing with trusts or combinations require legislation of a general character and maynecessitate international co-operation. The operations of trusts are not confined to the meat trade and there are in other trades combinations and corporations which have acquireda very considerable control over supplies. Any such anti-trust legislation may be expectedto define and proscribe trading practices detrimental to the public interest.General.65. Our recommendations are based on the assumption that normal conditions, oftrade will have been restored, and are not intended to apply to the exceptional period ofcontrol necessitated by the war. So long as this control continues (and it will presumably continue so long as there is any danger of meat being in short supply)international action may be required to secure fair treatment to the several meat-importing countries and to enable them to obtain supplies at a just price. This is a matter falling to be considered by the International Economic Council or any body replacing it.66. We desire to express our warm appreciation of the assistance afforded to theCommittee by the Secretary, Mr. Macrosty, who placed at our disposal a mass of valuableinformation collected by him and materially aided our investigations by his own experience in the subject and his untiring industry.WILLIAM C.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPORTATION OF STORE CATTLEFROM CANADA.I.At.the Imperial War Conference, 1917, the President of the Board of Agriculture andfisheries (Lord Ernie) assured the Canadian representatives that the English Board ofAgriculture were in favour of the &quot;removal of the embargo on Canadian store cattle. Hebased this view on the admitted fact that there was not, and had not been for a good many years past, the slightest ground to exclude Canadian cattle on the score of diseasedFurther, while he appears to have somewhat changed his attitude as to the desirability of excluding Canadian store cattle, nevertheless he admitted, in reply to a deputation in thepresent summer, that there were no cattle in the world so free from disease as those born andbred in Canada. These official assurances,taken with the evidence submitted to us render it difficult to accept the main argument advanced in support of the present restrictions,viz., that the confidence of stock breeders in the United Kingdom would be so seriously affected by the removal of existing safeguards against the importation of cattle from canada that there would be a decline in the number of home-bred stores.It is sometimes contended that the existing restrictions, whilst not justifiable inregard to Canadian cattle, are nevertheless necessary owing to the possibility thatdisease may be introduced into the United Kingdom through cattle which have reachedCanadian ports from the United States.The Canadian Live Stock Commissioner met this argument by pointing out that canada is protected against the importation of diseases of animals by a rigid system, of inspection and quarantine. He told us that, owing to the precautions taken, not asingle case of foot and mouth disease occurred in Canada during the last three outbreaks(one very severe) in the United States. He added that, if any additional motive were required to ensure the continuance of this rigid supervision in Canada, the opening up ofthe Live Cattle Trade with Great Britain would clearly supply it.It is further contended that the admission of Canadian store cattle would resultin a reduction in the price of stores and so discourage breeding, and that therefore thetotal supply of beef to the United Kingdom might not be appreciably affected. This con-tention cannot, we think, be accepted since the number of calves and stores reared depends on the quantity of food available in the United Kingdom, irrespective of what may bethe origin of the animals. In addition there is the admitted fact that the number ofstore cattle reaching England and Scotland from Ireland has recently been declining.We do not attach importance to the argument that under present conditions of prices and ocean freights cattle from Canada will not in fact be sent to the United Kingdom.This condition of affairs may well be temporary: in any case it seems to us to be irrelevantto the main question whether it is desirable or not to render the importation of storecattle from Canada possible.Finally, we consider that the strongly expressed wishes of the Canadian Govern-ment and of the stock interests in Canada in favour of the re-opening of a market withinthe Empire for her surplus store cattle are of the highest importance.We accordingly recommend that the Diseases of Animals Act, 1896, should be repealed, and section 26 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, revived. This course willenable the English Board of Agriculture to make Orders admitting animals into theUnited Kingdom from abroad without being subject to immediate slaughter at the ports,provided that the Board are satisfied that reasonable security is afforded against theimportation of diseased animals.. We further recommend that, immediately on the passing of the necessary legisla-tion, the Board of Agriculture should make an Order permitting the admission of cattlefrom Canada.A. Andeewes Uthwatt.F.

recommendations  on  importation of  store cattlefrom canada.ii.we are unable to recommend an alteration of the law which now prevents thoimportation of store cattle from canada. we come to this conclusion only after very careful consideration, and we much regret that it involves the rejection of a proposal which is supported by representatives ot the dominion.the present generation has almost forgotten the losses which stockbreeders enduredfrom the ravages of cattle plague, foot and mouth disease, and pleuro-pneumonia, and theextent to which the development of meat production in this country was checked bythe reluctance of stock owners to increase their liability to these risks. in one year(1883) nearly 500,000 animals were attacked by foot and mouth disease alone, and thaannual loss from pleuro-pneumonia was very heavy. successive measures were passed,providing an increasing degree of security, but the increase in the number of cattle wasslow. it was not until measures were adopted to prevent the introduction of livinganimals for distribution throughout the country, that stockbreeders felt secure, and the cattle of the country began steadily to increase.it is true that cattle born and bred in canada are exceptionally free from disease,and that such cattle, if sent direct from canadian ports to the united kingdom, would be unlikely to introduce disease of any kind. if the healthiness of cattle in canada werethe only fact to be considered, the issue would be simplified. the long open frontier between canada and the united state3, however, precludes us from regarding thequestion of risk of disease as being decided by the healthiness of canadian cattle alone.there is no doubt in our minds, and the evidence given by many farmers before thecommittee confirms it, that any relaxation of the statutory safeguards now providedagainst the introduction of disease would seriously alarm stockbreeders in all parts ofthe united kingdom. irish breeders, especially, express groat apprehension at thesuggestion of allowing the import of canadian stores. that alarm would immediately be reflected in a check to the breeding and rearing of stock, and for a long time to come,at any rate, would be likely to reduce very seriously the home production of meat. asthe committee was charged to have special regard to the development of meat productionin the united kingdom, we are unable to assent to an alteration in the law which in our judgement would have the effect of reducing the number of stock bred and reared athome, unless we are assured that any deficiency thus caused would be more than made good. nothing in the evidence gives this assurance. when canadian stores wereadmitted to this country, the maximum number of live animals sent over in any oneyear, 1890, was 121,000, of which about 40 per cent, were fat and were at onceslaughtered. since stores were excluded, the maximum number sent over was 191,000in 1903. during the war, when canada was making every effort to contribute to the meat supply but was unable to continue shipment to the united kingdom, she exportedabout 200,000 cattle per annum to the united states, while at the sam.3 time exportingabout 50,000 tons of beef.the interest of canada is admitted to lie in the development of an export trade inbeef, rather than in store cattle, and the canadian live stock commissioner indicated tothe committee the measures which the canadian government had taken, and were contemplating, with this object. he agreed that the canadian government would wishto retain power to regulate the export trade in stores, if,there were any danger that itwould interfere with the development of the dead meat trade, &quot; to which,&quot; he said, &quot; thegovernment is committed.&quot;it appears to us, therefore, that if canadian stores were re-admitted, the numbersreaching this country would be small, uncertain, and variable. having seriously disturbed the stable conditions under which british stock-breeders have built up theirherds during the past quarter of a century, the united kingdom might thus find itselfnot only without adequate compensation, but in a substantially worse position than ifcanada devoted all her energies to the development of her exports of dead meat or, ifnecessary, of fat cattle to this country.for these reasons we do not feel justified, under the terms of the committee&apos;reference, in recommending any relaxation of the condition which requires all importedcattle to be slaughtered at the ports, as we are convinced that the maintenance ofthis condition tends to increase, and not to diminish, the total meat supply of theunited kingdom.William c. Bridgeman.R. Henry Rew.
ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS.We have signed the above Report, as, subject to the two points mentioned below, weare in general agreement with its recommendations.1. British Meat Companies in South America.It is clear from the facts stated in paragraph 17 that the British Companies operating in South America are unable to hold their ground against the American Companies; andit is further clear that the licensing system proposed by paragraph 63 one of the uses ofAvhich is to control imported supplies, will of itself restrict and not augment such supplies. To ensure supplies it is necessary either that there should be a subsidy orguarantee of business to British works operating in South America so as to secure their continued existence or that the British Government should itself acquire and run works in Souch America. In either case it would be requisite that sufficient insulated shipping should be provided or controlled by the British Government.2. Shipping.Apart from the adoption of the suggestion made in 1, it is clear that the Plate andAustralasian Refrigerated Tonnage Committees referred to in paragraph 61 can do nothingunless there is power in fact to control insulated shipping, and in our opinion it isnecessary that such power of control should continue.A. Andrewes Uthwatt.F. T. Boys.NOTE BY SIR T. B. ROBINSON.I agree with paragraph 1, above, b*st not with paragraph 2.T. B. Robinson.
