Following for your Prime MinisterBegins -Ratification by America of the peace Treaty stillhangs in the balance and opponents of ratificationare making great play with the argument that if a&quot;dispute likely to lead to a rupture&quot; betwoen aForeign Power and tho United Kingdom, or any one ofthe four Dominions or India, were brought before theAssembly of the League under Article 15 all the otherfive votes could be cast in support of the part ofthe Empire immediately affected although the memberrepresenting it could net vote,    This is in ouropinion a wrong interpretation.    We hold that therepresentatives of all parts of the Empire would be debarred from voting in this particular case, i *e.,a &quot;Dispute likely to lead to a rupture&quot; between aForeign Power and any State of the Smnire.Cur Ambassador at Washington, Viscount Grey, isurging us most strongly to make a declaration tothis effect, which he believes would have a decisive&apos;influence on the American Senate&apos;s decision.    Butwe have refused to sanction this course without the assent of the Dominion Governments.    I should beglad to know at the earliest possible date whetheryour Government would approve of such a declarationbeing made ?    It would be made perfectly clear   ofcourse
course that the. declaration referred only to theparticular case just explained, which might arise under Article 15, and that in all other respects therights of the United Kingdom and the Dominions andIndia as six original Members of the League were not affected.It has, I ou.phi to add, also been contendedin the United States that British Empire should nothave more than one Member on Council of League at the same time, but His.KaiestyTs G-overnment hasrefused definitely to accept any reservation whichwould prejudice eligibility of a Dominion or of Indiato be selected as one of the &quot;four ether Members ofthe League&quot; ihose representatives are bo sit on theCouncil.     llie question was raised in Paris and president Wilson, Monsieur Clemenceau and the PrimeMinister gave a written assurance that in their viewrepresentatives of the Dominions might be selectedor named as members of the Council upon the trueconstruction of the first two paragraphs of Article 4of the Covenant.We are determined to adhere to this.   Ends.MILN2R.
