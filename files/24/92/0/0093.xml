During the reoent elections in Switzerlandmany of the extreme members lost their seats; in HollandOudegeest, one of Troelstra&apos;s supporters, has written to a friend saying that a tour in Germany has oonvinoed hia thatconstitutional government is the only possible form; in Prancethere has been t. split in the ranks of the extremists.In Germany a Spartaoist rising of some kind seems certainbefore the end of the year, but the Government will probablybe able to survive it.   It is believed in Holland that theMonarchists are fomenting trouble among the Spartaoifts in thehope of making a military dictatorship inevitable, and thereis also a belief that von der Goltz^ army is intended to bethe nucleus of a Monarchist foroe,   iftiere are rumours inGermany that Noske is toying with the idea ot a Monarchistreaotion.Plans are on foot to replace Friedrioh^ Government in hungary by a moderate 9ooial democratic regime headed by( Garami and Bishop Prohaszka, whioh would be speoially&apos; friendly to England.   The Roumanians are said to be at the bottom of the rumours that &quot;pogroms0 and a &apos;*White Terror&quot; would follow immediately upon their withdrawal.It/
It now seems oertain that neither Mosoow nor Petrograd Ioan be taken before the spring.   The Soviet Government is    flas aotive as ever in propaganda; with the assistance ofthe Bolsheviks in Amerioa speoial agents are being sentover to Franoe and this oountry: the neoessary measures arebeing taken.There have been numerous reports that oertain sectionsof the Zionists have Bolshevik sympathies, but, on the otherhand, the Zionist leaders in Petrograd were imprisoned andTohitoherine complains that organised Zionism is a solidcounter-revolutionary body.In Norway, too, there is a reaction against the BolsheviParty, and in Denmark speoial legislation is being introduoecto deal with Bolshevik and Spartaoist agitators,She Afghan Mission to M0300W has asked the EsthonianGovernment to give it a free passage to Berlin &quot;toparticipate in the Peaoe Conference.w   The new TurkishGovernment is believed to be inclined towards the nationalists and there is a general wave of Fan-Islamismin the Near East.   It is hoped to send emissaries intoPersia for anti-British propaganda.   The anti-british feeling in Egypt appears to be increasing,The ooal strike and the general unrest in the &quot;UnitedStates have dwarfed every other question.   The moderateleaders of Lc/bour are losing influence and the powerappears to be passing into the hands of Extremists.Naturally their propaganda finds a ready hearing among theforeigners who form ao large a part of the industrial population.   In the industrial ferment, the danger thatthe agitation among the Negroes may oome to a head is iapt to be lost sight of; a Negro disturbance in the UnitedStates might reaot very seriously upon the West Indies and west Afrioa, to which colonies a good deal of inflammatorypropaganda has been sent.In Canada the Canadian Trades and Labour Congressnegatived every proposal whioh supported the &quot;One BigUnion&quot; movement.A Communist Party has been formed in Mexioo,
Interest is now becoming centred in the forthcoming ..elections,   The Socialists are endeavouring to raise a fund of a million franos in order to carry on theirpropaganda and to combat the &quot;Capitalists&quot; at the polls.This appeal for money was signed by I, Albert Thomas,Longuet, Poisson, Severao and other leaders, but up tothe middle of last month only a little over 12,000francs had been obtained,   The Socialists are carryingon a vigorous campaign against the Government.   Incriticizing the polioy of the Entente in ittissia they aremaking use of the same arguments that are employed bythe English Extremists, namely that the Allies not onlyintend to oruah Lenin and Trotsky, but also propose toreintroduce the old political system and to perpetuatemilitarism.   The court martial of Captain Sadoul, whobelonged to the French Military Mission to Russia in1917, and joined the Bolsheviks, is causing considerableindignation among the extremists.   Saoloul has been selected as one of the socialist candidates for the1 department of the 3eine and the Governments decisionto try him is held to be a direot challenge to theSooialist party,   The French Communist group in Moscow-has addressed a message to the French Government, theFrench Communists, the Confederation Generale du Travailand all workers protesting against 8adoul&apos;s court,martial,and has called upon organized workers to display theirhatred and seem of the &quot;renegades&quot; who have betrayedthem.   The word &quot;renegades&quot; induces not only M. Clemenceau,but also-MM. -Albert Thomas and Longuet.The. Socialist Party in France at the present timeseems/
seems to be passing through a fresh crisis in its career.Its refusal to coi?.aborate with the other parties on the left of the Chamber and its elimination from its electoral!list of all candidates who voted for war oredits, has begun to odnvinoe the public that the party has adopted theprinciples of Bolshevism and is committed to a polioy of violence,   It is reported that the Sooialist leaders areoonsoious of the suspioion that is being aroused and thatthey ere anxious about the attitude towards their policyof the demobilized soldiers at the coming elections.They seem to anticipate strong opposition from these men.In this connection, however, it must be remembered that&quot;I/Assooiation riepublioaine des Anoiens Combabtants&quot; whiohwas inaugurated in 1917 by Henri Barbu3se,   the well-knownauthor and journalist, and Vidal, and now has a membership Iof about 1,000,000, is avowedly a Socialist corporation willextreme politioal views.The &quot;Liberte&quot;&quot;, which has been inquiring into the causes of the strike of arsenal and metal workers which toolplace at Brest in October, affirms that the strike was of 8revolutionary oharacter and would have resulted in theestablishment of a &quot;Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot; at brest had not the troops remained loy-3.1.   The dockers atMarseilles have been conoeded a rate of pay of 4 franosan hour instead of 2-25 for work in the. rain.   It i3suggested that a logical sequence of this new concession to labour would be to double the pay of sailors when thesea is rough!   It is reported that crime is prevalent inMarseilles, but the reoent murder of the Secretary of&apos;theiSailwaymen&apos;8 Union has brought matters to a head,   its a    jresult of this crime, the railwaymen have shown a zeal forlpublio security which they have previously not displayed  Iand/ I
and they are urging the municipal authorities to. protect them when they go on night duty.   The high cost of living in France shows no sign of diminishing and is being used as, an election ory by the Socialists.   The soaroity of silvercoin, whioh appears to be largely due to hoarding, is also being used as an eleotion cry, the Socialists allegingthat the bourgeoisie, in fear of eventualities, are.converting their securities into coin which they are sending out of the country.   The high rate of exchange is stilloausing anxiety and is used to promote ill-feeling againstIS-Great Britain.   The British are oharged with deliberately .encouraging a bad rate of exchange in order to seize theFrench markets.   Meanwhile the Frenoh are cultivating tradewith the Germans beoause the money exohange operates in their favour,   Ohe Amerioans ,are less unpopular in France than theywere, as it is considered th&amp;t they are doing a good deal toassist the restoration of the devastated area.BELGIUMIt is not possible to form an aoourate forecast with: regard to.the result of.the General Election whioh is&apos;to takeplaoe towards the end of this month.   The three prinoipalpolitical parties are the Catholics, the Liberals and theSocialists,   It is thought that the Catholics, who may besaid to represent conservative opinion as it is understoodin England, will suffer heavy losses in the ooming elections,owing to recent reforms in the eleotoral system, whioh havebroadened the basis of representation, and to the discontentagainst the present administration.   The ohances of theLiberal Party, which represents the middle olasses andsmaller/
smaller commercial interests and endeavours to steer a middle oourse between the Catholics and the Socialists, arenot particularly bright.   The Socialists, who have gained in strength during the war, appear to be in the strongestposition, but their chance of success ia complicated   owingto internal differences in the party and to the connectionwhioh existed between oertain Socialists and the Germanswith regard to the Flemish question during the war.If the Socialists succeed in obtaining a majorityover either the Catholios or the Liberals, it is not unlikely that the two latter pax-ties may form a ooalitionto avoid the possibility of a Sooialist Government.Although there are no strikes at the moment, a dangerousundercurrent of unrest is reported to exist, especiallyamong Government employees.   There has been a noticeabledecrease of.press criticism against Great. Britain andthe recent lean of  50,000,000 has given oonsiderablesatisfaction -in commercial and financial oiroles.   dheNational Socialist Bureau (Seoond International) has been moved from Amsterdam to Brussels,,The xiailway Strike in England.has not been,thesubject of much Press comment since the Government, fearingthat Press publicity would re-act on the iiailway workersin Belgium, took steps to suppress news of events inEngland, while the strike was in progress.SWITZEjl&amp;ND :There is evidence to show that the Swiss CommunistParty is laoking both in organization and funds.   its activities seem to be oonfined at present to secretpropaganda.   Ihe leaders of the Extremists in Switzerlandare mostly foreigners who dare not make themselves tooprominent/
prominent owing to the severe measures whioh have at last been taken to suppress their activities.   TheAustrian and Italian Extremista seem to be the mostactive in Switzerland.   It is reported that the swiss government is now taking aotion to prevent members of theYoung Turk Barty from entering or settling in Switzerland.Ejavid Bey and Ismail Hakkl have been served with deportationorders and Taleat Pasha and Djemal JFasha have been refused permission to come into the country.   Ihe effectof these restrictions will presumably prevent the plan ofthe Young Turks to.make Lausanne a centre for theirmovement,   itfeanwfaile, however, it is reported that theFrench and Italians are secretly supporting the Turkishand Egyptian Nationalist interests in Switzerland andthat funds for these movements ere being provided from french sources,   The American Minister at Berne reoentlymade an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the expulsionof John de Kay from Switzerland on the ground that hewas an undesirable American without a passport.   De Kayis in olose relationship with Hector Dominquezwhountil a short time agoj was the Mexican Consul general at Berne in the Cai^Ranza interest.   It is believed-thatDominquez and Miss Alice Vegger, rie Kay&apos;s secretary,have been entrusted with an extremist mission on behalfof de Kay to the United States.   Up to the presentthe elections in Switzerland have been marked by a seriesof heavy defeats for the Socialists.   This seems to showthat the people are alarmed by the affection displayedby so many of the Socialists for Lenin^ ThirdInternational.   Ihe handling of the railway strike inGreat Britain has had an exoellent effeot in Switzerland,where/
to-    6where the result of the strike ia considered as one of thegreatest viotories of the &quot;Party of Order&quot; which has beenwon sinoe the beginning of the present labour trouble.GERMANYHeports which are so consistent in character thatthey deserve attention indioate that the part&amp;oists intend to attempt the overthrow of the BberVNoske Government assoon as their plans are matured.   Doouments which havefallen into the hands of the police oonfirm the rumours of impending trouble.   Sp&amp;rtaoist outbreaks are ejectedin Dusseldorf, in the fluhr distriot, and in SouthernGermany Essen is the centre of the Communist activities and&quot;there is evidence for believing that the communists and Independents are united for the coming revolutionaryrising..  It is apparently to be started by a general strike.In this connection, it is interesting to note the formationof a Preiearbeiter Union whioh extends all over Germany andis, in reality, the German branoh of the Industrial. workers of the World.   Shis Union has a non-political programme, butit is organized under the auspices of the extremeIndependent Socialists and represents a revolt against theold Trade Unions and their methods.   Herr Friesland, a well-to-do business man, but a oonvinoed Communist, asserts that85$ of the workers in Germany will obey the order to strike,The Government seems alive to the dangers whioh threaten it,and is taking vigorous aotion to suppress disorder,   ilSportaoist meeting in Meoklenburg was broken up by theState Defence Corps; many persons were arrested, including two russians, and much inoriminating material and arms wereseized/
seized.   The Berlin polioe have also seized a largenumber of pamphlets which were intended to inoite theworkers to violence.   These pamphlets were published by anew organization called &quot;The Communist Party for the furtherance of a Dictatorship of the Proletariat.&quot;In the faoe of strikes and possible disorders, itis scarcely surprising that the idea of the restorationof the monerohy which is being promoted by the NationalParty is said to be gaining ground.   Noske is reportedto be in favour of a reasonable oounter-revolution,but to what extent he is prepared to go towards restoring the Monarohy is not clear.In Government oiroles in Holland it is believed thatthe Monarchist Party is deliberately fomenting a Spartaoistrising in the hope of a military dictatorship succeedingthe disorders.   They also believe that Von der Goltz&apos;sforce is the nucleus of a future Monarchist Army.For the present the existing Government oan probablycount upon the support of the moderate elements in thepopulation and it should be able to cope with anySpartaoist rising, provided that the troops remain loyal.The question of whether or not the IndependentSooialist Party is to join the Third International isto be decided at the Party meeting to be held at Leipzigon the 16th of this month.   The Spartaoist party inBerlin has sent Franz Burring, Alfred Sedlltz and FritzSohneide to Moscow to report upon the situation inGermany and to aek for funds.   The International YoungSooialist Organization, which has established a bureau atStuttgart, is stated to be contemplating some kind of revolutionary movement on the 7th of November - the anniversary of the russian devolution - in conjunctionwith/
with the Shird International and the Women&apos;s InternationalThe food, coal and housing conditions in the occupied territory are reported to be growing worse and trouble     ^in respeot of strikes and unemployment may be expeotedduring the winter.   The question of the establishment ofa rhenish republic lias fallen into the background.   Itis reported that measures are being concerted in Germanyto protect the officers who are to be delivered to theEntente Powers under the penalty clauses in the peace treaty.   Many of them have already been assisted toleave the country.   The notorious German agent, Pervua,is said now to be in Christiania, where he has a seoretbureau for pro-German propaganda.   Kis purpose is to influence delegates to the Labour Ccnference- in washington to press for amendments to the Peace Treo,ty in favour ofGermany.   Similar propaganda is being engineered inSwitzerland and among the Jews in Holland end the unitedStates.AU3T.:iIA   &apos; - -After the Bill for the ratification of the Feaoe &apos;Treaty had been adopted by the National Assembly withoutdebate, Dr. tenner and his Cabinet resigned.   Dr. Henner. was then re-elected as State Chancellor and formed a coalition Government.   Herr Bauer has no place in thepresent Government and Dr. ^ieiaoh ha3 succeeded HerrSohumpeter as Secretary of State for Finance.   Atpresent there does not appear to be any strong Bolshevik*element among the population.   The Coramunist party un austria Is small and its funds are soaroe,   Any troublesand riots which may occur during the coming winter willbe due to the prevailing poverty and the want of fuel and food/
food.   Pood can still be obtained, but the prices areprohibitive and the sufferings of the poor in Vienna areacute.   The eoonomio odnditions are governed by the needfor coal and the adverse rate of exohange.   It seems doubtfulwhether the Government is strong enough to cooperate with thesituation, and the faot that many of its members are of theJewish faith does not strengthen its position.   The anti-Semitic movement appears to be gaining ground and it issaid to be supported by the Ban-Genaan party.   It isdoubtful, however, whether a union with Germany would be popular, although it is still mooted and is advocated by herr Bauer,   Great Britain is the least unpopular of theEntente Powers and the Government, whioh views withapprehension the considerable influenoe that the italians and Prenoh are obtaining in the country, is reported to be anxious for British assistance.   Up to the present timeGreat Britain has shown ho interest in Austria eitherofficially or privately,-   !there appears to be a strong movement for forming arepresentative Hungarian government; the leader is EmoOarami , the chief of the Worfenen^ Social DemocraticParty,   This man&apos; refused to join the Bela Kan administra-tion and was sent out of the country in oonsequenoe; as a- measure of his honesty, it is said that the  700 given tohim by.Bela Kun was faithfully given back to the treasury on his return.   He Is how wooing&apos; with Roland von Hegedus,a banker, who refused the post of Finance Minister under: the Heinrich and Friedrieh administrations.   Furthermembers of this group are Gabbr Ugron. Istvan Szabo andBishop Ottokar Prohaszka.   Hhe last named is very popularon aoceunt of his charities, for he gives away most of hisemoluments/
emoluments to the poor; he is a strong opponent of theuse of ohuroh funds for the personal benefit of the bishops. ,There is a strong suspicion that the itxwmanlans are[seoretly assisting the Communist Party, who are allowedto propagate their views on-oondition,that they advocateRumanian rule and prophesy a massacre of the Jews and a&quot;White Terror&quot; as soon as the Rumanian army withdraws,-The.press accounts of a White Terror appear to have beenlvery muoh exaggerated.Polling for the elections in Italy begins on thel6th of November.   It 3eems probable that -the newCatholic Popular Party and the Jocialiats will addlargely to their numbers * but,the general opinionseems to be. that the present Government will return witha majority, however uncertain in its allegianoe thatmajority may be.   The l6th National Congress of theItalian Sooialist Party, whose total membership issupposed to be 80,000, was held at Bologna in October.Miss gylvia Pankhurst spoke on behalf of toe BritishCommunist Party, whioh she olfcimed to represent.   TheCongress passed a resolution declaring its adherence toBthe Third International, but the faot that the ItalianSooialists thus adopted the Bolsheviks&apos; programme does iamount to muoh, as the party is divided and most of itsmore influential members are opposed to Bolshevism.   Inaddition to this, it must be remembered that theSooialists are a small minority and cannot be said torepresent the Proletariat,   The labour organizations leu]towards/
towards Socialism, but they are opposed to revolutionarymethods and the Catholio elements in the syndicatesand leagues disapprove of direct action.   It wasdecided at the Congress that the Socialist Party should participate in the General election. - At a meeting ofthe Executive Committee of the Italian -Socialist Partywhioh was held at Imola about the 12th of Ootober, it wasdecided to form a special office for internationalpropaganda and Constantino Lazzari was placed in chargeof the bureau, his place as Secretary of the.ItalianSocialist Party being taken by Bombaooi.    ;...The Piume question still remains unsettled,11&apos;Annunzio has deolared to Admiral Cagin that he doesnot recognize the Italian Government, but it is reportedthat he has come to an arrangement with the ItalianGeneral Staff for joint aotion between his foroes andthe riegular Italian troops in the event of a Jugo-Slavattaok.   Two generals hove joined D&apos;Arinunzioand hispopularity is said to be undimimshed.   Hhia enthusiasm,however,.oannot last indefinitely, especially as theoommerdial situation in Piume is becoming serious,   ManyItalian firms whioli had brought goods there to sell inJugO-Slavia and Hungary are sending them baok to Italy.It is hot improbable that the policy of the Governmentis to let time settle  &quot;Annunzio^s popularity.   Ihe reportwni^oh appeared &quot;in the press recently that D&apos;Annunzio had issued a decree on the 18th of Ootober placing Flume undermartial law may be the beginning of the end of histheatrical exploit,   &quot;jfoe Italian Government is devoting300,000 lire for the Italian Foreign Office Seoret Servioeexpenses in Palestine and Syria during 1919-20.   It isunderstood/
understood that the Italian policy will toe directed tothe defence of Italian interests against French predominejmmWhile there are no further symptoms of Bolshevism in greece, there are certainly dangers to the Monarchist Parand I am assured from a good source that a declaration thithe Allies will not tolerate the return of King Constant!;&apos; would have a stabilising effeot. Many of tho old familieiare seoretly or openly Constantinista, more particularlyin the peloponnessus, and the late king has manysupporters in Alexandria. Ifce great&apos;danger is that anattempt should be made on the life of K. Venizelos. Ohepopular dislike of the Italians is unabated and the attempt at an Italian-Greek raoproohement is an artifioiamovement.&apos; the Italians are paying oertain Greek newspaperto insert pro-Italian propaganda.The Greek Government has a short way with such ofits subjects who are likely to engage in revolutionarypropaganda: they are not deported from the country, butthey are relegated to oertain Greek islands with a population that may be counted on the fingers.HOUMAfllAThere is considerable unrest in lioumania and troubliis not unlikely to arise during the course of the oomingelections, The present Liberal Government is unpopular,but, owing to the internal discords in the conservative party, it seems likely that the Liberals will be successful at the polls. (Pake Jonesou has inaugurateda new party called the &quot;Democratic Unionist Party&quot;. &apos; It^lprogramme includes a conciliatory attitude towards theEntente/
Entente Powers; the formation of a block with the 3tatesneighbouring Rumania to seoure peaoe in the Orient; aguarantee to respect, in new rtcumania, the ethnical, politioaland religious equality of all minorities; the upkeep of the universal, seoret and direot vote, and the formation of aSenate eleoted by proportional representation.   It is not expected that the new party.will have c large following,Ike decision of the Nationalist and Socialist parties not toput forward candidates at the elections is oaualng the liberals some uneasiness.The year1 s harvest has been an exceptionally goodone and there should be a lerge amount of maize forexportation.CZECHOSLOVAKIAIt seems oertain that there is a strong movement forseparation in Slovakia, and active propaganda is being oarriedon by the Poles and Hungarians in Slovakia with a view toeffecting a breach between the Slovaks and the Czeohs.   Theattitude of the Ozeohs towards the 31ovaks has been one of extreme intolerance, and the feeling in Slovakia is now reportedto be in favour of a Union with Hungary.The feeling in German Bohemia is also becoming antagonisticto the Czeohs and it is olear that the German Bohemians willbreak away and attach themselves to Germany or Austria, unless some aotion is taken to moderate their disoontent.Czeoho-Slovakia is over-orowded with officials and the&quot;Young Czech Party&quot; is reported to be dragooning the countryaccording to the best traditions of the Prussian Junkers.General dissatisfaotion is expressed against the present government, the only member of whioh who still enjoys anypopularity being Benes, the Minister for Foreign affairs.It/

But,although Communist propaganda isundoubtedi^ well-organized and aotive in Poland, theredoes not seem to be much prospect of its capturing thecountry.&apos;  itie recent strike of agricultural labourers atone time assumed a distinctly revolutionary character,but the movement was oonflned to f&amp;issiaii, Poland.,and., the..4, .,j-y &apos;*i**.     *     :        .r ^ .... il 1,4       1 &quot;&apos;peasants did&apos;not attempt to occupy their employers1 landsby force,   &quot;Eie1 strong action of the Government in the suppression of this strike has greatly; strengthened-itsprestige.   The question of stopping the war with&apos; SovietKuasla has now reached the stage of Parliamentary, discussio:This poll by is advocated by the Socialists,   On the otherhand/ &quot;
-i5- 468hand, a movement has been inaugurated in Podolia andYolhynia for trie formation of an international army in poland to liberate these two provinces from the Bolsheviks,in order that their future may be deoicierj by the Leagueof Nations.   The leader of this movement is a priest namedSoharbahoaki, who, it is reported, has already reoruited10,000 men.   He belongs to the Moderate eight and is supported by the people, but is not backed by the GeneralStaff of the Polish Army.   The Germans are aotive in Poland.Their policy is to effect the oomplete isolation of thecountry in order ultimately to bring it unde;4 the tutelageof Germany.   Germrn goods are reaching Poland viaSwitzerland and under French trade marks, and it is reportedthat German and Jewish oapital is being invested in Poland.Many German firms are acquiring interests in Polish oonoeras.German propaganda is also aotive to create among the Polesill-feeling against the billies.FINLANDIn Finland   the Socialist Party in divided into three groups, the &quot;riight SocialistsB who ac3vooate pure SocialDemooraoy and acoept the medium of Parliament for the attainment of their political aims; the MLeft Socialists&quot;who are in favour of passive revolutionary aotion and parliamentary representation; and the Communists whoadhere to the !Biird International.   They are opposed toparliomentary representation and their object is theintroduction of the Soviet system in Finland.   Although the&quot;Left Socialists&quot; in theory condemn Bolshevik methods, there appears to be a fairly olcse connection between them and the communists,foe/
The Finnish Government has.refuged the invitation whiohYudenitoh and Koltohok are reported.to.have:made to it to intervene in the attack on the Soviet. Government in i&amp;issia.Writing from Paris, General. lyonnerheim has addressed anappeal to President Jtohlberg to oo-opcrate,with the -antirBolshevikssad it is stated that large bodies oftroops are concentrating round help?in.gfors awaiting the arrival of M&amp;nnerheim.-l31.ii.The Soviet Government is still in power and the badlyorganized and inadequate raid of the White ^rmy from theNorth-went on Petrograd has ended in failure.   Trotsky, whohas suppressed the soldiers&apos; councils at the front and givenentire freedom of action to the officers, has had nodifficulty in raying Petrograd: Koltehak is again in, retreat.Typhus is reported, to have broken out in KoltohokVs army andthe fighting efficiency of the troops seems doubtful.It now seems, oertain that neither Moscow,nor Petrogradcan fall until the spring,; Uenikin alone, .1s holding his own,and for climatic reasons he is. unlikely, to move forwardbeyond Orel during the winter.. ; ... ,  ....... ,Military success on the-$astern front would appear to depend largely, if not entirely, on propaganda.   At-presentthe anti-Bolshevik propaganda is conspicuous by its absence,chiefly owing to the lack ofliterature^and printing,materials, whereas the. Bolshevik.agents are active, cominginto Siberia disguised as refugees.   There.are persistentrumours that Ivanov-hinoy, leader of, the Monarchist group in the east , has superseded Koltohak, but there is no official confirmation of thi*? report.   The Soviet Governmentappears/
appears to have given up the idea of trying to form a coalition with any other parties.   Troteky ju? reported tohave declared his intention of establishing a dictatorshipin such an event.   The number of the profesoec1 supporters of Communism, however, is shrinking rapidly,    Lnovleffhimself stated reoently that the total number of communists in cassia is 300,000, a number which he him-elf consideredrather small.   The Communist newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; informed itsreaders that the Communist pc-rty in Petrograd had sunkto a membership of 9,000 as againet 50,000 in 1918, andit asserted tort of the 9.000 a majority neither understoodCommunism nor believed in it.   It i? reported that Kraesin.Commissar of Ways and Means, lias come to the conclusion thatCommunism cannot save the country and that his public avowalof this fact h&amp;s led to a split among the principalCommissars.   The failure of the Soviet Government to gainthe confidence of the peasants&apos;&quot;, the growing hostility of theChuroh under the patriotlo leadership of the Patriarch Tikhon,the corruption and disorganization in trie administration andthe financial &quot;bankruptcy amply justify-Krassinls view of thesituation.   In the first half of the ourrent year there wasa deficit of 30 milliards in the&apos;Bolshevik budget and it isreliably stated that the value of the caper money in circulation i,? one hundred billion roubles.   The food supply in petrograd appears to be rather larger than it was, but themethods of distribution show no signs of improvement.   Inkosoow the dearth of food has led to disturbances - working hours in the latter city are  aid to have been increased from to 12 hours a day, owing to the seriousness of the present&apos;situation.It/
It is reported that German propaganda is being oarriedon in Fetrogrt-d and Mosoow with considerable energy, amongbotli the :iedt* and Whites.   German agents are particularly anxious to get into the White organizations, offering themfull support and asking for nothing in return.   A certainHilfius appears to be at the head, of the German agency intto^oow.   his object appears to consist in keeping in touohwith the Bolsheviks and, et the   same time, in attempting tosecure the interests of Germany with the Whites.

It is hoped that the result of tlrailway strike in Great Britain, whioh all the Dutch news-papers, with the exception of &quot;Het Volk&quot;, considered a victory for the Government, may have a salutary effeot onagitators.   In this connection, however, some remarks ofBdo Fimmen, Secretary of the International Trade unionConfederation and an Intellectual Sooialist of Amsterdam,are worthy of attention.
