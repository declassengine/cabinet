This is the latest development inthe battles which have been waged by the miners throughout this year, and in watching the campaign two points of interest can be distinguished the ultimate objective of theminers, and their methods of attempting to win it. The second of these, however, hasbeen dealt with more than once. It is proposed here to make some reference to thefirst, and in regard to that to consider the part to be played by workpeople&apos;s organisationsin the control of a nationalised scheme, because in spite of the amount of argument thatthere has been about nationalisation, this is a point upon which there appears to be muchdoubt and obscurity, which may be the,cause of difficulty and misunderstanding in thenear future.(0 1908] 255 11/19 HA 8 3 JJ    &quot;
The leaders of the campaign have indicated that one of their main reasons for advocat-&apos;4ng nationalisation is that&quot;it will give the workpeople&apos;s organisations a controlling voice.But the one point of the greatest importance which does not seem to have been clearlybrought out, and is apparently not fully realised, at any rate by many of the workpeople&apos;sleaders, is that if there is a Minister responsible to Parliament for the conduct of theindustry he must have complete control, and no industrial Council can exercise the samecontrol. The miners&apos; representatives in particular do not appear to have adequatelyRealised this, with the result that they are apt to talk as if they would get more in theWay of control out of nationalisation than they possibly can. The functions of the work-sople&apos;s organisations under a nationalised scheme would appear to be confined to (a)argaining with regard to remuneration, &amp;c, if possible, as has already been suggested,with some direct representatives of the users and consumers of the goods and servicesproduced on the other side of the table, so as to create a balance of opposing economicforces, and avoid burdening such an unsuitable body as the central executive governmentWith the responsibility unaided of coming to decisions that are bound to be regarded asarbitrary ; (6) performing what may be called the workpeople&apos;s side of Joint IndustrialCouncil work, i.e., negotiating and advising as regards working conditions ; and finally(c) advising as regards general management and control.It is highly desirable from all points of view, however, that as much effect shouldhe given to the suggestions of workpeople&apos;s representatives as is practicable ; if it were found possible in practice for the responsible Minister over a large field to act on advice from this quarter almost automatically, there is little doubt that it would be all to thegood, Everything should clearly be done to render strikes in nationalised industries less likely, and it is possible to do more to this end than the mere creation of machinery for preventing disputes from developing into strikes. Some arrangement whereby the work-people may be satisfied that they can obtain their wants without a dispute arising wouldalso go far towards this end ; and they cannot be satisfied that they will obtain whatthey Want unless they have some power to influence the granting of what they want.For this reason alone it would be desirable to make the managerial weight of the trade unionsas great as possible. This would be an advantage also from the point of view of theState, for the State would thus place on the shoulders of the Trade Unions themselves theresponsibility for so organising industry as to eliminate grievances. Given such a position the trade unions would be transformed from fighting weapons into the chief instrument for industrial organisation, and provided with a responsibility commensurate with their powers.The question at once arises, of course, how far in such, circumstances nationalisationin its ordinary sense is adequate ; that is, will it be possible in practice to assign to a merelyadvisory body sufficient responsibility to achieve these ends ? There is no doubt at allthat a constructive spirit is abroad among the trade unions at present, not only in thisbut in other countries. One phase of this as has been pointed out before, is the tendencynow exhibited to look beyond the act of downing tools, which has resulted in the organisa-tion of supplies by strike Committees, as seen in Belfast, Winnipeg, and other places.But another and quite as important a phase is seen, e.g., in the recent suggestion madeby Mr. Cramp that the centre of gravity is in fact shifting from Parliament to the &quot; TradeUnion Offices.&quot; Mr. Cramp forgot to mention that there is probably quite as good reasonfor supposing that it is shifting also to, e.g., the F.B.I. or the big combines ; and thetendency is a very real one in the case of the Joint Committee of the Industrial Conference.Here we have seen two Bills negotiated between the Government and the Committeewhich the two parties are rather inclined to think are now simply to go before parliament for ratification. That there has not been perfect agreement, and that some of the battlesalready waged during the sittings of the Committee look very like being fought out once more on the floor of the House is beside the mark, even as it would be beside the mark tosuggest that because the Cabinet was the final negotiator in the railway dispute therefore the Cabinet is the main executive authority in the case of the railways. The point is thatif there had been agreement the Cabinet would not have been concerned at all; andequally in the case of the Joint Committee, if there had been agreement between theparties negotiating there, it is doubtful how much power would have been left to Parlia-ment in the matter, although the issues are issues which vitally affect the whole community.There is in fact a tendency at work in the direction of a devolution-quite otherthan territorial devolution-namely by function. It is the inevitable outcome of thedevelopment of organisation in every sphere. Specialised representation has outstrippedthe more roundabout general representation embodied in State machinery. Everywherethis tendency is at work; it is at the root of the suggestion quoted earlier that wages, &amp;c,should be negotiated in the case of nationalised industries if possible with representatives
of consumers or users of the goods and services produced, so as to gain an economicbalance. It can no longer be pretended that the representatives of the Governmentrepresent the consumer as the Trade Union Officials represent the producer. The question,therefore is, in view of these tendencies, how far the scheme represented by nationalisationin which the specialised representation of the workers finds only an advisory voice willi be adequate. There are, of course, in existing conditions many practical objections to &amp;&quot; transformation even gradual to a system allowing more power to specialised represen-tation, but it is a mistake to suppose, as is often done, that such a transformation wouldmean the stripping from Parliament of its essential functions. Parliament originally&apos;existed for the maintenance of law and liberty, the peculiarity of which is that they do-not admit of any specialisation of representation, since all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law. Its original function can never be stripped from Parliament. Anything whichis done in the way of extending the sphere of specialised representation will rather be inthe nature of unloading from Parliament a number of functions it was never intended tohave and restoring it unhampered to its original position in the body politic.Part II-Departmental.Juvenile Employment and Employment Committees.The general conditions of juvenile employment are now reported to be very nearlynormal throughout the country with few exceptions. The number of boys and girls onthe live registers of the Exchanges, however, has shown during recent months some slight tendency to increase. The total on the 27th June was approximately 27,000. Onthe 17th October the latest date for which statistics are available the number on the livbregister was just over 31,000, of whom some 17,000 were boys; and the total has beenapproximately on the same level for some weeks past. It must be remembered, however,that boys and girls of school-]eaving age are now retained in the schools until the enctof the term, and this will naturally tend to produce considerable seasonal increases inthe live register when term ends. This factor has been operating during the period underconsideration, and the increased live register is due no doubt in part to the unabsorbedresidue of children leaving school.Some displacement of juvenile workers in consequence of the return of men from theForces is still occurring and must be taken into account. The railway strike had also some effect in increasing the number of juveniles registered at Exchanges. In the York-shire and East Midlands Division the coal strike produced a very considerable rise in thenumber of unemployed juveniles, but the position has gradually been re-established, and unemployment among juvenile workers in the Division has fallen very nearly two-thirds,since the end of August.The reduction in the amount of donation payable to boys and girls, and other-administrative changes in the scheme, have affected the number of juvenile recipientsof the donation, but some indication of an improvement in employment conditions maybe gathered from the fact that on the 10th October the number of boys and girls in receiptof out-of-work donation only just exceeded 6,000, which is approximately half of the tot^tin receipt of donation on the 27th June. It has been found possible to close down all but17 of the Juvenile Unemployment Centres established by the Board of Education,and at the centres open only a little over 500 juveniles are in attendance. preparations were made during the railway strike to meet the possibility of extended unemploymentby reopening a number of these centres, but it fortunately was unnecessary to take this step.Special measures were taken in a number of cases by the Exchanges and the JuvenileEmployment Committees to deal with the problems presented by the fixed school-leavingperiod. In the London area especially these measures were distinctly successful. Arrange-ments were made for a selected number of children to visit the Exchanges during schoolhours, and by the co-operation of the teachers much was done to make clear the possibilitiesof suitable employment. In some cases arrangements were made for interviews withprospective employers during school hours, and in general by taking steps to grade th*echildren in accordance with information obtained at school conferences and rota.com-mittee meetings much difficulty in placing applicants for work was avoided.Progress has been made in the establishment of committees to supervise the placingand the conditions of employment of juvenile workers. Action has been taken in some areas by the Ministry of Labour, which has continued to set up Juvenile Advisory Com-(C 1908) 3 E2-
rhittees under the Labour Exchanges Act, and in other areas by, local education authorities,who are setting up Juvenile Employment Committees under the Education (Choice ofEmployment) Act. Committees recently constituted by the Ministry of Labour havebeen set up in various centres, accounting for a total population of some 700,000.Co-operation between the local education authorities and the Department has not ingeneral proved a difficult matter. It has not, however, always been possible for theDepartment to concur in the schemes submitted by local education authorities undertook^ie Choice of Employment Act. In these cases, as, for example, in Wakefield andWillesden, it has been felt necessary to set up Juvenile Advisory Committees connectedwith the Exchanges. The Local Employment Committees have taken a very considerable interest in this work, and in several cases where negotiations with the local educationauthorities as to the type of committee to be set up have proved prolonged or difficult,or where the Local Employment Committee have held that immediate action was neces-sary, Juvenile Advisory Committees have been set up provisionally, pending a settlementof the points at issue. An interesting recent development in the application of the pro-visions of the two Acts authorising the establishment of these Committees has been theinstitution, in a fairly large number of cases, of committees covering a whole county ora division of a county. Choice of Employment Committees have been at work for sometime in Cornwall, Middlesex and Wiltshire, and a similar committee for Denbighshireapproved in 1913 has recently been brought into renewed activity. These broadercommittees have in some cases superseded earlier local committees established in thecounty area. Thus a scheme for Kent, in which the Ministry of Labour has recentlyagreed to co-operate, takes the place of eight smaller schemes previously established in towns in that county. Fourteen other schemes for the establishment of these widercommittees are now under consideration. In establishing Juvenile Advisory Committeeshitherto, the policy of the Ministry of Labour has been to set them up in areas whichform single industrial units, but Juvenile Advisory Committees set up by the ministry are now in operation in Shropshire and Herefordshire.i Much is now being done to expand the after-care work carried on by the JuvenileAdvisory Committees in connection with children placed in employment by the labour exchanges, a work which, while by no means at a standstill during the war, could not beextended. A general endeavour is now being made to enlist new workers and to establish a comprehensive system of after-care work. Many Juvenile Advisory Committees areassociating themselves in this work with the Juvenile Organisation Committees set up during the war at the suggestion of a Home Office Committee to deal with the problemof recreation and welfare for juveniles. The welfare work of the Ministry of Munitions forboys and girls was closely linked up with that carried on by these Committees, whichhave now been transferred to the Board of Education. By co-operation of this kind it.should be possible to carry out this necessary work in a more efficient and thoroughmanner than has hitherto been feasible.Part III.  Press Comments.1 (1) The Labour and Socialist Press.[A) International and Foreign Affairs. \Russia.. The publication in Berlin of a note to the German Government from the supreme council at Paris inviting its co-operation in an economic blockade of Russia, excites theattention of Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and Mr. F. W. Jowett in thejMerthyr &quot; Pioneer.&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden regards it as an interesting commentary uponthe League of Nations, and as a proof that the capitalist allies will trample internationalJaw and every moral principle under foot, to destroy a power and a form of government&apos; which they think stand in the way of their ambitions and aims. Mr. F. W. Jowett thinkit a further proof of the need for stopping secret diplomacy. It is a proof to him also thatthe war has failed to end war. He devotes, however, the main part of his article to thestarvation and famine which he maintains will result in Russia from this policy of blockade.&quot; The Call &quot; suggests that the fulfilling of the pledge to evacuate British troops from north russia is but. an empty satisfaction, and that so far as main principles are concerned theBritish people has not yet succeeded in asserting its will in respect of Russian interventionon any single point.   This paper insists that the issue is no longer the mere withdrawal of
troops or even the mere cessation of supplies to the Anti-Bolshevist troops... In order todo away with all- forms of intervention, it points out that the Soviet. Government mustbe recognised diplomatically, and a definite agreement must be reached with it. A similar,attitude is taken up by the &quot;Socialist.&quot; The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; calls for themeeting of a special Trade Union Congress in accordance with the Glasgow resolution,.andin view of its opinion that the Russian Revolution has&apos; never been in so critical a positionas now, calls for immediate action. Miss Sylvia Pankhurst in this paper calls uponthe rank and file of the trade union movement to take action themselves, and insists that only the general strike and the sabotage of munitions can save the Soviet Government.Mr. Bullitfs evidence before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations again receivesattention in the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; while, on the other hand, &quot;Rob Roy&quot; in&quot; Forward,&quot; uses Mr. Duke&apos;s articles in the &quot; Times &quot; to reinforce the evidence containedin Mr. Keeling&apos;s book, and to confirm his doubts about the testimony of Mr. Ransome andMr. Bullitt. The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; draws, from &quot;La Nouvelle Internationale &quot;an account of the Public Health administration of the Soviet Government. In &quot; Justice &quot;and the &quot;Democrat,&quot; M. Issaiev continues his articles on the internal policy of the.Bolshevists.International Labour Conference. -The &quot; British Citizen &quot; described the International Labour Conference as &quot; the saneLabour &apos; Internationale &apos; &quot; and proceeds to describe in detail the agenda of the Conference.It warns its readers not to expect too much from the first conference, but trusts that theresult of it will be that Labour throughout the civilised world will be put upon a surerand better foundation than it has ever been upon before. This paper, too, is confident that one result of the conference will be a better understanding between employers andemployed. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; deals with the conference in a special article. Thedifficulties in the way of the meeting of a full and representative conference in a positionto arrive at binding decisions of importance are dealt with. The &quot; New Statesman &quot;then proceeds to analyse the argument that Labour legislation cannot be pushed beyond acertain point in a given country unless international legislation is called to its aid so asto bring other countries at least within reasonable distance of the national standard oflabour conditions. A certain validity is attributed to this argument, but the &quot; New States-man &quot; insists that there are other considerations which qualify its importance, forexample, &quot; the whole philosophy of the economy of high wages.&quot; Therefore, the &quot;New.Statesman &quot; arrives at the conclusion that we must refuse to treat international regulationas in any way imposing limits upon national regulation, but that when the domesticposition has been fully safeguarded, it is highly desirable to press on international regula-tion to the fullest possible extent with a view to the establishment of a minimum standardof civilised life. This paper also warns its readers that they must not be surprised if theimmediate results of the conference are meagre and if our experience of it makes necessary a much more modest valuation of the possibilities of international labour regulation&quot; than has been prevalent in certain quarters.&quot;(B) Home Affairs.The Prime Ministers Sheffield Speeches and the Re-Assembling of Parliament.The Prime Ministers speeches at Sheffield on the 23rd and 24th inst. are connected with, articles on the re-assembly of Parliament and the Labour attitudetowards Government policy. In a leading article, the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; expressesthe opinion that the Sheffield speeches gave no promise that the Prime Ministerappreciated the seriousness of the national situation, or has any plans for dealingwith it. This paper thinks that the Prime Minister hopes to be able to turnpublic interest away from his own misdeeds by uniting the vested interests in a defence oftheir possessions. The Labour Party, therefore, in the opinion of the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;has the opportunity of its life and must use now its gifts of statesmanship. The nextfew months, thinks the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; will decide the contest between the IndependentLiberals and the Labour Party for the right to be considered as the effective opposition and the alternative to the present Government. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald devotes hisweekly article in &quot; Forward &quot; to the consideration of the Sheffield speeches. He thinksthey must have deprived everyone of confidence in the Government. He discusses in detail the Prime Ministers utterances with regard to production. Mr. Macdonald recognises that the first national need is increased production, but insists that mere production itselfdoes not do much. &quot; Production must be directed to the most economical points, or elseit may aggravate rather than ease the situation.&quot;  Men, he thinks, must be moved once
more by the conviction that he who does not work honestly should not eat adequately.With regard to the Prime Ministers speech on Government economy, Mr. Macdonaldmaintains that the reference of the matter to the House of Commons was a subterfugeand insists that it is not the duty of the House of Commons to produce a scheme of economy,but of the Government, and that the House of Commons must take a firm stand upon itscritical functions and not shift its ground.  He hopes that the Labour Party will urge uponthe Government the need for conscription of capital.  In &quot;The Call&quot; Mr. W. A. Wattsdevotes special attention to the Prime Ministers announcement that the bread subsidyis shortly to be removed, and then proceeds to discuss the causes which account for thepresent position.   He argues that they may be summed up in the fact that supplies,production and control are all in the hands of the capitalist class, and because of thisdecides that all measures short of the abolition of capitalism will fail to remedy high prices.As temporary measures, however, the establishment of open-air markets is urged, andthe putting into operation of the clause of the Profiteering Act which permits municipalitiesto enter into trade.  Mr. A. M. Thompson in the &quot; Clarion &quot; arrives at the same con-clusion as Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot;Forward&quot; and refers to the Prime Ministers&quot; confused economics.&quot;  He claims that the Prime Minister confused the economic rewarddue to capital with economic reward due to management, and avers that if the essential difference between usury and the rent of ability were invariably remembered, half thequarrels between Capital and Labour would automatically disappear.   In &quot; Justice&quot;a complaint is made that the Prime Ministers speeches were little beyond series of vagueplatitudes without any serious attempt to apply the principles supposed to underlie themto the problems of the day.   &quot; Justice &quot; voices a demand for practical suggestions, andproceeds to refer to the Caxton Hall speech on agricultural policy and expresses the desire for the continued existence of the Food Production Department of the Board of Agri-culture.   The &quot; Democrat,&quot; as is usual, confines itself to an insistence upon the need for production without making any enquiries as to distribution.  The &quot; New Age &quot; sharesthe belief that the Prime Ministers economic theories are fallacious, but while othercritics accept the Prime Minister^ basic propositions and criticise rather the kind of deduc-tion he makes from them, the &quot; New Age &quot; maintains that those basic principles them-selves are wrong.  This paper then proceeds to recapitulate its arguments against super-production.   The &quot; Daily News &quot; criticism of the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; statistics is endorsedand the &quot; New Age &quot; fears a further agitation on the part of Labour for increased wagesand a further series of strikes, the only escape from which, it is thought, would be a con-centration by both Labour and Capitalists upon the problem of the control of prices.The particular topic, however, which is most discussed in these papers is not increased production or Government economy, but the proposal to increase the public revenue bysome form of taxation of capital. Mr. Theodore Kent, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; maintainsthat the alternatives are a levy. on capital or revolution. In this paper, also, Sir LeoChiozza Money calls for conscription of war profits. He recognises that a special levy on war fortunes is by no means a substitute for a general capital levy, but suggests thatthe latter policy has a greater chance of being adopted. In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. RobertBlatchford develops the hint contained in Mr. Thompson^ criticism of the Prime Ministerfor confusing the economic functions of capital and management, and calls for a fullsocialisation of capital. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is somewhat perturbed by the agitationfor the taxation of war profits, and maintains that the term &quot; war profits &quot; is a falsecategory and the distinction which it implies is economically indefensible, and the phrase itself a mere appeal to inconsiderate prejudice. This paper maintains that theonly class which would benefit as a whole by the substitution of a tax upon war profitsfor a capital levy is that of the &quot; functionless rentier.&apos;&quot; In the present financial situation the &quot; New Statesman &quot; judges that sound finance demands the making of a wider levy on all the accumulated wealth of the country. The &quot; New Age &quot; maintains that theadvantages to be derived from the capital levy are illusory, and that a capital levyto-day would have no real effect, but would leave the proportions of the nationaldistribution much as they are. In preference to this proposal, which it attributes to aGerman origin, the &quot; New Age &quot; puts forward a proposal for the division of the debtequally among the whole of the population. It is not the amount of the debt, but itsdistribution which, in the opinion of this paper, is the essential complaint against it. Ina leading article, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; discusses the financial position of the country,and suggests that the only remedy is the resignation of office by the Prime Minister.A National Industrial Conference and Labour &quot; General Staff.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;These two topics, involving as they each do something of a reorganisation of theLabour movement, are connected together in the discussions in this week&apos;s Labour press.
The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; refers favourably to the original Industrial Conference,and would appear to regret the difficulties that are now arising with the Trade union representatives. The Trade Union representatives are, however, supported in their determination that the National Industrial Council shall not be a &quot; mere paper council.&quot;Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; definitely regards the decision not to includeagriculture in the Forty-Eight Hour Bill as a breach of pledge, and suggests that ifc istime that the trade unions informed the Prime Minister that they trust him no longer.The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; thinks that the deadlock arises out of a definite &quot; anti-Labour and profiteer policy &quot; on the part of the Government, to which the Labour move-ment can show nothing but uncompromising opposition. With regard to the formationof the Labour &quot; General Staff,&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; gives itevery support, and criticises the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congressfor being so constituted that it does not function. Mr. Joseph King, in the &quot; Worker,&quot;uses the metaphors of the class war in order to show the necessity for a Labour &quot; GeneralStaff.&quot; In the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen,&quot; however, the opinion is expressed that theLabour movement to-day does not need increased machinery of the &quot; buffer &quot; type,whether it takes the form of a National Industrial Council or a &quot; general staff &quot; upon thelines of the Mediating Committee, but requires a definite and healthy declaration for economic revolution. &quot; The time for mediation and palliatives has passed. We mustlaunch and carry our own programme.&quot;The Railway Strike and Mines Nationalisation.Mr. John Maclean contributes an article to &quot; The Call&quot; upon the &quot;miners&apos; nextmovement.&quot; He begins by congratulating the B.S.P. upon the influence they have uponthe policy of the working class and emphasises, therefore, the responsibility of the B.S.P.for the revision of labour policy as a result of the railway strike. He attributes to theGovernment the intention to employ the winter in defeating the labour movement athome, while they reserve the summer to defeat it in Eussia, and a great part of this wintercampaign in England he thinks will be devoted to destroying the Miners&apos; Federation.In &quot;Justice &quot; the facts of the railway strike are analysed and the conclusion is arrived atthat the public have been definitely misled as to the course of events. The opinion is expressed that the men were deliberately provoked into striking and that the aim in thusprovoking the strike was to rush a conflict on a section of the working class in order to defeat and demoralise a large trade union, and impose terms which would form a precedent for a low status for general labour. The railway strike, however, is believed to be but apart of a campaign run by a militant section of the upper classes, which, in order to reducelabour to its pre-war level, intends to force a series of limited strikes so that labour maybe defeated in detail. The strike settlement, however, is regarded as a sharp defeat ofthese tactics, but a fear is expressed that a new attempt may be made. The editor of&apos;&quot; Justice,&quot; however, expresses his disagreement with these conclusions and his opinionthat the greater the pressure brought upon the railwaymen to strike, the greater wasthe need for them not to strike. The &quot; Democrat&quot; contains an article in which theopinion is expressed that the railway strike has proved that the adoption of nationalisationin any essential industry does not in any way guarantee the freedom of that industry from labour troubles, nor lessen the intensity of these troubles when they appear. Atthe same time it is thought that Nationalisation will prove to be prejudicial to the tradeunions and to their members, and with regard to railways in particular, preference is expressed for the old system of separate companies under which local and limited railwaystrikes were possible and legitimate. In conclusion, it is suggested that the worker who wishes to retain and use the strike weapon must be somewhat shy of nationalisationschemes.Other.The Rusholme by-election result is discussed by Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; labour leader.&quot; He regards it as a proof of the wisdom of the I.L.P. decision to allow no by-election to pass uncontested. The actual figures of the voting he considers as a proof thatthe Prime Minister has no moral authority behind him. Dr. Dunstan&apos;s success also showsto Mr. Snowden the value of the I.L.P. element to the Labour Party. He thinks thatno ordinary trade union secretary would have succeeded in Manchester half so well asDr. Dunstan. The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that the result of the elections shows that a labour government is more or less of a certainty in the near future provided that the Party sheds&quot; its cranks and wild men.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; concludes that the Liberal Party,if it is to survive in any recognisable form, must go right or left. As a mere critical body,this paper thinks it is doomed because of the deep-rooted tendency in this country to
revert to a two party system. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; concludes that the result of theelection shows that there is no desire on the part of the electors of the constituency to get, rid of the present Government.-A communication from the Labour News Service appears in the majority of thelabour weekly papers condemning the alleged attempt of the Government to control thepress through publicity bureaux.  A special reference is made to the allegations in the daily Herald &quot; from the 16th to the 20th inst., with regard to a bureau named &quot; Indus-trial Information.&quot;  The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; has a paragraph probably from&apos; the same source criticising the activities of Sir Basil Thomson&apos;s department. Theproposed formation of Citizen Guards is referred to unfavourably in &quot;The Call&quot; andr&apos; the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot; They are taken to mean the formation of so-called&quot;White Guards,&quot; and the question is asked whether the workers will ever realise thefutility of opposing force by resolutions, and the formation of a &quot; Workers&apos; Guard &quot; is&apos; suggested. With regard to the extension of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act the&quot; New Statesman &quot; suggests that the only wise course is to continue the Act in its present form so as to afford time for permanent rates of wages to be adjusted before the periodof regulation comes to an end.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.   -The &quot; Ex-Service Man &quot; discusses this week the decision of the A.S.E. to refuse&apos;toco-operate with the Government in putting into operation the scheme for training disabled soldiers and sailors.  This action is attributed to the influence of those quarters &quot; which: seem intent;on blocking anything constructive or likely to be of national gain,&quot; and the. hope is expressed that individual members of the union will see the cruelty of their decisioni and will rescind it.. i (3) Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.- - &quot;-. - .  Nil. &apos;   &apos;Part IV.-General Topics.The General Situation.The general situation is quiet on the surface, but it is quiet only because below the surface so many important issues are under discussion. Any one of these, if a false stepis made in the process of negotiation, may lead to industrial trouble of a serious land.A mere enumeration of the matters which are at present being deliberated on is sufficient&quot;to indicate the general gravity of the situation. The question of the formation of theNational Industrial Council and the closely related matter of the future of the 48-Hourand Minimum Wage Bills ; the problem of the stabilisation and consolidation of wages,and in this connection the future of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act; the matters before the International Labour Conference at Washington-all these are points whichvitally concern Labour as a whole. In addition, various sectional, but still exceedinglyimportant, matters are being negotiated on. The railwaymen continue their negotiationswith the Government on the control of the railways and the standardisation of rates of pay, the miners are conducting a great campaign of propaganda in favour of nationalisation,about forty unions in the engineering, shipbuilding and other trades have made applicationto the Court of Arbitration for an increase of los. per week, a national wage claim for anincrease of 4d. per hour in the building trade has just been partially settled by the NationalConciliation Board, and in other trades too numerous to mention various demands arebeing made and discussed. It is perhaps remarkable that, in view of the mass of dis-content that such an enumeration reveals, there are so few actual strikes. The only largestrike at the moment is the Ironfounders. One reason certainly is that in the last threemonths strikes have not on the whole proved very effective weapons, and there is a growingtendency, accentuated since the railway strike, for Labour to seek to obtain its ends bybargaining rather than by striking.Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act.After consultation with the representatives of the employers and trade unions, adraft Bill has been prepared to provide for the extension of the Wages (Temporary Regula-tion) A.ct, arid this will be submitted to representatives of the trade unions and employersat the end of the week.
Nationalisation.The miners&apos; campaign for the nationalisation of the mines was officially opened at manchester on Sunday, the 26th inst., when Mr. Frank Hodges spoke at a great demon-stration in the Free Trade Hall. Mr. Smillie Was also to have taken part, but owing toillness he was unable to do so. It was suggested in this Eeport a fortnight ago (p. 328)that the note that would be stressed by the leaders of the M.F.G.B. in their campaignwould be the advantage likely to accrue to the whole community as consumers of coal ifthe mines AVere nationalised. At the demonstration in Manchester this Was the main point emphasised by Mr. Hodges. In this connection he maintained that the 6s. increase,in ihe price of coal was unnecessary, and insisted that if the people of the country Wereshort of coal this winter, they must blame the system which made productivity at itshighest level impossible. The same general standpoint was also adopted by Mr. Hodgesin his speech to the Liverpool Chamber-of. Commerce on the 27th inst. There he main-tained that nationalisation would result in an increase in production and a decrease in thecost of production, and would thus benefit the community as a whole. The underlyingargument which Mr. Hodges uses in this appeal to the community involves a psychologicalanalysis of the mind of the miner. He suggests that if the mines are nationalised, andthe miner becomes master of the industry in which he is engaged, he will automaticallyre-orientate himself to the community, and desire to serve it with all his might, recognising that the community of which he forms a part has a right to demand from him the fullestservice which he can render. Such an attitude has, of course, been advocated by socialphilosophers for generations; and it seems a little doubtful if such a sudden and wholesaleconversion would be brought about by mere Act of Parliament.But the nrners&apos; leaders are aware that this ideal does not animate the breasts of ailtheir followers, and the campaign which has just begun is also intended to be a campaign of education. It is desired to educate the miners in the necessity of nationalisation,and to inspire them with the belief in the &quot; change of heart &quot; that they will be expectedto show if and when nationalisation takes place. At present the miners&apos; leaders appearto be somewhat doubtful how far the rank and file will go in support of the principle of nationalisation. There is, however, no doubt that the Lancashire miners as a whole are strongly in favour of it, and that may be one reason, why Mr. Smillie and Mr. Hodges decidedto start their campaign in Lancashire, in order that it might have the most enthusiasticpossible send-off.It is understood that the executive of the M.F.G.B. will meet the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress on the 5th November, to discuss the questionof calling a special Trades Union Congress to consider the situation arising from theGovernment^ attitude to the nationalisation of the mines. With reference to this, it is interesting to note that Mr. Smillie stated at the special delegate conference of the M.F.G.B.on the 23rd inst. that this Congress would consider whether the miners&apos; educationalpropaganda in favour of nationalisation should continue for a period, or the Trade union movement should bring pressure to beai on the Government by industrial action.Miners and the Cost of Living.The special delegate conference of the M.F.G.B., at its meeting on the 23rd inst.,devoted its attention almost exclusively to the question of the cost of living. Thefollowing resolution was unanimously carried : &quot; That this conference is of opinionthat the present method of dealing with the cost of living by the Government has not succeeded in reducing prices to the community. On the contrary, prices are tendingupwards, with consequent distress to the working classes. In view of this the conferenceurges the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to arrange that atthe special Trades Union Congress which is to be called, an opportunity shall be providedfor the Labour movement to decide upon a policy which has for its object the reductionof the cost of living.&quot;Mr. Frank Hodges, speaking to this resolution, said that in his opinion the Govern-ment had entirely failed to reduce the level of prices, and therefore he thought that theyhad to see whether the working classes could provide some sort of solution. At thepresent time they were in a vicious circle and their wages travelled after prices. Somehowthey had to break through that circle, and only in doing so could they have a schemewhich would affect the problem of production as well as prices. He pointed out thatthe1 mere taxation of excess profits was no solution. The only way in which prices couldbe affected in this matter was to divert excess profits to the actual reduction in pricesinstead of allowing them to go into the Exchequer and to become part of the national income. He urged the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to formulate a real scheme which would secure the support of the working-class movement,(C 1908) 3 F
.and such pressure could then be brought to bear on the Government as would make themexpress that scheme in legislative enactments. Mr. George Barker (South Wales)suggested that the Trades Union Congress should give an ultimatum to the Governmentthat if the cost of living were not reduced by 50 per cent, within three months they would cease to produce altogether. He pointed but that production was only one factor whichentered into the question. They might produce as much as they liked, but if theyhanded it over to another person who, in turn, handed it back on his own terms, theyvrould be no better off.  Mr. Smillie also spoke.But the real interest of the meeting lies not so much in what was said, as in why it was considered desirable by the M.F.G.B. to devote a whole day at a special congress to a question which does not concern them peculiarly. It may be suggested that theleaders of the M.F.G.B. had two reasons. In the first place, they are very anxious atthe present moment to exhibit solicitude on behalf of the community as a whole. their general attitude heretofore has been regarded in many quarters as exceedingly selfishand unsocial, and there is much evidence that they are now doing their utmost to &quot; curryfavour &quot; with the general public, in order to &quot; educate &quot; the community to support the nationalisation of the mines. Thus at the conference Mr. Sniillie went out of his way to insist that in initiating a movement for the reduction of the cost of living, they were acting on behalf not of the working class alone, but of the. community as a whole. Inthe second place, the miners are eager not to lose the hegemony of the Trade union movement. In the Triple Alliance, in which the M.F.G.B. was officially merely primusinter pares, there was a strong accent on the primus. Recent circumstances, however,rather threatened to throw them into the background, for the railwaymen, during and since their strike, have made much capital of their contention that they were acting onbehalf of the whole Trade Union movement in trying to secure stabilisation and con-solidation of wages. And the miners are anxious now to stabilise their leadership ofthe Triple Alliance and obtain the ostensible position of guardians of the interests of theworking classes.Russia.A provisional &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee of 12 was formed for London by a delegate meeting held at Chandos Hall on the 26th inst. The Committee represents theI.L.P., B.S.P., &quot; Daily Herald &quot; League, Central Labour College, and various trades union and ex-Service men?s organisations. It has been announced that the first stepof the Committee will be to call a conference of Trade Union, Labour and politicalorganisations to formulate plans for propaganda and action to enforce the demand madeat the Albert Hall on the 11th inst. for the conclusion of peace with the de facto Govern-ment in Russia. It was suggested in this Report a fortnight ago (p. 331) that it mightbe expected that the agitation with regard to the attitude of the Government to russia would gradually grow formal and academic, and the appointment of this committee iscertainly a confirmation of that anticipation, for the leading spirits in it are of the theoreticSocialist rather than the practical trade union variety.International Labour Conference.The Conference was opened on the 29th inst. by Mr. W. B. Wilson, American Secretaryof Labour. Representatives of 31 countries were present. Although the United states was not represented, owing to the refusal of Congress to allow delegates to attend untilthe ratification of the Peace Treaty by the United States, Mr. Wilson invited the AmericanFederation of Labour to appoint Labour delegates, and the United States Chamber ofCommerce to choose representatives of the employers. Baron Meyor des Planches,Italian delegate, proposed a resolution, which was seconded by Canada, inviting theAmerican delegates, when appointed, to attend the Conference. This curious position,in which at a Conference convened by the United States, United States delegates are tobe present only unofficially on the invitation of Italian and Canadian representatives,will, it is understood, be regularised later, when the United States Government will give an ante-dated formalisation to the proceedings of the Conference. The delegates of theCanadian Government are the Hon. Newton W. RoWell, president of the King&apos;s privy council of Canada and acting Secretary of State for External Affairs, and the Hon. GideonD. Robertson, Minister of Labour. The German delegates include Herr August Miilleras a Government delegate, Herr Wieland, employers&apos; delegate, and Herr Grassmann,Vice-President of the General Commission of Trades Unions, workpeople&apos;s delegate. TheGerman-Austrian Cabinet has decided for financial reasons not to take part in the Con-ference. The Dutch delegation includes as Government delegates W. H. Nolens, memberof the Second Chamber of States General and leader of the Roman Catholic Party, and
G. J. Van Thienen ; the Employers&apos; delegate is J. A. E. Verkade, and that of the Workersis J. Oudegeest.Railway men,The negotiations between the Government and the N.U.R. are continuing. Ameeting between the Prime Minister and the executive of the N.U.R. took place last week,and on the 28th the executives of the two Unions met the Minister of Labour, the Ministerof Transport and Government officials. A further meeting with the Prime Minister takes place later in the week. The question of the control of the railways is being discussed aswell as the consolidation of rates of pay.A special delegate meeting of the A.S.L.E. and F. was held in Leeds on the 21st-24thOctober, and a series of demands were formulated. These included a demand that, inorder that the railways should be run for the benefit of the community, including the railwaymen, elected representatives of the men, to be paid by the societies, should begiven a proportion of seats upon the managing committees, both locally and nationally..The following resolutions were also carried  That 14 days&apos; holiday be allowed annually, with full pay, after six months&apos; service,one extra day to be allowed for each Bank Holiday worked. Six free passesto be available annually, to any part of the United Kingdom, for each man,his wife and family.That enginemen, motor men, assistant drivers, firemen and electric train men, whofrom ill-health or defective eyesight, brought about by their employment,,are taken off the footplate (electric or steam) shall be paid not less than therate of pay they were receiving when taken off the footplate.&apos;   It was also decided to take up a definite stand on the question of lodging away from home, and to refuse to undertake journeys which involve this practice.   Itwas agreed that members&apos; contributions should be increased by 2d. per week.The conference also decided to instruct the Executive Committee to put forward a uniform demand for 75. 6d. per week special rent allowance to all members,to be paid in addition to wages..   It is important to note that a series of new proposals has been submitted by theN.U.R. to the A.S.L.E. and F. with the object of securing the fusion of the two bodies.The proposals include :  (1) special representation for locomotive men on the UnionExecutive ; (2) no members of either union to suffer loss of benefits provided by the rules of the respective organisations ; (3) a guarantee to be given to the officials and staffs ofexisting unions, that their position will not be adversely affected by amalgamation.These proposals were discussed at a joint meeting of the executives on the 28th inst.   Aspecial general meeting of the N.U.R. will take place on the 4th and 5th November, toreceive a report on the progress of the negotiations with the Government and the A.S.L.E.and F., and to consider a proposed revision of the rules, the most important provisions ofwhich are that there shall be two secretaries, one industrial and the other parliamentary,and that union subscription shall be raised by 5d. per week, and strike pay to 24s. perweek.Labour Organisation.The first meeting of the sub-committee appointed by the Parliamentary Committeeof the T.U.C. to consider ways and means for co-ordinating Trade Union activity (i.e.,the formation of a so-called General Staff) was held on the 23rd inst. The committeeconsists of Messrs. Gosling, Thorne, SAvales (A.S.E.), J. Hill, Bramley and W. J. Boulton(private secretary). Proposals were considered for constituting a special department under the control of the Parliamentary Committee for dealing with any question arising in industry likely to lead to trade disputes, and the development of a representative centreexercising control of trade union activity, and making preparations for all emergencieslikely to arise out of serious industrial &quot;trouble. The Committee agreed to meet, at alater date, consultative members elected by the Mediation Committee and by the TradeUnion side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the Industrial Conference. The member selected by the Mediation Committee as a result of a postal vote are Messrs. Bevin, .R.Williams, F. Hodges, J. R. Clynes and J. T. Brownlie. Representatives appointed by theProvisional Joint Committee (trade union side) are Messrs. Henderson, Bradshaw (NationalFederation of Building Trades Operatives). Hindle (United Textile Factory Workers&apos;Association), W. F. Purdy (Shipconstructors and Shipwrights&apos; Society) and Mj. G. D. H.Cole. This joint Committee is a remarkably representative and statesmanlike body ofLabour, and its deliberations will be followed with great interest.(C 1908) 3 F2
Hours and Wages Bills.The Parliamentary Labour Party has appointed the following Committee to deal withthe Hours and Wages Bills : A. Henderson, W. J. Davis, T. Griffiths, J. 0&apos;Grady, A.Short, J. R. Clynes, J. E. Davison, J. Jones, W. J. Royce, W. R. Smith and Robert Young.The Seafarers&apos; Joint Council has unanimously passed a resolution to make every effort to get the 48-Hour Bill extended to seamen.British Socialist Party.The declaration of this Party in favour of affiliation with the Third (Moscow) Inter-national has resulted in the resignation of Mr. G. Alexander, the Treasurer, and Mr.Fairchild, the editor of &quot; The Call,&quot; the official organ of the Party.Ex-Service Men.Ex-Service Metis Organisations-It is reported that the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;union, an association with extremist views, is now practically defunct. Its leaders arenow attempting to save it from dissolution by proposing to amalgamate with the Inter-national Union of ex-Service men, a small but vigorous Glasgow organisation.Comrades of the Great War. This society has now 1,800 units established, includingbranches in South Africa, West Africa and South America.Amalgamation.A special delegate meeting of the A.U.C.E. was held at Leeds on the 12th october to consider the report of the Executive Council on the question of the amalgamation ofthe Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees, the National Amalgamated Unionof Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks and the National Warehouse and general works&apos; Union.   See also under &quot; Railway men,&quot; p. 373.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners. In the monthlyjournal of this society, a warning is issued to members to refuse to handle prepared joinerysuch as doors, sashes and frames unless they are convinced that it was made under tradeunion conditions of employment and by trade union labour. It is pointed out that unlessmembers do their part to prevent the development of non-Unionism, the efforts of theUnions to maintain fair conditions in this trade will be undermined. It also impressesupon all members the necessity of taking full advantage of the Restoration of Pre-WarPractices Act.Agricultural Labourers&apos; and Rural Workers&apos; Union. In the &quot; Land Worker,&quot; theofficial organ of this Union, the General Secretary of the Scottish Farm Servants Union,Mr. J. F. Duncan, insists that it is essential that agricultural labourers should persist intheir opposition to the exclusion of agricultural labourers from the 48-Hour Bill on theground that &quot; this is the first piece of social legislation since the war.&quot; If farm workers are excluded from this Bill, that will be taken, he maintains, as a guide for the future,and farm workers will always be left out. Hence the necessity for agricultural labourers ,to claim equality of treatment with other workers by insisting on their inclusion in the48-Hour Bill.Part V. Departmental and District Reports.(1) Departmental Reports.Training Grants Scheme.The Grants Committee have received from the District Selective Committees 10,289applications for training, of which 6,889 have so far been sanctioned.Appointments.During the week ending the 17th October, 1,116 candidates were available for appoint-ments.

A deputation from the Amalgamated Weavers&apos;Association was interviewed by Sir David Shackleton, in connection with the levelling up,in accordance with the Uniform List, of the price list of mills in outlying districts. after discussion it was decided that this end might best be attained by the unions making a claim for a substituted rate in each district where they are organised, such rate to be that of theUniform List.Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association. Discussion was held on the 24th October withrepresentatives of this Association as to the dispute in progress at the Mill Close LeadMines, Matlock, arising from the discharge of men on the ground that the ore is givingout. The Association contend that the restoration of the pre-war four-shift system would absorb the men discharged. It was explained that the case did not come withinthe Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act. The Association accepted this explanation,and continued efforts are to be made to bring the parties together.Joint Industrial Councils Division.Baking (Scottish). At a meeting of the Council on the 23rd October, discussion tookplace of items on the national programme, other than claims for wages and holidayswhich the Operative Bakers&apos; Union have decided to refer to arbitration. A deadlock wasreached on the question of starting time. A further meeting is to be held on the29th October.Cable-making. At a meeting of the Council on the 23rd October a sub-committeewas appointed to consider the establishment of District Councils, and it was resolvedtliat, pending the appointment of these Councils, the joint conference of the Cable Makers&apos;Association and certain trade unions which is already in existence, should be strengthened by the inclusion of representatives from the Electrical Trades Union and the NationalFederation of Women Workers, and two further representatives of employers. Thisenlarged conference is to deal, for the present, with questions of wages, hours and working conditions. .Tramways. At a meeting of the Council, held on the 22nd October, it was decidedthat the draft constitution of Works Committees should be&apos; finally referred to a small number of selected representatives, and that a definite agreement as to the constitutionof these committees should be reached by the 15th January, 1920.
(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment.-The live register for the week ending the 10th October shows atotal increase of 13,924 on the total for the week ending the 19th September,-the last week for which normal returns were made. This represents an increase of 10,486 in men and3,438 in women. The increase is attributed partly to the railway strike and partly to theironmoulders&apos; strike, but in many cases it is caused by the speeding up of demobilisation,e.g., at Stepney, although the number of the Civilian Register is only 252, the numberson the Live Register of the Exchange increased during the week ending the 26th Sep-tember from 2,678 to 3,672. The analysis of the figures of the six Exchanges at whichunemployment is most serious reveal the following occupations as chiefly affected : Building, general labouring, engineering, conveyance of men and goods and commercialamong men, and domestic among women.Out-of-Work Donation.-Dartford and Rochester Local Employment Committeesprotest against the withholding of the Emergency Donation from ironfounders&apos; labourers,while no similar disqualification applies to engineers and engineers&apos; labourers thrown outof work by the ironfounders&apos; strike.Employment of ex-Service Men. From Stepney it is reported that only 26 under-takings have been received, although appeals with reference to the National Scheme were sent to 811 local employers and advertisements inserted in the local press.Training. Walham Green Employment Committee report that a large number ofwomen are awaiting training. They ask for the provision of additional training centres.Ilford Employment Committee urges the immediate necessity for opening classes in thearea for dressmaking and millinery, as applicants are waiting for admission. Arrange--ments for a local training centre are now complete at Dartford.Domestic Service, Special success in placing applicants in domestic service is reported from Penge, Acton and several other Exchanges, and there can be little doubt that domesticvacancies are being more readily accepted. Sutton Women&apos;s Sub-Committee recommends that the scheme of co-operation between Employment Exchanges and private registryoffices be not proceeded with, as it gives the impression that registry offices are more effective than the Exchanges.Interrupted Apprenticeships. -At a meeting of the Deptford and Greenwich Employ-ment Committee it was reported that many apprentices were on the books whom it was.impossible to place as apprentices in employment, some firms having refused to takeback their pre-war apprentices, and in some cases the wages offered being too small forthe applicant to accept. The fear was expressed that the work of the Committee wouldbe a failure unless the employers offered better terms.Motor-Car Production. The Whitehead Aviation Works, Kingston, are shortly to be adapted to the manufacture of motor cars, and between 3,000 and 4,000 workers wiltprobably be required.South Blidlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 10th October shows ageneral increase of. 5,226 on the totals rendered for the week ending the 19th September.The male register shows an increase of 4,729 and women an increase of 497. This increase is largely due to the railway strike, accentuated in some cases by the strike of ironfounders..Seven Committee areas register decreases, the highest at LoWestoft (128) being due to thebeginning of the fishing season and the absorption of labour in the factories for packingwork,Shortage of Labour.-The demand for skilled labour at Ipswich is reported to be greater than the supply, especially in the building trade.Employment of Ex-Service Men. 180 undertakings given by firms in respect of the-National Scheme have been accepted by employment committees. 140 undertakingsawait consideration.Domestic Service. The Watford Employment Committee expressed the opinion thatif the scheme of co-operation between Employment Exchanges and private registry offices,were adopted, there Was a likelihood of employers resorting to registry offices rather than to Exchanges, and that better work could be done if existing arrangements continued.
Chemical Works. The British Chemical Works, Ltd., are opening at Watford a new factory which will provide employment for a considerable number of girls. The WatfordEmployment Committee are enquiring into the question of the wages to be paid at this factory, and decided in the meantime to defer consideration of training the girlsrequired, although the majority for whom employment could be found would require-preliminary training.Difficulties Resulting from, Application of Minimum Wage. It was reported to theNorthampton Employment Committee that a number of the boot operatives on the live register were aged workpeople, not qualified to work at the minimum Wage, and thatgreat difficulty was experienced in placing such people, owing to the reluctance of localfirms to employ workers in the possession of a &quot; permit &quot; to Work at less than the standard rate.South-Western.Unemployment. In comparison with the totals rendered for the week ending the26th September, the live register for the week ending the 17th October shows a total increase of 5,117, representing an increase of 4,849 in men and 268 in women. Bristol,Cheltenham, Gloucester, Swindon, Plymouth, Southampton and Portsmouth show thegreatest percentages of unemployment, the occupations chiefly affected being building,engineering, conveyance, commercial, shipbuilding and general labouring among menand domestic and commercial among women.Dockyard Discharges. Over 200 notices have been served on workers in DevonportDockyard, and it is understood that about 1,500 will be discharged during the next threemonths. At Portsmouth Dockyard 95 men, principally skilled labourers, have receiveda fortnights notice, and further notices are expected to be issued Weekly. The Ports-mouth Committee of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades suggest thatthe Government should build and own a fleet of merchant ships, troop ships and oil tankvessels, with a view to retaining present employees in the Dockyard and providing employ-ment for men who will be demobilised from the Royal Navy.Employment of Ex-Service Men. -It is reported that there has been a poor response from employers in this Division to the National Scheme. Personal canvassing is beingvigorously carried out, and the results, though not large, show an appreciable differencefrom those obtained from circulation of letters alone. Eleven undertakings have beenreceived at Bournemouth. Cowes Employment Committee have declined to take any action in support of the scheme. Swindon Town Council have given an assurance thatthey will adopt the Scheme, and that they will, if possible, exceed the 5 per cent, quota.Training. On application from the Portsmouth Engineering L.A.C., H.M. Dockyard,Portsmouth, have agreed to train 30 disabled men.West Midlands.Unemploijment. In comparison with the unemployment returns for the week ending the 19th September, the Live Register for the week ending the 10th October, shows a generaldecrease of 1,339, representing an increase of 25 men and a decrease of 1,364 women.The total number of persons registered as unemployed throughout the division now reachesthe total of 45,530, or 1*27 per cent, of the sugar buying population Coventry (430),Newcastle (316), Wolverhampton (459) show the principal increases. The heaviest&apos; decreases are at Birmingham (1,483), Wednesbury (366), and Cradley Heath (199).Ironfounders&apos;&apos; Strike. The effects of the ironfounders&apos; strike are more marked each week, particularly in the establishments where the heavier castings are used. suspension of workmen and short time are becoming more extended, and in the electrical industry,sections of men are working only alternate weeks. At Rugby the men employed in other branches of the engineering trade are making a voluntary levy in support of the ironfounders,but this is not common and the officials of the society are appealing for funds. Unemploy-ment in the engineering trade at Coventry has increased by 376. Other areas similarlyaffected are Walsall, Wolverhampton and Smethwick. Eight leading firms in the Midlandsproved to the recent Short-Time Tribunal that they were doing their best to carry on by working short time ; but for such reorganisation some 5,000 workers would be idle.Training The Dudley Employment Committee are endeavouring to formulate somepractical scheme for the training of local disabled ex-service men in the vacant NationalProjectile Factory.
Domestic Service&apos;. It was decided at Dudley that publicity should be given throughthe medium of the local press to the advisability of persons registering at the employment exchange for domestic work and also to the facilities offered under the new scheme ofco-operation between the Exchanges and the private registry offices.Trade Board for the Brass Trade. In view of the large amount of unemployment among women in the brass trade, the Birmingham Employment Committee urges theimperative necessity of the immediate establishment of the proposed Trade Board.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. In comparison with the totals rendered for the week ending the 19thSeptember, the unemployment figures for the Week ending the 10th October show ageneral increase of 11,290, consisting of an increase of 10,057 men and 1,233 women. It isanticipated that this Week will show an increase on account of the ironfounders&apos; strike.The shortage of water supplies in several areas is now becoming a serious matter,necessitating the working of short time.Impediments to Production. Important factors impeding production at the- presenttime are : (1) shortage of raw materials, (2) shortage of housing, (3) shortage of brick-layers, (4) shortage of coal and (5) the retention of skilled men with the Forces.Employment of Ex-Service Men. Bradford Employment Committee reports thatthe Bradford Dyers&apos; Association have signed an undertaking to participate in the national scheme for the employment of Disabled ex-Service Men.Brocklesby Gamp. Lincolnshire Ironmasters&apos; Association are now hopeful of taking over Brocklesby Camp, which can house 800-1,000 workpeople. It is, therefore, antici-pated that the iron and steel industry at Frodingham and Scunthorpe will be able toincrease production.Sheffield Cutlery Trades. The feature of the week is the maturing of the much-talked-of trade combination to specialise in production, reduce labour wastage in duplicatehandling of materials during processes, &amp;c, and modernise factories. Five firms Messrs.J. Elliott &amp; Sons, Loekwood Bros., Needham, Veal &amp; Tyzack, Southern &amp; Richardson,and Thomas Turner &amp; Co. are combining. Although at present maintaining separatetrade identity and fully representing all sides of cutlery, razor and scissor trades, theywill immediately specialise and make a combination larger than the premier firm of J.Rodgers &amp; Co. The chief spirit is probably Aid. A. J. Hobson, J.P., the well-knownleader of Sheffield&apos;s Chamber of Commerce. It is probable that other combinations will follow in the near future.General. It is reported that the textile mills are very busy, the engineering trade isWell supplied with orders and the clothing trade is in a flourishing condition.Northern.Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 10th October shows anincrease in the totals rendered for the week ending the 19th September of 4,879, repre-senting an increase of 5,043 in men and a decrease of 164 in women. There is an increaseof unemployment in almost every area,.the most serious increases being at the Hartlepools,Jarrow, Middlesbrough, North Shields and Workington.Ironfounders&quot; Strike-The ironfounders&apos; strike is the main retarding factor in the division, most of the engineering establishments being seriously affected and quite anumber completely closed down.Shortage of Material-Messrs.
