Government 15HOURS OF JfldPLOYffiJHT BILL (No. 2t )        &apos;,.&apos;&quot;  Memorandum &quot;by, the president of tho Board of /Agriculture&apos;.and Fisheries,1. The Memcoraridum &quot;by the Secretary for - Scotland &apos;.(C .P. C7.; , datedthe 31st ultimo, raises a&apos;Question of grave ;ijs^nrti^noe to agriculture.     On July 4th last (W. 0.588 Minuie&apos;6,&apos;.,)&apos; the WarCabinet definitely decided to exclude Agriculture&apos; frcm the Hours tfEmployment.-J3ill, the Prime Minister stating that the Cabinet &quot;were unanimously against the inclusion of Agriculture&quot;.     The Seoretaryfor Scotland, who was present on that occasion, &quot;agreed with Lordlh?nle and said that so far as agriculture was concerned the Bill whjp^quite     unworkable,n     Until the Msmo-randum of the 31at ultimo was circulated, I was under the impression-that the Ministers in charge(if the three Agricultural Departments oordiallj&quot; eujrp^Tted the considered decision of the Government,. ........I do.not know what has led the Secretary;.for Scotland to change his.views, so suddenly and unexpectedly, but he refers withsome apprehension to the possibly &quot;hostile votes of the farmlabourer and his wife at the next election&quot;,     I trust that one ofthe gravest questions with which&apos;agriculture 1b confronted at thepresent time is not going to be decided by electioneeringconsiderations.-2, The decision of the Government to exclude Agriculture from theBill was officially&apos;announced by the Minister of Labour on the21st ultimo, when in reply to a deputation from the Trade union representatives on the Provisional Joint Committee of the national industrial Conference&apos;, he said &quot;Agriculture had been excluded bydecision of the vVar Cabinet and he was unable to offer any hopethat this decision would be modified.&quot;3, Tnere is no question with regard to which farmers feel sostrongly at the present moment, and in pursuance of the-generalpolicy announced by the Prime Minister in his speech on the 21stultimo , I have taken every opportunity of reassuring them on thispoint, and of stating that the decision of the Government wasdeliberate and final,,       am convinced that any change cf frontnow would be disastrous in its effects on the farming community,and that nothing could do more to destroy the feeling of confidence in the intentions of the Government with regard to Agriculture,which the Prime Minister1s speech did so much to promote,4, I agree with the Secretary for Scotland ae to thedesirability of ensuring that the agricultural labourer shall sharewith workers in other industries the opportunities for &quot;social andrecreative life&quot; which improved conditions of labour afford, butI consider that this end may be best secured by means   other thanstatutory enactment, and is, in point of fact, already ^eingseoured by the action of the Agricultural Wages Board.     I furthersubmit that the exclusion of Agriculture is a &quot;matter of principle&quot;the principle being that farming differs so essentially from industrial occupations that a rigid statutory enactment cannotprovide the necessary elasticity for adapting the hours of workto the varying conditions cf season,- district and individual work.5, The Secretary for Scotland refers to act ion which, he Btates,has been taken in-Germany and Italy,     The new code dealing with
farm labour issued by tho Gorman Government on tho 29th January last,appears to be based on the principlos adopted by the agricultural wages Board in this country., viz; fixing a number oi hours per weekafter which overtime is payable, subject to the proviso, in the German Code, that ;fin estimating payment for overtimethe time occupied in baiting and looking after cattle must be reckoned as overtime unless it be the local custom to include this work in the contract of service *&quot;   I^wculoT appear &quot;*&quot;t her e for e&quot;&quot;$Ikfi t the &quot;&quot;Hours&quot; ofwork, a&apos;F&quot; h&quot;e ordinary rate of wages, may, and probably would, exceed the statutory limits in the case of horsemen, stockmen and shepherds.But .1 would point out that the hours&apos; fixed in the German code are 8hours per day for 4 months, 10 hours for 4 months, and 11 hours for  months - making an average of 58 hours -per week for the whole year.In this Country, under the Orders of the Agricultural Wages Board, theaverage working week for which payment at ordinary rates to be made,is 491/^ hours, i,e., 34 weeks at 50 hours and. 18 weeks at 48 hourscIt does not appear, therefore, that the English farm labourer would bebetter off by the adoption of the German system of regulating hours,,I was not aware that an eight-hour day for agriculture had been adoptedin Italy, and the fact is not mentioned in the Reoort of the organising committee of tho International Labour Conference, which mentions anumber of Industries (not including agriculture), in which there areagreements, local or national, limiting hours to 48 per week or 8 per day.The Secretary for Scotland states that in several Scottishcounties agreements have been reached between farmers and labourers asto the number of hours to be worked in each season, and also as to thecircumstances in which overtime may be demanded.   Similar agreements,varying in their terms, have been reached in some counties in England,while in the Orders of the Agricultural Wages Board relating to certain areas, special hours are arranged for different classes of workers.Such agreements are obviously desirable, but if agriculture were included in the hours of Employment Bill, they would be illegal unlessthe cumbrous procedure provided in Clause II of obtaining Ordersembodying them were gone through-   It is even doubtful whether, as theBill nov/ stands, many of these agreements could be brought withinthe scope cf such Orders.The specific recommendation made by the Secretary for scotland is that the statutory limitation of hours should be based on a workingyear instead of a working week, with power to District WagesCommittees to adjust the distribution of hours, within tho maximum,-for different seasons.   Under this scheme unlimited overtime couldapparently be allowed at the discretion of a District committee Itis further suggested that overtime should be made compulsory atseed time and harvest, which presumably means that the employer cancompel the worker, under penalty, to work any amoimt of overtime hemay demand at such seasons.   Such a provision would obviously be contrary to the fundamental principle of the Bill, and would bebitterly ooposed by Trade Unions.     I would also . point out that ascheme which is based upon tho Scottish system of yearly hirings ofAgricultural Labour would be quite inapplicable to The&quot;&quot;systom of weekly en^a^onnnts which largely prevails in England *h November, 1919.1 of Fo
