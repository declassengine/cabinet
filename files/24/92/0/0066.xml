She towed off the boat which has beenbeached and cruised in the neighbourhood to protect theboats which intended to continue fishing.On the buyers raising the price of fish the strikecame to an end and boats have now resumed fishing0Devonport.There are two proposals at present under considera-tion that will considerably affect the development ofPlymouth as a Commercial Port if adoptecU(l) A joint central, station for the Great Western and london and South Western Railways at St. Budeaux, whichwould considerably improve the railway transport facilities of the port by obviating the shunting now necessary betweenSt cBu&amp;eaux and North Road, and by providing an alternativeline to H.M* Dockyardo(2)&apos; The sale of the North Yard at Devonport Dockyardfor commercial purposes.    This proposal has been putforward to the Admiralty by the Plymouth Corporation.     Inview of the present congestion at London, Liverpool, Hull3and the Clyde i% is believed It will meet with general approval and receive the support of the shipping communitythroughout the countryaIt will be seen that these two proposals      will be of mutual benefit to each other if they materialise0pLTY,, S6W,lorfch November, 1919*
