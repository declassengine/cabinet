P. A. HANKEY.2 Whitehall Gardens. S.W*14th November,,mA SALUTE TO THE FSAD.Memorandum by Sir Per cy Fit spatrick.In the hearts of our people there is a real desireto find some&apos;lasting expression of their feeling for thosewho gave their lives in the War.   They want something donenow nhile memorios of sacrifice are in the minds of all;   fortheao ib tlm-.  re-ail   -   too well grounded in experience  -that those who have gone will not always bo first in thethoughts of all, and that when the fruits of their sacrificebecome our daily bread there will be few occasions to remindub 3f what we realise so clearly today.   Year by year there .will be fewer who will remember.Turing the War we in South Africa observed what was called the &quot;Three Minutes Pause&quot;,   At noon each day all work,all talk and all movement were suspended for three rjnutesthat we might concentrate as one in thinking of those - the living and the dead - who had pledged and giv n themselves farall that we believe in.   In Cape Town it was the twelveo&apos; clock gun that gave thf signal, and in a f*?w seconds thewhole place was still.,  Silence, complete and arresting, closetUpon the City - the moving aw^-inspiring silence of a vastCathedral where the smallest sound must seem a sacrilege.   Onthe Rand Gsldfields, from the sirens and hooters on the min^one great blast Bwept al^ng the fifty miles of reef, andperfect sil&apos;nce followed.   Only thos^ who have experienced it
can realise the effect of thin sudden call to all.   It was as though a trumpet call had sounded through the   orld,&quot;Stop - and Thin1 &quot;!   Only those who have felt it can under-stand the overmastering effect in action and reaction of amultitude moved suddenly to one thought and one purpose.Only those Tho have been swept along by nuch a tide can guessthe force of a common will and a connon purpono appealingto the beot that is in us.   And none will deny that thopurpose was achieved.   Some call it thoughty some prayer;some mere emotion.   Call it what you&apos; will;- tho effect ismagnetic.   The feeling - the conviction - of those who hadmost at stake wan that for some moments there ma&quot; directintense comratiicn with the absent    the living ant.1 the dead.\7hether that be fact or illusion all were the better for it;for, at its leant, it united us all in one grateful andunselfish purpose.Thin!^ what would have boen the effect of such apause in the great peace Procession 1IThy not perpetuate this and extend it to the 7/holeEmoire ?The day and the ver- hour are narked out for us.Armistice Day at 11 of clock.   None will forget the eleventhhour on the eleventh day of the eleventh month.   when the ,last shot was fired   our first thought was for tho a&apos;1 whohad fallen, and it is fitting that on this day in every year wc unite in one salute to them.   Prom tho Heart ofthe Empire to its uttermost limits, just silence andremembrance INo organisation is needed.   If the word wet out from the Pr&quot;sn, the call at the hour would come from gunor belfry, from &quot;line, factory or strip; one co^l allround the World; and flags at ma-thead, for it is not inturning but in -greeting that we should salute them onthat day.  d:hen we are divided it may se^ve to remind us ofthe greater things wc hold in common.   when we are goneIt may help to -bring home to those who will come afterus tho meaning, the nobility, and the unselfishness of thegreat sacrifice by which their freedom was assured.It is due to the women who have lost and sufferedand borne so much, with whom the thought is ever present.   Itis due to the children that they know to whom they owetheir dear-brought heritage of freedom.   It is duo to themen, and from them - as men I   But far and away above allelse it is due to those who gave their all, who noughtno recompense, and(whom we never can repay - our Gloriousand Immortal Dead i
