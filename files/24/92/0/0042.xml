It is the moral effect upon children of daily contact with such men.Doctor P. Bouloumie, Vice-President of the Unionfraternelle des Blesses de la Grande Guerre, hasrecently urged the training of soldiers as teacherson these grounds; and there can be little doubt thatsuch contact must have a good effect. The teacher&apos;srecord with its lesson of sacrifice and courage and discipline symbolised, we should hope, by a proper display of his ribbons would go a goodway to inculcate a recollection and an imitation ofsuch attributes in his pupils. We can imagine thetruant and even the scallywag paying involuntaryhomage to such a man and his teaching. If it isnecessary in this connection to lay the old ghostof a fear of militarism: well, it may be safelyasserted that the present day old soldier will notwar.We print elsewhere extracts from the Report ofthe Inter-Departmental Committee on tuberculosis-losis as it affects ex-Service men. SirJulxTs^s      Montague Barlow, who, as deputy chairman, practically fulfilled theentire duties of Chairman, spoke on this Report inthe House of Commons during the debate on theEstimates for increases of Pension. Then he emphasised some points which emerge on reading the Report: that the ex-Service man has to fit intothe existing administration for treatment, and thatthis administration throughout the country is fouryears in arrear of its sanatoria schemes on account ofthe war; that consequently the treatment of the ex-Service men has had to be carried on at the expenseof the civilian population. There was not enoughaccommodation to go round. From this melancholythought it is consoling to turn to the more hopefulprospects embodied in the idea of permanent vil-lage settlements. These are to be the final stageafter the sanatorium and the training colony; in them the man will live and work at: his trade, his family with him. As proposed in fact, as inexistence at Papworth, near Cambridge these vil-lage settlements differ materially from the &quot; labourcolony.&quot; The man will settle in the village as hewould in any other, with the advantage of medicalhelp that knows his limitations and his difficulties.In the words of Sir Montague Barlow, the pro-posal to the men would be something in this wise:&quot; There is a cottage there in the vil-permanent   laSe ready for you. Won&apos;t you comevillages,    with your family and live there ? Youwill have medical help, you can work at an industry under proper conditions, you will bepaid the standard rate of wages for the district.&quot;It is an invitation which should appeal to those whose capacities are definitely restricted.   Theadvantages, even for those who are just handi-
capped enough to be for ever anxious as to theirchances, should outweigh any disinclination, oftenbased on wrong ideas, to live in such settlements.Not the,least of these advantages is healthy sur-roundings for the wife and children ; evidence wasgiven that the wives of settlers at Papworth wereenvied for their opportunities. The village settle-ment certainly holds factors of success for thefuture. But the question comes straightway : Is itsufficient for the present ? Can it be &quot; got going &quot;soon enough, After all, the essence of grapplingwith disease is wholesale measures quickly. Everysufferer who cannot at once be shepherded into thecircle of treatment is an active enemy to any cura-tive scheme. So whether more temporary measures there must be Army huts available would notbe more effective is open to question. However,there is the prospect offered by the village settle-ment of assured industry under conditions ofassured self-respect.One other point worthy of special consideration,dealt with in the Report, is the refusal-actual and prospective of the self-governinga natural Dominions to accept tuberculous menrefusal. as immigrants. Sir Kingsley Wood,another member of the Committee,gave an instance, recently, where a man certifiedas no longer infectious was refused settlement inBloemfontein. Such a refusal cannot fairly beconsidered unnatural: the respective Governmentsof these Dominions have a duty to their own people, be they never so nearly allied by kinshipand association with the people of the mother country. It certainly seems hard that our mencannot get the benefit of the milder climates of,say, South Africa the traditional country of so many cures and Australia. But in this theDominions must be allowed their own decision.Nor should it be forgotten that land-work naturally associated with the Dominions is not sogenerally suitable for.the tuberculous man as is usually supposed. But, perhaps, it is not too muchto hope for the future, that when the village settle-ments have been proven in this country, arrange-ments might be made to establish similar villages,for incipient cases, in countries of the Dominionswhere the climate would add a benefit notobtainable here.The Select Committee on Pensions having issuedits first interim report, has been holding furthersittings to hear evidence relating topensions     Dependents&apos; allowances and Officers&apos;select      pensions.   Among recent witnesses,committee.    j^rs. Austen Chamberlain explained the Association for Officers&apos; Families,which had secured premises at Battersea Park,Paddington, Hampstead, Cheltenham, and Oxford-primarily intended for widows.    The rate ofrental was just enough to cover rates and taxes.Mr. C. F. Adair Hore, Assistant Secretary of theMinistry of Pensions, gave further evidence beforethe Committee on the question of pensions and gratuities to dependents. He computed that thenumber of beneficiaries approached 300,,000), and explained the difficulty of assessing a possible con-tribution of a son, pointing out that this contribu-tion usually decreased with the son&apos;s marriage.The Committee has found that it will be in theinterests of all concerned if they postpone their further report, which they had hoped would beissued during the past parliamentary session, until after the recess. The reason for this decision isthe desire to obtain further evidence, which is not sufficiently available during this period of recess.Apparently in New Zealand the same misunder-standing has arisen as in this country, regarding the signing of a statement, on dischargemisunoer. or demobilisation, to the effect thatstanding. the soldier is not suffering from anydisability. In New Zealand, as here,there is an idea that by signing this statement Z22 in this country a man has signed away his right to pension, and that should he develop latersome disability, he is barred from claiming.Neither here nor in New Zealand does the signing of any statement as to state of health on dischargeor demobilisation disqualify a man from claimingpension for a recurrence or development of diseaseattributable to service. It was a natural misunder-standing. Nor would the medical examination ofeach man on demobilisation as has been sug-gested have helped to make the position clearer.It might have, in fact, acted disadvantageous^towards the man. Having once been medically examined he might conceivably have found greater difficulty in substantiating a subsequent claim. Asit is, his right to claim pension is as good as if hehad signed nothing.We are glad to be able to state that interest inthe GAZETTE is widening and that the circulationis going up.

&apos;   247October, 1919.War Pensions Gazette383A NATIONAL ROLL OF EMPLOYERS,&quot;THIS HIGH AND SOLEMN OBLIGATION,&quot;The Ministry of Labour has issued particulars of this scheme whereby the disabled shall be absorbed into the industrial community in con-formity with the ideal embodied in the King&apos;sProclamation on behalf of ex-Service men.It is estimated that the number of disabled ex-Service men (including those yet to be discharged from Army hospitals, etc.) represents about 5 percent, of the total number of workers in the coun-try. Nearly seven-eighths of them are already employed. The object of this scheme, which hasbeen discussed withthe majority of thestaple trades in thecountry, as represented by the National TradeAdvisory Committeesand Industrial Councils,is to secure and main-tain the complete ab-sorption of all disabledmen, coupled with an equitable distributionamong the several in-dustries.It has been in somecases accepted outright,in others accepted with modifications, and inthe engineering andslnpbuilding trades isforming the subject offurther local discussion.Every employer inthe United Kingdomwho employs 10 ormore workers is urged to undertake to employas many disabled ex-Service men as pos-sible, with a minimum of  5  per  cent,   (therepresentative proportion as given above) of histotal establishment, including men, women, andjuveniles. Some employers will no doubt be ableto absorb a higher percentage than five, and theyare strongly urged to do so.A &quot; disabled &quot; man is(a) any man in possession of a disablementpension.(b) any man who has received from the Minis-try of Pensions a gratuity for a minor dis-ablement or aggravation of a complaint,and who is adjudged by the Local Em-ployment Committee to be incapacitated,either wholly or in part, from followinghis normal occupation.The disabled men at present unemployed areTHE KINGS PROCLAMATION.George R I.We having learned that many men returned from Service withour Navy, Armies, and Air Forces, disabled, whether by wounds orphysical afflictions, have not yet found a permanent means of livili-hoofand being persuaded that it is a dear obligation upon all who,not least through the endeavours of these men under the mercy ofAlmighty God, enjoy the blessing of victorious peace, to makeacknowledgment of what they have suffered in our behalf.Now, therefore, We have thought fit by and with the advice ofOur Privy Council, to issue this Our Royal Proclamation mostearnestly charging all those of Our loyal subjects, being employers of labour, that they do bind themselves to take into and keep intheir service as many, being thus disabled, as their several businesseswill allow, nit being held back in their performance of this high andsolemn obligation, either by fear of inconvenience or loss, but ratheromitting nothing which will secure that occupation be found withoutdelay for all these wliose lack of employment would offend the generalconscience: andtothis end, We have signified Our will and pleasurethat the National Roll of those who undertake to employ such men,in accordance with the plans prepared by Our Minister oj Labour,shall be styled and known as the King&apos;s National Roll. And We dohereby further exhort all Ministers of Religion in their respectivechurches and chapels within Our United Kingdom of Great Britainand Ireland to read, or cause to be read, this Our Proclamation, onsuch convenient days as may be arranged after the issue thereof.Given cl Our Court al Buckinaham Palace this Eigh-teenth day of August, in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nineteen, and in the Tenthyear oj Our Reign.GOD SAVE THE KING.not an unemployable residue; they are largely un-skilled men, the disabled skilled men having already been absorbed to a large extent into their pre-war employment.The percentage to be adopted for a trade hasbeen indicated by the advisory central bodies.Where, however, no such central body has issued a recommendation, or where the recommendationissued does not fit local circumstances, the LocalTechnical Advisory Committees, as representingthe concensus of local trade opinion, will prescribe the percentage applic-able to the particular circumstances of thecase.It is not intended that these proposals should lead to dilutionof skilled labour; andit is not proposed thatany disabled man whohas not the necessarytraining should be em-ployed on any workpreviously performed by skilled men. Noris the present schemeto interfere with theagreements in regardto training drawn upby the Trade AdvisoryCommittees and theTraining Departmentof the Ministry ofLabour. The primary object is to supplement the training schemes(which are as yet only partially developed) byabsorbing disabled meninto unskilled occupa-tions   for   which   no special training is required.At the same time, it is obviously in the interestsof the disabled men that they should be trainedsooner or later either in training institutions; or inthe workshops of an emplover. It is thereforecontemplated that disabled men absorbed into industry, under the present scheme, without pre-liminary training, should be eligible for training ata later stage (when training facilities have been further developed) in accordance with agreementsentered into between employers and unions.Meanwhile an employer will be allowed to counttowards the number represented by his agreed pef-centage any disabled men undergoing training inhis workshops; and any vacancies as to which hegives the Ministry of Labour a definite guarantee
that they will be filled by disabled men trainedelsewhere.The wages of disabled men who have undergonea course of training will, of course, be governed by the conditions laid down for trainees in theagreements made with the Trade Advisory Com-mittees.In trades where special arrangements are inoperation for settling questions of wages, thewages of untrained disabled men on work not normally performed by skilled men will naturally be settled in accordance with those arrangements.In other trades it is proposed to continue the sys-tem now in force, viz., that disabled men should,as a general rule, receive the district rate of wages.Disability pension should not be taken intoaccount when computing a disabled man&apos;s rate of wage.Employers are urgently requested to give their support to these proposals by filling up and signinga Form of Undertaking. The form should then be despatched to the Secretary of the Local Employ-ment Committee, who will then do his utmost tomeet the employers&apos; additional requirements asregards disabled men. When the undertaking hasbeen received by the Local Employment Com-mittee and is in order, a certificate will be issued to the employer by the Minister of Labour and thename of the employer will be inscribed on aNational Roll which will be kept by the Ministry ofLabour. The employer will be entitled to usean official device on his correspondence paper,indicating that he is a participant in the scheme.Steps are being taken to apply the provisions ofthis scheme to Government Departments, and localauthorities will be invited to follow the lead of theGovernment.Employers can be relieved of any additionalliability under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act,which the employment of disabled men may entail,under a Government scheme, details of which canbe obtained from the Home Office or from the nearest Employment Exchange.The scheme is to be administered through theLocal Employment Committees in consultation,where they exist, with the Local TechnicalAdvisory Committees, except in trades wherespecial arrangements have been made for thematter to be dealt with by the trade itself.The Soldiers and Sailors Families Association hasrecently issued a Circular (Post-War Circular, No. i)giving instructions as to the operations of the Associa-tion at the present time.Among the various subjects dealt with, emphasis is laid on the importance of co-operation between Branchesof the Association and Local War Pensions Committeesand the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Help Society.

248October, 1019.War Pensions Gazette385DIAMOND POLISHING: PROSPECTS.by w.  beckit burn1e,  d.sc.A man with a 50 per cent, disability does not want an employment chosen for him which makeshis earning capability half that of the normal work-man. His disability is calculated on the averageof all trades, but it is most important that the tradeinto which he is put should be one where his dis-ability does not affect or only slightly affects hisearning power. If this can be achieved, then, atthe end of his period of training, he will be earn-ing full workman&apos;s wages, and drawing his pensionas well. Thus, though less well-off than the aver-age workman in respect of his physical condition,he will be even better placed than, the averageworkman in respect of his weekly income.It is desirable, then, that there should be inEnglandnumbers of fac-tories wherework suitablefor men withparticular dis-abilities is car-ried on, on thelinesof Mr. Ber-nard Oppen-heimer&apos;s dia-mond factoriesi n Brightonand elsewhere.Mr. Oppen-heimer under-takes to trainand subse-quently em-ploy disabledmen in dia-mond polish-in g; workwhich  is  par-ticularly suitable for men who have lost legs, inthat it is done entirely seated, and is so highly skilled that men who have learnt it can commandexcellent wages. Men who have lost one or bothlegs or even three fingers on one hand, who suffer from trench feet or non-infectious chest diseases-provided that they are not more than thirty yearsof age are able to earn as much money at thisoccupation as men who have never been in thearmy. The work is not suitable for men who have lost a hand or an eye, or have shell shock or pooreyesight.The factories which have been put up in Brightonaccommodate at present 500 men, and a new fac-tory to take a further 1,500 is nearing completion.There are also training centres at Cambridge, nowfull; at Fort William, recently opened; and atWrexham, almost complete. During the first sixmonths of training the men are maintained by theThe Diamond Workers of Brighton.Ministry of Pensions or the Ministry of Labour,and receive no wages from the firm. At the end oftheir training they receive a minimum wage oftwo pounds per week. A careful record is kept oftheir work; and as they get more proficient theirwages are put up, so that the average wages formen who have been in training twelve monthsexceed  2 15s. per week, and after two years that is, six months under maintenance and eighteen months under wages the men should be able to earn between four and six pounds per week.The processes involved are chiefly the polishingof stones by pressure against a swiftly revolvingdisc; and the skill that is necessary is due to theextreme hardness of the diamonds, which if not properly han-dled are liableto destroy thedisc; the ac-curacy, too,with which thediamonds mustbe cut in orderto be saleable,has to be ac-quired.The work-shops are cleanand airy andade q u a t e 1 yprovided withlifts, so that men who can-not easily usestairs can get to their work incomfort. Thereis also a can-teen, where agood mid-day meal can be obtained for a shilling;a surgery on the premises with a permanent medi-cal officer, where accidents and minor illnesses canbe dealt with; and a large recreation room. Inthe town there are four Eccentric Club hostelswhere the men can lodge.Men who wish to take up this trade should applyto their local Pensions Committees, who will sendin their names to the Divisional Director, Ministryof Labour, who will see that they are put on the waiting list.There are two things, however, that men wishing to take up this trade should bear in mind. Thefirst one is that at present there is a waiting list.There will be no vacancies till this list has beenabsorbed, and this cannot be done till the new buildings are completed. Applicants at the presenttime will, therefore, have to wait two or, threemonths before they can be taken.
The second thing that applicants should remem-ber is that their wages at the end of the period oftraining will be  2 per week. If they feel thatthey cannot live for a time on this and their pen-sions, they should not apply.The trade is a very skilled one. So it takeslonger to learn, and though the wages rise in thelong run the men are still learners at the end ofthe first six months, and their wages are lower thanthey would be able-to obtain in some other occu-pations. The prospects are excellent, but in orderto get big wages a man must become more skilledthan he can be in six months. For men who areprepared to take for a time  2 per week, and meanto apply themselves to getting hold of the art ofdiamond polishing, there is no trade that offerssuch good prospects.War Pensions Gazette.No. 30.OCTOBER, 1919.TWOPENCE.The Editor will be -pleased to consider contributions and photographs, which he will return if unsuitable.Communications for the Editor should be addressed :Millbank House, Westminster, London, S.W.I.The Ministry of Pensions does not necessarily endorseopinions expressed by contributors.Communications concerning subscriptions and salesshould be addressed to H.M.

Children, forthis purpose, are children eligible for allowancesunder Article XII. of the Royal Warrant.seamen and marines.Article I. (4) of the Order in Council, relating toadditions for rank, will not be affected, but certainadjustments of rates are now being made in accord-ance with the recommendations of the Jerram Com-mittee. The allowances for wife and children willbe the same as in Army cases.The rates for widows will be :  New Rate.Under 40 Previousand         In Ratewithout other with children, cases. bonus.Widow  of Marine Warrant  Officer,Class  i  ......................................   201-     40h 25/6Widow of Marine  Warrant   Officer,Class 2 .......................................  26/8     35/7 22/6Widow of C.P.O., etc....................   25/-     33/4 21/-Widow of 1st Class P.O.

In other circum-stances, i.e., where the widow is 40 or over, or haschildren, it will be two-thirds of the husband&apos;s pre-war earnings, similarly increased, subject to amaximum of 66s. 8d. Widows&apos; alternative pen-sions in issue will be reviewed without application,and so also will cases in which applications received under the 1918 Warrant have been rejected.The above new rates will continue for at least three years and thereafter will be subject tore-adjustment according to the cost of living, butin any case they will not be lowered by more than20 per cent, or under the previous rates (includingbonus).DISABLED IN INDUSTRY.Mr. Garrad Harris, of the Research Division ofthe Federal Board for Vocational Education,United States of America, has recently raised a significant suggestion in &quot; Redemption of the Dis-abled.&quot; Though it concerns those disabled in industry, it should give thought to all who havebeen brought in contact with the problems of thosedisabled in this war.Mr. Harris, in tracing the gradual recognitionand development in all countries of a State dutytowards the social and industrial reinstatement ofthe disabled soldier, arrives at the new spiritwhich he believes has been acquired in all coun-tries towards the problem of the disabled. Hecontends that the same spirit should be extended
-   249October, 1919. War Pensions Gazette 387to those disabled in industry, whose lives havehitherto often been wasted owing to indifferenceand the lack of any defined policy. The yearlytoll of these industrial casualties in the UnitedStates is estimated at 14,000; added to whichmust be reckoned those disabled by tuberculosisand occupational diseases.A Bill has been introduced in Congress to make provision for vocational education of industrialcasualties under the existing administration andon the same lines as those now adopted for the disabled soldier.   It is a big-minded idea.Perhaps when the pressure on the great organ-isation in this country for reinstating the disabledhas grown less, some of the ability and establish-ment might be diverted to the betterment of thosedisabled in industry. We have been shown latelywhat education self-education, too can do forthe disabled in the recent lectures and exhibitionsby those two resourceful men, Mr. MichaelDowling and Judge Corley. A description of theircapabilities was given in an article by Mrs. Woodin the September issue of the GAZETTE. Theywere both what might be termed civil casualties;and they both happened to be Americans.The sympathy and experience so painfullyacquired to meet the disablements of this warcould not be better perpetuated. After all, the instrument of the visitation whether it be a&quot; Jack Johnson &quot; or a circular saw, Gas or lead poisoning, is immaterial. The hardship andhandicap of mutilation or invalidism is equallytragic; and it has been stated many times that work in the factory was as needful as duty in the trenches. With peace, the factory work combinesthe double function in the economic struggle ofnations, to which there can be no armistice.So why. not a like solicitude for those disabledin industry ? It becomes a logical development ofcommon sense and experience.The Minister of Pensions recently visited New-castle-on-Tyne for the purpose of inaugurating theNorthern Region for Pensions, which includes the counties of Northumberland, Durham and Cumber-land. In explaining the scheme of decentralisationhe had something to say on the numbers and thecost of pensions. Further, he emphasised the factthat a pension was now a statutory right. Ques-tions were invited and a number of points con-nected with the new scheme of administration were raised.Sir L. Worthington Evans also visited Bristol on thenth September &quot;to inaugurate the South WesternRegion, which includes Gloucestershire, Somerset, Devon,Cornwall, Dorset and Wiltshire. The Lord Mayorpresided over the meeting, which was attended by representatives of the Local War Pensions Committees.The pensioners in this Region are computed to be some145,000, including widows and dependents.APPOINTMENTS.The following appointments of Principal Officers toLocal Committees and Sub-Committees have beenapproved (L.C., Local Committee; S.C., Sub-Committee):TO BE SECRETARIES :-R.

TUBERCULOSIS; COMMITTEE REPORT.Being extracts of the Report by the Inter-Departmental Committee appointed to consider andreport upon the immediate practical steps which should be taken for the provision of resi-dential treatment for discharged soldiers and sailors suffering from Tuberculosis, and fortheir re-introduction into employment, especially on the land. The Committee have held 17meetings, and the repot t is dated August, 1919.general,The total number of tuberculous ex-Service men,whether invalided out of the Services on account oftuberculosis, or afterwards found to be suffering fromtuberculosis attributable to, or aggravated by, conditionsof service, amounts to approximately 35,000. Of this number, 22,000 have received, or are now receiving, resi-dential treatment, which has often been for far too short a period. There are some 4,000 men at present under-going residential treatment. It must be borne in mind that, as shown in the evidence before us, discharged soldiers sometimes refuse sanatorium treatment for various reasons. In other cases they leave the sana-sanatorium after only a few weeks&apos; treatment.Certain witnesses and authors of memoranda have urged that men suffering from tuberculosis should.beretained in the Services until cured. Such a proposal,if put into operation, would, in our opinion, be nothing-less than the utilisation of the military machine as a means of making treatment compulsory on public healthgrounds, and not for military purposes. The function ofthe Army is not to cure tuberculosis, this duty falling onthe Public Health Authority, and the fact that a manhas served in the Navy or Army does not relieve thedistrict to which he belongs of the obligation to providethe necessary treatment.We find that the ex-Service men undergoing residentialtreatment are occupying at the present time one-third toone-half of the total number of beds available for thetreatment of the adult male population suffering fromtuberculosis.Probably, taking all things into consideration, thegeneral health of men who have served in the Army hasbeen improved so as to render them more resistant todisease. This may reduce the amount of tuberculosisin the future.We consider that the best interests, both of the coun-try and of the ex-Service man, will be served, first by making the best possible use of all existing means oftreatment, and then, by expanding, improving, and in-creasing these means as rapidly as possible.In&apos; the course of our deliberations we have found itconvenient to divide cases of tuberculosis generally into three classes : (a) early; (b) middle; and (c) advancedcases.In the case of ex-Service men, the great bulk of cases will be found in the middle group, and the percentageto be found in the class of early cases is regrettablysmall.financial arrangements now in force,The special arrangements in force for the residentialtreatment of discharged soldiers and sailors sufferingfrom tuberculosis are made by the Ministry of Healththrough the local Insurance Committees. -These arrangements secure that discharged Servicemen needing residential treatment shall have priority of admission to institutions over ordinary civilians. Con-ditionally upon such priority being given and residentialtreatment, being continued for so long as the medicaladvisers to the insurance committees consider it neces-&apos;sary, the cost of such treatment is borne as follows : (1) a sum equal to the average cost of treating a similar number\ tt    Clviljans is charged to the insurance funds, and(4) The remainder, over and above this amount, is borne by theExchequer and is charged to the vote of the pensions ministry.At any rate, as from the beginning of the presentyear, no discharged Service man&apos;s residential treatment is being restricted on financial grounds, since the Ex-chequer have assumed what is in effect an unlimitedliability in regard to the cost of such treatment, whichis to be extended over such period as competent medicalopinion considers necessary for the effective treatmentof each case.shortage op existing accommodation.The evidence shows that the number of beds available,generally speaking, for the male adult population is between 10,000 and 11,000.It is quite clear that this number of beds for the treat-ment both of the discharged ex-Service man and of the civilian adult male population is most seriously in-adequate.The figures of the official &quot;waiting lists&quot; of discharged soldiers indicate that at present some 500 men are a wait-ing institutional treatment. These figures do not in any-real sense reflect the shortage of accommodation for ex-Service men; generally because the men themselvesoften refuse or terminate their treatment, as they, fearthere are no proper after-care provisions; or they are recommended for inadequate periods of residential treat-ment by the tuberculosis officers, who cannot fail to Leconscious of the urgent civilian needs.It is clear from the evidence before us that the tenta-tive standard suggested in the Report of the Depart-mental Committee on Tueberculosis of 1912 (generally known as the Astor Report), that is, one sanatoriumbed and one hospital bed for every 5,000 inhabitants,firstly, has not been carried out over the country, and,secondly, is shown to be insufficient with the greaterknowledge as to the extent of the disease which we nowpossess. Present estimates of the accommodation re-quired in Glasgow are based on two and a half times the Astor standard; the Liverpool figures are even higher; while in Lanarkshire the District Council of theMiddle Ward propose sanatorium and hospital accom-modation at six times the Astor standard. It will beremembered that the Astor Committee suggested thatthe standard set up by them in 1912 should Only beregarded as a temporary one, and likely to requireeventual revision.The occupation by the War Office of local hospitals and sanatoria, coupled with the decision of the Govern-rrient early in the war to stop the building of sanatoria,has rendered the task of the local authorities one of extreme difficulty.The present accommodation in London for both menand women includes a total of some 750 adult beds.Plans and specifications were prepared and approved forthree institutions near Basingstoke, East Grinstead, andGodalming for the accommodation of 575 patients. Ithas recently been decided that these new institutionsshould at once be proceeded with.Further, the Pinewood Sanatorium, near Woking-ham, has been acquired by the Metropolitan AsylumsBoard as a going concern, and it is hoped to double theexisting accommodation of 64 beds without delay and tomake this accommodation available- for ex-Service men.We feel, however, that there will still remain a deficiency of accommodation to meet the needs of the London area.In Liverpool, the present total accommodation is about
25October, 1919. War Pensions Gazette 389670* beds, but in the view of the authorities themselvesthere is still a shortage, It is fair to observe, however,that the standard of accommodation set for themselves by the Liverpool Council is a high one, namely, one bedfor about every 700 of the population. In Leeds, where,as in Liverpool, special difficulty in meeting the require-ments of exiService men has been experienced, themilitary authorities have now released a large institutionwhich, it is hoped, will result at a very early date in theprovision of a number of beds. In Glasgow, apart fromPoor Law beds, there are 637 beds. Proposals before thewar were included in the Council&apos;s scheme for increas-iijg this total by a further 280 beds.accommodation: army hutments and voluntaryprovision,The information before the Committee, and especially the representations of the expert advisers of the Ministryof Health, goes to show that the use of Army hutmentsgenerally for the treatment of tuberculosis is not likelyto provide satisfactory accommodation. But in spite ofthese general considerations, in view of the urgency ofthe problem with regard to the provision for ex-Servicemen, we are of opinion that in all cases where there is serious deficiency of accommodation, and huts of the better type are available, the local authority should take steps to make use of huts, and where they decide to doso, they should be able to secure the huts from the Govern-meht without charge, as they cannot be expected to expend large sums of money on what, from the natureof the case, can only be a temporary provision.Letters have been laid before the Committee from lord balfour of Burleigh, on behalf of Queen Alexandra^Sanatorium at Davos, suggesting that accommodation would be available in that magnificent institution fortuberculous ex-Service men for the next two years.Lord Queenborough also wrote on behalf of the Indus-trial Settlements for Disabled Soldiers and Sailors,making a proposal for securing Preston Hall, near Maid-stone, for a similar purpose. In addition, the Red Crosshave given generous assistance.training colonies and permanent villagesettlementsTraining Colonies and Permanent Village Settlements,together with Sanatoria, must be considered as three stages or divisions of a general scheme of treatment,training, and employment.First the Sanatorium, where treatment is mainlyemphasised; next the Colony, where treatment is con-tinued but training is the main objective; thirdly, thePermanent Village Settlement, where permanent em-ployment is afforded, but always under medical super-vision.The training colony should merge into the permanentvillage settlement as the sanatorium does into the train-ing colony.We consider that facilities for occupational training should be provided in all sanatoria, and especially inthose sanatoria in which discharged men are treated.Useful work, especially work from which the patientsthemselves may hope to receive some small reimiiera-tion, not only prevents boredom and irritation, but is adirect aid to recovery. The primary test of the suitability of work is whether it has a beneficial effect upon thecondition of the patient.training colonies.These are to be regarded as extensions of sanatoria,work being prescribed as part of the treatment, andcarefully adjusted to the physical capabilities of indi-vidual patients.   With this carefully graduated physical&apos;labour, patients as a rule show steady and progressive* This figure includes 233 beds for children. a total of about 930beds will be available shortly, and it is hoped that proposals now on foot will ultimately provide for a total of over r,2oo beds.improvement. These colonies are in fact testing as wellas training grounds for convalescent tuberculouspatients, many of whom regain working capacity withthe risk of relapse reduced to a minimum.Evidence has been given, or memoranda put before theCommittee, regarding the following training colonies :-Kinson.-This consists of a farm of 33 acres, withaccommodation for 22 patients in wooden chalets. Train-ing is provided with a view to fitting men for smallholding cultivation and similar agricultural work.Hairmyres. This colony extends to about 300 aciesof land, and the scheme proposes accommodation for250-300 patients of different ages and sexes. The train-ing embraces general farm work, market gardening,pig and poultry rearing, dairy farming, forestry.Walkington. The present accommodation is for 25persons (17 men and 8 women). The land available is30 acres, and this is likely to be extended. The colonistsare trained by an expert market gardener in marketgardening, fruit growing, intensive horticulture, pig and poultry rearing. Arrangements are also made for bootrepairing and carpentry.Springfield. This colony provides accommodation for about 25 patients of both sexes. The patients areemployed in vegetable and flower growing, poultry andpig rearing, and to some extent in general farm work.Mill House, Nayland. A suitable house and factoryhave been acquired at Nayland for the purpose of a colony. Selected patients, after a course of sanatoriumtreatment, are transferred to the colony house and em-ployed in chairmaking, light metal work, or other suit-able industry in the factory. Married patients are encouragement-aged to settle in the village and to continue to work atthe factory.In Norfolk it is proposed to start a colony, and a farmof 800 acres, situated about five miles from Norwich, hasbeen obtained. It is hoped that men&apos;s families will been abled to reside in the colony, or in small holdingsattached to it. The first proposal is for a pavilion formen, and then to extend to cottages, etc., for their families.These training colonies are generally only intended toprovide for a limited period of training, usually from 6to 12 months.Evidence shows that agricultural work, training forwhich has been unduly emphasised in the past, is not generally suitable for those who have suffered fromtuberculosis.All existing sanatoria which have no provision fortraining should be encouraged officially at once to under-take extension on training colony lines..We consider that men ^ would be much more willingto enter, sanatoria than they are at present if they knew that in so doing they had a definite prospect of con-tinued treatment and training in colonies where neces-sarv, and, later on, care in permanent settlements.Major Prichard, giving evidence on behalf of the &quot;Com-rades of the Great War,&quot; stated that there would be many more applicants for sanatorium treatment if menunderstood that some form of post-sanatorium trainingwas available, and also a prospect of permanent employ-ment under suitable conditions.Reference has been made above to the general unsuit-ability of agricultural work for tuberculous patients.Where, however, the disease is effectively arrested andmen have been trained and found in all respects to be suitable for settlement on the land, as at Kinson, it isrlearlv imperative that proper arrangement should bemade for the provision of small holdings as part of the jp-eneral Government scheme for settling ex-Service men &apos;on the land. \ ,permanent village &quot;settlements.We have most carefully considered the combined sana-sanatorium, training colony section, and village settlement
at Papworth, where experimental work on&apos; the lines ofthree combined and co-ordinated departments has been conducted.Papworth consists of an estate of 350 acres, with alarge country house as its centre. The institution, whichhas at present accommodation for about 80 patients,comprises: (a) A sanatorium and hospital. Men on arrival are placed in the sanatorium for observation, andthe more advanced cases remain there; (b) the train-ing colony section. Patients whose condition improvesand who pass to this section are accommodated inshelters in the grounds; (c) the village settlement.When a man is fit to do work he is sent to the train-ing colony section and is offered employment correspond-ing as nearly as possible with his original occupation,but he is still regarded as a patient, and for the first two months is reckoned as on probation and receivesno pay. After two months he begins to receive pay.By the end of the third month a man&apos;s working capacityusually increases to four hours a day, and by remaining in the training colony section he gradually increases this to a normal six hours.Workshops are provided, and training is given in car-penfry and joinery, cabinet making, gardening, pigand poultry keeping, boot repairing and. tailoring. Thereis also a &quot;colony store.&quot; Patients are employed inmotor driving, and at the electric power station. Thedevelopment of other trades is in contemplation, such aslight metal work and lathe work, but this development will depend on proper instructors being forthcoming whohave been through a sanatorium.It is interesting to note that the estate office itself ismanaged by an ex-soldier, Mr. Crohill, who had himselfreceived treatment for tuberculosis.The outstanding features of the Papworth schemewhich have impressed themselves on the Committeeare the provision of permanent settlement withemployment, after training; and the linking up ofthe three sections of the scheme of treatment under one management. After six months in the trainingcolony section, as mentioned above, the patient is offeredpermanent employment with housing accommodation inthe village settlement, and in every case up to the pre-sent the offer has been accepted. The workshops inwhich the men have been trained also provide employ-ment for them when they have been transferred to thepermanent village settlement.The various forms of village-industry practised in the village settlement, generally speaking, correspond withthe training facilities in the training section. The resi-dents in the village settlement can find employment atthe standard rate of wage in the district in carpentry,joinery, including furniture making, boot making, tailor-ing, etc., carried on in suitable workshops and underhealthy conditions. In addition, there is dairy work,poultry keeping and work on the farm, and also in the village shop, which is managed by an ex-patient fromthe sanatorium. The village settlement at PapNvorthis admittedly only in its infancy at present, and will develop as time goes on; but, in fact, there seems almostno limit to the industries which could be developed in avilla.ee settlement of this kind provided they are com-patible with the conditions of village life. Thus, theproblem of the employment of the tuberculous ex-Serviceman would find a natural solution in the village settle-ment.In our opinion, the village settlement idea, as aboveoutlined, is one of great value, and we venture to hopethat, if developed all over the country, it will be ofmaterial help in dealing with the problem of the tuber-culous soldier and his settlement in life after he has passed through a sanatorium and training colony.general financial considerations.Capital    Expenditure.-Prior   to   the   war,    localauthorities received towards the capital cost of providing an institution an initial payment of a sum not exceeding^90 per bed, or three-fifths of the capital cost, whicheverwas less.In the autumn of 1918, in order to encourage the rapid provision of further accommodation, the Govern-ment offered to local authorities a contribution of ^160a bed towards cost of extensions of existing institutions,or of a sum not exceeding four-fifths of the expenditureon the extensions, whichever was less.In view of the present cost of labour and materials,the amount of the Exchequer contribution clearly calls for revision, and, in fact, we understand that the matter is at present being considered by the Treasury. *Sanatoria and Hospitals We do not feel it necessaryto indicate precisely what should be the basis of theExchequer contribution, but it quite clearly must be atleast double the amount of the contribution on the pre-war basis. Voluntary institutions which are approvedby the Minister of Health should also receive, in ourview, Exchequer support on a similar basis.Training Colonies and similar extensions of Sanatoria. Exchequer assistance should be afforded to at least thesame extent under this head. But in view of the neces-sary provision of workshops, etc., the existing basis of assessment per bed will require modification, and thereshould be an initial Exchequer capital grant of at least three-fifths of the cost. We recommend that the fundsalready available for capital expenditure for this purpose should be supplemented to the extent of at least^250,000.Permanent Village Settlements. We recommend thatthe Government should at once make provision in theEstimates to be presented to Parliament of a sum of000,000 to be used for the purpose of financing thecost of a number of village settlements, on the basisoutlined above, primarily for ex-Service men. Whenthe provision is made by local authorities, the capital sum should be provided outright by the Government inthe first instance. Local authorities might contribute towards the cost after (say) five years, by repaying an agreed proportion (not less than one-fifth) of the capitalexpenditure. The ex-Service man would by that time be gradually merging in the general civilian population,and the Committee would hope that the economic problem of organising the after-care and employmentof tuberculous men in general would then have beeneffectively tackled, so that these settlements would more properly form part of the general schemes of localauthorities for the treatment of tuberculosis. It shouldbe a condition of the grant that the accommodation inany village settlement should not be reserved exclusivelyfor residents in the area of the local authority makingthe provision.In our view, the accommodation in settlements, at anyrate at present, will not be required for more than 2,000to 3,000 men. In order to deal with these numbers, wesuggest as a basis for consideration the provision of, say,ten village settlements in various parts of the country with accommodation varying according to local require-ments from probably 200 to 250 men and their familieswhere necessary.Cost of Treatment and Maintenance of ex-Service Man. Upon the completion of a man&apos;s training, or upon hisleaving the sanatorium or training colony to take upresidence in a village settlement, the question of a furtherpayment by the authorities for his maintenance in thesettlement practically disappears, although it might benecessary to continue some small payment. The financial problem, when the man goes into a village settlement,really becomes one of the question of the continued pay-ment of his pension.The Payment of the Man&apos;s Pension.-During theperiod of a man&apos;s stay in a sanatorium, hospital, or training colony there can be no doubt, in our view, that
&apos;   251October, iqiq. War Pensions Gazette 391the present system of paying an allowance to him at thefull pension rate should be continued. The payment of(his allowance is subject to a deduction of 7s. a week as a set-off against the cost of the man&apos;s maintenance in the institution, which, it may be noted, at presentordinarily costs from  2 to  2 10s. a week.Further, the question then arises what is to be done as regards the payment of a man&apos;s pension upon leaving a sanatorium or training colony. We would point out certain features of his condition which call for special consideration in the assessment of pension. His workingcapacity appears greater than it actually is; his oppor-I unities of obtaining employment are considerably re-duced by this factor and also by the objection ofemployers and workmen to have a &quot;consumptive&quot; in theplace. The importance of an adequate pension will be appreciated when it is remembered how largely the effec-tive treatment of the disease depends upon the ability to provide a generous diet; and upon the removal ofevery source of worry. When the ex-Service man con-sents to submit for the future to the necessary restric-tions attached to residence in a village settlement, hemay justly be considered by the Slate with greatergenerosity than the man who declines to accept thistreatment, advantageous though it would be both to hisown health and to the community.On these grounds we recommend full treatment allow-ances during residence in a sanatorium or trainingcolony, and full pension for at least one year after this,irrespective of whether the man enters a village settle-ment or returns to his former life. At the expiration ofthis period he should be re-surveyed and the pensionassessed according to his disability, but never at less than50 per cent. An additional 20 per cent, up to the maxi-mum disability rate should be added to the pension ofa man who has taken up his residence in a permanentvillage settlement for so long as he remains there.treatment of advanced cases.Small Homes for Advanced Cases. Interesting infor-mation on the system of small homes provided in Norwaywas placed before the Committee, and it was suggestedthat similar homes might be provided in this country.These homes, it was suggested, should take not morethan 30 patients each.We must point out, however, that the cost of estab-lishing and maintaining the requisite number if suchhomes throughout the country would be large, and fromthe evidence submitted to the Committee, it is by nomeans clear that this method of dealing with advancedcases will be generally successful. In our view the pro-vision of these small homes should be undertaken in thelarger centres of population where there seems to beany reasonable prospect of their success.Provision for Advanced Cases in Sanatoria. Provisionfor advanced cases in sanatoria avoids the danger,inherent in small homes, that the advanced accommoda-tion will be looked upon as the last resort of the dying.We believe that the presence of other, and less seriouscases, has a beneficial effect upon the advanced cases,and several witnesses, among them sanatorium patients,have informed us that they did not consider that thepresence of advanced cases had a depressing effect on theother patients.The general medical opinion is that the admission of alargei number of advanced cases of pulmonary tuber-culosis to a single hospital reserved for this purposesolely, is inadvisable. It is preferable to admit to onesanatorium patients in all stages of the diesase if the accommodation is such that they can be graded in differ-cnt wards and pavilions, and if it is within reasonabledistance of the area from which its patients arc drawn.We consider, therefore, that it would be desirable toestablish convalescent hospitals in suitable localities forthe treatment of the somewhat limited class of case need-ing this treatment. These hospitals should have morefacilities for nursing than the usual convalescent home,and should be tinder the regular supervision of a medical officer. They should be available for all tuberculousex-Service men, whether or not tuberculosis was theinvaliding disability. This form of treatment should notbe recommended in lieu of sanatorium treatment, butonly in cases in which sanatorium treatment is not con-sidered necessary. The period of stay should not exceedsix to eight weeks.re-1ntroduction into employment: emigration.The question of re-introduction into employment can-not, in our opinion, be properly considered unless men have had a period of sanatorium and training colonytreatment. Generally speaking, the alternatives are only two. Either after a period of sanatorium and possiblycolony treatment and training, the patient proceeds toa village settlement, or in some similar way resumesemployment under specially sheltered and favourable conditions; or else he returns home and takes up employ-ment under the ordinary conditions of the labour maiket,and his disease from that moment usually begins tore-assert itself and his condition becomes steadily worse.The Committee desire to urge strongly upon localauthorities and large employers of labour that theyshould use every effort to help in solving the difficultyby giving special facilities for the employment, underthe best possible conditions, of ex-Service men who teelunable to take up life in a village settlement.We have made inquiries as to the immigration rulesin Canada and South Africa respectively. As regardsCanada, we find that an Act to amend the ImmigrationAct, passed by the Canadian House of Commons, addsto the list of prohibited persons, those afflicted &quot;withtuberculosis in any form.&quot;In South Africa, in February, 1919, papers entitled,&quot;Correspondence regarding Immigration of ex-Soldiersand Sailors Suffering from Tuberculosis&quot; were laidbefore the House of Assembly of the Union. This in-cluded a statement to the Press (December, 1918), inwhich the following occurs : &quot;The Government hasbeen obliged to refuse their support to a scheme ... to accommodate several hundreds of ex-soldiers and sailorsfrom England who are suffering from tuberculosis,&quot; and&quot;in granting permits to ex-soldiers and sailors to cometo South Africa regard must be had to the exclusion ofpersons suffering from tuberculosis or other infectiousdisease.&quot;We understand that the Australian Government hasadopted a similar attitude.In view of the decisions thus arrived at by the DominionAuthorities, we have felt that it is impossible at thepresent time to make any recommendations for action inthis direction.Miss Duff, honorary secretary of the Smallburgh WarPensions Committee, gave a cup for competition amongthe disabled soldiers training for agriculture at ;theIngharn^ Horticultural Institute. The cup was won byJohn Mingay, who has only one arm.The East Riding Branch of the British Red cross society has acquired and equipped a convalescent homeat Bridlington, which has recently been opened by theLord Mayor of Leeds, and will eventually have accom-modation for some 170.Lynwood, Jesmond Park, Newcastle-on-Tyne, whichwas given by Mr. A.

Craig : A permanent pension may be granted,subject to the conditions of the respective Royal War-rants applying to parents&apos; pensions, to the stepmotherof an officer, or a soldier, provided she has been in theplace of a parent to the officer or soldier, and whollyor mainly supported him for not less than one year atsome time before the commencement of the War.dead officers&apos;  parents,Brigadier-General Croft asked the Pensions Ministerwhat is the number of applications received from deadofficers&apos; parents for monetary compensation; what isthe number of applications granted and the averageamount of the grants; what is the number of applica-tions refused; and what is the maximum income wherea pension has been granted in such cases?Sir J. Craig: Excluding applications not proceeded with and those still under consideration, the numberreceived is 6,815. Of this number, pensions of the aver-age annual value of ^38 were granted in 5,125 cases,gratuities of the average value of ^97 were granted in167 cases, and 1,523 applications were rejected. It isnot possible to state the maximum income where apension has been granted.disability pensions31st July,  1919.Mr. Alfred Davies asked the Pensions Minister how many disability pensions are at present being paid to

At that date 9,722applications for alternative pensions had been receivedfrom disabled men. Of the men so applying, 3,883 were awarded pensions and 4,637 were refused, and 1,202cases were then under inquiry; 37,245 widows applied for alternative pensions, and 21,687 obtained them. Therewere 10,273 rejections, and 5,465 cases were then underinquiry. 1 should add that a large number of alterna-tive pensions granted to men are temporary awards,which lapse as the man&apos;s earning capacity increases.The number of alternative pensions to men now being paid is, approximately, 1,000.HORIiURY JUNCTION WAGON WORKS STRIKE,6th August, 1919.Mr, Lunn asked the Minister of Labour whether hewill agree to the discharged soldiers and sailors thrown out of work through the strike at Messrs. Roberts and company, wagDn works, Horbury Junction, receiving umemployment benefits from his Department, seeing theyhave no means of subsistence except through recourse to the Poor Law?Sir R. Home : I understand that the men to whomthe hon. Member refers are unemployed in consequenceof a trade dispute at the premises at which they were employed. In these circumstances the rules under whichunemployment benefit is granted prevent their receivingout-of-work donation during the continuance of the stop-page of work caused by the dispute.LOCAL WAR PENSIONS COMMITTEES.nth August, 1919.Mr. Mosley asked the Minister of Pensions whether he will direct that at least two representatives fromorganisations of discharged men shall sit on each local war pensions committee?Sir J. Craig : The Naval and Military War Pensions,etc. (Committees) Act, 1917, provides for the inclusionof at least two discharged disabled men in the member-ship of local war pensions committees. It is open to theappointing body to invite recommendations from organ-isations of discharged men, and this method of selectionhas been largely adopted. My right hon. Friend hasalready arranged for the issue of a Circular to localauthorities urging upon them the necessity when fillingvacancies on local committees of increasing to at leastfour the representation of discharged men, and specific-ally inviting them to approach associations of ex-Servicemen for recommendations.KING&apos;S FUND.Major Sir Edward Coates asked the Pensions minister whether moneys granted from the King&apos;s Fund have inthe past been administered by the Local War. pensions committee, who have taken care that the money is applied as directed, in all cases seeing the receipts; arethe grants now sent direct to the applicants from theCivil Liabilities Commission; and do they see that themoney is so applied?Sir Laming Worthington-Evans : I have been asked to reply to this question. The answer to the first part is,I am informed, in the affirmative. I am considering thequestion of asking the Local War Pensions committees to pay, on behalf of the Civil Liabilities Department, the grants awarded by that Department in the type of casesrecently taken over from the King&apos;s Fund.  Hitherto thepractice of the Civil Liabilities Department has been topay such grants direct to the applicants (as they do inthe cases which the War Pensions Committees havenever been concerned) subject in each case to adequate safeguards as to the proper application of the money.CIVIL LIABILITIES GRANT,Sir E. Coates asked the Minister of Labour if it isthe custom of the Civil Liabilities Commission that,after allowing an annual Grant to a man on joining upas a private, on promotion his Grant is reduced by theamount of extra pay he receives on promotion; and, ifsuch is the case, will he take into his consideration the alteration of this practice, especially looking to the fact of the increased cost of living and that the custompenalises a man from striving to improve his position?Sir R. Home : It has always been the practice of theCivil Liabilities Department to review a Grant made toa private, on his promotion. The Grant is not, however,automatically reduced on account of his promotion, nor isit reduced by the whole amount of the extra pay whichaccrues on promotion. Each case is dealt with onits merits. I see no reason for altering the present practice. I may observe in this connection that no reduction of Grants from the Civil Liabilities Depart-ment has been made by reference to the bonus which isnow payable to men serving with the Armies of Occu-pation in addition to their ordinary pay.OFFICERS&apos; WIDOWS ALTERNATIVE PENSION.14th August, 1919.Lieutenant-Colonel Archer-Shee asked, the PensionsMinister whether, seeing that widows of officers whowere killed in the War and who applied for an alterna-tive pension a few days after the 12th February, 1919,have not been allowed to have their alternative pensionantedated to the date from the date upon which it became due, i.e., the date of their husbands&apos; death, andthat considerable hardship has been experienced by someofw these widows, who are deprived of the money dueto them solely by a Departmental rule of the Ministryof Pensions, he will have inquiry made into this matter?Sir L. Worthington-Evans: Delay in claiming analternative pension greatly increases the difficulties in-volved in ascertaining pre-war earnings, and thereforesome limit must be fixed for the period during whicharrears may be granted. Ordinarily, the limit is threemonths from the award of the fiat-rate pension. InNovember of last year the basis of the alternative pen-sion of officers&apos; widows was extended, and as a result alarge number of widows became eligible in respect ofofficers who had died some time previously. A periodof three months was allowed to enable these widows to acquaint themselves with the new provision, which was announced in Parliament and in the Press, and at the close of that period those who had not applied were treated in the same manner as widows who do not applywithin three months of the award of flat-rate pension that is, they are awarded alternative pension only fromthe date of application.Lieutenant-Colonel Archer-Shee: Is the right hon.Gentleman aware of the exceptional cases of officers&apos;widows in the Indian Army, who are suffering greathardship ^ because they had not the same opportunities of applying for the alternative pension? Is he alsoaware that there are many widows living in Englandwho were not aware that the pension could be obtained;and can he see his way to extending the time, so thatwidows who are entitled shall get the alternative pen-sion whether they applied in proper time or not?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : I cannot make any generalextension. I cannot believe that widows in Englandwere not fully cognisant of their rights. They wereadvertised on the food cards, which they must havehad, in the Press, and in Parliament.   If there are
exceptional cases arising from absence from this coun-try, I am prepared to look into them, but I cannotalter the general rule.TRAINING OP. OFFICERS (UNIVERSITY COURSE).Sir J. D. Rees asked the Lord Privy Seal whether,notwithstanding the critical- state of the country&apos;sfinances, 4,000 officers are to be sent to the universitiesat the expense of the taxpayer?The President of the Board of Education (Mr. HerbertFisher) : My right hon. Friend has asked me to answerthis question. Under the Government scheme for the assisted education of ex-Service officers and men, whichwas decided upon by the War Cabinet in December,1918, and publicly announced in the same month, grants are being made by the Board of Education&apos; for courses of higher education at universities, polytechnics, andother public educational institutions. I cannot say atpresent how many ex-officers and men will receive assist-ance under this scheme, but I am sure that the moneywill be well spent in the national interest.OFFICERS&apos; PENSIONS (COMMUTATION),Major Glyn asked the Financial Secretary to the WarOffice whether he is aware that the Army Order 3x6, of1914, which partially stopped commutation of officers&apos;pensions, has not been revoked; whether he proposesissuing a new Army Order to the effect that the com-mutation of officers&apos; pensions has been re-opened, and stating the conditions, so that officers about to retiremay know what are the official regulations now currentwhich govern commutation of pensions?Mr. Forster : A new Army Order, on the lines sug-gested, is about to be issued.Major Glyn asked the Financial Secretary to the WarOffice whether officers who retired before the amendedRegulations of 1919 became operative will, if they sodesire, be allowed to commute down to  80 a year orhalf their pension, seeing that  80 was the limit laiddown in the Royal Warrant for Pay, 1914, Article 514,as one of the conditions governing commutation ofpension ?Mr. Forster: The limit of  80 has been raised to 100 after careful consideration, and I am not preparedto make any change. There is no vested right in thematter, as the Royal Warrant states clearly that corn-mutations are subject to such conditions as may fromtime to time be laid down by the Army Council.DISABLED SERViCE MEN (TRAINING).15th August, 1919.i Major Entwistle asked the Minister of Labour whetherviolin making is included in the scheduled list of trades which come under the training schemes of the ministry for disabled soldiers and sailors; if not, what is thereason for the omission; whether a disabled soldier inreceipt of a disability pension who is being trained inviolin making can obtain from the Government the premium he has to pay for the training, an allowance for his tools, and separation allowance for his wife; and,if so, what steps he must take to obtain these benefits?Sir R. Home: Violin-making is included in theSchedule of special trades for the instruction of disabled ex-Service men. A disabled man placed in an approvedcourse of training in violin-making is eligible to receivemaintenance allowances upon the usual scale, and at the satisfactory completion of his training a kit of tools upto  10 in value. The Department will be prepared in special cases to pay a premium also, but the hon. Mem-ber will appreciate that generally the payment of pre-miums is undesirable. A disabled man requiring instruc-tion in violin-making with the allowances applicable tohis case should apply to the Divisional Director of indus-trial training for his area.SHELL-SHOCK AND NEURASTHENIA (TREATMENT).18th August, 1919.Sir L. Worthington-Evans (in reply to a question):Arrangements are being made to establish a neurologicalhospital in the South of Ireland for ex-Service men, atwhich scientific treatment for neurasthenia and shell-shock will be provided.MEN DISCHARGED UNFIT.Sir Ii. Cowan asked the Pensions Minister whetherwhere a man is discharged in consequence of medicalunfitness for further service, it is presumed that thecause of his unfitness was due to service unless there is good evidence to the contrary or that such unfitness was due to his own misconduct; whether medical refereesand Pensions Committees are required in dealing withsuch cases to base their decisions on this assumption;and whether due regard is paid to the same principle by Appeal Tribunals?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : The answer to all partsof the question is in the affirmative.DEPENDENTS OF SUICIDES.Mr. T. Wilson asked the Pensions Minister whetherthe widow and children of a soldier who has committedsuicide are, under any circumstances, entitled to cr are granted a pension or gratuity?Sir L. Worthington-Evans: If there is reasonableprobability that service has affected the man&apos;s mentalstate, ordinary pension is admitted; in other cases,where service had apparently little connection with theact, an Article 15 pension may be granted. The classesof case in which pension is entirely refused are few, andare for the most part those in which the suicide is com-mitted to avoid justice, or as a sequel to gross mis-conduct.CHILDLESS WIVES&apos; ALLOWANCE.Mr. Hogge asked the Pensions Minister whether thechildless wives flat-rate allowance of 6s. 6d. can be claimed with arrears from 1st November, 1918, althoughthe soldier&apos;s twenty-eight days&apos; furlough has expired?Sir L. Worthington-Evans: The answer is in the affirmative.MINISTRY OF PENSIONSCIRCULARS.August 14th, 1919. Circular 188.-Travelling expenses ofnear relatives of men undergoing treatment in Institutions.The question has been raised whether Local War Pensions Committeesmay pay the travelling expenses of relatives visiting disabled sailors,soldiers and airmen who are undergoing treatment in institutions underthe Regulations made by the Ministry.Although no general authority to defray such expenses can be given,the Minister is willing that, in the event of such a man&apos;s conditionbecoming critical, his nearest relative should be allowed the reasonablecost of travelling to visit him.Payment should be made by the Local Committee of the area in whichthe relative resides. The applicant should be required to produce aletter or telegram from the institution at which the man is undergoingtreatment, or otherwise reasonably to satisfy the Committee as to the facts.August 13th, 1919. Circular 189.-Alternative Pensions.Alteration in procedure relating to the assessment of earning capacity. England, Wales and Scotland only.&apos; With reference to paragraph 15 of the Instructions for the assessment of Alternative Pensions under which Local Committees are required, in suitable cases, to consult the Advisory Wages Boards with reference tothe ascertainment of an applicants earning capacity. These Boardswere only set up in a few districts and have now been dissolved. though their services were only utilised by a small number of Local Committees,the limited experience gained indicated that a local trade opinion was of great value in determining the difficult question of earning capacity.The functions of the Advisory Wages Boards, so far as they relate tocomplaints from disabled sailors, soldiers and airmen with regard to questions of employment, have been transferred to Local employment committees set up by the Ministry of Labour. A Local employment committees or Sub-Committee is attached to each Employment exchange and, in specialised industries, Technical Advisory Committees have beenformed, in some cases acting as Sub-Committees of the Local Employ-ment Committees. The machinery thus set up is comprehensive, and theconstitution of the Committees-which consist of representatives of em-ployers and employees, having intimate knowledge of rates of wagesand working conditions in their respective districts-appears to render them suitable bodies to advise as to the earning capacity of disabledmen who apply for Alternative Pensions and who are in, or are suitedfor, employment.
1   253^ October, 1919. War Pensions Gazette 395Arrangements have, accordingly, been made with the Ministry ofLabour whereby the Local Employment Committees will undertake this duty in future or will arrange for it to be undertaken by the appropriateorganisation in certain industries. Paragraph 15 of the Instructions forthe Assessment of alternative Pensions should, therefore, be amended by the substitution of Local Employment Committee for the AdvisoryWages Board. These arrangements will come into force on the 18thAugust, 1919, and, as from that date, the procedure set out below shouldbe strictly observed. The arrangements will be provisional in the firstinstance and will be reviewed later in the light of the experience gained.(i.) Cases to be referred to Local Employment Committees.The advice of the Local Employment Committee should be sought inall cases except the following: (a) Men who are in receipt of Disablement Pension for the highestdegree of disablement and are not earning in fact, and who, in theopinion of the Medical Referee and of the Local Committee,have no earning capacity at the moment, whether at light orordinary employment.(b) Men who are found by the Medical Referee to be in a con-dition unfitting them for work and to be in need of treatment.(c) Men who are working, and who, in the opinion of the LocalCommittee, are receiving appropriate remuneration for the workthey are doing, are exercising to the full their earning capacity,and could not with advantage be trained for another occupation.In cases under (c) care must be taken to refer to the Local Employ-ment Committee, if there is any doubt; and, in any case, the Ministrymay, on considering the claim and before making an award, require theLocal Committee to obtain the advice of the Local Employment Com-mittee.(II.) Procedure in referring cases.The applicant should be examined by the Medical Referee and if thecase is found to be one which should be referred to the Local Employ-ment Committee, the applicant should be notified accordingly (on FormA.P.56) and the Local Employment Committee should be asked (on FormA.P.57) to advise as to his earning capacity. The Local employment committees will report on the second part of the latter form.Care must be taken to furnish the Medical Referee and the local employment Committee with full and accurate information respecting the disability on account of which the man has been pensioned, as, in estimating earning capacity, regard cannot be had to the effect of adisability not officially recognised as connected with the man&apos;s service.It is important also that the Local Employment Committee should be furnished with all the information it is possible to obtain before the hearing with regard to the man&apos;s pre-war occupation and earnings see (IV.) below.The pensioner and the Local War Pensions Committee will be notifiedby the Secretary of the Local Employment Committee of the date when the case will be heard, and it will be open to the Local WarPensions Committee to depute a representative to attend the hearing.The pensioner may call witnesses on his behalf, whose expenses, inaccordance with the Ministry of Labour&apos;s authorised scale, may be paidif the person presiding at the meeting certifies that the attendance ofthe witnesses was necessary to the hearing. Such payments will be madeby the Ministry of Labour. No expenses can be allowed in respect ofthe pensioners own attendance.(III.) Submission of Claim to Ministry.The Report of the Local Employment Committee must be forwarded to the Ministry with the claim to Alternative Pension.The Local Employment Committee will not assess the man&apos;s earning capacity with reference to the facilities for employment existing in hisdistrict, but will advise solely as to the amount he is to be deemedcapable of earning in a suitable occupation if a post were available.Care must be taken to see that this basis of assessment lias beenadopted, and the Local War Pensions Committee, in forwarding theclaim to the Ministry, should indicate :n what respect, if at all, theydissent from the finding of the Local Employment Committee.(IV.) Miscellaneous.In view of the great importance which is attached to a prompt settle-ment of claims to Alternative Pension, every effort must be made tosecure that the reference to the Local Employment Committee does not materially delay a decision. The pre-war earnings and present earnings, ifany, should be investigated by the Inquiry Officer while the case is under reference to the Local Employment Committee. The facts so ascertainedwill, however, be of great assistance to the Local Employment Com-mittee, and as soon as the hearing is fixed the Inquiry Officer shouldbe asked to complete his investigation and furnish his report, if possible,in time for communication to the Local Employment Committee, or if heis unable to report fully within the time available to send in a state-ment of all the facts he has ascertained.It will be open to the Local Employment Committee to recommenda course of training.Where the Rules of the Committee permit, District or Sub-committees should be empowered to refer cases to the appropriate Local Employ-ment Committee.The Manager of the Employment Exchange is the Secretary of theLocal Employment Committee and, in places where there is no Employ-ment Exchange, the request for advice should be addressed to the local employment Committee at the Employment Exchange nearest the pen-sioner&apos;s residence.Circular 190 has been held up.September 15th, 1919,   Circular 191.-Duties and Responsi-bilities of Treasurers of Local War Pensions Committees.With reference to paragraphs 11 (1) and (2) of the War Pensions(Proceedings of Committees) Regulations, 1919, the question has beenunder consideration as to what action should be taken by a Treasurer(or Finance Officer) of a War Pensions Committee who is directed tomake a payment which he considers to be outside the Regulations ofthe Ministry.In such a case the Treasurer should represent his objection, andthe reason for it, in writing, to the Chairman of the meeting at whichthe award was made, and decline to make the payment except on aspecial written and signed direction of the Chairman. If the Treasurerreceives such a written direction, which makes the signatory personallyresponsible for the payment, he should make the payment and imme-diately report the facts to the headquarters of the Region, or, in any casein which the Regional organisation is not yet constituted, to the head-quarters of the Ministry.This restriction of the powers of a Committee corresponds to thefinancial restrictions placed on the Minister, whose Accounting Officermay protest in writing against a payment which he considers outsidethe Ministers powers. In such a case the Minister may disregard the written protest of his Accounting Officer and may direct in writing thatthe payment should be made, but he is held personally responsible forthe payment. In these circumstances, it will be seen that any restrictionplaced on the powers of the Minister must follow any delegation ofthem to others.QUESTIONS AND  ANSWERS.Q. 271. A. man in receipt of a disablement pensionhas been recommended massage by a Medical Board.He works about 2^ miles from the V.A.D. Hospital,and loses  1 in wages by attending on three after-noons weekly. Under Royal Warrant we cannot exceed10s. weekly for loss of time. What would be the bestprocedure in this case?A. If arrangements cannot be made for the pensioner toattend for treatment in the evening, the Local Committee should endeavour to secure the services of a qualified local Masseuror Masseuse to give the treatment in the man&apos;s home. Thescale of fees, if in excess of schedule rates, must be submittedto the C.M.S.for sanction.Q. 272. A man is in receipt of pension for an ampu-tated leg, and is appealing for different disability underArticle 9 of the Royal Warrant. He has been before theMedical Referee, who considers the disability attributable to service, and has assessed the pension. Are advances to be made of the difference between the present pension and pension as assessed by the Medical Referee, and theman retain his ring paper, or should the ring paper be* taken and pension advanced to the amount of theReferee&apos;s assessment?A. The Local Committee should make advances of thedifference between the present pension and the pensionassessed by the Medical Referee [see Circular j6\Q- 273.-If a man has put in an appeal, and advancesare being made under Circular 178, can tram or railwayfares necessary for the man to undergo treatment bepaid, and, if so, are they to be coded D.S. 7, or madeas advances?A.

At the outbreak of war I was serving in theRegular Army on the Indian Unattached List. I wasinvalided from India in June, 1917, and dischargedphysically unfit, and am now receiving a Service pension of 19s. 3d. a week and a Partial Disablement Pension(conditional) of 13s. gd. a week. Can I have this made into an Alternative Pension, and, if so, what would Igain? My pay in India was  % 6s. 8d. per month,consolidated, with free quarters, etc.
A. An alternative, pension to a disabled man represents the difference behveen pre-war earnings and present earning capacity. In the case of Regular soldiers serving at Indianor Colonial Stations at the outbreak of war, and in receipt ofIndian or Colonial rates of pay, the pre-war earnings arecomputed from the pay and allowances of a man \ of equivalent rank serving at home. It is not possible to say whether an alternative pension would be more advantageousin this specific instance, as [this would depend upon the effecton earning capacity of the disablement for which pensioned.If in any doubt, an application should be made throughlheL.W.P.C.Q. 277, Can a young demobilised soldier, who is anxious to start a carrier business, and support himseliand aged parents, obtain financial assistance to enable him to purchase the necessary outfit?A.

In the case of re-marriageafter the 2nd September, 1919, the amount of the gratuitywill be determined by the rank of the deceased husband,and the age of the widow according to the scale given inreply to Question 280.Q. 285.*-Are all advances under Part 11. regulations and Circulars 45, 178 and 179 to be granted on the new rates ?A. As from the yd September, 1919, all advanceswhich Local Committees are authorised to make in anticipa-tionof an award of pension will be at the new rates.Q. 286.*-With regard to treatment allowances it is110^ quite clear from the fourth paragraph of the Circularwhether the Committee should continue payment on thepresent rates pending further instructions or whetherthey are at liberty to apply forthwith on September 3rdwithout supplements the new 100 per cent, rates, dis-regarding the. date of marriage for the purpose of the married woman&apos;s allowance and the date of birth inrespect of children&apos;s allowances where the man is on home or out-patient treatment and living at home andsubstituting a wife&apos;s separation allowance equal to naiftotal disablement rate for the married woman&apos;s allow-ance in the case of an in-patient or patient living away from home, charging a sum of 7s. against the patient&apos;sweekly allowance towards the cost of his maintenance,as at present. Should the new rates be applicable onthese lines, it is presumed that dependents&apos; allowancesunder Article 6 (1) (a) may be increased by doubling the present bonus.A. The new treatment allowances are fidly explained inthe Advance Circular, dated the 2W1 August, as amended bythe Circular, dated the loth September. As regards allow-ances for dependents, it has further been decided that theamount of ascertained dependence [referred to inC.2[b) (111),i.e., in the \oth line on page 5 of the Circular of 2&amp;thAugust), may be increased 20 per cent.Q. 287.*-Mother and sister of soldier who enlisted atthe outbreak of war drew reparation allowance of 17/6.The Pensions Officer assessed dependency at 18/-.

&apos;   254APPENDIX XI.MINISTRY^? PENSIONS.&apos;Gen/l59. &quot;       &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;(Press Notice)The Minister of Pensions announces that the following arrangements have been made to mitigate the hardships to pensioners and disabled men arising from the strike:-The Appeal Tribunals will not sit until further noticeas neither &apos;the judges nor the disabled men can reach the tribunals and because of the difficulty in the transit of documents, etc.The payment of existing pensions will continue for theremainder of tho 13 weeks for which payment books are currentat the Post Offices.   Over 25,000 renewal books are issuedeach week.New books will be issued to take the place of existingbooks though there may be delay in the distribution to and through the Post Offices.Normally some 16,000 men are medically examined each week to decide whether an existing pension is to be renewedand if so at what rate.It is obvious that many of the Boards will not be abletc meet.Men who have received notices to attend Boards should&apos;doso if they can;   steps will, however, be taken to renew existingpensions at present rates temporarily without a further Board,and books for payment will be issued so far as is possible.There are about 12,000 new claims for pension for thefirst time each week.   Every endeavour will be made to concentrate the awarding staff on these cases and provisional awards will bemade on the best evidence obtainable, subject to revision whenBoarding again becomes possible in all cases.It Is hardly possible that any prolonged interruption ofcommunication between the Headquarters of the Ministry, the regions, the Local War Pensions- Comnittees and the Record offices and the difficulties caused to the staffs (any of whom, live at considerable distances from tho offices) and In the transit of documents, can fail to cause great delays.   These delays may meanserious postponements in payments.Snergeney instructions have been issued to Local WarPensions Committees authorising advances of pension when necessary.    Pensioners and claimants for pensions should ;therefore communicate with their Local war Pensions Committees   /and net with the Headquarters of the Ministry in London.The Local War Pensions Committees may have difficultyin identifying some claimants.   The leading Societies of Ex-Service men have promised to give such assistance as is intheir power to the Local uar Pensions Committees.

In these days, when organised labour is making a bid for thesupport of the discharged sailor and soldier, it is interesting to note the attitude of industrial organisationstowards vocational training of the returned men.   Officials of bodies who concern themselves with the care of the soldier,and are conscientiously striving to secure him a remunerativeposition in civil life, have not fiouiid the union officialhelpful in this regard.   His attitude has generally been thatthe disabled soldier should be trained for some new calling.&quot;Tro-in the poor chap by all means.   He thoroughly deserves help-But don&apos;t train him for the trade our union members follow.We don&apos;t want any more men in our trade.&quot;   That has been theposition taken up, not hy one union only, but by many.   Thebright exception has been the boot trade employees&apos; organisa-tion.   That body not only encouraged the training of, andfinding of positions for returned men, but voted  50 from itsfunds towards the cost of vocational training classes.   Corn-plaints have recently been made that while the Repatriationdepartment is training men in the manufacture of electroplatedware, no employment can be found for the men when they becomeefficient.   The manufacturers&apos; community were consulted beforethe classes were commenced.   Their replies were to the effectthat positions could be found in the industry in Melbourne andSydney for 100 men if they were competent tradesmen.&quot;The Argus.

&apos;   258APPENDIX XV.AUSTRALIA; Education of Soldiers^OrphansSchemes for the education of the orphans of australian soldiers have been considered by a jointcommittee representing the Returned Soldiers1 League,the Sailors and Soldiers1 Fathers&apos; Association, and thoFriendly Union of Wives and Mothers.     The desire of thecommittee is the creation of machinery which will securethe educational training, technical and otherwise,of thechildren of all deceased soldiers until   they are fitted to obtain positions in life.     Those who are working forthe scheme, contend that vhere ,such children require vocational training it should be automatically secured for them as aright,  aid without any suggestion of charity.,     They recognisethat only certain of the children will be fitted intellectuallyto follow up such higher education as can be given attechnical colleges, agricultural colleges, high and secondary schools, commercial colleges, and the University.Many may be so placed as to be unable to take advantage ofsuch courses,   A draft scheme has been drawn up and placed before the Minister of Repatriation, suggesting lines onwhich the education of these orphans may be carried out.  -Argus, July 29th, 1919.
a PPENDl X   XVI2 5CANADA: IMPERIAL PENSIONERS AND CANADIAN RATES*IPeeling that the particular questions effectingthem could better be dealt with in a separate organisation,the Imperial Veterans of Canada have withdrawn from theGreat War Veterans Associations and have formed a separateassociation^Tho new association has set out to obtainredress of many serious grievances and omissions affectingtheir members.   Pensions, vocational training, pay,disablement allowances and many other matters will be taken up without delay.     For some time an agitation has been going on to obtain for Imperials tho same pensions and gratuities and, in fact, all advantages enjoyed byCanadian veterans,The pension of tho widow of a private in theImperials, resident in Canada, amounts to approximately$15 a month, and $1.50 for the first child/$l,25 for thesecond,  end $1 for the third and subsequent.     This isnot considered nearly adequato9     No action has beentaken as yet by the&apos;Canadian Government with regard topensions, but it is understood that, at the next session ofparliament, pensions on the same scale as Canadians willbe granted to widows of Imperials,   Total disablementallowance for Imperials in Canada amounts to about $22 amonth, which is considerably below the present Canadianscale,The scale of vocational training nay at present,makes it almost impossible for an Imperial without privatemeans to take a course.     The pay amounts to p6,,50 a week for a man, with $3.25 added for his wife, and tl for each child.     Should ho become sick while undergoing a course$1.75 is deducted from this sum.   Under such conditions,it is stated, many Imperials are debarred from participating in the advantages of vocational training.Imperials urge that there should be established in Canada, a section of tho pensions Board or other government department to deal with their cases,-, and that arepresentative should be established in British Columbiawho could deal with these urgent matters,,   &apos; It isestimated that In Vancouver alone, there are ever 2rQ0OImperial veterans,  Mile in the whole province there are probably another thousand,tThe Vancouver Daily Province, July 23th., 1919,
APPENDIX XVII,\m 2EALAWD; SPECIAL MLDIJAL BOlBS) FOu ADVICE to disabled SOLDIERS.The medical branch of the Defence Department has appointed a special medical board for the purpose of examiningall soldiers who are out-patients at all hospitals in NewZealand.   This board will travel over the whole of New Zealandwith a view to classifying these cases.   In addition to returnedsoldiers actually attending as out-patients, it is believed thatthere may be some disabled men who received their discharge beforethe possibilities opened up by the recent advances in militaryorthopaedic surgery and other kinds of treatment of war disabilit-ies had developed.   Any disabled men in this condition, whodesire their cases to be reviewed by the travelling medical board, can apply for examination.Cases requiring treatment will be sent to the mostsuitable hospital for in-patient treatment,, so that they may getgreater benefit-   Other out-patients have reached a stationaryposition in regard to their disability, and where the board is satisfied that no further good can be done, they will be boardedout, and their pension finally aafjusted.As the Defence Department has now a complete seriesof hospitals for specialist treatment, the medical board will beable, in many cases, to recommend transfers of patients to thehospital in which their particular disability will be dealt withby a specially trained staff.   Soldier patients in the civilhospitals are to be-included In this examination.   The board will make a special note regarding limbless cases and thoserequiring operative treatment.   Every&apos;patient will have his case considered, with a view to providing him with thebest treatment available in the Dominion.The policy of the Department is not to allow itssoldier patients to drift indefinitely.   The Board comprisesa consulting surgeon to the forces, and a surgeon who has hada wile experience on a hospital ship and in military hospitals.It. will be able to determine what can be done to improve thecondition of the patient, and to decide definitely if nothingfurther can be done by medical science, in which case the soldier will have his pension permanently arranged, and willbe able to take advantage of the facilities provided by theState for the assistance of disabled men to learn specialoccupations suitable for them.   It is anticipated that this board will require several months to complete its itinerary.It is hoped that any discharged soldiers on permanentpension who consider they may be benefited by further treat-lent will report.   This will clearly be entirely to their.1advantage, as although their physical condition may be improved&apos;, &quot;their pension, if already made permanent, cannot be.reduced.The Auckland Weekly News, July 3rd./ 1919.
