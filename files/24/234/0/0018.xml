THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.  9CP.  368 (32).CABINET.MEAT POLICY.          Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.     1.  I WAS instructed in Cabinet Conclusion S (c), Cabinet 55 (32), to submit a memorandum outlining a meat policy.  I have  agreed  with  the  Secretary ofState  for  Scotland  to put  forward  the following- observations  on my ownresjjonsibility,  though the Scottish  Department  of Agriculture is,  of  course,closely concerned in the matter and is being kept in touch.     2.  The Cabinet  Committee  on  Commercial Negotiations with ForeignCountries has given preliminary consideration to  the position  of home agricul-ture.  No formal decisions have yet  been  reached, but I think it is true to saythat the general feeling of the Committee is that our agricultural policy should aim at the stabilisation of market conditions while providing opportunity for areasonable expansion of home production.     3.  Beef. The proportion of home to total supplies was 55 per cent, beforethe War and is 44 per cent, to-day.  I should tentatively suggest that an ultimate proportion of home beef production not less than that of before the War shouldbe allowed for in our general policy.     4.  Mxitton and  Lamb. The proportion of  home to total  supplies was52 per cent, before the  War (1911-12), and is 38 per cent, to-day.  It is doubtful,in view of the very large expansion in Dominion sheep stocks, whether the home producer can regain even the  proportion of the home market which he enjoyedbefore the War, but I should  again  suggest that this quantity should be eitheraimed at, or  allowed for,  in any computation of  our total  meat  import requirements.     5.  Bacon. The Lane-Fox report has incurred criticism in respect of the diminution it suggests  in foreign supplies of bacon.  It  should be noted that thereport only proposes that, three years from next July, instead of taking fths ofour bacon supply from abroad, we should  take frds from abroad, providing ^rdonly from home sources. From Denmark we are now taking double the bacon andham we took five years  ago, and in the last two years over 9 per cent, per annumof our total imports have come, for instance, from the  Vistula. Basin, a sourcewhich previously scarcely figured in our trade returns for this commodity at all.I should tentatively suggest that the Report fulfils  the conditions of paragraph above as far as quantities are concerned, and might  be  adopted, subject,  ofcourse, to any arrangements come to in the discussions now proceeding betweenthe Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture.     6.  Discussion of a desirable ultimate expansion of home meat production,however, is at the present moment entirely hypothetical.  The following  figuresspeak for themselves.   They are taken out for the London Smithfield Market,      [7787]
which may be regarded as q fair barometer of meat price movements for the wholeof the country :    Smithfield Prices: Average max.-min. -per lb. of English Long Sides Beef.             June 1932     ....       ....       ....       ....     S-fr,d.             October 10    ....       ....       ....       ....     [&apos;v\d.   -  &quot;     &quot;  *&apos;   -    17,. ............       ....       .....     6A(/..    .                     24........       ....    &apos;5\m                     27             ....       ....       ....   ^5hd.Thus, this commodity price has fallen 33 per cent, since June, and 12^ per cent, inthe last three weeks.  The British meat markets, central and local, are at presentshowing every sign of saturation weak selling, throw-away prices (good breastsof mutton have been cleared at \d. per 8 lbs. to the soap-boilers), and a reluctance of the  market  here and there  to  accept  supplies  at  any price.   In  thesecircumstances,  the fall  is becoming accentuated, and  to-dav&apos;s Smithfield  pricesshow a further decline to 5\d.     7.  This fall has not been caused by the home producer pushing forwardsupplies to take advantage of the suspension of Irish shipments.  The position.compared with previous years, is as follows : Arrivals oJ Fat Cattle on certain  representative markets in England and Wales.                    (Fourteen  weeks, July  24-October 26.)                             1929       1930.       1931.       1932.         FatCattle   ...     132,168     121.005    121.930    125.009There is thus no reason to expect that marketings from home sources will be lessthan usual in the ensuing months.  Indeed, certain observers state that, as  mightbe expected,  stronger holders are retaining  what  they can, for the time  being,hoping for an upward turn in prices.  Home marketings for the next few months will, in fact,  be abnormally heavy.     8.  The  essential feature of the situation is a saturation of the  meat marketas a whole, and this has come about, not as the result of a sudden flinging on themarket of excessive  supplies, but from a combination of circumstances notably,in the last year or two, a phenomenal increase in imports of mutton and lamband  pig-meat whose effects were already becoming manifest when the &quot;british delegation went to Ottawa, but which have since become acute.     9.  Over this already saturated market  hangs a further source of supply,which is absolutely  bound to discharge itself before the Winter is far advanced.Since the imposition of the 20  per cent, ad valorem duty on live-stock from theIrish Free State,&quot; about 40,9,00 fewer fat cattle and 60,000 fewer store cattle have entered the ports of Great Britain from Ireland than in previous years over thesame  period.   At  a  conservative  estimate,  between  120,000  and  150,000well-finished fat cattle,  or about 60,000 more than normal, can be expected toarrive in this country from Ireland before Christmas.  There is no pthjjr, marketavailable for them, and there are only limited facilities for  winter feeding in theFree State.   With the aid of the export bounty  they are coming freely now.     10.  Under the Ottawa arrangements, the total reduction  of meat supplies(excluding pig-meat) in 1933 amounts to just over 1 per cent, of the supplies inthe&apos;  Ottawa standard year ended June 1932.   The Lane-Fox Report proposes asubstantial&apos; cut&apos;in. liacon&apos;. but this will not  be enforced till July  1933.   It -istherefore reasonable to say that, for the next twelve months, the flooding  of themarket under  present  arrangements is bound  to continue.  What levels meatprices&quot; might reach during that time is a matter of conjecture.  A large Englishbuyer whom I  consulted said that English fat  stock at certain  times and  placeswould become &quot; unsaleable.&quot;  The repercussion  of such an event on, for instance,institutional revenues and agricultural mortgages, requires  no emphasis, and thiswould be&apos;really of minor importance compared with the effect on farming capital,a great proportion of which would be destroyed.        :
    11.  I do not think this situation should be allowed to proceed to its logical-conclusion.  By causing a progressive loss of capital, the downward price niove-ments at present continuing would ruin a proportion of the English feeders, andwould eventually produce the ruin of many  of the store-stock breeders, and  thusbring about the limitation of home supply.   This would take certainly more thana year before it  could become effective.  Meanwhile, the overseas producers,  bothDominion and foreign, in  throwing supplies on a market which  is still on the downward trend after having fallen 33 per cent,  in five months, would not succeed in obtaining that improved  purchasing power which it is the desire of all of usto see them obtain.    12.  The supplies at present saturating the market are of  two kinds freshmeat and &quot;preserved&quot; meat.  The  recent increases have all taken place in thesecond category, among which may be mentioned a  50 per cent, increase  over pre-War imports in the case of frozen mutton and lamb, a 40 per cent, increasein imported beef, and 100 per cent, increase in imported bacon.  It seems that some further regulation and limitation of the supplies on this market must be under-taken either by voluntary or by legislative means or, better, by a combination of both.In such measures it would seem impossible  to avoid  the conclusion that the first-section of the supplies to be regulated and limited  should be  the &quot; preserved &quot;supplies.  These supplies, in addition to being preservable, are, apart from bacon.under the control of a few large  firms and are brought in special ships.  Thesemeat supplies, both chilled and frozen, are, I submit, the first point at which that further control  should be exerted, which the facts above recited  seem to makeinevitable.    13.  I ask,  therefore, that authority should be given to the Board of Trade,together with the two Departments of Agriculture, to call together the heads ofthe import meat trade, and seek to  arrange  with them such  limitation of therelease of supplies as may be necessary to stem the collapse of  the meat marketsnow in  progress, and, if possible, to lift meat  prices to some  reasonable figure(no doubt short  of that of  June 1932).  In this review the Irish imports wouldnlso be included.    14.   Similarly, I suggest discussion should be opened forthwith with theAustralian contractors for frozen  beef to,  the  Forces, asking them  to  allow a two months&apos; &quot;gap &quot; (November-December 1932) in their deliveries, the &quot;&quot;gap &quot;to be made good by home meat.   It is possible that this arrangement would not be wholly disadvantageous  to  the Australian  contractors,  and could be  so put tothem.   The fall in prices has made the extra cost now a relatively small matter.    15.   It may be possible to obtain the general restriction by voluntary agree-ment, as  it is undoubtedly to the  ultimate interest  of the overseas producers,though  to a lesser degree than that  of the home producers.  I cannot, however,conceal my conviction that, in  view of the extreme weakness of the market,  andthe very short time within which action, if  it is to be effective, must be taken, itmay be necessary to have, in reserve, powers such as  are being taken in  the  Billto enforce the Ottawa Agreements.   These would perhaps require a short specialBill.  This would, of course, require to be  passed before the end  of the present session.   The Chief Whip  informs me that, if necessary, time could be made forsuch a measure.    16.  I should  regard  all  these as purely emergency  measures and shouldjustify them solely on account  of the conditions of disorganisation  appearing onthe London meat market.  I should ask that forthwith we should appoint a MeatReorganisation  Commission to  study the position of the home producer.  I should further ask that the Meat Conference of 1933 should  be pushed for\yaVd.as early as possible in next year, say, to April, or even  to March,  for  which, at  least an interim report of the Meat Commission would  be available.  I should .ask that foreign as well  as home and Dominion meat producers should  be invited to  this conference.  They would be asked not in order  to assist at a new demonstration-of economic nationalism, but to co-operate in the organisation of one of the greatworld  markets,  temporarily glutted with  supplies.  I have  read ^with  greatsympathy  the  Report  of  the Prime  Ministers Committee  on  international economic Policy (CP. 361 (32) circulated on  the.27th  October);, and I  alsoappreciate to the full the tremendous difficulty  with which  the President of theBoard of Trade, in particular, is faced in contemplating proposals such  as those
above outlined.   I  can  only say that I have  been  driven  reluctantly to these conclusions by the facts of  the case.   The alternative is not to allow things toremain as they are.  The alternative is to take exactly the same course,  by the pressure  of economic circumstances,  some  time early  in  next year,  when  the damage which we may possibly  now avert at home has been irretrievably done.and &quot;when the repercussion on foreign countries and on our overseas trade will still be as great, or greater.    1.  A reasonable  proportion for  the home  producer in the meat marketmight be reg&quot;arded as 50/50, to be reached after  a period of years.    2.  This, however, is hypothetical, since the meat market is showing signsof collapse and beef prices have fallen  by 33 per cent,  in five months.    3.  Some regulation of supplies beyond the  Ottawa arrangements, both intime and quantity, can scarcely  be avoided.  This regulation would require toinclude  Irish supplies.    4.  The regulation would be, for the present, of an emergency character,extending only until the situation could be reviewed by the Meat Conference in,say, April.    5.  The regulation should be, as far as possible, by voluntary arrangements,but the  possible necessity for reserve powers, involving legislation, should not be overlooked.    6.  Australian contractors should be invited  to accept a two months&apos; gap intheir deliveries to the Forces, the gap to be filled  by home supplies.    7.  A Meat  Commission for the problem of the home producer should beappointed  forthwith.   Its  interim  report would  be  available for the  Meat.Conference.    8.  The Meat Conference would include representatives from  all suppliers.of our markets, foreign as well as home and  Dominion.CONCLUSIONS.(Initialled)W. E.
