Summary of  Reports made  to  the Board  of  Trade              Advisory Council in connection with their  meeting              on October 13th, 1932 (supplemented in  some  cases                     v/ith information from other  sources^.         Employment.- Insured workers in employment at the end of     September were  estimated to number 48,000 less than  a  month     earlier;  if, however,  the persons directly  involved in trade     disputes were omitted from the account  the figures would  show an     increase of 37,000.   The total number of persons  on  the     registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain decreased  in     the  same period by 1,800.   The most  important industries  in which     improvements (mostly seasonal) were  shown were coal  mining,     woollen and worsted, and hosiery and motor vehicle manufacture     and  the boot and shoe industry;  on  the other hand there  were     declines (  also largely seasonal) in the distributive  trades  and                                                  0     in the  hotel and boarding house services and in the  building     industry.    In  London,  Southern England and  in Scotland     unemployment increased; in other districts ( particularly in  the     North Eastern Division  of England and in Wales) the  situation was     more favourable than a  month ago.         Overseas Trade - In September the  excess of  imports  over     exports of  merchandise  was  25.1 million or   9.5  million  less     than in the corresponding month of last  ear. In the  9 months     ended September 1932 compared with the  corresponding period of     1931 imports of manufactured articles declined by  69.5 million;     exports of  similar goods of United Kingdom production  declined by      14.2 million.         Rail  and Road Traffic - Compared with the corresponding     period  of  1931  and receipts from railway traffic  of  the four     amalgamated companies for the 5 weeks ended  2nd October showed a
decrease of  1,744,000 ( or 11.14$).  The percentage decreases in passenger traffic;  coal, coke and patent fuel traffic; andother freight traffic were 5.41, 13.07 and 17.45 respectively.     New registrations in August of motor cars taxed on horse-power showed an increase of 2,508 (or 4=5*2%) compared with august 1931;  newly registered motor cycles showed an increaseof 131 (or 4%) in the same period.     Coal-Mining - The average weekly output of coal for the13 weeks ended 24th September was 3,583,000 tons or 8.86 per cent.less than in the corresponding period of last year.   The average number of persons employed in the industry during the same periodof 1932 was 781,600, a decline of 43,700 compared with thecorresponding period of 1931.  Exports of coal during Septemberamounted to 2,824,000 tons or 760,000 tons less than inSeptember 1931.   In Northumberland, Durham andJjicotland, however,fairly substantial orders have recently been obtained from Sweden,Denmark and Finland, but in South Wales there has been a slightfalling off in the demand.   The inland trade generally was veryquiet.     Iron and Steel - The output in September of pig iron andingot steel was 260,400 tons and 430,300 tons respectivelycompared with 248,200 tons and 400,500 tons respectively in thecorresponding month of last year.     The Imports of iron and steel&apos; and manufactures thereof inSeptember amounted to 107,000 tons - a aecrease of 113,000 tons compared with September 1931.  Comparative figures of exportsof similar goods of United Kingdom production showed a decrease of12,000 tons in September 1932.   Export markets are still handi-capped by Exchange difficulties.  The Tariff on Continental pigiron has been effective and competition from that source practicallyceased.  The recent advance in prices of Continental semi-finished.steel was maintained but there were few orders on the market.
A slight Improvement in the pig-iron market was reported from the North-^ast coast &quot;but that improvement did not extend to Scotland where, in the case of steel works, the positiondeteriorated.  In  Vales there was a modest revival in thetinplate trade hut the makers of black or galvanised sheetsand of heavy steel suffered from a continued scarcity oforders.     Shipping and Shipbuilding - The official freight indexfigure showed an upward movement from 75 in August to 81 in September - due apparently to a temporary improvement in thehomeward grain market from Canada;  a considerable amount ofchartering took place but there was no material increase inthe rate of freight.  The outward market remained practicallyunchanged.  Laid-up tonnage throughout the world is in theneighbourhood of 15 million tons (gross).  A few vessels forcoasting trade were contracted for.  The most recent returns of Lloyds&apos; show that the total tonnage in the worJLd under construction was about 901,000 tons, of which 238,000 tons werebeing built in the United Kingdom.  These figures areexclusive of Naval orders but these will not be of immediatehelp to the industry.     Machine Tools - Machine tools of United Kingdom manu-facture to the value of  2,465,000 were exported during the 9months ended in September compared with  1,892,000 in thecorresponding period of last year.   Russia continued to be theprincipal market for such tools, taking during last August about80% of the total shipments from this country.     Electrical Industry - The lighter side of the industryoperated at from 50 to 60 per cent, of capacity;  the heavierside at from 40 to 50 per cent.  The index of home ordersduring September rose to 60 compared with 56 in August - anincrease which was mainly due to re-construction work;  for
export orders there was a decline from 68 in August to 66 inSeptember, hut the total index for home and export tradeincreased to 56, a rise of 2 points over the figure for August,The consumption of electricity during September, was 5,4$greater than in September, 1931j  the increase during the first9 months of 1932 over the corresponding period of 1931 was.1*.     Motor Industry - Compared with July the home market formotor cars improved substantially in September, particularly for cars of low horse powerj  a decline in the demand for the heavier types of commercial vehicles was attributed to ananticipation of legislation following the publication of theSalter report on rail and road transport;  for light weighttrucks the demand was fairly steady.     The numbers of private cars (including cabs) exported inthe periods January-September, 1930, 1931 and 1932 were 13,700,11,400 and 16,600 respectively.     Cotton - The dispute in the weaving section of theindustry caused a sharp increase in -unemployment during september in the spinning and finishing sections;  this was accompanied by a steady decline in yarn production, whichtouched the lowest level since the beginning of 1931.   A fairamount of business was however placed in anticipation of thesettlement of the dispute and the general situation was, on thewhole, more satisfactory than the figures of production endunemployment would suggest.   The prospect of a somewhatlarger cotton crop in the United States than was anticipated amonth ago caused a slight fall in the prices of raw cotton, butthe decline was not sufficient to cause any serious restriction of business.   The prices of yarns were also firmer than theyhave been for some time and spinners&apos; margins showed animprovement.   Exports of piece goods which were lower in
K; 6 X.August than in July declined still further in September butthe fall, in view of the dislocation in the weaving section,was not regarded as excessive.   In the home market there wssa reduction in the demand for piece goods.     Wool - The new Australian and South African &quot;clips&quot; weremoving satisfactorily and wool prices, though irregular, bothin the primary markets and in London showed a gain comparedwith the lowest point in the summer.   Compared with the average for 1913 (figures which may be taken as representative of pre-war prices) wools were recently selling in London at prices which showed a decline of from 20 to 25 per cent, in the caseof merinos, and from 25 to 50% in the case of crossbreds.Machinery activity improved slightly, mainly in the earlyprocesses, but the industry as a whole continued to sufferconsiderably from unemployment.   The home market was quiet.Compared with the corresponding period of last year the exports of wool tops of United Kingdom manufacture increasec&quot;. inJanuary-September, 1932, by over  700,000 in value.;  in the same                                                 Operiod however the exports of woollen and worsted manufacturesshowed, a decline in value.     Silk and Artificial Silk - The maintenance of the higher prices for raw silk had the effect of making buyers hold back.In the throwing section of the industry employment was good;in the manufacturing section the machinery was only partiallyemployed;  slight improvements were reported in the making-up,knitting and small wares sections.   The spun silk trade wasdepressed and continued to run at less than half capacity.     Other Industries - The building and building materialsindustries were affected by the decreased expenditure ofpublic authorities and were in a somewhat depressed condition.Deliveries of chemicals during September showed a slightimprovement but the third quarter of the year did not compare
favourably with the first half of the year;  there was anincrease in the demand for dyestuffs for foreign markets;business in pharmaceutical products was fairly satisfactory.In the boot and shoe industry seasonal improvements were reported from several of the manufacturing centres but generally speakingthe demand was much below oapacity;  in the retail trade business was dull.   Production figures for August (643,000 doz.&apos; pairs)showed an increase of over 10,000 doz. pairs compared with august 1931.   During August there was a general decrease in thedemand for soap but a slight improvement set in during September;the seed crushing industry was quiet, as usual at this time ofthe yoar.   The motor tyre trade showed little change comparedwith the corresponding period of last year, although a greater proportion was taken by manufacturers;   a decline in the demandfor motor cycle tyres was set off by an increased demand fortyres for pedel cycles.   Foreign competition for rubber footwearwas felt keenly both in the home and overseas markets.     The wheat Situation - The Canudian crop, of which b ottPquantity and quality are satisfactory, was exported freely;  theposition, so far as shipments were concerned, was considered tobe the best that the Dominion has held since 192S, due mainly tothe lack of foreign competition, and to the fact  that price levels were on a sound basis.   Large quantities  of grain are held both in Canada and the United States but the exports fromthe latter country were on a small scale.   Offers from Russiashowed signs of increasing, hut the quslity was stated to beunattractive.  The new crop prospects in Australia showed animprovement;   there was a fair average crop in Argentina but asthe &quot;old crop&quot; wheat was not plentiful there was  littledisposition to enter the export market.     Retail Trade - The money value  of sales in Septemberdecreased by 3.6$ comp&amp;red with September, 1931;  the fall in
                                                          h) hi KJAugust was 6.2$. and lor the seven months ended September  4.3$compared with the corresponding periods respectively of  1951.Retail trade in August in the United States and Germanydeclined by 24 per cent, and 2055 respectively compared with august 1931,   The value of the trade of the Co-operative wholesale Society for the 4 weeks ended 3rd September comperedwith the corresponding period of last year showed a slightdecrease (0.5 per cent.)     Finance - There was no material improvement in the  demands for banking accommodation and whilst deposits in the clearing banks were augmented by  14 million during September the advances made by those Banks fell during the same month  by alike amount to a figure which was lower by about  100 millionthan in March last.  In the same period the Clearing Banksincreased their holdings of bills by over  170 millions  andtheir investments by  100 millions.   Treasury Bills wereallotted on 23rd September at the unprecedented low averageof 7s.lid;  since then there has been a marked recovery,   Thefirst issue made on the London Market after the embargo  on new capital issues was relaxed was one of  12 million of     stockby the Australian Government;  it met with immediate success.The turnover of the London Bankers&apos; Clearing House for september compared unfavourably with that of the correspondingmonth of lest year;  on the other hand, the returns of theProvincial Clearing Houses showed an increase;  it musthowever be recorded that September 1931 was a poor month.   Withregard to the outlook, whilst there were no outstanding  signsof trade recovery there was no indication of any further deterioration.     Canadian Trade - Production in August was at about  thelevel of July but was somewhat lower than in June.   At  the endof August no blast furnaces were in operation, and in that month the output of pig-iron reached the lowest point of the
                                                            9 n fl                                                            f-J irj J:year. viz. 5,992 tons compared with 7,317 tons in July.  .  Theofficial index of wholesale prices of over 500 commodities onthe ha3e of 1926 was 66.8 compared with 66.6 in July.     Australian Trade - Total Imports and Exports (in  Australiancurrency) for the two months July and August amounted  to 12-g-millions and  10 millions respectively - an increase of  3^millions for imports, and a decrease of  1-^ millions for exportscompared with the corresponding period of last year.   Theabsence of rain, particularly in Queensland, caused anxiety.Exports of wheat from 1st December to 30th September amounted to110.6 million bushels compared with 124.9 million bushels in thecorresponding period of last year.   The shipments of  flourincreased from 424,000 tons to 502,000 tons in the same periods of 1931 and 1932 respectively.     Bank clearings in Sydney and Melbourne showed decreases of 165 million aid  13 million respectively in the period from 1st January to 3rd October compared with the previous  year.     Indian Trade - The Indian crop position was regarded as satisfactory.   Based on 1913-14 prices (^ 100) Indian imports                                                          and exports in 1931-32 were represented by index figures of 88and 78 respectively;  the corresponding figures for 1929-30 were128 and 113 recpectively, and for 1930-31, 105 and 94respectively;  the margin of 10 or 11 points between imports and exports has thus persisted for the last 3 years.
