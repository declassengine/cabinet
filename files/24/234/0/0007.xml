Copy No.      *1                              CABINET.                        OTTAWA AGREEMENTS - COPPER.              Memorandum by the President of  the  Board  of Trade.             In four of  the Ottawa Agreements we  have undertaken to        impose a duty upon copper.   The duty  is a heavy one,  and the        agreements provide that  the continuance of the  duty is        dependent upon the Empire  producers being able  to supply the        consumers with copper at prices not exceeding world prices,        and  in quantities sufficient to supply their requirements.   It        was  represented at Ottawa  that the  supplies of  Empire copper        were adequate to take care of the United  Kingdom requirements.        Investigation has shown  that this is  not  the case and that        some time must elapse before anything like the  full demands  .        can  be met.  The position  has been  explored at  conferencesheld        at the Board of Trade between the representatives of the        producers and of the consumers, and as a  result of  prolonged        discussion the attached  agreement has been reached.  It  will        be seen that we are asked  to impose the proposed duty on        electrolytic copper on such a date  as we  may decide in  the        light of a report as to  the availability  of adequate        supplies of Empire copper  to be made  by a joint committee of        producers and consumers  not later  than the end  of next week.        As regards other copper  (fire-refined, etc.) we are asked to        suspend, for the time being, the operation of  the  duty,  it   ,        being understood that the  duty will-be imposed  so  soon as the        Empire producers are in  a  position  to furnish  adequate        quantities of the requisite qualities.             The consumers have  agreed to  assist  the producers in        their efforts to supply what is needed with a  view to ensuring
                                                                   K* %j        the progressive change over from non-Empire  to  Empire  copper.             An important part of  the agreement  is the  establishment        of -a joint committee of producers and consumers under  an        independent chairman;  the  committee is to review the working        of the duty,  and to  report upon the position from time to        time to the producers,  the consumers and the Government.             Some  difficulty has been experienced in reaching        agreement  as to what constitutes &quot;world  prices&quot;.   For  the  time        being,  the London Metal Exchange quotations  are to be  accepted,        but it is  provided that neither the producers,  nor the        consumers,  nor  the Government,  are bound to  adhere to  this if        it does not provide  the safeguards contemplated by the Ottawa        Agreements.             I propose  in the course of my speech to-morrow to refer        to the fact that the producers  and consumers have arrived  at        this agreement,  and  to  say (following what v/as  said by the        Chancellor of the Exchequer in  the course of the debate on        Monday night) that we intend to proceed  in accordance  with        the agreement.   It will be desirable to  point out that while        we take power in the Bill  to remove the  duty, the fact that        the producers and consumers have reached this agreement, and        that they  have  set up a joint committee, is  evidence of        their intention to make the scheme work.  But I should add        that in the interests of the copper using industries,  and  in        accordance with the  express terms of the Ottawa Agreements,        if the circumstances should arise,  which some may perhaps        fear,  we should have no hesitation in applying  promptly the        remedy which the Bill provides.

Memorandum of Agreement.   1.    The representatives of producers  and  of consumerswhose names are attached hereto having examined, in the  lightof the Ottawa Agreements, the position in  regard to sources and supplies of unwrought copper, it is agreed -         (a) that the Government should be asked to impose              the proposed duty on electrolytic  copper on              such date as the Government  may  decide in  the              light of a report to be made by  the Joint              Committee not later than 5th November as to the              availability to consumers on first sale of              adequate supplies of Empire  electrolytic copper              of the requisite kinds;  and         (b) that the Government should be asked to suspend,              for the time being, the operation  of  the duty              upon copper, other than electrolytic  copper,              it being understood w.d announced  publicly that              with a view to carrying out  the  policy of              safeguarding the United Kingdom  market for the              Empire producers it is the intention  that  the              duty should be imposed upon  kinds  of  copper              other than electrolytic copper so  soon as  the              Empire producers are in a position to supply to              consumers on first sale those kinds of copper              in adequate quantities and of the  requisite              qualities.   2.    The intention being to ensure the progressive change-over from non-Empire to Empire copper, the consumers agree  togive every possible assistance to the producers  (including  themaintenance of a technical committee - on  which  representativesof the producers will be welcomed - for the study and discussionof the problems arising) in their endeavours to  satisfy  theconsumers1 requirements in respect of quality, and  further  theywill from now onward as far as lies in their power  purchase from empire producers in preference to non-Eupire suppliers.   3.    The producers and the consumers agree to set up a  JointCommittee with an independent chairman which will review theposition at intervals of not more than three months and  to  place at the disposal of the Committee any information necessary  forthat purpose.   It is agreed that the Joint Committee shall review the working-1-

With regard to world price, the producers and the consumers agree to adopt as world price the London MetalExchange quotations for copper, exclusive of duty, it  being understood (a) that if separate quotations should  in future  bemade for Empire copper and for non-Empire copper,  the  latterquotations shall be adopted for the purpose of this Agreement,and (b) that neither the producers nor the consumers nor theGovernment are bound to adhere to this method of determiningworld price if in future it is found that it does  not  providethe safeguards contemplated by the Ottawa Agreements.   As regards the question of differentials in the case of fire-refined and Bessemer copper, it is agreed to  accept theprinciple that the United Kingdom consumers shall not  be at a disadvantage as compared with foreign consumers.   5.    As  regards &quot;first sale&quot;, it is agreed that this isintended to  mean sale by producers and/or by bona fide agents of producers to any consumer.
