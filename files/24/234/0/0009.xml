(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC             majesty S GOVERNMENT).                                               COPY NO.SECRET.CP. 359(32)                     CABINET.                         INDIA.       Appreciation of the Political Situation bythe Government of India, dated 24th October, 1932.       Circulated for the information of the Cabinet&quot;by the Secretary of State for India.
                                                  13:.;Oonfidential appreciation of the Political  situation in India,  dated 24th October,   1932,  issued on the authority of the      Secretary of State for India.     Following appreciation is for the Dominions, and is the tenth of the series.     1.   During the past month interest \ias &quot;been centered on mr. Gandhi&apos;s fast, its results and reactions.   His dramaticannouncement galvanised the leaders of caste Hindus who inall large centres showed feverish activity in their attempts to conciliate the Depressed Classes by throwing open theTemples, and by promise of the removal of untouchability.Although there may be many sincere workers who fully realise that untouchability, especially as it exists in SouthernIndia, is a blot on Hinduism, it can hardly be expectedthat the social prejudices which have persisted forgenerations will be removed by a whirlwind campaign ofa few weeks, and, as anticipated in the last appreciations,there are signs that the orthodox Hindus such as theSanatan Dharmists are opposed to this radical reform;temples thrown open have been cleansed and purified,idols have been draped and even Malaviya is tending to qualify the removal of untouchability.   The wave ofenthusiasm also did not spread to villages where conservative and orthodox Hinduism is strongest.     While this campaign was being conducted, the leaders were busy over the settlement in Yeravda Jail.   Prima faciethe settlement is very favourable to Doctor Ambedkar and tothe classes he represents;  their representation will bemore than doubled and by means of the system of dual electionsthey will secure representatives of their own choice for                                                secondary/
130secondary elections.   But the]? v/ill experience, atleast in some areas, difficulty over obtaining educatedcandidates, and final election by joint electoratesmay result in those finally elected being under theinfluence of the higher castes.   Mr. Gandhi has once again shown that he does not attach any importance toconsistency, for in November last he said definitely that &quot;while Congress v/ill accept any solution that maybe acceptable to the Hindus, the Mohammedans and theSikhs, it will be no party to special reservations or special electorates for any other minorities&quot;.   Thehistory of the past month, however, shows that Mr.Gandhi is still a power to be reckoned with:  he canappeal to the emotions of the masses and of their leaders, and lead them to adopt a policy ?/hich theirreason condemns.     In some provinces, notably the Punjab, casteHindus no?/ realise that they have had to make a heavysacrifice of their representation, while others are nowcriticising Mr. Gandhi for his failure to get thisquestion settled at the Bound Table Conference, but,as long as the fast continued and opposition to thescheme involved risk to his life, no one ventured to oppose it.   Mr. Gandhi has thus, temporarily at least,recovered the prestige and position which he had lost toa very considerable extent by his lack of success atthe Bound Table Conference and by the failure of thesecond civil disobedience movement.   It is not surprising,therefore, that there have been insistent demands for mr. Gandhi&apos;s release, but even the Hindu National press,                                              recognising/
recognising no doubt that the Government stand firm totheir policy of having no negotiations with Gandhi or with Congress, unless and until they repudiate civildisobedience definitely and unambiguously, are now payingless attention to this cry.   Their criticism, also, ofthe Government&apos;s refusal to allow Mr. Gandhi special facilities for interviews after his fast was over, and thereby to permit him to take part in further communalnegotiations, has not been very severe or prolonged.Gandhi is always an uncertain factor and it is possiblethat many leaders, though regarding him as useful in a fight against the Government, regret his unstabilisinginfluence in other matters.     Meanwhile, flushed with the success of the settlement with the Depressed Classes, Malaviya is busily attempting to negotiate a Hindu-Muslim-Sikh settlement with MaulanaShaukat Ali and other Nationalist Muslims.   whether their negotiations will produce any result is mostuncertain.   There always was a small minority of Muslims,in particular those who in 1920-21 were allied to Congress,who favour joint electorates.   There is possibly some more moderate opinion in favour of such electorates in theprovinces where Muslims are in the minority, but, in the punjab and Bengal Muslim opinion has already expresseditself strongly against disturbing the communal decision,and many leaders will go no further than to say that thefirst offer must come from the other side.   The Hinduscan hardly weaken their position by any further surrender of seats to the Sikhs and Muslims, and some of theofficers of the Hindu Mahasabha have already criticisedany suggestion of conceding the Muslims&apos; 14 points,  as                                                  being/
being anti-national.     It is satisfactory that gandhis fast had little or no effect on the civil disobedience movement.   Suchattempts as were made to revive interest in the movement,or to throw upon the Government the blame for Gandhi&apos;transaction, met with little or no success.   Congress workers,apart from taking a prominent part in the whirlwindcampaign against untouchability, have been active inattempts in several provinces to impress the Congresspoint of view on a Labour delegation consisting of three members of Parliament, or ex-Members of Parliament,Miss E. Wilkinson, Miss Whately and Mr. Matters, whoare touring India.     For the benefit of this delegation, nominally sent out by the India League, London, but actually at theexpense of Congress and with the aid of money sent byMalaviya, demonstrations have been staged to entice thepolice into making lathi charges.   The members havelistened carefully to studied tales of oppression andrepression, and have shown themselves intolerant oflistening to the views of Government Officers, and have refused to visit villages other than those selected bytheir Congress friends, chiefly in districts where civildisobedience has been strongest.   On the whole, however,it is now possible to take an optimistic view and to holdthat civil disobedience is definitely on the down grade..If Congress had had the same power as in 1930, Gandhi&apos;transaction could not have failed to cause a revival;   that it did not do so in 1932 shows that even the leaders arelosing faith in the movement.   To call off the movementwould be an admission of failure, and the movement will                                                probably/
as representing public opinion in India, no serious effort is being made to deal with the evil, or to mobilise publicopinion against the terrorists, and a Muslim paper in Calcutta has pointed out that &quot;the Nationalist papers havecondemned the outrages, some of them with excuses, andgibes for the British Government&quot;.     One further incident may be cited which shows howtrivial incidents may lead to a series of crimes of acommunal nature.   A cow belonging to a Sikh was stolenin a village in Hissar District in the Punjab;  suspicionfell on some Mohammedan butchers;  some days later threeSikhs, it is alleged, entered the village, murdered 14Muslims, including 4 women and some children, and escaped.
