     [This document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government,]                     Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1932.SECRET.CP. 371 (32).                                               Copy No                                   CABINET.ANGLO-PERSIAN   RELATIONS.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   The Memorandum  circulated  by Sir  John  Simon  on the  24th October  a&amp;CP. 358 (32) raises two main questions:  First,  that of the  general conduct  ofour negotiations  with  Persia; second, that  of  the possibility  and  desirability ofvolunteering  or  agreeing  to  arbitration  or  judicial  settlement  of  the questionof Bahrein as a lever for securing our desiderata in other directions.   2. Discussion must  for the moment  proceed on a somewhat hypothetical basis,for  we are still engaged in correspondence with the Persian Government  as  to thewithdrawal of their demand for the evacuation of the British naval station at Henjam,and  if the result of that correspondence is satisfactory a rather different situation will arise  and  different considerations  will  to  some  extent operate.  But, moreparticularly as I am  not, I fear, convinced  by the  arguments in CP. 358 (32), it is,I think, desirable that I should without further delay indicate my own views  (whichare shared by the Government of  India) both on the relatively narrow question ofarbitration on Bahrein and on the wider question of the conduct of  these negotiationsgenerally;  and that I  should indicate  the  course  of  action  which I  personallyconsider should  be followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards our negotiationsgenerally, and particularly in the event of a deadlock being reached with Persia overthe question of Henjam.                                   I. Bahrein.    3. I will deal first with the question of Bahrein, for this is the central feature ofthe Memorandum circulated by the Foreign Secretary.    4. I may, perhaps, remind my colleagues that Bahrein is an island landlocked bythe Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, and geographically remote from Persia, whichin the last  2,000 years has apparently at  various  times been  under the dominion ofthe Persians, of Arab tribes from the neighbouring coast, of the Turks, of the Sultansof Muscat,  and of the Portuguese.   The Portuguese were expelled hj the Persians in1602, and from  that  date the Islands remained for considerable periods under thecontrol of Persia until she was herself driven out in  1783 by Arab tribes  from  the-mainland.  Since that period  it is fair to say that Persian jurisdiction has never been exercised in Bahrein, and His Majesty&apos;s Government  have since  1820 been in treatyrelations with its Arab rulers, whom in a series of engagements they have recognised for this purpose as independent.  Throughout  the nineteenth century repeated  claims were made by Persia to sovereignty over the island  and still  more numerous  claims by  the Turks, the suzerains of the mainland till the war.   Claims were also made on one occasion  by the  Egyptians, and might with stronger justification have been made-by the Rulers of Muscat.  We succeeded  in persuading the -Turks- to relinquish their claim in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, which  was awaiting ratification on.the outbreak of the war.  The Persian claim, still remains.    5. There  seems  little doubt that our case is a very strong one, resting, as  it does,.on  effective possession  of  the island-based&apos; on conquest-by  the present  line ofSheikhs for a period of 150 years, and I appreciate  the force of the argument that,.in  these circumstances, we ought not to fear  taking or allowing the question of theposition of our client to go for decision before an international tribunal.  But the case is not so simple as  it  looks,  f fully recognise the importance- of the principle ofarbitration in our general  policy,  and-1 recognise: too that it- is- conceivable  that itncertain circumstances it might be  difficult for us to refuse to agree to the question ofBahrein being disposed of by judicial settlement.  But. I  see the strongest, objection;as  matters, stand to. making  any move in  this; direction ourselves;and. I feel  equally1373    60 11.32
strongly,  and in this  also my views are shared by the Government  of India, thatin the event  of Persia making any effort  to  take  us  to  arbitration (and  she  couldendeavour to do so only by very devious routes) we should resist so long as reasouaTilypossible by every means in our power.    6. The main grounds for my objections and those of the Government of India areas follows: First, the undesirability of arousing international interest in the Gulf or of bringing foreign Powers into closer contact with it than can be avoided ; secondly,the real risks, as  I see the case, which  are  involved, particularly given the vitalimportance to us of Bahrein, in  leaving the  decision  of this  question to an  inter-national judicial or arbitral tribunal; and finally, the  quite  unsubstantial nature ofthe Persian claim.    7. As  regards the first of these points, the Committee of Imperial Defence,  whenthey  investigated the question  of  our general Persian  policy in 1928, reached  theconclusion, which was accepted by the  Cabinet, that the maintenance  of our special position in the Gulf was more  important, if possible, now than even before the war.I need  not labour this point.   It  is obvious  that it makes the retention of Bahrein,which is  the  key position in the Gulf on  which our policy and our communicationsessentially pivot, a matter  of  the first importance for us. . But I ought to stress thatit was with these considerations in view that, when Mis Majesty&apos;s Government acceded to the Optional J31anse. they did so with reservations, the eftecTof which is to preclude the Persians frourtaising the  question of &quot;Bahrein under that  clause.  The difficultiesof keeping foreign Powers out of the Gulf,  substantial  before  the war, are no lessgreat to-day.   But that is  no reason why we should do  anything  calculated  toencourage  their interest or make it easier for them to gain a foothold in that, area.    8. As  regards  my second point, I appreciate that it would be difficult for  us tosay publicly that we feel no  confidence, or only a qualified confidence, in the verdictof an international  Court.  I do not suggest that we should do this in so many words.But we must face the facts.  In the first place, my colleagues will, 1 think, agree thatit is far from improbable that the position of  a small country like Persia is likely to arouse a certain amount of sympathy in  international circles, more particularly  whenthe other  party to the case is His Majesty&apos;s Government.  That  sympathy seems tome not unlikely to  be reflected in any award or judgment which might be given, andthat is particularly the  case  since  the Court  is by no  means unlikely to  contain a percentage of  jurists of small nations.   Apart from that, our case  being essentiallybased on possession (never  recognised  by Persia) since 1783, it is  quite conceivable that certain jurists might take the Persian view that in the absence  of any formalabandonment  of  her  claim by   Persia (and in  the   face, indeed,  of its  formalmaintenance over a long period of years) that claim was  a  good one in internationallaw and should be upheld.   I have myself  no confidence that we  should  get a unanimous decision in our favour by  an  international Court;  we might  well find ourselves faced with a hostile judgment of a  most  embarrassing character, Avith  thefurther  possible complication of  a certain liability  for  enforcing it upon our client.Even a majority judgment in our favour on the strict  points of  law involved would strengthen the  hands of Persia.  (The Minister of Court has already hinted that anyadverse decision would be unacceptable to Persia, and  would be  another example ofprejudice  against  small  Oriental  nations ;  and the  use to which the Persians would put a judgment against them which was not unanimous needs no development.)   9. Finally, I suggest  that there, must  be some limit to the extent to which we can reasonably be required to volunteer or to acquiesce in reference to judicial settlementof a  claim which we  regard with  reason  as  wholly unsubstantial.  Even were  thePersian claim  a  good one, I think  that His Majesty&apos;s Government  would have to fightit, and do  what they reasonably could to  delay any decision on it, because of the disastrous  effects on our position in the Gulf and  in  the Middle East which wouldresult from its acceptance.   But it is not a  good one, and that is to my mind all  the stronger reason for not running  the very substantial risks  which in  my judgment are involved in allowing this matter to be examined by an international tribunal.   10. I may sum up  the position about, Bahrein very briefly.  The  Persian claim, sofar as can be judged, is not a good one, but even if it were it is not one  which  we can afford to acquiesce in.  The element of uncertainty  as  to  the future of the present regime in Persia makes  it  particularly desirable to  avoid  my positive commitment.The retention  of Bahrein is vital to our air communications with India ;  to our position
onin the Gulf, and so to our position in the Middle East.  The importance of our Gulfposition is greater, on the findings of the Committee of Imperial Defence so recently as1928, than it was even in the years before the war, and its importance has been stillfurther increased since the date of those findings by the fact that the Gulf  has in  the meanwhile become the main airway to the East.   The loss of Bahrein, or a compromise which would affect our position in Bahrein, would cut our air communications, would leave us without a possible naval station  (in the event of  our having to evacuateHenjam), and would  have  the most calamitous effect on our relations with all  theother Arab rulers of  the Arab littoral  of the Gulf.   The confidence of  those rulershas already to  some  extent been shaken by our inability to implement our  engage-ments to the Sheikh of Mohammerah.   It is uot, indeed,  going too far to say that theretention of  our  position in the Gulf  generally stands  or falls by the retention ofthe status quo  in Bahrein.  The risks involved in  international examination of  thequestion are substantial, and having  regard to all  these circumstances  1, like  theGovernment  of India, see  the strongest objection, which I trust my colleagues willshare, to either volunteeringor acq uiescing in  any suggestion of judicial settlementor judicial investigation&apos;bfit.    &quot;        &quot;&apos;               :-  .             *                     II. The general  Negotiations with Persia.   11. I desire now to invite  the attention of  my colleagues to the  conduct of  thegeneral negotiations with Persia which  is examined in Sir John Simon&apos;s Memorandum.I had myself intended to bring this matter before them,  for I have for long been  farfrom satisfied with the course  they have been taking.   12. I recognise that our special position in the Gulf is one which has largely been forced on us by Persian impotence over the last  two centuries.   I recognise, too, thatAve have not used our opportunities in  the past  (such  as that given by  our defeat of persia in 1857) formally to  consolidate our position in it.  But while on many pointsour formal position  is a weak  one, we are  in possession ;  and there  is  no reason,particularly when dealing with Orientals, why we should underestimate the bargainingvalue of our assets, unsubstantial as in some cases it may be, or  abandon them on thefirst challenge.  And the present regime depends essentially on  two lives the Shah,able and dominating, but with an heir  who is still a boy and who will stand no chanceof succeeding if his father disappears  in the  near future, and  the Minister of Court,Taimotirtache, a diplomat  of the first ability,  who has since  192S dominated  our negotiations, but dependent for his strength on  the continued existence  of the  Shah.In such conditions, we must consider  our own  interests first, and, while we must  beprepared to yield on  certain points to  Persia, we ought, in my view, in the first place to yield nothing essential which, we can contest,  and secondly not to  overestimate  thestrength of Persia&apos;s case, or underestimate either the value of a format  abandonment of points our  title to which  may be weak, or  the extent to which,  by taking a firmline with her and making her appreciate that  friendly relations with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not without their value, we can persuade her  to adopt  a reasonable attitude.    13.  When we started these negotiations in 1928 our  list of assets was  substantial.&apos;They were not all good,  and, recognising that, we were prepared to abandon all non-essentials  (whatever  our  title)  in the interests of  securing  a satisfactory  general settlement, and, in particular, the continuance of our air route on the Persian littoral,the retention of our naval station at Henjam, and the formal withdrawal by Persia ofher unsubstantial claim to  Bahrein and of her  claim  (equally&apos;important on a  lesserscale and, so far as can be judged, equally unsubstantial) to the  Arab islands of Tamband Abu Musa.  The negotiations have now been  proceeding  for four years.  the persians have conducted  them  throughout with remarkable skill  and even at  themoment can claim  to  hold  the diplomatic initiative.   In, the course  of the  dis-cussions which have proceeded we have  been stripped one  by one of  practically. all our points, and  the Persians, having captured  our outworks, are now pressingus on  the  questions of  Henjam and Bahrein.  Since 1928   we have  acquiesced in the abolition of capitulations ; in the grant  ofjtariff autonomy to  Persia ; in  theabandonment  ot our control of quarantine;  and  we  have intimated  that  we  areprepared to meet &quot;bTer-over-the&quot; controFiiOigMiu  and buoying^ in the Gulf and over-the  terms  of the Slavery Convention-of-1882.  We  are prepared-in addition (and-have made  this clear to her)  as part of a satisfactory settlement, to make substantial and financially costly concessions over the  Duzdap  Railway (which may be of some
4-2i      importance to us,  but certainly equally  is of consideraI)le importance to Persia);      to [recognise her title to the Arab island of Sirri ;  to  surrender an enclave which      we have  held at Basidu since 1820;  to  abandon a million pounds of  war debt;      to move the headquarters of  the Resident  in the Persian Gulf from Bushire (a move      which would probably cost us the best part of a hundred thousand pounds, and which      the late Minister, Sir R. Clive, pressed for on the ground that it would clinch  the      Treaty settlement).  In addition, we havo withdrawn the Indo-European Telegraph      Department from  Persia  and  made  her a  present of  the  telegraph  lines,   etc.      (it is true this arrangement] suited us  well, but it was a  concession to Persia  and      appears to have gratified her, and our Minister  at the time thought that it might be      a  concession  of importance in  the negotiations) ;  and  finally, after considerable      negotiation, very skilfully conducted by the Persians, in the course of which we were      incidentally led  to believe  that this particular concession  would ease matters as      regards the retention of our station at  Henjam, we  have withdrawn our air route, at      considerable expense and inconvenience to ourselves, from the Persian to the Arab      side of the Gulf.  Our  stock of bargaining counters has  thus gradually been very      seriously depleted and in return we have  secured  from Persia nothing whatsoever.      On the contrary, having cleared the ground at our expense  and at no  cost to herself.      she is now concentrating on the two points of principal  interest to us Henjam and      Bahrein.         14. My views as regards Bahrein have been set out above.  As regards Henjam, I very     &quot; reluctantly agree that if the Persian claim is  pressed we  must abaudou our station,     there and remove to Bahrein. But if Persia refuses to meet us over  Henjam,  then  I      am quite  definitely ofjmjmon that the right course is to break off the negotiations.      There is nothing of real importance which we should stand to gain by their continuance.      Like the Foreign Secretary, I should be glad to see a friendly settlement with  Persia,      and the efforts of the Government  of India and the India Office have been directed      for the last four years to co-operating in such a settlement.  But I cannot agree that      all the  concessions  should  be on our side,  and  I cannot see any advantage in a      settlement under which we should sacrifice every possible asset we have and run very      serious risks  in  connection with Bahrein  in return  merely for Persian goodwill.   I0    \ recognise that Persia can make herself  tiresome  to us in  minor ways if negotiations f    ] break down.  But she cannot do so in anything of really decisive importance, and it     / seems to me impossible to contend that British &quot;goodwill to PersiaTisTof less^value than%   .  Persian goodwill to Great Britain, though  that is the position into which the Persiaus,0 0*  are gradually  manoeuvring us.  On a further  point  in the same  connection I uuder-      stand that it  is now stated  that the Shah has personally committed himself  to  the      prosecution of the Bahrein claim and  that it is desirable to help him  to save his face      over  this.  The  Persians, quite  rightly from  their  point  of view, have used every      method of bringing pressure on us  as  regards Bahrein, and the suggestion that we      must compromise because the Shah attaches  importance  to having his  way over      Bahrein is only the latest move in their  campaign.   Were  it a question of meeting      the Shah over something relatively unimportant, I should see no objection.  But I see      the strongest objection to compromising our own solid position because His Majesty,      realising the strength of  that position, chooses to transfer the dispute to  a personal      basis.  If we  are  to abandon  solid assets eveiy time that we are faced with a skilful.      diplomatic  campaign by  our  opponents, our  position  will  become  exceedingly      difficult,                                       III. Conclusions.          15. In these circumstances the course of action which I should like to suggest for      the consideration of my colleagues is the following:              (a) As  regards Bahrein,  that my colleagues should  endorse  the  general           conclusions  set out in paragraph 10  above.  If this view is  accepted, there will.           be no  particular advantage in troubling  the Law Officers to record an opinion.           In any event, we must, I think, take our stand on the limited point of undisturbed           occupation since 1783  and resist any claim based on  the fact that, while Persia           has exercised  no effective control iu Bahrein since the islands were conquered           by the  ancestors ol the present Sheikh  in  1783,  she has exercised control of           the island at  various earlier  periods since (and before) the beginning of  the-           Christian era.             (6) If  the Persians withdraw their  demand for the evacuation of lien jam, that.           we&apos; should make it clear to t lie in that while we are anxious and ready to conclude-
1 0 Q-i. t/    a  general  treaty settlement  with  them, and while  we  have  already  made    concessions of substantial importance  as  the  first stages of such a settlement,    no further  concession can be expected from us, but that we are prepared to make    a  treaty settlement on the terms  already indicated to  them. viz. the reopening    of the Duzdap Railway ; the abandonment of  our claim to Sirri ;  the evacuation    of Basidu; the removal  of the Residency ;  the payment of  rent for Henjam,    and, if necessary&apos;, the joint use of Henjam by the  Persian  Navy ;  the modifi-    cation of  the  Slavery Convention;  the transfer  of certain  wireless  stations ;    the abandonment of  1,000,000  of the war  debt (the  outstanding balance      510,000 of which we are also prepared to abandon)  ; and  finally, the definite    assurance to Persia  of British  goodwill and British support in  so far as this is    practicable.  If the Persians are not prepared to accept these  terms, I would    favour  the adjournment, if  possible, sine die  of  the  discussions  in  whatever    manner  is regarded as most suitable.   All we want in the Gulf is  the general    maintenance of the status quo (in particular, at Henjam) ; and if  we can secure    this, a formal treaty  is of only moderate importance to us.       (c)  // Persia insists on the  evacuation  of Henjam, that we should  acquiesce    in her  demand (since we have never  questioned  her  sovereignty), but that  we    should claim a minimum period of two years  during which to provide alternative    accommodation, and that we should equally  make  it  clear  that while we had    acquiesced in her demand,  the  changed  attitude  which it  represents and  its    inconsistency with the line hitherto followed is such that the treat)7 negotiations    must be regarded as at an end.   16. I think  it  most important that in either of  the alternatives discussed in (6) and(c) we  shoidd retain the initiative in  bringing negotiations to an end, and should not leave it to Persia  to dismiss us on the  ground that  what we offer  as the price of herfriendship is insufficient.  FinaRy, I think the course of the negotiations Bhows thata policy of conciliation and  compromise  has cost us  much and  gained  us nothing.Events so far leave me with no confidence in Persian bona fides (nor do I blame themfor trying to  secure all they can at our expense).   I would now adopt a stronger fine.It cannot be more costly, and I am  not without hope that it may bring  the&quot;Pefsiansto see reason.   India Office,31st October 1932.S. H,
