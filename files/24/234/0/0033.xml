THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY &apos;0F HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                 Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1932.MOST  SECRET.                                        Copy No.      9CP.  384 (32).                                CABINET.AIR  DISARMAMENT.                Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.     I CIRCULATE herewith a minute by the  Chief of the Air  Staff dealing&quot; with the  Annex to the &quot;Form of  Declaration&apos;- on  Disarmament contained in C.P. 377  (32).  I desire strongly to endorse this minute.  Whilst I am ready, in view of the paramount importance of the political issues at stake, to accept, and, indeed, to amplify, the second paragraph of the section of  the Annex, dealing with Air  Armaments, I regret I am wholly unable to accept the first paragraph. This, in my judgment, contains a series of propositions that are at variance with the  facts.  I  must emphasise that hitherto  these sweeping propositions  have either not been investigated at all or have been examined in the  most cursory fashion.     I will explain  as briefly  as  may be my  main  grounds  of objection  to the  draft:      1. &quot; The only completely  satisfactory  method of  dealing with the  future menace of bombing from the air &quot; is, in my view,  the entire abolition of all flying service and civil.  The mere disappearance of military and naval aircraft would only aggravate, not diminish, this  menace, for  it would at once convert civil aviation into a most potent instrument of war, to which London and these islands would be peculiarly vulnerable,  and against  which  they  would then,  as Sir  John  Salmond points out, be wholly defenceless.   Moreover, the  Navy and Army could afford no protection.  In  this connection it must be borne in mind that  the commercial air fleet of the United  Kingdom must  always be greatly outnumbered (as it is to-day)  by the fleets of  the principal Continental Powers. In the future it is my confident belief that in the Empire as a whole we shall see the development of commercial ah&quot;1  transport  on  a scale which no other country can rival;  but, in the event of war, it  will not be possible to recall our aircraft overseas to these islands owing to intervening enemy territory.     With the consequences of the  disappearance of  military aircraft from the Middle East and India I shall deal later.     2.  The &quot;international regulation of civil aviation &quot; would  afford no safe- guard at all.  I do not know  precisely what is intended by the phrase, but even a far-reaching scheme for the international  ownership and operation of com- mercial air lines (which the Cabinet rejected as impracticable last April after discussion by a Cabinet Sub-Committee) would be valueless.  An aggressor state which had first broken the Kellogg Pact would obviously not hesitate to requisition aircraft wholesale, whether nationally or internationally owned, just  as  in the late  war we ourselves  requisitioned warships which  were building  for Turkey and  Chile in British yards.  More  important still, any such scheme would leaveuntouched by far the largest number of civil aircraft existing tcVday, i.e., those used  for internal flying, whether for business or pleasure, all of-which,  in theabsence of military aircraft, would be potentially effective bombers.     3.  An &quot; international prohibition  of bombing &quot; which is now recommendedwithout qualification  and without  the  all-important  reservations of the  BenesResolution and our own White Paper would have no prospect of being observedunder the stress of war, as has been openly admitted by the French and others in       [7823]
our conversations.  I would remind my colleagues of the manner  in which we ourselves were constrained to abandon the Declaration of London in the late war,though we had at first publicly stated our solemn intention of regulating our naval action in accord with its provisions; and of the fact that, as an act of reprisalagainst (say) the use by us of measures of naval pressure, the legality of whichwas questioned, the bombing of  London  would be permissible in InternationalLaw, whatever agreement  there  might be to the contrary.   Moreover, such a prohibition would of itself entail the abandonment of the use of aircraft in theMiddle East and elsewhere, even if the major proposition of abolishing naval andmilitary aircraft were rejected.     4.  I do not believe for a moment that the abolition of naval  and military aircraft  &quot;would carry Avith it substantial reductions  in  the cost  and scale ofmilitary and naval armaments.&quot;  My colleagues know as well as I do that the useof aircraft in the Middle East and elsewhere has saved many millions of poundsover the past ten years.  The Government of India have recently in terms stressed the  great economies  effected by  air power in operations on  the  North-west frontier.  Sir Francis  Humphrys has stated of Iraq that &quot;I am personally ofthe opinion that the whole fabric of administration of  this country would be inimminent danger  of collapse if the Royal Air  Force were confined to Shaibah(Basrah) in 1932.&quot; What, then, would be the effect of the total disappearance ofmilitary  aircraft from  Iraq ? Let it not be forgotten that at the height of the rebellion of 1920 military expenditure in that country reached no less a figurethan  384. millions; and that the difference in the estimates for the cost of control by ground  and air forces respectively, which were placed before the Cabinet atthe time the decision to institute air control was taken eleven years ago, was from 4 to  6 millions per annum.   In  the Aden  Protectorate, if  aircraft were withdrawn  (or bombing abolished), the  Imam  of the  Yemen could once moreoverrun at his pleasure  the territory of the tribes whom we are pledged to protect.Before air power was called in to expel him, the Chiefs of Staff had estimated thecost of a ground  expedition to deal with him at from  6 to  10 millions, to say nothing of the cost of the subsequent occupation.  Such expeditions would becomerecurring features or we should  have to stand aside and ignore our pledges. TheChief of the Imperial General Staff in his  latest paper (CP. No. 373 (32)) has stated that the Army  will not be able to dispense with anti-aircraft guns;  andfurther that &quot; a reversion to  1914 armaments (including the abolition of aircraft)would mean a very considerable expansion of the present size of  the Army.&quot;  Hehas further pointed out in  commenting on  the extraordinary low percentage oftroops, including air forces, we maintain per thousand of population in overseas territories  as compared with other nations that &quot;it is quite  certain that theabolition  of mechanized forces  and  aircraft would necessitate  a  very large increase in the above percentage so far as we are concerned.&quot;  It was at one stagesuggested that, with the disappearance of aircraft, a reduction might be possiblein the size of capital ships; the Naval  Staff subsequently advised that this wouldnot, in fact, be the case. I  am sure that the fate of other optimistic estimateswould be the same.  Aircraft carriers might, indeed, disappear; but I entertainno doubt that the Navy, since even to-day it is urged that our cruiser strength is entirely  inadequate to patrol the vast ocean spaces, would,  if deprived of the &apos;&apos; eyes of the Fleet&apos;&apos; (aircraft), be constrained  before long to demand additionalcruisers and other scouting  craft. This has, indeed, been put beyond question bythe authoritative testimony of  the present First Sea Lord.   Last  year the Chancellor of the Exchequer put forward a proposal for the abolition of all fleetaircraft.  The First Sea Lord, in the course of a  memorandum on this project,stated that &quot;Far from resulting in economy, the abolition of sea-borne aircraft is bound to lead  to additional heavy expenditure in other directions.&quot;     For these reasons, I must reluctantly repeat my inability to accept the first paragraph of the relevant section of the Annex.  The second paragraph I am, as I have said, ready to accept as  it stands, subject to any necessary modification of the last sentence dealing with Germany.   Moreover, I am ready to amplify it, on the lines suggested by Sir John Salmond, since I do  not question the necessity of some specific proposal dealing  with air bombardment.   I submit that the draft, thus amplified, affords abundant material for  a &quot;gesture&quot; at Geneva.    Out&apos; proposals  for Air Disarmament thus  rounded off  would, in fact, be much more concrete and far-reaching than those under the heads of Naval  and Land Arma- ments alike in  the qualitative  and  quantitative spheres.   Coupled  with the
                     Minute by the Chief of the Air Staff.Secretary of State,     1.  I have read with profound disappointment the section of the Annex to cp. 377 (32) dealing with Air Armaments.  I had received the definite impressionfrom the Foreign Secretary at the meeting of the  Cabinet Sub-Committee  atwhich I was present, that he considered it practicable (a)  to delete the reference-to the &quot; entire abolition of naval and military aircraft &quot; and the internationalisa-tion of civil aviation; (&amp;) to explain that the only real guarantee against the futuremenace of bombing from the air was the abolition of all flying, service and civil,which was  admittedly impracticable;  and (c)  to concentrate in consequence onthe  other  constructive measures  of  air  disarmament,  both  quantitative andqualitative, which were contained in (1) to (3) of (3) of the Annex to CP. 360 (32).     2.  I view with the gravest misgiving the first paragraph of the new draft.This seems to me to go much further than anything hitherto contemplated, and I desire to represent as strongly as possible that the sweeping recommendations it contains appear  to me wholly incompatible  with the requirements of national and Imperial Defence.     3.  I do not want to recapitulate at length the arguments with which youare already familiar,  but, very briefly,  I may say that the principal objections toputting forward  a proposal for the total abolition of military and naval aircraftcontingent on the internationalisation  of civil aviation are as follows :      (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government have themselves never formally  adopted it           as their policy or carried out any serious enquiry into its implications           and its effect upon Imperial Defence;     (b) Any public  adherence of His   Majesty&apos;s  Government  to  a  &quot;total           abolition &quot; policy,  however  conditional  it might  be, and however           unlikely of immediate acceptance, would do serious and lasting injury           to the morale of  the Royal Air Force, and would cause grave political           embarrassment as regards its use for police purposes overseas;    (c)  The total abolition  of military and naval aircraft would  not  remove the           menace of bombing  attack on the civil population, but  would increase           the risk from civil aircraft, against which all effective defences would           have been abolished;  this  is a risk which will grow as commercial           aviation develops in the future;    (d) Internationalisation of civil aviation in the sense proposed as a necessary           prior  condition  to the abolition of all military air forces would  be           unworkable.  A  Cabinet Sub-Committee  reported  in  this sense this           spring, and the  Cabinet accepted its report.    3.  I submit, therefore, that we should put a drastic quantitative reductionin the forefront of our policy for  air  disarmament.  A general reduction in thescale of the  leading air forces would mean       (i) Substantial savings in expenditure;     (ii) A  lessening of the menace of air attack on this cottntry; and    (iii) The curbing of competitive development in the size of the Metropolitan          air forces of European  countries  in  general, compatibly with the          maintenance of  moderate-sized air  forces for  &quot;police&quot; purposes  in          overseas areas.extreme moderation of our air policy for years past tliev would, I suggest, placeus in an unchallengeable position.  I urge then, with all the force at my command,that we should not be rushed unnecessarily into a policy  which, for the reasons Ihave given, I  believe  to be at once impracticable and fraught with the gravestdangers to the British Empire a policy, moreover, which, once publicly formu-lated, would be a continuing source of embarrassment for the future.

Air Ministry, November 5, 1932.o    4.  I venture, therefore,  to suggest that a  policy  of quantitative  andqualitative  reduction  should  be put  forward  in  some  such  terms  as thefollowing :          &quot; An object to  which His  Majestys  Government attach the greatest    importance as a factor in the preservation of peace is the curtailment of air    armaments to the minimum requirements for police duties and for national    defence.    They therefore press for     (1) the  immediate reduction  of  the air forces of the leading Powers to the          level of those of the United Kingdom:    (2) a cut of 33^ per cent,  all round on the air forces thus reduced, British          included;    (3) a limitation of the unladen weight of service aircraft to the lowest figure          upon which general agreement can be obtained.    These measures will, if agreed to, of themselves greatly diminish the dangers to the civil  population from the misuse of air bombardment.  As additional measures of protection, they further propose     (4) the  immediate  appointment of  a strong  international Commission  to          examine the problem of air bombardment with a positive mandate  to          frame a code for the protection of non-combatants  by the absolute          prohibition  of  attacks  on  centres  of  population and  such  other          restrictions as may be agreed;    (5) the  institution of a system of publicity for all civil aircraft,  by means  of          an international  register  to be maintained at Geneva and inspections          at will by officers of the League of Nations as a guarantee against the          embodiment of military features in civil aircraft;    (6) the  encouragement of economic  agreements  between  civil aviation under-          takings in the various countries participating in the Convention.                                (Signed)      JOHN  SALMOND.                                                    Chief of the  Air Staff.
