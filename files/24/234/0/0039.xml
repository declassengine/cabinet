ENC LOS U E ECOMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DSPENCE.Extract from  the Minutes  of  the  253rd Meeting,  neld on  June  29,  1931.3t        a        x        a        x        a (7)-SOUTH PERSIAN  OILFIELDS  DEFENCE SCHEME:            REINFO RCEIvlENTS FROM IN LI A.                 (C.I.D.  Paper No.  350-C.)(Previous  Reference:   C.I.D.  Minutes of  the 252nd Meeting, Minute 9.)     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum by the Over-sea Defence Committee (C.I.D.  Paper No.  350-C) pointing out that thepresent draft Defence Scheme for the South Persian Oil Fields provi-ded for a reinforcement of only one battalion from India, expressing the opinion that this reinforcement might prove unwisely small, and recommending that the Government of India should be requested to ear-mark a Brigade for despatch to Persia in an emergency, providedcircumstances in India permitted.     SIR SAMUEL WILSON recalled that at the last meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence a memorandum by the Oversea DefenceCommittee had been considered, dealing with the general inadequaciesof the present defence scheme for the South Persian Oilfields.   Inthat paper the Oversea Defence Committee mentioned that they proposedto refer in another memorandum to the question of reinforcementsvhich would be required from India.   The Government of India had drawn attention to the very small reinforcement of one battalion prc-posed in the present scheme and had suggested that it v/as unwise to despatch a single battalion to an area where it could not be readilyand quickly reinforced.   Although the present scheme did not purportto deal with an attack in force by organised troops equipped onEodern lines, the Oversea Defence Committee agreed that the reinforce-aent.  of only one battalion might prove unwisely small, as the&quot;cattalion v/ould be split into a number of detachments without thepossibility of reinforcement.    They, therefore, now recommended tothe Committee of Imperial Defence that the Government of India shouldbe requested to earmark a brigade for despatch to Persia providedcircumstances in India permitted,  with a view to one battalion being sent immediately from Karachi to the oilfields, a second following as quickly as possible to Basra,  and the remainder of the brigade beingdisposed in accordance with the situation.     MRC WEDGWOOD BENN said he br d no comment to make on therecommendation of the Oversea Defence Committee, which had originatedKith the Government of India itself.     SIR GEORGE MILNE observed that the defence of the South PersianOilfields was a commitment of the Air Ministry, though personally he agreed with the recommendation for a reinforcement of one brigadefrom India.
     SIR JOHN SALMOND also concurred in the recommendation.     MR. ALEXANDER, whilst concurring in the proposal to request India to earmark a brigade, drew attention to the factthat the defence scheme envisaged the employment of navallanding parties.   He hoped the Committee would realise thatno reliance could he placed on strong naval forces being available to assist in the protection of the oilfields, as theships in these waters were few in number and small in size,and the provision of naval landing parties would depend ontheir disposition and responsibilities at the time the emergencyoccurred.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if an emergency occurred,whatever forces could be made available would have to beemployed.                        CONCLUSION.     THE COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed, in accordancewith the recommendation of the Oversea Defence Committee -         To recommend that the Government of India should     be requested to earmark a brigade for despatch to     Persia, provided circumstances in India permit, with     a view to one battalion being sent immediately from     Karachi to the oilfields, a second following as     quickly as possible to Basra, and the remainder of     the brigade being disposed in accordance with the     situation.x        x        x        x        x        x2, Whitehall Gardens, S.T.1.
