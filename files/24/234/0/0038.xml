Copy No.    3                                                                       tlxCP.  389  (32).CABINET.                                                                t    I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the following note onthe subject of our war debt to the United States, which Sir Ronald Lindsay hasbeen instructed to present to the United States Secretary of State to-day, the10th November.                                                                    J. S.    November 10, 1932. Sir,     It will be remembered that on the 22nd June, 1931, His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment in the United Kingdom subscribed wholeheartedly to the principle of the proposal made by the President of the United States on the preceding day for the postponement during one year of all payments on inter-governmental debts.  The object of this proposal, as stated at the time, was to relieve the pressure of the difficulties resulting from the fall in  prices and lack of confidence in  economic and political stability, and to assist in the re-establishment of confidence.     2.  The  hopes which were early raised  by the Presidents initiative  have unfortunately not been realised, and the economic troubles which it was designed to alleviate  have not come to an end.   Indeed,  in October  of last year, the communique published at Washington on the occasion of M. Laval&quot;s visit already recognised that &quot; prior to the expiration of the Hoover Year some agreement on inter-governmental obligations may be necessary covering the period of business depression.  The initiative in this matter should be taken early by  the European Powers principally concerned&apos; within  the framework of the agreements existing prior to the 15th JutJ 1931.&quot;   To-day  many thoughtful men throughout the world are convinced that if the depression is to be overcome  further  remedial measures must be sought.     3.  It was in accordance with the recommendation quoted above that in June last the European Creditor Powers met at Lausanne to agree on a lasting settle- ment of  the problem  created by  inter-governmental  payments in  respect of reparations.  The series of agreements  reached on  the 9th  Jukg aims at the ultimate termination of all  reparation payments.  It represents the maximum contribution in the field of  inter-governmental finance  which the Governments concerned have so far  been able to make towards that early restoration  of world prosperity in which the people of the United States, no less than those of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations, have so deep an interest, and for the achieve-ment of which the co-operation of the United States is essential.    4.  On the nature of the remedial measures that may have to be adopted it is  not proposed  now to say more than that,  in the recent past, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United&apos;Kingdom have frequently expressed their view; andthat neither in the realm of theory nor in that  of fact  are they able  to find any reason for amending  it.  They believe that  the  regime of inter-governmentalfinancial obligations,  as now existing, must be  reviewed.  They are  profoundly impressed with the importance of  acting quickly,  and  they earnestly hope  that    6598  [7842]
the United States Government will see its way to enter into an exchange of viewsat the earliest possible moment.    5.  The immediate objective of the present note, however, is of a more limitednature.  On the 15th December the next instalment of the British War Debt isdue to be paid.  It is not possible to hope that agreement can be achieved in five weeks  on matters of such vast  scope.   Confronted last summer with a similardifficulty the Conference of Lausanne  found it necessary, in order to allow its work  to proceed undisturbed, to reserve, during the period of the Conference,the execution of the payments due to the participating Powers.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the  United Kingdom hope that a similar procedure may now befollowed, and ask for a suspension  of the payments due from them for the periodof the discussions now suggested, or for  any other period that may be agreed upon.    6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  believe that theproposed discussions could best begin in Washington, and if this suggestion meetswith concurrence, they are prepared to provide me with the necessary instructions.On this point, however, as well as on other points touched upon in the present note,they await an expression  of the views of the United States Government.                                                   I have the honour to be,                                                       &amp;c. &amp;c, &amp;c.
