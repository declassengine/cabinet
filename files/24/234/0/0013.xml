THIS DOCUMENT 1^ THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1932.CP. 363 (32).SECRET.Copy  No.CABINET.j E 5478/606/31]   SUGGESTED  EXTENSION OF  IMPERIAL  PREFERENCE TO                              PALESTINE.     AT their meeting on the 11th October the Cabinet considered a memorandum of the 7th October on this subject by the Secretary of  State for the Colonies (Annex A),* and decided on  the 11th  October to reconstitute the  Cabinet Committee which had previously examined  the matter, in order that the present position might be fully and carefully considered.     2.  The United States, Italian and Spanish Governments have categorically informed His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, in communications which form Annexures III, IV and V respectively to Sir  P.  Cunliffe-Lister&apos;s attached memorandum  (Annex A),* that  they regard  Palestine as  a foreign country from the point of view of Imperial Preference, and that they would claim for their goods imported into the  United Kingdom any preferential rates which might be accorded to goods from Palestine.   This  attitude is in accordance with the view of the situation which the Law Officers have taken in the past.  It is true that the French Government have returned what appears to be a favourable reply. But,  apart from the  fact that France is understood  to enjoy no most-favoured- nation rights in this country, the  importance of her acquiescence in the proposal is considerably diminished by the fact  that she is also a mandatory Power with mandated territories, to some  of which at  any  rate  she herself may  accord preference, or desire to do so. No great importance can be attached to the reply of the Brazilian  Government, which is chiefly concerned with the question  of Brazilian oranges, particularly  as it has been realised from  the first that it was the Italians or the Americans who were most likely to raise serious objections to our proposal.  The position therefore remains that the majority of the  Govern- ments who were consulted have  stated that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government accord Imperial Preference  to Palestine, they  will consider themselves entitled to claim- similar treatment for their goods under the  most-favoured-nation clauses of their&apos; Commercial Treaties with the United Kingdom.     3.  The Foreign Office consider that the  case of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter must (in  view of the series of  adverse opinions by successive law officers) be  regarded  as  a  weak  one and that His  Majesty&apos;s Government in  the United Kingdom  would be running a serious risk of losing it if it were referred to a court for a legal decision. The fact that the majority of the foi&apos;eign Govern- ments who were  consulted have now  returned unsatisfactory replies  appears to increase this risk. The probability that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  would lose their  case does not,  however, appear by any means to be the strongest reason against proceeding further in the matter.  Indeed, the loss of the case respecting Palestine before the Court, would  in itself merely leave matters as they are, and would involve  no greater disadvantage than an expenditure to no purpose  of certain sums in  costs.   But if  His Majesty&apos;s Government  were to pursue  the matter and a case were taken to The Plague Court, there is reason to fear that other  undesirable consequences might well follow.    4.  In  the first place the United  States Government,  in their reply, have not only stated that they do not consider His Majesty&apos;s Government  entitled to grant imperial Preference to Palestine without admitting United States goods                                 * CP. 333 (32).G58G  [7772]
into this  country on similar  conditions,  but  have now  definitely advanced  thevie \ that His Majesty&apos;s Government are  not entitled to  grant preference to anyother mandated territories.  Such  preferences are, in fact, now being granted.There  seems to be little  doubt that if the question of the proposed  grant ofImperial  Preference  for Palestine were referred  to The Plague Court, or even to  the  Permanent Mandates  Commission, efforts would  be made by foreign powers to get  the question, which the United States have raised, of  the grantof  Imperial Preference to other mandated territories settled at the same time.Although the  Law  Officers have advised that His Majesty&apos;s  Government  arelegally justified in the case of these other mandated territories,  the  risk that aninternational court might take another view cannot be ruled out,  and if the Courtdid take such a view, it is possible that a claim to damages might be  put forwardagainst His Majesty&apos;s Government.  The question of  possible damages  was referred to  the Law Officers in connexion  with the Palestine question,  and  they then took  the view that if preferences were granted in a case where His Majesty&apos;&quot;governments  treaty obligations did  not  permit the grant of  preference,  therisk of a claim for damages for breach of treaty would be a serious  one.  In thecase of other  mandated territories, to which  preferences  have  apparently  been accorded for a number of years, such  a claim, if established, might involve HisMajesty&apos;s Government in  an  extremely heavy liability.   If the United states were the Government with which it was decided to litigate at The Hague, thereis little doubt  that  they  would  insist on the question  of the  other  mandated territories being submitted at the same time: while even if it should prove possibleto  get the question of Palestine  submitted  alone,  an  unfavourable  judgmentwould encourage other countries to take His Majesty&apos;s Government to The Haguein regard to what has been done in the case  of the other mandated territories.Even if no other country were anxious to raise the issue,  it is almost certain that italy, who is always on the look out for any attempt on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to treat  mandated territories as  though  they were colonies, would raise the matter and probably  press it successfully.     5.  An even stronger objection to  pursuing the matter further  arises inconnexion with the  question  of  Imperial  Preference  for  the Dominions.  TheForeign Office  consider that a  reference of the Palestine question to The HagueAvould almost certainly encourage foreign countries, and notably the united Statesof  America, to challenge  the  whole principle of Imperial  Preference for. theDominions.   Were this question to be raised, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom might be seriously hampered in presenting their  case  to TheHague Court by  the fact that some at any rate of the Dominions would stronglyobject to many of the reasons  on which His Majesty&apos;s Government would desireto base their case.  This particular aspect of  the question appears to  have beenbrought out in  the  proceedings  of  the  first  meeting  of  the Committee on commercial Relations with Foreign Countries at Ottawa on the 10th August.last.  The  minutes  of these  proceedings  are attached.   The language used by  the  Minister  of  Finance of  the  Union of South  Africa (see paragraph 7of  minutes) makes it very doubtful whether the Union would even  support HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the event of this question being taken up at The Hague.Meanwhile, the independent registration with  the League,  on  the  part of  theUnion,  of certain inter-Imperial agreements,  and the Unions  attitude to  the tentative  representations of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom on  the subject, tend to show that the Union of South Africa, like the Irish FreeState,  does  not share His Majesty&apos;s Governments view that Article  18 of  theCovenant of the League is not applicable to the relations between Members of theCommonwealth.   In fact, what has  passed  at Ottawa  seems  greatly to haveincreased the risks of the situation, and to render it more necessary than before that no action should be taken which might encourage foreign States to challengebefore an international court the grant of Imperial Preference.

SECTION 1.[W 9644/1167/50]                 No.  1.       Mr. Ashton-Givatkin to Sir V. Wellesley.  (Received August 29.)(No.  15.  Confidential.)             Imperial Economic Conference,Dear Wellesley,                                   Ottawa, August 18, 1932.    MY letter No. 12 of the 11th August, paragraph 1.    I  enclose herein  copies  of  the  minutes of Committee (3) commercial relations with  Foreign Countries and  its sub-committee.   The report of thesub-committee has been given to the press,  which has been inclined to  attributespecial importance to the affirmation of the principle that no treaty obligationsinto which  Empire Governments might enter in  the future would be allowed tointerfere with mutual Empire preferences,  and that they would take steps to free  themselves  from  existing treaties,  if incompatible with  the  preferenceprinciple.   Some newspapers have jumped  to the conclusion that this implies awholesale denunciation of our most-favoured-nation treaties.    2.   I  am told that the principal object of  the  Canadian  Government in asking for  this  committee to be set up had  been that it should pass a resolutionemphatically condemning the whole idea and practice of quota restrictions.  Inthe circumstances of the conference, this intention had to be modified, and thepurpose of  the  committee readjusted.                                       Yours ever,                                               E.  ASHTON-GWATKIN.

     1.  For the purposes of organisation, Sir George Perley took the chair andopened the meeting.     2.  It was proposed by Sir George Perley and seconded  by Mr, Thomas thatMr. Flavenga be  elected chairman of the committee.  This was unanimouslyapproved. ;.  ,  3., A statement outlining the view of the Canadian  Government as to thepossible scope of the work of the committee was read by the secretary, and copieswere distributed tp the members of the delegations.     4.  Mr.  Thomas opened  the  discussion by drawing attention to the greatimportance  of the most-favoured-nation clause, and  of maintaining the long-established principle that the grant  of  preferences within the Empire was  amatter of domestic  concern  and could  not be considered a  violation of  amost-favoured-nation agreement with  any foreign State.     5.  Mr. Thomas pointed  out  that certain nations had already disputed theright of the United Kingdom  to deny to them preferences granted to parts of thoEmpire.  He expressed the view thai such foreign criticism might be expected toincrease in  volume  if increased preferences were  granted  as  a result of this conference.     6.  He felt that foreign criticism  could be  met most effectively  if  theGovernments  of the Commonwealth presented a common front, and if. for thispurpose, the conference passed a resolution placing on record the view which hehad indicated.   -  7.  Mr.  Havenga pointed out  that  it was open to  question whether  any resolution of the conference could  affect the rights which foreign countries mightclaim to possess under commercial treaties concluded with parts of the Empire.,The passing of  a  resolution on this subject would probably raise constitutional issues.  So  far  as South Africa  was  concerned, the Government were  takingadequate  steps  to free  their hands in regard to  preferences  granted at this conference.   Further, if any foreign  country challenged the accord of  suchpreferences  as  being  a  contravention   of  most-favoured-nation  rights,  hisGovernment would not hesitate to denounce the treaty in question.     8.  In view of the possibility of constitutional questions becoming involvedit  was agreed that no formal resolution  should be  submitted to the conference.From the  discussion it appeared that each part of the Commonwealth would take all the steps necessary to implement and safeguard whatever preferences mightbe granted at the  conference.     9.  Sir George Perley asked whether the status of the Mandated Territorieshad been considered in connexion  with the questions under discussion.  In replyMr. Runciman said that the problem had arisen only in Palestine, and that theaction taken by the United Kingdom  did hot in any  way affect the Dominions.     10.  Mr.  Guthrie raised  the question of the Danubian treaties, which affectsome 3 per cent, to 4 per cent, of world wheat exports.  Mr. Runciman explainedthat in the discussion at Lausanne the rights of third countries had been expresslyreserved at the instance of the United  Kingdom.     11.   It was agreed that a sub-committee of United Kingdom and&apos; Canadianofficials should be  appointed to prepare a draft report for  consideration.     12.   After  agreeing to reassemble when the  report  is  ready,  the meetingadjourned.

Subject to a few minor: alterations in  the text, the report ofthe sub-committee was accepted, and it is appended  hereto.    The report is recommended to the favourable consideration of the conference.                                           N.  C. HAVENGA, Chairman.
         Enclosure 3 in No. 1.IMPERIAL  ECONOMIC CONFERENCE,  1932.                                  REPORT.          Committee on Commercial Relations with Foreign Countries.     THE committee considered two broad  groups  of questions  affecting  thecommercial relations of the several members  of the Commonwealth with foreigncountries.     In the first place,  the committee  discussed the  general  question  of  the relationship between inter-Commonwealth preferences and  the most-favoured-nation clause in commercial treaties with foreign Powers.  Each Government willdetermine its particular policy in dealing with this matter, but the representativesof the various Governments on the committee stated that it was their policy thatno treaty obligations into which they might enter in the future  should be allowedto interfere with any  mutual preferences which Governments of the Common-wealth might decide to accord to each other, and that they would free themselves from existing treaties, if any, which might  so interfere.  They would,  in fact,take all  the steps necessary to  implement and safeguard whatever preferencesmight be so granted.     In the second  place, attention was drawn to recent tendencies in foreigncountries to conclude  regional  agreements  between themselves for the mutualaccord of  preferences  which  were designed  as being exclusive, and not to beextended  to countries which were not parties to,  or did  not adhere to,  theagreements.  On this point there was a general agreement that foreign countrieswhich had existing treaty obligations to grant most-favoured-nation treatment to the products of particular parts of the Commonwealth could not be allowed to override such obligations by regional agreements of the character  in question.Particular reference was made in this connexion to the question of the DanubianStates in regard to which  preferential treatment  was in contemplation for  the cereal exports of the States concerned exports which constitute a  substantial proportion of the world&apos;s exports of the cereals in question.  The committee were,however,  informed  that in the discussion which took place at Lausanne on  thematter, the rights of third  countries had, at the instance of the  United Kingdom,been expressly reserved.     The committee recognised that  the fact  that rights  are accorded by most-favoured-nation treatment  does  not preclude a foreign country from seeking theconsent of the various  Governments of the British Commonwealth to the waiver of their rights in particular cases, and that these Governments must be guided byconsideration of their individual interests in  deciding whether or not to meet thewishes  of the  foreign country concerned,  so long, however, as  the  general principle that rights of this kind cannot be  arbitrarily withdrawn is fully andcarefully preserved1.     The committee would,  however, recommend that where two or more Common-wealth Governments share a common interest in any proposal for the waiver ofparticular treaty rights, they should consult together with a view to arriving, inso far as possible, at a common policy.
