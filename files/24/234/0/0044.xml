S DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)R E T,595(32).COPY NO.CABINET    PROHIBITION ON THE USE OP CHEMICAL WARFARE.         Memorandum by the Foreign Office.      The Bureau of the Disarmament Conference is at presentdiscussing methods of applying the prohibition on the use of chemical warfare;   and a decision is urgently required on two points on which the United Kingdom Delegate  has been compelled to put in reservations against the view taken bythe other members of the Bureau.     These points concern (l) Retaliation  (2) Sanctions.     (1)  RETALIATION.    All the members of the Bureauexcept the British Delegate are in favour of laying down the rule that a State against which chemical weapons have beenemployed shall in no case retaliate  by the use  of the sameweapons.   It is argued that to permit retaliation would beto weaken the prohibition by making it no longer absoluteand by giving States a legitimate excuse for continuing tomake preparations for chemical warfare.     Three courses appear to be open to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment :-     (a)  to fall in with the view of the other membersof the Bureau and agree to prohibit retaliation.     The objection to this course would appear to be theimprobability of such a prohibition being observed inpractice.   As Mr. Baldwin stated in the House of commons on November 10th:-  &quot;If a man has a potential weapon and
                                                          9 n a                                                \   &quot;has his hack to the wall and is going to he killed, he will   use that weapon whatever it is and whatever undertaking he   has given ahout it.   Experience has shown us that the stern   test of war will break down all conventions.&quot;     (b)  To state that we hold that, while rigorously main-taining the prohibition against chemical warfare, we are unableto undertake that we should not in the last resort be compelledto have recourse to it if it were used against us.     This is open to the objections indicated above, i.e. thatwe shall be placed in a position of isolation, and that it willbe represented   that we are the obstacle to placing an absoluteban on the use of chemical warfare.     (c)  Tc say that we could only agree to a prohibition onretaliation if we were satisfied (i) that such measures of supervision could be imposed as would prevent preparationsenabling chemical warfare tc be used against us cn any consider-able scale,and (ii) that a violation of the prohibition would call down on the head of the offender such effective sanctionson the part of other States that retaliation on the part of the victim would be superfluous.     The objection to this course, which appears the mostlogical, is that we have always shown reluctance either toaccept strict measures of supervision or to agree to collectivesanctions.   If we take this line, we shall expose ourselves tolegitimate reproach on this score,- and shall have great diffi-culty in resisting future pressure to agree to wide measures of supervision and to collective sanctions.
     (2)  SANCTIONS.   The text on which the Bureau is now-working is as follows     1,  &quot;It will he the duty of third States individually   to take coersive measures to he determined in accordance   with the circumstances and in particular with the   situation in which each State is placed in regard to the   belligerents to induce the State which has used chemical   etc. arms to abandon use of such arms or to prevent it   from continuing such use.&quot;     2.  &quot;Consultation of third States through the medium   of the Disarmament Commission will take place in the   shortest period to determine measures to be taken in   common and to decide on collective sanctions of all   kinds to be applied.   Such decisions will he taken by   the Disarmament Commission by a majority (to be specified   by the Conference) of its members;  the minority will net   be bound by such  decision but will undertake not to   obstruct the action contemplated.&quot;    3. &quot;Third States belonging to a particular region may   moreover pledge themselves to undertake urgent common   action of a rigorous and effective nature against a   guilty State and  to constitute for this purpose a   collective force  of police in advance.&quot;     This text appears to have been unanimously accepted bythe Bureau subject to the reservation of the british delegation, except as regards point  3, which has beenobjected to by the Italian Delegation.   The provision in paragraph 2 of the text by which a minority cannot be bound by the decision of the majority of the Commission                            -3-
Q f-j oto apply collective sanctions was no doubt designed to makethe proposal more palatable to us.   It has, however,certain disadvantages from both points of view.   On theone hand, it might be extremely difficult for us to casta vote against the use of collective sanctions in aflagrant case, merely on the ground that we did not wishto participate in them ourselves, and unless we votedwith the minority we should not be exempt from the obligation.On the other hand, the fact that the minority is not boundvery much detracts from the utility and effectiveness ofthe sanctions, since cases might well occur in which the minority included all or most of the States which were actually in a position to apply them.     It v/ill, however, be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make out any case for refusing to considerthe principle of sanctions for violations of the prohibition on chemical warfare, and the text before the Bureau ismore acceptable to us than might have been expected or than is likely to emerge from any new discussion of the matter at Geneva.                        (Sgd.)  ROBERT VANSITTART.                            for the Secretary of State for                                   Foreign Affairs.Foreign Office, S.W.1,   November 15th, 1932.
