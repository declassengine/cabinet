Memorandum &quot;by the President  of  the Board of Trade.     My colleagues will remember  that  I undertook to lookfurther into the question whether anything  could be done  to mitigate the disndvantages of  the Ottawa Agreements toBrazilian exports, more particularly oranges.     The following table shows the  value of the principal                            Oarticles imported into the United Kingdom from Brazil during recent years (retained imports)1927.  173,685281,365 29,019548,974284,939101,060938,984 20,774110,783174,261 1928.   j   1929.________4--_______1930.-f- I.4.1931.ptnas, r aw.......  used as fruit.296,890;   449,125[ges, raw.............  r, unrefined......... f, chilled and frozen.  , all other kinds xcept poultry andHu^ /******************* [ton, raw amd linters..

The last two of these  commodities  are at  present-1-
free of duty.  Of these articles nuts are subject only tothe general ad valorem duty of 10% and our freedom of actionin regard to this duty is in no way affected by any of the ottawa Agreements.  Bananas, which were formerly dutiable at10/1 ad valorem, are now In pursuance of the Ottawa ConferenceBill to be dutiable at the rate of 2/6d. per cwt,  According tomy information there is little difference in fact between thetwo rates, though I understand that the Brazilians contend thatthe change involves an increase of duty on the cheaperbananas such as Brazil supplies.     As to oranges - under the trade agreement with SouthAfrica the United Kingdom are pledged to the imposition of a duty of 3/6d. per cwt. (equivalent to about 15% to 17% ad valorem) on oranges during the months April to Novemberinclusive in each year.  This specific duty replaces duringthis season of the year the 10% ad valorem duty which hashitherto been in force throughout the year and which willcontinue In force during the remainder of the year.  The effect is that during the season of the year in which South Africanoranges are imported the duty on foreign oranges is increased bysome 5/o to 7% ad valorem.     Imports of oranges from Bi&apos;azil during each month of1931 were as follows:-                                        &apos;000 cv/ts.January ............        -February............March,..............April...............        10May.................        93June................

9 9 9wo i         It will &quot;be  seen  that on  the basis of 1931 figures the    whole of the Brazilian trade  in oranges will be subject to the    increased  duty except some  comparatively small Imports in    December.   Oranges  from  Spain, Italy and Palestine are imported    in  large quantities in December and it is therefore doubtful    whether Brazil would  secure any advantage by attempting to delay    shipments  till that month.  It is also difficult to see that    there would be any  advantage  to Brazil if the duty were to be    imposed all the  year  round, since Brazilian oranges are not    competitive with the  Spanish  and other foreign oranges which    enter the  United Kingdom in the winter months.  It seems,    therefore,  Impossible within  the terms of the agreement v/ith    South Africa, to make any adjustment of the duties on oranges    which could lighten the  burden for Brazil.         It will be  seen, however, from the table given above that    while the  imports of  oranges  have increased rapidly in recent    years they still form only a  moderate proportion (about one-    fifth) of  Brazilian imports into the United Kingdom and there    remains a  substantial balance of commodities in regard to which    our hands  are not tied by the Ottawa arrangements.  As regards    meat, it may be  possible to give some assurance as to the extent    of  the limitation of  foreign  Imports which our policy necessitates      and we should at least  be prepared to guarantee Brazil against    the imposition of any duty on her meat.  A similar guarantee could    be  given in regard  to raw cotton.  These two commodities taken    together account for  about half of the imports from Brazil into    the United Kingdom, whilst some concessions in regard to less    important  commodities such as nuts, etc., might also prove of    interest to her.                                              W.R.ard of Trade,    7th November, 1932.                                  -3-
