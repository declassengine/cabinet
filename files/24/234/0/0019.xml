[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;.)&quot;^ RET.                                                COPY NO.  C\.P. 3^Q/i )                  CABINET.DISARMAMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air with              regard to CP. 360(32).          I have read the Foreign Secretary^ Memorandum with interest.  While I welcome the general thesis contained in thedeclaration of policy, and agree with what I take to be the essence of sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 in the explanatory note on AirArmaments, I cannot agree that the &quot;internationalisation&quot; ofCivil Aviation is practicable,     2,   There are certain other important particulars to which Iwisli to draw attention:-    (i)   The proposal to refuse Germany  &quot;examples1 of air       armaments (whilst conceding her examples of the other       forbidden weapons) is somewhat inconsistent and seems to       me to play into the hands of the extremists in Germany by       giving them an oppotunity to refuse acoeptance of proposals     which they would otherwise have great difficulty in       refusings,  I would add that the concession of  &quot;specimens1       of military aircraft to Germany woiild introduce no new       menace since they already possess  large numbers of civil       aircraft suitable for warlike purposes, and facilities for       manufacturing military aircrafte    (ii)   The proposal to reduce the unladen weight of all       military and civil aircraft to 650 kilos  (troop carriers       and seaplanes excepted) means the  scrapping of all       military and naval aircraft at present  in existence. This       would inevitably  involve  the rejection  of the proposal by       the United States, France and many other  countries.  It is       suggested that  if a  limiting figure  is  to be mentioned, it       should be tnat upon which provisional agreement was       reached during  tne private conversations with  the French       and Americans at  Geneva,  viz. 3,000  kilos, with an       indication of acceptance  of a lower  figure  subject to       general agreement,      3,   In view of these  considerations, and  because the openingstatement contained in the  note  on Air Armaments is slightly  at variance  with tne facts,  I  suggest that  the note be redrafted asfollows:-      &quot; (3) Air Armaments.                 &quot;^he  only  completely satisfactory  method  of           dealing with  the menace  to the civil  population  of           bombing from  the air  is  the  entire  abolition  of  the           means  of carrying  out air bombardment;  but,  as  this            ideal would involve  the  suppression of  all civil air-            craft  (as  wall  as  the abolition  of  military end  naval            aircraft),  it must be regarded as  impracticable.           Alternatively,  it  has been  suggested  that  it  might be            possible  to subject  civil  aviation to such            international regulation   as  would prevent its misuse            for  warlike purposes.
1 Git/.&apos;./Air Ministry,29th October, 1932.L.          &quot;If at the present moment complete agreement cannot be     achieved on so drastic a proposal as the abolition of     military and naval aircraft and the imposition of an effective     international regime for civil aviation, His Majesty&apos;s     Government must press for:-           (i)  an immediate reduction of the air forces of the                leading Powers to the level of those of the                United Kingdom;          (ii)  a subsequent cut of       all round on the                air forces of the world - those of Great Britain                included;         (iii)  a limitation on the unladen weight of military                and naval aircraft to 3000 kilos (troop carriers                and seaplanes excepted) or such lesser limit as                may be agreed upon.          &quot;The adoption of these limits could be followed by a     thorough examination of the problems involved in the     complete abolition of military and naval aircraft, and of     the practicability of an effective international regulation     of civil aviation.&quot;     4.  The proposal for a 33-j^  cut may cause greatembarrassment to some of the Dominions, other nations whose airforces are in an embryonic state, and to India.   I therefore suggest that their position should be safeguarded in whatevermanner the Foreign Secretary may think desirable.
