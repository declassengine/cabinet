IMPERIAL  ECONOMIC  CONFERENCE,            AT  OTTAWA,  1932.            I.-OPENING OF  THE CONFERENCE.   THE Conference was  opened by  His Excellency the  Governor-General of Canada, who first delivered a gracious message from HisMajesty the King, which was in the following terms :        &apos;&apos; My thoughts  and prayers are  with  the delegates  of  my   Governments who  are  gathered in Conference to-day,  to explore   the means by which they may promote the prosperity of the Peoples   of  this great Empire.       At  this Conference you are opening a new page of history, on   which, within a few weeks, will be written  the record of a deter-   mined.effort to solve the difficulties weighing so heavily, not only   on  us, but upon the whole world.   It is my earnest  hope  that   when this  Conference rises  there  will be a record  of results   worthily reflecting  the  frankness, the sincerity, and the spirit of   helpfulness with which, I feel confident, your deliberations will   be conducted.       The British Empire is based on the  principle of co-operation,   and it is now your common purpose to give the fullest possible effect   to  that principle in the  economic sphere.  By so doing you will set   in  motion beneficial forces within the British Commonwealth which   may well extend their impulse also to the world at large.   I pray   that you may  be given clear insight and strength of purpose for   these ends.                                               GEOBGE B.I.&quot;   21st July, 1932.

The reports of these  Committees are printed in Cmd. 4175, butthe  action  taken  thereon  by   the   Conference  is  set  forth  on pages 9-18 of this volume.

The total number of meetings was : Plenary Conference, 5; Headsof Delegations, 5; Committees and Sub-Committees, 49.   In addition to the committees and sub-committees  of the Con-ference, there were many special groups dealing  with inter-delegationmatters, particularly matters related to the negotiation of trade agree-ments.

s   The following gracious reply, from His Majesty, was received and read by the Chairman at the close of the proceedings :        &quot;I appreciate very much the message  which the  representa-   tives of the Governments of the British Commonwealth have sent   to me on the termination of the Ottawa Conference.   The Queen   and I thank them  all  most sincerely  for  their expression of   devotion  and good wishes.   Your  work has  been arduous  and   intricate, but I rejoice to  think that your achievement has justified   the high expectations  with which the Conference began, and that   you have  been  able  not only  to  conclude  important practical   agreements for the promotion of trade within the British Empire,   but also to  adopt principles to help its future development.       &quot; I am confident that  the results of your labours, and the spirit   of co-operation and mutual helpfulness which  has brought  about   their success, will be of real benefit to my peoples.      &quot; I wish  you all  Godspeed,  and a safe and happy journey   homeward.                                              GEORGE R.I.&quot;
                SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS.   THE conclusions of  the Conference may  be  summarised  asfollows:(a) Resolutions  and Statements regarding  the  Promotion  of  Trade                    within  the  Commonwealths                       (i) EMPIRE CONTENT.   With regard to the determination of the percentage of EmpireContent  necessary  to  secure  preferential  tariff  treatment,  theConference draws the  attention of the several  Governments of theCommonwealth to the importance  of this subject, and  recommends that  each  of  the  Governments  of  the   Commonwealth  shouldinvestigate,  as  rapidly as possible, the standard of Empire Contentwhich should be  required by them for the import under preferential rates  of the different classes of goods, bearing in mind the  following principles :    (a) That though it must rest with each Government to decide what          standard it  will require, a greater degree of uniformity          throughout the Commonwealth is  desirable;    (b) The  standard required  should not  be such as  to  defeat or          frustrate the  intention  of  the preferential  rate of duty          conceded to any class of goods.         (ii) EXPORT BOUNTIES AND ANTI-DUMPING  DUTIES.    With regard to the question of export bounties and anti-dumping duties  within  the  Commonwealth,   the  Conference   adopted thefollowing resolution :       This  Conference,  recognizing   that  export  bounties  and    exchange  depreciation  adversely  affect  the  value  of   tariff    preferences within the Commonwealth,  expresses the hope that    with a rise in the  level of  commodity prices and with  stabilized    exchanges such bounties and the special duties  which have been    adopted as a  means of adjusting the situation so created, may be    withdrawn.                     (iii) TRADE AGREEMENTS.    With  regard  to  the conclusion of  certain  Agreements for theextension of mutual trade by means of reciprocal  preferential tariffs,the Conference adopted the following resolution :       The nations of the British Commonwealth having entered into    certain Agreements with one another for the extension of mutual    trade by means of reciprocal preferential tariffs, this Conference    takes note of these Agreements and records its conviction;   * The Report of the  Committee  on the  Promotion  of Trade  within theCommonwealth is printed on p. 18 of Cmd. 4175.
       That by the lowering or removal of barriers among themselves   provided for in these  Agreements, the flow of trade between the   various countries of the Empire will be facilitated, and  that by the   consequent increase  of  purchasing power of  their peoples, the   trade of the world will also be stimulated and increased;       Further,  that this Conference regards the conclusion of these   Agreements  as a  step forward,  which should  in the  future lead   to further progress in the same direction, and which  will utilize   protective  duties to ensure  that  the  resources and industries of   the Empire are developed  on sound economic lines.       The  Agreements  referred  to  are annexed hereto  and the   Conference commends them to  the  Governments  of  the  several   parts of the  Empire.&quot;         (b) Resolutions regarding  Customs Administration.!   The Conference recommends that the  aims to be kept  in  viewshould be :     (i) The avoidance of uncertainty as to the amount of  duty which          would be payable on  the  arrival of goods in the importing          country;    (ii) The reduction of friction and delay  to a minimum;   (iii) The  provision of facilities  for the  expeditious and  effective          settlement of disputes relating to all matters affecting the          application of the Customs Tariff;and  that any measures which  Customs  Administrations  might take to safeguard  themselves against evasion should  be  consistent withthese principles.   (o) Statement regarding Commercial Relations with Foreign                            Countries.!   The Conference considered two broad groups of questions affectingthe commercial relations of the several members of  the  Common-wealth with foreign countries.   In the first place, the Conference discussed the general questionof the relationship between  inter-Commonwealth preferences and themost-favoured-nation clause  in commercial  treaties  with foreign powers.   Each Government will determine  its particular  policy indealing with  this  matter,  but  the  representatives of the various governments on the Committee stated  that  it was their policy that   * The texts  of the Agreements  between  the  United Kingdom and  theDominions, India and Southern Ehodesia  are given in Appendices I to  VII inthis volume.  Agreements to which the United Kingdom is not a party are  noiincluded in the present print.   f  The  Reports  of  the Committees  on Customs  Administration   and commercial Relations with Foreign  Countries are printed on pp.  22  and 2-1respectively of Cmd. 4175.
no  treaty obligations  into  which they  might  enter  in the futureshould be allowed to interfere with  any mutual preferences which governments of the Commonwealth might  decide to accord to  eachother,  and that they would free  themselves  from existing  treaties,if any, which might so interfere.  They would, in fact, take all the steps  necessary to  implement  and safe-guard whatever preferencesmight be  so granted.   In  the second place,  attention was  drawn  to recent tendenciesin foreign countries to conclude regional agreements between them-selves  for the  mutual  accord  of preferences  which  were  designed as being exclusive,  and not to be extended to countries which  werenot parties to,  or did not adhere to the  agreements.   On this point,there  was a general agreement  that foreign countries which  hadexisting treaty  obligations to grant most-favoured-nation treatment to the products of particular parts of the Commonwealth could notbe allowed to override such obligations  by regional  agreements ofthe character  in question.   Particular reference was  made in  this&quot;connection to the question of the  Danubian  States in regard to whichpreferential  treatment was  in  contemplation  for the  cereal exportsof the  States  concerned exports  which  constitute   a substantial proportion of the world&apos;s exports of the cereals in  question.   TheConference were,  however, informed  that  in the discussion which took place at Lausanne on  the matter, the rights of third  countries had, at the instance of the United Kingdom, been expressly reserved.   The Conference recognized  that the fact that rights are accordedby  most-favoured-nation treatment  does  not  preclude  a  foreign country from  seeking the  consent of  the  various  Governments ofthe British Commonwealth to the waiver of their rights in particular cases, and that these Governments must be guided by considerationof their individual interests in deciding whether or not to  meet thewishes of the foreign country  concerned, so  long,  however, as thegeneral principle that rights of this kind cannot be arbitrarily with-drawn is  fully and  carefully preserved.   The Conference would,  however,  recommend that  where two ormore  Commonwealth Governments share a common interest in anyproposal  for the  waiver of particular  treaty rigRts,  they should consult together  with a view to arriving,  in  so far as possible, ata common policy.(d) Resolutions and  Statements  regarding Monetary  and  Financial                            Questions. *                                I.   (a) A  rise  throughout the world in the general levels of whole-sale prices is  in the highest degree  desirable.  The  evil of fallingprices  must be attacked by Government  and individual  action inall its causes,  whether political, economic, financial or monetary.   (b) For  dealing  with the problem  in  its  widest aspects  theGovernments represented at this  Conference  record their conviction   * The Beport of the Committee on Monetary and  Financial Questions is printed on  p. 27 of Cmd. 4175.
that international action is  urgently necessary, and announce their desire to co-operate with other nations in any practicable measures for raising wholesale  prices.    (c)  The Conference has  considered what  action can be taken bythe nations of the Commonwealth to help towards raising prices.    As regards monetary factors,  the Conference  recognizes that thecentral position of the United Kingdom, not only among the countries of the  Commonwealth but  in world  trade and finance,  makes  theUnited Kingdom a main factor in anything that  can be done.  TheConference,  therefore, welcomes the  following statement made onbehalf   of  the  United  Kingdom  by  the  Chancellor   of   theExchequer:       &quot;His  Majesty&apos;s Government desire to see wholesale  sterling    prices rise.   The best condition for this would be  a rise in  gold    prices, and the absence of a rise in gold prices inevitably  imposes    limitations on what can be  done  for sterling. A  rise in prices    cannot be effected by monetary action alone,  since  various other    factors which have combined to bring about the present depression    must also be modified or removed before a  remedy is assured.    His   Majesty&apos;s  Government,  nevertheless,   recognize  that an    ample supply of  short-term  money at low  rates  may  have  a    valuable  influence, and they are confident that the efforts which    have successfully brought about the present favourable monetary    conditions can and will, unless unforeseen difficulties arise, be    continued.&quot;    (d)  The  Conference  recommends  the other countries  of  theCommonwealth  represented  here to act in conformity  with  the lineof  policy as set out  in  the statement  of  the  Chancellor of  theExchequer, so  far as  lies within their power.    In  the monetary  sphere the primary line of  action towards  arise in  prices should  be the creation  and maintenance, within thelimits  of sound  finance,  of such  conditions as  will  assist in  the revival  of enterprise  and trade.  Among these  conditions  are  lowrates of interest and  an abundance of short-term money.  Whileregard must  be had to the different conditions applying to various types of loans,  the rate  of  interest for all purposes  should  be  keptas  low  as financial  conditions  permit.   At the  same  time it isnecessary that  these  favourable monetary conditions  be achieved,not  by the inflationary creation of  additional  means of  payment to finance public expenditure, but by an orderly monetary policy,safeguarded,  if  the  necessity should  arise,  by  such  steps as  willrestrain and circumscribe  the scope of  violent speculative movements in commodities or securities.    It must be kept in mind, however, that the success of any  suchpolicy will be hampered  and might  be nullified by  the  failure tomodify  or remove important non-monetary obstacles.  Of the  non-monetary factors which are depressing the level  of prices  many areof  international  character  and  require  an  international  remedy.
The  nations  of  the Commonwealth  should,  nevertheless, take  allsteps that lie in  their power to increase public confidence, especiallyin the  field of business enterprise, and  to  facilitate trade.   (e)  The Conference recognizes  the  great  importance  to  tradersof stability of exchange rates over as wide an area as possible.  Thecomplete  solution of  this problem must await  the restoration  of conditions for the satisfactory working  of an international standardas referred   to  below.  In  the meanwhile,  and  pending  such asolution, this Conference  has considered  the possibility of achievingvaluable results  in two  directions first by  creating an  area  of stability among  countries regulating their currencies in relation to sterling;  and secondly,  by avoiding wide day-to-day fluctuationsbetween sterling and  gold.   As  regards the latter,  the Conference has noted with satisfaction that the United Kingdom has  already established machinery aimed at preventing wide fluctuations  in  the gold value of sterling causedby  speculative  movements.   As  to  the  former,   the Conferencerecognizes the  value  of  the countries   within the Commonwealthwhose  currencies are linked to sterling maintaining  stability between their exchange  rates  and looks to a rise in the  general  level of wholesale prices as the  most  desirable  means for  facilitating this result.                               II.   The  Conference recognizes  that  the  ultimate aim  of monetary policy   should  be  the restoration  of  a satisfactory  international monetary standard.   Such a  standard  should  so  function as  notmerely to maintain stable exchange rates between all countries,  butalso to ensure the smooth  and efficient working of the  machineryof international  trade  and finance.   This postulates international agreement among the  great tradingnations of the world, and  while certain of the  States here representedhold very definite views on  the question  of  the  most desirablestandard, the Conference refrains from making any  recommenda-tions on the  subject in view of the fact that the  question is shortly to be discussed at an international conference.  There are, however,several conditions  precedent to the  re-establishment  of  any  inter-national monetary  standard.  The  most important among them are :a  rise  in the  general level of commodity  prices in the  various countries to  a  height more in  keeping with  the  level of  costs,including the burden of debt and other fixed and  semi-fixed charges;and an adjustment of the factors  political, economic,  financial and monetary, which  have caused  the breakdown of the  gold  standardin many countries, and which, if not adjusted, would inevitably leadto another breakdown of whatever  international standard  may beadopted.   It is also  in  the view  of the Conference of  the utmost  importanceto the  future working of any international standard that international
co-operation  should be  secured and maintained  with  a view  to avoiding,  so  far  as  may  be  found practicable,  wide fluctuations  inthe purchasing power of the standard of value. (e) Resolutions  and  Statements regarding  Methods  of  Economic                          Co-operation.                      (i) General Resolutions.   This  Conference,  having discussed  the  question  of  EconomicConsultation  and  Co-operation within the Commonwealth, and  haviiigconsidered the annexed report*  prepared for it  on the constitution and functions of existing agencies operating in these fields :       Recommends  that a committee should be appointed  forthwith,   consisting of  not more than  two representatives of each  of  the   participating Governments, to consider the means of  facilitating   economic   consultation and  co-operation between the   several   Governments  of  the Commonwealth, including a  survey  of  the   functions,  organization  and   financial   bases  of  the  agencies   specified  in the  annexed report, *  and an  examination of what   alterations or  modifications, if any, in the existing machinery for   such co-operation within the Commonwealth are desirable.       The Conference further  recommends that  it  shall  be  an   instruction to  the Committee to  elect their own Chairman from   among their members, and to report to the several Governments   represented thereon not later than the 81st May next, with a view   to the consideration of their  report by the several Governments   not later than September  1988.   The Conference was given to understand by the representatives ofthe United Kingdom that, in order that the necessary  time might beavailable for  the  preparation and consideration of the report of  theCommittee concerning the  existing and future machinery for economic co-operation  within  the Commonwealth,  the  Government  of  theUnited Kingdom  would continue to furnish any funds  which may berequired  to finance  essential work of  the Empire  Marketing Boarddown to  the  end  of  September  1983.   The Conference  records itsdeep appreciation of the action of the United Kingdom in this respect.   With regard to the above recommendations reservations were madeby Mr. Havenga,  for the Union of South Africa, and by Mr. Lemass,for the Irish  Free State, respectively, in the  following terms :        (Mr.  Havenga):  &quot;While not  wishing to  object  to  the   acceptance  of the  report  of the  Committee  on Methods  of   Economic Co-operation, I desire, in. order to  remove any  ground   for misapprehension,  to  record   the following  reservations on   behalf of the Union of  South Africa :       &quot;1. While not  generally adverse to the institution of  ad hoc   bodies for economic  investigation and  preparation,  the  Union   * Appendix  5 to the  Report  of the Committee on  Methods of economic co-operation (see p. 53 in Cmd. 4175).
   Government will not associate  itself  with any  scheme  for  tne   erection  of  any  organization   in  the nature  of a  permanent   secretariat  or  preparatory  committee to  Commonwealth Con   ferences, whether economic or otherwise.      &quot;2. That  portion of  the  report which introduces the draft   resolutions relating to&apos;the appointment of a Committee to consider   the means of facilitating economic  consultation  and co-operation,   must  not be read in the sense that  the  Union Government  is   committed in principle to give financial support to Commonwealth   Economic Organizations.&quot;       (Mr. Lemass) :  &quot;I do not object to the  adoption  of  this   report and the accompanying resolutions, but I wish it to be made   perfectly clear in the published records of the Conference that the   Government of the Irish Free  State are not prepared to  contem-   plate  the setting up of an  Imperial Economic  Secretariat or  of   any similar organ of centralization.&quot;       (ii) Resolution concerning Industrial Standardization^   I. The Conference recommends that, with a view to assisting theco-ordination of the work  of national  standardization, the following principles, as far as practicable, be observed:   (o) That the specifications should be in accordance with the needs          of industry and  fulfil a  generally recognized want;   (b) That the community interest of producer and consumer should          be maintained throughout;   (e) That the specifications should be arrived at by general consent;   (d) That periodical  review and revision should be undertaken  to          prevent crystallization and  keep the specifications abreast          of progress;   (e) That full information regarding the initiation of any specifica-          tion and progress in its preparation should, without delay,          be circulated by the  originating body to the corresponding          bodies in other parts of the Commonwealth.   II. Having regard  to  the disadvantages  which  are apt  to occurwhen a statutory provision embodies a standard specification verbatim,whether  in whole  or in part, instead of confining itself to a referenceto a  national standard specification, the Conference recommends that each Government of the  Commonwealth in co-operation  with  itscentral standardizing body,  should bring under review the  position with regard to  such statutory provisions,  in order that it  may  bepossible  to keep these standards  in line with industrial and  scientificprogress without the necessity of fresh legislation.   III.  With a view to facilitating the general  adoption of  standardspecifications throughout  the Commonwealth, the Conference recom-mends that  the Governments concerned take into favourable  con-   * The Report of the Sub-Committee on Industrial Standardization is printedon p. 39  of Cmd. 4175.
siderafcion the provision of free entry to standard specifications andother documents circulated between the  central standardizing bodies.   IV. In order to provide the various  parts  of the Commonwealthwith an  accurate  means of exchange of colour information and tosecure a basic standard in trade practice, the Conference recommends that each central standardizing body should at  an early date considerthe issue of a standard schedule of colours.   V.  As an immediate step towards the promotion of intra-Common-wealth trade through the adoption of commercial standard specifica-tions, the Conference recommends that, in respect of  steel,  timber,industrial chemical  products  and  replaceable  parts of  agricultural implements and machinery, immediate steps be taken by the centralstandardizing hodies in those parts of the Commonwealth affected tosecure a greater degree of uniformity in standard specifications andtrade practices.   VI. t With a view to the employment of common standard specifica-tions for aircraft materials and component parts, and particularly themethod of testing  therein specified, the Conference recommends thatthe national standardizing bodies  in those parts of the Commonwealthparticularly concerned, should  co-operate directly  with this object in view.   VII.  The Conference, taking  note of  the observation contained inthe last paragraph of the Eeport of the Conference on Standardizationaccepted  by  the  Imperial Conference   of  1980,  which  reads asfollows :        &quot; Apart from day to day consideration of matters of detail, we   are impressed  with the desirability of readier means of consulta-   tion on questions of policy than are afforded by the past, or by   occasional conferences such as the present,&quot;is impressed with the  desirability of obviating the difficulties and delays which inevitably occur under existing conditions in conductingconsultations between the central standardizing bodies in the various parts of  the British Commonwealth  of  Nations,  and the misunder-standings which occasionally arise due to the distances between thecorrespondents and to the subject matter  of the communications.    The Conference recommends  that  for the  purpose of maintainingcloser liaison in these matters the central standardizing bodies in thedifferent  parts of  the Commonwealth should be authorised to calltogether,  periodically or otherwise, representatives in their respective countries of the corresponding bodies,  or persons otherwise designatedfor the purpose.    The Conference further suggests that such an arrangement might include a provision whereby the  Trade Commissioners  maintained in  different parts of the  Empire by  the  several commonwealth governments should, as occasion requires,  be available to act asLiaison  Officers for  this purpose.   The  Conference considers thatit should be made clear that  such consultations are purely supple-
mentary to, and not intended in any way to  supplant, the methodof direct  communication already  established between the  centralstandardizing  bodies.       (iii) Grading  and Standards  of  Agricultural Products.   The report of the Sub-Committee on  this subject, which is setforth as Appendix 2 to the  Eeport of the  Committee on Methods ofEconomic Co-operation,* was approved by the Conference.        (iv) Resolutions concerning Industrial Co-operationA   This Conference, having  examined the  Eeport of  the ImperialEconomic  Committee on Imperial  Industrial  Co-operation, i  findsitself in general  agreement  with the tenor of  the  Eeport.   The  Eeport  makes  it   clear  that industrial production  has developed  and will  continue to develop  in  the  less  industrializedparts of the Commonwealth.  These developments involve changesin the  economic structure  both of  the more industrialized  and ofthe  less industrialized Countries;  and the Conference  notes with approval the view of the Committee that:  &quot; the object of co-opera-tion  is not, and must not be, to arrest change, but wisely to direct and  facilitate  its course.&quot;   It should,  in the opinion of  the Conference, be the  object of any policy of industrial co-operation within  the Commonwealth  to  securethe best division of industrial activities among the several parts ofthe Commonwealth  and  the ordered economic development of eachpart, with  a view to ensuring the maximum efficiency  and economy of production  and distribution.   It is further the view of the Conference that  the precise nature and  extent of the  co-operation to be  achieved  in any  particular industry must largely depend  upon effective consultation between those engaged,  or proposing to  engage,  in that industry in  any two or  more parts of the Commonwealth.   The Conference  therefore recommends  to the  various industries in which conditions are suitable for the purpose, the desirability ofmaking arrangements for such consultation at the earliest possible date;  but  it  records  its belief that such  consultation, to be fully effective, should be  conducted between  responsible persons or bodiesadequately  representative   of the  industry  in  each  part  of  theCommonwealth  concerned.   The  Conference  further recommends  that  the  Governmentsconcerned  facilitate and assist such consultations by all availablemeans.   The Conference  further  recommends that, without prejudice totheir liberty to  determine  their own general economic policies, theGovernments  of  the Commonwealth  should  give   sympathetic   *  See p. 45 of Cmd. 4175.   \  The Report of the  Committee on Methods of Economic  Co-operation is printed on p. 48 of Cmd. 4175.

consideration to any proposals which may be directed towards giving effect to the  principle  of industrial co-operation  and which  may  beput before them by responsible parties representing similar industrial interests in  the  parts of  the Commonwealth  affected.   In thisconnection the Conference would  draw attention  to the  importanceof taking into consideration  the interests  of other parts of  theCommonwealth which  might  be  affected by  such proposals.           (v)  Resolution concerning Films and  Radio.   The Conference takes note of the suggestions contained in  theReport  upon  Films and Radio submitted to it by the  Committee  on methods of  Economic  Co-operation,&quot; and commends  them for  theconsideration of the Governments represented at the Conference.   * Appendix 4 to the Report of the  Committee on Methods of economic co-operation (see p. 50 in Cmd. 4175). .

                                SCHEDULE  H.               DECLARATION BY UNITED  KINGDOM GOVERNMENT.   1.  The present wholesale prices of  frozen  meat are at a level which hnsresulted in grave depression in the  livestock industries of the United Kingdomand  the  Dominions.  This  depression is likely,  if continued, to  bring abouta serious decline in production and consequent ultimate injury to the consumer.   2.  Such  a position  is so serious that it is essential to  take whatever stepsmay appear feasible to  raise the  wholesale prices of frozen meat in the UnitedKingdom  market to such a level as will maintain efficient production.   3.  With  a  view to the  earliest possible improvement  of the position, HisMajesty&apos;s Government  in  the United  Kingdom  will,  during the  currency  ofthe Ottawa Agreement, arrange for the regulation of importations  of  meat intothe United Kingdom, the regulation, in  view  of the close  inter-relationship ofall  kinds  of  meat  in  determining the  price  level, to be applied to all  themeats  referred  to  in Section 5.   4.  The policy of His   Majesty&apos;s Government in the  United   Kingdom  inrelation to meat production is,  first, to secure development  of home  produc-tion, and, secondly, to give to the Dominions an expanding share of  imports into the  United Kingdom.   5.  In order to co-operate  with His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom  in  the carrying   out&apos; of this  policy. His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  inthe Commonwealth of  Australia  agrees  to limit the export of frozen mutton and  lamb to the United Kingdom for the  year 1933 to  an amount equivalentto the  total imports from Australia  during the year ended  the 30th June, 1932,in consideration of  the United  Kingdom  Government    (a)  Arranging for the  regulation of the  importation  of  foreign  meat  in         accordance with a programme  (hereinafter referred to as  the &quot; agreed         programme &quot;) agreed  between  His  Majesty&apos;s   Government in  the         United  Kingdom  and  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  Common-         wealth of  Australia  and  including  within its  scope Frozen  Mutton         and Lamb, Frozen Beef and Chilled Beef.   (b)  Arranging,  as soon  as possible after receiving  the  Report  of the Com-         mission now  sitting on the  reorganisation  of  the  Pig  Industry  in         the United Kingdom, for the  quantitative regulation of  the  supplies         of bacon  and hams coming on to the  United  Kingdom  market.   (c)  Undertaking  that no restriction   will  be  placed  upon  the importation         of  any meat  from Australia during  the period named  in the agreed         programme referred  to in Section  5  (a) of this Declaration.   6.  During  the  year 1933 and in the light  of the experience  gained,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in  the United  Kingdom  will consider, in  consultationwith His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  Commonwealth  of Australia, the best means of  ensuring an improved price situation and the more orderly  marketing of supplies.   7.  Should no permanent policy be agreed  upon as  the  result of the consul-tation  referred to above, His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the  United Kingdomundertakes,  after  the  expiry of  the period named  in the agreed programmereferred  to in  Section  5 (a) of this Declaration and during the  remainder ofthe period of the Agreement concluded  at  Ottawa     (a)  To arrange  for  the  continuance, unless otherwise  agreed  between the          Governments concerned, of the regulation of the imports  of foreign          meat at the  rates in force at the  end  of the period named in the         agreed programme.
                                                                          9                                                                          t)                                    55Australia  (contd.).

Should it appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdomafter enquiry  that, at any  time  in consequence of a restriction upon  foreignimports, the supplies  of meat of  any kind are  inadequate to meet the require-ments  of consumers in  the  United Kingdom, then His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentmay remove  any such restriction until supplies  are  again adequate.The  Agreed  Programme  referred to in Section 5  (a)  of  the  Declaration  by                       United Kingdom  Government.

Copy of letter  referred to  in Article  4  of Agreement.                                     New Zealand Delegation,Dear Mr. Baldwin,                      Ottawa, Canada, August  19, 1932.   I HAVE given further consideration  to the matter of an agreement between his  Majesty &apos;s Government  in the United Kingdom  and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in New  Zealand.  In my  conversations with  you and  your  Ministerswe have agreed  that a policy will be adopted that will have  for  its definiteobjective the two-fold purpose of raising the price  of meat to  a remunerativelevel and of progressively increasing the share of  the Dominions in the UnitedKingdom market.  I accept your undertaking that effective steps will be takento secure these results.   2.  For  the  purpose of restricting foreign  supplies  of mutton and  lamb,the  arrivals, as compared with the corresponding  periods of the year ending the  30th June,  1932, as I understand the United Kingdom proposal, are tobe reduced  by at least  10  per cent,  for the  quarter ending the 31st March,1933, 15 per cent, for the  quarter ending the 30th June, 1933, 20  per  cent.for the  quarter ending the  30th September, 1933, 25 per cent,  for  the quarterending  the  31st December, 1933,  30 per  cent, for the quarter  ending the31st March, 1934, and  35  per cent,   for the quarter ending  the  30th  June,1934, and thereafter, unless otherwise agreed between the Governments  con-cerned, for  the remainder of the period of  the agreement concluded at Ottawaby not  less  than 35 per cent.   3.  During the  year  1933,  and in  the light of  the experience gained, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the  United  Kingdom will  consider,  in consultationwith His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand, the best means  of  ensuringan improved -price situation and  the  more orderly  marketing  of supplies.   4.  To assist in the  orderly marketing  of  supplies the Dominion will  givea  reliable estimate of shipments  of mutton and  lamb as early as possible ineach export  season.  This season  will  necessarily  cover  the  period the1st  October  in  one year to the  30th  September in  the following year.  Forthe  season  1932-33 we  estimate our  exports of frozen  mutton and  lamb at200,000 tons, with a 5 per cent, increase in each  of the following two  years.For the calendar year 1933  you  may take  it that our shipments  of  frozenmutton and  lamb will be the  same as those of the twelve months ended the30th June,  1932, i.e., of the  year which ended  with  the month immediately preceding the opening of the conference.   5.  It is understood that,  in  consideration  of  this &quot;undertaking on our part,no restriction  will  be  placed  by  His Majesty &apos;s  Government in  the UnitedKingdom upon  the importation of any  meat  from New Zealand during theperiod ending the 30th June,  1934.   6.  In  frozen beef,  we estimate  our exports  for the season  1932-33 atnot  more than 22,000 tons,  representing a maximum increase over the previousseason  of approximately  10 per cent.
and  that an effective policy of control  of  foreign  imports will  be adopted.This policy, as I understand it, will provide for some expansion of Home and dominion supplies of pig products.  New  Zealand is already an exporter of pork and bacon carcases and will be granted a reasonable share of the expansionmade possible by the reduction of foreign imports.   8.  All frozen beef (carcases and boned  beef) from foreign sources is to besubject to  the  same reductions as are specified in  paragraph 2.   9.  No increase of chilled beef imports from foreign sources into the  UnitedKingdom in excess of the twelve months  the 1st July, 1931, to the 80th June,1932, will  be permitted  during the  period  January  1933 to the 30th June,1934, and the rate of importation will not thereafter be increased during theperiod of the Ottawa  agreement except with  the concurrence of  the Govern-ments concerned.   10.  Should it appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  United Kingdomafter an enquiry that, at any time, in consequence of a restriction upon  foreignimports,  the supplies of meat of any  kind are  inadequate to meet the require-ments of consumers in the United Kingdom, then His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentmay remove any  such restriction until supplies  are again adequate.Yours sincerely.The  Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin,  M.P.,   United  Kingdom Delegation,      Imperial Economic Conference.(Signed)J. G. COATES.

Copy of Correspondence between Sir George Rainy and Sir Horace Wilson, in                        regard to Galvanised  Sheet.Sir,                                                   September 22, 1932.   When the Agreement between the British and Indian Delegations was madeat Ottawa it  was  found  necessary to postpone a final settlement of certain questions relating  to  iron and steel.  By Article  1  of the Agreement  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  undertook to  continue  afterthe 15th November free  entry to  all classes of Indian goods covered by theImport Duties Act.   It  was  clearly understood,  however, between the  twoDelegations  that the continuance of the free entry of Indian iron and steel fora longer period than six months from the date of the Agreement  was dependenton the settlement of satisfactory conditions in regard to the tariff treatment ofgalvanised sheet on importation into India.  At the same time an understandingwas reached that the conditions which would be satisfactory to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the  United Kingdom were as follows :    (1) On the  basis of present selling prices,  the duties on galvanised sheet         in  the Indian tariff to be  adjusted as follows : 1         30 rupees per ton on sheet made in the United Kingdom from Indian            sheet bar.         53 rupees per ton on sheet made in the  United  Kingdom from other            sheet  bar.  *         83 rupees per ton on sheet not made in the United Kingdom.   &apos;2) In the  event of further reductions  in the  price of sheet imported into         India and not made in the United Kingdom, the Government of India,         as  soon as they are  satisfied that a fall in prices had in fact occurred,         would, without  an  enquiry  by the Tariff Board, take  prompt  and         effective   action   to  meet  the situation  by  the  imposition  of an         additional duty.   The  amount  of  the  additional  duty  would  not         necessarily be limited to  the amount  of  the price reduction  actually         made, but would be sufficient to make  clear the intention of the         Government of India to maintain prices.   (3)  Each Government would remain at  liberty to take appropriate measures         to  prevent sales  at unfair prices by the  manufacturers in the other         country,  or  to check an  unnecessary  increase in prices against the         consumer by a combination  of manufacturers  in both  countries.   Oil seeds (other than essential).   Vegetable oils (other than essential).   Plumbago.   Sago  and tapioca  (but not sago  flour).   Vanilla beans.      And so  long  a3  it is  consistent with India&apos;s Tariff  Policy  to  impose   Customs duties on the  commodities in question    Fresh  fruits  (other than coconuts).   Dried, salted or preserved fruits.(b)  At a rate of 7J per  cent, ad valorem    Betelnuts.   Unground spices.      And, so  far  as preferences are granted to the United Kingdom, drugs   and medicines and apparel of all kinds.(e) Preferences at specific rates    Bitters  at the rate of 3-12 Rs. per  gallon.   Coffee at  the rate of  1  anna per lb.   Rum  at the rate  of  3-12  Rs. per proof gallon.   Tea at the rate of 2  annas per lb.   Unmanufactured  tobacco at rates to be subsequently determined.
Sir,                                                  September 22, 1932.   I have to thank you  for your letter of to-day&apos;s date on  the  subject of thetariff treatment to be  accorded  to galvanised sheets  imported into India, andto confirm that the terms of the understanding which has been reached in thisconnection by our respective Governments are accurately set out  in your letter.                                                     I am, &amp;c.                                             (Signed)    H. J. WILSON.Sir George Rainy, E.C.S.I., K.C.I.E.,   India House, Aldwych, W.C. 2.India (contd.)-   (4) These arrangements  to  remain  in  force until action  is  taken by  the         Government of India following  the next statutory Tariff  enquiry in         India into the Iron and Steel industry.   2.  The Indian Delegation are now prepared to undertake, on behalf of theGovernment of India, that proposals will be placed  before the Indian Legislaturefor the adjustment of the duties on galvanised sheet at the rates set forth in clause (1) above, and for obtaining the powers which are necessary to carry outthe intention of clauses  (2) and (3).  I have been  authorised by  my colleagues of the Indian Delegation to  make this communication to you, and I have now the honour  to request  that you  will  inform me whether the terms  of  theunderstanding have been correctly stated  in this letter.                                                  I am,  &amp;c.                                           (Signed)    GEORGE  RAINY.Sir Horace Wilson, K.C.B., C.B.E.,   Chief  Industrial Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s      Government in the United Kingdom.
