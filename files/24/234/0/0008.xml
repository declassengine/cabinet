Copy No.-                                                      9CP.  3B8 (32).CABINET.F E 5481/208/34]                    ANGLO-PERSIAN  RELATIONS.    AT the Cabinet of the 19th October I was asked to circulate an appreciation of the present position of our relations with Persia.  The following memorandumhas been prepared accordingly :     1.   Negotiations  have been in  progress with Persia for several years for theconclusion of a general treaty settlement to regularise Anglo-Persian relations.    2.   It  has always been contemplated that such a settlement would provide(a) for the continued use by the British navy of the Persian Island of Hen jam forpurposes of refuelling and recreation; and (b) for the renunciation by Persia ofthe antiquated claim which she had put forward to the islands of Bahrein, which constitutes an independjsntjrtieMidom, under  British^yoteotipn, off the Arabiancoast of the Persian Gulf.    3.   The Foreign  Office consider a general settlement with Persia,  if it canbe secured,  politically desirable (a) because, in its absence, our relations  with Persia are  likely to deteriorate, and there are, in any case, obvious objections toour being on bad  terms with any country with which we have so many points of contact;  (b) with a view to  avoiding friction with Persia in the strategicallyimportant area of the Persian Gulf where international friction might lead toembarrassing consequences; (c)  in order that Persia may not fall completelywithin the Russian orbit, with consequent danger to British interests in India.in Iraq and in the Middle East generally; and (d) in order that our importantvested  interests in Persia, and more particularly the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the satisfactory working of which is of great Imperial  importance may not be subjected to retaliatory action.  (With regard to (d). it may  be explained that.although it is to  the interest of the Persians themselves that  the Anglo-persian oil Company should be allowed to operate freely and prosperously, it is impossibleto rely on the Persians, in their present frame of mind, acting in their  own best interests.)    4.   A  further reason for  reaching  an  early  agreement with  Persia,  ifpossible,  is that, if Anglo-Persian  relations seriously deteriorate at this moment,it will probably be impossible to  secure  the  conclusion of the proposed Angio-Perso-Iraqi Convention for the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab.  A satisfactory settlement of this question is of great importance to British shipping, to british trade with  Iraq, and to the British military forces which wall be stationed in  Iraqunder the new Anglo-Iraqi Treaty  of Alliance of 1930.    5.   The two  outstanding difficulties in the way of the conclusion of a treatysettlement are Hen jam and Bahrein.    6.   As regards Hen jam,  the  Persians,  in  two notes of the 19th september and the 22nd September,  have formally demanded our evacuation of the island.If this demand  is  persisted in it  will be impossible  to  resist it, and it will benecessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to spend immediately some  40,000 onthe preparation of an alternative station at Bahrein, which is at present, in anycase, claimed by  Persia, though we do not admit the claim.   This  expendituremay, moreover, have to be greatly  increased if Bahrein is to be made suitable for       6576  [7757]
light cruisers!  The Service&apos;  Departments  agree  that, : if&apos;  Hen jam  is  to  be evacuated, an alternative must  be found in the Gulf, and that Bahrein is the only possible one.     7.  As regards  Bahrein,  there is reason  to  believe  that the  Shah  hascommitted himself personally to the prosecution  of this  claim frivolous thoughit  may  seem-and  that,  unless  some  &quot; face-saving&quot;  device  or  apparent&quot; compensation &quot; can be found, it will be impossible for  the Persian Governmentto abandon it.     8.  If sufficient  &quot; compensation &quot; could be offered to Persia,  it is possiblethat both our main desiderata, i.e., continued use of Hen jam  and the renunciation of the Persian claim to  Bahrein,  could be secured.  The concessions which  wehave hitherto offered to Persia do not appear to be sufficient to secure these objects.and, indeed,  it would be difficult to convince the Persian Government that their real value is even approximately as great as we have sought to  represent it.     9.  His Majesty&apos;s Minister at  Tehran has suggested that the Persian claimto Bahrein is now the main difficulty, and that, if this could be cleared out of theway. we might still secure what we need at Henjam and a general  settlement onthe lines we desire.   This view, incidentally, is shared by Sir Francis Humphrvs.who had opportunities of discussing matters with Teymourtache at Tehran lastspring and with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Geneva a few weeks ago, and who  is well qualified to form an opinion.     10.  Three  courses of action now appear to be possible :       (a) To threaten a rupture of  negotiations if  our minimum desiderata are           not conceded.     (6) To offer the Persians a still higher price for what we want.     (c) To dispose  of the Persian claim to Bahrein by some other means, in the           hope that a settlement of Henjam and the other questions outstanding           may  thus be facilitated.     11. (a)  It  may  well be argued, from  the  Persian Governments  unsatis-factory record during the negotiations, that their one object  is to extract by hardbargaining the last possible concession from His Majestys Government, and that.in order to reach a treaty settlement at all, it will be essential to inform thembluntly that this process must  come  to an end, that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave reached  the utmost limit  of concession, and that, if Persia is unwilling togive His Majesty&apos;s Government what they want in return for what they havealready offered,  there is no object  in negotiating further.  If there were good reason to  hope that this  course of action might bring the Persians to the pointof concluding the treaty, the Foreign Office would be strongly in favour of talcinga firm line with the Persian Government in this  sense without delay.  If the persians persist in their  demand  for our evacuation of Henjam, such  a  coursemay, indeed, be inevitable.   The Foreign  Office, however, feel that the PersianGovernment, unfortunately, attach  so little importance to the concessions hithertooffered to them by His Majesty&quot;s  Government that  a threat  to break  off  negotia-tions is unlikely to lead to the conclusion of a settlement, and that, if itTias to bemade,  it will probably have to  be carried out. in spite of the  dangers alluded toin paragraphs 3 and  4 above.     12.-(b)  The possibility of offering further concessions to Persia has alreadybeen considered.  Suggestions have been made for the offer to Persia of a triangleof desert country at the north-west corner pf British Baluchi st,?m   This  has beenvetoed by  ffTeT Govei^mnent  of  India.  The  Persians  have  asked for the ArabIslands of Tamb and Abu Musa (which they also claim), but these would haveto be purchased&quot; or leased, at a large price or rent, from their present &apos;Arab rulers,who would probably be unwilling  in any case to give them  up and could  not&quot; be forced to do so.   The supply to Persia on specially favourable terms of warshipsor  aircraft has proved  impracticable  for financial reasons  and owing  to the precedent it would create.  The waiver of the war and  post-war debt is no realconcession from the Persian Governments point of view, as  they  do not admitthis debt  and never intend to repay  it.   The Treasury have long abandoned  all hope of recovering  it.
     13.. (c) - Mr.: Hoare -considers that the  Bahrein and Hen jam questions are interconnected.   Sir Francis Hiunphryj^ agrees.   They  DoTntlnnk  that, ifthe Bahrein issue could be cleared out oi&quot;&quot;the way, rapidly and effectively i.e., if the Shah&apos;s face could be saved over this question a settlement might still be reached in  regard to Henjam, which would secure our continued use of this important point  and save the large expenditure  involved in developing an alternative. .,,     14.   The Foreign Office  have  long been anxious to  clear the Bahrein issue out of the way, and have repeatedly advocated that His Majesty&apos;s  Government should take the  initiative in pressing  for the reference of the Persian claim to  Bahrein to an international  court  for a  judicial settlement.  They consider that if this  is not  done, the Persians will still be able to force us  to accept arbitration on  this issue whether we  likeTTor not.  The Persians  are, indeed, already showing signs of pressing strongly  for arbitration, and in  the opinion of the Foreign Office are gaining the impression that His Majesty&apos;s  Government are afraid of  such a means of settlement.  If the view  hitherto held  is correct that the  Persian claim  is frivolous  and hopelessly weak,  the Foreign Office consider that we have nothing to  fear  from a  judicial settlement and that we should indeed  strengthen our  position  by taking the initiative in pressing for it. They consider, however,  that  it would be well in the first instance to obtain the opinion of the  Law Officers of the  Crown on the strength of our case.  It  has, indeed, already been suggested to  the  India Office that it would  be  well for them  to obtain an authoritative legal  opinion on this.  If it is  decided to referthis question  to  a  judicial  settlement,  the Foreign Office  suggest  that  theopportunity might well  be taken to refer to a judicial  settlement at the same time the  equally frivolous Persian pretensions  to  Tamb and Abu  Musa, thus disposing once and for all of these tiresome and potentially dangerous claims. It would  probably also  be well to  press for a  judicial  decision regarding the-ownership of the  island of Sirri,  which was forcibly  occupied  by Persia some forty-five  years ago.                                Conclusions.    15.   The Foreign Office views  may be summarised  as follows :      (a) It is still desirable, on general grounds  of policy, to endeavour to secure a satisfactory treaty settlement with Persia, if this is at all possible.    (b) The chief difficulty in the way of such a settlement is that the  two main points for solution are (1) the abandonment by  Persia of her claim  to  Bahrein, and (2) the grant by the Persian Government to His Majesty&apos;s Government of facilities  for His Majesty&apos;s ships at Henjam. Both these are rightly or wrongly regarded  by the Persians as concessions on their side.  The concessions hitherto offered by His Majesty&apos;s Government  in exchange are considered insufficient by the Persians, and their value is in fact to some extent illusoi-y.    (c) It seems, therefore, impossible to obtain a solution of both Bahrein  and Henjam which would be entirely satisfactory to us, unless  we are prepared to offer Persia fresh concessions of substantial value.  Such  further  concessions would  be  difficult to find, especially as the payment of any considerable  financial quid pro  quo would, in  present  circumstances,  be difficult  to justify  to  public opinion in this country.    (d) Although, however, the negotiations are unlikely to yield a  satisfactory solution  of both  Bahrein and  Henjam, neither  of  these questions will be satisfactorily solved if the negotiations come to an end.  Unless some special arrangement is reached  with the Persian Government, His Majesty&apos;s  Govern- menfc will  probably be forced  both to evacuate Henjam and to arbitrate Bahrein.    (e) It is now  necessary  to  face  the fact  that some kind  of  arbitration regarding Bahrein may  be inevitable.   It should, however,  be possible for  His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist that such arbitration should take the form of a judicial decision  by  the  Permanent Court of International Justice on  the legal issues  involved, and it might well be  easier for the Shah to yield to  an inter- national tribunaPs finding than  to a  refusal of  His Majesty&apos;s Government to admit  his claim.   It would seem wise to obtain a preliminary opinion from the Law Officers on these legal issues without delay, in order  that His Majesty&apos;s Government may have all  possible information  regarding the strength  of their case.                                                                      !
    (/)  If the case proves to be as strong as has been hitherto believed, then HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  should, in the opinion of the Foreign  Office,  take full advantage of  the  fact, and should be prepared  to  agree  to a  reference to thePermanent Court.    (g)  Mr. Hoare should be  authorised to endeavour to obtain a satisfactory solution of the Hen jam issue in return for an agreement to refer the Bahrein issue to the Permanent Court.
