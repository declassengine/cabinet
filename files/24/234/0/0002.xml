THIS POCOMtSaT IS T.E PROPERTY 01&apos;&apos; 1113 BRITANHIC nAJE3TY*3                       GOVERMlaiiT .  I^aaORAiJDUM BY TilE SECRETARY OffSTATE ffOR THE CQL03IES     I have already warned the Cabinet that a difficult situation has arisen over the teaching of Italian in ...aita0I have to answer a question on this subject on Wednesday,, andI therefore asH the Cabinet to approve &amp;s a matter of urgencythe course which I propose to tolcee     I have of course been in touch with the Foreign Officethroughout- in my correspondence with the Governor,, and theSecretary af State for foreign Affairs concurs in thismemorandum o     The position has arisen in the following way.   AS theCabinet are aware, we decided,, and the Letters Patent(afterwards confirmed by act of Parliament) laid down  that infuture English and Maltese should be the only languages to betaught in the elementary schools in Maltac   After theelection, which, as we expected, resulted in the return ofthe Nationalist Party,, Ministers set to work to see how theycould get round the law on the language question,   TheMinister of Education is Dr. Mizsi, whose activities are wellknown to ray colleagues., and who is unfortunately the movingspirit in the government today0   .urc Miasi has issuedinstructions to the teachers in Malta that so-called&quot;voluntary15 clasr.es are to be introduced in all elementary schools for teaching Italian to children of all ages.   Hehas called upon all teachers    cooperate in this movement..                                                       an d
                           O o,nd  has  circularised parents  to  the  effect  that  any  oarent who  does not  abject  will be presumed to  wish his children to undergo  this  voluntary  instruction,,    There is no doubt that the  teachers  are  to  be  paid for  this out of public funds; and an intimation has been  given  to  the  teachers that their future prospects  will be influenced  by the  success of the &quot;voluntary&quot; classeBo    When Maltese  Ministers announced this departure,, the Governor informed them that  it was clearly contrary to the spirit  of  the lav/ whatever  the strict legal interpretation might be0   The Governor0a local  legal adviser had advised that  on the whole he thought the proposal was not contrary to the letter  of  the law,, .   I ams  however,, advised &quot;by the Law Officers that the action  of Ministers is not only clearly  contrary  to the spirit of the law but is also in fact a breach of the Letters Patent,,     I think  it i3 clear th:;.t we must make  it plain to ministers that their action cannet be tslerated9 and that theymust  conform to  what the Law Officers advise me is the law; and I propose to  instruct the Governor accordingly,, and to giro an  answer in the House in this  sense.     iVe  shall probably  have to face  the  situation in which ministers refuse  to comply with  the  law.    In that case 1 thinS: the only effective course  would be  to tell them that if they do  not carry out the law the control of education willbe taken  out  of their handsg and education  will be made a reserved service  until  such time as  they are willing to complywith the  lawo   I have  no doubt  that this is the right courseo   It may  involve legal difficulties0     The Law Officers advise that I  can  only make aducation a reserved service if I oro satisfied that the course proposed is necessitated &quot;by a wfir-aye,,, emergency&quot; within the meaning of the Letters Patent.   &quot;grave emergency&quot; is defined as &quot;a grave                                                  emergency
emergency endangering the interests of British subjectsresident in Malta.D or endangering peace, order and good government&quot;.   I am satisfied that the refusal of ministers to.carry out the education law would constitute a grave emer-gensy&quot; and I should propose to proceed accordingly, if ministers prove obdurate   My action would probably be challenged in the Malta Courts; and there is no knowingwliat decision that Court might give0   If the decision wasunfavourable., it would &quot;be necessary to regularise thepositisxi &quot;by a short Bill in Parliament hea?eo   &quot;..&quot; have,however, no doubt that we must unhesitatingly accept the challenge which Ministers have thrown down on a question inwhich Parliament here was unanimous,, and which is of theutmost importanceo     I understand from the foreign Secretary that it wouldbe desirable, having regard to the international situation,if possible to postpone action for a short time a   Ipropose therefore to try to get the question postponed,and to communicate to the Governor the decision of theCabinet but to tell him to take no action thereon until he receives further instructions *Downing Street,     24th October, 1932,
