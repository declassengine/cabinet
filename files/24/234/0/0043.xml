9h 1document is the  property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.CH3T.p. 394(32)C A B I N E THAT IOMALIT Y OF MARRIED WOMEN.Memorandum by the Hone Secretary.Copy No. . ,          I desire to obtain the decision of the Cabinet onthe question whether a Bill to deal with the nationality ofwomen should form part of the legislative programme for thenext Session.   A Bill on this subject is at present includedin the classified list of Bills which was considered by theHome Affairs Committee on the 4th October last  (H.A.C. 9thConclusions (32)) and by the Cabinet on the .12th October(Cabinet 52 (32) Conclusion 6).          The British nationality law throughout the Common-wealth, subject to certain minor exceptions, is ba,sed uponthe general principle that the national status  of the husbandgoverns that of the wife.   The Women&apos;s Organisations have for several years been pressing that this principle shouldbe -abandoned, so as to produce the result that  a. woman1 snationality should be determined by her own choice and, inparticular, that a British-born woman should not lose british nationality on marriage to a foreigner except with her ownconsent.          At an International Conference held at the Hague in1930, a Nationality Convention was concluded in which a, numberof Governments agreed to alter their national laws so as toremove certain difficulties arising from the present conflict of laws.          Articles 8 - 10 of the Hague Convention areconcerned with the nationality of married women.          Article 8 removes the difficulty of statelessnessby providing that the loss of a woman&apos;s nationality shall be
                                                           CJ O .o                                                             y Uconditional upon her acquiring the nationality of her husband.          Article 9 applies the same principle to the case where a wife loses her nationality during iaarriage by virtueof a change in her husband&apos;s nationality, and provid.es thatin such a case the wife is not to lose her nationality unlessshe acquires her husband.&apos;s new nationality under the law ofthe country where he is naturalised.          Article 10 provides further that even where the wife would obtain her husband&apos;s nationality on his naturalisation-tion she shall not do so except with her own consent.          The Women&apos;s Organisations too]-; exception to theArticles of this Convention on the ground that they stereotypedthe existing inequality of the sexes in the matter of nation&quot;ality, but at the last meeting of the Assembly of the Leagueof Nations held in September last, the replies to a recentquestionnaire received from about twenty Governments (includingGermany, Belgium, He t her lands, America, Hungary, Norway and sweden, Switzerland. and Denmark) showed that the majority of states replying were agreed, that the Hague Articlesrepresented, an advance In the direction desired by the women,and represented the maximum degree of agreement that was atpresent possible.   3?or this reason it was tliought that nofurther international conference or discussion was at presentadvisable and., if held, would, only emphasise existingdifferences.          In accordance with his instructions the UnitedKingdom delegate stated that &quot;it was the urgent desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to see the Convention generally adopted.In their view it represented, the greatest common measure ofinternational agreement and should be accepted as tho best solution at the present time in the interests of all concerned&quot;          A resolution was passed and adopted by the assembly in which the hope was expressed that the States which had-
already signed the Hague Nationality Convention would introduce such legislation as night he necessary to give effect to it andwould deposit their ratifications at an early date.          It is now for the Cabinet to decide whether thenecessary legislation should be passed for the purpose of putting His Kajesty&apos;s Government in a position to ratify theHague Convention.   It is important to bear in mind in thisconnection that Canada has already passed such legislation andthat it was put on record at the Imperial Conference, 1930,that it was assumed that all members of the Commonwealth whowere represented at the Hague Conference would introduce such-legislation.   Failure on the part of the United Kingdom to legislate for this purpose in the near future would be inconsistent with the views expressed by the United kingdom delegate at the recent Assembly.   Moreover, having regard tothe policy put on record at the Imperial Conference of 1930 andto the action already taken by Canada, this legislation is urgently necessary to preserve the maintenance of uniformity inthe code of nationality law throughout the British CommonwealthLegislation by the United Kingdom Parliament would no doubtencourage the Dominion Governments to introduce correspondinglegislation.          From, the parliamentary point of view there areundoubted advantages in an immediate decision.   During the nexSession it is certain that Private Bills will be introduced on this subject, going; much further than is proposed in thismemorandum, and the Government would be in a better positionto resist such Bills, if Government legislation had alreadybeen introduced to deal with the question.          If the Cabinet decide that a Bill to give effect tothe Hague Convention should form part of the legislative programme for next Session, the opportunity will be taken toinclude in the Bill a number of detailed amendments of the
                                                             9 fi Q                                                             bj\J 0                           -4-  existing law,  some of which have already been approved at  former Imperial Conferencesj while others are at present under  consic.era.tion in consultation with the Dominion Governments.            Ily predecessor had. submitted to the Cabinet a  proposa.1 to relieve British born women who become aliens on  marriage from the disabilities attaching to aliens, and the  Cabinet decided that this proposal should be examined in  consultation with the Law Officers.   That examination was duly  carried out, but my predecessor resigned before he had an  opportunity of reporting to the Cabinet the result of his  investigations.   On examining this proposal, I have come to  the conclusion that there are very strong; objections in  principle, both of a constitutional and. legal character, to  any proposal to create a. special class of privileged, persons  who,  while remaining aliens- in the eyes of the law, would  enjoy the rights and privileges of a British subject,  including the exercise of the franchise and eligibility for  membership of the House of Commons.   I do not therefore  propose that the Bill should contain any provisions of this  character.            Having regard, to all the circumstances, I think that  it would be most expedient to introdu.ee early next Session a.  Bill to enable the Hague Convention to be ratified, and. I  should, be glad, to obtain the approval of the Cabinet to the  preparation of a Bill on these lines, including the other  amendments to which I have referred..                                  J .
