MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR  WAR.    I append an appreciation by the Chief of the Imperial General  Staff which was in process of preparation for the Prime Minister and the  Lord  President of the Council.In view of next Monday&apos;s Cabinet, it has been printed at once for my colleagues at my request.                                                                         H.  The War Office,         28th  October, 1932.MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.     In view o  the serious crisis at present confronting the world,  I  have, at therequest of the Prime Minister, drawn up a paper reviewing the military situation as itis at the present time and as  it may develop in  the not very distant future.  Thefrontier between politics and strategy is at times difficult to demarcate, and in orderto present  the  picture as a whole I  have found  it necessary to make a number ofincursions into what might strictly be considered political territory.     I propose in the succeeding chapters to review :                   (i) The present military situation in Europe.                 (ii) The situation  in the Far East.                 (iii) German military  aims in the future.                 (iv)  Disarmament.             and (v)  To add some  suggestions.CHAPTER I.                   The present military situation in  Europe.     Ever -since the Armistice, Europe has igradually been  splitting into two&quot; -maincamps.   At the time of the Peace Conference, France  with  an eye to her own securitypressed for a Rhine frontier.   As an alternative to this she was promised and  accepted a pact of guarantee by the United States and ourselves.  When this pact fell  throughowing to the withdrawal of the United States, France  in her pursuit  of secui-b-y.againstGermany in  the future  turned in desperation to the  creation of  a  series of  militaryalliances in Europe.   She has concluded  military agreements with  Belgium, Czecho-&quot;Slovakia, Yugo-Slavia, Roumania and Roland.  The armies of these States are trainedon French  lines and  in some cases by  French Military  Missions.  Each  of  tbemiholds territory which its former owners .may seek to recover by force so soon as they-have the military power.  One common bond unites France and all  her  allies against&apos;their respective enemies, and that bond is a determination to keep the defeated States,both-as regards, armaments and frontiers, in the fetters of the Peace Treaties  as long:as^possible.   Their statesmen are well aware that, however  modest.may be the initialirelaxation of these ^treaties, it  will be like the .first breach in a tdam which, a-apidly1 widening, sweeps  away-the ^defences - and allows the  flood waters to  break through.The granting of equality of rights will almost inevitably lead to rearmament with theobject of ireadjusting^by force some Of the ifrontiers.
     For France, in particular, the maintenance of the status quo is a matter of life anddeath.   She managed almost by a miracle, as it must seem to her,  and by the powerfulhelp of her allies, to defeat her  hereditary foe  in a most exhausting  war and  at anappalling price.  She realizes that, however great her military efforts in the future, thefacts of population and industrial efficiency on the German side will ultimately  weighdown the  scales  against  her if  and when Germany is allowed to regain her complete freedom.     The other camp consists of the  ex-enemy  States and Italy.   Italy has gravitatedtowards  this bloc, her action being dictated  more by a common hatred  of France, th whose policies she is completely opposed, than by any natural  community of interestswith the other members.   Her direct interest in the disturbance of the status  quo  isconcerned  mainly  with  the  desire  to  obtain additional  colonial  territory.   Forgeographical, economic  and historical reasons she desires our  friendship and cannot afford to be opposed to us in war, as 1914 proved.  Whatever may have  been  thought of&quot; Signor Mussolini&apos;s earlier professions, it is probable that he now desires peace.   Ourgreat influence with Italy might affect  profoundly  the future course of events andthere is the possibility of  detaching her  from Germany, should the latter show signsof developing a policy of  militarism, rearmament and revenge.     The ex-enemy States are actuated by  complete  unity  of purpose, namely, theright to rearmament and the readjustment of frontiers.  Italy accords Germany firmdiplomatic  support and has taken  the smaller defeated States  under  her wing.   her relations with Hungary are particularly cordial.     For convenience I  set out below the mobilized strength  of  the more importantarmies on  the Continent of  Europe, calculated  in  terms of  infantry divisions, within  months after the outbreak of war.   These figures, which do  not  include cavalry divisions or deal with the amount of heavy armament, are only a rough indication ofthe  probable size  of  the various  armies,  which  are of  very  varying  militaryefficiency :                    France    ...     ...     ...     ...    ...     49BelgiumCzecho- SlovakiaYugo-SlaviaRoumania  ...PolandGermanyItalyU.S.S.R.   ... 12 17 27 30 48 14 60*100         * These are believed to be the official figures but they are probably excessive.                               A.  Western  Europe.    I will now review the military situation as it is at present in connection with thesetwo groups of Powers.    The French  Army is the most formidable military machine in the  world to-day.The  Higher  Command is excellent, the morale  and  fighting qualities  exceptionallygood, the reserves of material and preparations for industrial mobilization are probablyadequate, and the trained reserves total  about  5,000,000 men.  A most  powerful andmodern system of fortifications, which will  be  completed in 1934, is being constructedalong the Eastern frontier at a cost of  30,000,000.     The armies  of the allies of France are of varying military quality and in somecases without sufficient reserves  of material for a long war.  Assuming,  however, thatthe military agreements are  faithfully kept, the allies of France would be able to placein the field  134 divisions  in  a  war with  Germany, Italy and   Hungary.   These,with the French  Army, produce a grand  total  of about  183 divisions within thefirst  3 months of  a war.  It is  not suggested  that the whole  of these forces areavailable for the invasion of Germany.  A large proportion of the Polish Army willbe engaged in watching Russia, while the whole of the Roumanian Army will bewatching Russia on one flank and Hungary on the other.   Czecho-Slovakia, apart fromdetaching a number of divisions to  deal with Hungary, would be  able  to co-operate with the remainder in the French plan.  The Belgian Army would be free to co-operate with the French.  France, if at war with Germany, would be embarrassed  by the italian attitude.   The  Italian Army would  nominally  mobilize  60 divisions  in the  first3 months, but it is doubtful  whether the majority of the 30 reserve divisions contem-plated would be  efficient  or fully equipped by that  time.  The Italian Army would,
however, be largely neutralized by Yugo-Slavia and France would be content to standon the defensive on her naturally strong Italian frontier, detaching perhaps 10 divisions for the purpose.   She might also have  to  send 3 colonial divisions from France to north Africa.  It is impossible to make a precise calculation of the number of divisions which  France would have at her disposal to  deal with  Germany, as everything would depend upon the attitude of Italy, Russia and Hungary.  France, in any case, shouldhave no difficulty in defeating Germany.     Germany has a small army of 100,000 well-trained  men, a military police  force ofwhich  perhaps 60,000  would be available for military operations, and a large reserve ofpartially trained  man-power in her patriotic associations and in her men with war experience.  Effectives would be ample, but serious difficulties would be encountered intheir mobilization and  in providing the necessary material.  I estimate that the  numberof divisions which she  could put into the field in the early stages of war would be  14,and these would of course be quite inadequate to meet the French Army supported byportions of the Polfsh and Czecho-Slovakian Armies.   The  weak  point in the french army  is the slowness  of its mobilization.  The French have always  stimulated their people to believe  that  Germany can launch an attack with her long service Army and police, backed by the elite of the Associations, almost simultaneously with a declarationof war.  I am convinced that there is no real basis for  such a fear.   Germany  couldnot afford to commit the  whole of her small army West of the  Rhine, nor could  shedenude the country of the  whole of her police.   Equally it will  be impossible to conceal preparations for  such a  coup.   Should, however, the worst  French fears berealized and  a highly trained and  mobile  force of,  say, 150,0U0 Germans beat  theFrench in a race for the Rhine bridgeheads in the first few days and enter the  frontierprovinces, the French  mobilization scheme might be thrown  into some confusion.   Thesituation,  particularly  if, as the French  allege, air bombing attacks  by German civilmachines were possible against the railway concentration centres, might be temporarilyserious, but nothing could prevent the  destruction  of the German  forces so madlylaunched in an offensive, and the ultimate defeat of Germany.     France has  obtained  guarantees from  Great  Britain  to  give  her  assistanceimmediately under the Locarno  Treaty if she  is  the victim of  aggression.  Italy isalso a guarantor under this treaty, but it is  unlikely that  France is optimistic as 1Ohelp from that quarter.  Our guarantee has  considerable moral value, but on  land atany rate its material effect is small, so long  as our mobilization is as at present.   Wecould in fact give no help whatever to France during the  early and  critical period ofsuch a war.     France does not seek war or  desire  any military adventure.   She wishes  only tokeep   what she has   in  peace.   She greatly  fears  German intentions towards her,particularly since the new German Government has come  into power.  French anxietiesare mainly for the future  when the Peace Treaties will have been relaxed and the facts of population, economic resources and industrial efficiency will  be against her.   So faras the  present is concerned, with her formidable military preparations, her network ofalliances and the military  impotence of Germany, neither France nor her satellites have in fact anything to fear from Germany or from a German-Italian coalition.    In Italy the Fascist regime, the encouragement of sport and the intensive militarytraining of youths has succeeded in breathing into the Italian a virility and a militaryardour  which he has  in the past conspicuously  lacked.  There is no doubt that the morale of the nation has greatly  improved and  they would fight bravely in the early stages  of a war at any rate.   The army can nominally mobilize 60 divisions, as I havealready said, in the early stages.   The Italian military problem is  a difficult  one.  Sheis faced with a virile and warlike enemy in the East with whom her relations are by nomeans  good.  If the only problem  were a straight fight with Yugo-Slavia her numbers,her reserves of material and industrial resources should be sufficient to give her  victory,but France would never allow Yugo-Slavia to be overrun and a war between the latterand  Italy could  not leave  France indifferent.   Italy  could  not  possibly  wage a victorious  war on both fronts.   For similar reasons, though  an Italian attack  uponFrance might gain temporary successes in  the  provinces of Nice  and  Savoy,  the intervention of the Yugo-Slav army in the rear, coupled with an eventual Frenchoffensive along the historic lines of invasion of Northern Italy must bring Italy to  herknees.   If Italy were found fighting in a coalition with Germany  and Hungary against france and the Little  Entente,  such forces  as  she could send against France wouldprobably be brought to a  standstill in the Alps, while her main forces were engaged inan indecisive struggle  with Yugo-Slavia in  the  East.   It is almost  certain that  she would  be unable to detach troops to give any direct aid to Germany.    (C666)                                                                   A 3
                              B.   Eastern Europe:     Though there is no State in Europe so secure from invasion, the Soviet Governmentnever ceases to preach  to its  people the  imminent danger of attack by the capitalistStates.  Much of this attitude: may be due to a desire to  exact the necessary sacrificesfrom their, people to meet this so-called danger -t but the phenomenon, remains and,however ill-founded, there is in this belief an  undoubted substratum of sincerity.Russia, however, is at present in no mood for military adventure.  She  is mainly concerned with the. crisis of the Five Year Plan, upon the success of which Stalin andthe Bolshevik leaders  have staked everything.   Internal difficulties, are multiplying,famine and misery  are  on  the increase and may reach  a point which even the longsuffering Russian will not tolerate.     Russia  has unlimited reserves in trained man power and her peace strength is thegreatest in Europe.   The morale  of the Red Army is said to be improving.   The troops are well fed and clothed and appear  to be  loyal to their leaders, but are liable to beaffected by the attitude of the peasantry from which class the recruits are chiefly drawn.They may be  expected  to  give a good account of themselves if fighting on  Russiansoil.  On the other  hand the ability to equip and arm their tnan-power is, and will befor some years, limited.  Military industry today is in its infancy though the completionof the Five Year  Plan, which has  a definitely military aspect, should show a considerable improvement in this respect.   The army is not yet well equipped with modern technicalweapons although it may be noted that in the last 12 months Russia appears to have produced some 750 tanks.   Transport services are over strained and badly disorganized.Railways to the western frontier are  few and good roads are even scarcer.  Russia canmobilize 100  divisions in  the early stages  of a  war, but only a proportion of these would be available to fight in Western Europe.   There are 27 infantry and 7 cavalry divisions in the frontier districts facing  Poland  and Roumania, and these could be supported immediately  by some 16 of the remaining divisions in the western  portions of Russia.   Poland  has an army of 48 divisions of good quality and their General staff are confident  of  their  ability  to withstand an attack  by the  Red Army.   She has amilitary agreement with Roumania for combined action against Russia.   The RoumanianArmy with 30 divisions  is inefficient, ill  led and  badly  equipped.  Both of thesecountries have a military agreement  with France, and it may be assumed that, whileFrench conscripts could hardly be induced to fight in Eastern  Europe, some military assistance and ample  supplies of war material would  be  forthcoming   It  seems probable that  the Red  Army, though it might overrun  Bessarabia  and advance intoPoland, would ultimately be ejected from Polish and Roumanian territory,, apart fromBessarabia, provided that  these two  countries  act together and are helped  by France.Poland would probably be content  with such a conclusion  and would not seek any military adventure far beyond  her frontiers.     The intervention of Germany in  a Soviet-Polish war appears at  the present timeto be unlikely as  this would leave Germany completely at the  mercy of France, whowould not hesitate to take advantage  of such a situation.  In such a case  my view isthat Russia would be definitely held  by Poland and that the combined forces of Franceand her allies  would dispose of Germany.  A war between  Poland  and Germany inwhich Russia does not  take a  hand  must end in  the  loss of East  Prussia  and themilitary defeat of Germany.  The number of divisions that Germany could  concentrateupon the Oder would not be sufficient to prevent the Poles reaching Berlin.     To sum up. the situation in the  East at the present  time, Poland backed by her military alliances is fairly  secure against either  Russia  or Germany separately, or asa coalition.     The U.S.S.R. shows signs of taking her stand beside Germany in her agitation forequality of rights and  has  lent diplomatic  support to the German-Italian bloc.   Thepossibilitj7  of Russia aligning herself with Germany in a future,  struggle must beconsidered.   There is reason to believe  that plans for military co-operation have beendiscussed, by  the Russian  and  German  General  Staffs,. but  their exact nature  isunknown.   Such an alliance would  be of capital  importance to Germany if engaged ina struggle for the Polish Corridor and would also give Russia an opportunity to regainthe- territory filched from her by the  Treaty  of Riga in 1921.  It must not. be forgotten that Russia is our one declared enemy, and that while she is  preparing primarily for awar on her western frontiers she  will not hesitate to strike at us  through Afghanistanshould the situation be favourable.   Such a move, would produce a  most dangerous situation in India,; to. which the ILS.S.R. is  fully alive.   For these reasons it cannot beto our interest that Russia should be  strong, and anything that can legitimately bedone, to weaken her will be to our advantage.
CHAPTER II.                        THE  SITUATION  IN THE FAK EAST.     In the Far East there appear to be three factors, which in. a large measure are the primary cause of the present  state of affairs and which, will continue to influence the future trend of events with its consequent effect upon Europe.     The first is the internal state of China.   For, the past twenty years this  has been chaotic,  and more recently it  has been  aggravated by her  Governments  policy of disregard for foreign rights and privileges.   In Manchuria in particular,, where  Japan for the past thirty years has claimed  special  interests  (interests which from time to time have been recognized by  the Great Powers), the spread  of Chinese nationalism has afforded the Japanese an opportunity for action.     This  leads to  the second  factor the  internal  situation in Japan.    Growing economic distress  and widespread discoutent seem largely to have induced the Japanese Army to seek a  remedy  in  the forcible occupation of Manchuria.   There  is  little doubt that  they  acted sincerely,  believing  that  their  policy  would  result  in an improvement in  Japan&apos;s economic  position, but their  methods  have transgressed the ways of  modern civilization and have antagonized the opinion  of the world in general. The Japanese Army, moreover, has virtually usurped the powers  of government, not only in Manchuria but also, in its own country, and the chauvinism of its leaders has blinded them to the consequences of their improvident action.   Sooner or later they will no doubt repent and return to a more reasonable frame of mind, and of  this there are already some: signs..  An  opportunity should then occur for  the Great  Powers and Great  Britain  in particular to  influence Japan  against a  repetition  of  similar methods, and so lead towards.the return of more stable  conditions in the whole of the Far East.  To thwart Japan in her present mood, which should be regarded only as. a passing phase, might well  result in forcing her deeper iuto, the  mire and  might even lead to the complete collapse of  authoritative government in  that country.     The third factor is again the insidious activity of  Soviet Russia.   Beut on causing the collapse of the &quot; Imperialist. Powers,&quot; with India as a major  objective in her plans, anxious  in  regard to the future of her  interests in  the Far East now that  Japanese control has spread to North Manchuria, yet impotent  to resist, and ever assiduous in her endeavours further to. bolsbevize China, where large areas in  Mongolia and Kiangsi are already under  a Soviet rule, Russia watches intently and schemes how best to profit from the present Sino-Japanese dispute.     At times, since  September  1931, relations between  the  U.S.S.R. and Japan have definitely, been  strained, though recently at any rate some  understanding appears to have been arrived  at between  the two countries.  This is no doubt because  neither desires nor  is in a  position to  embark upon a  major war,  which for  several reasons would most probably be of long duration and possibly even then  prove indecisive.     The extension  of Japanese control in  Manchuria must inevitably result in  a diminution of Russian influence in that country and in the Far East  generally.  As the contrary is equally true there can be no doubt which is preferable to the British Empire.   Though we do not wish and in  fact are morally unable to condone Japan&apos;s disregard of her  obligations  under the Covenant,  the Nine  Power Treaty and the Kellogg  Pact, and cannot even justify the methods she  has  thought fit to employ, it must remain beyond dispute that the extension of  Japanese control  in  Manchuria would  be less  inimical to the  British  Empire than  the inevitable alternative anincrease of Soviet influence.     To  maintain  our position  in  the world  and our possessions in the Far East a friendly Japan, is, an essential requisite, and it seems to me that our  interests lie in thedirection of attempting to regain the confidence of that country as a prelude to a return of British influence  in  Japanese policy.   A friendly  Japan is the  best  antidote to a hostile Russia, and,  since  by treaty Japan  is entitled to maintain a limited number oftroops  in Manchuria, it should not be  impossible to arrive, at  a  solution which wouldbe compatible with the sovereign rights of China and at the  same time  embody theprinciple of an effective autonomous government in Manchuria, assisted by japanese and other foreign advisers.  By this means it should  he possible to. safeguard, in some measure  at any  rate, the all-important principle of the, &quot; open door &quot; in Manchuria.
                    GERMAN MILITARY AIMS IN THE FUTURE.    Every German  Government  of whatever political  complexion has for years past been working upon a definite programme *with a view to the ultimate destruction of theTreaty of Versailles.   Their first move was the abolition of military control:  this was followed by  securing  the evacuation  of the  Rhineland  before the date  fixed by theTreaty.  Immediately this was conceded agitation was commenced for the reduction of reparations, which produced the Hague Agreements.   Aided  by economic collapse thenext move was the complete abolition of reparations.   This was achieved at Lausannein July of  this year.   &quot; Equality of rights &quot; is  the  next item on the programme, andwhen that has been gained we may expect a demand for the recession of the PolishCorridor, Dantzig and Upper Silesia.   The stage will then be set for another act in thedrama of the scrapping of the Peace Treaty,  namely,  the  restoration of Germany&apos;scolonies.  The demand for the cancellation of the clause regarding war guilt is a note which is played upon from time to time in the intervals between the granting of onedemand and the approach to the next.     Parallel with the political advance the  Reichswehrministerium, since  the  removalof the Inter-Allied Mission of Control, has lost no opportunity of evading the treaty provisions both in the letter and spirit  and of preparing the Reichsheer for its  ultimatereorganization.  The Great General Staff has almost openly been  reconstituted, and athinly disguised system of  Staff College training is in active operation.  Staffs are of excessive size.   The establishment of automatic weapons in the cavalry and  infantryhas been increased.  In the artillery,  the numbers of guns  and howitzers have been increased and anti-aircraft guns have been added.  Considerable progress has been madein mechanizing all arms of the service.   Motor machine gun  sections, and  possibly alsoarmoured car and tank units, have been formed or trained under cover of the divisionalmechanized transport columns.  The technical equipment of all units has been brought up to a high standard.  Tests with experimental tanks are reported and the training ofofficers in air duties is confirmed.   In field training forbidden weapons,  such as anti-tank guns, armoured cars and tanks are represented in dummy form, and the influence of air forces is taken into account.  Experimental units, e.g., reconnaissance detachments,smoke sections, cyclist battalions and motor cyclist machine gun battalions are formed.     Excessive appropriations for repairs  and renewals  of  material and under othersub-heads have been a constant feature of the German military budget, which rose from l8,5(i3,000  in 1924-25 to  24,327,000 in 1928-29, and the reduction of the budget in 1931-32 to  23,138,000 was accompanied by  no economy  under the above subheads,which reflect  in no way the recent fall in the price level of raw materials and of labour costs.     I am convinced that the  large surplus funds thus  obtained have been applied toillegal purposes, of which the accumulation of reserves of war material for the mobiliz-ation and expansion  of the Reichsheer  would take a first  place.     On the industrial  front, 1 have reason  to believe that large funds have been appliedto research and to the preparation of industrial mobilization.  This has  been  fullystudied and organized, and there is no  doubt that factory  conversion plans with thenecessary process-specifications and stocks of jigs, gauges and machinery exist, thoughmuch doubtless remains to be done.     What is the immediate purpose of  these preparations ?  From what direction, itmay be asked, is Germany threatened ?  She  holds  nothing that  other nations covet.She is by her own admission poor.  She can  afford to wait before embarking on largemilitary policies.     I suggest that the answer is to be found, not on her western frontier where she isat present resigned to  the  inevitable, but in the  East, for if there is one point on whichall Germany  stands passionately united it is  in  the  determination  to recover the territories torn from her in the east, to re-unite  East Prussia with the Reich and to rescue  her kinsmen in  the Polish Corridor and  in  Upper Silesia.   Poland standsequally determined never to relinquish those areas into which she has poured so muchcapital,  and  where  there  is  now a large Polish majority.  To  both  nations it is evident that the solution of the problem can be determined only by force.  It is in thelight of  the above considerations that  we must  view the  German  proposals and  theirrelation to recent developments in the military training of German youth, if we would see them in their true  perspective.  It is possible to exaggerate their immediate effect,but their ultimate significance cannot be in doubt.
     The details of the German  proposals are not yet determined as definitely as couldbe desired.  In  brief, they involve  replacement of Part V of the Treaty of Versaillesby a First Disarmament Convention concluded  for a fixed  period  under and duringwhich  Germany, while receiving recognition of Equality of Status, would agree tocertain limitations As an  &quot;idea&quot;* or &quot; illustration &quot;f of what is contemplated.     (a)  Germany will accept prohibition of any weapon prohibited for all states.     (b)  But she claims the right to shape  her  defence  system according to her needs            and to make certain changes, for example                  (i) Reduction  of the period of service in the Reichsheer from 12 to            &quot; perhaps &quot;I 6 years.                (ii)  Systematic arrangement of the defence force ; a term which must            be  understood  to cover the  formation of, at least, training units of the air            force,  tanks and armoured cars, anti-aircraft defence, and of such other            arms and services as may now be forbidden  but which would be permitted            to all states  by the  Convention.  A cavalry division  may be disbanded to            provide the necessary personnel.                (iii)  A compulsory service militia training 40,000 conscripts each year            for 3 months without repetition courses.     These changes ai-e not, we  are told, to involve an increase of more than 2,000 menin the authorized establishment  of the Reichsheer fixed by treaty at 100,500,  and  will result in no increase in the military budget, since samples only of the new arms are tobe  obtained.   Germany has no intention of infringing  the articles of the Treatygoverning the demilitarized zones and  she will  accept  supervision of the execution ofthe Convention provided that other states will do the like.     The resemblance of  these reorganization  proposals,  coupled  with  the recentdevelopment of organizations for &quot; Voluntary Labour &quot; and for &quot; Youth Training,&quot; tothe &quot; New Model Army &quot; of General von Seeckt is  immediately apparent and confirmsmy view expressed in a  former  paper that it is on  the lines of  General  von  Seeckt&apos;sproject that the Reichswehrministerium is working.     It is desirable to recall his proposals.   Basing his views on the decisive value  buthigh cost of modern armaments, on the longer training  required  for their  effectiveemployment, and on the need of constant change to keep abreast of invention, Generalvon Seeckt proposed a dual army to consist of      (a)  A  striking  force  of at least  200,000  men voluntarily enlisted for a term            varying  from  3 to  6 years, highly  trained,  perfectly  equipped,  fully            mechanized, endowed with complete reserves  of material  and capable of            taking the field at full strength on the day  on which war is declared.     (b)  A  second line or defence army, formed by universal service as a militia on  the            Swiss model,  with an initial training of 2 to 3  months,  followed by            subsequent short repetition courses.   For  reasons of expense the defence            army wovdd be on a low scale of equipment and trained mainly for frontier            and home defence.     (c)  For its further equipment in modern arms the defence army would depend on            the mobilization of industry after the declaration of  war.   A high state of            preparation for industrial mobilization  is therefore an essential  element in            the scheme.     (d)  The pre-militar-y training of youth  designed to  produce bodily fitness and a            patriotic outlook would precede the militia  training, and would render that            training fully  effective.     It  is this  striking  force capable  on  the  day of  declaration of war of  breaking-through their covering forces while still in  the throes of mobilization, which excites thefears of the French and Polish General Staffs.     The above are undoubtedly the aims with which, and the basis on which, Germanydesires to reorganize her military forces.    * c./. German aide memoire to France of 30th August, 1932.    f c./.

     As  regards  the  German  proposals  for  equality of  rights, the  Powers  chiefly concerned may meet them in one of three ways :      (i)  The present  proposals for rearmament may be accepted for the ,period of a first            Disarmament Convention.     (ii)  The demand for equality of status may be refused.    (iii)  Equality may be secured, not by increasing German  armaments, hut by other            States reducing their armaments to German levels.     I will deal here with alternatives (i) and  (ii) :  alternative-(iii) will  be considered inthe following chapter.Alternative (i).     Assuming that the proposals  are accepted,  that Germany observes the limitations of the Convention and that she makes no marked increase in her military budget, theeffect of  the present proposals on her military forces in  1938 the  year in which thefirst Disarmament Convention may be supposed to terminate and  &quot;that in which theFrench Army will  be least effective owing to the large decrease  in  the size of itsanuual contingents will be as follows :                          (a)  iReiehsheer and Defence Force.     Although  the reduction of the period of  service will allow the Reichsheer to buildup a small reserve of highly trained men, not only this reserve  but  also the  whole ofthe trained Militia will be required in 1938 to mobilize the striking force of 14 infantry and  3  cavalry-divisions at which, in a former chapter, I concluded the  Reichswehr-ministerium to be aiming.     The defence force or Grenzschutz which the militia is nominally intended to supply will  still, therefore, have to be  found from  men of the Associations, the now olderex-service men and local police.     The  formation  of  the militia on  a compulsory basis  will, however,  have theimportant effect of  providing that machinery for  the registration and allocation of thewhole man power of  Germany which is at present lacking.  The mobilization of the striking  force,  of the  defence  forces and of  industry will thus  he facilitated andquickened.     The possession in  peace  of &quot; sample&quot;  aircraft, tanks,  &amp;c,  will result in :the striking force  being able to mobilize their  now forbidden arms and services more quickly and with a higher standard of training.   The concession will allow of smallreserves of such material being formed, but the  cost of the new and  expensive arms,and especially of creating an effective air force, will not, as  our own experience proves,leave any margin within the restricted budget for  the collection of  expensive reserves of materials.                            (b) Industrial mobilization.     It is possible to exaggerate the effect of  the  possession of &quot; sample &quot; weapons onthe speeding up of  industrial mobilization.  The  opportunity of  giving &quot; educationalorders&quot; is of value, but there is little room for doubt  that  Germany already  possessessuch &quot; samples &quot; and that the process specifications, jigs and gauges  required  for theirreproduction are prepared or in preparation.   Freedom to experiment will no  doubt be valuable and the German heavy armament industry will be  able to  enter  the world markets and will thus improve its power of expansion.   In these directions the initialwar  output capacity of German  industry will be increased.   I consider, however, thatthe great expansion of output required for the mobilization of further  formations andfor war on a great scale will not, in 1938 as in 1932, take place until  after  the sixthmonth of the war.                               (c)  Training of youth.     Simultaneously with the proposals for the reorganization  of the  army, we have therecent developments known as  the  Voluntary Labour  Army and ;the Youth  TrainingCamps in which,  in addition to sports  and  physical training, Instruction is  given insuch definitely  military subjects as drill,  use of ground, judging distance and miniaturerifle  shooting.   The value of this an Germany&apos;s military organization lies not  so muchin the provision of additional  effectives as in  the co-ordination of &quot;the  similar militarytraining given to the  youth-of Germany in the-political  and sports associations and inthe opportunity which the camps provide for the selection of ^potential leaders.A
CHAPTER  IV.                                  DlSAUMAMENT.     In the foregoing chapter the question of a German rearmament has been discussed on  the supposition  that  Germany obtains permission to possess all  those types of armament which are  now forbidden by the Peace Treaty.   Germany, however, representsherself as being  ready to accept  any form of  qualitative disarmament to which allcountries will agree.   My own belief is that Germany is less interested in the reductionof the armaments of others, except in so  far as it tends to reduce their  military power,than in the right  to  re-arm herself.     (6666)                                                                   B     My general conclusion from the  above investigation is that Germany in 1938, asin 1932, will still  be far  from creating  the  army  of General  Von Seeckt.  Hermobilizatiou  will be  quicker, her striking force better  equipped and  better trained,and  she will possess a small air force.   On the other hand, her  striking  force  can hardly exceed  the  present  limit  of 14  infantry  divisions and  the formation of  a2nd Line Army and of an effective  frontier defence force will still depend on the outputof industry mobilized after the outbreak  of war.  In 1938, therefore, as  in  1932,Germany,  if  subjected to the restrictions  she  now proposes and if no countervailingrestrictions were placed on  her  neighbours, would still  be  at the mercy of France orPoland.   The step  she proposes to take is deliberately planned as the penultimate stagetowards complete re-armament later.  She  will in fact, during this period, be engagedin erecting the framework  for a  large  and rapid expansion both of personnel  andmaterial, which will mean a considerable  saving of time when her final plans are putinto execution.     The  ultimate  stage of complete rearmament will presumably be based on  theplan of reorganization of General  Von Seeckt.   It is  a well thought  out  scheme ofwaging war and is  suited to the  conditions of Germany on  her  emergence from therestrictions of the Peace Treaty, but the creation of a large  professional army equippedon a high  scale and with large air forces will prove immensely costly and may require some years to achieve.     It  is  difficult to prophecy the result  of a war waged when Germany has  carriedout her full  programme after a previous  period of partial rearmament.  The  futuredepends upon  a  number of factors political,  economic and  military which it  isimpossible to forecast.   Assuming,  however, a reasonably favourable situation for germany as regards military alliances, I cannot but think that her intensive preparations,her large and virile population and her  immense industrial resources would give  herthe victory in  a  struggle with France  and with France&apos;s present allies.   The inter -vention of Russia or  of   ourselves for  or  against  Germany  would probably  be decisive.Alternative (ii).    This  alternative for dealing with the German proposals  is that the  demand for&quot; sample&quot; armaments should be refused without any compensating reduction of  the armaments of other powers.    General  von Schleicher, the Minister of Defence, has  stated quite definitely that,in such an event,  Germany will proceed  openly to  re-arm.  I do not think that theGermans are  bluffing, and in the event of a refusal of their proposal, we may expect tosee the early  formation of tank  units, military air squadrons, &amp;c, followed possibly bymodified conscription.  France  would not remain indifferent to such a breach of theTreaty.  It is  a  matter  of  speculation  as to the probable course  of action  of  theFrench Government, but it may be presumed  that a  moderate Government would atleast appeal to the Council  of the  League,  which clearly could not settle the question,while a Government of the Right, if  public  opinion  were excited,  might proceed tore-occupy  the Rhine bridgeheads.   This would  produce an  extremely critical situation.     It is impossible to say what might then happen, but it may be affirmed with somecertainty that France  would take steps to prevent, by one means or another, a deliberateand methodical rearmament by Germany  in these conditions.
     I will now examine alternative (iii), which is the proposal that  all States  should accept the same restriction upon their arms as are at present imposed on Germany, withthe double object of giving her equality of rights and at the same time preventing any measure of rearmament on her part.  It seems hardly probable that even the surrenderby other States of all the arms denied to Germnny would reconcile her to the terms ofthe Peace Treaty unless quantitative restrictions  both as to personnel  and material were accepted by all as well.  I will, however, confine  my comments to the effect of universalqualitative disarmament.     The question is &quot; what will happen at the conclusion of  the  life of the Disarma-ment Convention, when States will be free to rearm unless they agree  to the contrary ? &quot;The answer  is, in  my  view,  that victory will  go, other things being equal,  to  theState or group of  States with  the largest population,  the greatest industrial resources and  the  most complete plans for turning over industry  to war uses.  The  nationwith such assets  and  the determination to re-arm must  obviously start  with  agreat advantage.   To take  the case of Germany, it  may be  presumed that, between1932 and 1938 (always supposing that the intentions  of her  Government and  peopleremain the same), she  will make immense preparations both on the  personnel andmaterial  side for large expansion.  It  follows then that in ] 938 we and other states will start  from scratch in the rearmaments race while  Germany will  have had a flyingstart and be some distance down the course.     Believing as I  do  that Germany is firmly determined  to rearm  and that  her present  proposals are intended to lay the foundations of her  plan, it seems to me thatfor the States who emerged victors in the War voluntarily to  place themselves  in  thesame position of military inferiority  as Germany is to-day will be to throw away  theonly means of curbing German militarism in the near future.   We and other powers will  start handicapped.in a rearmaments race of unknown extent and at gigantic costin which we may very well be beaten.     I have  reviewed in the previous and the present chapters the possible alternativesolutions of  the German demand for equality of status.  The first alternative,  that ofconceding &quot; sample&quot;  armaments, has obvious  disadvantages  and dangers.   It allowsGermany  to  prepare for complete rearmament  which  we  shall  hardly be able  toprevent,  when the  Disarmament Convention expires.  The  second alternative,  the refusal of the demand, will  mean an attempt  at immediate rearmament and  a rapidapproach to a crisis.   The third alternative, that of the reduction of all other States tothe  German level seems to me, in view of the latter&apos;s openly  declared intentions, to befraught with  disastrous consequences.  Whatever the difficulties and  dangers attendantupon the other alternatives, I consider that this third course is the worst of all.     I would  add a word  upon  the state of  our own  armaments.  In the past our power has been used in the interests of  peace and right and its disappearance would remove one of the great elements  of stability in  a changing and  restless world.  our armed forces are not measured solely  by the armaments of other Powers but  by ourImperial  needs.  Almost the sole  responsibility for the defence of the Empire lies uponthe  shoulders of this country and any  proposal which aims at reducing these forces tothe level  of German armaments would leave the Empire completely defenceless.     The communications  of the  Empire are long and  must be protected.   In spite ofthe new status which the Dominions have assumed, we still shoulder almost the entiredefence of the Empire, apart from local defence.     Acting  upon the ten year rule we  have  been steadily reducing our armamentswhile others have been arming to the teeth.  Now that  this rule is no longer operativeand the European sky  is darkening, we  must  reconsider  the position of  the  armed forces of the  Crown if we desire to pull our full weight in the maintenance of peace onthe  Continent.   So far as the Army is concerned, it is clearly necessary to speed  up ourrate of mobilization and to put our  coast defences in  order.   The  Army is  not in asufficient  state of preparedness to intervene  effectively in a  European theatre and isincapable of making any contribution towards  implementing the  Locarno guarantee, a fact which may weaken  our influence in the preservation of peace.     If in the difficult. times ahead,  we are to maintain  our weight  in the councils ofEurope  we  must  assuredly maintain  our strength,  and our  armed forces must  be efficient and capable of performing the  tasks that may be required of them.         &quot; The abstention  of  England from any unnecessary  interference in the affairs     of Europe is  the consequence, not of her decline of power, but of her increased     strength.&quot;  (Disraeli in 1866.)
                                 CHAPTER V.                                  SUGGESTIONS.    J.  have endeavoured to set out  the main  factors of the situation and futurepossibilities  not only  as affecting the  Continent of  Europe,  but also  ourselves.Whatever else may be obscure, one clear deduction is that the international situation is becoming very critical and we must make up our minds what course to steer.    If we could put back the clock, we seem to be standing once more in the presenceof another Agadir crisis, when the actors definitely took  their places in  the  wings forthe great drama of  1914.  After Agadir  the  Germans,  convinced  that  war wasa certainty, created  two  fresh army corps, to which the  French replied  by going to three years&apos; service.   They could not  call more men to the colours for there  were noneleft to call.  The situation is somewhat similar now.  Under a demand for equality of rights which no reasonable person could refuse, the militarists  in Germany are makinga definite bid for rearmament and. a reversal  by force  of arms, if necessary, of theverdict of the  Great  War.   Whichever  alternative is  selected  for dealing with theGerman  demand, nothing  can prevent them being free to  embark  upon  completerearmament in 1938, as I have shown in previous chapters.   A refusal to concede thedemand now without any concession as  regards disarmament  by the victorious  states might precipitate a crisis.  Nothing except a complete change  of heart  in Germany ora rapprochement between her and France neither of them very likely contingencies can in my opinion  avert an ultimate clash, which will  certainly begin  on the Vistulaand may end on the Rhine.    The French are convinced of this and war is openly talked of by moderate men allover France.   Further sabre rattling across the Rhine might drive the French  to fighta preventive war, as Bismarck planned in 1875, before the &quot; leain &quot;  years commence in1935 and at a  time when Germany cannot possibly make a fight of it.    In this critical situation it is not surprising that France turns to us for  assistance.The greater the German threat, the greater is the French need of armaments, and if some concession has to be made, she will contemplate a reduction only in exchange forfirm guarantees.  It is true that the Locarno Treaty contains  an undertaking that weshall  &quot;come  immediately   to  the  assistance of the Power  against  whom the actcomplained of  is directed.&quot;   France does  not  consider this  guarantee sufficient.  Itlacks in her eyes precision  both as to amount  and as to time.  What  she  requires is some  pi-omise of immediate assistance  on land with  a definite number  of divisions.A pact embodying some  such proposal may be pressed  upon us not only as a means ofaverting the failure of the Disarmament Conference and  perhaps the end of the League,but also to save the  peace  of  the world.   It is a moving appeal and our unselfishadherence to yet one  more  pact has  undoubted attractions as a contribution to world peace.   We have in the past made great sacrifices to that end, and we will continue tostrain every nerve to keep the peace, but I am doubtful  whether the acceptance of sucha pact  would,  in the long run, materially assist  in its preservation.  The service as at present constituted  are not in a position to put it into effect.    If  wc stand out  and join neither one group nor the other and refuse to tie our hands  with further  pacts,  our  strength  and our influence will  be immeasurablyincreased.  Ability to mediate, to apply  pressure, even to threaten at a time of crisis,gives  us an  infinitely stronger hand to  play in  the  interests of peace than  if our military support were mortgaged in advance in a quarrel which was not ours  and inwhich  the  aggressor  was decided by international committee.  The maintenance ofpeace requires that a nation can  use its influence - in this cause in proportion as  it is sufficiently respected  and sufficiently strong to act effectively.   It is no secret after theexperience of the  last War that the  side on which the  United Kingdom  throws itsweight must win.   So long, therefore, as we  keep clear of entanglements we may beable to act as a balancing force to maintain peace.    Perhaps the greatest  danger  of  signing a Guarantee Pact is  the  effect it wouldhave  upon the Empire.   In  the last  two Imperial   Conferences the status of theDominions has radically  changed and  the ties have loosened.   At Ottawa  an economiclink has been  forged  which  may,  we  hope, be the precursor  of  more  intimateco-operation.   But it is difficult to tie ourselves  up with Europe and  consolidate theEmpire  at the  same  time.   General  Smuts expressed  this  view  when  lecturing atOxford on  &quot; World Peace &quot; on 11th November, 1929.    He said          &quot; The arguments  against a League provided with military sanctions seem to    me only to gain additional force  with the passage of  time.  I  feel  convinced  that
    the Dominions of the British Empire would decline  to  fight the wars of Central    Europe in the future, and would  in  the last  resort  break away from the League    rather than remain in it under such  obligations.  Tt is clear to me that unless the    Protocol had been torpedoed it would have torpedoed the League, and I consider    the vetoing of the  Protocol the  best service  which  Sir Austen  Chamberlain has    rendered the League, the Empire and the World.&quot;    It is not only in the West that  there is cause for anxiety ;  the discussion of theLytton Report may well prove critical for the League and for our interests in the  far east.   So far as the League is conceited, I venture to suggest  that the course ofevents in the last year has proved that sanctions should have no place in the Covenant.When it  was drafted,  I believe that they  formed  no  part  of the Anglo-Americanconception of the League and our negotiators gave way to the French view only as a compromise.   Article 16 proved to be the cause of the American withdrawal.  It hasbeen a matter of grave concern to our Dominions as well  as to other neutral States.  Ifit were to disappear it is at least conceivable that the  U.S.A. might enter the League.She certainly will  not do so while it remains.    As regards  Japan :  we cannot condone the flouting of treaties or the breaking ofpledges, but if a settlement can be effected on the Manchurian question  it would addimmensely to our military security and to  our economic advantage in the Far East.A friendly Japan is the best antidote to a hostile  Russia.   As difficulties pile up inthe West it becomes more essential to try to secure  some degree of tranquillity in theFar East.    If I may sum up my conclusions, which in some instances I fear  go far into thepolitical field, they are as follows :      (i) The German leaders are  deliberately planning  a small rearmament, which  is           in fact a penultimate and essential stage towards the emergence of Germany           as a powerfully armed militarist State prepared to fight for the reversal  of           what is left of the  Peace Treaties.  If German policy continues  on the           present  lines,  it is  to be expected that Poland  will be  attacked  when           Germany is ready,  and that the turn  of France will come next.   The           critical period will probably begin after  1938, if  there is a Disarmament           Convention ; otherwise it may come sooner.    (ii) There is no practical  means of holding  Germany bound indefinitely to the            Treaty or of preventing her advance towards her goal.    (iii) The situation in the Far East is of great gravity owing to the exposed position           of our bases and the danger to our trade.   Without condoning Japanese           excesses,  we ought to try and reach a solution  of  the  Manchurian  dispute           which will earn their gratitude and make co-operation  with them possible           in the future.    (iv) We ought to  keep clear of entanglements and make no  promise of military           support to any group of Powers.   An attitude  of neutrality, if we remain           strong, will increase greatly our weight in the Councils of Europe.    (v) The consolidation of the Empire and the safety  of Imperial communications is           a matter of first importance.   We ought not to take  any steps in Europe           which would cause Great  Britain and  the Dominions to follow divergent           policies.    (vi) In doing our part in any  Disarmament Treaty that may be entered upon, we           must keep our armed forces efficient and able to  perform the tasks that may           be required of  them.     I have made no reference to our relations with the United States, as being beyondthe scope  of this paper, though successive British Governments have  declared that agood  understanding with them is an  axiom  of  our  foreign policy.  I appreciate thatthe co-ordination of this policy  with the suggestion made with  regard to  Japan  inparagraph (iii) above will be a delicate and a difficult matter.
