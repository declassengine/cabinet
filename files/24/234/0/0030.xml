THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT^ 2 0                 Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1932.SECRET.CP.  380 (32).                                CABINET.IMPERIAL PREFERENCE  AND  MANDATED TERRITORIES.            Memorandxim by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.     I WAS  requested at  last  Wednesday^ meeting of  the  Cabinet  (see Conclusions 58 (32), paragraph 5) to enquire into the nature of the advice given in the past by the Law Officers as to our right to give Imperial  Preference  to territories under a &quot; B &quot; mandate, such as Tanganyika, and if necessary to consult the present Law Officers.     2.   The  question  of  extending  the system  of  Imperial  Preference  to Mandated Territories was first  considered in connection with the Finance Act, 1919, at a meeting of the  War Cabinet held on the 14th May, 1919.   It  was further  considered at a subsequent meeting on  the 8th July, 1919,  when the Chancellor of  the Exchequer was authorised to insert in  the Finance Act a clause &quot; to extend the system of Imperial Preference  to any countries which in future might come under British  protection,  or in respect of which a Mandate of the League of Nations is exercised by the Government of any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions.&quot;     3.   In June, 1921,.the High Commissioner for New Zealand asked for advice regarding Samoan goods entering the United Kingdom,  and the. opportunity  was taken to consider generally the question of granting preference to &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; mandated territories.     4.   With the concurrence Of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, an opinion wafe sought from the Law Officers whether &quot; there is any objection to the grant Of preference in the United  Kingdom to goods which are the produce of-     (a) territories  to be administered  under  &apos; B &apos;  Mandates  (assuming  the          provisions of the draft Mandates remain substantially in their present          form);     (b) territories administered under &apos; C &apos; Mandates.&quot;     5.  The Law  Officers reported on the 21st September,  .1921, &quot; that, in  ouropinion,  there  is no objection to the grant of preference in the United kingdom to the goods which are the produce of (a) territories to be administered under &apos; B &apos;Mandates, assuming the provisions of  the  draft Mandates remain substantially in their present  form, or  (6)  territories  administered  under &apos; C &apos; Mandates.Neither of these classes of territories can, in our opinion, be regarded as &apos; foreigncountries.&apos; &quot;     Copies of  the Colonial Office letter of the 22nd August, 1921, and of the LawOfficers&apos; Report of the 21st September, 1921, are appended to this Memorandum.     The Mandates for all the Territories in question, as  approved by the Councilof the League of Nations, were substantially in the form of the drafts Avhich were submitted to the Law  Officers.    6.  No subsequent opinion has. been sought, from the Law Officers regardingthe grant of preference to &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; Mandated Territories, but on a numberof occasions it has been found necessary to invite them to consider  this question      [7822]Copy  No.
in relation to Palestine.   In each case reference has been made to the Report ofthe 21st September,&apos; 1921^ and it has been pointed out that, if Palestine  is a&quot; foreign country &quot; in the sense that it is not part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions,so also, in that narrow sense, are  Protectorates and &quot; B &quot; mandated territories.    7.   The Law Officers have on each occasion reported that, after reconsideringthis question in the light of the Colonial Office letter, they still consider that theextension of Imperial preference to  Palestine would be  a  breach  of the most-favoured-nation clauses of British Commercial Treaties, as the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, and the other relative international  documents,  do constitutePalestine a foreign or third nation within the meaning  of the Treaties.   TheLaw  Officers have not,  however, given any  indication  that they consider  itnecessary to revise the opinion expressed by their predecessors in their Report ofthe 21st September. 1921, in so far as &quot; B &quot; Mandates are concerned.                                                                 P.  C.-L.    Colonial Office, November 5, 1932.32239.                            No. 15A.                                (GENERAL.)       (Grant of preference to goods which are the produce of territories                administered under &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; mandates.)                       Colonial Office to Law Officers.Gentlemen,                               Downing Street, August 22, 1921.    In your Report of the 18th  February, 1921,* you advised the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that in your opinion it was  impossible, in view of theCommercial Treaties with Italy and Portugal, and of other Treaties in similarterms, to extend to Palestine  the preference  granted in  the United Kingdom to goods grown, produced, or manufactured  in the British Empire.  The Report inquestion further stated that Palestine would appear to fall within paragraph 4of Article  22  of the  Covenant  of  the  League of  Nations and  not withinparagraph 6, and that in your opinion Great Britain as a Mandatory was in theposition of a trustee of the League.    2.  The question has now arisen whether there is any objection,  on accountof the provisions of  the Commercial Treaties referred to above, to the  grant ofpreference in the United  Kingdom to goods  grown,  produced, or manufactured in other territories administered or to be  administered under  a Mandate by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia,the Dominion of New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.  The territories in question fall into  two categories, viz. :      (a) those which are  to be administered under what are known  as  &quot; B *&apos;          Mandates, i.e., East Africa (British), Togoland  (British),  and  the          Cameroons   (British).   The  draft  Mandates  relating  to  these          territories are enclosed herewith;  they  have not yet been approved by          the Council of the  League of Nations;    (b) those which  are administered under what  are known as &quot; C &quot; Mandates,          viz.,  German South-West Africa, German Samoa, Nauru,  and  the          German  Possessions  in  the Pacific  Ocean  situated  south of  the          Equator,  other than German Samoa and Nauru.    The Mandates in respect of these territories have  been approved by  theCouncil of the League of Nations.  Copies are enclosed herewith, t    3.  The &quot; B &quot; Mandates have been drawn up in accordance with paragraph 5of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, whilst the &quot; C &quot; Mandateshave been drawn up  under paragraph 6 of the same Article.            ...         .&apos;.,,V No. .12A,..,.... , i  ....     jt (Cmd. 128-1), (Cmd. 1350), (Cmd. 1201), ((Jmd. 1202), (Omd. 1203).

47511.                            Report.    We have taken the matter into our consideration and in obedience to yourcommands have the honour to report that in our opinion there is no objection tothe grant of preference in the United Kingdom  to  the  goods which are  the produce of (a)  territories to be administered under  &quot; B &quot; Mandates, assuming that the provisions of the draft Mandates remain substantially in their present form,  or (6) territories administered under   i C &quot; Mandates.  Neither of these classes of territories can, in our opinion, be regarded  as &quot; foreign countries.&quot;                                          We have, &amp;c.                                                 GORDON HEWART.                                                ERNEST M. POLLOCK.Law Officers&apos; Department,             September 21,  1921.B    4.  It would appear from your Report of the 18th February, already referredto, that the test whether preference in the United Kingdom can be extended tothe products of Mandated territories is whether such territories are, or are not,foreign countries in relation to the United Kingdom.   The terms of the draftMandates in the case of territories to be administered under &quot; B &quot; Mandates, andof the Mandates in the case of territories administered under &quot; C &quot; Mandates,accordingly require consideration, and I am to call attention to the following paragraphs, viz., in the case of East Africa (British),  Articles 3, 7  and  10;  inthe case of Togoland and the Cameroons, Articles  2, 6 and 9; and in the  case ofthe other territories, Article 2.    5.  I am to request you to be good enough to  take the papers into your con-sideration and advise the Secretary of State whether, in your opinion, there is any objection to the grant of preference in the United Kingdom to goods whichare the produce of     (a) territories  to  be administered  under  &quot;  B&quot;  Mandates  (assuming  the          provisions of the draft Mandates remain substantially in their present          form);    (b) territories administered under &quot;iQ &quot; Mandates.    I am also to ask for any observations which you may be good enough to offer on the subject generally.                                                 I am, &amp;c.                                                     HENRY LAMBERT.
