EMPIRE OONTFNT.      Memorandum by the President of-the Board of Trade.     I annex, for the information of my colleagues, amemorandum prepared in the Board of Trade on the proportionof empire labour and materials required to secure imperial preference.    It is there suggested that the requirementshould be increased from 25$ to 5Qj  in respect of certain wideclasses of manufactured goods (iron and steel and manufacturesthereof, machinery, implements and tools, cutlery, scientificinstruments and appliances) chosen by reference to the representations which have been received, from United kingdom manufacturers.     With the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretaries of State for the Dominions and theColonies I propose to make such an Order at es early a date as possible.V/.R.rd  of  Trade,18th November,  1932.
                        EMPIRF CONTENT.                        -   1. When Imperial Preference -was instituted in the UnitedKingdom in 1919 it was laid down in Section 8 of the finance act of that year that &quot;Goods shall not be daemed to have beenmanufactured in the British Empire .......... unless suchproportion of their value as is prescribed by regulations madeby the Board of Trade is the result of labour within  theBritish Empire&quot;.    The proportion prescribed by the Board ofTrade was a minimum of 25 per cent., this proportion includingthe cost to the manufacturer of any materials  of Empire originentering into the composition of the goods.   2. Until the passing of the Import Duties Act, 1932, thelevel of the percentage adopted was not a matter of primary importance in view of the narrow range of manufactured goodscovered by the United Kingdom tariff.   But even within thatnarrow range representations against the lowness of thepercentage were made by manufacturers in this country,particularly in regard to motor cars, hosiery latch needlesand optical goods.   No change, however, was made in the2b per cent, requirement except in the case of optical goodswhere in 1926 the&quot;percentage was raised to 75.   It should be observed, however, that the alteration in this case wasdefended more on defence than on trade grounds.   3. When the Import Duties Act, 1932, was passed, an order was made by the Board of Trade under Section 6 and the third schedule to the Act maintaining the 25 per cent, requirementalthough it was felt at the time that some reconsideration ofthe matter would be necessary.   4* Since the Act came into operation there have beenconstant representations from a number of United Kingdomtrades (e.g. typewriters, motor cars, wireless-goods,                   -photographic sensitised materials) that the 25 per cent.
requirement is too low.   These representations practically allrest on the oasis that the United States manufacturer,  by ajudicious use of his proximity to Canada and&apos;by the lowness ofthe percentage, is enabled to enter for preference goods whichare in effect United States goods by performing on them inCanada a minimum of work amounting in some cases to little morethan an assembly of parts or even packing.   Elsewhere  in theEmpire comparable conditions do not generally obtain though some representations have been received about the possibilityof the use of the Irish Free State as a base.   5. When the United Kingdom adopted the 25 per cent,  contentrule in 1919, a similar rule 7/as in force in most other partsof the Empire.   Since that date there have been growingdivergencies of practice in different parts of the Empire, themost recent being the increase in the percentage to 50  by canadian  1929.   The Imperial Conference of 1930 directed that an enquiry should be made into the possibility of arriving at acommon understanding with regard to the principles which should determine the distinction between Empire and non-Empire goods.The matter was thereupon taken up by the Imperial EconomicCommittee and in their report presented to the ottawa conference they arrived at the following tentative conclusions:-          &quot;28. ........ We should hope to see, in the     conditions adopted by all Empire countries, the fixation of     a normal minimum applicable to most classes of goods and     the same minimum applied, as far as practicable, to the     same kind of goods.   We should hope that the exceptions     from the normal would be few and specific .....           29.  We have not examined representatives of     industries in detail but we have general grounds for     believing that a move towards 50 per cent., with     exceptions above and possibly below, allowing for the     cases of material we have mentioned, would be practicable     and not unreasonable.          We recommend therefore - on the assumption that it     is agreed to aim at a normal requirement of 50 per cent.     for Empire content - that there Bhould be an enquiry to     ascertain the steps that would have to be taken by way of
9 ^ (\k, v J     exception or modification of conditions as to excluded     materials, etc. so that when the decision is reached to     put the 50 per cent, standard into operation, the     conditions will have been settled vhich are necessary to     enable that standard to work smoothly&quot;.   6. The unofficial representatives of United Kingdomindustries who were at Ottawa during the Conference passed thefollowing resolution          &quot;The United Kingdom Ottawa Industrial Committee     having considered the Report on the definition of Empire     Goods, recommends that Empire Content to qualify for     Preference shall be 75  of the total cost, provided that     specified raw materials and partly prepared  materials are     excluded from the calculation of such cost, and the     individual industries be consulted in the preparation of     such list of specified raw materials and partly prepared     materials with which they are concerned.   The Committee     further consider that the list of specified articles, the     definition of cost and content and the figure of 75% should     be uniform throughout the Empire&quot;.     At a subsequent meeting held with the Committee, it was clear that the exemption for certain foreign raw materials and semi-manufactured goods was to apply to all such materials and goods as were now used as a matter of industrial practice and convenience.   The compilation of such a list on an Empirebasis would present grave difficulties in view of thedivergent manufacturing and producing interests of thedifferent parts of the Empire.   Moreover, it was explained tothe Committee that, so far as the United Kingdom were concerned,new legislation would be necessary in order to give effect totheir proposals, but that the Board of Trade, in view of their powers under existing legislation, were already coxisidering thequestion of an increase in the Empire content from the25 per cent, basis in respect of certain classes of goods.   7. In the Committee which at Ottawa considered the reportof the Imperial Economic Committee it became clear that itwould be impossible there and then to  arrive at any uniformsystem.   The United Kingdom representatives said that theywere inclined to favour a proposal to adhere generally to25 per cent, but to make exceptions in an upward direction
i-j tj -where there was a clear case for doing so.   Alternatively theyhuu no objection in principle to a proposal to fix a general level of 50 per cent, and make exceptions which would generally be downwards where enquiry might show that this was equitable;for instance, in regard to certain kinds of textiles, of paper and of leather.   8. Eventually the Ottawa Conference passed the followingresolution:-          &quot;With regard to the determination of the percentage     of Empire Content necessary to secure preferential tariff     treatment, the Conference draws the attention of the     several Governments of the Commonwealth to the     importance of this subject, and recommends that each of     the Governments of the Commonwealth should investigate,     as rapidly as possible, the standard of Empire Content     which should be required by them for the import under     preferential rates of the different classes of goods,     bearing in mind, the following principles:        (a) That though it must rest with each Government to             decide what standard it will require, a greater             degree of uniformity throughout the Commonwealth             is desirable;        (b)jThe standard required should not be such as to             defeat or frustrate the intention of the             preferential rate of duty conceded to any class             of goods-&quot;   9. The effect of the Ottawa resolution is to leave theUnited Kingdom free to -adopt the line best suited to her owncircumstances, always bearing in mind the desirability of someapproach to uniformity throughout the Empire.   Under the altered conditions created, by the Import Duties Act, theremust be some departure from the 25 per cent, requirement andin all the circumstances a departure to 50 per cent, in thecase of those classes of goods, for which enquiry snows it tobe necessary, seems to offer the best solution.   A 50 per cent.requirement with downward revision in the case of goods whichcould not meet this requirement, would not offer any advantage,but would merely introduce unnecessary administrative difficulties in dealing with the numerous cases for which
special provision would have to he made.    It would not be possible to couple a 50 per cent,  requirement with exemption for specified classes of raw materials and semi-manufacturedgoods without fresh legislation, which might mean considerable delay.   The percentage requirement itself can be increased by board of Trade Order under the provisions of the Finance Act1919 and of the Import Duties Act, 1932 (see paragraphs 1 and2).   10. The adoption of this plan would  , it is suggested, be a contribution towards uniformity.   The somewhat inconclusivediscussions at Ottawa seemed to centre round a 50 per cent.requirement with or without a list of exempted materials.   NewZealand has already adopted a 50 per cent, requirement with alist of exempted materials and it Is understood that India hassimilar proposals in mind.   Canada has adopted a 50 per cent.requirement without any list of exempted materials but withspecial treatment for cottons.   With the experience gained itwould be quite easy at a later date, if necessary, to change toa 50 per cent, requirement with exceptions at 25 per cent, or some other figure for particular classes of goods.   11. Certain United Kingdom manufacturers have pressed for ahigher empire content than 50 per cent, for particular classesof goods.   It is not altogether clear whether their object isto prevent the United States manufacturer competing in this market at all or to force him to set up an organisation in thiscountry.   It may be doubted whether a 50 per cent, requirementwill be sufficient  in ell cases to induce the United Statesmanufacturer to move here; it is hoped that it may have this effect in  some circumstances but obviously the conditions arcdifferent  in each trade and no general rule can be formulated.It has to be borne  in mind, moreover, that the adoption of ahigher percentage than 50 would give a lead to other parts of the
                                                        9 C 9Empire and consequently might involve difficulties for many-branches of the United Kingdom export trade, not only in theDominions and India but also in the Colonial markets.   Eventhe adoption of the 50 per cent, rule by Canada in 1929 gave rise to complaints by various United Kingdom cmanufacturers, andin partioular the cotton industry.   12. It is suggested, in these circumstances, that 50 percent, is high enough at least as a first step.   The situationcan always be reconsidered when experience of the effect of a50 per cent, rate upon the selected classes of goods has been gained.   Any immediate -general advance above that rate at thepresent time would make the conditions for Imperial Preferenceconsiderably more difficult and might in many cases conflict with one of the principles laid down at the Ottawa Conference -that &quot;the standard required shall not be such as to defeat orfrustrate the intention of the preferential rate of dutyconceded to any class of goods&quot;.   13. It is proposed, therefore, that at an early date anOrder should be made increasing the &quot;Empire content&quot; to 50%in respect of certain wide classes of manufactured goods suchas iron and steel and manufactures thereof, machinery,implements and tools, cutlery, scientific instruments and appliances, etc.   These classes will be chosen by referenceto the representations which have been received from UnitedKingdom manufacturers and the test will be whether theDominions will be reasonably able to satisfy the condition,and whether the United Kingdom would object to the same testbeing applied to her trade by other parts of the Empireincluding the Colonies.   The exact definition of tho classes towhich the new requirement is to be applied will, of course, bea matter for discussion with the Commissioners of Customs and excise, but by proceeding at once to deal with wide classes of
goods, rather than with individual classes such astypewriters,  it is hoped to avoid a succession of Orders,  eachdealing with a few classes of goods and appearing to hespecifically aimed at Canada.oard of Trade,  17th November,  1932,
