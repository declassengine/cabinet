Copy of a letter addressed  by the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER    on 1st July, 1932, to         The  London County Council.         The  Metropolitan  Boroughs Standing Joint Committee.         The  County Councils Association.         The  Association of Municipal Corporations.         The  Urban District Councils Association.         The  Rural District  Councils Association.         The  Association of Education Committees.                                   Treasury Chambers,                                          Whitehall, S.W.I.                                                1st July, 1932.Sm,  In  considering what further action can be taken  to lighten  theheavy burdens at present borne by the community  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have given attention to  the  question of reduction inthe expenditure of Local Authorities.  They  are aware that a  general circular letter on  this subject was addressed in September last  to Local Authorities by the thenMinister  of  Health and  similar circulars were  sent  by  other ministers as  to limitation of expenditure on  roads  and as toeconomies in education.  Many Authorities have since devoted imv:hattention to reducing or reviewing the possibilities of reducing their expenditure.  His Majesty&apos;s Government feel, however, that further action, alike  early  and decisive,  is requisite and they desire withthat object to  invite the co-operation of the London County Council,the Metropolitan Boroughs  Standing  Joint  Committee and  themain central associations of Local Authorities.  His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly invite these bodies to combine in  the  appointment  of a committee to consider the wholefield of local expenditure and make recommendations at the earliestpossible date  for ensuring reductions in such expenditure, whetherdefrayed from  Exchequer  Grants,  Rates  or  other sources  andwhether or  not  imposed on Local Authorities as a duty by statute,order, rule  or regulations.   They have in  mind  a committee of a chairman and  twelve  members,  made up of  representatives asfollows :     London County Council      ...     ...    ...     ...    2    Metropolitan. Boroughs  Standing  Joint Committee    1County Councils Association  ...           ...    ...    3Association of  Municipal Corporations     ...    ...    3Urban District Councils Association  ...     ...    ...    2Rural  District  Councils Association  ...     ...    ...    1Association of Education Committees      ...    ...    1The Committee would appoint its own chairman.
II  would also at  discretion  appoint  sub-committees to  considerdifferent branches  of  local expenditure, adding  to  such sub-com-niittees as thought desirable further members of Local Authoritieshaving special knowledge of  the subject  in question.  Officials  of],ocal  Authorities could be nominated for the main committee  atthe discretion of  the body or  association concerned and to  the  sub-committees at the discretion of the main committee.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would  co-operate by  placing  at thedisposal  of  the  committee or sub-committees all the information available in the departments of State to assist  them in their laboursand, in order to facilitate this process, by providing the servicesof  official  secretaries  for  the main committee and the sub-com-mittees.   They  would also if desired provide accommodation for meetings  and defray any  travelling expenses  of  members and thecost of printing and stationery.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government would desire to  add that they regard the matter  as one of grave  importance  and  urgency,  and if,  asthey trust,  they receive  the  co-operation of  the local bodies  andassociations concerned, they  would ask that  the main  committee at all  events should be constituted  and begin work  by the middleof July and that the  work should be  arranged on such lines  that(hey may  be furnished with the views  and  recommendations  ofthe committee by  the end of October, so that they may consider and determine any issues of general policy raised, subject of course,as may be necessary,  to final decision  by  Parliament.                         I am,  Sir,                               Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   N. CHAMBERLAIN.

COMMITTEE ON LOCAL EXPENDITURE  (ENGLAND AND                          WALES).To the Eight Hon. NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, M.P.,    Chancellor of the Exchequer.SIR,  L.  We, the Committee constituted in  response to the invitation ofH.M. Government conveyed in your letter of the 1st July, 1932, tothe London County  Council, and the Associations of Local Autho-liiies, have the honour to submit &quot;our Eeport.                       CHAPTER  I.                     INTRODUCTION.                    1. General Procedure.  J.  In  view of the  important task entrusted to us and the limited time  in  which we were asked to accomplish it,  we resolved  our-sclves at the outset  of our work into six  Sub-Committees dealingwith  Education, Housing, Public Health, Public Assistance, Roadsmid  Bridges and  the  Agricultural  Services.  Under this  arrange-nient we were  enabled to proceed simultaneously with the examina-tion of the various main  groups of  services coming under review.The Sub-Committees called into consultation members and officersof Local Authorities who were specially qualified by knowledge or experience to assist on particular subjects,  and we desire to expressour gratitude to those who so generously responded to our request for their help.  We also wish to express our appreciation of the services of those members of Government  Departments who assisted us by actingis secretaries of the Sub-Committees and in other  ways.  We have received  evidence both oral  and written from a numberif organisations who wished to place suggestions before us.  Wene conscious  of the  help we derived from this  evidence and wedank those who gave it.  3.  We wish to make it clear that while we have  been muchissisted  by those  whom  we called  into  consultation and by thevidence, both  oral and written, submitted to us, the responsibilityor the recommendations contained in this Report is ours and  oursdone.  Moreover, the conclusions at which we have arrived are ouronclusions as  individuals, and should not  be taken as in any  wayommitting the Associations or Authorities  by  whom  we  wereppointed or as necessarily representing their views.  4.  Some of our recommendations are  put forward as measures ofetrenchment rendered necessary by the financial  exigencies of thenesent time.
  Many of them, however, are put forward on  their merits as per-manent measures of economy which can be carried out without detriment to  the services to which  they apply, or with positive advantage both in cost and in efficiency.  To give ellect to a number of  them amending legislation will benecessary.  o. In conducting our enquiries  we have kept in mind that we were required to examine local expenditure as a whole, whether defrayedfrom rates or Exchequer grants, and to make  proposals for reducingthe  total  expenditure  falling  on  public  funds whether local or national.  We have  taken the view therefore that there  was noprofit in  considering  suggestions which had no other object  than  ntransfer of burden  from rates  to taxes and  vice versa.  So  far as was practicable we have reviewed the whole  field of Local government-ment and have examined not  only major issues such as Housing.Education, and  Roads,  but  also the day  to  day administration ofLocal Authorities.  We have not  thought it part of our functions to investigate the trading undertakings of Local  Authorities.  This is  more a  matterof  business organisation  than Local  Government  and we  have regarded it as alien to our enquiries.  6. TVhas been  represented to us that there are some fields  wherefrom the national point of view, for  example the effect on generalemployment,  curtailment of Local Authorities&apos; activities would hethe reverse of true  economy.  We have been  told also that in somedirections, particularly  in connection with  building and  PublicWorks, the repeated calls for reduction  in  public expenditure arebeing regarded as  an argument against expenditure of this kindby  industrial  undertakings and private  individuals.  Considerations of this nature were  outside  the scope of our refer-ence.  We  were appointed  to examine local  expenditure  and toindicate how reductions could be effected.  We have discharged this task to the best of our ability.  We wish,  however,  to  express  the  opinion  that  economy  in national  and  local expenditure, if  it  results as it&apos; should  result.in  reduction of the  burden  of rates and taxes, will not only setmoney  free  for  the  development of trade   and industry,  but  by removing anxiety  lest even greater burdens  should  be imposed,will also stimulate business enterprise and encourage private indi-viduals in wise expenditure.                   2. Nature of the Problem.             (1) EXPENDITURE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.   7.  The following  table shows the total revenue  expenditure  ofLocal Authorities  in England and  Wales on all  services,  excepttrading undertakings,  falling  on rates  and grants  for the years1919-20  to 1929-30,  the last year for which complete figures areat  present available.

Such figures as we have obtained indicate that the expenditure of Local Authorities in  the year  1930-31 was  greater than  in the uovious year.  For  example, the expenditure of County Boroughs inly falling on rates  and grants, was  approximately ii88,000,000compared  with  84,200,000 for the year 1929-30.  Complete details showing the figures attributable  to the  various services in the year 1929-30 are shown in  Appendix I, which is the summary  of the Local Taxation Returns.  8. It will be seen from Appendix I  that the principal heads ofexpenditure falling on rates and grants in the year 1929-30 were as follows : 1.2.3.4.5.6;EducationHighways and  Bridges    ...     ...Public  Health  (including  the  sanitary    services, lunacy and mental deficiency)Relief of the Poor ...Police ...Housing     . 79,685,16648,470,092                                                   42,678,884                                                   31,457,884                                                   20,899,587                                                   13,927,407  9.

(a) Trading  Sere ices.  It  is a  material  consideration that no  less than   422,897,029(36   per cent.) of the total debt of Local Authorities was in  respectof trading services, and is comparable with the capital of statutorycompanies carrying on similar services.  Broadly  speaking  it doesnot involve a charge  on the rates, though in some areas, the  trading services are run at a loss.  This debt  increased  by   129,557,918 in ten years although thecapital expenditure in  that  period amounted to  249,994,020.lb) Housing and Advances for.House purchase.  It  is under this head that the  greatest  capital expenditure hasbeen  incurred,  the  balance  owing in 1930 being 38 per cent, ofthe total debt of Local Authorities.(c) Other  rate fund services.  Tn  the  seven  years ending on  31st March, 1927, the outstandingloan  debt  (gross)  increased by  76,095,265.  The capital expendi-ture  during that period was   176,049,468.  In  the two years  ending  on 31st March, 1930, the capital ex-penditure was  66,194,905 and the increase of net debt  21,175,512.The  balance on 31st March, 1930, was 25   per cent, of the totaldebt.  Under (&quot;),  (b) and  (c) the capital expenditure in the ten years to 31st March, 1930, was   980,586,739 and the increase  in  netdebt  was   662,625,314  (of  which  over  420,000,000 were  for housing).  The  general  position  with  regard to  the  growth  in  LocalAuthorities&apos; debt is dealt with at some length in the Annual Eeportof the Ministry of Health for 1931-2 and we return to  the subjectlater in our Eeport.              (2)  INCREASED  POWERS AND DUTIES.  10.  We have refrained from giving any figures covering the period before the War in Table I above (which relates to revenue expendi-ture), because the circumstances of Local Government have changedso radically since that date that we do not consider that comparisonwould  serve any useful purpose.  One would not be comparing likewith like.  The figures, however, which are given in  the  above tables showa  growth in Local Government expenditure  and in Local Govern-inent  commitments which must call  for very serious thought andindicate that a very heavy burden has been placed on the privatecitizen.
  We recognise that both the Central Government and  the LocalAuthorities  have to bear, responsibility for  what has  taken  place and, if economy is to be effected, it will be necessary not only thatthe Central Government should refrain from placing fresh  burdens on  the country but that the Local Authorities  themselves should review the  whole  field of  their  activities  and  tighten  up their administration.  Since the War there has been a steady stream of legislation givingLocal  Authorities  fresh  powers  and  imposing  fresh duties and obligations upon them.&apos;  There have been Acts, Orders, or Ilegula-tions dealing with Housing, Education, Agriculture, Public Health,Mental Deficiency, Roads, and almost every subject affecting LocalGovernment.  When  a new duty is imposed on or a new function assigned toLocal Authorities by Parliament under the general jurisdiction of aGovernment Department, that Department  is expected  to  giveeffect to  the wishes of Parliament, and  proceeds to persuade andat times  to  apply pressure to the Local Authorities to take action.In this process there is sometimes a tendency to aim at  perfectionand uniformity and inadequate allowance is made  for local needs and circumstances.  We feel strongly that the time  has come when a halt shouldbe called to  legislation involving Local Authorities in fresh expendi-ture.  They  already have more than enough to do in  perfectingtheir organisation  to carry  out the many new  duties assigned tothem in recent years.  Before  expenditure  can be reduced it is  necessary to arrest  itsgrowth, and this, we are satisfied,  is one of the most effective waysto arrest  it.               (3)  Effect of Percentage Grants.  11. The encouragement of increased local expenditure has  been most  marked in those  services  where the  system of percentagegrants prevails, indeed it has been an avowed defence of the system that it does and is  designed  to induce Local Authorities  to develop the services or carry out the  works for which the grants are offered.The operation of the unempkyyinent grants  illustrates the principle in its extreme  form:  It is &quot;not  suggested that  Local  Authorities enter upon recklessexpenditure  merely&apos; because a large  percentage  will be borne bythe  Exchequer, but  they   have  been  encouraged to embark  on expenditure they would otherwise have been willing to postpone bythe consideration that there  are Government grants  available which.if not taken, will go to-someone else.   All members of  Local Government  bodies are familiar  with  the argument frequently adduced in support of certain proposals  that,only half the cost will fall upon the rates and that  the balance will
i)C found by the Exchequer, and we think it is beyond dispute thatm balance the effect of the percentage grant system has been in[lie direction of too great an extension of services with a resultingincrease in expenditure. A  further  consequence of the system  is that Local Authoritiesraise loans for expenditure which might with advantage have beenle frayed from revenue.   This is due to the natural reluctance of theCentral Government  to  increase its demands on  the public purseby meeting its due share of the expenditure in one sum instead ofspreading it  over  a period of  years.  Further  reference  to this ismade in Chapter  VII. 12. We desire to refer specially  to one feature of the percentagenrant system, namely, the control exercised by Government Depart-ments over Local Authorities.  Here  it is  not limited to  generalpolicy  but  extends   to  matters of  lesser  moment  and even  totrivialities. We recognize that the responsible Ministers must be in  a positionto satisfy themselves that Local Authorities are doing their workand  that the money  provided  by the Exchequer is being properlyexpended; and if the  money is being provided on a pound  for poundbasis or in extreme cases on a three pound for one pound basis itmay be argued that the scrutiny must be detailed. However that  may be a substantial  expenditure  of  time andlabour is incurred by Local Authorities in preparing detailed par-ticulars of proposals for submission  to the Government Departments,dealing with demands for information  and statistics or in consulta-tion with reference  to  matters which might  safely  be left to  the discretion of the Local Authorities. Numerous examples of what we have in mind will occur readilyto anyone familiar with local administration, and we  think  there isno doubt that under this system there is duplication of labour involving-ing avoidable cost in  administration and delay in execution of work. 13. A review  of  the  considerations touched  upon in the two preceding paragraphs has led us to the conclusion that the precedentestablished in the Local  Government Act, 1929, should be followed and the principle  of equitable  block grants extended  to as many aspossible of those  services which are at present aided  by percentagegrants.  This would make for economy, would get rid of much  meticulousirritating and wasteful supervision, and  would leave Local Autho-rities free to administer their services in the manner best  suited to the particular needs  of their area and to their financial resources,subject  to  general  review  by  the Central  Departments  of  theefficiency and economy of t\\eiv arrangements.
  We  recognize  that  the  working out of a system  or systemblock grants applicable to  all the different services would be a task of great  complexity and difficulty, impossible of attainment  bvCommittee constituted as we are, with a wide field to cover  and&apos;limited time in  which to cover it.  We  therefore  recommend  that there should be an immediate enquiry into the subject by a body specially appointed for the purpose . 14. So far we have  dealt with the  steps which  could  be  takeiby the Central Government to promote economy.   There is,  however, a wide field  for the reduction  of expenses in more  efficieiiadministration both by the Central Government Departments anby the Local Authorities.  Under the double urge of local enthusiasm  and  pressure  from government Departments  standards  both in capital expendingand  in maintenance have in many cases reached  a level which musbe regarded as beyond the  needs of an efficiently conducted serviceWe have in various places in our Report drawn attention to the w idvariations of expenditure  on comparable  services  administered b\different  Authorities, and we have no doubt that closer administntion  by Local Authorities and a more careful check by the  Government Departments  would  bring about very large  economies  without  in any way impairing the service.   One of the  most potentmeans of securing  more effective  administration lies in the proper use of statistical returns and costing systems.  We have in the hodof the Report drawn  attention to the great value  of  this methodin specific  cases  where it has been wisely applied.   We are, however, not satisfied that sufficient use has been made by the Daparments of the Central  Government  or by  the  Local Authoritiethemselves of the very varied and complete information which Inbeen gathered  together and thrown -into statistical  returns andother forms.  We  suggest  that the returns required  from  Authorities shoube examined with  a view to devising simpler forms which  wouldbe sufficient to throw up points of major importance in administration  which required attention, and particularly that the  figures should be such that Authorities may compare their own results withthose of  other Authorities  and be  encouraged to  make enquiry intothe reasons for unusually wide variations.  With  certain  conspicuous exceptions, it does not seem to havbeen the regular practice  of  Central  Departments to base  uponconsideration of  these statistics any  systematic enquiry into themethods  of administration  of different Authorities.  We  regard itas a  most  important function of Central  Departments that  wherewide differences  are found in the  cost of what would  appear  to becomparable services, definite action should be taken to discover thereason for  these  variations,  and to assist  Local Authorities  whose
jxpeiiditure is high to reduce that expenditure by closer administra-lioii, and by adopting tho practice which has been  found successfuljud economical by other Authorities.                 3. Arrangement of Report.  la. In the remainder of our Report we  set out our conclusionsunder the following main Heads :--   Chapter II      ...    ...     Education.   Chapter III      ......     Housing.   Chapter IV      ...    ...     roads and  Bridges   Chapter V       ......     Public Health.   Chapter VI     ...    ...     Public Assistance.   Chapter VII     ...    ...     General   Organisation    and                                   Financial Administration.   Chapter VIII    ......     Agricultural Services.   Chapter IX     ...    ...     Miscellaneous.   Chapter X       ...    ...     Summary   of    Recommenda-                                   tions and Conclusions.  In a  few instances  we have  referred  to  the  same subject inlillerent chapters.  We have  done this because we thought ii  was more convenient to treat each service  or  group of services so faras possible as a self contained whole within the limits of  a singlechapter. In Chapter  VII we  discuss the difficult question of  salaries  and wages of  Local Government employees  (including  Teachers  and police). In Chapter VIII we review the Agricultural Services undertaken by Local  Authorities.   These services  are  ancillary to one of thegreatest and most vital of our national industries and are in a some-irhat different category from the other functions of Local Authorities. In Chapter  IX  we refer to some  items of Police Expenditure.The cost of the Police Services is considerable, but the major element in it is the cost of Police Pay which has already been dealt with inthe Report of  the May  Committee on National Expenditure (Cmd.39-20, issued in July, 1931), and, as  stated above,  is referred to in chapter VII of our Report. A  Select  Committee  of the House of Commons  has already re-ported on the  question of the  abolition of the  smaller Police Forces-a matter  to which we might otherwise have desired  to pay someattention and there is little left that we wish to say. In the remainder of  Chapter IX we refer to a number  of othermatters which, though small in themselves, in the aggregate account for a substantial amount of  expenditure.  To  say  that the  indi-vidual sum is small is no good reason for continuing an unnecessaryexpense, and  the  prevalence of such an  attitude  is  one of the elements that  has brought local expenditure to its present level.
  16. It was  intimated to us that the Government regarded  outenquiry as one of grave and immediate urgency and  we were askedto present our conclusions by the end of October.  It has therefore been necessary for us in some cases to confine ourselves to indicatinnpoints where our  survey has suggested that detailed investigation is necessary.  While we believe that we have  reviewed all the major branchesof expenditure, there will be minor sources of expense to which wchave  not made reference some matters of administration,  othersstatutory requirements now no longer appropriate and we suggestthat both the  Local Authorities  and  the  Government departments should persevere in a search for  further savings.  The need for economy has already been recognized  and apart fromthe savings secured  by Government  action substantial reductionshave  been  secured  by the  Local Authorities.   To  some extent,  therefore,  this  Report represents  a  secondscrutiny of a field in which the simplest and most obvious economieshave  already been made.  17. We have thought it  right wherever practicable to  give esti-mates of the savings to be anticipated from our  recommendations.In some instances it has been possible to estimate the  saving with reasonable precision.  In others the  position has been more diffi-cult and we have  had to give  the best estimate we  could makewith  the information at our disposal.  Where  this course has  hadto be adopted we believe  that our figures are  on the conservativeside.   In others again we have been  unable to give any  figures atall, though satisfied  that there are large savings to be made.  Most of our recommendations are progressive  in  effect and  willrequire varying periods before  they  can become fully  operative.Much also will depend on the  attitude  of  the Local  Authorities.Without their  co-operation many  of our recommendations  will befruitless and it is only with  good  will and  determination on then-part that the full savings which we anticipate can be achieved.   Given a reasonable measure of good will  we believe that  within three  years  the  measures  we recommend,  together  with  the economies which have already been effected by the Government andthe Local Authorities,  would enable Local  Expenditure falling onrates and grants to  be reduced by from 35 to 40  million  poundsbelow the  expenditure for  the year  1929/30.  With  really determined  efforts and  intensive scrutiny  of  all expenditure we consider that the  figure of saving  might be sub-stantially higher.
                      CHAPTER  II.                      EDUCATION.                      1. Introductory.  IS. We think it well to preface this Chapter by repeating withreference to the Education Service what we say in paragraph 4 ofthe opening Chapter,  namely, that &quot; some of our recommendations are put forward as measures of  retrenchment rendered necessaryIn  the financial exigencies of the present time.  Many of them,however, are put forward on their merits as  permanent measuresof economy which  can be carried out without  detriment to theservices to which they apply,  or with positive advantage both in costand  efficiency.&quot; 10. In this Chapter we do  not deal with Teachers&apos; salaries.  Webiive considered them as part of  the general review of all  salariesslid  wages  which we  make in Chapter VII and we submit recom-mendations  with regard to them in that Chapter.  20. Some explanation should  perhaps be  given regarding theestimates of the economies to be obtained as a result of the various recommendations.   In  some cases,  such  as staffing  reduction,where the extent of the action to be taken can be controlled easilybotli by Local  Education  Authorities and by the Board of Educa-tion, there  is little difficulty in forming a fairly accurate estimate ofthe amount of  saving to  be expected.  In other  cases, however,such as the revision  of arrangements  for maintenance  allowances and  an increase in fees, proposals must, in the first instance, comefrom the Local Authorities, and much  depends on how far they areprepared to carry out the recommendations we have made.   In such circumstances precise estimates are out of the question,  and  wehave had to be satisfied with figures which we consider are  possible of realisation,  given  a reasonable measure of agreement amongLocal Education Authorities  to follow  our recommendations.  To a number of recommendations we have not found  it practicable to attach any estimate of savings whatever a point  of particular importance  with regard to Special Services.   On this  subject someof the figures we have been  able to  obtain are not entirely reliablefor comparative purposes, and the  whole question is so technical[hat we have  not  found  it  possible to do  more  than recommendlocal and central enquiries into  the different  problems which  ourpreliminary investigations have brought  to light.   In the part ofthis Chapter which treats of Special  Services, therefore, we Lavebeen able  to insert only one  definite figure of estimated saving,and that on a comparatively minor item ; but this does not  imply that we think  that  this  is  the  only  reduction  obtainable in  theexpenditure on these  Services.   On the contrary, we believe thatthorough  enquiries  such as we recommend, and  especially an
 enquiry on the costing side, will certainly result in greater efficiency from existing expenditure,  and will also be the means of reducinn expenditure without impairing the services rendered.   21. Partly in response  to  the general appeal for economy issued in  September of last  year, and  partly  because reductions were forced upon  Authorities as a result of the revision of the Board&apos;s grant formula and the consequent reduction in the  grant  received by them from the Exchequer, Authorities have already effected very considerable  economies, and in many  cases have taken measures to make such reductions as can be secured immediately.   The cut in teachers&apos; salaries has resulted in an aggregate savino of over  5,000,000 per annum.   In addition,  although  the Local Education Authorities were contractually committed to heavy capital expenditure  on  new  buildings before  the call  for  retrenchment came, their expenditure on other items has also been substantially reduced, this expenditure in the case of elementary education beino  21,030,000  in  1932-33   (estimated)   as  against  21,790,000  in 1931-32  (estimated), while  a corresponding fall is  shown in ex- penditure on Higher  Education.    Measures have  already  been taken, therefore, to reduce expenditure on  education  by  about  6,000,000.   In this  Report we  make certain  recommendations which  are estimated  to  bring about  a further  reduction  of  approximately  3,160,000.  To the remainder  of our recommendations we  have not  felt  able  to  assign detailed  estimates  of savings.  They  will, however, be  considerable and we are reasonably confident that in the aggregate they would ultimately amount to at least  500,000. Further,  the  proposals  of the  Board  of  Education  regarding Secondary Education  are expected to reduce net expenditure  by about  400,000.    The cumulative effect of the measures already taken and those recommended in this  Chapter will, therefore, be to reduce expenditure  ultimately by rather more than   10,000,000 per annum as compared  with the period up to last  Autumn.   In Chapter  VII we make recommendations with regard to Teachers&apos; increments, which if carried into effect would result in  an annual saving of  235,000 in  the first year, increasing ultimately to  about  2,250,000 per annum.  We consider that the  total of all these reductions is as large as can reasonably be expected.   Regard should be  had  to  the economies already achieved when considering the extent of the further measures which we propose.                   2. Elementary Education.                   (1) CLOSUEE  OF SCHOOLS.  22. One of  the most obvious means of effecting economy  is  bythe closure of small schools, both  provided  and non-provided, andthe transfer  of the  children elsewhere,  in cases where  sufficientaccommodation is available and distance does not render the transfer                                       \
loo difficult.   Instances where this could be done are by no meansinfrequent, and experience leads us to believe that very substantial economies are possible in this direction.  What we have in mind is the case of the village with two schoolsside by side, each with a large proportion of empty places, and eachloo small  to be anything but costly to maintain, and incapable ofattaining reasonable efficiency except by a disproportionate expendi-ture; or the  group of town schools with a good  margin of spareaccommodation, where it would be quite possible to close one ormore schools and distribute the children  over the others, obtainingsome reduction in staff as well  as saving the whole cost of upkeepof the premises of the closed schools.   Instances which have cometo our notice are, for example :       (a) A small village with two schools, one having 35 children,    the other  55.   The accommodation in one of the schools would    be quite  sufficient for  all the children.  One school could be    closed, saving .- 250 a year.      (o) A school with 80 children, only one  mile distant from a    large  school with ample accommodation.   The  closure of the    smaller school would reduce maintenance costs by  400 a year.      (c)  A village school  with 84 children could be closed,  and    the children  transfeiTed to neighbouring schools, saving  650    a year.      (d) In  a town with a population of about 250,000 it is esti-    mated that the closure  of five small schools and  the redistribution-    tion of the children among neighbouring  schools would save     4,600 a  year.  The reason  why nothing  has  been done in cases such  as these isthat, under Section 19 of the Education Act, 1921, if a  school has30 children or over  in average attendance,  the school  cannot be declared unnecessary  by the Board of Education (and hence cannotbe closed)  if the closure is  disputed.  The effect of  this is that innil except the smallest schools any  interested persons can vetoclosure.  In the  instance  mentioned in (c)  above, where the  school  is aprovided school,  closure  was proposed by the Authority but the parents objected, and since  there was a &quot; dispute,&quot; the  Board wereprecluded by the Education Act from declaring the school unneces-sary.  In other cases where a non-provided school would be closedthe objection  comes  from  the  Managers, who, although religiousinstruction is given-  in all  elementary schools, consider  that the religious instruction  given in their own  school in accordance withthe tenets of their  own denomination  is the vital, part of thesehool&apos;s curriculum.   Under the &quot; Conscience Clause &quot;  (which is contained in  Section 27  (1) (a) of  the Education  Act, 1921) nochild can be  compelled to  attend religious instruction  given in aprovided or non-provided Public Elementary School; and under theAnson Byelaw, which operates  already in many areas, and could be
 operated in all, children can by special arrangement be withdraw, at agreed times from a school to receive religious instruction of t^l kind desired  by the  parents.  These arrangements, however, aril mot  sufficient  to overcome the opposition of those bodies of Manage,;! who attach great importance to their right  to appoint teachers 0jl their own religious persuasion.   23.  If regard were had  solely to  economy and efficiency in thjl giving of secular  instruction a very large number of schools eouI,jl be closed.  The figures given above show what  could be accoii;. plished  in single  instances.    We have  been furnished also  with estimates of what can he done  over large areas :  in one large tits an annual saving of  8,100 could be effected  in this  way, while one rural  county  would  save to  the extent  of  4,000 or  5,000, and another larger and more densely populated county area would save  50,000 a year merely by closure  of  redundant schools.   If full freedom of action could be used throughout the country as  a whole on the Ikies indicated above (due regard being given&apos;to the fact that infants  and young  children  could not  be expected to travel  very far  to  school),  we  consider  that  total  economies of the order of  1,000,000 per annum could be achieved.   It is recommended therefore that Section 19 of the Education Act be repealed, and provision  made under which Authorities may sub- mit  proposals to  the  Board for the better organisation of their elementary school system designed to effect greater educational effi. ciency or financial economy or both, even though such reorganisa- tion may involve the closure of existing schools.            (2) Amalgamation of Small Departments.   24.  Out of 30,303 Public Elementary  School  Departments in England and  Wales there  were on 31st March, 1931,  over 11,00(1 Departments  with 100 children or  less in average attendance over 11,000 units,  that  is  to  say, which  are  so small as necessarily to involve  waste in  both  teaching power  and other  costs of main- tenance.  Many even of the larger departments must also  (unless they have a very short age-range)  be classed as uneconomic.   Most  of these Departments  are admittedly in  rural areas, and some are in fact all-age  schools whose small  size is the  inevitable result  of sparse population.  Others, however, are merely  distinct parts of the one  school, which could be amalgamated under the supervision of one head in order to  secure a larger unit, with a more economical  distribution of staff and a reduction in maintenance costs.   We recommend that in rural  areas Local Education Authorities should survey their small Departments with the object of obtainingeconomies through amalgamation wherever possible.   In populous urban areas we recommend (without prejudice to the amalgamation of larger departments wherever practicable) that Departments (i.e., parts of a larger school) with 150 children or less  should  not be
permitted to continue a separate existence, unless the circumstances are exceptional, or it can be shown that amalgamation would resultin no appreciable economy.  By  this means it should be  possible  to reduce expenditure byabout  25,000 per annum.               (3)  REDUCTION OF  SCHOOL STAFFS.  25.  On  31st March,  1931,  there were 108,934 teachers of allkinds  in regular employment in  Public Elementary Schools  inEngland and Wales, giving on the  average 29.2 children in averageattendance to every teacher.   (The  number of  teachers includesSpecialists such  as  Handicraft and.Domestic  Subjects instructorsand also Head Teachers not in charge of a class, so that the averagesize of classes was higher  than 29.2; the number of pupils per classteacher was, in fact, 32.3  children in  average attendance, while theaverage  number on  roll per teacher was, of course, highei-).  The ratio of pupils to teachers necessarily varies according to thecircumstances of  each  area,  being as a rule  lowest  in sparsely populated counties and highest in the areas of  densest population:In 1930-31, the number of pupils per teacher (excluding  specialistsand head teachers not in  charge of a class) for  different types of areas in  England and Wales was :       Counties  (excluding London),  28.9  children  in  average    attendance.      Boroughs  and Urban  Districts,  34.1  children in  average    attendance.      County Boroughs, 35.6 children in average attendance.      London, 34.5 children in average attendance.  We consider that it should be possible to increase  these ratiosand therefore recommend that scrutinies of staffing should be under-taken  with  a view  to  raising the above ratios  to  the  following figures :       Counties, 30 children in average attendance per teacher.      Boroughs,  Urban Districts,  County Boroughs and London,        36.5 children in average attendance per teacher.  The effect of this recommendation should be to reduce teachingstaffs  over the Country by about 5,500 posts for  class teachers.  Although we do not suggest that these ratios  should be  appliedrigidly to individual Authorities, far  less to  individual schools, we hope that a greater measure  of  uniformity than exists at  presentwill be achieved, since the differences in relative staffing strengthbetween areas are now unduly great.  In addition, we  recommend  that  unless the circumstances areexceptional,   200  children in average  attendance  should  be  theminimum size of department in which the head teacher is free  fromfull-time charge  of  a class.  The effect of this recommendation
should be to reduce further the number of assistant teachers by ,further 2,000  at  least, making  a total  reduction in elementaryteaching staffs of  7,500 posts, and a total  reduction in annual c0,:iof teachers&apos; salaries of about  1,500,000.   26.  In order to minimise hardship  to students  who  enteredtraining  colleges in 1929  and  1930,  when the  Government were pressing  the college authorities to increase numbers in view of the government&apos;s expressed intention of i-aising the school leaving age.we recommend that  this  reduction  should  be effected  in  three stages, establishments  being reduced in 1933-34 by 2,500 posts, in1934-35 by a further 2,500  and the full reduction being obtained in1935-36.   The amount of wastage  in public elementary school staffs (i.e.,the number of teachers leaving the service owing to  their havin&quot;reached  the age limit or owing to ill health or on marriage or forother  reasons) is  between  9,000  and 10,000  every year.  If  thereduction we propose is carried out in three stages, it  should not benecessary to dismiss any teachers  in service, although  the difficultyof absorbing  the  trained  teachers  leaving the  training  collegeswill be increased.   27.  The  greatest  difficulty7  in  effecting a  reduction  in  staffobviously occurs in the  smaller schools,  for  example,  in  schoolswhich have scarcely sufficient children to justify four teachers, but have  more  than can be managed efficiently  by three.  The onlysolution  of  this problem seems to lie  in the grouping  of  schools and reallocation of children among them for the purpose of staffingreduction; e.g. if school &quot; A &quot; and school &quot; B &quot; are both in theposition   suggested above  (i.e.  slightly  over-staffed  with   fourteachers but  substantially  under-staffed with  three  teachers each)the only possibility is  to reduce the staff of,  say,  school &quot; B &quot; byone teacher, and then transfer some of the children to school &quot; A &quot;.so as  to keep the  balance between  the  number  of children  andstaffing power approximately the same in the  two schools.   It is clear that  in order to reduce staffs without  undue detriment to the education of the children it will be necessary for Authoritiesto effect transfers of children from school to school in many cases,and  it will  be impossible for them to secure the  most economicalstaffing  unless they have complete control over the distribution ofchildren among all the schools in their  area.   We would therefore suggest.that  at  this time,  when owing tothe  need for economy it  is essential  that every unit  of  staffingpower should be utilised to the utmost, legislation  should be under-taken to give Local Education Authorities power to give directions to the managers of all schools, provided and non-provided, l-egardingthe admission  of children to their schools.
0 4  Atj i  y               (4)  FEES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.  28. It has been  suggested  that a simple  way  of raising a suh- siantial revenue towards the cost of elementary education would be ihe charging of a small fee.  If, say, every child paid  1 a year (or approximately Gd. for every school week) the total income from elementary school fees  would be nearly  5,000,000.  A charge of this kind,  however, we consider would  be  impracticable  without some form of exemption for  incomes  below a  certain limit  (since attendance at  school  is compulsory)  and  would involve a sub- -iaiitin.1 addition  to the work of Local  Authorities, chiefly in the form  of enquiries into incomes,  which would  have to be made in respect of a large number of families in each Authority&apos;s area.  A  course   which  might  be  considered,  however,   is  the charging of  a  fee  to those  children  attending  selective central schools whose parents are  in  a  position to pay.  In  these schools the education given  is of a higher standard and more expensive than n a normal senior  school.   Further, there is  no  compulsion on a hild  to attend a selective  school, as an  ordinary school is always available as  an alternative.  For those reasons  a fee might  be vquired  of those children  who  are qualified  and who choose to 11tend a selective  senior  school.  For  this,  however, legislation epealing Section 37  (1)  of  the Education Act,  1921,  would  be necessary, in order to enable Local Education Authorities to charge i fee, if they so desire.  It is difficult  to estimate  what would be the income  to be derived from a measure of this kind, since everything woidd depend on the ee and on  the income scale adopted.   If the fee were 10s.  a  term, action on  such lines by  those Local Education Authorities  which live selective central schools  might produce an annual revenue of bout  30.000.        (5) RAISING OF THE AGE OF ENTRY TO SIX YEARS.  29. We  have  considered a  proposal that  the lower  age  of ompulsory school attendance should  be raised from  5 to 6, the noposal being framed on the assumption that if  children between &quot;) and 6 years of  age  were not compelled by law  to attend school, 50 to 75 per cent, would not seek admission.  In  the first  place  we consider that  the  assumption  regardingattendance  is  ill-founded.   The tradition of  attendance  at schoolfrom the age  of 5 upwards  has now become firmly established, andthus,  if there were  not compulsion by  law, we are certain  that  all except a negligible  percentage of children  would begin to attendschool as soon as they reached the age  of 5.  It is to be noted thatone County Education Authority has  in fact taken advantage ofSection 46  (4) (c)^of the Education Act, 1921, to raise the  lowerlimit of attendance  to 6, and  that this step has had little effect  on school  attendance.     On  31st  March,  1927,  before  the  byelaw
raising  the age was put into operation,   the  number of children under 0 years in Public Elementary  Schools  in  the County  was1,261, while on the 31st March, 1931, after the byelaw had been inoperation for  over three years, the number of &quot; Under 6&apos;s &quot;  was1,030, and a good part, if not all, of the difference can be attributed to a fall in the birth rate.      We do not believe that there would be  any appreciable fallin the number of children attending school if the compulsory ageolattendance  were 6 years to 14 instead of 5  to 14 as at present.Economy could only be achieved by  forbidding children to attendschool before the age of 6, and such a measure we consider open tograve objection for the following reasons :       (a) In  urban  areas where the mothers go out  to work hard-    ship  would  be  caused  by refusing to allow  the children to    attend  school until the age of 6, or  if  some  alternative  pro-    vision were made (e.g.,  in creches) the saving would be greath    diminished.      (b) The taking  of children into school at  the age  of  5 i,    desirable  on national  grounds of health  and welfare.   In a    town almost the only place for  children not in  schools is the    streets,  which  under  modern  conditions  are  dangerous to    children by reason  of the traffic.      Further it is  already clear that between the age of 2, when    a child passes  out of  the care  of  the  Maternity  and Child    Welfare Service, and the age of 5, when he first comes under    the care  of  the School  Medical  Service, there  is a  marked    deterioration in  the health of  the child population,  due partU    to mismanagement on  the part  of the parents,  and partly to    adverse conditions of  living,  such as  bad housing, etc.  The    recovery of the ground lost in this gap of three years is the first    task of the  School Medical Service,  and to increase the gap    would only aggravate the deterioration and make the task of    the School Medical Service more  difficult.      (c) Besides the need for keeping the school  age at 5 on the    grounds of the  children&apos;s health,  there  must  be taken  into    account the valuable social work  done during the first year of    school life.   The child in that year receives a training in good    habits and speech and generally in conduct necessary to enable    members  of a  community  to  work smoothly  together. If    instead of being trained in school during that  year he were    left to run loose in the  streets, he would not only be without    the benefit of the  training, but would instead  be undergoing    still further  the process which may  be  described   as social    deterioration, which undoubtedly  does accompany the physical    deterioration between  the ages of 2 and 5 to  which  we have    already referred.  When eventually he did attend at the age
    of six, the task of the infant school would have been rendered    more  difficult than it now is, firstly because the deterioration    would have gone  further and would have taken a  firmer hold,    secondly  because  the  time available  for the work  would  be    curtailed by a year.  We consider that  the expenditure on  the  training  given  to liildren between the  ages  of  5  and 6 is money well spent and ustified  by its  effects.  We desire  most strongly to urge that the liscontinuance  of this work is highly  undesirable  on grounds  of mtional health and welfare ; and that if further economies must  be obtained, means ought to  be found  for  doing so with less injury to the community.                   3. Secondary  Education.                   (1) CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS.  30.  Of the Secondary Schools in  England aud  Wales aided from mblic funds in  1931,  no less  than 80 had less  than 100  pupils, chile another 151 schools had  100 or over  but less than 150  pupils. chools  of  this size are not economic  units,   inasmuch  as the linimum staff required to give a reasonably good  course of instruc- lion is, when compared with the staff in schook  of moderate  size, eriously  disproportionate to the number of pupils; and   if the linimum  staff is not  supplied, there will be  grave difficulties  in laintainirig the efficiency of the school.  Further, anything in the nature of advanced work is scarcely  possible except  at an excessivecost, unless the staff is composed of teachers of exceptional  ability and energy.  Some of these small  schools serve  comparatively remote districts,and could not be closed without inflicting hardship on the children,who would have to travel long distances or go to  school as boardersas the only alternatives.   Others,  however, are  situated in com-paratively  populous areas and  could be  closed,  at the expense it istrue of causing a certain amount of inconvenience to the scholars,but to the great benefit of public funds.  In such  cases, even if theLocal  Authority incurred  expenditure in conveying  children  orpaying for travelling facilities for the displaced scholars, they could afford to do so out of the savings in  staffing costs.  The chief obstacle to closure is,  of course, local  opinion, whichnaturally objects to the closure of the local school, as that puts thechildren  in the vicinity  to a certain  amount  of  inconvenience.Opposition on this ground is sometimes strengthened by local pridein an old grammar school with a distinguished tradition behind  it.For this reason it is somewhat difficult for action  to be taken  bythe Local  Authorities.   In this connection it is perhaps significant that of the 231 Secondary  Schools  with less than  150 pupils,  nofewer  than 104 are entirely  controlled  by the  Local EducationAuthorities.               *
  The Committee consider that if any effective action is to he take.in this matter it  will be necessary for  pressure to come from \[.Central Authority to support the Local Authorities in closing sin?and expensive Secondary Schools in spite of local  opposition.  7;Committee  therefore recommend that wherever it  can be sho^that reasonable alternative accommodation can be  arranged,  aithat after taking into account all charges for transport, etc., closmwould  result  in  substantial economies, the Board  of  Educaiio-should take action to induce the closure  of small Secondary  School(i.e., Schools with up to 150 pupils on the roll).                      (2) INCREASE OF FEES.  31. The Board of Education have, since our appointment, as3measure of economy taken action  with regard to the increase ifees  in secondary schools.   The matter has therefore been  remove&apos;from the purview of the committee.                        (3)  FREE PLACES.  32. One of the conditions required to  be fulfilled by a SecondanSchool  in  order  to  obtain  aid  from public funds is that  it  runsaward  each year to  ex-Public Elementary School pupils  free place-to the  extent of at least 25 per cent,  of the previous year&apos;s admis-sions,  and the total award  of free places  may  be, and often is.high as 50 per cent, of the  pi-previous year&apos;s admissions, while in several  areas secondary education is entirely free.  On the  31st March,  1931, out of  411,309  pupils in  secondary schools on the Board&apos;s Grant List, 193,021 pupils paid no fee. ailexcept a small  proportion of these holding free  places under theGrant Regulations.  Section 14 (4)  of the Education  Act,  1921,  lays down the prin-ciple that no children should  be debarred, through inability to payfees, from receiving the benefits of  any form of education  fromwhich  they are capable of  profiting.  The effect  of the free  placeregulations, however, has been much wider than this, and  whatin fact occurs is  that any child who reaches the requisite standardin the  free place  examination obtains a free secondary education.irrespective of the financial circumstances of the parent.  The  con-sequence is that many children are now holding free places although their parents could afford to pay a fee.  There is an  opportunity  here for  increasing  substantially theincome received by way of fees  from parents.   In  this matter also.however, the Board  of Education have themselves  taken action, andwe-do  not  feel  we are called upon to make any recommendation.  33. We  understand that  the Board estimate that, allowing forstricter administration in the award of  maintenance allowances in secondary  Schools  (which  is included  in  our  recommendation in\
 ira graph 43) their proposals for the increase of fees and the revise- ion&quot;of free-place arrangements will reduce the net annual expendi- uiv on the  provision of Secondary Education by about   400,000 livided between the Exchequer and the rates in equal proportions).               (4) REDUCTION OF SCHOOL STAFFS. 3d. We find  that where Local Education  Authorities have  a lelinite ratio of  pupils  to teachers to serve as a basis in calculating ie staff  required for their Secondary Schools the ratio most com- nonly adopted is from 20 to 22  children to each teacher.  In prac- icc, however, the ratio is generally  lower; and over England and Vales as a  whole the  proportion on 31st March,  1931,  was 20.18 wpils to one teacher  (excluding  Heads).   Later figures are not vailable; but it is estimated that on 31st March, 1932, the rate of anils to  teachers was about 20.6.   To increase this ratio is an livious means of seeking economy, and we consider that an increase ion Id be possible. We recommend,  therefore,  that a revision of Secondary School tails should be  undertaken, with  a view to raising  the ratio, and tiggest that the  standard to be attained should be between 21.5 and 2 pupils to  one  assistant teacher.  We do not recommend that this ratio should  be  applied  strictly  to individual  schools,  or even to ndividual Authorities.  In small schools and  in rural districts  it only probably not be attained without gravely impairing efficiency : at in towns and densely populated districts with large  Secondary rhools a ratio substantially higher should be reached without much ifficulty, and over  the Country  as a  whole  an  average rate of ietween 21.5 and 22 should be quite feasible.  For individual schools of average size (i.e., of 300 to 400 pupils)we suggest  as a guide  a  proportion of one  teacher  to every 26pupils, allowing an additional teacher for every 26 pupils  over theage of 16 (an extra  teacher being allowed  if there are 14 or morepupils over  the  exact  multiple  of 26,  but  no  extra teacher being llowed if there  are 13 pupils or less over the exact multiple). 35. The effect of  this recommendation would be to reduce thenumber of teaching posts  by  about 1,000 involving  a reduction instaffing costs in  the  neighbourhood of  300,000 per  annum.   As inthe case of the suggested reduction  in Elementary School  Staffs, andfor a similar reason, we recommend that this  reduction should becarried out over a period of three years. Various expedients,  such as  a reduction in  the number of freeperiods allowed  to teachers, could be adopted  in order to make it easier to  effect  a reduction in staffs.  We would also recommendthat wherever the nature of the buildings  permits classes of morethan 30  children to  be formed, Authorities and Governing Bodies
should-be allowed to increase the size of junior forms up to 83  their own discretion.    At  present  a  class  must  not exceed 31children without the special permission of the Board of Education  The  estimate  of  the  possible reduction  of staffs  takes  int(account  all grant-aided  schools, i.e., direct  grant schools,  1 .r)eaEducation Authority schools and independent schools aided by 1.,,^Education Authorities.  Actually, the number of assistant teachesemployed  in  schools  maintained or aided  by Local EducationAuthorities on  31st March, 1931,  was  16,614 out of a  total a20,393, and  the reduction of staff resulting  from  the applicationof the proposed ratio to these schools would be  about 800 teachersso that the saving to Local Authorities&apos; expenditure would be in&apos;the region of about .- 240,000 per annum.  We recommend,  however.that  a  proportionate  reduction, by  the  application  of the samestaffing ratio,  should be required in the staffs of direct grant schools,or rather that the Board&apos;s capitation grant to those schools shmiljbe modified to  such an extent as to ensure that such  a reduction is made.  We consider  that  at a  time when Local EducationAuthority schools and the foundation and other schools  aided h\Local Education  Authorities are being required, in the interestsolnational economy, to  make considerable sacrifices, it would be tin-just  for the Exchequer payments to direct grant schools to be main-tained at a figure  which did not require any sacrifice from them.            (5) CONCENTRATION OF  ADVANCED  WORK.  36. Our attention has been drawn to the substantial number 0!small classes  at the top of the  school requiring  the full-time alien-tion   of  highly  qualified  teachers  (and therefore  involving greatexpense) which is the result  of many secondary schools endeavour-ing to provide a variety  of advanced work  for their older scholars.and  it  has been   suggested  that considerable  economy  could  beeffected either by removing all  the older pupils and concentratingthem in a few selected  schools, or by  restricting the number of types of advanced work  done in each school.  By either of thesemeans a large  number  of  small classes  could be replaced by a smaller number of large classes.  We have invited opinions  on these suggestions and,  while theremay  be difficulties in the  way, we consider  that  the Board  ofEducation should  require Authorities to take action on  the  lines proposed.  With regard  to  the  direct grant  schools, we  desire  to point outthat, if  the schools maintained or aided by  the Local EducationAuthorities are required for the sake of economy to relinquish some(if not  all)  of their advanced  work and-older  scholars, in equitythe direct-grant schools  should not  be  exempted from the samerestriction.  We are  not able to make an estimate of the  possible savingsunder this head.
9 4 s)  1 O             4. Technical and further Education.         (1)  INCREASE  OF FEES  IN  EVBNING  CLASSES.   7. The fee usually charged for evening  classes is in the neigh- otirhood of two-and-sixpence or  five shillings,  and perhaps in the   ority of cases students  could not  be  asked to pay more.   It  is[undisputed, however, that occasionally classes are attended by cora-Iparatively  well-to-do  students who  could  afford a  substantially[higher payment.  This is true of both vocational and non-vocational lasses.  In the former category  we  have in mind classes such as those in  banking  and  accountancy,  and  in the latter category classes in arts and crafts, etc.  It must, however, be remembered thai even in  the non-vocational group the  classes are often taken by -indents who are far from  being  well-to-do, and whose oppor- timities of fostering cultural interests  are confined to this service.  We are convinced that receipts from fees could be increased with- biifc imposing  any hardships  on students,  if  the classes  for  which fees are raised  are  properly&quot; selected;  and  although we find  it liffiVulfc to lay down any hard  and fast rule regarding the type of lasses in which fees can be  raised, the  examples given  above will show what  we  have in.mind.  In each  case the decision must be [made locally  in the light  of knowledge of  the type of studentsIntending each class.  We therefore confine ourselves to recommending  that  Local[Education Authorities  should  undertake  a  revision of  the  fees[charged  for evening classes having regard  to      (a) the cost to the Authority of providing the class,      (b) the ability of students  to pay.            (2) INCREASE OF FEES IN DAY CLASSES.  38. As secondary school fees are proposed to be raised it is only[reasonable to expect that fees for junior day courses  in technical    commercial schools, art  schools, etc.,  which in a way give aBraining corresponding  to secondary education,  should  be  raised[also.  Arrangements-for the admission  of  free pupils should  alsoJbe revised with a view to securing that  a fee is paid if the parentJean afford it, while in those  schools which at present  are  entirelyfree, a fee should be imposed, in order to bring them into line withIthe others.  In senior courses in technical and other schools giving educationlot&apos;a post secondary type the fees are, as  a rule, considerably higher[than in the case of junior courses; there also, however, we suggest[that the possibility of increasing fees should be considered.  Measures for the raising of fees in day  and evening classes  andfor the  revision  of free entry arrangements should raise the total income  from fees of all kinds for technical and further education,   16766                                                    B
which  in  1929-30 was  402,287, by about  80,000.  If a cone-sponding increase in fees were made in those institutions which are administered by  independent bodies and  aided  by local educationauthorities,  the total  additional  income would be  about   100,UUOper annum. (3) VOLUNTARY BODIES WORKING  UNDER, THE ADULT EDUCATION                          REGULATIONS.  39. The Grants made by the Board of Education  to Bodies carry-ing on Adult  Education  work  have been  reduced to correspond with the  general reduction in teachers&apos;  salaries which took placein October of last year; we understand further that the Board ofEducation have  asked these  Bodies not to make  any increase inthe volume of their work beyond  that carried on in  the  session1931-32.  We  recommend, therefore, that Local Education Authorities alsoshould consider whether a reduction (of say 10 per cent.) could notbe made in their grants-in-aid of these independent organisations.It is within the competence of the voluntary  Bodies to considerwhether they should increase their income  by raising fees.           (4)  CLOSURE OF EVENING CLASSES AT EASTER.  40.  It is a common  experience that attendance at Evening Classesdwindles  rapidly after  Easter for obvious reasons.   We  recom-mend, therefore, that Local  Education Authorities should  requirethe closure of Classes  at Easter, since if this measure were adopted a  substantial reduction in costs could  be obtained.  It  would benecessary to allow exceptions to  a closure rule in the case of Classesfor students who- were working for examinations, and  we would recommend exceptions also in any other circumstances where, for various reasons, appreciable hardship would be inflicted by closureearlier than  is at present the rule.   Ultimately a saving in the neighbourhood of   30,000 per annumcould  be secured  by  this measure, but owing  to  the fact  thaiprospectuses have  been printed and all other arrangements  madeby Local Education Authorities for their Evening Classes for tieSession 1932-3, it would be impossible to put this recommendationinto effect before the Session 1933-4, aud  no  savings will ap]v.;runtil the financial year 1934-5.                   (5) SMALL EVENING CLASSES.   41.  If  they have not already  done so,  Local Education Author:-ties should formulate rules providing for the  amalgamation or closure of Classes where the  numbers in attendance fall below a mininiur. sufficient to justify the expense of maintaining the  Class.  Where Authorities  already have  rules  regarding the  size of Classes these should be reviewed, and if necessary more  strictly enforced.\
   (6) REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION OF TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION.  42.  Advanced  technical education requires a highly  specialisedstaff and equipment, yet in any given  area^even the area of thelargest Local Education Authorities the number of students coming forward in each branch of this kind of work is comparatively small.Thus, for example, one County Borough  may  have 15 students inMechanical Engineering and 25 in  Electrical Engineering and willtry to  provide two advanced courses  for 40 students, while its neigh-hour is likewise trying to run advanced Electrical and MechanicalEngineering courses for 15 and 20 students.  Such an instance is an obvious case for co-operation one Authority providing an advancedKlectrical course for 40 students, the other an advanced Mechanicalcourse for 35 students, thus effecting substantial economies in equip-nient  and staffing.  This is  perhaps an unduly simplified example,hut it  illustrates the kind of over-lapping  that occurs in very many parts  of the country.   It is unfortunately true that voluntary co-ordination between Authorities to avoid-this kind of duplication and consequent  waste of effort is somewhat infrequent, although thereare some conspicuous exceptions to this statement,  such as the York-shire  Council for Further Education, which embraces  the  whole area of  the  three  Ridings and  covers  all forms  of  technical  andadult education within that  area.  The Committee consider  that if any  effective  action is to betaken  to eliminate over-lapping  it must be initiated at the centre,and accordingly we recommend  that steps should be taken by theBoard  of Education  to  encourage Local  Education  Authoritiesto co-operate for  the  more  economical  use of  their  respective re-sources in the giving of technical instruction.  Much  could be done if H.M. Inspectors were instructed  to urge the need of co-operation in appropriate quarters and  we also suggest that the Board should issue  a circular to Local Education Authorities  on this subject,pointing out that  lack of co-ordination involves waste and duplication-tion at one  point  while  leaving unfilled  serious gaps  elsewhere,and inviting Authorities to confer in order, e.g., to set up RegionalCouncils on the Yorkshire model, or to take such other measures as may suit the circumstances of the different areas.  A greater  measure of co-ordination and  co-operation  in  theprovision of  technical education is  essential  if  waste  is  to  be eliminated.                     5. Aid to Students.                (1) MAINTENANCE  ALLOWANCES.  -13.  In  1930-31  the  amount  of  assistance  given  by  LocalEducation Authorities to pupils  in Secondary  Schools by way ofmaintenance allowances was  617,838, and to pupils of approxi-mately Secondary  School  age in Art Schools,  Technical Schools,etc., was  84,472-in all  over   700,000.   The scales used  by  10766                                                   B 2
different  Authorities  for  estimating  the amount  of  assistancerequired in individual cases vary considerably, and the differences in circumstances  between areas do not suffice to explain the widevariations.  We consider that all Authorities should undertake a thorough revision of their scales for the assessment of  need, andWe believe that a considerable tightening up of  the  Regulation;will be the result.  It is to be remembered that standards of needfixed two  or three years ago are  no longer  applicable,  owing  tothe rapid fall which has occurred in the cost of living.   Many Authorities have already revised their scales,  but not all;and we doubt if  even where  revision has been undertaken it ha;always been as far-reaching as circumstances warrant.  A greaterdegree  of  uniformity in scales throughout the country would bedesirable and could be achieved without precluding adjustment  for exceptional local  conditions.(2)  INTENDING TEACHER AWARDS TO PUPILS IN SECONDARY Schools.  44. Owing  to unusually  large  entries when  the raising of theschool-leaving age  was proposed  by the Government, the numberof trained students  now leaving the  Training  Colleges is sub-stantially in  excess of the present needs of  the  schools, and theBoard of Education  are therefore taking  action  to  reduce thenumber of entrants in future years.   Moreover,  the proposals wehave made to reduce the number of teaching posts in  schools will further restrict the  demand for  teachers.   These two factor-render it necessary to restrict  the  present  practice of stimulatin;by special grants the  supply  of young people desiring to enter the teaching  profession.   We  therefore recommend  that  all specialawards made  on the understanding  that the holder should enter tieteaching profession should forthwith be discontinued, at least up  tothe  age when pupils have passed the  School Certificate  Examim-tion; and that, in the awards made to pupils beyond that stage  itSecondary Schools, those given to intending teachers should not be greater in value than those  given  to  other pupils.          (3) LOANS INSTEAD OF GRANTS TO  STUDENTS.  45. Every year substantial sums are disbursed  by Local Educa-tion Authorities by way of  grants  to  students  in  UniversitiesTraining  Colleges,  and other institutions for higher education.  I:the  academic year  1930-31  the total grants awarded to students  itUniversities  amounted to  250,000;  to  students  in  Universii;Training Dejtartments,  81,000;  and to students in ordinary Training  Colleges,  85,000.    The total  amount granted to student-receiving post-secondary education of all kinds was about  500.000
  A number of Authorities have adopted the practice of makingloans rather than grants  to  teachers in  training  and  to   otherstudents, or of providing a certain minimum of aid by way of grant and supplementing this so far as necessary by a loan.  The practiceappears  to have been very successful, as all available informationindicates that  default in repayment is  practically unknown.   Inview of  the uniform success of this practice wherever it has been introduced, we recommend that all  Authorities should consider  thepossibility  of adopting  it.   Further,  we  recommend  that - theyshould consider the possibility  of extending the  practice to cover,besides intending  Teachers, all kinds of University entrants, and,ii:  fact,  students of  all descriptions in  institutions  for   higher education.  Action on these lines to replace grants so far as possible by loanswould not, of course, result in  an immediate reduction in expendi-ture, as savings would only appear as repayments began to be madeby students, and  further,  the  amount  of the ultimate  economiesmust depend entirely on  the  extent to which  this recommendation is put into force  by the Local Education  Authorities.    With  areasonable amount of acceptance by the  Authorities, however, weconsider that a reduction by anything up  to 20 per cent,  should bepossible  on the  500,000 annually  paid  out  by  Local  EducationAuthorities in the form of grants.   In this connection it  should benoted  that  the action which the Board  of Education are  taking(Circular 1420) to effect a reduction in  the number of students inTraining Colleges  and  University  Training  Departments  should result in a corresponding diminution in  the amount of  assistancegranted by Local  Education Authorities to these students.   Underthis head  alone  the  saving  may be  expected  to  amount  to approximately  15,000 per annum.                     6. Special Services.                         (1) GENERAL. 16. In our consideration of the Special  Services  we have beenable  only to raise problems without  being able to go far enough tofind  the answers, and we have not, generally speaking, been in aposition to make recommendations to  which we can attach preciseestimates of savings.   The  most striking fact upon which  we have come in the.course of our inquiries  has been the marked variation in costs as between different areas, which is well illustrated by theattached table showing the unit cost (per child  in average attend-atice) of the various Services.   We think that  an investigation byAuthorities into their expenditure under each head, with a view to ascertaining whether the cost is  justified by the  amount  of work done, will be amply repaid.  16766 &apos;                                                  B 3

In the School Medical Service, to which we have given particular attention,  the  differences  are very difficult to explain, eve:after making allowances for the unreliability of the figures for com-parative purposes, and for the varying stages of development of tLService : for example, there appears to be exceptional variety in tt:speed with which medical and dental inspections are cai-ried out i:different areas, and in the amount of  work performed  in dermsessions.  After careful consideration we have come to  the corelusion that, in view of the  very  striking  figures,  a detailed atfar-reaching enquiry by a Central  Authority into the whole of tfcSchool  Medical Service is  now  required.   Since the Service hbeen in operation for  25 years and hitherto no formal enquiry hbeen undertaken  to review the  progress made,  and  to  determithow far the machinery is working efficiently, an investigation ithis kind  will be  opportune, quite  apart from the present need fieconomy.SPECIAL SERVICES ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. Cost per unit of average attendance, 1931-32.
                               39                                 9 A  p  Tho enquiry  we recommend  should have as  its  object - the determination of how  far  the expenditure  on the  School Medical  ervice is justified by the results obtained,  and keeping this object iii mind  the  investigating  body should  consider whether the total  qjenditure  is  being  wisely  apportioned  between  the different  ranches of the Service,  and also whether value for money is being received in each of these branches.   The points to  which we drawlattention in paragraphs 48  to 51 merit special investigation.  While  the actual enquiry may have to be  conducted by the expertI staff of the Board investigating conditions in the different  areas, we suggest  that  the reports when made should be  referred  to  the  !oard&apos;s Advisory Committee of Local Education Authorities, with  view to their making  recommendations  to  the Board  regarding  ie desirability of any changes.  We have seen enough in the figures we have obtained  to feel[certain that the investigation will have the effect of obtaining betterJservice from  the existing expenditure,  and it  may  be also  that an[actual  reduction  in expenditure  could  be obtained without  any[impairment of the service, and merely as  a consequence of  more[efficient working.                 (2) SCHOOL MEDICAL  SERVICE.I&apos;a)  Cost of Medical Inspection.  IS.  We have  endeavoured  to collect  statistics showing the unit ost (in Medical Officers&apos; salaries) of medical inspection in  various Ureas, but we are not satisfied that the figures we have obtained  e  really  comparable;  nevertheless,  the  variety  shown  in the [figures, ranging from 5d. to Is. lid.  per  inspection, is very striking,(and the  figures showing  the varied number of  inspections per ession are equally remarkable.  We put forward these striking variations as a subject for imme-Idiate  enquiry : we recommend, however,  in the  meantime that[iiecial inspections  (and  treatment) should not  be limited  to theItiuie of the School session. I&apos;b)  Dental Work.  49.  Investigation into statistics of the average  number of in- Ispections and treatments per session carried out by School Dentists  various areas has revealed discrepancies  as  remarkable as those own under Medical  Inspection; and  in the case  of  the  Dental Service the figures appear  to be  more  reliable.   We find that in County areas the number  of children inspected per session varies fin the instances we have  examined) between 50.8 and 89.7, and in urban areas from 35.8  to 200.1.   The number of children  treated per  session varies  similarly,  ranging in County  areas from 2.8 to 0.9, and in urban areas from 2.7 to 14.0; further,  our figures do   16768                                                    B 4
not suggest that a low  figure of children  treated per session catbe explained by an unusual amount of work done on each treat.ment.  These figures obviously call also for immediate investigation  We  would suggest  for  consideration at tho same time  that itwould be well to have drawn up for the guidance of School Dentist:a schedule indicating in some detail what points should be looked to in dental inspections ; and a  schedule should also be drawn Upindicating in detail the  different lines of treatment that should beadopted in different circumstances.  Some measure of this  kind isnecessary to ensure some uniformity of practice  among Dentists.and  to ensure  that expensive  methods  are  not  adopted  unlessnecessary.(c)  Medical Inspection in  Secondary Schools.  50. The practice which obtains  in some areas (and which  is jraccordance with the requirements of the Board) of inspecting ever,child in a secondary school  once  every  year,  while  elementarichildren  are inspected only once  in three  years  on the average,seems to us to be unnecessary.  We recommend that in secondanschools  there should be only one  routine inspection.   Special in&apos;spections should remain as at present.(d)  Tonsils  and Adenoids Operations.  51. In the course of our investigations we  have been impress^by  the  great differences between  Authorities with  regard to thenumber of operations  carried out in proportion to the Public Ele-mentary School population  of the respective areas.   Under tbearrangements made by  one particular  Local  Education Authorit;(which is not unique in  this respect) the number of operations per-formed has  for some years been 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, of theaverage attendance which means that of all  children leaving PubliiElementary Schools in this  Authority&apos;s  area about 40  per centwill have been operated on,  when account is taken of operation-performed under arrangements other than the Authority&apos;s.  other authorities  register only .4 per cent., 1  per  cent, or 2 per cent of operations.  It is difficult to  believe that these discrepancies are due merel;to differences in the incidence of disease and  there seems to usbe &apos; reason  to think that in some areas recourse is  being had tosurgical treatment  with unnecessary frequency.   Since the cost can  operation may  be anything  up to 2 guineas  this is a seriously-matter financially.  We  understand  also  that the trend of medical opinion  is not definitely in favour of  conservative treatment rather than operation, in cases  where there is no apparent ill health caused by th;condition, and  we therefore  suggest that instances in which a pro-portion of  operations above  the  average  is  performed  under  at
Authority&apos;s scheme should be investigated by the Board of Educa-tion, to ascertain whether the unusual rate is justified by unusualincidence of disease.  The number of operations performed in 1931 under arrangementsmade by Local Education Authorities in  England and Wales repre-sented 1.7 per cent,  of the  average  attendance; if this proportionwere reduced to 1.5 per cent, the annual saving  would be approxi-mately  15,000.  The Board of  Education  have aheady begun  to investigate  theirreat differences  in charges  made by hospitals to Local EducationAuthorities for tonsil and  adenoid  operations :  we  are informedthat some hospitals charge different fees  to different Authorities forthe same services a matter which we consider  is certainly worthinvestigation.                     (3) SPECIAL SCHOOLS.lai Deaf and Blind Residential Schools.  52. We  understand that  the incidence  of deafness and blind-oess among children has been falling steadily of recent years.  this seems  to be  the explanation of the comparatively large number ofvacant places in the residential schools for blind  and  deaf children.On 31st March, 1932, the total accommodation in residential schools for the blind was 1,924 places and  the  number of vacancies 299,or if  Local  Education Authority  and ordinary  voluntary schoolsonly are  taken into account, the accommodation was 1,650 placesami the  number of  vacancies  211.  In residential  schools  for deaf  children the situation is some-ivhat similar, the total accommodation on 31st March,  1932, being2,731 places and the number of vacancies  561 (or 2,291 places in local Education  Authority and ordinary voluntary schools of which579 places were  unoccupied).  There  appears  to be an opportunity here for the closure of somexhools in order to redistribute the children in them and make fullise of  the  accommodation in the remaining  schools,  which should result^ in  a reduction in the  present cost  of maintenance.   Atrresent the fee paid  by a Local Education  Authority  for  a  blindiild maintained in an ordinary voluntary institution is about  72ivear; and  the cost for  a deaf child is  about the same figure.  We  suggest that the Board  should look  into the possibility  of closure with a view  to obtaining  some  reduction  in average  costKr head. lb) Mental. Deficiency Schools.  53. While  the  cost  of educating  a  normal  child in  a  public elementary  school  is   12  12s.  a year, the cost  of educating  a mentally defective child in a day special school is about  23 a year, md in a  residential school is much higher,  being about  60 to  70 syear.
  The standard of certification is  based oil the words of Section55  (1) (a) of the Education Act, 1921, which defines  a mentallydeficient child as a child who, not being imbecile and not beiii&quot;merely dull or backward, is &quot;by reason of mental defect incapable of receiving proper benefit from the instruction  in  the ordinanpublic elementary  schools, but is not incapable by reason of thatdefect of  receiving benefit  from instruction in  such special classesor  schools  as  under this  part  of  this  Act may  be  provided fordefective  children.&quot;  A new  factor,  however,  which has appeared  within the  last fewyears and requires now to  be taken into account is the reorganise.tion of elementary schools.   Reorganisation  has been  carried outon  a large  scale since  the issue of the Hadow Report, with theresult that  there are now, in urban areas, a considerable numberof  schools providing short courses  of three years or so for  lar^eaggregations  of  pupils : this is especially so  in  the  new  seniorschools.   In these schools different courses can be, and are,  provide;for children of the same  age but  of different capacities,  and inconsequence  the  arrangements  for the  education   of very dullchildren are much better than they  were a few years ago, before theHadow Report was  published.   In view of  this  we suggest ths:certifying medical officers,  in interpreting the words of the Ac-should bear in mind  the provision now made in the  reorganise:schools for  lower  grade children.   Were this done we believe thaia number of the  children  at  present sent to special  schools  couldbe  taken, in the towns at least, into the lowest grade  classes of the reorganised schools, and that the number of children being educatedin  the substantially   more  expensive  special  schools  would bereduced.  This recommendation applies mainly to London and  some of thelarger county  boroughs, where  the existing provision for  mentallydefective  children in special schools is fairly extensive.  In the res;of  the country the amount  of  accommodation available for thosechildren  who, even when full  use is made  of  the  facilities itreorganised  schools, cannot  profit fully  from public elementaryschool training, is perhaps less than is  necessary for the numbers.and it might be desirable  in  normal circumstances to increase theprovision.  The  present time, however, when expenditure on theeducation of normal children is being  severely  curtailed,  is nsopportune for an  increase  on  the already heavy expenditure on ;!:;education of  mentally  defective children, and we  regret, therefore that in present financial circumstances we must recommend the;further development in this direction be postponed.                        (4) MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Recovery of  Cost of Treatment and  Meals.   54. It  is the statutory duty of every  Local Education Authorityproviding treatment to recover the cost, or part of the cost, fronparents wherever  possible.  (Section 81 (1) of the Education Ad
                              43                                  9 i O1921.)  It seems obvious, however, that Authorities differ in inter-preting this  duty  or in  the vigour of their efforts to  carry  it out.We find, for example, that of two cities in  not  dissimilar circum-stances one recovers nearly  2,000 from  parents in a year, whereas the other, although half as large again, recovers  only  400, whilequite a number of areas  recover merely nominal amounts.  With regard to recovery from parents of the cost of meals, we findu similar  state of  affairs  : while one  County  recovers   27,000,another recovers only  218, while another gives   1 as the amountrecovered.  In Urban Authorities there  are similar variations, sumsranging from  2,400 to   17 and  3 being obtained.  A large number of Authorities recover nothing, although their expenditure  on provision of meals is substantial.  This is a point  requiring investigation with a view  to increasingthe amounts recovered,  and although the cost of recovery is ad-niittedly high, we think that the result on  balance will  be a net reduction in the expenditure from public funds.(b)  School Nurses.  55.  It has been suggested that the  payment  of School  Nursesshould be reviewed and  compared with the salaries paid  to HospitalNurses.  We consider that the  lower salaries of  Hospital Nurses furnish noargument  for a reduction  in  the salaries of School  Nurses sinceHospital  Nurses receive other  emoluments  (e.g., accommodation,food, etc.), in addition to their salary, while  School Nurses do not :further, the work of the School Nurse is less attractive than thatof the Hospital Nurse, and higher salaries are therefore required toobtain recruits; and finally, even with the existing salaries, thereis a shortage of supply,  and a reduction  of pay would  only serve toincrease  Local Education Authorities&apos;  difficulties  in obtainingSchool Nurses.       (5) LOCAL  RESEARCH AND  SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.  56.  From   the  beginning of  School  Medical Inspection  theMedical Department of  the Board of Education have  pressed uponthe local medical  staffs the importance of undertaking research work.  &quot;It is essential that this need and this aspect of the work shouldbe clearly understood by  all Educational Authorities.  Time and opportunity, and I may add brains, must be found in  each area forexploration.&quot;  (Report  of  the Chief Medical Officer of  the  Board,1924,  page 152.)  &quot;It is of  primary importance  that  every school doctor  should find a share in it.   Local Education Authorities  would be wise notonly to facilitate  and  encourage  investigation into local medicalproblems by members of their medical staff,  but actually to  expect,and indeed require it.&quot;   (Report of 1925, page 137.)
  In response to this stimulus local school medical staffs have pre-pared hundreds of research reports,  and they are still  being n in.piled at the rate of about one  hundred per annum.  Many of themno doubt, are,  in  the main, compilations of results obtained in thecourse of routine inspection  and treatment.  On  the  other handmany involve  special  investigations  which  make considerable de-mands on the officers&apos; time and attention.  And some of them, asthe Chief Medical Officer of the Board has  said, are of little or  no value.   In addition the Medical Department of the Board itself hasset  up a number of Committees for co-ordinated research on the health of the school child, the reports of which are  from time totime published.  In such a subject as preventive medicine the  need  for continuedresearch cannot be challenged,  indeed no responsible  man would wish to challenge  it, but  it is a question whether time and expensecould not be saved by an extension of the principle of co-ordinationinto the field of local school medical research. In the list of local re-searches appended to  the Annual  Report of  the Board&apos;s ChiefMedical  Officer the same subjects constantly recur,  an inevitableconsequence if  the officers of each separate local service are to  beleft free to  conduct special investigations at any time and on anysubject within the sphere of their professional wTork which  intereststhem.  We therefore recommend that special researches, as distinct fromcompilations based on evidence obtained in the  ordinary course of medical inspection and treatment, should not be initiated without prior reference  to the Medical Department of the Board.   On this reference the Board should consider whether, in  view  of the natureof the research proposed, the demand which it  will  make on thetime and attention of  the local medical officers  employed, the ex-pense to the public purse, both central and local, and the  contribu-tion  to  knowledge of  public  health  which  may  be anticipated, it ought to be approved.  We consider  that under present financial conditions- the principalobject of any local research work should not be the alleviation of theeffects of routine  inspection and treatment upon the officers con-cerned, but  that some useful extension of medical knowledge shouldbe looked for.                          7.  General.               (1) ADMINISTRATION AND  INSPECTION.  57. As we have found to  be the  case with other heads of ex-penditure,  the  cost of  administration and  inspection shows  greatdivergencies between  Authorities.   Over   England  and WalesAuthorities&apos;  estimates for 1932-3 show  unit costs for  administia-tion  and inspection in Elementary education ranging from 4s. 4d.to 20s. 9d.  per child in average attendance. The average cost  forall Authorities  (except London) was  slightly under 10s. per head,
 hut about 90  Authorities exceeded this figure, some by very sub- stantial margins.  Further, not only are the discrepancies over the i ountry as a whole striking; there are also great differences between adjacent Authorities.   For example, in the east and west parts of one county the costs are 11s. 10d.,  and  8s.; a similar  pair of Authorities show costs of 8s. Id. and 12s. 4d.;  while in one County Borough administration  and inspection cost 17s.  Id.  per  unit of average attendance, as against 9s.  7d. in another County Borough dose at hand.  Prima facie, it is difficult to see why there  should be such wide divergencies, and  we therefore recommend that, in  common with ether problems of  this type, the differences should be  investigated with a view to obtaining a greater degree of  uniformity.               (2) SCHOOL ATTENDANCE  OFFICERS.  58.  It is undisputed that during the  past 30 years  the attitude of both parents and children  towards school attendance has com- oletely altered, and that while formerly Attendance Officers were essential to see that all children of school age  attended school  and to prosecute offending parents, people now generally accept school attendance as a matter  of course; and, in fact, most  parents are :-iifflciently impressed with the value of education to see that their children  attend  school regularly.  As  a result  the work of  School Attendance  Officers has  been very considerably lightened,  as is indicated by the continuous fall in the number of prosecutions for non-compliance  with   attendance  bye-laws.  In London, for  ex- ample, the number of summonses  issued has fallen in the last 10 years from 4,909 (in  1923)  to 2,138 (in 1932), and the number of convictions has fallen from 3,092 to 1,296, all indicating the steady diminution in  the  work required of the  School Attendance  Officer.  Authorities have in many cases recognised this fact  by reducing school attendance  staffs,  but we think  that the reduction might be carried further, particularly as there is normally no need for children over 11 years to be subject to the ordinary machinery of the attend- ance office.  We have  made full allowance for  the fact  that  School Attendance Officers frequently  carry out duties additional to those in connection with the enforcement of school attendance, that these duties are  not likely  to  diminish  and  that staff  will always  be required to carry them out.  Even  after  making all allowances,  we consider  that  School Attendance staffs could be reduced by  about 400 officers over  theCountry as a whole.   If  all vacancies occurring in the next year were left unfilled  (with  perhaps a few essential exceptions)  a re- duction  of about 80 officers would  be  obtained by the end of  theyear, representing  an  annual saving of about  16,000;  while if  the suspension of recruitment were continued for five years, the saving in salaries would amount to approximately  80,000 per annum.
           (3) REMUNERATION OF OCCASIONAL TEACHERS.  59. It appears that there are wide differences of practice betweenAuthorities in  the  matter of remuneration of  Occasional Teachers(i.e. teachers not permanently on the Authority&apos;s staff but engagedtemporarily in an emergency).  A large number of Authorities payOccasional Teachers at the full Burnham rate.   Others have flatrates for all  Certificated Teachers and all Uncertificated  Teachers,while one or  two Authorities  pay  the  substitute teacher at thesame rate as the absent teacher.  There is no obligation  on Authorities  to  pay  salaries on the burnham Scales to Occasional Teachers; and  since in the case ofmany Authorities these teachers  have frequently  been out of full-time service for a considerable period with only occasional intervals of service  as  substitutes,  they cannot be expected to have main-tained the standard of teaching which they reached before giving up full-time service.  In such cases there is no very strong ground for paying salaries calculated on  the full Burnham Scale, and  wetherefore recommend that Authorities should review their rates of pay  for such teachers.  A reasonable basis for  relating daily rates  to an annual salaryin the case of  Occasional Teachers would be, that payments  madefor  each  day&apos;s  teaching  should  be  calculated as     of annual salary.  This fraction is arrived at by taking 6\f of  the annual salaryas the weekly payment (this excludes from the  weekly  wage any payment towards annual holidays), and by  taking-! of the weeklyrate as the daily rate  (this includes in  the daily  rate a paymenttowards  Saturdays and Sundays).  The estimated saving under this head is  included in that  givenin the following  section.             (4)  PROVISION  OF SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS.  60. Our investigations  have shown  that wide  variations exist in the practice of Local Education Authorities  in providing Schoolswith a  Substitute  Teacher  when  one of the regular  staff falls ill.Sometimes a Supply Teacher is sent immediately on notification of the absence of  a teacher especially is this so when the  HeadTeacher is in  charge of a class.  If the Head Teacher  is not  incharge of a class the staff is usually expected to carry on for sometime (a  fortnight  is sometimes  mentioned), but  if the absence islikely to be  prolonged  a Substitute is frequently supplied as soonas the absent  teacher&apos;s medical certificate  is received.  &quot;We do not feel  that we can usefully suggest any hard and fastrules regarding  the supplying of  Substitute Teachers; we recom-mend, however, that all  Authorities should review their arrange-ments in  this matter,  and  it should not be taken as a matter ofcourse that a Substitute should be sent to replace an absent teacher.
  We estimate that by adopting the action we suggest with regardto the remuneration of Occasional Teachers and  the use of  sub-rtitute teachers,  Local Authorities should be able to reduce their expenditure on the supply of temporary teachers to schools by about -10,000  a year.              (5)  ECONOMY IN SCHOOL BUILDINGS.  61.  The Board of Education have  already considered ways  and means of effecting economy in the cost of buildings,  and the resultof their  investigations  is embodied   in  Circular 1419.   We  aregenerally in agreement with the Board&apos;s suggestions,  and we donot, therefore, feel that we need pursue this matter, except thatwe desire to stress the point that besides methods of construction,the planning  of buildings, and especially the amount of accommo-ilation tp be provided,  is germane to  the question of cost.                   8.  Administrative Policy.                   (1) PART HI AUTHORITIES.  62.  We have considered the subject of Part III Authorities, butthe issues involved are so complex  that in  tho  time and with theinformation  at our disposal we have not been  able to make  any recommendation.   We think, however, that in  view of  its  im-portance it should be the subject of an immediate investigation bythe Government.                       (2)  BLOCK GRANTS.  63.  The desirability of applying a system of block grants to educa-tion is a question rendered difficult and complex by the many and various  factors involved; and  is too  large  to be dealt with in thetime available. The position  which has resulted from the removalof the statutoi-y minimum grant owing to  the  economy measuresof last  year  is,  however,  not  satisfactory to Local  EducationAuthorities,  and we repeat  here with special reference to Educa-tion the recommendation made in paragraph 13 that there shouldhe an enquiry into the possibility of  extending the block grantsystem.                       CHAPTER  III.                         HOUSING.                       1.  Introductory.  64.  Before  attempting  to  survey  the present position of thehousing  of  the  working  classes we  think it  desirable  that  weshould trace in outline the  history of  the question since the middleof the last century, when  it  first appears  to have  been generallyrealised  that  a new problem had arisen.  The industrial revolutionhad caused a great movement of population into the towns  andthe provision which was made for housing the workers had in most
instances proved inadequate.  The industrialists, by whom in maincases the houses  were provided, usually required their  availablecapital for developing their  growing industries and the accommoda-tion which  they erected for the workers whom they needed inever-increasing numbers  was often deficient  both  in quality andin quantity. - Moreover,  the  law did little  or nothing to  controller regulate the construction of new streets and buildings by  private persons  and companies.    A  further  difficulty  was the  lack of mechanical  transport,  except  for steam  railways.  For this reasonif no other the early industrial towns were bound to  be congested.In these circumstances many of the slums of to-day  were created.  60. In 1848  the first Public Health Act was  passed.  This was followed by  the  Common Lodging Houses Act, 1851, the LocalGovernment Act,   1858,   and   other  legislation  of a  sanitarycharacter which was consolidated in the Public Health Act, 1.875.  Concurrently with this legislation specific  housing powers wereconferred on Local Authorities.  In 1851 powers were given enablinglodging houses to be  provided,  and these powers were  later  ex-tended to the provision of  separate dwellings.  The  Torrens acts of 1868  and onwards  enabled individual  houses unfit for  human habitation to be dealt with; and  the Acts of 1875  and  1879, ofwhich Sir  Richard  Cross was  the  author,  empowered insanitaryareas to be  reconstructed.  The preceding housing legislation wasconsolidated and extended by the Housing Act, 1890, and althoughamendments were  subsequently made from  time  to time  (priri-cipally  by  the Act  of 1909) most of the  provisions of the act of 1890 remained in force until  1925, when they were consolidatedin the Act of that year.  A  somewhat  different  line   of  approach  to  housing  reformoriginated in the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act of 1899, whichempowered  Local Authorities to make  advances to residents toenable them to acquire the ownership of their houses.  66. It is  important to realise that  until  the outbreak  of warin  1914 private  enterprise  had  provided  working-class  houses for  letting  as  it had  provided the  great  majority of  all other commodities; it has been estimated that up  to 1910 99  per cent.of all new houses were provided by private enterprise, and 95 percent, in the years 1910 to 1914.   Public Authorities had indeed boththe  power  and  the duty  to  supplement  this supply  where  itappeared deficient,  but, with  a  few exceptions, little  use wasmade of the powers; and it is  hardly necessary, to add that therewas no subsidy in aid  of the rents of such houses as were  provided.Subsidised municipal  housing is a post-war  development  in thiscountry. Hitherto the main  functions of the Local Authority hadbeen to  see that working-class houses were  kept in  proper repairby  their owners and to secure  that the worst evils  of the earlierunregulated period were not repeated.
                              49                                     O 9 4                                                                     t) t^j  67. It appears that in some districts a shortage oi&apos; working-classhouses had manifested itself before the outbreak of war.  A loweringoi property values had followed the building boom of the early years  of  the century, the  legislation  of 1909-1910  had  shakenconfidence,  and the increasingly close inspection  of working-classproperties by Public Health Authorities had begun to  make  this class of property  less attractive than hitherto to  owners of smallcapital.  There  followed the war period, during which all buildingoi working-class houses  (except for  such special  needs as thoseof munition workers) came to a standstill.  This, then, was the situation which  confronted  Parliament in1U19 the shortage  of  working-class  accommodation  had becomeacute, the  building  industry was depleted, materials were  scarce,prices and interest rates were high and rising, and demobilisationwas rapidly and largely increasing  the  pressure of  demand on analready insufficient supply.   At  the same time new standards ofamenity and comfort were demanded and promised.  oS. In these  circumstances the Government, who  had alreadysince 1915 restricted the rents of existing privately  owned houses,decided on the policy of subsidised  building, and in 1919 the  firstpost-war Housing Act, the  Housing,  Town  Planning, &amp;c,  Act,1919, was  passed.  It  provided  that the Local  Authority  should contribute the  equivalent of a Id. rate,  and the whole remainingloss  (on approved expenditure)  fell, and falls, on  the  Exchequer.Prices soared  as building proceeded  (the  average cost of  eachof the 170,000 houses provided under the Act exceeded  1,000)  andin 1921 the scheme was  terminated.  Further Acts were passed in  1923, .1924,  1926, 1930 and 1931,providing subsidies in various forms.  All these Acts were directedio the provision of houses with  the assistance of  subsidy, and allcontemplated the payment of subsidies both  to Local Authoritiesand  to private enterprise.   There was, however, a marked difference of emphasis, for, while the Acts of 1919  and 1924 contemplated that subsidised  houses would generally  be erected by  the  LocalAuthorities, one of  the main objects of the Act of 1923  was toencourage private enterprise.  The subsidies have  been in aid ofthe provision of new houses, the only exception being the subsidy for the reconditioning  of rural cottages, which is provided underthe Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931.  The  number  of   subsidised  houses  provided  from  1919 to31st March, 1932, exceeds  one  million, of  which  about 650,000have been provided  by Local Authorities.   At&apos; the  same time un-assisted private enterprise has provided about 800,000  houses, of
which more than 600,000 houses are of a rateable value not exceed.ing  26 ( 35 in the Metropolitan Police District).  Broadly speak.ing, it may be said that the houses provided by the Local Authoritiesare available for letting, while the great bulk of those provided b\private  enterprise have been, so far, built  for sale.  69. This  short  preliminary survey  seemed  to us  a necessartintroduction to any  adequate consideration of the present positionComprehensive information about post-war housing legislation, what has been done under it and what it costs is given on pages 17-J-18iof the May Report.  We do not, therefore, propose to recapitulate infull detail  all the facts there set out,  but  expenditure on housiporepresents  by far  the largest capital commitment of Local Autho.rities, and we feel that we should be lacking in a sense of proportionif we did  not give in this Report  some  account of  the housingachievements, expenditure and  liabilities, existing and prospectiveof the Local Authorities and the State.  70.   The  annual  Exchequer commitment in  respect of house:already built or approved  is about  13J  millions and the LociAuthorities&apos;  commitment is about  2% millions.   The  following provision  has  been made by  Parliament in  thjEstimates  for the current year  (1932-33) : Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c, Act, 1919Housing, &amp;c, Act, 1923 ...Housing (Financial Provisions)  Act, 1924Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931Housing Act, 1930      ............Plousing (Rural Authorities) Act, 1931     6,835,0002,594,0003,700,000   16,000  250,000    5,000  There can  be no further building and  therefore  no addition;commitments under the Acts of 1919 and 1923  (except for certaitjslum  schemes which, however,  are nearing completion).   But tiescommitments are incurred as more houses are built under the AciJof 1924, 1930 and 1931, or reconditioned under the Act of 1926, anilit is on these latter Acts that our most important recommendation;]will he made.  71. Appendix II  shows the  number of houses  provided  eac:year under each Act and the amount paid  in Exchequer subsidiesIt will be seen that, as already stated, more than a million subsidise:houses have been erected, and more than  100 millions have ahead;been  paid in  Exchequer subsidies.  We now proceed to consider the position under each Act.
         2.  Position under Post-War Housing Acts.       (1) HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING,  &amp;O., ACT, 1919. 72. More than 170,000 houses have been built under this Act; the sifting annual commitment of the Exchequer is  6,835,000 and of ocal Authorities about  1,000,000. fn the  natural  course of events savings will accrue      (a) From expiry of loan periods for fences, roads and sewers   in  1934-7, 1940-5, and 1950-5.   (Estimated saving by 1937-   about  30,000;  by 1945-about  780,000; by 1955-about    1,080,000.)     (b) From reborrowing at lower rates of interest. (Estimated   saving by 1940 of  S00,000- 850,000, assuming reborrowing   at  4  per  cent.) As the  Exchequer is responsible for all loss over and  above the roiluct of Id. rate any savings  under these heads will  normally ccrue  to the Exchequer,  who will also benefit  from any increase n the  product of Id. rate. Any  further saving can only come from either  (a) the sale of otises  at a price  which  will reduce the existing Exchequer loss or(iii  the letting of houses at increased rents. These possibilities are dealt with later in paragraphs 95  to 97.                (2) HOUSING, &amp;C, ACT, 1923.                (a) Provision  of New  Houses. 7:;. 436,633  houses had been  completed  by  30th September,1929, at which date the scheme of financial assistance was stopped. f these about 350,000 were  built by private enterprise,  12,000 by public  Utility Societies and 74,000  by Local Authorities.  311,000 itract  Exchequer subsidy at the higher rate of  6 per annum  for20 years  and 126,000 at the lower  rate of  4  per  annum for 20years applicable to houses completed between 1st October, 1927, and30th September,  1929. The  annual Exchequer commitment is about  2,360,000 until1943, gradually falling away until 1949  when it ceases. The  cost to the rates  is not separately recorded.                    (b) Slum  Clearance. The  Act also provided for an annual contribution not  exceeding one-half of the  estimated  annual loss likely to be incurred by the
Local  Authority in  carrying  out slum  clearance  and  rehousintschemes.   (Assistance under  this provision  ceased  to  be availablefor new schemes on  the passing of the Housing Act,  1930.)  U;schemes  are assisted under this Act.  The total  capital expenditure on  completion of all schemes  i,estimated at approximately  8,400,000.  The amount included  jtthe Estimates for Exchequer charge for 1932-33 is  100,000, an,;approximately the same amount will fall on the rates.   Subsidy j,expected to continue  at approximately  this figure until about 1984being gradually  extinguished in the following 10 years.  74. We  now  come to  the  Acts of 1924, 1926,  1930  and  193!under  which substantial new commitments  are  being  incurred.         (3) HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1924.  Under this  Act large subsidies are payable from both the Stateand the Local Authorities in aid of new  houses  provided  subjectto the  special rent  and other conditions which the  Act imposes.These conditions are  such that,  in normal circumstances,  onljLocal Authorities have been able to take advantage of the exchequer subsidy which the Act  makes available.  The  Act  provides that  annual Exchequer contributions at therate of  9 for  40  years (or   12 10s. if the house is in an agriculturalparish as defined by the Act), shall be given in  lieu of the contribu-tions authorised by the Housing Act, 1923, for houses provided byLocal Authorities themselves or  under schemes promoted by thenfor  the  erection of houses by private enterprise  or by Public UtilitySocieties, etc., provided that the Local Authority (or Public UtilitySociety) undertake  that  certain special conditions  (including a restrictive condition  as to rents) will be observed.  Under the Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) Order, 1926.made under Section 5 of the  Act, the present contribution payable by the Exchequer for houses completed after 30th September, 1921,is at the rate  of  7  10s. per annum for 40 years, or in agriculturalparishes  11 per annum.   [The Housing  Acts (Revision of  Con-itributions)  Order, 1928, made provision  for a further reduction ofthe contributions for houses completed after 30th September, 1929,to  6 per annum ( 9  10s. in agricultural parishes)-,  but this pro-vision  did not come into force, as the Housing (Revision of  Con-tributions)  Act,   1929,  restored the rates of  7 10s. and   11 for houses completed after 30th September,  1929.] Section 43 of the
 75. We have  accordingly  examined with great  care  the effect which the recent large fall in building prices and in rates of interestwill have on the rents of houses built under the new conditions. The tabular statement  on page  182 of the Report of  the MayCommittee  gives for each quarter since  1925 the  average  cost ofnon-parlour houses, the capital value of the Exchequer subsidy andthe rate  of interest fixed  from time to time  for  loans  from the * These figures make allowance for a proportion of the houses being built in agricultural parishes and so attracting the higher rate of subsidy.Housing Act, 1930,  provides for a further review after 1st October,1933, of the contributions to be made for houses completed after:l date to be specified.   ,v the 31st March, 1932, 401,492 houses had been  erected byIjocal Authorities themselves, and 9,643 by  private enterprise andpublic Utility Societies with assistance under the Act.   he sum provided in the estimates for the current year under thisIAct is .- 3,700,000.   No separate figures are recorded  as  to the costto the rates, but it is probably of the order of   1 1J millions.  The Exchequer is committed to annual expenditure for a periodlof -10 years  and if building were to continue at the present rate of[subsidy additional commitments would be incurred as follows :-                              Exchequer.            Rates.

On financial grounds we  cannot but[view with grave  concern  this large annual increase in national andlloeal  commitments, while  on  economic grounds  we  consider  it  eutial that the supply of what is still in  many areas in urgentdemand  should,  at  the earliest practicable  moment, be divorced from  considerations  of subsidy.  For at present private enterpriseclaims that it is deterred  from meeting this demand  by fear  ofsubsidised municipal competition, while on the other hand public authorities may  naturally be  deterred under  existing  financial con-ditious by consideration of  the charge which the  provision of new houses would throw on the taxes  and the rates.

X Based on prices of contracts let during  the previous three months phi 70 for land, roads and sewers.  $ The average cost for the three months ended 31st  July, 1932, was  313.and for tho latest period  for which figures are availablo, viz., the three mom!;&apos;ended  31st August, 1932,  369.  It will be seen that the rates of interest have been  5 per cent.for the greater part of the time and although only  about one-halfof the money raised for housing has been obtained  from the local loans Fund, the rate is probably a fair index of the prevailing ratesfor loans raised by  stock issues and mortgages.  Interest rates have
varied above and below 5 per cent, for short periods, but an average rate of  approximately 5  per cent,  may be assumed  for buildinggenerally during the period from 1925 to the present time.  76. It will be observed that  before September, 1927, when theGovernment and rates contributions stood at the higher figures of   and  4 10s.  respectively,  the all-in cost per house averagedapproximately  510.   The annual loan  charges  on a 60 year basis3t 5 per cent, were approximately  27  and the  annual value on a00 vear  basis of the combined subsidies was approximately  12. Thedifference between these two  figures, viz.,  15, represented theamount  to   be-   obtained   from   rent  (in  addition  to  theamount required for repairs, &amp;c).  In September, 1927, the combined subsidies  were reduced  to a value equivalent to approximately  10 per annum for 60 years. by september, 1928,  the all-in cost had fallen to  440 loan charges 23 per annum and by September, 1929,  to  410 loan charges121 10s. per annum ; and the all-in cost  remained in  the  neighbour-hood of this figure until the last nine months.  During the wholeof this  period there  had been  practically no  change  in  the ratesof interest.  The recent  general reduction of interest yield on  government securities (which is accompanied by  a corresponding change in thevield on  municipal  securities)  is  a new  and important   factor.Several Ixical Authorities have  already reduced their rate on short-term mortgages to 3  per cent.  An average rate of not more than per cent, in the near future may be assumed.    Concurrentlythere has been a fall in  the all-in cost per house to  380, with theresult that the annual loan charges  on  a house  built to-day would amount to  only  17  per annum.  Since the inception of the 1924 scheme there has,  therefore,  beena reduction of some  10 per house in the annual loan charges, due partly to a fall in the cost of building and partly to a fall in interestrites, while  during  the  same  period the  value of the  combinedsubsidies has been reduced  by the equivalent of  2  per  annum for60 years.  The difference of  S, or 3s. per week, represents theadvantage  in rent* attaching to the later-built  houses; for houses built at a  cost  of   510,  rate of  interest  5 per  cent.,  subsidy. 9   4 10s. the rent required was 7s. 9d.; for a house costing  380,rate of interest 4  per cent., subsidy  7 10s.  4-  3 15s. the rentrequired would be 4s. 9d.  Viewed from another  angle,  if the rent of 7s. 9d. required for a house built in  1925 had been charged for  all later houses and theentire benefit of reduced costs had  been reflected in reduction  of subsidy, the combined subsidies would have been reduced to approxi-matety  2 per annum  for 60 years more  exactly  2 2s. 4d., * In practice this reduction has frequently not been made in the later builthouses but has been spread  over all  the houses including those built earlier atlii^hor costs.
equivalent to  2 8s.  4d.  per annum  for 40 years.   Shared in theexisting proportions, this would involve an  Exchequer contribution of  1 12s. 3d. and a  rate contribution of 16s.  Id.   The amount oi 2 2s. 4d., or 9d. per week, represents the  difference  between theeconomic rent 8s. 6d.  per week of  a house built  by  a  LocalAuthority  to-day and the subsidised  rent 7s. 9d.  per  week re-quired at the  inception of the scheme.   77.

  78. It will be seen from  the  foregoing table  that the averageiil!-in cost  of houses provided during the quarter ended 30th june last  was  380 and  that the  economic rent of such a house  (withmoney at 4 per cent,  and  repayment of debt in 60 years) is 8s.  6d.a  week after providing  5 10s. per aunum for repairs, maintenance and  voids, etc.  When the  scheme of  subsidy under  the Act of1924 was initiated  a rent  of 7s. 9d.  was contemplated with the aid of subsidies.  In other words a  position  has  been  reached  whereonly 9d.* a week separates the possible unsubsidised rent of a househuiit to-day  from the  subsidised  rent required at the inception ofthe  scheme.  If the rate of interest falls to  3   per  cent,  this difference of 9d.would be reduced to 2d.;  nearly the same result would  follow froma reduction of  30 in the average capital cost of a house (the interestrate remaining at 4 per cent.) and a reduction  of   45 in the capital cost would wipe out the difference entirely.  In this connection wedraw attention to  the fact that  the figures for  the  three months ended 31st July, 1932, show that the average cost  had fallen toi&apos;373 and that the  latest  figures  available, viz. those for the threemonths  ended  31st  August,  1932,  show a further  fall to   369.  Moreover,  we consider that on the average a  substantial reductionin all-in cost over  the figure of  3SQ, which is the figure taken asthe  basis  of our  calculations,  could  be  secured  (a  number of authorities have already  done this) if  more  rigid  economy werestudied in  the lay-out, planning  and specifications of the houses see paragraph 87 below.  In the circumstances we do not consider that there is justificationin maintaining the expensive and  complicated  mechanism of  asubsidised  scheme  for  the sake of a figure which on  the basis of a cost of  380 per house and interest at  4 per  cent, amounts to no more than 9d. a week, and which we have every reason to believewill disappear altogether  with a further fall in the cost of  money or building.  79. There is  the further important consideration that, when on previous occasions housing subsidies  have been  abolished or reduced,3 substantial fall in building prices has followed.  We are aware that conditions  in the industry and the general economic  position are somewhat  different  to-day, but we shall  be surprised if  history doesnot repeat itself in this matter if our recommendation is adopted. * It will be seen that a constant figure.of 2s. Id. per week ( 5 10s. p.a.) hasbeen taken for repairs, etc.  Strictly a higher figure would be appropriate inrespect of  houses built in the  earlier years when the cost of repairs was higher (say 2s. 6d.).  If tho figure of 2s. 6d. per week were taken  for tho period ending June, 1927, the difference between the rent then contemplated and theeconomic rent of to-day (on the basis of a cost of  380 per house and interest at t per cent.) would be reduced from 9d. to Ad. (the comparable figures beingis. 2d. per week and 8s. 6d.)
  80. It has been represented to us that, while it is sound to airnat the abolition of the subsidy as soon as possible and while a sub-stantial immediate reduction can be justified, it would be preferable to proceed by  stages in order to avoid a sudden change and con-sequent  dislocation  of  the plans  of Local  Authorities  and thearrangements of the industry.       We have given full weight to this argument, but in  our view it is more than counter-balanced by the following considerations       (a) We  consider  that  the psychological effect  of a definite     decision to terminate subsidy forthwith  will be of great value     in inducing the private builder  and the  private investor  to re-     turn  without undue delay to  the provision of  working class     houses  (o  let.       (b) We  desire to avoid the administrative difficulties which     are liable  to arise if decisions to alter or abolish subsidy at a     future date are announced beforehand.       (c) As stated  above, we  do not consider that it  would be     justifiable  to maintain the machinery of a  subsidised scheme     for the sake of a difference of about 9d.  a week  in the rent.  81. As  we have  said, we look forward to the return of privateenterprise to the provision of working class houses to let, and in thisconnection  we  await with interest  the  publication  of  proposalswhich,  we  are informed,  the  National  Association of  building societies propose to submit to the Minister of Health  in the courseof the next few weeks.  But we contemplate that in the immediatefuture a considerable number of Local Authorities may find it neces-sary  to provide houses  to let  without subsidy, where   they  aresatisfied that a clear need remains to be met and  that private enter-prise is unable  to meet  it.  We  are, however, strongly of opinionthat the time has come when the normal provision  of new working class houses (by whomsoever  undertaken) should  cease  to be charge on either the taxpayer or the ratepayer, and we  therefore recommend that the Minister of Health should entertain no furtherapplications involving subsidy under the Act of 1924,  and that earlysteps should be taken  to repeal the Act.  We realise  that  there  will  be  commitments  and quasi-com-commitments, into which Local Authorities may have entered with theapproval of the Minister, and we therefore recommend further thatthe Minister should be empowered until the 31st March, 1933. tcapprove for subsidy under  the Act such a limited  further numberof houses  as may be necessary to liquidate such commitments.                (4) HOUSES  FOE AGED PERSONS.  82. Under the amendment  made by section 46  of the  housing act, 1930, smaller houses for aged persons are eligible for a subsidy of two-thirds of the  rate  applicable to the ordinary houses  under
the. Act of 1924, subject to their being let to persons of that descrip-tion at two-thirds of the appropriate normal rent or subject to suchaddition thereto as may be necessary to limit the charge on the localrales to  2 10s. per house per annum.  Some  Local  Authorities  are  inclined  to  adopt  unnecessarilyelaborate plans for these houses, but if building costs were restricted to  180 with  about  40 for land, roads and sewers  220 all-in the following  rents would be possible without subsidy                                                        Loan  charges  at  4  per  cent,  half-yearly     annuity for 60 years  on  220 .  ...     ...    9.7    Add for repairs,  &amp;c.   ...     ...     ...     ...    3.5Rent per annum      ...     ...     ...    ...  13.2   Rent per week ...    ...     ...    ...     ...    5s.   (approx.)  If as a  matter of policy  it  is  considered  that  the balance  ofadvantage lies in continuing to provide assistance for the tenants ofthese houses under the Housing Acts, we consider that the subsidy of  5 from  the  Exchequer should  be halved;  and should  be made conditional on a fixed contribution equivalent to  1 5s. per houseper annum for 40 years  being made from the rates.  The value ofthe halved total subsidy ( 3 15s. for 40 years) would enable anaverage rent relief of about Is. 3d.  a week per house to be given.     (5) HOUSING  (RURAL WORKERS) ACTS, 1926 AND 1931.  83. These Acts enable Local Authorities, where application is received before  1st  October,  1936,  to give assistance by way  ofgiants towards the cost of reconstruction or improvement of dwell-ings for agricultural workers  or others of like  economic condition.The grant (which may be a lump sum or in the form of annual  pay-ment for 20 years) is limited  to two-thirds of the estimated cost ofthe work, subject to a maximum of   100 for each dwelling.  The Acts  limit the increase  of  rent that may  be charged  con-sequent on the improvement.  The  Exchequer contributes  one-half of the  annual  cost  in-r-iirred by the Local Authority in providing assistance, spread  over20 years.  The  provision in  the  estimates for  1932-3  is  16,000,  which represents  approximately one-half  of the  loan charges payable onthe amount of grants paid at  31st March, 1932.  Approximately thesame amount falls on the rates.   At the expected rate of progressthe Exchequer  provision in future years will show an increase ofabout  6,000 a year.  The  Acts  also  empower  Local  Authorities  to  advance  moneyson loan at prescribed rates of interest, but  hitherto very  little usehas been made of this facility.
  Up to  the 31st March,  1932, assistance  had  been  promised by Local Authorities by way of grants in respect of 5,309 dwellingto a total of  440,339. At the same date work had been finished on ,775 dwellings and grants paid to a total of  376,932.  We understand  that  the  Rural  District Councils  Associationattach great  importance  to these  Acts  which  enable  existinocottages to be reconditioned and preserved.  It is claimed  that they provide a most satisfactory and economical method of providing im.proved  accommodation  for  agricultural  workers,  and that trueeconomy would  lie not in the abolition of  the Acts, but in theiimore widespread operation.   We understand that the Acts havebeen  more widely used in  Scotland than in England, and we share the view  that greater use should be made  of  the facilities  whichthey  provide.  We consider that, with this end  in  view, furtherconsideration should  be  given to  the question of relaxing some of the  more stringent conditions attaching to the making of grants andadvances under the Acts. The opinion has also been expressed thaithere would be advantage  in placing the administration of the Actsin the hands of Rural District  Councils, and we  recommend thatthis suggestion should be further explored.                     (6) HOUSING ACT, 1930.  84. Exchequer subsidy under this Act takes the form of annual payments  for 40 years  towards expenses incurred  by  a  LocalAuthority in providing rehousing  accommodation in consequence o!action taken by them under the Act resulting  in  displacement oipersons from slum areas, and individual unfit houses  demolished orparts of buildings closed.       The  annual Exchequer subsidy  is normally at the rate oi 2  5s. Od. multiplied by the number of persons displaced, subjectto suitable accommodation  in  new houses  being provided. Therate is  2 10s.  Od. per  person in the case of displacements frorragricultural parishes and   3 10s. Od. where rehousing accommo-dation is provided in  tenement buildings of more than three storeys.either on the cleared site or on other expensive  sites (exceeding 3,000 an acre).  The contribution from the rates in each  case is  3 15s. Od. perhouse or tenement provided.  Payment of the  subsidies is  contingent on the  observance ofcertain special conditions as to letting  and as to the rents to becharged.  The rents are not to exceed an amount which will suffice to meet the  cost of the  scheme  after taking into account the value of theExchequer contribution  and a  contribution  from  the  rates of 3 15s. Od. per house per  annum for 40 years&apos;.
 85. At the 31st March, 1932, 2,429 houses had been completedtinder the Act.  Of the total number of houses under constructionby Local Authorities at that date, 1,824 had been definitely allocated to (he Act of 1930 and 8,989 could be allocated on  completion eitherto the Act of 1924 or to the Act of 1930 as the Local  authority should find necessary. The amount provided  in the estimates for the current year is 250,000, but it is improbable,  at the present rate of progress, thatthe whole of this amount will be required. The Exchequer subsidy is for 40 years and if it were to continue at t he present rate would involve-an annual expenditure of about :-        Exchequer.  Rates.           62,500    18,750 for 5,000 replacement houses.          125,000    37,500 for 10,000 replacement houses.          187,500    56,250 for 15,000 replacement houses.  We  recommend  that  a reduction   should  be  made in  theexisting  Exchequer  subsidy and rate contribution commensurate with the substantial reductions  in the cost of building and rates ofinterest which have occurred since 1930. A novel basis of Exchequer assistance was adopted in  this Act,the subsidy being based on the  number of persons  displaced  by action taken under the Act; the rate contribution on the other handis a fixed sum for each house required to be provided in  dischargeof  the rehousing obligation.    We understand  that some LocalAuthorities have found this basis of Exchequer  assistance incon-venient to administer and we further recommend that the reducedsubsidy should be a  fixed sum in respect of each  house provided indischarge of the rehousing obligation.        (7) HOUSING  (RURAL  AUTHORITIES) ACT,  1931.  86. This  Act  enables additional  Exchequer  assistance to  begranted, on  the recommendation  of   an Advisory  Committeeappointed under the Act, towards the provision of houses for occu-pation by agricultural workers  and others of a similarly low rentpaying  capacity, in  agricultural parishes of rural  districts whoseCouncils satisfied certain conditions and made application before30th  November,  1931.    Applications   were   received  from  145Councils in respect of 6,841 houses, of which 5,789 were proposed for members of the agricultural  population, as defined in  Section 60of  the  Housing Act,  1930.  23 Councils  have  later  withdrawntheir application, and 14 applications were rejected  by the Com-taittee.  The Committee,  of which the Chairman is the Rt.   Hon.  SirJ.  Tudor Walters, decided to entertain  proposals for the provisionof a limited number of houses,  not  exceeding 2,000 for occupation by members of the agricultural  population, and the remaining 108*Councils have been notified that their proposals  will be entertained.    * This is the net figure after deducting  applications withdrawn.
  The amount of special  assistance required will  depend on  f[.recommendations of the Committee having regard to the actual co;of the houses; an amount of  5,000 is included in the estimates fjthis  year but  we understand that it is hoped so to limit the cosby close supervision of the schemes that only a small part of tilamount will be required.   In this  connection attention is drainto paragraph  87.   (This assistance  is  additional  to  the ordinarcontribution of  11 under the Act of 1924, provision for which!included in  the estimates for houses provided under that Act.)  The cost  to the rates will vary from  2 to  3 15s. Od. per housincluding a contribution of  1 from  the County Council  undfSection 34 of the Housing  Act, 1930.  We understand that 106 Rural District Councils have been it.formed that proposals  would be  entertained  for the  provision,;1,814  houses,  which  must  be regarded  as commitments.    \V.recommend  that applications in respect of further houses in exce;of the  maximum number of 2,000 already  fixed by the TutWalters Committee should not be entertained.        (8)  POSSIBILITIES  OF MORE ECONOMICAL BUILDING.  87.  In paragraph  78 we expressed the view that  lower  builting prices should be obtainable if greater economy were exercise!in layout, planning and specifications.  We had especially in minrecent experience of the working  of the Act  of 1931, under  whitit has been  possible, owing to the  limited field of action, to exercisa close control of the details of  the schemes.  We  are informsthat, by adopting every reasonable economy in the plans and specfications of  the houses  consistent  with efficient building, very  lo;prices have  been obtained in the limited number of schemes  whentenders have so far been  invited.  The average tender price  pehouse in the 21 schemes (for 480* houses) where tenders have bee:approved is  282 as compared with an average price for all rundistricts,  during  the  3 months ended 31st  July,  1932, of   311And the average price for land, development and overhead chargehas been only about  30 per house.  It  is true that only  a small number of tenders have yet bee:obtained  and  if  they  constituted  the only evidence  we  shouShesitate to draw any general conclusion.  But we are informed thiin the course of examining the specifications of nearly all Authoritfewho have made application under the Act it has been found possibleto suggest substantial economies  which could be adopted  withoc:detriment to the efficiency of the houses.  This evidence is con-firmed, moreover, by the general  experience  of the Department itcases of ordinary housing under the Act of 1924.  We are inform;:that in the normal course  close central supervision has not bee:  * Including 82 houses provided under the Act of 1924 but included in tksame contracts with the houses provided under the Act of 1931.
o 9 QxJ hj O 3.  Consolidation of Subsidies and Management of Municipal                       Housing Estates.  38. Under  this  general  heading  we  propose  to consider  in mi; particular :-       (a) the possibility of simplifying and consolidating the exist-    ing  statutory and  other regulations  governing  the rents and    management of municipal houses;      (6) the management and allocation of accommodation;      (c) the means of tenants;      (rf) the possibility  of  selling  some  of the municipal houses.               (1)  CONSOLIDATION OF SUBSIDIES.  89. In  our  view  the  existing  law  and  regulations,  however necessary  they may have been in  earlier  stages,  are now un- necessarily complex and restrictive.  We  do not think it necessary :o set them out in greater detail than has already been  done in the separate sections  dealing  with each  Act; those who are familiarlivith  them  are unlikely to  disagree with our view  of  then: com-  exity.  Houses provided under the Act of 1919 are subject  to  an entirely  different  code of conditions and regulations  from  those provided under the  Act of 1924, while houses provided under the Acts  of  1930 and  1931 are again  subject to codes  differing  both join the earlier codes  and from each other.  It is only in regard :o houses provided under the Act of 1923 that the Local Authority enjoy a full discretion.  90. We consider  that the objective should  be  to set free and to neourage every Local Authority  to manage or dispose of  their Housing  estates according to the principles of good estate manage-Iment, having regard to their dual capacity  as trustee for the  rate-Ipayer and as the public authority responsible for the  general healthland  housing conditions of their area.  91. As the  law  and regulations stand  at  present  it may  be (necessary to pursue a different policy in managing the houses pro-jrided  under the  Act of 1919  from  that which is  appropriate  to houses provided under  other Acts.  The houses  provided under the...&quot;thought practicable  in  recent years owing to the volume of  workwhich would be entailed, but, where occasion has arisen to examinech-sely the details of the  proposals submitted by some Authorities,jt has commonly been found that substantial  economies can be(suggested. Attention  is  drawn  to  this  question  and  a list of possibleIeconomies  is suggested in the last Annual Report of the Ministryof Health  (pages 281-2).
Act  of  1919 cost the State on the average  about   40  each  r*annum  and, as the whole  loss falls on the State after the I^ocaAuthority has contributed the product of Id.  rate, it is  nccessarto have regard  primarily to the rent paying  capacity of tenant;if  the onerous  Exchequer burden is not to be increased.   On  ttother hand it is undesirable that so much emphasis  should bo  la;on rent paying capacity  in selecting tenants for houses  provideunder other  Acts.   It is manifestly difficult  to  have two policisin one district  (perhaps on one estate) according to  the Act nodewhich the houses were provided.  For  this reason if no other wconsider it  desirable that at the earliest possible opportunity  municipal houses should  so far as practicable be placed on a siraihfooting.  92. We  consider that  the existing  Exchequer subsidies nndithe Acts of 1923 and 1924  should be consolidated in  a block gras(as has  been done for other services).  It is obvious,  however,  thsthe full benefit of consolidation  would not accrue  from dealing witthese Acts  alone while  the houses  built under  the Act of 19!remained  under a  separate code.  We  think  that the ideal to Iaimed at is a comprehensive scheme of consolidation covering tvActs of 1919, 1923 and 1924.  93. Machinery at present exists in section  45 of the Act of  19;enabling Local Authorities to make agreements  with the Ministeof Health  for consolidating subsidy under the Act of 1919.  Thmachinery, however, has  not  been extensively used  by LoaAuthorities and  we consider that the  position  should  be furthsexplored.  Many Local Authorities are  reluctant to enter into agreement which are incapable of  revision  at  a later date if  circumstancechange.  The law  at present  does not  appear to admit of agreements being made for  limited periods,  and we think  that  th:question of amending it so as to make such agreements  possible!-should be carefully considered.  It would no  doubt be an inducement  to a Local Authority tienter into such  an agreement if one of its  terms  were that threstrictive  conditions under the Act of 1924 should be removed in this  connection  an important consideration arises  at the presettime in regard  to  the rent conditions of the Act of 1924, whidprovide that the average rental shall not exceed the average presetrent of pre-war houses in the district, unless this  involves the LociAuthority in a contribution from the rates in  excess  of the equirolent of  3 15s. Od. per house per annum for 40 years.  In practismost Local Authorities  find  it  necessary  to make  the  con-tribution of  3 15s. Od. per house in order to  comply with the  eon-ditions  of  the  Act, and  it would  appear that any  savings whiclmay  result from reborrowing  at lower rates of interest or  froE
                                                                    9 9CI                             65                                     %) ht O,ji;iiging well-to-do tenants higher rents would, under the conditions,\n required to  he applied in reduction of the  aggregate  rental,Whether the local circumstances made such a reduction necessary(r not.  We consider that savings  of  this character  should enureio the benefit of the State and the Local Authority. We accordingly recommend      (a) that the power to make agreements with the Minister of   Health for stabilising subsidy under the Act of 1919 should be   extended  to subsidies under the Acts of 1923 and 1924;     (6) that it should be a  condition of any such agreement that   the restrictive rent conditions under the Act of 1924 should be   abolished in regard to  existing  houses;     (c) that consideration  should be given  to the question of   amending  the law  so  as to enable agreements  for a  limited   period to be made ; and     (d) that any savings which  may be secured by reborrowing   at lower rates of interest or a revision of rents or otherwise   should  be  shared  equitably  between  the Exchequer and the   Local Authority.    (2) MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION OF ACCOMMODATION.  94.  We now  propose to consider the use and  disposal of muni- jnal houses on the footing that our recommendation is accepted at  existing grants  be  consolidated  and restrictions removed. Whatever policy be adopted  in principle will doubtless  require to x adapted  to the circumstances of each district, but we shall at east have got  rid of the complications attendant on the different ales of  conditions and restrictions of  each  separate Act.  95.  We think that  the following  principles  should  command teneral agreement      (1) that subsidies should not be wasted by being given to   those who do not  need them;     (2) that in present financial  circumstances  every  reasonable   endeavour should be made to increase the revenue obtainable or   to reduce the loss arising from housing estates, by requiring   tenants who can afford it either (a) to pay higher rents or in   some cases to buy their houses and so release public capital   for other purposes or  (b) to vacate their houses which would   thus become available either for sale in the open  market or for   accommodating poorer workers who are unable to provide for   themselves; and     (3) that accommodation should  not  be wasted, as happens,   for  example, where a 3-bedroomed  house is allocated to  a   couple without children or with only one child, or where such   a house continues  to be occupied  by parents  whose  family has   left  them.167(5GC
                     (3) MEANS OF TENANTS.  96. It is freely  stated  that  there  are considerable  numbers olmunicipal  tenants  who are not  in need of subsidised accommoda-tion and who could  not be described as members of the workingclasses for whom the benefit of the Acts was intended.  We havenot ascertained how much truth there  is in this contention, butwe  think that the matter is one which requires  careful and im.mediate  investigation by  every Local Authority.  Which  of themethods suggested above  may be  most appropriate  for  dealinowith such  a situation, where it is  found to exist, will depend or:the facts of each case.  The  matter is clearly one of difficulty andit is impossible to  lay down any hard and fast rule.  In this con-nection attention  is  drawn to  page 102 of the Annual  Report of the  Ministry of Health for 1931-2.         (4) SALE  OF HOUSES  AND REVISION  OF RENTS.  97. We  understand that it has been  the policy of the Ministerof Health  to encourage the sale of  houses (especially  of  those pro-vided under the Act of 1919) and that  circulars have been issuecto Local Authorities as to the general conditions governing saies.These  conditions provide for sales for cash or by instalments spreadover 15, 20 or  25  years with initial  deposits of from .- 20  to fofaccording  to the period of payment.  Sales of houses provided under the Act of 1919 are  approved of the  basis of market  value subject to a minimum sale  price, basedon  the present-net rental of the houses, sufficient to secure that the sale shall not result in a loss.  This, in effect, means that thecapital sum received for  a sale must be at least  sufficient whetinvested at current rates  of  interest&apos;to bring  in an  income equito the net rent surrendered,  and it follows that the sale price wilhave to be higher  than hitherto if the present  low yield on invest-ments continues.   The position, as the law stands at  present,  in regard  to sales o:houses provided under the  Acts of  1923 and 1924 is somewkdifferent owing to the different nature of the  subsidies.  A sale aa house built under  the Act  of 1923  does not  affect the  exchequer:liability for subsidy; and a sale of a house built under  the Act o:1924 has  the  effect of reducing the subsidy  payable to the leveof  the subsidy payable under the Act of 1923, unless the house was completed since September, 1929, in which case subsidy ceassto  be  payable (whatever  the date of completion subsidy continueto  be  payable at  the full  rate  if   the  sale  is  made  subject t;observance of  the special conditions by the purchaser).   The possibility  of  selling  houses at satisfactory prices is close;; bound up with the question of the  rents at  present  charged  fe such houses, and we think it important  that this aspect of the ques tion should not be overlooked.  For example,  the average exclush:
 till of the 170,000 houses provided under the Act of 1919, whichre costing  the  Exchequer  on the  average about   40  each permum, is only about 9s. 4d. a week.  More than half these housesK of the parlour type. The  question  whether the  rents  charged  for  some  municipaloiises should be  raised  should be considered  in  the light  of localrcmnstances, including the general housing needs  and  conditions the  district, and where sales are  contemplated they should notecessarily be on  the basis of the existing subsidised rentals. The  position will doubtless be  found to vary from  district  to strict and it will be necessary to obtain the  advice of the &quot;Valua- )ii Department  as to the  market value of the houses in  relationi other available houses in the locality; for on  this will depend-e practicability of revising rents or selling houses in any con- Jerable numbers. We think it desirable  that the general policy of sales  should  beneouraged and we recommend that  Local Authorities be urged  to ake widely known the facilities  for purchase.                 4. Rent Restrictions Acts. 98. It  is  perhaps not within our terms of reference  to  makeeeommendations as to these Acts, but it is obvious  that  the policyn regard  to the provision  of new houses  must  be considered  inrlation to and co-ordinated with  the policy in regard to  existing jtttrolled houses.  We  are aware that the  whole question of rent gt-riction was recently investigated by an Inter-Departmental Com- littee and we have studied their Report with care.   Their recom- lendations envisaged a long term  programme of production of small ouses at  low rents by Local Authorities, coupled with an attemptj restore mobility  in  working class  tenancies  (and so  facilitate :e process known as  &quot; filtering up &quot;) by  substituting for  the poradic  method  of  decontrol  introduced  by  the Act  of 1923 aaethod of decontrol of  classes of houses as and  when shortage in A class was found to have disappeared. We. on the other hand, are looking to private enterprise to providea future  the  main supply  of  new houses for the working classes, implemented where necessary by the provision by Local Authorities [houses without subsidy.  In either case we appreciate that it mayfee difficult to achieve such low rents as the poorer workers cannormally  afford.   In this  respect our recommendations  contem-clate a return to  the earlier housing  policy  under  which  LocalAuthorities  found it necessary on account of the  higher cost ofbuilding to select their tenants in the main from  the more  substan- ial workers,  relying on the process  of &quot; filtering up &quot;  to benefit the poorer classes.  It will, therefore, be even more important thatfreedom of movement should  be restored in order that the pooreritorkers  (for  whom  the Inter-Departmental  Committee&apos;s ReportKiTGb&apos;C 2
insists the shortage is most acute) may benefit indirectly from thenew provision.  In our view  the best way to achieve this result-apart  from  other  considerations would  be entirely to  removerestrictions.  But,  if this is considered undesirable or impracticableas a matter of policy, we do  not think that legislaton on the mainlines of the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report would be in.consistent with our recommendations.                          5.  Summary.  99. It may be convenient if  at this  stage  we summarise shortlyour  principal recommendations.  We recognise that for the  work of  slum clearance, which must continue  to be undertaken by Local Authorities,  a subsidy is stillneeded, but we recommend a substantial reduction in the  existing rates of subsidy  having regard  to the fall which  has taken place since 1930 in the cost of building and the price of money.  We consider, however, that the time has come when the normalprovision  of working class  houses  (by  whomsoever undertaken!should cease to be a charge on the public  purse.  Our principalrecommendation is, therefore,  that subsidy under  the Act  of 1921should be abolished.  We do not think it  necessary to recapitulatehere all the  arguments and figures which have led us to this con-elusion ;  they will  be found  fully set  out in paragraphs 74 to 81above.  We  desire, however,, to record our  opinion that subsidiesare bad in themselves and only to be defended on grounds of specialnecessity, the  onus  of proof resting on  those  who support theiigranting  or continuance.  Housing subsidies have  in the past beetvariously  defended, according to the circumstances in which the;were granted, as designed to  divert capital and labour to the builc-ing  of cottages from other more profitable employment,  to  improve the standard of amenity, and to bridge the gap between the economi;rent and  the rent  which  the working classes could afford to pay.The first  of  these  purposes does not arise for consideration at thepresent time; the second has been achieved and there is no need c:a subsidy to  maintain the position which has been secured; and thefigures which we have given show  that  the  gap which  existed it1924 of 4s. 8d. between  the  economic rent and the rent then eon-templated as reasonable  has  almost entirely  disappeared owing ietho  fall in the cost of building and  the rate  of interest.  In othewords there is no longer need of a subsidy to bridge it.  We think it probable that the combined effect of the saturation:in some districts of the demand for houses for sale, the  withdrawalof subsidised competition in  houses  to let, the general lowering ciinterest rates on gilt-edged investments, and the reduction in builii-ing  costs will  be  to induce the private builder and-still moreimportant the private investor to return to the provision of house;for  letting to the  working classes.  To this  end we consider that
                              69                                    93                                                                    t)immediate policy  should be directed.   If it fails, there may be no alternative but to  recognise that the provision of housing accommo-dation for such of the working classes as  are not in a position  to buy their houses  will have become  finally and  exclusively the function of Public Authorities.  We  cannot think, however,  that private enterprise, if given its opportunity,  will fail to grasp it.  At the same time it will be the duty of the Local Authority,  as before the War, to watch the  position with care and be  preparedto step in to  supplement the action of private  enterprise by them-selves providing houses of an economical type, without subsidy fromthe taxes or the rates, where a need  is shown to exist and privateenterprise is unable to meet it.  We consider that the withdrawal of subsidy will have a salutary effect in checking extravagant proposals.                       CHAPTER  IV.                ROADS  AND  BRIDGES.                        1.  Introductory.   100. The  Highways of Great  Britain are divided for  adminis-trative purposes  into two main  categories, i.e., Classified roads and Unclassified Roads Classified Roads being the more importantthrough traffic routes  singled out  as such by the Ministry of Trans-port under  powers contained  in Section  17  of the  Ministry  ofTransport Act, 1919; they are sub-divided into two  classes knownas Class I and Class  II.  The classification is not on the basis ofdiffering quality, but  upon traffic usage  and for the  purpose  of determining  the  proportion   of  contribution  towards  cost  by central  and  local revenues respectively, though it is natural thatthose roads  which bear a  great proportion  of long-distance traffic and so merit a contribution  from central revenues,  should on theaverage be the more  expensive and of better quality.   101. Expenditure on roads  and bridges may  be grouped underfour  headings, viz. (1)&quot; Maintenance  and  Minor  Improvement within the existing limits of  the highway (including  resurfacing with improved materials), (2) Major Improvement (widenihgs, etc.) and  new Construction,   (3) Cleansing and Watering&quot;,  and  (4) Administration (salaries, travelling expenses and office accommoda- tion of the  staff of the Highways and  Bridges Department and all other administrative expenditure charged to highways  account).   102. The  Road  Fund  (instituted  in  its earliest  form  by the Development and Road Improvement  Funds Act, 1909), is adminis- tered by the Ministry of  Transport,  and is an important factor in   * Cleansing and watering is mainly  a sanitary service  and can  be regarded as only in a lesser degree essential to road maintenance.    16766                                                   C 3
the highway finance of Local Authorities.  The costs of main-tenance and the minor improvement of Classified Roads in Countyareas  are met  from the Fund to the extent of 60 per cent, forClass  I roads and 50 per cent, for Class II roads; while a sum ofabout  6J- million is retained each year from the Fund and paidtowards  the  General Exchequer  Contribution  to Local  Govern-raent  expenses (instituted  by the Local Government Act of 1929and the Local  Government (Scotland) Act, 1929).  This contribu-tion is in aid of, inter alia, the expenditure incurred on the main-tenance  and  minor  improvement of Classified  Roads  in Londonand the County Boroughs of England and Wales and in the large burghs of Scotland, and on the maintenance of  Unclassified Roadsin all  County Areas. Capital grants  of varying percentage between50 per cent, and 85 per cent., or in exceptional cases more, havebeen made from the Fund towards the cost of most of the importantworks of improvement and new construction  in  Great Britain.Under  Section  17  (2)  of  the Ministry  of Transport  Act,  1919,grants of 50 per cent, are made towards  the salaries and travelling expenses of engineers and surveyors to Highway Authorities inGreat Britain.  2. Action taken since the Issue of the Report of the May                          Committee.  103.  We have taken the position as reported  by the May Com-mittee  as the starting point of our investigations.   So far as Eoadand  Bridge expenditure is  concerned the Report  dealt with theRoad Fund, i.e.,  the  contributions  from  Government  fundstowards the expenditure incurred by Local Authorities.  When theReport was issued,  it was estimated that payments from the fund in the year  1931-2 would  amount to  33,395,000 increasing to 34,340,000  in  1932-3,  and  then decreasing to   32,735,000 in1933-4,  29,415,000 in 1934-5 and  25,445,000 in 1935-6.  Includedin these  estimates was the sum of  6,475,000 which,  as mentionedin the preceding paragraph, is  payable from the Fund towards theGeneral  Exchequer Contribution.  The Committee recommendedthat after  allowing for the  payment of this sum the Road Fundpayments should be reduced at least to  20 million  for the years1932-3 and 1933-4.  104.  To save  the sum  of  7,865,000 in the year 1932-3  meantimmediate and drastic retrenchment, and we have been  impressed by the economies made by  Local Authorities and  the Ministry ofTransport  which have  enabled this sum to be saved.   We haveascertained that the payments for the year 1932-33  are now esti-mated  to be  25,950,000 or about  500,000 below the reduced sumof  26,475,000 recommended by the May Committee.
 105. Major  Improvement and New  Construction. We  have[further ascertained  that to effect  these reductions  about 6,750:( hemes of Major Improvement  and New Construction have been reviewed  and  of these about  1,200  have been  postponed whollyor in part.  As a general rule,  where work was  not commenced the scheme was wholly postponed;  where m surveys were in  handarrangements  were  made  for  their completion;  and  wherever possible, works  in progress were stopped at the most economicalpint of termination.  Arrangements were also made  to safeguard,In  the cheapest means, the line of  route of schemes  postponed orcurtailed.  106. In many cases where works have been curtailed, the com-pleted sections  in  themselves constitute valuable improvements.In other cases,  however, only the completion of  the scheme willenable full value to be reaped from the work already done;  butfor the most  part these are large schemes and the  cost of com-completing them  would be so heavy that  in  present  circumstances it could not be justified. Although circumstances make it necessarythat some of these works should be left in  an unfinished state, webelieve that Local Authorities  can be relied upon to see  that stepswill be taken to obviate the danger of deterioration from weather orother causes  until work can be  resumed.  107. In the case of contract works, concerted action by the LocalAuthority and  the  Ministry of  Transport  has  generally resultedin  the postponement  of the work without  undue loss by way ofcompensation  to contractors. We were informed that contractors asa whole have co-operated in  the efforts made to  reduce expendi-itue, and their appreciation of  the financial position has  helpedconsiderably to bring about reasonable settlements  of claims arisingfrom the closing down of works.  108. Altogether the  reductions effected in works of Major Im-provement and  New  Construction  up  to  the 31st  March,  1932,amounted to  about   34J million in total  estimated expenditure for Great Britain.    Of this total,  works in  England and Walesaccount  for  31i million, representing reductions  in  the  road fund  liabilities of approximately  223,- million, and  in  the  LocalAuthorities&apos; liabilities  of  approximately  9  million.  As  works of this character take several years to  complete, the  reductions inliabilities represent savings in  prospective expenditure spread over three or four years.9 C- OsJ O &amp; 109.  Maintenance and Elinor Improvement of Classified  roads and Bridges. We have also ascertained that the County  Councils  16766                                                   C -1
in England and Wales in collaboration with the Minister of Trans-port have reduced their estimates of expenditure during the current year  on the Maintenance and Minor Improvement  of  ClassifiedRoads and  Bridges  by approximately   1,900,000 representing a saving of  800,000 to Highway Authorities and  1,100,000 to theRoad Fund.  110. Salaries of Highway Surveyors and  Engineers. In view ofthe urgent  need  for a reduction in public  expenditure and of the sacrifices which  various classes of public servants were called uponto make by way  of reductions in their emoluments, the government decided that in  determining the amount of the grants to be made from the Road Fund in respect of the salaries of Highway  Surveyorsand  Engineers for the year 1931-32, regard should be had to theextent to which  appropriate reductions in  such salaries  had beenmade by the Local Authority concerned in the light of the reductions in the salaries of officers in other  branches of the  Public Service.Accordingly, on  the 28th September, 1931, Circular Letter No. 367(Roads) was issued to all Highway  Authorities, with the  resultthat  reductions  have  been made  which,  in respect of  Englandand  Wales, will  effect a saving of about  60,000, divided equally between the Road Fund and the rates.  This  saving covers only those cases  where a grant is  made by the Ministry of Transporttowards the salaries  of the Highway Surveyors or Engineers,  and does not include any reduction in  the salaries  of  Highway Sur-veyors or Engineers  made as part of a general salary  reduction byLocal Authorities who do not take such grants from the Ministry.                3. Economies already Effected.  111. The reductions mentioned in the preceding paragraphs relateto expenditure assisted by grants from the Road Fund.  Concern-ing this expenditure we had before us  data  which enabled theextent,  of  the savings  to  be  determined with some degree ofaccuracy.  But for other classes  of expenditure  not assisted bygrants  from  the Road  Fund we have  found  some difficulty inascertaining the extent of the economies  which have been effected.  112. The latest year for which complete figures of highway ex-penditure are available  is 1930-31,  but  as expenditure  on main-tenance and  minor improvement has tended  to become  stabilisedduring the past few years, we feel justified in regarding the actual expenditure incurred  in  the year 1930-31 as a basic figure for thepurpose of estimating the savings proposed to be effected duringthe current year on this  class of-work.

It includes   the expenditure in respect of 994 per cent, of the mileage of roads in England   and Wales.   It is based generally on &quot; income and expenditure,&quot; but is not   altogether uniform in this respect as some of the smaller Authorities&apos; accounts   are still based on &quot; Cash receipts and payments.&quot;  The allocation of figures   must in any case be regarded as approximate especially as the return for the   year is the first of its kind and there may be errors or misunderstandings on the   part of the individual Authorities in tho treatment of particular items.To enable  the position to  be  more  readily  visualised  we makethe following  observations  under headings corresponding to thosein the statement :--

Counties : The actual expenditure undei this    heading in 1930-31 was  13,388,039.  The estimates for 1932-33 provide for a total    expenditure of  approximately  12,800,000    which is approximately 121  per cent, less    than the total of the estimates for 1931-32.  The actual expenditure  on this class of work    generally proves to  be  approximately 10    per cent, less than the estimate and  it may    therefore be assumed that, the  actual  ex-    penditure represented by the estimate of     12,800,000   will    be    approximately     11,500,000, or  a saving in  1932-33 as    compared  with 1930-31 of  approximately    1,900,000London and  County Boroughs.  The actual expenditure  under this heading in    1930-31  was  2,340,860.  So  far as can be ascertained the measure of    reduction contemplated in London and the    County  Boroughs approximates to  that    proposed  in the  County areas.

Counties :  The actual expenditure under this    heading  in  1930-31 was  12,550,100.  Although estimates for  the current year are    not  available,  statements  furnished by    County  Councils  of  their estimated  total    expenditure on highways  show  that  after    deducting  the estimated  expenditure on    major improvement works still  in progress    and the estimated reduced  expenditure on    the maintenance and minor improvement    of classified roads, the balance will only     permit  of  a smaller expenditure  on the     maintenance of unclassified roads than was     incurred in 1930-31.    In the absence of     detailed  information it  is   difficult  to     estimate the reduction, but so far as can     be ascertained it will be not less than 10     per cent. ; on this  basis  there will  be a     saving over 1930-31  of approximately

So  far as  can  be ascertained the  same      measure  of reduction  is  proposed as for      the maintenance and minor improvement      of classified roads in these areas.

Major Improvements and  New Construction.    This work is for  the most part carried out      with  assistance  from  the  Road Fund.      Accordingly the extent  to which  provision      was  originally  made in the  estimates of      the Road Fund is a reliable  guide to the      amount of improvement work contemplated      during the present and succeeding years.    It has been previously explained that  it has      been decided to postpone work of improve-      ment and new construction in England and      Wales estimated to cost  31,500,000.    It is estimated that of this sum the amount      which was originally proposed to be spent      during the current year and is now to be      saved is approximately     .........   9,600,000III. Cleansing  and   Watering  of  Streets  and      Gullies, etc.    The actual expenditure incurred under  this      heading    in    1930-31   amounted   to       4,219,275.    The work covered  by  this  heading is in      essence a sanitary service and is dealt with      in paragraph 149 of our Report.              ..............O SJ u
    IV. Administrative and  other  general  expenses.                                                     Estimated                                                      savings.        Out  of  a total of  56,650,620 returned  by          Highway  Authorities  as   expended  on          highways account in 1930-31 the sum of           2,697,582 is allocated to &quot;  Administrative          and  other  general  expenses.&quot;   But  as          between  Highway  Authorities  there   is          considerable divei-gence  oi  practice  in          allocating these expenses in  the highway          accounts, this  sum must not be taken as          the total of the  administrative  costs  re-          lating to highway expenditure.        Bearing  in  mind  the  extent  to   which          improvement work has  been closed  down          and  maintenance work  is  to be reduced          and  taking into  account  the  reductions          which have been made in salaries we have          estimated a saving  in expenditure under          this  heading of upwards of     ......     200,000      The total  of the   estimated  reductions detailed  in  thisparagraph is   13,900,000  during the current year.                    4. Further  Economies.          (1) MAINTENANCE  AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS.  114. The standard of maintenance  of the roads and bridges inEngland and Wales which, on  the basis of the expenditure in-curred in  1930-31, has been costing about  32,500,000 per annum,is a matter  which has received our close attention, and we  havereached the conclusion that the general standard is  so high that itmight well form the subject of reconsideration.  We are  mindfulof the requirements of public  safety and the need for obviating unduewear and tear of vehicles as a factor in securing economic transport,but we feel that further savings in expenditure on road maintenancecan be effected without  impairing  the efficiency of our  highwaysystem.   115. We would observe that included in the cost of road mainten-ance is a substantial sum for what is termed minor improvement.In the  estimates  for the  maintenance and minor  improvement ofclassified  roads in County areas, minor improvement work  accounts for upwards  of 40 per cent,  of the total expenditure.  This money is spent on improving the  road surface  and frequently on strengthen-ing the road  foundations with the intention of lengthening the life ofthe road.    The present  financial  situation of the country, in ourview, demands  some further reduction in this class of expenditure
9 9 rr  o J       (2) MAJOR IMPROVEMENT AND NEW CONSTRUCTION.  117. We have already dealt at length with the steps taken to re-luce  expenditure  on major improvements.  The drastic retrench-inent in  Road Fund Expenditure already effected means not only that so far as the Road Fund is concerned practically no new road and bridge improvement schemes can be commenced, but that manyimprovements  recently in  progress must remain suspended.   Foralthough the expenditure on schemes now being completed will  beless each year, the Road Fund will have to repay to  the Treasurybetween 1936 (or earlier if  earlier repayment proves practicable) and1911, a sum of about  8,750,000, being  6,000,000 voted  by  Parlia-ment in the year 1931-32 and  2,750,000 voted for the year 1932-33to enable the Fund to meet its commitments.  The Fund also hasto meet interest on these advances until they are liquidated.  118. We have ascertained that the estimates of the Road fund for the current year provide for a Road Fund Expenditure of about &quot;200,000 on new works of improvement, and it is already apparent that this sum will prove inadequate to deal with emergency schemesresulting from physical causes, e.g., collapsed bridges, or  for widen-ing roads and bridges at an economical time where  the opportunityto carry out a necessary improvement may not recur for  some long period.during the next few years.   While appreciating  that reductionshave already been made,  we think that they have been  achievedpartly by  recent  reductions in labour costs  and falling  prices ofmaterials,  and not entirely by the postponement of work.  TakingI he country  as a whole the downward adjustment of wages shouldhave been responsible for  considerable reductions in road expendi-uire, as labour costs constitute one of the principal-items.  116. We have previously mentioned that the reductions already made in the estimates for maintenance and minor improvement ofclassified and unclassified roads and bridges show a total  saving ofapproximately  4,100,000  as  compared with the  expenditure in-ciirred in  1930-31.   These reductions vary as between individual authorities; in some cases the reductions are substantial;  in othersthey are negligible or non-existent.   We are satisfied that  by  afurther careful scrutiny of their estimates, Highway Authorities can make additional savings amounting  to upwards of  2,000,000 perannum, which  should bring the total reductions on work of main-tenance and  minor improvement to not less than  6,000,000 perannum as  compared with the expenditure in 1930-31. In our opinion the reductions  should apply  generally  to  classified roads and un-classified roads, subject to a reasonable amount of elasticity to meetthe varying circumstances in particular localities, and can be broughtabout by a  general slowing down in the process  of strengtheningroad foundations  and improving road surfaces.  Tf this is done wedo  not anticipate that the reduced expenditure will result in any  tbstantial accumulation of arrears.
  119. We have previously referred to the reductions estimated at 9,600,000 which have  already  been made in the current year.,estimates for major improvements, but there is a substantial amountof work continuing to completion, and we think there may be someschemes on which expenditure could be further reduced or deferred.We  therefore recommend  that Local Authorities should make yet another survey of the works  of major improvement and new con-struction now in progress to see if any additional savings can bemade.                 (3) METHODS AND MANAGEMENT.  120. Hitherto we have dealt with the restriction of work.  We didnot think that our recommendations  should end  there, but that weshould consider the problems continuously confronting Local Aulho-rities  concerning  management   and  the methods  employed  incarrying out works.  121. From our experience of Local Government we are satisfiedthat considerable savings can be  made by the more general applica-tion of modern methods, e.g., by the  introduction of costing systemswherever possible, and by frequent  periodical comparisons of  unitcosts.  We consider that in this respect Highway Authorities might with advantage review their administrative machinery.  122. Highway  Authorities who employ contractors  for the resur-facing of roads and similar work are sometimes reluctant to throwthe work open to public tender.   We consider that the practice of advertising   publicly for  tenders should normally  be  followed.Where an Authority has a Works Department  of  its own for this class of work, we  consider that with a  view  to testing and main-taining  the  efficiency of  the Department, public tenders  shouldperiodically  be invited  and that the Works Department should berequired to tender on the same basis  as anyone else.   123.  We also consider that there should be a more frequent exami-nation of expenditure on staff, with the object  of securing reductionswhere  changed circumstances  and  conditions may  have resultedin decreased responsibilities and less administrative work.                  (4) HEAVY TRAFFIC ON ROADS.   124.  In our opinion  a permanent  reduction in highway expendi-ture will be secured if  there is  a diminution in the weight of in- dividual  vehicles  using  the roads  (more   particularly  the im-classified roads) and a more rapid conversion of heavy vehicles from solid to pneumatic tyres.   The  Minister of Transport has  made Regulations  (under thepowers conferred upon him by the Road Traffic Act) governing the maximum laden weights of motor  vehicles and  trailers, and  the maximum weights to be transmitted to the road surface by any part or parts of such vehicles;  speed limits are imposed by the Act for all classes of vehicles other than private cars and motor cycles.
o n- ct*J   o  The  objects  of  the  requirements  as  to maximum  speeds and maximum laden weights for heavy motor vehicles are the  safety ofthe public, both from the point of view of the persons carried on the vehicle and of other users of the highway, and economy in highwaycosts in view of the damage caused to road surfaces by heavily ladenvehicles travelling at high speeds.  Heavy vehicles travelling at fastspeeds  also cause considerable damage to property adjacent to the highway, and the property  owner  is without a remedy for the damage done.  There  can be no doubt  that in  many cases vehicles subjectto speed  limits and  weight limits are being used deliberately andconsistently with  excessive weights  and at excessive  speeds, and where it has been found practicable to take proceedings successfullythe fines imposed by Magistrates as a general  rule appear to be  aninsufficient deterrent.  125.  Under Section  27 of the Road Traffic Act the responsibilityfor checking laden weights rests primarily on the Highway Authori-ties.   They may  authorise  suitable  persons,  e.g., inspectors  ofweights  and  measures, or  police   constables  through  a  police authority, or a chief officer  of police, to act on their behalf.  Anyperson authorised in  that behalf by a Highway  Authority may require the  driver of  a vehicle  suspected  of  being overloaded totake the vehicle to  be weighed  at  a weighbridge,  subject  to the highway Authority being liable to pay compensation if the vehicleis taken  a distance  of more than one  mile  for this purpose andon  being weighed is found  to be within the  legal  limits.   Thereis, unfortunately,  a  considerable scarcity of weighbridges suitablefor weighing the  heavier types of vehicles, and this renders anyclose check difficult.   The Minister  of  Transport has urged LocalAuthorities  to  instal  weighbridges,  and  has  offered  grants fromthe Road Fund in approved cases at  the  rate of 50 per cent, towardsthe cost of installation.  We  wish to  emphasise the  need  for  more  effective  operation by  Highway Authorities generally,  of  the powers  conferred upon them by the Road Traffic  Act to check  the laden weights of heavy-motor  vehicles, as we  are  satisfied that  this would  result in a con-siderable saving in highway  expenditure.  .126. The Report of  the Conference on Rail  and Road Transport,recently issued, contains two proposals which  have  a direct  bearing on  this problem of the improper use of the highway by  heavily-laden vehicles, viz.  (1)  the  prohibition, on a more  extensive scale,of the use of  lightly  constructed minor roads by  heavy vehicles,and (2)  the carrying  by goods vehicles  of a log  book, or record ofthe journey showing the weight and nature of the load carried,  the working time of the drivers, etc.  We agree with these proposals.
so                   (5) EXPERIMENTAL  WORK.  127. We consider that the problem of effecting further permanentreductions in highway costs is largely dependent  on the  extent towhich more economical methods of construction and better use ofmaterials can be shown to be possible.  We are of  opinion  thatthe Ministry of Transport should continue  and develop its experi-mental work.  128. We  desire  to  express the  view  that  should  statutoryeffect be  given to  the proposals  of  the Conference  on  Rail anilEoad Transport for additional taxation of commercial goods vehiclesusing the highway, any further  revenue  that  may  he received,together with  any  saving accruing to  the Road Fund  from thereduction  effected in Highway expenditure should not be diverted to other channels but  should be devoted to the assistance of High-way Authorities,&apos; including County Boroughs,  in  the form of in-creased grants in order to diminish the call  upon the ratepayer.                        CHAPTER V.                    PUBLIC HEALTH.                        1. Introductory.  129. The  Public Health  Services  which  we  consider  in  this chapter include sewerage and sewage disposal, refuse collection and disposal, street  cleansing,  mental hospitals and mental deficiencyservices, but exclude  the  school medical  service,  and institutionsunder the control of Public Assistance Committees, which are con-sidered  in Chapters II and VI respectively.      In  the time at our disposal we have  obviously been unable toexamine in  close detail  the many important services included  inthis range and for the most part we have  had to confine ourselves to pointing  out matters of which  we think  detailed  investigation is necessary.  130.  Not  only is an efficient public health service a matter ofnational importance :  in certain of its  aspects it makes a strongappeal  to human interest  and sympathy.  None the less, these considerations cannot  be any warrant for  lack of care in adminis-tration  or for  the  absence of strict business methods in  the ex-penditure of public money.  Becent legislation has greatly extendedthe scope  of the public health services we  may cite the notification of Births Acts, 1907  and  1915, the Maternity and Child WelfareAct, 1918,  the Midwives  Acts, 1902 to 1926, the Public  Health(Tuberculosis)  Act, 1921, the Blind Persons Act, 1920, the  MentalTreatment  Act, 1930, and  the Mental Deficiency Acts,  1913 to1927.   This legislation  necessarily increases  the  duties of Local
Authorities and the burden on the taxpayer; and large reductions in public health expenditure could be secured only&quot; by a reversal ofpolicy.   It  is not  our province to question  the  propriety of  theprovision which has been made by Parliament in these and similarActs, but  we consider that  the recent development  of the health services  has been too rapid  to permit of  their organisation in  themost efficient and economical manner, and it may be  that a breath-ing space for review, even if this should mean more gradual attain-nient of desirable ends, would prove to be in the interests of  theservices  themselves as well as  of administrative efficiency.  131. The proposals we make in this Chapter are not made solelyas temporary measures of retrenchment to be adopted to meet apassing  period  of  financial stringency;  our intention is also tosuggest ways in which the health  services of the Country can beprovided, in normal times, at  substantially less cost.   It is difficultto evaluate in terms of  money services necessary to preserve, ordesigned to improve,  the national  health,  and none of our sugges-tions tends to reduce any service of real value to public health.  132. We have examined the following services  :       (1)  sewerage and sewage disposal,  refuse collection and  dis-    posal, street cleansing, parks and pleasure grounds, etc., baths    and washhouses, and infectious diseases hospitals, all  of which    are  administered by Sanitary  Authorities;      (2)  mental hospitals,  mental deficiency institutions and  the    tuberculosis and venereal diseases services, administered  by    Councils of Counties and  County Boroughs;      (3)  maternity and  child welfare,  administered  by County    and County Borough Councils,  and also by a  number of smaller    Authorities.  133. The nature of all but the first three of these  services make sit peculiarly difficult to find  suitable  statistical  measures of their efficiency.   We have examined a considerable number of costingand other returns  relating  to  the  various services, but withoutdetailed  knowledge  of local conditions it is impossible  to -makeprecise comparisons  between  Local Authorities.  We have, how-ever, satisfied ourselves on two general points, which we  elaboratein the body of the Chapter.  134. In the first place, within the present framework of the health services  there is room for substantial economies  which can besecured by closer administration.  The variations between the unitcosts of Authorities  working prima facie  under similar conditions,for the same purpose and with no apparent difference in the results,are  so wide that it appears  unreasonable, without  close inquiry,to accept them as necessary variations due to  differing local circum-stances.   For example, two  County Boroughs of  populations 90,000
and  70,000  respectively,  approximately  of the  same  degree ofindustrialism, spent over a  period of five years on infant welfareservice average amounts of  630 and  2,360 respectively per 1,000births.  The average infantile  mortality  rate for  the same period was  57 in the former  and 72  in the latter.  Again, the costs ofmaintenance per patient per week of two  mental deficiency institii-tions, each maintained by the Council of  a large County Borough,each with rather more than 200 inmates,  were in 1930-31 65s. 10d.and 16s. 4d. respectively.   If loan charges  are neglected the  rates are 46s. 9d. and  14s. 3d.  On a smaller scale, the same  anomaly isshown in two  mental hospitals in the  same County, built in thesame year and with approximately the same number of inmates;in 1931-32 the expenditure  on  fuel  in  one was rather  more thantwice that of the other institution.  Many other examples could begiven.  We do not contend that- such figures in themselves proveanything; we do say that they need investigation.  135. More generally, examination  of  the  figures available make sit clear that  there  is  no  obvious relation  in  the health sendeesgenerally  between expenditure and results, and suggests that  theremay be  some  need to  point o.ut  that  an  efficient  service  is notsecured merely by spending money on it.  136. Secondly, there seem to us to be a few services which modernmedical opinion  considers to be obsolete  or obsolescent, either bychange&apos; in the circumstances to  which they were directed  whenthey were instituted or by advances in medical knowledge.   such services tend  to  be continued  out of habit and from pressure ofpublic opinion.   We suggest In a subsequent paragraph that  these services should be terminated as soon as is  compatible with a reason-able regard for public opinion.  137. Prom what we  have already  said,  it will be realised that itis not possible to make any definite estimate of the saving whichcould be  obtained by a  general  increase in the  administrativeefficiency of the health  services.  We have been able to make roughestimates of the possible  saving in individual  services, but eventhese figures have necessarily been based on assumptions and roughbalancing of probabilities.  We do not  put them  forward as morethan indications of the order of magnitude of the savings which weconsider could  be obtained.  13S. We note that the expenditure per 1,000 ofthe population on public health services  in the ten years previous to 1929-30 showed a general tendency to decrease from 1921 to 1923 or 1924 and there-after  a general  tendency to increase in spite of the fall in prices which continued  throughout the period.  We assume that the initialdecrease of expenditure  was the  result  of general restriction ofexpenditure in the earlier years and that the subsequent increase i;
in part due to the gradual relaxation of the efforts for economy, tothe effect of changes in national policy and to works undertaken toprovide relief for  unemployment.  In any event, it is clear thatno saving to  the ratepayer has followed from the continued fall inprices.  139.  The figures given in this Chapter are with one or two excep-tions those for 1929-30, the last year for which  complete returns are available.  It should be noted that in 1929-30 the block grantsystem had  not  been introduced and  that percentage grants, nowmerged in the general block grants, were paid towards  the cost of several health services.  140.  In the following paragraphs, dealing with particular services,we have shown  the Authorities  by whom the service is adminis-tered, and the expenditure  on the service in the year 1929-30.  141.  As indicated in paragraph 132, the services fall broadly  into three  groups.   The  first of these  is administered by  SanitaryAuthorities,  of  which there  are  1,806, comprising 83  Countyborough Councils, the Corporation of the City of  London  and the28 Metropolitan Borough Councils, 266 Municipal Borough Councils,784 Urban District Councils, and 644 Rural  District Councils. the populations of the Urban areas vary from over 1,000,000 to 251  andthose of the Rural Districts from 82,000  to  930.   County Councils(excluding London), who administer for  the  whole or part of their areas the services in the second and third groups number 61 : theirpopulations  range from 1,800,000 to 17,000.      2. Services Administered by  Sanitary Authorities.  142. (1)  SEWERAGE AND  SEWAGE  DISPOSAL.    (All Urban  andsome Rural Authorities.)                    Expenditure  1929-30.

We under-stand also that the Ministry of Health  take steps  to  secure thatwhen a Local Authority applies for sanction  to a loan to carry outsewerage  or  sewage  disposal works, sanction is  not issued unless
the proposals are such as to secure efficient and economical work-ing.  We  suggest, however, that there are indications that un-necessary expenditure on sewerage schemes is incurred by LocalAuthorities who provide their own sewerage system and disposalworks  when by combination with  neighbouring Authorities  theywould  avoid expensive multiplication of small schemes and securethat disposal works are centralised so far  as is economically andtechnically  sound.   We understand that  when an  Authority hasapplied for sanction to  a loan for the provision of an  independentsewerage scheme the sanction of the Minister has sometimes beenwithheld, except on condition of  such  co-operation with adjoiningAuthorities, either  by the formation of Joint Drainage Boards orby  arrangements made in  pursuance of section 28  of the  PublicHealth Act, 1875,  as may be required  for economy  and efficiency.We recommend that this procedure should be  followed whereversuch arrangements  can be made.   Co-operation of this kind between a small Authority  and  a larger should  not  of itself be consideredan  argument for the absorption  of the smaller area.  143. The building of houses outside the range of existing seweragesystems  frequently  results  in insanitary  conditions and compelsthe Authority either to extend their sewerage systems at  a costwholly disproportionate to the rateable value of the  dwellings con-cerned  or  to undertake the  regular emptying of cesspools.  Wecall attention to the provisions, in sections 12 and 19 (1) (e) of theTown  and  Country Planning Act, 1932, under which  provisionsmay be included  in a planning  scheme  for the  control of  suchbuilding.  144. We are informed that the  Ministry of Health have recently introduced  a system of  costing for sewage  disposal works  with  aview to applying, as far as possible, to this service the proceduredescribed in the  following paragraph.  We note  the step  with satisfaction, and we anticipate that as  a result of a closer study ofadministration  it should be possible to secure a reduction of 5 percent, on the costs of maintenance.  145.

 We are informed  that  since  the  formation of the  Ministry of ealth special attention has heen paid to the possibility of reducingbe costs of this  service.   We  concur wholly in the  view of the jpurtment that  the service  is particularly suitable  for  running a  costing basis and that any private concern with a fraction of e annual expenditure involved would be a large business in whichjder modern conditions detailed costing returns would be regarded8j an essential.  We are  the  more  surprised to learn  that certain!jf the large urban areas in the Country have as yet taken  no steps , organise this service on a  proper  and businesslike basis. Hi;. The general principles upon  which  the  organisation of this nice has proceeded are  set out in  a Report on the collection andcsposal  of refuse and street  cleansing  by  Local Authorities inEngland and Wales, published by the Ministry of Health  in 1925,Sjnd  have  been dealt  with in  successive Annual Reports  of theMinistry.   It is clear that economy in this service is secured by keeping  regular and accurate records of its cost, the examination of ninthly detailed  costs of  the  service and  immediate  inquiry into ay rise in costs.   It is essential that records of the quantity  of efuse handled  should be  based on actual weighing,  not  on pure stirnates. 117. In areas with a population exceeding 75,000 it  is important hat  special consideration  should  be given to the  organisation f i he  refuse  and   cleansing  services.    The  Report  of the jpartmental conference   of  1925,   mentioned  in  the  preceding aiagraph, and the returns received from areas where the  recom-nended  system has been adopted  show  that  financial  advantageresults from proper  organisation  on the  lines suggested.  Weunderstand that  up  to  the present  though any  Authority maykeep the return, costing returns of  this work have not been askedlor by the Ministry from Authorities of less than 30,000  population and we suggest that the Department  should  consider the reductionof this limit, or  alternatively  that  records  in  the  degree requiredby local circumstances should  be kept by all Authorities  and thatthe Department  should consider providing  for  the use  of smallAuthorities a simpler record than that issued to the larger.  Thisrecord would  be primarily for their own  use in  organising this service and not necessarily to be returned  to the Department.   Inthe  small  areas  the  cleansing and  refuse  disposal work mustnecessarily form  part of the  duties  of  the Surveyor or  SanitaryInspector.   We have  been told that the information available  onthis  subject in the Department will be placed at the  disposal ofany  such officer who is interested in the  subject and desires advice.We  suggest also  the Associations of Local Authorities should take steps to call the attention of Authorities of the smaller areas to theimportance of this subject. 148. Refuse  must  not  be considered merely  as  useless material to be got rid  of  as  cheaply as possible.

While an Authority  may be  justified  inacquiring land  for  this purpose  where the postponement of  pur-chase  might mean a large increase of cost, or the loss of the open space, it should  be  borne  in mind that the acquisition  of the landdoes not necessarily involve large expenditure on  elaborate lay-contributory on  the salaries of officers.

(6) Attention  to possible  methods of  equalising as  far  as    possible the necessarily varying load on  the  equipment.      (c) Review of the charges made to the public.      (d) Encouraging the use of swimming bath accommodation    during  the winter by letting for other piuposes.      In particular  the  charges for use  of washhouses  should    be re-considered and  steps taken to prevent their use  by pro-    fessional washerwomen.  In some  areas the  standard of accommodation is unnecessarilycostly  and  the  provision made  goes  beyond  what  is  reasonably necessary.   We  consider  that there  is  no necessity  for  a LocalAuthority to provide baths other than swimming and slipper baths.The general considerations set out in paragraphs 182 and  183  ofthis Report should be borne in mind  in future building.

It appears to us that the provision  of  a number of smallindependent isolation hospitals,  each  serving  for  all  purposescomparatively  small area,  leads  to waste of effort  and of moneyGreater efficiency and economy would be secured if small hospitaauthorities would co-operate, classify the isolation  accommodatioiavailable in  their several districts and arrange  for its  use to servthe  whole area  of  the  districts.  The  varying prevalence of in-fectious disease in different parts of  the larger area will ensure amore constant use  of :the  provision  made than is  possible whereeach  hospital  serves  only  a limited district.  The necessary co-operation may be arranged either through the County Council orby the  establishment on a voluntary basis of a Committee repre-senting the  several  hospital authorities  in  a comparatively large area.  In either case the  duty of the  central  body would be theco-ordination of  the  accommodation   available  to  secure,  forexample,  that  when a  diphtheria ward  is open  in one district adiphtheria ward of the hospital  in an adjoining district is not openedfor sporadic cases of diphtheria until  the accommodation in thefirst district is fully used.   The better  use  made of the availablehospitals may  in some  cases make  it  possible to discontinue thuse of some  of the smaller  hospitals.  Provision for action on theseilines, under the general control of  the  County Council, is made!in Section  63 of the Local Government Act, 1929,  and we recom-mend that steps should be taken to give effect to the  intention of sub-section  3 (a) of the section, which  is designed to secure themore efficient use of existing accommodation.

It appears  to us that  the  provision of- a  number of smallindependent isolation hospitals, each serving for  all purposes acomparatively small  area, leads to waste  of effort  and of money.Greater efficiency and economy  would be  secured if small  hospital authorities would co-operate, classify the  isolation  accommodation available in their several districts  and arrange for its use  to serve the whole area  of  the  districts.   The  varying  prevalence of in-fectious disease in different parts  of  the larger area will ensure amore  constant use of the  provision  made than is  possible whereeach  hospital serves only  a limited district.

In either case the duty  of  the central body w*ould be theco-ordination  of  the  accommodation  available  to  secure,  forexample,  that when a diphtheria  ward is open  in one district adiphtheria ward of the hospital in an adjoining district is not openedfor sporadic cases of diphtheria, until  the accommodation in thefirst district is fully used.   The better  use made of the availablehospitals  may in some  cases  make it possible to discontinue theuse of some of the smaller hospitals.  Provision for action  on theselines, under the general control of the County  Council,  is madein Section 63 of the Local Government  Act, 1929,  and we reconi-mend that steps should be taken to give effect to the intention of sub-section  3 (a) of the section, which is designed to secure themore  efficient use  of existing  accommodation.
  156.  The general considerations set  out in paragraphs 182 and183 in regard to the standard  of institutional provision apply toisolation  hospitals.   Comparative costs of maintenance for  isola-tion  hospitals are not  published by  the Ministry  of Health onaccount of the varying nature, incidence  and duration  of epidemicsand  the  disparity in the extent  to  which  different hospitals arein use  during any one year.  157.  We are  advised  that,  when  new  accommodation is  pro-vided, cubicle blocks  should be given an important place.   Withtrained  nursing  staff  they  obviate  the  opening  of wards, forsporadic cases of infectious disease.  158.  (a) Smallpox. The hospital for the treatment of smallpoxis provided largely as an insurance against an emergency.   It is,therefore, particularly important  that  the risk should  be  spreadover  as large an area as possible.   In other words,  the general principle  that it  is more economical for small areas to combinefor  the  provision of a  large residential unit  than  for each toprovide a small uneconomical residential institution  applies withparticular force to the provision of a smallpox hospital.  hospital authorities should therefore consider  carefully how far any  special provision  which they have made for smallpox could  be disposed ofor converted  to  other  use  by co-operation  with other hospital authorities.  159.  (b) Scarlet Fewer.-The Ministry of Health  issued in 1927a Eeport  on some Administrative  Aspects of Scarlet  Fever (No.&apos; 35of Reports on. Public Health and Medical Subjects),  to which, inour view, insufficient  attention  has  been paid.  &apos; The authors ofthat  Report concluded  that there is  no reason for prescribing aroutine period of detention in hospital of more  than 4 weeks inuncomplicated cases of  scarlet  fever.  The  statistics  available asto the effect of longer detention on the number of return cases are carefully  examined in the Report and provide nothing to suggestthat  an extension of the routine period of detention has any  effecton the  number of return cases or  on the  incidence of,  or mortalityfrom, the disease.   We  have  no precise information  as  to theextent to which  the conclusions of this Report have been adopted,but. it is  sufficiently clear that  there are many districts in  whicha longer  routine  period  of  detention is  habitual than appears tobe necessary..  While the  longer period of  detention may  havebeen properly adopted  as  a precaution  at  the  time  when themortality from  scarlet  fever was heavy, we consider  that the seriousness of this disease has wholly altered in  the last 50  yearsand that  the  former procedure  is now followed rather from  habitthan from any medical  necessity.  160.  We think that  the  saving to  be secured by adoption  ofthe conclusions  of the  1927 Report  would  be of the order of  120,000 per annum.
no  161. Careful consideration  should  also he given  to the questionwhether mild cases of scarlet  fever  might not  be dealt with athome, when  the home  conditions permit, reserving removal to hospital for the more serious  cases.  This procedure is followed ina number of areas and its general adoption would provide a  furthersmall saving in expenditure on isolation.  162.  (c) Terminal disinfection. The question of disinfection ofhouses after scarlet fever is  dealt with in  the  same Report,  andwe  have received independent  evidence that both  in scarlet feverand in diphtheria, if proper procedure is adopted during  the courseof the disease,  the terminal disinfection  has little medical value and is performed largely out of deference to public opinion.   Werecommend that Sanitary Authorities,  in consultation  with  theirmedical  officers  of  health,  should take  steps  to  educate publicopinion in this matter and  discontinue such  of their present ex-penditure on  disinfection as has  no medical value.  The savingwhich would  result from a general adoption of this recommenda-tion is more difficult to estimate,  but is not likely to be less than 100,000.3.

We finda strong and  widely held view that the Board of Control requiretoo  elaborate  and expensive a standard of construction  for mental hospitals.  There is on the other hand  evidence that Local Authori-ties  themselves  have put forward proposals for  expenditure far beyond what  is necessary.  We consider  (1) that the standards of accommodation required by the Board of Control should be modi-tied  to secure economy,  and  (2) that sanction should  be refused
to  schemes  of  Local  Authorities  which  exceed  the  modifiedstandards.   It  appears to  us further that much of the uneasiness(oil  regarding  mental services  might  be allayed  if the  functionsot the Board of Control were restricted to considering and advisingon specialist questions relating to the treatment of mental disease,and  their administrative duties discharged, like the central adminis-tration  of  other  health services, by a  staff forming an integral part of  the Ministry of Health  establishment 164.  We have  considered  how  far  further  building  of  mental hospitals may  be avoided  by reserving the  hospitals more  strictlyfor persons in need of mental treatment.  In paragraph 214 we ex-press the opinion that there are in many mental hospitals a numberof harmless senile patients who  could be suitably  treated either intheir homes or in institutions less expensive than  mental hospitalssuch as Public Assistance  Institutions.  Figures relating to institu-lions of the West  Biding of Yorkshire Mental  Hospitals  Boardshow the number of such persons to be over five per cent,  of thetotal number of  inmates.   We recommend  that,  before  it is  con-eluded  that  further accommodation in mental hospitals is  neces-sary, steps should be taken to remove persons who can be  adequatelytreated  elsewhere.   Similar considerations  apply  to mental defect-tives who  have been admitted to hospitals for mental  treatment and who have not been removed from the hospital when temporarymental  disease has  been cured.   We note  that reference is madeto this class on page 8 of  the current Report of the Board of  Con-trol, as well as to the too-ready practice of certifying mental defect-tives under the Lunacy Act of 1890.  165.  We consider that it is important to  the welfare  of patients in mental hospitals, and that it promotes their cure, to provide themwith occupation.  We suggest that it  is financially important thatthis  occupation  should, to  the extent permitted  by  the  circum-stances of the hospital, provide a proper financial return.  166.  The duties of  the  Council in regard  to  mental  hospitals aredischarged through the Visiting Committee which is in some mattersindependent of the financial control applied by the Finance Com-niittee  to  the  administration of the other health services  of theCouncil.  We  see no ground for the preservation of this anomaly,certainly not since the passing of the Local  Government  Act of1929, and  recommend strongly that the Committee responsible formental hospitals  should be on  precisely the same footing as anyother Committee of the  Council.   In the case of Joint VisitingCommittees of which there are  a number throughout the country,the  principle  that  the  responsible  constituent Authorities  shouldbe enabled to  exercise a proper measure of financial control oughtequally to apply; with this safeguard, to remove  a difficulty whichmight  arise, that where the  constituent  Authorities  are  not inagreement  as to the financial proposals of  a Joint Committee, the
matter should be referred to the Minister of Health, whose deeisiotshould be final.  We suggest  also that the removal of the anomalireferred to would facilitate the co-ordination of poor law and me-ntjhospital accommodation referred to in paragraph 164.  167.

We call special attention to this  service.   With  increase)ascertainment of mental defectives, its cost, per 1,000 of the popultion, has increased from. 14.7  in 1920-21 to  24.3 in 1924-25,  32in 1927-28 and  37.9 in 1929-30, the last year for which complefigures  are available.   If this alarming  increase is  not checkedthe financial  consequences will be disastrous.   This  service isits  early stages.   There is  still opportunity to  secure  that suitabprovision  is  made  for mental deficients on  simple and   soiraeconomical lines at a much lower cost than is at present  in contemplation.  169.  The primary purpose of the service should be the  protect!of the public against defectives who may be a danger to the community.  The second should be the maintenance of these and othmental defectives in reasonable circumstances.   In the second pur-pose  it seems to us necessary to consider the claims not  onlythe unfit persons who are unable to  support  themselves but also of the fit, at whose cost they must  be supported.   We think thatthe burden on the fit cannot in equity be much further increased:and that  much  of  the provision recommended by  the  Board oiControl is of  a standard disproportionate to the cost of maintaining the same number of productive fit persons.   We suggest  that thesestandards  should be revised and simplified and, in particular, that

The  Committee do not  question the value for  both prevention and  cure   of  sanatorium  treatment  properly  applied  but  theyare of  opinion that in  some  areas  treatment  in sanatoria isindiscriminately given  to  certain  classes  of  tuberculous personswithout sufficient  care to ensure that  this expensive treatment is used only for persons for whom there is a reasonable expectation of providing a  cure.  173.  We suggest that money and  effort are frequently wastedin giving prolonged periods of sanatorium treatment to persons inthe intermediate stage  of  the disease.   The  class of tuberculouspersons known variously  as  &quot; intermediate,&quot; &quot; T.B. 4- 2 &quot;  or&quot; B2 &quot; is a heterogeneous group and contains a number of personswho respond well  to treatment.  Prolonged and skilled observationis  often necessary before it is possible to  assess the outlook of apatient, and this  skilled assessment of outlook for  the  individualpatient  is of more importance, for the determination of the  kindof treatment to be given, than classification in any  of the categoriesless &quot;elaborate classification should be called for.  It must.be addedthat Local Authorities are by no means free from blame in putting forward extravagant schemes.  170. We are not satisfied  that the figures of  the Report of theWood Committee are sufficiently established to warrant the assump-tion that a certain number of defectives must exist in any givenarea,  or  to  justify a  requirement that Local Authorities  should provide institutional accommodation on a  scale much in advanceof  the actual  ascertainment of defectives.  We feel also that thereis need for greater caution before deciding that a  person is mentallydeficient.  171. We suggest  that  for  higher grade  mental defectives  thegreatest possible  use should be made  of the system  of securingfor such persons employment,  in domestic  service or otherwise,with  suitable employers who are prepared to act as guardians.  172.

used for statistical purposes.  In some patients in this group observa-tion of the results  of treatment in  a  sanatorium  will show  thatquiescence of the disease is not likely to occur.   When  this point&quot;has  been  reached,  there is little  purpose  in  automatically  con-tinuing sanatorium  treatment and the patients should be returnedto hospital or to their homes under the general  supervision of thetuberculosis dispensary, as the progress of the disease or the con-dition of.their  homes may indicate.  We are informed that the records of treatment  given  for  tuberculosis show that insufficientdiscrimination is still exercised  in the selection of  patients  in thisintermediate group  for prolonged periods of sanatorium treatment.   The essential point is  that treatment  should be preceded  by themost accurate diagnosis possible, that the effects of the treatmentshould be carefully  watched, and that prolonged  institutional treat-ment should not be given to persons found  unlikely to be restoredby it, for whom such  relief as they can secure can be more cheaplyprovided.   174. It appears  to us also  that  in  many  areas  children arediagnosed as tuberculous on insufficient evidence  and given pro-longed  periods  of  sanatorium treatment.   A careful  investigationin Lancashire has indicated that approximately half of the childrenup to fifteen years of age who were referred to the  TuberculosisOfficer as being suspected  of suffering  from tuberculosis and werediagnosed as  non-tuberculous, did not, between the ages of  15 and25, return to the Dispensary as definite cases of pulmonary tuber-culosis.   Careful  and conservative diagnosis of  pulmonary  tuber-culosis  in children  would  reduce  the number of sanatorium bedsrequired  for  children with  consequent  saving  of public money.Where tuberculous  disease in the bronchial glands can be definitely established,  institutional treatment is often advisable, whether forcure  or to prevent  serious breakdown in later life.  But here alsowe think that  more  discrimination  and greater care in diagnosisare necessary.   175.  The  possible  saving from  these two recommendations  isdifficult  to estimate,  but  might  be of  the order of  60,000  to 80,000.   176. (4)  VENEREAL DISEASES.

  We have considered to what extent the general conclusions con-iained in paragraph 191 on the recovery of charges are applicableto venereal diseases.  It appears to us that in the interests of publichealth  it is necessary that  free clinics for the treatment of thesediseases should continue to  be provided but  we suggest that where[he  local circumstances permit separate sessions at which fees areiharged should be  held to  meet  the needs of those persons whowould be willing  or who  desire to pay  fees  for the treatment pro-vided.  In scattered areas we suggest as an alternative that selectedpractitioners in the  area should be recognised by the Council or theDepartment as capable of giving adequate treatment, that patientswilling  and able  to  pay  fees  should  be  advised  at  the clinic toreceive further treatment from one of these practitioners and thattiie  practitionei&apos;s  should be  supplied by the Local Authority  withthe  necessary  arseno-benzene compounds.  177. (5) MATERNITY, AND CHILD WELFARE.  (All County Councilsexcept  London,  all  County Borough  Councils,  all  metropolitan borough Councils,   125  Borough  Councils, 124  Urban district councils and 14 Rural  District  Councils).

Net  debt at end of the year(a) Health Visitors.  (The duties of Health Visitors are  not  confined to maternity and child welfare, but  they are most conveniently taken under  this head.)  The  question  has been  raised  whether  it is proper that these officers should receive salaries in excess  of those  paid to hospitalnurses.   We  are informed, however,  that both  the  standard oftraining required and the  cost of the  training are  high  and thatHealth Visitors  are frequently able to  prevent  the development of disease or secure that treatment  is provided in the first  stages of disease which, if it developed,  would require more expensive treat-ment.  In country  districts in particular  they  have to act on theirown  responsibility  to  an extent not required of  a  hospital nurseor sister.  It is essential that this specially trained staff should not 2,402,000   446,000 1,956,000 127,000 646,000
be used on routine duties, but should be employed on work where their  special qualifications  are  necessary  and can  be used to thebest advantages.  (b)  Maternity Homes. (Net expenditure in 1929-30 includinginfants&apos; hospitals and arrangements for treating puerperal fever andophthalmia neonatorum  353,000).  178. We have  been greatly impressed by the wide variations ofmaintenance costs in maternity homes and the obviously  excessivecosts  of the smaller units.  Costs of  6 to  8 per patient  week arenot uncommon and the highest  figure in  1929-30 was  9  15s. perweek, including loan charges.   Such expenditure appears  to  us in-defensible and we suggest that  greater  efficiency  would be secured by providing larger Homes, each covering a large area, or by making arrangements with voluntary hospitals in the area for the admissionof cases requiring special treatment rather than by  making special provision  ad hoc. (c) Infant  Welfare Centres.  179. We are satisfied that these centres provide  a valuable service,but that their advantages are frequently  abused.   Milk and  otherfoods should not  be freely distributed without careful scrutiny, andsome payment,  however  small,  should be required in  all but themost  necessitous  cases.  We consider that the  primary function ofsuch centres should be to provide advice, and that as a general ruletreatment should be provided rather by the ordinary general prac-titioner.    Similarly the work of ante-natal clinics is valuable if itis properly co-ordinated with the midwifery or other maternity ser-vices  so as to secure continuity of treatment.  If, as we are informedis sometimes the case, the information obtained at the ante-natalclinics, is not passed on to the persons under whose care  the con-finement  will take  place, it is  clear that full value is not  being obtained for the  expenditure incurred on the ante-natal  clinics.(d) Day Nurseries.   (Net cost in 1929-30,  32,000.)   180. We  have considered the  high  rate of expenditure on  day-nurseries, amounting in many  cases to 3s.  and upwards  per childper day;  and we note that their purpose has in  recent years  been extended  beyond the original limits of providing for children whosemothers are obliged to engage in daily work which takes them away from  home, or who are temporarily in distress.  We think that this service should be strictly  limited to the purpose for which  it was originally intended, that the cost per child per day should not exceed2s. 6d.,  and that  a substantial  proportion of  the  cost should beobtained  from the parent.
9 $ rDid                          4.  General.                  (1) INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT.  181.  The cost of institutional treatment is the  most expensiveitem in the cost of those health services which provide treatment, as opposed to the sanitary services whose primary object is prevention.It thus merits  special consideration.  Our observations fall under three main heads :       (a)  Capital cost.      (b)  Cost of maintenance.      (c) Proper use of the facilities provided.(a) Capital cost.  182.  We are of opinion that much of the institutional accommoda-tion already provided  is excessive in first cost.  We have not beenable to inquire  minutely into the causes of this  excess, but itappears probable that it is due largely to the natural desire of per-sons responsible  for the administration of health  services to securethe best possible equipment  for their service.  Instances brought toour notice  suggest that this  tendency is found both  in the require-,ments of Government Departments and in proposals submitted byLocal  Authorities.   In  any  event, the facts  are that the average cost of isolation hospitals in England  for which loans  have  been sanctioned in  the last five years is  770 per bed  excluding the costof the  site  (in one instance the cost is  1,072 per bed),  the average cost of sanatoria  and hospitals for tuberculosis sanctioned in the last ten years in England  is about   710 per bed,  excluding the cost ofthe site, and  the average cost of mental hospitals   475 per bed,excluding site, and furnishing.  We are  satisfied that these  highcosts are excessive and should be  substantially  reduced in futurebuilding.  183. We note  that certain hospitals have cost per bed an amountnearly equivalent to  that of three working class houses,  and  wethink that there should be an immediate inquiry by a competentcommittee  into building costs with a view to arriving at standards which will  provide without extravagance the essentials for the treat-ment of diaease and take  account of modern  methods of construc-tion.   When  these standards have been  determined action shouldbe taken by the Minister of Health  in consultation with Associa-tions of Local  Authorities, to secure that they are observed in futurebuilding of public  health  institutions.(b) Cost of Maintenance. 184. Comparative figures of the cost of maintenance of patients in institutions belonging to Local Authorities are circulated annually by  the Ministry of  Health  to the  Authorities  concerned.  Thegeneral question of comparative costs is  dealt with in  paragraphs  167G6                                                     D
193 and 194 below, but the principles there discussed are peculiarlyapplicable  to  costs of  maintenance in  institutions.  We do  notthink that  sufficient use is made of the information and experiencecontained in these returns : in many cases they are too  lightly dis.missed on the ground that the circumstances of different  Authoritiesand  different  institutions necessitate variations  in running  costs.We agree that statements of comparative costs do not in themselvesprovide proof  of efficient  management or of extravagance, but widevariations  in  the cost of running apparently similar  institutionsshould not be  allowed to pass without a definite effort by the Autho-rities concerned  to  ascertain the reasons for the  abnormal costs and to secure  that the maintenance expenditure of their  institutionsis not inflated by avoidable waste or faulty  management.  There isclearly greater difficulty in determining what should be  the properaverage cost  of maintenance  of each type and size of public healthresidential institution, but we suggest that  careful  consideration should  be given to the feasibility  of establishing  standards ofmaintenance costs on similar lines to the standards of building costsmentioned in  the previous paragraph.(c) Proper Use of Institutionsr   185. All Local Authorities are  aware that institutional treatment is expensive.   They  should therefore exercise  continual care tosecure that this form of treatment is reserved for. those cases  whichcannot  adequately be  treated  otherwise&apos;,  and that any particularpatient should not be maintained in an expensive type of institu-tion  for a condition  which can equally  well be treated  in  thepatienfs home or in a less elaborate type of institution.  Particularinstances  are mentioned in  sections  2 and 3  of this Chapter.Those Authorities who own  general hospitals should  bear in mind the importance of reducing the average occupation of their beds byearly diagnosis of cases admitted,  and by proper organisation oftheir out-patient department  to deal with cases which do not requireresidential treatment. (2)  STANDARDISATION OF HOSPITAL  SUPPLIES AND CENTRAL PUR-                              CHASING.   18G.  We consider that large economies  could be secured  in ex-penditure  on  hospital supplies by simplifying and standardising thearticles  required and  by systematic  purchasing.   If each  of  the institutions under the control of a Local  Authority decides  on the types of articles (e.g., of soap, disinfectants, towels, etc.) it requiresand caters separately for its own needs, there is obvious scope forwaste of effort and money.  The experience  of a sufficient numberof Authorities has shown that it  pays to give  closer  attention to the matter.
   187. The  Local  Authority  should receive statements  of  the requirements of each  institution, co-ordinate them, do away with unnecessary  variations  in  the types of articles or  goods  used; purchase them in suitable  quantities and make arrangements for their supply, either to a  central  store  for issue  to  the several institutions as required,  or for delivery direct to the  institutions, as may be most suitable to the local  circumstances.  188. The Local Authority, by  combining  the  experience of  the different institutions, will be in a position to determine  the  types of articles  to be  supplied  and thus  simplify  the  list of hospital supplies for the area as a whole.  In suitable cases the articles or goods may be supplied on the basis of a standard specification and central purchase will obviously make it easier to see that  the  goods supplied  conform to the specification.  It is advisable that a Local Authority should not fix on  a standard specification for its own area, hut should  in the first  place consult the British Standards Institute and  ascertain  whether  a standard specification  is  already  in existence.  1S9. Where no  steps  have  yet been taken in this direction, we suggest  that  simplification of supplies and central purchase might be introduced for all institutions under the control of one Authority. As experience is gained the system might be extended by co-opera- tion between neighbouring Authorities.  In particular, small Autho- rities whose areas  adjoin those  of larger Authorities where central purchasing  is  already  in  force  should  take advantage  of the economies to be secured by using the purchasing machinery set up by the larger Authority.  190. Action on the lines indicated above has already been success- fttlly taken both  by larger Authorities  and  by groups of  smaller Authorities.  We are strongly of  the opinion that the possibilities of the system should be  fully  explored, and we think that a saving of not less  than .- 300,000 could be  secured on the cost of supplies for Public  Health and  Poor  Law Institutions.  The principle  is capable of extension to  all  supplies required  by Local Authorities.      We  are informed that a small committee to consider thequestions of standardisation of  hospital supplies  and central pur- chase was recently set  up by the Public Health Congress and that a Report is in preparation.              (3) RECOVERY OF COST OF SERVICES.  191. There is much variation in the  practice of different Autho-rities in charging persons whose circumstances permit them to make some payment for the services provided  by the Authority.  We con-sider that,  as a general rule, all  persons taking advantage  of a   16766                                                    D 2
service provided by a  Local Authority should contribute, as far ustheir  means  permit, towards the cost of  the services provided torthem. To avoid overlapping and the risk that  the costs of collec-tion may exceed the amount of the charges collected, the machineryfor the collection of these charges should be organised so that oneofficer (or, in a  large area, one  group of officers) collects  for all services provided by the  Authority.   In particular types of  case itmay be more to the public interest to provide the service or even torequire that  use shall be made of the  service than to withhold it from  an  individual who  is able to,  but refuses to pay; but such exceptions should be clearly limited to cases in  which the function of the service is primarily  the protection of the public  health amionly incidentally the relief of the individual.  We suggest        (1)  that  the amount of the charge  to be recovered  should    be considered on  a uniform basis for each area  in relation to    the  financial  circumstances  of  each  family  or  individual    concerned ;       (2) that nary legislative anomalies  restricting the powers of    Local Authorities  to recover the cost of services provided should    be removed  as soon  as opportunity arises.             (4) WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS.   192. The general question of salaries and wages forms the  subjectof a separate part of the Report, but we think  it is appropriate inthis chapter  to mention the following points :         (a)  The wages  paid  to unskilled workmen employed in street    cleansing frequently exceed the rates paid  to skilled workmen    in trades in the same district, and in almost all cases consider-    ably  exceed the rates paid for unskilled labour in competitive    industries.       (b) Certain employees of institutions  are paid at rates from    which deductions  are made for board and lodging of an amount    less  than the actual  value of these emoluments.  The net cash    payment is thus indirectly and improperly increased.       (c)  The  hours  of work  in  mental hospitals vary from over    60 hours per week including meals,  to 48 hours per week ex-    cluding  meals.   We do not consider that  there is any  need     for the  reduction of the hours of duty to 48 per week  and we    are  informed that the  reduction necessitates three shifts  and    increases expenditure.         (5)  COSTING  RETURNS AND  COMPARATIVE COSTS.   193. Reference has already been made to this subject in para-graph 184 above.  We repeat that statements of comparative  costs are not  in themselves an  index  of  efficient or of extravagant ad-ministration, but that the3&apos; are of real value in  directing attentionto possible improvements in administration.
      We  suggest  that  the function of the  Ministry of health should not  be  limited  to  collecting  and  publishing  compara-live statements of costs in the hope that the statements will be putlo practical  use by the Local  Authorities concerned.  The whole system of statistical and cost returns should be overhauled       (a) To simplify them  as far as possible, and      (b) To make them more useful  for purposes  of comparison    and  for the guidance of the Ministry  in the control  of the    services for which they are  responsible.      The health services should be run as far as possible  on thelines of  a  business organisation and the Minister  might  find itprofitable to consult some  authority  on comparative statistics  andcosting in the world of business on any modification  of the present practice.  194. We have been impressed by the results  secured by the appli-cation to the cleansing services of  the  system described in para-graphs 145 and 146 of this Report.  An  intensive  attack on  similarprinciples on the anomalous costs of other health services obviouslypresents greater difficulties (for the reasons, inter alia, suggested inparagraph 151), but we feel strongly that the present time, whendevelopment of services is  financially  restricted,  offers a  specialopportunity  for the Ministry to assist  Local Authorities  in  con-consolidating and  improving  the  efficiency of  the  provision whichthey have already made, and we recommend strongly that  a  closeinvestigation should be made  of  the anomalies of  administrativeexpenditure  which  are suggested by  the returns in the Ministry&apos;spossession.  We can find no  basis on which to estimate the savings which would result, but we are satisfied that economy and a per-manent  general improvement  in  administration -would follow.  195. Some general comments on the cost of  printing are made inparagraph 272, but we wish to refer here  to the annual  reportsrequired  by  Regulation to be made  by Medical Officers of  health to their Councils and to  the Minister of Health  and the  annual reports statutorily  required  to  be made to  the  Local  Authorityby the Mental Hospitals Visiting Committee.  In a number of areasthese  reports are large and elaborate books, well  prepared  andarranged  and costing large sums for printing alone, without taking into account the time spent on their preparation.      We consider  that  such reports should  deal simply with thework  done by  the   Department concerned  in the  previous  yearand that  they should not be  used as an opportunity for recommend-ing policy. Much of the statistical material included,  e.g.,  in thereport of  the Medical Officer of Health,  has been included in otherreturns made to the Ministry of Health and we think that, unlessthe Medical Officer  of Health considers it necessary  that any  suchstatistics  should for special  reasons  be brought  to  the notice ofthe Council, this duplication should  be avoided.   We recommendthat the  Ministry should reduce the particulars called for  to theessential  minimum.16766
                       CHAPTER VI.                  PUBLIC  ASSISTANCE.                        1. Introductory.  196. The administration of poor relief is governed in the main bythe Poor Law Act, 1930, an Act which consolidated a large numberof Acts, ranging from  the  Poor Eelief Act,  1601, to the Poor Law-Act, 1927.  Responsibility for the administration of the poor law is now sharedbetween the Minister of Health as the Central Authority, and the council&apos;s of Counties and County Boroughs as the Local Authorities.  197. The local administration of the poor law was, by the LocalGovernment Act, 1929, transferred as from  the  1st  April, 1930,from  Boards  of  Guardians  (ad  hoc  Authorities)  to Councils of counties and  County Boroughs.   The property acquired  by Guar-guardians for  purposes  of  the  relief  of  the  poor  was also transferredto those Councils.  The Act provided that the transferred functions,except the  power of raising  a rate or  borrowing money, shouldbe exercised by the Councils       (a)  directly through a  Public Assistance Committee  which    may be a separate Committee, or another Committee of the    Council acting  as such  (in  either  case  with or  without  a    minority of co-opted members)  or      (b) by  some other Committee of  the Council  on  behalf of    and subject to  the general direction  and control of the Public    Assistance Committee.  198. All poor law matters  automatically  stand  referred to thePublic  Assistance  Committee, but Councils  have  discretion inaccordance with their  administrative schemes (formulated by themand  approved  by  the Minister)  as to how far  their final deter-determinations  of  these  matters  are  delegated to Committees.   TheAct also provides for the division of each County into areas underseparate Guardians  Committees  (consisting of County Councillors,District Councillors  and up to one-third co-opted members) to dealwith  applications  for relief.   The conditions&apos; in  London aregoverned by a separate part of the Act and are somewhat different from  those  described above.  199. One of the main objects of this transfer of functions was toensure that the administration of poor relief should, as far as pos-sible, be assimilated to or absorbed into  that of  the other servicesadministered by the Councils.  To this end the Act provides that intheir administrative  scheme a  Council may declare that certain poorlaw services for which parallel provision has been made under other
 Acts* shall be provided exclusively under those Acts instead of by way of poor relief.  A number of Councils have made such declara- tions in regard  to one or other of the special Acts, and others have made  provision  that some poor law services shall be performed, on behalf  of  the  Public Assistance Committee  and  subject  to  their general  direction and  control, by  some other  Committee of the Council not associated with the poor law.   Councils have also, under the authority of the Poor  Law Act, 1930, or equivalent statutory provision, appropriated poor law build- ings for other purposes, e.g., public hospitals, homes for mental defectives, or maternity homes.   Certain  forms of public assistance formerly administered by all Boards of  Guardians as poor law relief are, therefore, now admin- istered by some Councils as  poor relief under the Foor  Law Act, and by other Councils under the special Acts referred to above.  If a  Council  are not in a  position  to  grant, under their special Acts powers, assistance which they are legally required to afford, they must grant it under their poor law powers.   200.  Under the  Poor Law Act, 1930, Councils,  as Poor  Law Authorities, are bound to relieve destitution, no matter in what form it  may arise, as were  their predecessors under former poor  law statutes.  Destitution was defined by the Legal Adviser of the Local Government Board in his evidence before  the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws  and the Relief of Distress 1905-09  in  the following terms :        &apos;&apos; Destitution when used to describe the condition of a person    as  a subject for relief, implies that  he is  for the time being    without  material resources           (1) directly available and           (2) appropriate for satisfying his physical needs                (a)  whether actually existing or               (6)  likely to arise immediately.  By physical needs in this definition are meant such needs  as mustbe satisfied       (1) in order to maintain life or       (2) in order to obviate,  mitigate or remove causes endanger-    ing life  or likely to endanger life  or impair health  or bodily    fitness for self-support.&quot; * These Acts are :      (a) Tho Publir Health Act, 1875 ;     (b) The Local Government Act, 1SS8;     (c) Tho Mental Deficiency Act, 1913;     id) The Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918;     (e) Tho Blind Persons Act, 1920;     (/) The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act, 1921;     ig) The Education Act, 1921;as amended by any subsequent enactment, including tho Act of 1929.   16766                                                   D 4
  201. &quot;Within the limits of statutory regulations  issued by theMinister of Health, Councils and their Committees exercise a widediscretion in  the administration of relief, in determining whether aparticular person whose case is-under consideration is, or is  not,destitute, in  deciding whether relief should be given in an institu-tion or in the applicants home and in  deciding, if outdoor relief is given in a particular case, how much  relief should be given andthe conditions under which it should be given.  In determining  whether  any  applicant for relief is or  is notdestitute  and in  deciding upon the  amount of relief to be  given,Councils are  under obligation, except in certain cases in which thereis a special statutory  provision, to take into consideration all meansof  income available for  the   support  of  the  applicant  and  bisdependants.    The special  statutory exceptions  referred  to  tirecontained in  Section 48 of the Poor Law Act, 1930, which requiresPoor Law Authorities to  disregard the first 5s. of any sum receivedfrom a Friendly Society as sick pay and  the first  7s. 6d. of anyNational  Health Insurance  Benefit  received; and   in  the   WarPensions Act, 1918,  under which Poor Law  Authorities  are pre-cluded, in granting relief to a parent or other dependant (other thana wife or child) of a disabled man, from  taking into account anypart  of the disablement  pension awarded  to  a son who otherwise would have been held responsible for the whole or part of any reliefgranted to the parent or other dependant.  Guardians were  at onetime required to disregard a proportion of unemployment benefit,but this requirement was cancelled by  the Unemployment Insur-ance Act, 1922.   202. The  principles upon which relief should be  given were laiddown in  an  instructional  letter of the Local Government  Board ofthe 18th  March,  1910,  the following extracts from  which  werereproduced by the Minister of  Health in a Circular  of  the 3rdJanuary, 1930 :         &quot; Relief from public funds may only  be  given within the     limits prescribed by the law, and the law  as it at present stands     limits such  relief to  cases of destitution.  The Guardians are      entrusted with the  task of deciding upon the evidence before      them whether a particular person whose case is under con-      sideration is  or  is  not  destitute;  and  in  determining  this      question they have to remember that a person may be destitute      in  respect of the  want  of  some particular  necessity &quot;of life      without being  destitute  in  all respects;  as,  for  instance, a      person  who  is not  destitute in the  sense that he is entirely      devoid  of the means of subsistence  may yet be destitute  in      that he  is unable to provide for himself  the particular  form  of      medical attendance  or  treatment  of which  he  is  in  urgent
      &quot; Moreover, the relief given should be of such a nature that,    while it meets the need of the recipient, it is also in accordance    with the interests of the  community at large.  It is  obviously    not in accordance with the interests  of  the  community  that    the amount or description of the relief granted should be such    as either  to  discourage  the recipient from  striving  to  rega&quot;in    his independence, or to induce others who are  still independent    to relax their efforts to maintain their present position.&quot;    .  &quot; When outdoor relief is given it should be cai-efully adapted    to the needs of the case and adequate in amount.&quot;  203. Poor relief may be granted in two. main forms :       (i) Indoor relief in an institution maintained by the Council,    including relief to casuals, and      (ii) outdoor relief  in  the  applicants home.  The administration of poor law  institutions is now  governed bythe Public Assistance Order, 1930, a consolidation  of practically allpreceding Orders and Regulations.  The administration of outdoor relief, especially  as regards relief of the able-bodied, is governed by  the  Relief Regulation  Order,11)30,  as  amended by the Relief Regulation (Amendment)  Order,1032.  The requirements of the Orders relating to outdoor relief to able-bodied persons are briefly as follows :   A Council can, in the exercise of their discretion, grant uncon-ditional relief to  able-bodied women.  Relief may not be given toan able-bodied  man who is  employed and in receipt  of  wages orother  remuneration, but  unconditional relief may be granted to anable-bodied man requiring relief       (a) on account of  sickness or accident or of  bodily  or mental   infirmity (whether arising from old  age or otherwise) affecting    himself or any member of his family who is dependent on him    for support, or      (b) for the purpose of  defraying the expenses of  the burial   of any member of his family.To other  classes of able-bodied men relief may be granted if, so faras arrangements  made by the Council permit, he is  set to work,trained or instructed  in  accordance with those arrangements.   If,in special circumstances, a Council decide to grant outdoor relief toan able-bodied  man,  without setting  him to work, training orinstruction, they must report the case to the Minister of Health,and if      (a) the relief was  wholly  relief in  kind  given in a  particular    instance of emergency, or      (b) in any other  case the relief was not  given after  notice   from the Minister disapproving thereof,then the relief granted shall, if otherwise lawful, not be deemed tohe unlawful or be subject to be  disallowed.  Outdoor relief may begiven  in money or kind.
  204.  Tabular statements are appended  (Appendix III) showingthe amount  of  the  expenditure on poor relief and  the  number ofpersons relieved, namely :        Table 1.-Total expenditure on poor relief and the  number    of persons relieved, with the average cost of living  figure.       Table 2. Expenditure on, and number of persons in receipt    of,  institutional  relief, with separate  figures for  rate-aided    patients in  mental hospitals.       Table 3. Expenditure on, and the numbers in  receipt of,    out-relief, with separate  figures for  relief granted  to &quot; unem-    ployed  persons &quot;* and to other  persons, and the  numbers    relieved on  account of unemployment and for other causes.       Table 4. Expenditure on out-relief and numbers relieved for    each month from January, 1931, to July, 1932.  205. In considering these Tables it must be borne in mind thatthe figures are  affected by such factors as trade disputes,  particu-larly  those in the coal trade  in  1921 and 1926, the general tradesituation and changing industrial  conditions in recent  years, pay-ment of pensions and allowances under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and old Age Contributory  Pensions Acts,  and the numerous  changesin the benefits payable and the conditions under which those benefitshave  been  payable under  the  Unemployment  Insurance Acts.   Itis, however,  a matter of some concern that, whilst the introductionof these pensions and other benefits has led  to an  immediate drop in the numbers relieved of the class affected, these drops have alnioalways been  followed by increases to more than the original figureApart from such factors as are mentioned above the cost  of poorrelief tends  to  rise and fall with the cost of living.   Much alsodepends on  the Poor  Law Authorities themselves.  The greater the care exercised in administration, the less the cost of relief.  206.  It must  also be remembered that the appropriation since the1st April, 1930, of  a  number  of  establishments formerly adminitered under the Poor Law Act for public health and other purposesautomatically removes a  large majority  of  the inmates of thosestablishments from the list of persons in receipt of poor relief  andso reduces the number of  persons recorded as in receipt of institutional relief.  The accommodation available in the establishmentwhich have been appropriated between the 31st March, 1930,  andthe 1st January, 1932, was for about 37,000  persons.  * In this paragraph and in Appendix III the term &quot; unemployed personsmeans persons ordinarily engaged in some regular occupation, whether hreceipt of unemployment benefit or not, who uere in receipt of out-relief, andthe wives and dependent children of those persons.
  207.  As from the 12th November, 1931, Public Assistance Authori-ties were entrusted by the Government with new duties under theUnemployment Insurance (National Economy) (No. 2) Order, 1931,which required them to determine the needs of persons who, being over the age of 18 years,  were then in receipt of transitional benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and of persons over theage of  18 years who, after the 12th November, 1931, would cease to be entitled  to benefit by reason of the restriction of that benefitto a period of twenty-six weeks in a  benefit  year.   financial responsibility  for any  payments  of  transitional  benefit  up to theappropriate  rate remained with the Exchequer, and  the  LocalAuthorities were required to  inquire into the  circumstances of theapplicant and  determine  the  amount, if any, at which transitional payments should be assessed in  the same way  and  on the same basis as such  an application  would  be considered and determinedif it were made to them  by an able-bodied man  for poor relief.  208.  This work  which  was of great magnitude and  had to becarried on by  the  Public Assistance Authorities  side  by side withtheir ordinary  poor law duties, added very much to the difficultiesof those Authorities.  They had two parallel duties to perform, one in pursuance of their statutory obligations to relieve destitution fromthe local rates,  and the other as the agents of the Minister ofLabour to determine whether insured persons, who had exhaustedtheir right to unemployment benefit, were necessitous to the extentof requiring relief (which was to  be paid out of Exchequer money)and, if so, what was the extent  of  their need.  As  stated above,the needs of both classes  should be assessed by the same standards.Councils have  thus had to deal with a new class  of applicants who in the  past  have been accustomed  to receive assistance at rates which were  uniform  throughout  the Country without  any refer-ence to their  financial resources.  The  necessity for the  changeover to the new arrangements requiring the needs of these appli-cants to be ascertained and the  rate of  payment assessed accord-ingly, has been generally recognised, but has created new problems for  the  Public Assistance Authority and has inevitably  affectedordinary poor law administration.  209. We have  considered the question of public assistance underfour main heads :       Institutional Relief.      Provision for Casuals.      Out-relief.      Amendment of the Poor Law Act, 1930.  We regret that it is impossible  for us to arrive  at an estimate ofthe amounts which  might be saved by the adoption of any of  our recommendations.  Many of  them may  in  themselves  appear tobe unimportant,  but we  have no doubt that there are substantial economies to be  secured  in poor law administration  by all Local
Authorities if they are prepared to consider their present adminis-tration  in a properly  critical spirit and are ready  to resist the temptation to assume that all their present  arrangements are thebest and most  economical which can  be devised.   In particular the sum to be saved by the  limiting of the  granting of out-relief to the relief of  destitution alone would  be very  large indeed.                     2.  Institutional Relief.  210. The Ministry of Health have for some years  issued annualcosting  statements for  the several classes of  (poor law institutions.Before the transfer of poor law functions from Boards of Guardiansto the Councils  of Counties and County Boroughs, the statements were not on comparable lines with those issued  in respect of sana-toria and maternity homes belonging to  the Public Health Authori-ties.   Since the transfer, however, they have  been prepared ona basis  which permits  of  comparisons  being made between themaintenance costs of all classes of residential institutions possessed by Councils, whether as Poor Law Authorities or as Health Autho-rities.    The first set  of these  modified statements has recentlybeen issued and  relates  to the year ended 31st March, 1931.  In  Chapter I  we  have referred to the value of costing state-ments as  a means  for  securing  more economical  and  efficient administration,  and, &quot;in  view  of  the wide variations  shown  in the costs  of  apparently comparable poor law institutions,- we wish toemphasise here  that what we say  in  Chapter  1 with regard toimproved administration and the  study of statistical returns andcosting statements applies equally to poor law as to  other institu-tions.  211. Our attention has been  drawn to  the fact that some insti-tutions in  the centres  of towns are on sites which  have becomeextremely  valuable, and some Authorities may find it worth while to dispose  of such sites where they are in a  position to house thedisplaced inmates elsewhere with resulting economy.  212. Under Article 11  (3) of the Relief Regulation Order,  1930,the case  of every person  receiving institutional relief  is required tobe reconsidered within six weeks after admission  and thereafter notless  frequently  than  once in  27 weeks.   We believe  that inmany  Counties  and  County  Boroughs the  half-yearly  reviewrequired by the Order has either  not been carried out or has beendone  in  a  perfunctory way, and  we are of opinion that substantial economies could be  secured  by intensive enquiry into all  indoorcases in the manner contemplated by the  Order.    Matters towhich special attention should be  paid are :        (i) Ghildren&apos;s   Homes. Whether  children  have  parents    who are or have become capable of maintaining  them without    assistance from the rates  (many  admissions to children&apos;s homes    are  by transfer from poor law or other hospitals and children
     may  have been transferred  with a  view to providing them     with  special care during convalescence or because their parents     outside the  institution  were  not at the  time in a  position     adequately to  maintain them).    The  present circumstances     of the  parents should be  investigated  and  if they  are in a     position to do so they should  be  required  to  remove their     children from  the poor law homes.       (ii) General  Institutions. Enquiry should be made whether     there are relatives who  are able and willing to allow inmates     to reside with them.    Where  sons or  daughters  are con-     tributing  towards  the  inmate&apos;s maintenance,  they should,     wherever possible,  be  urged to take  their parents  out of     institutions.       (iii) Hospitals and  Infirmaries. Many  cases  are  admitted     as sudden or urgent by Medical Officers, Masters and Relieving     Officers.  Early and thorough enquiry  should be made as to     the means of  such  inmates,  the circumstances of their liable     relatives, and  the need  for continued institutional relief.  We     are informed that considerable numbers of persons who were     originally admitted  on grounds of sickness or old age to poor     law institutions directly on a  Relieving Officer&apos;s Order, would,     if their  circumstances were properly  investigated  by  the     appropriate Committee,  be found not to be  in need  of  relief.     We consider it undesirable that  Orders for admission to insti-     tutions for the sick and infirm should be  issued by Relieving     Officers and  Medical Officers  except as  a matter of urgency.     In  such  cases the Committee   should,  in  accordance with     &quot;Article  26 of the Public Assistance Order, 1930, make  proper     investigation before confirming the Order.      (iv) Mental  Inmates. Thorough  and regular investigation     should be made into the present circumstances of each inmate     and of all liable relatives.   In the case-of persons of unsound     mind, particular care should be taken to enquire whether they     possess  property or  have moneys due to them.  Cases can no     doubt be  found in which  the possession of some means has     already  been reported but  the matter has not  been properly-     followed up.  213. The cost of  relieving children  in institutions is much higherthan the  cost of boarding out,  and we recommend that all Autho-rities should, as far as is practicable, adopt the policy of  boardingout all children who are, under  the Regulations, eligible for board-ing out  (i.e.,  orphans,  deserted and adopted  children).    Whensuitable foster-parents can be found we are satisfied that  boardingout is not  only an economy, but also  a benefit to the children.  Ascountry homes are preferable, we suggest that closer liaison betweenCounty Councils and County Borough Councils is desirable for theextension of this work.
  214. Where Authorities are experiencing a demand  or additional accommodation  in  their mental hospitals, we  are  of opinion thatthe cost of extending the hospitals could in many cases be avoidedif harmless senile patients could be removed to vacant accomnioda-tion in poor  law institutions, not necessarily in institutions of thesame Authority. In view of the high  cost of erecting and main-taining  mental  hospitals,  we  think it would frequently be  an economy to extend other institutions for the reception of harmlesssenile cases rather  than to extend the mental hospital itself.  215. Since  the transfer of poor law institutions to the  Councils,a good deal has been done in the way of classification of the inmates,but  there are still  many  institutions in which classes of personswho do not require much skilled nursing and medical attention (forinstance, the  aged  and infirm)  are mixed with cases of acute sick-ness.  We  think  that  economies  might  be  secured  by  betterclassification.  216. The surplus accommodation  in poor law institutions is beingutilised to an increasing extent for  mental defectives and it is pro-posed to use a number of such institutions wholly  for lower grademental defectives.  We are in  agreement with this policy, but  weconsider  that the  standard of  the  requirements of  the  Board ofControl for  the  adaptation of  poor law buildings for this purpose should be reduced  as  a temporary  measure of economy, and thatCouncils should be allowed to  spread their programme of adapta-tions over a period of years.    We feel also  that the  process ofcongregating high grade mental defectives in specialised institutionsshould,  under present conditions,  be delayed.  At  present  thereare in many poor law  institutions a few high grade mentally defee-tive women who are usefully employed, for example, in laundriesand kitchens.  If these women are  withdrawn to specialised  insti-tutions, it is necessary to replace them with paid labour.  217. In our view the appropriation  of  poor law infirmaries as public health hospitals, though desirable in principle, is likely to lead to additional expense  and should not, under present financial conditions, be unduly  pressed.  218. We  are  concerned at the high cost of maintenance payable by  Public Assistance  Authorities  for  children sent to  voluntaryindustrial schools.  The reason for  this, we understand, is that  the managers of the schools have to conform  to Home Office require-ments before, and  so long as the schools are certified by the HomeSecretary.  The Home Office  requirements are of  a high standard and extend to the  number and qualification of all  staff, includingcraftsmen  and  teachers,  diet,  accommodation  and state of  thebuilding.   The  type of children received,  the particular training scheme at the  school, and sometimes religious education are alsofactors,  in the  cost.    The managers  each year  have to submitdetailed  estimates of  their  expenditure, and these have to be
Illapproved by  the  Home  Office before they prescribe the rate of payment to be charged for the year for children sent to the schools.  The number of children sent  to the schools has decreased yearby year  for some  years, and the Home Office decided to close sixschools,  with  a view to reducing  the amount of vacant accommoda-tion.  Five of the six have been closed,  but the numbers  haverecently  shown a tendency  to increase,  and for this reason it isdoubtful whether  the  sixth will  be closed.  We understand, however, that the  present certified accommoda-tion of the schools was in many of  them fixed  a long time ago,and that the  Home Office contemplate a revision  of the  certifiedaccommodation in accordance with modern standards.   This wouldresult in a considerable reduction in  the  aggregate  of the numbersof children received.   We  think &quot;that this is  not  the  time forattempting  to raise  the  standards   of  accommodation  in these schools.   It may well  be possible to use any surplus accommodationby setting  apart  some of them for  the accommodation  of poorlaw children  other than  children  liable to be  sent  to  certifiedindustrial schools.                   3. Provision for Casuals.  -219. The Departmental Committee on the Relief of the CasualPoor in 1930 found that the accommodation for casuals was in manypoor law institutions very inadequate and  very unsatisfactory andthat there was lack of uniformity in the period of detention andthe tasking  of  casuals.   They recommended,   inter  alia, that adequate accommodation of  a higher  standard should be provided,that detention for two nights  should  be enforced, save in the caseof a wayfarer  holding a &apos;&apos; vacant ticket &apos;&apos;  issued by an employment exchange, and that  a useful  task of work should be  required ofall casuals during their stay in the  casual wards.  With referenceto detention  the Committee said &quot; we see no case  for providinganything at the public expense, which helps,  or even appears tohelp, a working man  to  start on the tramp, and men already onthe road who  are most likely to benefit by help and sympathy would fail to receive such help unless  they stayed in casual  wards long enough to enable some sort of enquiry to be made  into their circum-stances.   It would be  difficult  to do this if they arrived one evening and left  early the following  morning and remedial measures would fail to come  into play unless our recommendation  that  all men should stay at least two nights in a casual ward is adopted.&quot;  they also stated &quot; early discharge increases  rather than reduces thenumber of wayfarers who apply for relief as casuals.&quot;  With  reference to  tasks  of work  the  Committee stated &quot; theevidence which has been given to us tends to show that a properlyarranged task of  work is not at all disliked by the better classcasual, but  would act as a check on  those vagrants who have themoney to provide themselves with a night&apos;s shelter.....We
attach great value  to the performance of a useful task.  It  would benefit ordinary wayfarers and serve as a test for the less desirableclass  of vagrant who could provide himself with board and lodgingout of his earnings, insurance  benefits  or pension  but prefers to devote them to other purposes.&quot;  220. The Minister of Health subsequently issued an Order, thePublic Assistance (Casual Poor) Order,  1931,  embodying most ofthe  Committee&apos;s recommendations,  including those  referred toabove, and steps have been taken to secure the  further accommoda-tion required for the proper housing of casuals.  Since  the issue ofthe Order a substantial general improvement in the accommodationhas  been  secured,  but  the all  round  progress  attained  beinginsufficient  to  justify  universal  enforcement of  Article  7 of theOrder (which  requires  two  nights&apos;  detention) the  Minister hasdecided that that  Article shall not be  universally  enforced untilthe 2nd January next.  221. We are of opinion that there should be no further suspension of the Ministers Regulations requiring the detention of casuals for two nights and the imposition of a task during the intervening day,subject to  the  provision aheady made in the Regulations to meetexceptional cases.  222. Since the issue of the Report of the Departmental  Cotn-mittee there has  been a very  substantial rise in the number ofcasuals lelieved in casual wards,  as shown in  Appendix  IV.  Weare unable definitely to ascribe this increase to any specific  cause,but one of the causes is undoubtedly  the continued general depres-sion  in industry,  and  we  understand  that a number of PublicAssistance  Authorities, especially  County  Councils,  are  of the-opinion that one of the reasons is  the operation  of the  PublicAssistance (Casual Poor) Order, 1931. Whatever may be the cause.we think that  the present numbers relieved should  be consideredabnormal and  that  Authorities should not  be  required to provide accommodation for the abnormal numbers  of casuals at present being relieved.  To meet this we consider that  the Minister  shouldnot press Authorities to provide accommodation for day use  solelybut should permit the day rooms to be used as dormitories in periods of pressure.  We recommend also that the Regulations should allow the issue of bread  to casuals according  to their  wants instead ofrequiring as at present  that the full prescribed ration should always be supplied.                          4. Out-relief.   223.  The present condition of out-relief has ca&quot;used  us consider-able  anxiety.  It will be seen from Table 3 of Appendix III thatthe estimated  expenditure for the current financial year shows anincrease of over two million pounds over  the sum  expended lastyear, and it is  probable that  the actual expenditure will exceed even this estimate.
                              113                                9  .* ^                                                  .  .         .    *J *J *J  There is no doubt that this increase of expenditure is in the maindue to the growth  in  the numbers of unemployed,  and to someextent  to alterations in the regulations governing the payment ofunemployment benefit.  Moreover many families have now expendedany savings they may have had.  Whatever the  cause,  the burden placed upon local financial resources has  become  extremely  heavy and  in  some  districts is    .  .straining local resources almost to breaking point.  This has already  been recognised by the Government who haveexpressed  their  intention  of  summoning  a conference of  LocalAuthorities at an early date to discuss the Exchequer Grant Formulain the  Local  Government Act, 1929.  With the growth of unem-ployment the problem  has become national rather than local, andin our view,  therefore, the relief of the able bodied unemployedshould be a national charge.  This would naturally entail ajreduc-tion in the block grants piaid to Local Authorities, and a re-distribu-tion of such other contribution as might still have to be made bythe Authorities themselves.  224.  There is, however, another aspect  of the matter which weview with grave concern.  The factors to  which we have referredabove do not, in our view, provide a complete explanation  of theheavy increase of expenditure on out-relief which  has taken place inrecent  months.  From the  information before us, we are  satisfiedthat in many areas failure to comply  with the condition that onlydestitution should be relieved is an important contributory  cause.We find in several of these that scales of relief have not been reducedwith the drop in the  cost of living, and  that there is a  growingtendency to make incomes up to some standard  scale fixed for thearea.   Payments are made  automatically,  or almost  so, to definedclasses of persons including persons in receipt of pension, benefit orother allowance.  There is an increasing failure to regard householdincome as an important factor.  Over and  above  all  the  question ofthe amounts of out-relief to be  granted is becoming a matter oflocal  and party  politics.   There are signs that the  methods ofadministration   which  brought  some Boards  of   Guardians tobankruptcy may be introduced  among the new  Poor Law Autho-rities.  This, in our opinion, would be disastrous to Local GoveTn-ment,  and nothing but drastic action is likely to prevent  it.  Thereduction in the numbers relieved and in the cost of relief effected by the West Ham appointed Guardians during their period of office is, in  our view, convincing evidence of the mischief which results from  poor law administration  being allowed to  become a politicalquestion.  When the appointed Guardians  took office in  July, 1926,there were 60,399 persons in receipt of out-relief at a weekly cost of 18,043.   When  they ceased  to function  in  August, 1929,  thenumber relieved was 14,941 and the weekly cost   4,011.  Through-out their period of office the appointed Guardians were subject tothe closest scrutiny and criticism  by persons and organisations who
were opposed to their appointment;  but the number of cases of realhardship discovered  was infinitesimal, and it has been proved thatthe economies secured were the result of impartial but by no meansharsh administration.  225. We  feel, therefore, bound  to recommend that legislationmore  or less on the lines of  the Boards of Guardians  (Default)Act, 1926, should be passed so  that the Minister of Health could begiven similar powers with reference to  the  administration of poorrelief by Local Authorities to those which have recently been con-ferred upon  the Minister of Labour with reference to the administra-tion of  transitional  payments,  i.e. those conferred by Article 7 ofthe Order in Council of the  7th  October, 1931, under which if, inthe opinion of the Minister of Labour, any  Councils do not, or donot efficiently, carry out the  duties conferred upon  them  by theOrder, those duties  may be exercised by persons appointed by theMinister.  226. While we believe that  it  is in any case essential that effect should be given to  the above  recommendation, we are of opinionthat it is at best a  palliative.  The introduction  of the  means testin connection with  transitional  payments has considerably  addedto the importance of the  administrative and  political problems towhich we have  already referred, and has led in many jiarts of theCountry to so serious a state of affairs that we feel bound to express the opinion that the responsibility of granting relief to  able-bodiedpersons should be removed altogether from  the  purview of LocalAuthorities.  227. This problem has  doubtless been very carefully consideredby  the Boyal  Commission on  Unemployment, and we do not wishto forestall  any  recommendation  that Commission may make.  Werecognize, too, that  there would  be  great difficulties in devising the requisite  administrative machinery, but we would urge  upon theGovernment the necessity for a full examination of the situationwhich has  been  created, and  of  the  question whether  in  theinterests of good government,  the distribution of relief to the able-bodied unemployed  and the  operation of the means test in connec-tion with transitional payments, should not  be placed in the handsof independent  persons.  In this way it might be possible to effectwhat we regard as of vital importance, the almost complete removalof the whole problem from the sphere both  of local and of nationalpolitics, while in our view  the  change would be likely to lead to substantial  reduction of expenditure.   228.  While we are of opinion that the arrangements  suggestedin the foregoing paragraphs offer the only real solution of the difncul-ties to  which we  have referred,  we have closely examined  the
present methods of administration and submit the following recom-tnendations  as  means  of  making  that  administration  more.efficient :       (i) It should be a rule that there should never be less than    three  members present at  meetings of local relief committees    held for the purpose of considering applications for relief, and,    further,  that  except  in county  areas, other  than  London,    members of relief committees should not deal with applications    from persons resident in  areas in which the members reside,- or    are seeking election, or for which they have been elected.  Our    reason for excepting county areas is that such a rule  will    frequently be found  impracticable in rural counties.      (ii)  In our view the&apos; appointment of revisory  or appeal com-    mittees is desirable for the purpose of seeming :           (a)  the  special consideration of difficult cases or classes        of cases, and          (b)  a reasonable degree of uniformity throughout each        public assistance area.      We also recommend that  County Councils or their Public    Assistance  Committees  should  be  given  statutory  power to    rescind or vary awards of  relief  made by  Guardians Com-    mittees.  We  make  this recommendation because we consider    it to be a vital  principle that a County Council should have    control  over  the  expenditure  of its  committees  and  sub-    committees.  Under Section  5 (3) of the Poor Law Act, 1930,    the determination of  the  nature and amounts  of  the  relief    to be  given to any applicant is a function of Guardians Com-    mittees  &quot; Subject to such general or special restrictions  and    conditions  as  the County Council  may  from time  to time    impose.&quot;   In  order  to obtain control over the  amount of out-    door relief ordered  by Guardians  Committees a few County    Councils,  through their Public Assistance Committees, have    prescribed scales of relief.  In many areas, however, it is not,    in our opinion, appropriate  to adopt uniform scales of relief.    One Guardians Committee may be unduly extravagant and we    think it ought to be competent for the Council to exercise control    over such  a Committee without  the necessity  of  prescribing    scales of relief or regulations.      (iii) We  wish  to  emphasise  the  economies  which   are    obtained by the provision of an adequate  staff to secure  full    inquiry  into the  circumstances of every applicant  for relief,    and the waste and demoralisation which arise from inadequate    investigation.    Proper  investigation ought  to include home    visiting and the  verification  of wages  of all members of  an    applicants household.   We  consider also  that  full records on    case papers are essential, that cross visitors should be attached
 to the Council&apos;8 head office  and not to local offices, and that where pay  clerks  are not employed receipts for relief should be furnished  by the recipients.   (iv) We attach  great importance to the principle mentioned in paragraph  202 above that  &quot; it is obviously not in accordance with the interests of the community that the amount or descrip. tion of the relief granted should be such as  either to discourage a recipient from striving  to  regain  his independence or to in- duce others who are  still independent to relax their  efforts to maintain their present position.&quot;   It  is  clearly,  therefore, undesirable&apos; that a person should be in approximately as good a position when receiving relief as he would be when  employed.   (v)  We think it will not  infrequently be found that where Councils have  separate  out-relief scales for sick and  infirm applicants,  these scales are unnecessarily high  compared with the  scales for  able-bodied applicants.   It  is wrong to make the general standard of relief high because  particular cases are in exceptional need.   Persons in need of  additional relief by reason of the  nature of their  infirmity can always be helped on the  strength  of certificates by District Medical Officers. We recommend a general revision  of  all scales  with  particular regard to the continued fall in the cost of living, accompanied by a close review  of individual  cases with  a view to ensuring that the relief  granted is not more than is needed  to relieve destitution.  (vi) In our view the grant of relief at rates exceeding the appropriate current scale  of  unemployment benefit should not be made without the sanction of a revisory committee.  (vii) We recommend that sub-section 2 of Section  48 of the Poor Law  Act, 1930, which provides  that, in granting out- door relief,  a  Council shall not take into consideration the first 7s.  6d. of  any health insurance benefit received, should be repealed.    It  is  not reasonable that destitution caused by physical infirmity should be doubly relieved out of public funds, first out of insurance benefit and then out of the rates. We also recommend that sub-section  1 of the Section  which similarly excludes the  first  5s. of  Friendly  Society  benefit should be repealed.  Here again it is impossible  to justify a charge on the rates for relieving a need which  is otherwise met.  (viii) We think that Councils could, with advantage, exer- cise  closer  control  over  relief granted on  the  certificates  of district Medical Officers, and for this purpose we suggest that other Medical Officers employed by Councils might be assignedthe duty of acting as referees in cases of doubt, more  or lesson the lines of the medical referee system for National  HealthInsurance benefits.
                          117                                  n f F*   (ix) With the advent of health and unemployment benefits,   u   tJmaternity benefit, widows&apos;, orphans&apos; and old age pensions, dis-ability pensions, workmen&apos;s compensation and other State bene-fits, the degree  to  which individuals remain  responsible forthe maintenance of other members of  their family has  been greatly diminished.   We attach vital importance to maintain-ing the principle of family responsibility, in so far as it remains,and we think that relief should never be  granted  without fullinquiry as  to the extent to which other members  of an appli-cant&apos;s household are in a position  to help.  It would  appearthat in many areas  the  amounts which  the  children of a  reci- &apos;pient of relief  are expected to contribute to  the  family  poolare unnecessarily low, and that in some cases the earnings ofchildren  over 16  are ignored when considering family income.We would  stress the importance of  the  view expressed  by theMinister of Health  in a  recent Circular that &quot; in -assessing the amount of relief to be  afforded, the general  principle isthat income and  means from  every source available  to the household must be taken into account, subject to ...  . statu-tory exceptions.&quot;  The  resources of the household should be reckoned as those of a  single unit.   By this  means not  onlyis  the cost of  relief lessened  owing to the  reduced  rate of allowance and  the reduction in  the  number  of persons eligiblefor relief, but  the principle of family responsibility is rnain-tained.   (x)  In some areas it is the general practice to assume profitat  rates varying from 3s. to 7s.  6d. a week for each lodger whois  also provided with board.   In one county the payment  by alodger in excess  of  20s. is deemed  to be profit, in another a percentage proportion of the amount paid is  taken as profit,subject to a minimum of 5s.  a week.  It is desirable that  eachPublic Assistance Authority should take steps, to avoid  suchdiscrepancies.  Similarly, regulations  may be desirable regard-ing the assessment  of profit from  sub-letting. &apos; Recipients of out-relief who reside in houses too large for  their own require-ments should be encouraged to sub-let  surplus rooms.   (xi) There appears to be much confusion of thought in some areas as  to the manner in which disabilit3r pensions should betaken  into account.  The disability in respect of which the pension has been awarded may or may not be such as to call for a greater measure of  assistance than would normally be appropriate and  we think that Relieving Officers should  be instructed to state in their report on  an application for relief,the grounds on which the  pension was granted and the natureof  the disability.  The  committee  should then determine  onthe facts of the particular case to what extent the man&apos;s dis-ability increases his need, if at all.  It could,  with  advan-tage,  be pointed out  again to Public  Assistance Authorities
 that it is wrong in principle to  adopt a uniform rate or per- centage of the amount of disability pensions to be ignored.   (xii)  We  have already mentioned as one of the most potent causes  of  the increase of pauperism  the  tendency  to  grant relief automatically to bring the applicants income up to an agreed  minimum.   We are satisfied that there is a very large amount of  waste  due to  this practice.  This is  particularly noticeable where there is a  regular  and general practice  of supplementing  unemployment insurance benefit,  transitional payments, old age and widows pensions, and similar  income, if the  applicants have  nee other resources  available.  It is a violation of  the  cardinal principle  of  poor  law administration to grant relief as a matter of rule or right,  and in our opinion a Council proceeding on these  lines is failing in its duty. We have heard  also of a practice of at least&quot; one Council of grant- ing winter  fuel  allowances to  every person in receipt of tin- employment benefit, without investigation of the applicant&apos;; need for such additional allowance.   We cannot too  stronglv condemn such a practice.   (xiii) In our view there is no justification  for the  practice of ignoring  the fact that the children of an  applicant for relief are provided  with meals  by the Local Education  Authority. Such provision clearly relieves the applicant  of certain responsi- bilities  and  should be taken into account.   (xiv)  In  our opinion the requirement  of work where prac- ticable  as  a condition  to the  grant of out-door relief to an able-bodied  man is  an  economy as well as  a  statutory obliga- tion.   We are at a loss to understand why  so many Public Assistance Authorities have up to the  present found it so ditii-cult  to  formulate arrangements for setting  able-bodied recipi- ents of  relief to work.  (xv)  Another  reason for the  serious  increase in  out-doorrelief in recent years appears to be the prevailing practice of granting relief in this form  to any  able-bodied person whethermarried or  single.  Until the  commencement of the  presentperiod of industrial depression, it  was the practice in many parts of the country for Boards of Guardians to  refuse out-door relief to single men  or to men recently  married and tooffer them orders for admission  to institutions.  We recom-mend that more  consideration should be given to the  questionwhether after a specified period,  during which relief has beengiven to an able-bodied man, such relief ought to be continued,or whether  as an alternative the  man should be offered anorder for admission to an institution.   There is a grave dangerof a permanent pauper  class growing  up, marrying and rear-ing families  at the expense of the  ratepayers, and whilst thedifficulties  in finding  employment  at  the present time  must always  be  remembered  it  certainly seems  that this  problem should be carefully examined from  all  aspects.
9 Kr*o 0 D           4. Amendment of Poor  Law  Act,  1930.  229.  We consider that economies would result from the following amendments to the Poor Law Act, 1930 :        (i) Sub-section 1 of  Section 14 should be amended to secure    that  a maintenance order can be  obtained against  both the    husband  and the son of a chargeable person,  and that orders    should be obtainable in respect of relief granted to persons able    to  work.       (ii) The  mother of  an illegitimate child should be bound to    maintain that child after her marriage (Sec.  14  (2) ).       (iii)  Section 19 should be amended so as to  provide  that an    undertaking given  by  liable relatives to  a  Council should be    enforceable in the same way as a maintenance  order.       (iv)  Section 19 (2) should be amended (a) to enable a wages    certificate given  by an employer to be accepted as prima facie    evidence  and (6) to impose a legal obligation on employers to    make wage returns in respect of persons liable  to maintain.       (v) Section  20  should be  so  amended  as  to  override the    decision in  Pontypridd  Guardians  v.  Drew  and  so  enable    Councils  to recover the cost of six years&apos; relief if a recipient is    subsequently in a financial position to repay.       (vi)  Section 165  (4)  should be  so amended as to extend the    principle set out in the  preceding sub-paragraph  to  men who    desert their families.       (vii) Section 49 should confer  upon officers  power to  grant    relief on  loan, subject  to confirmation by  the Council.       (viii) Sub-section 1 of Section 51 should  be made obligatory    and should apply to old age pensions  and insurance benefits.       (ix)  The provisions of Sections 84 to 109  dealing with settle-    ment and removability are in our  view unnecessarily  compli-    cated and should he simplified.  230.  We are  aware that the County Councils Association andthe Association  of Municipal Corporations are  jointly consideringthe scope of the Poor Law Acts and Orders and propose  to submit to the Minister of Health proposals for such amendments  thereto asthey consider desirable.  In view of  the  duty  entrusted to us weconsider, however, that the recommendations  detailed above shouldbe dealt  with now and should not await  the consideration by theGovernment  of the recommendations as a  whole  of the twoAssociations.  231.  We consider also that the practice of reckoning as incomethe value of  maintenance  in  a poor  law  institution of a non-con-tributory old age pensioner and thus disqualifying him from  pension should  be abandoned, and that old age pensions payable to  inmatesof  institutions  should  be  diverted  to  the  Public  assistance authorities unless the pensioner has dependants.
                       CHAPTER  VII.    GENERAL  ORGANISATION  AND  FINANCIAL                    ADMINISTRATION.                    1. Salaries and  Wages.  232. The total  gross expenditure  of  Local Authorities on ralefund services in the year 1929-30 was  311,761,000.  After allow-ing for income from fees, rents, repayments, etc., the expenditurefalling on  rates and  grants  was  262,352,000.  Their  employees,administrative, professional,  technical, clerical and manual numberhundreds of thousands.   Where the  measure of expenditure andemployment is so great, there is clear  need for close and continuousscrutiny  of the administrative arrangements and organisation.  Much  has been done  by Local Authorities within the last few-years to modernise  their administrative &quot;procedure and to  obtainincreased efficiency, but much still remains to be  done.               (1) COST OF  SALARIES AND WAGES.  233. The largest  item  in the  revenue  expenditure of   LocalAuthorities is-the cost of salaries and wages.  We found that therewere no  general  statistics available giving details  of  the cost andwe  therefore obtained particulars ourselves from a sample numberof Authorities of different types and size.  We  scrutinized  closely the information thus  obtained  and checked it  as  far  as possible with official and unofficial records; and as a result of our calcula-tions we  estimate that the total  cost of the salaries and wages of all officers and servants of all Local Authorities (including Teachers.Police  and Manual Workers, but excluding employees  engaged  inthe Trading Undertakings) was in the year 1930-31 approximately 122,000,000 or 40 pier cent, of the gross revenue  expenditure onrate fund services.  It will be appreciated that  this is an estimate  only  and nota precisely ascertained figure.  We see no reason  to doubt, however.that within the allowable limits of adjustment,  our estimate sub-stantially represents the true position.  *In  the  year in  question  Teachers&apos; salaries  cost approximately 50,000,000 and the salaries and pay of  Police rather  more than 14,000,000.  This leaves a balance of  some  58,000,000  as  the cost  of the salaries and wages of other Local Government Officers and Servants.  * Note: In addition  10,000,000 was paid in Teachers and Police Pensions,which are on a contributory basis.  The amount paid in Pensions (also cou-tributory) to tho rest of the Local Government Service is not available.
                              121                                 t/ *Jr * * This paragraph was agreed before tho Government announced its decisionto put into operation the second five per cent, cut in Police pay.  234.  The  May Committee recommended  that Teachers&apos;  salariesshould  he reduced by 20 per cent, and that the pensionable  salaries of all Police Constables and Sergeants should be reduced by  12^.- percent, in two equal instalments, one as soon  as possible  and theother a year later.  The  Government did not adopt these recommendations in their entirety.    A cut of 10 per cent, was made in Teachers&apos;  salaries,and an immediate cut of approximately 5 per cent,  in Police pay;measures for effecting  on Police expenditure additional  savings  of similar  amount in the  second year being  reserved for  furtherconsideration.  235.  We  recognise that  the  question  of the salaries  of bothTeachers and Police has been carefully examined by the  Govern-ment in the light of the May Committee&apos;s recommendation, but wehave felt that in view of our wide terms of reference we could not properly omit such major items of local expenditure from our review.  We have  therefore considered  them  further, and whilst we donot  propose  an  alteration  of  the  maxima  and minima  of the teachers&apos;  salary scales resulting from the Governmenfs decision,we  suggest  that in the first ten years of  service  the incrementsof Teachers in  both  the elementary and higher education  services should  be biennial instead of annual.  Under the existing arrange-ments a teacher does not get an increment until after two years&apos;service, and the effect of our proposal, therefore, is that incrementswould be granted in the 3rd, 5th, 7th and  9th years.  We do not propose that this change should apply retrospectively.According to the best estimate we can  make this recommendationwould result in a saving of about  235,000 in the first year,  465,000in the second year and  670,000 in the third year.  The full saving would not be realised for about 27 years, by which time it would amount to about  2,250,000 per annum.  *Witb regard to the Police we assume that it is the intention  ofthe  Government to make a further reduction of 5 per cent.  BothTeachers and Police are paid in accordance with national  scales.We  think it only right to say that  the foregoing recommendationwith regard to Teachers&apos; increments is submitted on the basis thatthe  above assumption is correct.(b)  Other  Local Government Officers and Servants.  236.  The remuneration of the other officers and servants of LocalAuthorities is not regulated  on  any national basis, but  generallyspeaking  is  determined by  the  individual Authority who  employthem.  The rate of remuneration varies  within  the widest limitsfrom the manual worker on a low weekly wage to the very highly paid officer, and within these limits  there are further variations  inthe  level of remuneration as between one authority and another.
  237. Since the  war successive  Governments have  year  by yearmaterially  added  to the  duties  of  Local  Authorities who  haveincreased their staffs to cope with the additional work.  We recog-nise that additions to staff and increases in salaries and wages wereinevitable,  but  after full  consideration we are of  opinion that  asubstantial reduction can  and should be made in the total cost ofthe administrative charges of Local Authorities.  Every Local Authority should review the whole of its work andof its  staff and consider  whether it  is justified in maintaining itspresent number of employees and whether the services performedjustify the  salaries and wages paid.  Much  of the special work  undertaken by  Local  Authorities inrecent years  has been completed,  while much  has been  curtailed orabandoned, and we  are satisfied that many instances will be foundwhere the  staff is in excess  of present requirements and should bereduced.  In certain cases  this could be  done by  allowing  poststo lapse  on vacancies occurring.  In many instances salaries, more  particularly of  the  highly paidofficers,  should, we  think, be reviewed in  the light  of present dayconditions, and, in  view  of  the character of some of the  scales of salary&apos; that are in force, there might be a considerably lengtheningof the incremental period.  The wages of the manual  workers should likewise  be  reviewer! inthe light of present  conditions and the wages paid by the best classof employers whose workmen are engaged on  comparable work.  A number of Local Authorities have  already made  deductionsfrom the salaries of their employees  in pursuance of the suggestioncontained  in  the  Minister  of Health&apos;s  circular   letter  of  11thSeptember, 1931.   We have  no  complete information  as  to what has  been done  and it  appears that there  has been a substantialvariation in practice. We consider that so far as the wide differences in bases  of payment admit, all Authorities should endeavour to make these reductions on a comparable basis, allowance  being made for-areas in which the  normal  increases to meet  post war costs  havenot been paid or where normal increments have been withheld.  Including  savings so made we  consider that in total the salaries and wages bill of  Local Authorities (excluding Teachers&apos; and Policepay) could be reduced by approximately five  million pounds belowthe figures for the year 1930-31.             (2) COMPENSATION. ADDITION OF YEAKS.  238. Most Acts of Parliament which cause displacement of LocalGovernment officers or otherwise involve &apos;them in direct pecuniaryloss contain  provisions for their  compensation  similar  to  those ofthe  Local Government Act,  1888.   The standard  form  of these provisions  is now that contained in the Eighth  Schedule to the LocalGovernment Act, 1929.  Paragraph  1 provides that the compensa-tion shall not exceed the amount which, under the Acts and Bides
relating to Her Majesty&apos;s Civil Service which were in operation inAugust, 1S88, would have been payable to a  person on abolition of office.  At that date the  relevant statutory provision was section 7of the  Superannuation Act, 1859, under  which compensation was determined by  a  calculation based upon  the number of years ofservice rendered, plus a number of years, varying in accordance witha scale with the number of years of service, up to a maximum addi-tion of 10 years.  That section was amended by the Superannuation Act, 1909, andthe practice of adding yeai-s is no longer applied in the Civil Service,the amount payable in case of abolition of an office  in the Servicebeing calculated only on the actual years of service rendered.  It  may  be  noted  that  under the Local Government and other officers Superannuation Act, 1922, an officer  who loses office, apartfrom any statutory intervention, by reason of a reduction of staff,or the abolition of his office or on similar  grounds does not get  thebenefit of  anj&apos; similar addition, and if he has not become entitledto a  superannuation allowance  receives only the amount of  thecontributions  paid by him with the accrued interest.  We considerthat the existing law requires amendment  so as to permit of discre-tion being used in deciding whether and if so  what number of years should be  added in  determining compensation.       (1) REVIEW BY PARLIAMENT OF LOCAL EXPENDITURE.  239.  Table 1 in paragraph 7 shows that in the year 1929-30 theexpenditure  of  Local Authorities falling on rates and grants was 262,352,203.   Of   this  sum  154,888,952  fell  on  rates  and1107,463,251 on grants.  At the end of the year the net outstanding loan debt  of LocalAuthorities was  1,157,879,087 divided as follows   The burden of rate borne expenditure falls on the community asa whole in much the same way as national expenditure and it shouldbe brought to  the  notice of Parliament at the time that national expenditure is  being reviewed. The Chancellor of the exchequer has already been asked if he could make  arrangements to present to the House of Commons a summary of the estimated expenditureof all Local Authorities for the coming year at the same time as heintroduces the Budget.  We are aware that each year an estimate of the amount  of ratescollected in the immediately preceding year is published in  connec-tion with the Budget, but it would be more satisfactory if figurescould be given  for the same year as that to which the Budget statement relates.2. Financial Administration.Trading Services.   422,897,029Housing and advancesfor House Purchase.     438,379,001Other Rate Fund    Services.   296,603,057
  It would be necessary in presenting  the  total figure  to  makeadjustments  for duplicated expenditure,  e.g.,  sums  paid by  one authority for institutional  treatment provided  by another wouldhave to be excluded, if the cost of the institutional treatment were included in the estimates of the receiving Authority  and  similarlywith regard  to Joint Boards.  It would also be necessary for theLocal Authorities  to  make  closer  estimates.   This is desirable initself.  In view of the great increase in the total debt of Local Authori-ties, and  the consequent effect on annual expenditure through thegrowth  in interest and sinking  fund charges, we   consider thatestimates of  capital expenditure also should be presented to Parlia-ment.      (2)  CONSIDERATION OF FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.  240. It is  necessary  to take a long view of capital expenditure,and, in considering capital  estimates for a-year, Local Authoritiesshould not confine their attention to that year only but should haveregard to the expenditure that is likely to be incurred during thenext three or five years.  In  this way they are  in  a position Joappreciate the cumulative  effect of &quot;the  various  capital comrnit-ments into which they may be proposing to enter.  We assume that sanctions given by  the Ministry  of Health orother sanctioning Authorities to loans for capital  expenditure  willbe limited to essential  services.  (3) PAYMENT OF SMALL ITEMS  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE  OUT OF                            REVENUE&quot;.  241. The  cost  of  works  which  involve large immediate capitaloutlay must usually  be met  by  borrowing,  but the  practice ofdefraying small items of capital expenditure  out of revenue shouldbe extended  and encouraged.  We recognize that  the  definition of what is a &quot; small item &quot;&apos;must have regard  to  the  size  and rateable value  of the  LocalAuthority and that  the  small  Authority&apos; with limited  resourcescannot usually avoid recourse to  borrowing for capital works of anysize.  Many of the larger Authorities regularly finance a proportion oftheir capital expenditure out of revenue, and a number have obtainedpower by Private Acts to  establish funds which are built up by contributions from  the rates and applied as  and when required to capital purposes.  It would be impracticable to lay down any  hard  and fast  rulebut we think that  generally  speaking the practice should be  thatsmall items  of capital expenditure which it may be necessary to incur in the course of  a year should, to the  extent of  the product of not less than a 2d. rate,  be defrayed from  revenue.
  We  have mentioned in Chapter 1 that under the percentagegrant system  the  tendency is to finance capital expenditure outof loans  rather than out of  revenue.   We understand that  someAuthorities have made arrangements with the Government Depart-ments  concerned whereby the Authorities themselves meet certainexpenditure out of revenue, but the Departments make their con-tributions annually spread over the appropriate  number  of years.We think  that where Authorities are in a position  to adopt this practice it  might with advantage be followed.   &apos;                       (4) LOAN PERIODS.  242.  The length of loan periods was fully examined by a SelectCommittee of  the House of Commons  in 1902 and we think it well to quote the following extracts from  their  Report although theReport is thirty years old the  views expressed hold good to-day :        &quot;  It appears to the Committee that  it is  the  duty of  a de-    partment  in deciding the  question of the period for repayment    as apart from the question of whether any  loan  should be    permitted, to  consider more  closely the durability  than the    desirability of  the works  or  purposes  for which the  loan  is    required,  and  to use very considerable caution in fixing such    period.  In deciding upon the probable duration of the useful    life of  any work the officers of a department have to  deal with    many  points  which  are&apos;purely matters of prophecy; they are    nob  empowered to superintend the  carrying out of  the  plans    placed before them, and have no adequate means of  ascertain-    ing or controlling the amount of attention given to the main-    tenance of the works when completed.   The shifting of popu-    lation, the alteration of accepted standards of efficiency, the    variation of boundaries, the progress of science and discovery,    exceptionally violent storms and a variety of other causes may    upset calculations based upon even the widest experience.       &quot;  Any tendency towards excess of caution which may exist    in the  departments is continually counteracted by the fact that    they are exposed to pressure from representatives  of  present    ratepayers whose  interests in this matter are from a financial    point of view entirely different from the interests of the rate-    payers in  future years.       &quot;  A further consideration  which  appears  to  justify resist-    ance to that pressure is that future ratepayers will have duties    of their own to deal with, for which they in their turn have    to borrow money, and to the extent to which the financial en-    gagements now entered into at their expense  prove  to exceed    the  advantages  received by them in respect of  those  engage-    ments will be hampered in the discharge of their duties.       &quot;  The Committee are of opinion that the caution exercised    by the Government  departments  under  present  conditions    attaching  to repayment is seldom  excessive.
      &quot; The Committee, in view of the increase of local debt, con-    sider that the only sound financial  system is that which makes    each generation  pay to a  considerable extent its own way.    Very  long periods of repayment have a distinct  tendency  io    lessen  the care  taken  by those who raise  money  by loans  to    make the amount of the loans as small as possible.&quot;  We draw special attention to the last sentence of this  quotation.  We understand that the  Ministry of Health periodically  revise the length  of loan periods and we think it  most desirable that thisshould be  done,  with particular reference  to the allowance to  bemade for  obsolescence,  which  we  regard as  a factor  of  special importance.   Changes  occur more rapidly  than  formerly andobsolescence may arise from a number of causes, e.g., the inventionof new and more efficient plant, alterations in standards, the intro-duction of  new methods such as the substitution of omnibuses fortrams, or the amalgamation of services.  If for any reason the life of the original  work expires  before theend of the loan period the burden  on the  Local Authority may  be heavy.  Where there is any portion of  a loan outstanding on works to be superseded, the Local  Authority are required to repay thatportion forthwith or it is deducted from  the  amount of any new loanwhich may be sanctioned.  We think that the tendency should be in the direction of shorterloan periods.  We recognise that Local Authorities in  Private Billsfrequently  seek,  and obtain,  from Parliament  longer  periods than are given in Departmental sanctions.  We venture to suggest  that the length of loans periods mightagain be reviewed by Parliament.                     (5)  FINANCE COMMITTEES.  243. We think that all Authorities should be required  by Statuteto appoint Finance  Committees with powers and duties similar tothose of the Finance Committees of County Councils.   Some Authorities,  we believe, do in  fact arrange  for such powersto be exercised by their Finance  Committee, but the  measure andthe  efficiency  of control  varies,  and  we think it  would be ofadvantage if a statutory  obligation was imposed.                            (6) Audit.   244. It is generally agreed that the  audit of  accounts by electiveauditors, as prescribed by  Section  25 of the Municipal CorporationAct, 1882,  is not in  accordance with modern requirements and wethink  the  section should be repealed. Many  Municipal  Corpora-tions have taken power to have  their accounts audited by Pro-fessional Auditors, and  a  limited  number have  obtained  audit byDistrict Auditors.
  It seems to us wrong that Municipal Corporations should have to &quot;promote special legislation in order to obtain an efficient Audit, andseeing that some of the accounts of all Municipal Corporations arealready audited by District Auditors, i.o., those relating to Educa-tion, the Housing Act of 1919,  Bating and Public Assistance, weare of opinion that all accounts of Municipal Corporations should beaudited by District Auditors.            (7) SAVINGS ON EXISTING DEBT CHARGES.  245. A large amount of the existing debt of  Local Authorities is represented  by loans on mortgage from financial institutions on terms which do not admit of repayment before the expiry of thefull period of the loan.  A  further  large  amount  is represented  by  advances  from thePublic Works Loan Commissioners,  but here again no  saying  to public  funds is  possible.  The  money  needed  for these advanceswas obtained  by the creation of 3 per  cent. Local Loans Stock,which since  the War has been issued at a discount.  The dividendson that Stock are secured firstly on the  interest paid by  the LocalAuthorities on advances from the Local Loans Eund and ultimatelyon the Consolidated Fund of the United  Kingdom.  Any reductionin the interest paid by Local Authorities would mean a correspond-ing reduction in the income of the Local Loans Fund, but thecharge on the Fund in  respect  of  dividends on the  Stock created for the purpose of making the advances  would remain  unchanged;and the  resulting insufficiency of income would have  to be  made good from the Consolidated Fund.  In other words  any reduction in the rate of interest payable  bythe Local Authorities would only mean  a transfer of burden fromthe ratepayer to the taxpayer.  A  substantial  proportion of the debt is represented by  Stockissued either under Local Act powers or under the Stock Begula-tions,  and  the  possibility  of  effecting   savings  under  this  headdepends  on  the date of optional redemption of the  Stock.   Somelarge issues  carrying interest  at - 6 per  cent,  were  made  for  thepurpose  of   financing  housing  schemes  undertaken   under  theHousing, Town Planning, Etc., Act. 1919, but  generally speakingthe optional date for redeeming these issues is not earlier than 1936.  There still remains a very considerable volume of debt, mostly in the form of mortgages, which  can be  converted at short notice.There are no precise figures available but from enquiries which  wehave  made  we are satisfied that an appreciable saving in interest charges  can be effected if Local Authorities  are prompt  to take advantage of their opportunities to convert,  so far  as  Treasury restrictions on optional replacements or other considerations permit.
                      CHAPTER VIII.              AGRICULTURAL  SERVICES.  246. At  the  end of  the Report will be  found  statements(Appendix  V) showing:        (1)  The annual expenditure and income of the Local Autho-    rities in  England and Wales in connection with each agricul-    tural service (excluding  agricultural education)  for the three    years ended 31st March,  1930.,       (2)  The annual net expenditure upon agricultural education    for the four years ended 31st  March, 1931, and  the annual    estimated net expenditure for the two years ending 31st March,    1933.       (3)  Particulars of the number and cost of  the staff of the    Ministry of Agriculture  as provided in  the  estimates  for the    financial year 1932.  We are informed that the total gross expenditure of the Ministryof Agriculture  for the  year 1932  is  estimated  to  amount  to 4,900,000, of which  2,400,000 is  in respect of the Beet SugarSubsidy.  If this sum  be deducted it will be seen that  the totalexpenditure of the Ministry otherwise is estimated at  2,500,000.A statement  showing the analysis of this amount  is contained inAppendix V.                        (1)  ALLOTMENTS.  247. Possibly owing to the  provision of large gardens attached to houses under the new housing schemes of Local  Authorities, thereis a lessened demand for allotments, and the amount expended byAuthorities is decreasing.  We  think that  the  allotments  move-ment  is  a  desirable one  and  that every encouragement should begiven to it, but at the same  time we recommend that the Autho-rities  should possess power  to  deal freely  with  land no longer required for this purpose.                     (2) SMALL HOLDINGS.  248. In  1926 an arrangement was entered into  between theMinistry of Agriculture  and the Local  Authorities  whereby theMinistry of Agriculture undertook to pay year by year to the Autho-rities  a sum which it was estimated would cover the whole of theloss of  the Authorities  on their pre-1926 small holding estates.These  amounts are of a  gradually diminishing quantity the finalpayments are not to be made until  about the year  2000, when theloan charges  will cease.   A sum of approximately  15,000,000 wasadvanced by the Treasury to  the Public  Works Loan Board out ofthe Consolidated Eund and  was lent to the Authorities to enablethem  to purchase and equip the  holdings,  which were providedchiefly for the settlement of ex-service men.   The interest charged
upon the greater part  of these loans was around 6-A-  per cent.  &quot;Ab.a result the payments made by the Ministry to the Authorities andthe payments made by the Authorities for  interest  to the  PublicWorks Loan Board are of  a  very inflated character.   While nosaving would accrue either to  the Authorities or the  Exchequer bya reduction in the rate of interest, the effect of the present arrange-ment is to give an entirely false impression of the  annual cost ofthe land settlement scheme, and for that reason we recommend thatthe rate of interest on these loans be reduced and that a correspond-ing reduction be made in the amounts payable by the Ministry.  249. Nearly the whole of the sum shown as Government  grant for  small holdings is expended on the 1926 settlement.  It wouldappear from the figures given in Appendix &quot;V, Table 1, that therewas a profit upon small holdings; this is due to the sum paid underthe settlement being in excess of immediate loss, the balance  being available to meet the  expenditure that will have to be  incurred on repairs to buildings before the loan period expires.  250. Small holdings  are now acquired under the Small holdings and Allotments Act, 1926, under which the Ministry  of Agriculturehave the power to contribute up to 75 per cent, of the annual lossincurred on approved schemes.   In the estimates for the presentyear a sum of  28,000 only is provided for this purpose.  The Ministry have  emphasized the  necessity  for  restricting tothe lowest  practicable  figure  capital expenditure under  this Actand  since  the 1st  September,  1931,  in  view  of  the  financial stringency, have  given  consent to only 20 schemes,  providing 113holdings, at a total annual  cost to the Ministry of  approximately 2,500.  In view of the importance of agriculture to the State, its presentposition, and the fact that small holdings, in addition to being onthe  whole successful, provide  a valuable  training ground, we  areunable to  recommend  the  complete discontinuance of  financialassistance in the provision of  small toldings.  We  feel, however,that the sum to be expended by  the Ministry and the Local Autho-rities  on these services should,  for the  next three years,  be arestricted one.  We recommend, therefore, that, while it is undesirable  to put acomplete stoppage  to  the  provision  of small holdings by LocalAuthorities, in each of the next three financial years  the continuinganual commitments of the Ministry  upon such schemes should notbe increased by more than  5,000 per annum.  We further recom-mend that  Local Authorities should  be required to  exercise  every possible economy in the provision and erection of buildings, whichshould not be necessarily of the  most substantial character.  251. With regard to the Agricultural  Land  (Utilization) Act,1931, it is admitted that at present no steps are being taken to putits provisions into  operation but  in  our  opinion  the fact that it
remains on the. Statute  Book is a potential source of clanger and expense.  In support of this view it may be pointed out that the Aciprovides for a maximum expenditure by the Minister of a sum of.435,000,000 for acquiring land for use as  demonstration farms andfor purposes of  re-conditioning, apart from such sums  as may berequired in connection with the provision of small holdings underthe Act.  We recommend that the Act should be repealed.                      (3)  LAND DRAINAGE.  252. This is a subject of great difficulty and one that gives riseto sharp  controversy.   As  a result  of  the  passing  of the land drainage  Act, 1930, new Authorities, the Catchment  Boards, havebeen set up with somewhat expensive staffs and a new method ofrating which is causing great discontent.  These Boards have before them four problems :       (1) the maintenance in a proper state of land already drained ;      (2) the carrying out of such works as are necessary to prevent    floods in land adjoining the main river;      (3) the carrying out of further and more extensive  works so    as to provide that further land may be regularly cultivated.      (4) the reclamation  of further land for use for agricultural    purposes.  There is scope here for very heavy  expenditure, but as we under-stand that an amending  Bill is already in preparation we do not feelthat we can usefully make any comments  beyond observing that,while we  feel that  Catchment  and Internal Drainage Boards mustbe required to maintain  in  a proper state of drainage land alre&apos;adycultivated, we consider  that  no  attempt should be  made  at thepresent time to reclaim further land.  253.  Our attention has been drawn to the  delays  and  waste  intravelling, postage, etc., involved in the present procedure withregard to the service of  notices by County Councils under Sections35  (2) and 50 (2) of &quot;the Land Drainage Act, 1930.  It is understoodthat at present  the necessary notice  of remedy in  the case  ofneglected watercourses cannot be  served  until the facts have beenreported to and considered by  the Land Drainage Sub-Committeeand authority to serve the  notice has subsequently been confirmed by the  Agricultural Committee.   As  the latter committee normallymeet only once a  quarter, delays are inevitable, which  not onlycause serious harm to agricultural land  but increase considerablythe costs of administration of  the County Council.  We considerthat economy in administration would be achieved and loss to cropsavoided if the power of  the County Council in re&apos;gard to the serviceof notices under the Sections were delegated to the Chairman orother authorised member of the committee dealing with land drain-age and the chief  responsible  officer, and we  recommend that theprocedure should be amended  accordingly.
                   (4)  DISEASES OF ANIMALS.  254.  We are of the opinion thai&quot; the suppression of the  diseasesof animals is so essential to the live stock industry of the  country that any restriction on the activities of Local Authorities would be undesirable.                  (5) AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.  255.  Generally we are of the opinion that in  view of the import-iinee of agricultural education  to agriculture, it is not possible tomake any considerable  reduction in the cost.  We  feel, however,that the Local Authorities and  the Ministry should carefully review the expenditure on this service with  a  view to ensuring that themoney  is being spent in the directions most beneficial to agriculture.  We refer below to the relationship between the Local Authoritiesand the Ministry and we are of opinion that the question  whetherthis service  should in  future be  aided by block  grants instead ofpercentage grants is one which requires consideration.  Two particular matters which we -have considered are :        (a) whether the  scale of  fees  for Farm Institute  courses,    which vary  widely in different  counties  and in some cases    appear to be  insufficient even to cover the cost of board  and    accommodation, should not be levelled up; and       (6) whether fees should not be invariably  charged for short    day or evening courses.  With regard to the former we recommend that a fee should befixed for each Farm Institute  course  which is  reasonably  approxi-mate to  the estimated  cost per student of the board, lodging andtuition provided; and that every  remission  of such fee, whether in whole  or  in part, should have regard to the capacity of the indi-vidual  student to pay.  With regard to  the latter we consider  thatthe charging of fees for short  courses  of the nature referred to is amatter that should continue to be dealt with in accordance with localconditions.               (6) DESTRUCTION OF EATS AND MICE.  256.  We are of  opinion that this is  a  matter which should bein the  hands of the Sanitary Authorities throughout the country;this would tend both to efficiency and economy of service,  as those authorities already possess officers who  would  be  able to supervise the necessary carrying out of the work.  We recommend, therefore,that the Eats  and Mice (Destruction)  Act,  1919, be so  amended as to provide that the responsibility  for and cost of the work should fall upon the  Sanitary  Authorities.   16766                                                   B  2
             (7) COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMITTBES.  257. Some County Councils have expressed the view that a savin&quot;would be effected in the cost of travelling, postage and other adminis-trative charges if these committees were abolished.  The positionseems to vary very considerably in different areas.  In some their powers are so limited by the County Council as to make their reteu-tion of little value, whilst in others they serve a very useful purpose.  In  all  the  circumstances we think that the option of appointingthese Committees should rest with the individual County Councils.(8)  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND  MINISTRY OF                         AGRICULTURE.  258. We find that the direct control&apos; exercised by  the  Ministryof Agriculture is greatly in excess of that  exercised  by any otherState Department.   In the case of the Agricultural  Committee andin some  instances its Sub-Committees a definite percentage of themembers is appointed by the Minister; in addition, in some countieshis Small Holdings Commissioner attends the meetings of the Agri-cultural  Committee and  of the  Small Holdings  Committee,  hisVeterinary Inspector the meetings of the Diseases of Animals Sub-Committee, and, whether the  Agricultural Education Committeebe a sub-committee of the Agricultural or the Education Committee.his Chief District Education Officer attends  the meetings of that committee and at times brings with him his assistant, or the officerresponsible for poultry keeping, horticulture or dairy  work.  Appendix V, Tables 3 and 4, gives particulars of  the expenditure incurred by the Ministry in connection with the administration ofagricultural services and  shows how  heavy is  the  cost of  depart-mental administration.  It must be remembered, too,  that a con-siderable part of the Authorities&apos;  expenditure is also upon adminis-tration.  No doubt the origin of this detailed control by the ministry was due  to the high proportion of the  grants paid to the money pro-vided locally.  If in these matters the Local  Authorities are not tcbe  trusted it would be preferable for the Ministry to exercise thepowers directly and so save the cost of local administration.   We feel satisfied that economies could be effected which woulJmore than provide for any additional expenditure the Ministry maybe asked to incur, and we recommend that serious attention begiven to this question.   We also express the hope that economy may be secured in theadministration of  the  Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1924.
                       CHAPTER  IX.                    MISCELLANEOUS.                          1. Police.  259. The total cost of the  Police  falling on  rates and grants inthe  year 1929-30 was  20,899,587.  The major  element in  this figure is the cost of Police pay to which  reference has been madein Chapter VII, and in the following paragraphs we draw attentionto a number of other matters which  merit attention.                    (1) AGE  OF RETIREMENT.  260. The May  Committee  pointed out that  police who entered the  service before  1919 are in the majority of forces  qualified fortheir full pension of two-thirds  of pay after 26 years of service later entrants  have to serve  30 years  before full  pension  can beobtained and they drew attention  to the fact that the presentsystem involves a  quite  disproportionate  non-effective  charge  andthat the pension bill is rapidly rising.   They quoted an estimate ofthe  Government Actuary that for  every 100 men on the active listthere will, when stability is  reached,  be  over  60  men on pensionwith a pension charge, after deducting contributions by the men,of 46 per cent, of the salary bill.  They  regarded this as a serious situation calling for immediate action and recommended that the  right of voluntary retirementafter 25 years of service  should be withdrawn from  the  existingpersonnel and that retirement should  not be permitted before theage  of 50 is reached.   They took the view that it would be neces-sary  to  allow,  a period of five  years  before  this  change becameoperative.  261.  We are equally impressed with the seriousness of the situa-tion and we venture  to think that it should be possible to  increasethe  age  at which  retirement might be permitted beyond the figureproposed by the May Committee.  We recognise that police duties are  more onerous in some areasthan others, and we suggest that in  the country districts the policemight reasonably be required to serve  till attaining the age of 60and in  the  more  populous  areas till  55 this to be subject tophysical fitness and  to the pension being secured after 30 years&apos;service.                    (2) AUTOMATIC  SIGNALS.  262.  In urban  areas the  substitution  of automatic methods oftraffic control for control by police officers and  the operation of the&quot; roundabout &quot; system of traffic make  for  economy and  release the  police for their  more important  functions.  We recommendthat efforts should be made to extend the  use of these systems.
                       (3) POLICE BOXES.  263. We believe that where police  boxes have  been introduced the experiment  has been successful and we recommend  that  thesystem should be  further developed.   It has enabled  economies tobe secured through the closing of police stations and in other ways.while still ensuring that any assistance  that  may be  required is available not less speedily than was formerly the case.             (4) MOTOR PATROLS IN RURAL AREAS.  264. It has been represented  to us  that  some expenditure couldbe avoided if a greater degree  of flexibility were introduced intothe requirements  for the purpose  of grants from the Road  fund in connection with motor patrols, and that  arrangements should be permitted for the patrol of rural areas by officers who are  stationed in these areas and own motor vehicles.  We support  these   representations  and  think that a greater measure  of discretion  should be allowed  to the responsible autho-rities in the organisation of motor  patrol work.                          2. General.                        (1)  CONFERENCES.  265. Of recent years there has been a steady growth in  the num-ber of professional, technical or  philanthropic  bodies directly or indirectly associated  with  Local  Government.   Nearly  all  these bodies hold conferences, whether  annual or otherwise, which areattended  in  varying  numbers  by representatives  and officers ofLocal Authorities  whose travelling and  subsistence  expenses aredefrayed  out of the rates.   There are no  particulars of  the totalexpenditure so incurred, but in the aggregate it must  be substantial and  in our view the present practice needs reconsideration.  We think  that the number, of conferences now held is altogethertoo large.  Some of  them  cover  the  same  ground and some takeplace at unnecessarily frequent intervals.   But we go further  than  this.   Even assuming  that the numberof conferences was drastically  reduced and recognising,  as we do that  some of them are of interest and value to persons engaged in local Government, we feel that  save in quite exceptional circum-stances Local  Authorities should not, at the public  expense, send representatives or  officers to conferences (other than those held orconvened by the recognised  Associations of Local Authorities or by statutory bodies such  as County Valuation Committees), but  thatthose who wish to attend should go at their own charge.   In the case of conferences called by  the Associations of LocalAuthorities (as distinct from their annual meetings and conferences&apos;we consider that the representation should .be  limited to two  perAuthority.
  266. Some  Authorities speDd money  out of the rates in enter- taining persons or bodies holding conferences or  other meetings within the district, many of which have no connection at all  with Local  Government.  This  expenditure  is commonly justified  as advertising the amenities of the district and as tending to  attract visitors.  In our view expenditure of this nature should be subject to severe limitations.   There may be exceptional  circumstances where some outlay of public money on a civic welcome to distinguished bodies would not be inappropriate (three or four Authorities have obtained special Parliamentary powers  to  spend money in  this way),  but generally speaking we do not think that the provision of entertain- ment for visiting bodies or conferences ought to involve a  charge on public funds.                     (2) LOCAL  INQUIRIES.  267. Our  attention has been drawn  to  a  number of instances where substantial expenditure out of proportion to the needs of the case has  been incurred by the employment of Counsel  and expert witnesses at Local Inquiries.  We appreciate fully the objection to interfering with the principle that anyone should be allowed to defend his interests in the &quot;manner that he thinks best, but after making full allowance for this we are  of opinion that  unnecessary expense is being incurred by some Authorities.  The  opinion has  been  expressed that  it is  generally the larger Authorities who are  responsible and  that  they are too ready  to retain Counsel as a matter of course on issues with which their own officers could deal quite adequately.  The smaller Authorities in self-defence are driven to follow suit.  All  the  larger  Authorities  employ one or  more whole-time officers of legal training,  and these officers presumably have been responsible for preparing their Council&apos;s case.   In our view  they should  be perfectly competent  to  state it at  the Inquiry and the usual practice should be to require them to do so.  The  case of the small  Authority is more difficult,  and it is no more than natural that some of them, when engaged in controversy with a large and powerful neighbour, should wish to be represented by Counsel.  We considered whether anything could be done in the way of fixing some  limit on the expenditure so to be incurred, but rejected any such solution as impracticable,  and we cannot do more than urge that small Authorities should  take all  possible steps  to keep their expenditure on Local Inquiries  down to the  minimum and  that where it is deemed necessary to have Counsel, not more than one should be retained.  268. When  there is some  technical problem to  be considered,requiring specialised knowledge or experience there may well be advantage in  calling in an expert not only to advise but to justify
recommendations  by his evidence.   There  has,  however, been  atendency in some quarters to  call in the expert  witness to testifyas to facts or  figures, which it should be within the competence ofany  responsible official to supply unaided.  269. We have considered whether the cost of Local  Inquiriesboth in time and money could be reduced by requiring the parties concerned to submit an outline of their case in advance.  something of this sort is provided under the procedure for the review of county districts, under which the  County Council have  to  forward  copiesof their  proposals  to  the other  Authorities  concerned, and those authorities have an opportunity  of  making  representations  to theMinister of Health.  We have no desire,  however, to restrict the&apos; opportunity for individual  ratepayers to  attend  Local Inquiries  and present then-views and  we  recognise that the  introduction of such a requirementmight have the effect of  putting difficulties in the  way of the privateperson stating his  case, or at any rate might increase the cost ofhis so doing.  270. We recommend :        (1)  That any Local Authority which employs a whole-time     legal officer should,  as a  general rule,  abstain  from retaining     Counsel at a  Local  Inquiry.       (2)  That smaller Authorities should wherever  possible he     content to present  their case through  their own  officers and     that where they consider it  imperative  to appear  by  Counsel,     one  only  should be  retained.       (3)  That.expert witnesses should not be employed to produce     or testify as to facts or figures which the officers of the Autho-     rity can satisfactorily supply.       (4)  That the possibility  of reducing  the  cost of Local In-     quiries in time and money  by  improved procedure should be     further considered.                 (3) PRIVATE  BILL  LEGISLATION.   271. It  would  be lacking  in  a  sense of proportion  to  devote attention to Local Inquiries and to  pass over in silence  the much more expensive item of  Private Bill  legislation.   We do  not lightly contemplate any restriction on the right  of Local Authorities to approach  Parliament whenever they deem it necessary,  either to promote or defend their interests.   Moreover, the whole  subject has  recently been under considera- tion by a  Select Committee of the House of  Commons, who recom- mended amongst  other  things  that, with  a view  to  diminishing the  bulk of local  legislation, Public  General Bills should  be intro- duced and passed  approximately every five  years so as to embody in the general law and  make of general application powers granted by  Parliament as  a matter of course in Local Acts.
  We have noted, however, a number of instances where  LocalAuthorities have  promoted  Private Bills  with  rather  surprisingfrequency.  Bor example one Local Authority  has obtained 22 Local Actssince 1900, another 18  (9 in  8  years), another 17  (7 in 8  years)aud another 15.  Yet another has obtained 7 in the last 9  years.  Circumstances no doubt differ and each Local Authority has itsown problems,  but it seems to  us  that it ought to be possible toavoid such frequent  application to Parliament  without impairingthe efficiency of local  administration.                         (4) PRINTING.  272.  We doubt whether all the  reports called  for both by theGovernment Departments and  the Local Authorities  themselvesarc necessary.  Some of them  are over elaborate and  there is atendency in some cases to introduce  arguments on policy and togo beyond a reasonable presentation of fact.  We consider  that Local Authorities should thoroughly overhaultheir expenditure on  printing,  and we  believe that if this were done  a  considerable  amount  of  avoidable  expense  could  be eliminated.  We cite three examples only :      (a)  Many of the Treasurers&apos; so  called abstracts consist of    bulky volumes of 500  pages  or  more  containing  a mass of   figures.     Section  27 of  the  Municipal  Corporations  Act, 1882, re-   quires  that the  Treasurer  shall  print  a full  abstract   of his   accounts for each year but we cannot think that such elaborate   figures as  it has now  become  customary  to publish   were   intended.     We consider  also that there  would  be advantage  if the   financial statements could be so drawn up as to facilitate com-   comparisons between  one  Authority and another.      (6)  The  reports  of  some Regional  Planning  Committees   have  been published  in a form  which,  though  certainly   attractive and artistic,  seems  to  us to be  altogether too ex-   pensive.  Indeed, in so far  as the object of their  publication   has been to stimulate public interest we should have thought   that  they would  largely  defeat  that  object  since  the   price   would deter the  ordinary  purchaser.  Reports published in a   cheaper form  have in some instances sold enough copies to pay   for themselves.     (c) We refer  to what is said in  paragraph 195  with  refer-   ence to the Reports of Medical Officers of Health.                 (5) PRESS ADVERTISEMENTS.  273.  We think there should be  a  review  of  the  numerousstatutory  provisions   governing  the  advertisements   by   LocalAuthorities in the Public Press.  Generally the object  underlying
these provisions is to give the ratepayer or private citizen reason-able notice of any proposal which may affect  him, e.g. an  applica-tion for a Provisional Order increasing market tolls or water rents.  We do not question the propriety of giving such notice but itseems to us that it should be  possible to secure  economy  while still preserving the position of the private  citizen, e.g.  by  sub-stituting for the detailed statements at present  required (some ofwhich occupy  several columns of an ordinary newspaper) a briefoutline of what is proposed, together with  an intimation that  full details can  be obtained on application to  the offices of  the LocalAuthority.  There are other instances, e.g. of compulsory purchase of land or private street works  where individual notice is already required tobe  served on all owners and occupiers, and  we do not see  whyfurther public notice  is essential.  In other cases the statutory  advertisements could be  much cur-tailed or dispensed with altogether.  A further means of saving would be for  Local Authorities to refrain from inserting the same  advertisement in more newspapersthan necessary. If there are several papers circulating in the samedistrict,  the  position can be met by the Local  Authority placingits advertisements on a rota system.  In a different category are the notices advertising appointmentsor inviting tenders.   It is not unusual to see in the  same issue of a newspaper several  notices or advertisements  inserted by different departments of the  same Authority, each perhaps headed by  theAuthority&apos;s  arms, and some of them entering  into unnecessarilyelaborate detail.  For example, if applications for a post are beinginvited it ought to suffice to state the fact  quite briefly and  to letintending applicants get the  necessary-y  information by  enquiringat the office of the Local Authority.  We think that savings could be made  if  more attention  was devoted  to  this question  and that  there  would be advantage ir.making some one officer of the Local Authority  responsible for al!advertisements inserted in the  press.        (6) FOOD  AND  DRUGS (ADULTERATION) ACT, 1928.  274. We  regard  the work performed by Authorities  under  thisAct  as a valuable public health  service.  We think, however, thatsome economy might be effected without  loss of  efficiency by an extended use of the practice of informal sampling and  testing ofcertain articles by the Inspectors of  Food and Drugs.  This process is suitable  for  only  a limited number of  article;.principally  milk,  but  we are  advised  that it has been operatedsuccessfully in a number of areas and has resulted in an appreciablesaving in analysis fees.
     (7,i  REGISTRARS  OK BIRTHS, DEATHS  AND MARRIAGES.  275.  We consider that the scale of salaries prescribed for these officers by the Registrar General is  unreasonably  high in  relationto those paid to  Local Government Officers generally and that theestablishment  of uniform  scales of pay  for  them  is  open  to objection.  The  Registrars are in an anomalous  position since, though theLocal  Authorities  are responsible for their appointment  and re:numeration,  they  work under and for the Registrar General.However that may be,  so long as they  are appointed  and  paid bythe Local Authorities we think it only  reasonable that  the  LocalAuthorities should have discretion in fixing their remuneration.                (S) PETTY SESSIONAL DIVISIONS.  276.  We recognise the need for Courts of Summary Jurisdictionto be readily accessible,  but we think that there would be advantage in a review of Petty Sessional Divisions.  In view of the great  increase in traffic facilities in  recent years it rnajr well be that some of the Courts might be found to be redundancies-dant and we recommend that  this matter should  receive  theattention of Quarter Sessions.                 (9)  SEPARATE POLICE   COURTS.  277.  We understand  that in many instances two separate PoliceCourts are maintained in the area of a Borough, one for the use ofthe County Justices and one for the use  of Borough Justices, wherethe same Police  Force is employed for the two areas.  This in our opinion leads to unnecessary expenditure and in such areas the two bodies of magistrates  should he required to use thesame Court, arrangements being made  for the sittings to be heldat different times.                  (10)  REGISTER OF ELECTORS.  278.  The scale of registration expenses is fixed  by the treasury under  Section 15 of the Representation of the People Act, 1918,and the expenses are shared equally between the Exchequer andthe Local Authority.   The  expenses allowed to  the  registration officer for the employment of Rating Officers are on  a  graduatedscale, which  has the Parish as  its  basis.  Where  there  is morethan one Civil Parish in an Urban area  there would be a decreasein cost if the unit taken  for  the  purpose of the  scale was the urban  area instead of  the  Parish,  and  w-e recommend that theRegulations should be amended accordingly.               (11) COST OF COUNCIL ELECTIONS.  279.  We find, comparing like with like, a very wide divergencein the  cost of Council  Elections, the amount  expended in some areas being almost double that expended in other similar areas.
  Each Authority should consider the rates of payment at, presentin force and bring into operation scales of payment on lines similarto those adopted  by a large majority of the Municipal  Authorities.with the necessary adjustments where  there is considerable travel-ling or where the hours of  attendance have to be lengthened.                       CHAPTER  X.     SUMMARY  OF RECOMMENDATIONS  AND                      CONCLUSIONS.  280. We  append  a  summary of  our   recommendations  and conclusions.                 CHAPTER I.-Introduction.  There should be a halt in legislation involving Local Authoritiesin fresh expenditure (paragraph 10).  Block grants should be  substituted where possible for percent-age grants and steps should be taken to work out systems appiic-able to the various services which at present receive percentagegrants (paragraph 13).                  CHAPTER  II.-Education.                   ELEMENTARY EDUCATION.  Closure of  schools. Section  19 of  the  Education  Act, 1921,should be repealed and provision made under  which authorities may submit  proposals to the Board of  Education for the betterorganisation of their elementary school system (paragraph 23).  Amalgamation  of small departments. In rural areas Authoritiesshould survey their small departments with the object  of obtainingeconomies through amalgamation wherever possible.   In populousurban  areas departments with  150 children or less  should not  asa rule be permitted to continue a separate existence (paragraph 24).  Reduction of school staffs. Scrutinies of  staffing should be under-taken  with a view to  raising  the ratio of the number of pupilsper teacher to 30 children  per teacher in  County areas  and  36.5children  per  teacher in urban areas.   200  children  in  averageattendance should as a rule be the  minimum size of department in which the head teacher  is free from full-time charge of a  class.  The reduction  in the teaching staffs should be effected in  threeannual stages.  Authorities  should be  empowered  to  give  directions to  the managers of  all  schools, provided and non-provided  regarding  the admission of children to their  schools (paragraphs 25 and 26).
  Fees In elementary schools. The  charging of  a  fee in ordinaryelementary  schools  would be  impracticable but a fee  might becharged  to  children attending  selective  central  schools whoseparents are in a position to pay (paragraph 28).                     SECONDARY EDUCATION.  Closure of schools. The Board of Education  should,  wherever practicable,  take action  to induce the closure of small secondary schools i.e. schools with up to 150 pupils on the roll (paragraph 30).  Reduction of school staffs. A revision of secondary school  staffs should be undertaken with a view to raising the ratio of pupils toteachers, the standard to be attained should be between 21.5 and22 pupils to one assistant teacher.  Wherever the nature of  the  building  permits  Authorities and(Governing Bodies should be allowed  to increase  the size of juniorforms up to 35 at their own  discretion.  The Board of Education^ capitation grant to direct grant schoolsshould be modified  so as to ensure that a proportionate  reduction is made  in  those schools in the ratio of  pupils to teachers (para-graphs 34 and 35).  Concentration  of  advanced  work. Economy  could  be  effectedeither  by removing  all the older pupils  and concentrating them ina  few selected  schools or by  restricting  the number of  types of advanced work  done  in each  school and  Authorities  should  berequired  to  take  action  on these lines (paragraph 36).              TECHNICAL AND  FURTHER EDUCATION.  Increase of fees in evening classes. Authorities should under-take a revision  of  the  fees charged for evening  classes havingregard to (a) the cost to  the Authority of providing the class, and(b) the ability of students to pay (paragraph  37).  Increased fees in day  classes. Fees for  junior day  courses in technical and commercial schools, art schools, etc.,  should be raised and arrangements for the admission of free pupils should be revisedwith a view to securing that a fee is paid if the parent can afford it.In those schools which at present are entirely  free a fee shouldhe imposed.  The possibility of  increasing the fee in senior courses in technical and other schools giving education of a  post secondary type shouldhe considered (paragraph 38).  Voluntary bodies  -working  under  the Adult Education Regula-tions. Authorities  should consider  whether  a  reduction of,  say,10 per cent, could  not be made in their grants in aid  of bodiescarrying  on Adult Education work (paragraph 39).  Closure of evening classes at Easter. Authorities should requirethe closure  of  classes at Easter except in  the  case of classes for
students who are working for examinations and in  any other cir-cumstances where appreciable hardship would be inflicted by closureearlier than is at present, the rule (paragraph 40).  Small evening  classes. Authorities should require  the  amalga-mation or  closure of classes where the numbers in attendance fall below  a minimum sufficient to justify the expense of maintaining the class (paragraph 41).  Regional  co-ordination  of  technical  instruction. Authoritiesshould  be  encouraged to co-operate  for  the  more  economical useof their respective resources in the giving of technical instruction(paragraph 42).                       AID  TO STUDENTS.  Maintenance allowances. Authorities  should undertake  a fullrevision of their scales for the assessment  of need  (paragraph 43;.  Intending  teacher awards  to pupils  in  secondary schools. Allspecial awards made on the understanding that the holder should enter the  teaching profession  should  forthwith  be  discontinued atleast up to the age when pupils have passed the School Certificateexamination  and  in the awards made to pupils beyond that  stage in secondary  schools those given  to intending teachers should notbe greater  in value than those given to other pupils (paragraph 44).  Loans instead of grants to students. Authorities should considerthe possibility of making loans rather than grants to  students (para-graph  45).                        SPECIAL SERVICES.  General. An  investigation by Authorities  into  their  expendi-ture under each of the various special services with a view  to ascer-taining whether the cost is justified  by  the  amount of  work donewill be amply repaid.  A detailed  and far-reaching inquiry by a Central Authority intothe  whole of the school medical service is  now  required (para-graphs 46  and 47).     -                      -                    SCHOOL MEDICAL SERVICE.   Cost of  medical inspection. The  striking variations in the costof&apos; medical inspection in various areas should  be the subject  of immediate inquiry.  Special inspection (and treatment) should notbe limited to the time of the school session.   The figures obtained of the average number of inspections andtreatments per  session carried out  by  school  dentists in variousareas  call  for immediate investigation.
                              143                                   yeo  Schedules should be drawn up  for the guidance of school dentistsindicating what points should be looked to  in dental  inspectionsand  the different lines  of treatment  that  should be  adopted indifferent circumstances.  There should be only one routine medical inspection in secondary schools.  Special inspections should remain as at present.  Instances in which the proportion of tonsils  and adenoids opera-tions performed  is  above the average should be investigated toascertain whether the unusually high  rate is justified  by unusualincidence of disease.  A further matter  for investigation is that  some hospitals chargedifferent fees  to  different  authorities for  the same services  (para-graphs 48-51).  Special Schools. The Board of Education should  look into thepossibility  of  closing  some Deaf  and Blind  Besidential SchoolsWith a  view to obtaining some  reduction in the average cost pet-head .  Certifying Medical  Officers in interpreting  the Education  Act,1921, with reference to mentally deficient children should bear inmind the provision now  made  in  re-organised  schools  for lower grade children.  In present  financial circumstances  further  development in theprovision for  mentally deficient  children in  special  schools shouldbe postponed  (paragraphs 52 and 53).  The variation in  the amount of the  cost of treatment and mealsrecovered by different  Authorities requires investigation with a viewto an increase in the amounts recovered (paragraph 54).  Medical research. Special  researches as  distinct from compila-tions based on evidence obtained in the ordinary course of medicalinspection and treatment should not be initiated without  priorreference to the medical department  of the  Board  of Education (paragraph 56).                            GENERAL.  Administration and  inspection. The differences  in the cost  ofadministration  and inspection   between Authorities  should be investigated with a view to obtaining a greater degree of uniformity (paragraph 57).  School attendance  officers. School attendance staffs  could bereduced by about 400 officers over the country  as a  whole (para-graph 58).  Remuneration of  occasional teachers. Authorities should review their rates of pay for occasional teachers (paragraph 59).  Provision of substitute teachers. Authorities should  review their arrangements regarding the  supplying of substitute teachers.   Itshould not be taken as a  matter of course that a substitute shouldbe  sent  to replace an  absent teacher (paragraph  60).
                    ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY.   Part III Authorities. The subject of Part III Authorities shouldbe the subject of an immediate investigation (paragraph 62).                   CHAPTER III.-Housing.   Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924. No further  applica-tions involving subsidy under this Act should  be entertained andthe Act should be repealed.  Until 31st March, 1933, the Ministerof Health should be empowered to approve for subsidy such limited number of houses as may be  necessary to liquidate commitmentsor  quasi-commitments into   which Local Authorities  may have entered (paragraph 81).   Houses for Aged Persons. If it is decided to continue-exchequer subsidy,  the  amount  should  be halved  and made conditional on a fixed contribution equivalent to  1 5s. Od. per house per annum for 40 years being made from the rates (paragraph 82).   Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926  and 1931. The more wide-spread use of  the facilities provided by these Acts should be en-couraged, and  further consideration should be given to the relaxation-tion of  some  of the  conditions and to the question  of the most appropriate authority for administering the Acts (paragraph 83).  Housing Act, 1930.- A reduction should be made in  the  Ex-chequer  subsidy and  rate contribution  commensurate  with the substantial reductions  which  have  taken place  in  the  cost ofbuilding and  the rate of interest.  The reduced subsidy and rate contribution should be fixed sumsin respect of  each house- provided  in  discharge of the rehousingobligation (paragraph 85).  Housing (Rural Authorities) Act, 1931. Applications in respectof more  than  2,000 houses  should not be entertained  under thisAct  (paragraph 86).  More Economical  Building. The possibilities  of more  econo-mical  building are  pointed  out  and  attention is  drawn  topages 281-2 of the Annual Report of the Ministry of Health  for1931-32 (paragraph 87).   Consolidation of subsidies. The power to make agreements withthe Minister  of  Health for consolidating  subsidy  under the act of 1919 should be extended to subsidies under the Acts  of 1923and 1924.  It  should  be  a condition of any such agreement thatthe restrictive rent  conditions  under the  Act  of  1924 should be abolished in regard to existing houses.   Consideration should be given to the question  of amending thelaw so as to enable agreements for a limited period to be made.
  Any savings which may be secured by reborrowing at lower ratesof interest or a revision  of  rents or otherwise  should  be sharedequitably  between the Exchequer and the Local Authority  (para-graph 93).  Management and  allocation of accommodation. The following principles should  be observed :   -       (a) Subsidies should not be wasted by being  given to  those    who do not need them.       (b) Every reasonable endeavour should be made to increase    the revenue obtainable or to reduce the loss arising from housing    estates, by requiring tenants who can  afford it either to pay    higher rents or in some cases to buy their houses, or to vacate    their houses which would thus become available  either  for    sale in  the open market or for accommodating poorer workers    who are unable to provide for themselves.       (c) Accommodation should not  be wasted as, for example,    where a 3 bedroomed  house is occupied by a tenant  whose    family  is not&apos; such  as  to  need  the  accommodation  (para-    graph 95).  Means of Tenants. The question  is one which requires the care-ful  and immediate investigation of  every Local Authority  (para-graph 96).  Sale of Houses and  Revision  of Rents. The question of salesis closely  connected with the rentals  at which houses are at presentlet.  The position in each district should  be  reviewed  in the light(if all  the circumstances, including the  housing needs and con-ditions  of the district,  and  sales should  not necessarily be on  thebasis of the existing subsidised rents.  The advice of the Valuation Department  should  be obtained asto the extent to which a revision of rents or sales  of houses maybe practicable in the local circumstances.  In general the policy  of sales should be encouraged and  thefacilities  for (purchase  should be made widely  known  by  LocalAuthorities  (paragraph 97).              CHAPTER IV.-Roads and  Bridges.  Maintenance  and minor  improvements. By  a  further carefulscrutiny  of  their  estimates,  Highway  Authorities   can   makeadditional savings amounting to  upwards of   2  million per annum (paragraph 116).  Major  improvement  and  neio  construction. Local  Authoritiesshould  make yet another survey of the works of major improve-nient and new construction  now  in progress to see if any additional savings can be made (paragraph 119).
  Methods and  management. Considerable savings can be madeby the more general application of modern methods, e.g. by theintroduction of costing systems wherever possible, and by  frequentperiodical comparisons of unit costs (paragraph 121).  The practice of advertising publicly for tenders should normally be followed in connection with the resurfacing of roads and similar work.  Where an Authority has a Works Department of its ownfor this class of  work, public tenders should periodically be invitedand  the  Works  Department should be  required to tender on thesame basis as any one else (paragraph 122).  There  should  be  a more frequent  examination  of expenditureon staff,  with the  object of securing reductions  where  changed circumstances and conditions may have resulted in decreased  re-responsabilities and  less administrative work (paragraph  123).  Heavy  traffic  on  roads. There  should be  more effective  opera-tion  by  Highway  Authorities generally of the powers  conferred upon them by the Boad Traffic Act to check the laden weights of heavy motor vehicles.  This would result in  a considerable  saving in highway expenditure  (paragraph 125).  We agree  with  the  proposals  of  the Conference on  Bail andBoad Transport for        (1) the prohibition, on  a  more extensive scale, of the use     of lightly constructed minor  roads  by heavy vehicles, and       (2) the carrying by goods vehicles of a log book, or record     of the journey showing the weight and  nature of. the load     carried, the working time of  the  drivers etc. (paragraph 126).  Experimental icork. The Ministry of  Transport should continue and  develbp its  experimental work on methods of construction and use of materials (paragraph 127).  If  statutory effect is  given  to  the  proposals of  the Conferenceon Bail and Boad Transport for additional taxation of commercialgoods vehicles using the highway, any further revenue  that maybe received together with any saving accruing to the Boad Bundfrom the reduction effected in Highway expenditure should notbe diverted to other channels but  should be  devoted to the assisr-ance of Highway Authorities, including County Boroughs,  in  theform of increased grants in order to diminish the call upon  theratepayer (paragraph 128).                 CHAPTER V.-Public Health.        SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY SANITARY AUTHORITIES.   Seiverage and  seioage  disposal. There should  be greater  co-operation between neighbouring Authorities (paragraph 142).   The  establishment of a  costing system for disposal  works islikely to bring  about a  reduction in  the costs  of maintenance(paragraph 144).
  Refuse collection and disposal. The system of costing introduced by  the Ministry  of  Health  should be  continued  and extended(paragraph 147).  The cost  of collecting  trade refuse should  be a charge on the traders concerned  (paragraph 148).  Street cleansing. Accurate records of cost are essential in theinterests of economy in this service (paragraph 149).  Parks,  pleasure  grounds and  open spaces. Costly schemes oflay-out should be avoided (paragraph 152).  Baths  and  washhouses. Scales of charges  should be reviewed.  There is no necessity for the provision of baths other than  swim-ming and slipper baths.  Greater economy should  be  secured in future building  (para-graph 153).  Infectious  diseases  hospitals. Greater efficiency  and economycould  be  secured  by  co-operation  between  neighbouring  Autho-rities (paragraph 155)..  Steps should  be  taken  to give  effect to the intention  of subsec-tion 3 (a) of section 63 of the Local Government Act, 1929  (para-graph 155).  In many  districts the  routine  period of isolation  for  uncompli-cated  cases  of  scarlet fever is  longer  than is necessary  (para-graph 159).  Terminal  disinfection  has often little medical  value and thepractice   should be   reconsidered  by  Local  Authorities   (para-graph 162).SERVICES ADMINISTERED  BY COUNCILS OE  COUNTIES AND  COUNTY                           BOROUGHS.  Mental hospitals. The  standards of accommodation required should be reconsidered (paragraph 163).  Mental hospitals should be  reserved for  persons in  need of mental treatment (paragraph 164).  Attention  should be given to  the financial side of occupationaltherapy (paragraph 165).  Full control  of  expenditure should  vest  in the Council  (para-graph 166).  Mental deficiency. The  standards  of accommodation  required should be reconsidered (paragraph 169).  Full use  should  be made of the system  of guardianship  (para-graph 171).  Tuberculosis. More discrimination  should be exercised  in the selection  of  cases for residential  treatment,  particularly   in the intermediate  stages of the  disease and in children (paragraphs 173and 174).   Venereal  disease. -Where circumstances  permit  clinics  should-have separate sessions at  which charges are made  for treatment(paragraph  176).
   Maternity and child welfare. Health  visitors  should only beemployed on work where their special qualifications are necessary(paragraph  177).   Maintenance costs in maternity homes  are  frequently excessiveand should  be  reduced  (paragraph 178).   More discrimination  should be exercised in  the  assistance  given at welfare clinics (paragraph 179).   The work of ante-natal clinics should be properly co-co-ordinated with maternity work (paragraph 179).   There should be some  restriction in the scope of day nurseries(paragraph  180).                            GENERAL.   There should  be  an  immediate inquiry into building costs  ofinstitutions  and, when  suitable standards  have been determined.action  should be taken  to secure that they are observed in future(paragraph 183).   Careful consideration should be given to the feasibility of estab-lishing standards of maintenance  costs (paragraph 184).   Institutional treatment should be reserved for cases which cannotadequately be treated otherwise (paragraph 185).   Large economies could be secured in  expenditure on  hospitalsupplies by simplifying and standardising the  articles  required and  by central  purchasing (paragraphs 186-190).   Persons able to pay  should be  required, as a rule, to contribute to the  costs of the service provided for them  (paragraph 191).   Comparative statements of costs are of  real value but the  func-tions of the Ministry of Health should not be  limited to collectingand  publishing them (paragraphs  193  and 194).               CHAPTER VI.-Public Assistance.                       INSTITUTIONAL RELIEF. .   The  need for proper  scrutiny of costs applies as much  to  poorlaw  as to other institutions  (paragraph 210).   The  circumstances of every person  receiving institutional  reliefshould be regularly and thoroughly investigated (paragraph 212).  The  practice of- boarding-out children eligible for this form  of relief should be more extensively  adopted  (paragraph 213).   The  appropriation of poor  law  institutions as public healthhospitals should  not under present financial conditions  be undulypressed (paragraph 217).  The  standard of accommodation in Home Office  certified schoolsshould  not for the present be improved (paragraph  218).                    PROVISION FOR CASUALS.  There should be no further suspension of the Minister&apos;s Regula-tions requiring the  detention of  casuals for  two  nights  and theimposition of a task during the intervening day (paragraph 219).
                                                                  371                          OUT RELIEF.  (a) The  Minister of Health should be empowered to  supersedeany  Local Authority who do not, or do not efficiently  carry out their duties in administering  poor  relief (paragraph  225).  This, while essential, is at best a palliative and we are of opinionthat the responsibility of granting  relief to the able  bodied shouldbe removed altogether from the purview of Local Authorities (para-graph 226).  Full examination should be given to the question  of placing thedistribution of relief to the able-bodied unemployed and the opera-tion  of the means test  in  connection with transitional  payments in the hands of independent persons (paragraph 227).  (b) The  following recommendations are submitted with a view to making the present  arrangements for the administration of  out-relief more efficient.  (i)  An adequate investigation staff is essential for the economicaladministration of out-relief.  (ii) A person receiving relief should not  be in as good  a positionas he would be when employed.  (iii) Where scales  of  relief have been  adopted  they should be reviewed in the light of present circumstances, including the re-duction in the cost of living.  (iv)  The statutory provision in Section 48 of the Poor  Law Act,1930,  that Councils  in  granting out-relief should not  take  intoconsideration the  first 7s.  6d. of Health Insurance  benefit or thefirst  5s. of Friendly Society benefit should be repealed.  (v) The  resources of  an  applicants family  should be  reckoned as those of a single unit.  (vi)  The practice  of  granting relief automatically to  bring anapplicants income up to an agreed minimum is,  in certain partsof the Country, causing  a  large amount of  waste.  (vii) The requirement of work as a condition of  out-relief to theable-bodied is an economy.  (viii) The practice  of offering, in appropriate cases, institutionalinstead of out-relief should be revived and extended (paragraph 228).                     POOR LAW ACT, 1930.  Certain amendments  of the Poor Law  Act,  1930, are desirable(paragraph 229).     CHAPTER VII.-General Organisation and Financial                        Administration.                     SALARIES AND WAGES.  TeacherS increments should be biennial during the first ten yearsof service.  This recommendation is conditional on the further reduc-tion  of 5 per cent, in Police pay (paragraph 235).  A  substantial reduction can  and should  be  made in   the totalcost  of the administrative  charges  of Local Authorities (paragraph237).
  Every Local Authority should  review  the  whole of its work and staff.  (a)  Many instances will be found where  the staff is in  excessof present  requirements and should be reduced.  (b)  In many  instances salaries,  more particularly of the  highly paid officers, should be reviewed in the light of  present day  con-ditions.    Some  incremental   scales  might   be  considerablylengthened.  (c)  The  wages of manual workers  should likewise be reviewed in the light of present conditions and the wages  paid  by the  bestclass  of  employers to workmen  on comparable work.  Including savings made as a  result of  action already taken byLocal Authorities  the salaries and  wages bill of Local  Authorities(exclusive   of   Teachers  and   Police)   could   be  reduced  by approximately five million pounds below  the figures for the  year1930/31  (paragraph 237).  Compensation Addition  of years. The  existing law requiresamendment so as to permit  of  discretion being  used  in deciding whether and if so  what number of years should be  added in deter-mining compensation (paragraph 238).                   FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION.  There would be advantage in estimates  of the total revenue and capital expenditure of Local Authorities being presented to Parlia-government  at the same  time and in respect  of the same period  as theBudget (paragraph 239).  Local  Authorities,  in considering capital estimates,  should haveregard to the capital expenditure likely  to be incurred during thenext three or five years (paragraph 240).  The practice  of defraying small items of capital  expenditureout of revenue should  be encouraged.  Generally the practice should be that  items of this nature whichit may be necessary to incur in the course of a  year  should be defrayed from revenue to the extent of the product of not less  thana 2d.  rate  (paragraph 241).  The periods allowed for the repayment  of loans  should be  kept under review and the tendency should  be in the direction of shorterloan periods (paragraph. 242).  All  Authorities should be required by Statute to appoint FinanceCommittees with powers and duties similar to those of  the FinanceCommittees of County Councils (paragraph 243).  The Audit of Accounts by elective auditors is not in accordancewith  modern  requirements.   All accounts of Municipal  Corpora-tions  should be  audited by District Auditors (paragraph 244).  Local  Authorities  should  take  advantage  of  opportunities  to convert  their existing  debt  so as  to  save interest charges (para-graph 245).
                                                                    9 rj ,9                              151                                     * &amp; .            CHAPTER  VIII.-Agricultural Services.  Allotments. Authorities  should possess power to  deal  freelywith laud no longer required for allotments (paragraph 247).  Small  holdings. In order to present a true picture the rate ofinterest payable in respect of the pre-1926 small holdings should bereduced and a corresponding reduction made in-the  Ministry ofAgriculture&apos;s contribution (paragraph 24S).  In each of the next three financial years the annual commitments of the Ministry of  Agriculture upon  small holdings should not beincreased by more than  5,000 per annum (paragraph  250).  Local  Authorities should be required to exercise every possibleeconomy in the provision and  erection of buildings,  which shouldnot be necessarily of the most substantial character (paragraph 250)..  The Agricultural  Land (Utilisation)  Act,  1931, should be  re-pealed (paragraph 251).  Land  Drainage. While  Catchment   and  Internal  DrainageBoards must maintain in a proper state of drainage  land alreadycultivated  no attempt  should be  made  at the  present  time toreclaim further  land (paragraph  252).  The existing procedure with regard to the  service of notices by county Councils under  sections 35  (2)  and  50  (2)  of the  land drainage Act, 1930, should be amended so as to  enable the powersto be delegated to the chairman or other authorised member of theCommittee  dealing  with  land  drainage and the  chief responsibleofficer (paragraph 253).  Agricultural education. Fees for Farm Institute courses shouldbe  fixed at a figure which is  reasonably  approximate to  the esti-mated cost  per student of the  board, lodging  and tuition provided.Demission of fees should have regard to the capacity of the studentto  pay (paragraph  255).  Destruction  of rats and  mice. The Bats and Mice  (Destruc-tion) Act, 1919, should be amended so as to place the responsibilityfor and the cost of  this work upon the  Sanitary Authorities  (para-graph 256).  County  Agricultural  Committees. The  option of appointingthese Committees should rest  with the individual County Councils (paragraph 257).   Relationship between Local Authorities and Ministry of Agricul-ture. Attention should  be  given to  the  cost of  departmentaladministration and supervision (paragraph 258).                 CHAPTER IX.-Miscellaneous.                             POLICE.   Age  of Retirement. The Police might reasonably  be required,subject to certain  conditions,  to serve till attaining the age of 60 in  the country districts and 55  in the  more  populous areas  (para- graph 261).
  Traffic control. The use of automatic methods of traffic controland of &quot; roundabout &quot; systems should be extended (paragraph 262).  Police Boxes. The system of Police  Boxes should be developed(paragraph 263).  Motor Patrols. More discretion  should be  allowed to LocalAuthorities  in the organisation of  motor patrols  in rural  areas(paragraph 264).                           General.  Conferences. Local Authorities  should  not, save in quite excep-tional  circumstances, send representatives or officers at  the public-expense to conferences other than those  convened by the recognisedAssociations of Local Authorities (paragraph 265).  The representation at conferences convened by the Associations(as distinct from  their  annual meetings  and conferences) shouldnot exceed two  per Authority (paragraph 265).  Generally Local Authorities  should not spend public money inentertaining bodies who hold conferences or meetings within thedistrict (paragraph 266).  Local Inquiries. Local Authorities who employ whole time legalofficers should generally abstain from retaining  Counsel.  Smaller Authorities should  present their case  through their ownOfficers wherever  possible.  Where  it is  considered imperative to appear by Counsel, only one should be retained.  Expert witnesses  should-not be employed to produce or testifyas to  facts  and figures which the  officers of the  Authority  cansatisfactorily supply.  The possibility of reducing the cost of Inquiries by improved pro-cedure should be further considered (paragraph 270).  Private Bill  Legislature. Some  Authorities  promote  PrivateBills  with surprising frequency.  It ought to be possible  to avoidsuch frequent application to Parliament (paragraph  271).  Printing. Local Authorities should  overhaul  their expenditureon  Printing,  particularly  with regard  to  the  number  and scopeof Beports presented  (paragraph 272).  Press  Advertisements. There  should  be  a review  of  thestatutory  provisions  governing   Bress   advertisements.  Bothstatutory and other advertisements could be  simplified  or cur-tailed  (paragraph  273).   Food  and  Drugs  (Adulteration)  Act,  1928. The  practice of taking informal samples might  be extended (paragraph 274).  Registrars of Births, Deaths and  Marriages. Local Authoritiesshould have discretion in fixing the remuneration of these officers.The  salary scales prescribed  by  the  Begistrar-General  are  un-reasonably high (paragraph 275).
  Petty Sessional Divisions. There might, with advantage, be a review of Petty Sessional Divisions (paragraph 276).  Separate Police  Courts. Unnecessary  expenditure  is incurredthrough the maintenance of two separate Police Courts for Gountyand Borough Justices in some  Boroughs which are served by theCounty Police (paragraph 277).  Register of Electors. Where there is more  than  one  CivilParish in an  Urban area  the  scale of expenses  allowed for theemployment of Bating Officers  should not be on a Parochial basis(paragraph 278).  Cost of Council Elections. The scales of payment allowed shouldbe readjusted  (paragraph 279).  281. Our task has been greatly simplified by the assistance thathas been given  to  us  by the members of the Civil  Service whohave  been  attached to our  various sub-committees and we wishto express to them  our sincerest thanks.  To  our Secretary, Mr. T.  H. iSheepshanks, we are particularlyindebted.  His work has been  of the highest order, and we wishto place on  record  our thanks  to him  for  the zeal and ability hehas shown in carrying out his  task.                                     WM.

                     RESERVATIONS.      (1)  Reservation to Chapter  II, Paragraph  28.  We dissent from this recommendation because we are opposedto any  abrogation of the  general  principle of free elementary education.  We hold  the view that  the higher standard of  educa-tion  given in the  Selective Central  Schools  is no justification forcharging a fee in  these schools as they are within the  framework of the Elementary Education system.                                     JOSEPH JONES.                                     E. G. ROWLTNSON.                                     PERCIVAL BOWER.      (2) Reservation  to Chapter  II,  Paragraph 30.  I dissent from this recommendation.  While agreeing  with mycolleagues that some small Secondary Schools are costly I  doubt whether much economy  would be effected  by their closure and  no estimate has been submitted in this connection.   And 1  feel con-vinced  that the  recommendation is  specially inadvisable in  thecase of  the Brincipality where  the conditions of Secondary Educa-tion are rather  different from those  in  England.  On the  whole the parents of Welsh Secondary School pupils are poorer, and tohave to send their children further afield for their higher educationwould mean added expenditure for them and  an additional  hard-ship upon the children.  Again, it is not unusual for small Schoolsto do good  advanced work and  this year in the smallest WelshSchool 3 Higher Certificates were gained.  In others of the smallerrural Schools successful  efforts have  been made to relate the  in-struction to the needs of the  district  a  policy to be fostered  andnot  disturbed.   In  the  Principality  where  there  are very  smallschools  the nearest schools are  generally  crowded and so the  actual cost of  transfer  would be still  greater.   I  am therefore of opinionthat the recommendation  is of doubtful value both to education and economy particularly as regards Wales.                                     JOSEPH JONES.
SEYMOUR WIXLIAMS.  Whilst agreeing in  principle that it is desirable, to put an  end to subsidies  we  dissent from  the proposal  suddenly -to cut themoff now.  The class  of  person for  whom houses are provided  by the aid of subsidies, should be different from those catered  for by  privateenterprise.  The people who are now in real need of houses  are those who cannot afford to make any purchase of properties, and are unableto pay  any  but the lowest rent, and  this  is the class who  havenot  yet  been completely dealt with by  Housing Authorities,  andare  not  likely to be  dealt  with by private enterprise.  In our opinion the  sudden termination of subsidies would arrestthe  progress of building  houses to  let at low rents.  We  suggestthat to deal  with the  position, whilst the amount of the subsidies should be reduced to  meet existing financial conditions and build-ing  costs, for the next five years, subsidies should be provided onthe  basis of  a lump sum  per house, the actual figure to be  settled,and should vary in accordance with local conditions.  This wouldhave the effect  of  continuing the  provision  of houses for thoseunable to pay the rents which have to be charged for unsubsidisedhouses.  This would give full play for the energies of private enterpriseto deal with houses built for  sale or letting to those able to payan economic rent.  By adopting the lump sum payment in lieu of  the annuity system the   matter  could  be  reconsidered   each  year,  and  insteadof increasing the liabilities of the State at the  rate  of  three  orfour hundred thousand per annum, for a period  of 40 years, thewhole liability of the  Treasury  could be determined at the end  ofany year, if it were found that the need were  becoming satisfied.  The assumption  that  the average workman  can  pay a  rent  ot8s.  6d.  which with rates will amount  in many cases  to  12s. 6d.or  13s.  a week, is not  in  our  opinion  based on facts.  The  assumption  that  a  rent  of  7s. 9d.  could be paid in 1924even if  then correct does not  hold  now, as the decrease in wagesand increased  unemployment  have altered  the  situation,  as, after allowing for the decrease  in  cost of living the general  economic position of  those concerned is  definitely worse than in the year1924.                                      JOSEPH  JONES.                                      E. G. ROWLINSON.                                      PERCIVAL  BOWER.
   (5) Reservation  to Chapter  V, Paragraph  192 (c).  We dissent from the  recommendation  in view of the strenuousand dangerous duties involved in the service.  We consider 48 hours a week should be a maximum.                                     JOSEPH JONES.                                     E. G. ROWLINSON.     (6)  Reservation to  Chapter VI,  Paragraph 225.  We  dissent from  this recommendation  because  we  feel it  isanimated by a spirit of hopelessness and constitutes a grave charge against public administration, especially so as the new regime hasbeen in operation only for 2  years.  We are convinced that in thisshort time a situation has arisen which is not conducive  to smoothlocal administration,  but that nevertheless, the defaults have beenfew and almost negligible in comparison with the Authorities in fullcompliance.                                     JOSEPH JONES.                                     E. G. ROWLINSON.     (7)  Reservation to  Chapter VI,  Paragraph 226.  We  are  unable to associate- ourselves  with the expression  ofopinion at the end of this paragraph.  In our view this is a questionof high policy,  requiring much fuller consideration than the Com-mittee have given it.                                     EDWARD  J. HOLLAND.                                     PERCIVAL BOWER.                                     HARRY BOLTON.                                     E. G. ROWLINSON.  I agree with  the  above.  Moreover in my view such  a proposal would not lead to economy.                                     SEYMOUR WILLIAMS.  We dissent from the recommendation in this paragraph on theground that this is not  a matter upon which  the Committee was expected  to express any opinion, is outside  our terms of reference should not  be introduced into our report, and because we do notbelieve the time has yet  arrived when it would be wise or just to&quot; entirely remove restrictions.&quot;                                    PERCIVAL BOWER.                                    E. G.  BOWLINSON.
    (9) Reservation to Chapter VII,  Paragraph 235.  The salaries of teachers must, in. our opinion, be approached witha full consciousness and recognition of the existence of the  Stand-ing Joint  Committees on Teachers&apos; Salaries.  These  committees were established at the instance of a Minister of  State with  thefull knowledge and approval of the Government.   The findings ofthese Committees  have  from time to  time  been  the subject ofendorsement by the Cabinet.  The function of the Standing Joint  Committees has  been  to findby agreement  a peaceful and orderly  solution of  the salaries ques-tion, and  the  agreements reached since the establishment  of  theCommittee have in all cases been approved by the Treasury  and recognised for the  purposes of Government Grant.  We cannot therefore agree that we can with propriety, nor indeedwithout danger to the existence of the Standing Joint Committees,seek to impose upon teachers or upon Local Authorities departures from agreements or arbitrations already concluded  without referenceto the  Standing Joint Committees.  We dissent from the recommendation in sub-paragraph (vii) forthe following reasons. First, as regards National Health Insurancewe recall that the recipient has by statutory  contract contributedunder the National  Health Insurance Acts  towards  a provisionagainst sickness and disablement,  and therefore in our  opinion the adoption of the recommendation  would  constitute  a seriousbreach of  contract with  a person in a state  of  ill-health which,having regard to the  present attitude of the working  classes, wouldbe fraught with public danger.  Second, in relation to the FriendlyHocietj&apos; benefit,  we  likewise  think  that  the recommendation dis-courages thrift at a time when it is on the wane, and its adoptionwould tend to  undermine the great  Friendly Society movement  ini his country.                                     JOSEPH JONES.                                     E. G.  KoWLINSON.                                    &apos; PERCIVAL  BOWER.  I agree  with the above so far as  it relates to  Friendly Society-benefit.  I also disagree from the recommendation in the last partof sub-paragraph (ii).                                     SEYMOUR  WILLIAMS.
  We submit  therefore that  before any  conclusion is  reached orany recommendation made by this Committee on  the question of teachers&apos; salaries,  all our proposals should be tentative and thatthey should be submitted  to the  Standing Joint  Committee forimmediate consideration in order that if possible agreement may bereached.                                     JOSEPH JONES.                                     B. G. ROWLINSON.   (10)  Reservation to  Chapter VII,  Paragraph 237.  We are of the opinion that the field for economy to produce thesum  of five million pounds on  the  figures of 1931 should includeadministrative charges and cannot  reasonably be  expected  to beproduced from wages and salaries alone.                                     E. G. ROWLINSON.                                     JOSEPH JONES.                                     PEECIVAL BO WEE.

We dissent from the recommendation in the second part of thisparagraph on the following grounds :       (1)  The elimination of Professional Auditors is not in  the    interests of Local Government generally, nor in the interests    of economy and efficiency.      (2)  Inasmuch as only a small proportion of the Accounts of    Municipal Corporations is  audited by the District Auditors,    we  are of the opinion  that,  except in those cases where certain    Accounts relating to Government  Grants are already audited    by  District Auditors,  all Accounts of Municipal Corporations    should, be audited by  Chartered or Incorporated Accountants.                                   &quot;  PERCIVAL BOWER.
