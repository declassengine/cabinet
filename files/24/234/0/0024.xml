THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1932.SECRET.                                                  Copy No.  33CP.  374 (32).CABINET.PALESTINE:  LEGISLATIVE  COUNCIL.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    THE High Commissioner has discussed fully with the Prime Minister and&apos;myself the line which he should take at the Mandates Commission at  Geneva, andsubsequently  in  Palestine, with  regard  to  the  establishment of a LegislativeCouncil.    The  Cabinet will remember that this matter was fully considered earlier inthe year,  and that we then decided on the following line of policy :      (1) The  pledge of  His Majesty&apos;s Government that a Legislative  Council.           should be established must stand.    (2) That we should avoid, if possible, both here and in Palestine, any definite-           statement on the subject until the Mandates Commission met.    (3) That in the meantime the High Commissioner should try to secure the-           co-operation of Jews and Arabs  on various advisory boards, such as           the Agricultural Council,  and to  appoint some Palestinian members           to the Advisory Council during 1932.    (4) That the High Commissioner should proceed with the necessary measures;           for the reorganisation of  the Local Authorities, and that elections to-           these reorganised bodies should be carried out.    This course has been followed, except that it has not yet been found possibleto appoint unofficials to the Advisory Council.  Both Sir Ai&apos;thur Wauchope andI have succeeded in avoiding any formal pronouncement about the LegislativeCouncil.   The Mandates  Commission, however,  considers the Palestine Reporton the 10th November, and Sir Arthur will be bound tcmake there a full statementof policy.  Unofficial members (both Arabs and Jews)  have been appointed bythe High  Commissioner  to the  Agricultural Council,  the  Labour Board, theStanding Committee  on Commerce and  Industry, the Railway Board  and theRoad Board.  The High  Commissioner is proceeding with the reconstitution ofthe Local Authorities.  The necessary legislation will proceed in  the ordinary course, and it is expected that the elections will take place in the Spring.    Until  recently the situation in Palestine  was satisfactory.  Sir arthur wauchope gained the increasing confidence of both parties, and, as I have said,.secured  their co-operation on the advisory boards.   In the  last  few weeks,.however, an  unfortunate  set-back has taken place.  The Arab extremists have gained the upper hand in Arab counsels, and forced all members  of the Arabexecutive to withdraw from the Boards.   Sir Arthur  Wanchope, of  whose-judgment and handling of the whole position I have formed the highest opinion,,says  that the Arab situation is becoming so difficult, and  that  the Arabs are-becoming so suspicious, that it is necessary to reaffirm in Palestine our intentions of proceeding with the establishment of the Legislative  Council.   Unless this.were  done, Sir Arthur considers that  the extremists would obtain completeascendency, and that Arab co-operation  would become increasingly  difficult and ultimately impossible.  Moreover,  in view  of  the meeting  of  the Mandates.       [7801]
Commission and the definite pledge about the Legislative Council reaffirmed therelast year, it would, in any case, be necessary to make a definite statement to theCommission when it meets.    We are all agreed  that both  at the League  and in  Palestine the wise andhonest course  is to state the position plainly.   In substance, the High Commis--sioner would say that the pledges of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard  tothe Legislative Council  stand, and that they have every intention of establishingsuch  a Council.   The successful  initiation  and  working  of  any LegislativeAssembly  must  depend  largely  on  co-operation   and  goodwill.   The  HighCommissioner has, therefore, with the full approval of His Majesty &quot;s Government,proceeded in the first place by inviting co-operation on the advisory boards, whereArabs and Jews can have the opportunity of working together with governmenton  matters of common  interest.   The Local Authorities are being  reorganisedand their  powers extended.   This development in the local government is a natural precursor of the establishment of a Legislative Council, and the necessary measures for the reorganisation of the Local Authorities will be passed and theelections will  take place in the Spring.  Thereafter, the High Commissioner,  inconsultation with His  Majesty&apos;s  Government, will  prepare proposals  for theconstitution of the Legislative Council, and  will  discuss  those  proposals  withJewish and Arab leaders  in Palestine.    I understand that the Jews would much prefer that the  statement about theLegislative Council at the League  should be made in answer to a  question ratherthan  in the High Commissioners opening speech.  Sir Arthur Wauchope  isperfectly clear, and, indeed, it is obvious, that such a statement must be made, butthe question is whether he should make his pronouncement on  the  LegislativeCouncil in his opening speech or in the course of a discussion thereon.  There are-arguments both ways.  On the face of it it would  appear strange that a matter ofsuch  importance should not be dealt with  by Sir Arthur Wauchope in opening,and,  indeed, this might give rise to criticism and  suspicion, and I  think it isdesirable that perhaps in Palestine more than anywhere else we  should be quite clear and open in our policy.  If, however, Sir Arthur  Wauchope feels that  totake  the thing by stages would secure Jewish co-operation, and that this is aparamount consideration, I am content to  leave the matter to his discretion.     The Prime Minister  and I discussed  at length with Sir Arthur Wauchopewhat the developments were likely  to be in the future.  It is extremely improbable that  either side  will  agree as  to the form the Legislative Council should  take.The Arabs have always maintained that they must have a clear majority and,  infact,  govern the country.  The Jews have lately raised a claim to parity.  We aresatisfied that  neither  of these is possible.   The Arabs, of course,  cannot be given power to defeat the Mandate;  and the Jews, who are only  about one-fifth of thepopulation, could not be given equal representation in membership.   We shouldnot, of course, at this stage disclose any details of our proposals,  nor are we in aposition to do so; but it will be necessary for Sir Arthur Wauchope to make it plain to the Arabs, first, that His Majesty&apos;s Government stand by their pledge toestablish a Legislative Council, and, secondly, that they  stand equally  by the;terms of the Mandate and their determination to see that the Mandate will  beifully carried  out.  At  the same time he will make it plain to  the Jews that a claim to parity in the sense of equal membership in the first instance is a claim which could not be justified on any grounds, and  that they would be most unwise to  press a claim, which could  not be defended, which is not necessary for their protection and which  would alienate much of  the  sympathy they  now  enjoy.His Majesty&apos;s Government will see that they have full and adequate representa-tion on any Council.  Any Council must contain  a  large official element, and theexistence of that element (together with the overriding powers which the High Commissioner must have) will ensure that the terms of the Mandate are fully^observed.  He might, moreover, explain to the Jews that the initial constitution-of  the Council is not final, and that changing circumstances, e.g., in the ratio of population, would be a ground for altering the proportions of membership.     The real safeguard for the Jews, and the one on which  they will be wise to rely, is that His Majesty&apos;s Government is determined to carry out the Mandate, and  that  any measure they propose  will affirm that intention and ensure  its fulfilment.     It is  early  days to  look  further ahead, but  Ave are bound to  envisage a situation  in  which  one  or both  parties  might decline  to co-operate  in the
(establishment and election of a Legislative Council.  If both parties refused and rejected our proposals, we may find ourselves in a position in which we have doneour best  to  fulfil our pledge,  but in which fulfilment is  practically  impossible.That may discharge us for the time being from our obligation and throw us backon continuing to govern the country as at present.   But I  think  one thing isclear we must not  allow one party alone to prevent indefinitely the establishmentof a Legislative Council by a refusal to co-operate.    I have tried to  give my colleagues as clear an appreciation of the situation asis possible at the present time, and I am convinced that the line we  have decidedto adopt  is the right line and, indeed, the only one on which we could stand.    I would only add that we are very fortunate to have on the spot a man of.great character and wisdom, who may be safely trusted to steer his  ship throughmany shoals.
