                       FIRST  REPORT.                        INTRODUCTORY.    WE assume that the objective of the forthcoming World Economic and Financial Conference  is to facilitate a recovery from the present international  financial  crisis and  economic depression  and to secure an increase in  the  international interchange of commodities and services on a basis which  promises stability and  permanence.  We. shall consider the possible methods for attaining this objective under four broad heads :         (i) commercial policy,        (ii) producers&apos;  agreements,       (iii) debts and loans,       (iv) monetary and  credit policy. Before proceeding,  however, to a  separate discussion of these classes of question, there are certain general considerations which we  think it important to  emphasise.    2.   The questions  which  will come before the conference have been envisaged from the beginning as falling into two parts, financial questions on  the one hand, and  economic questions on  the other. The resolution of the Lausanne Conference itself  contemplated that the preparatory  committee of experts would  divide itself into two sub-committees  who  would only  meet together in joint  session  at their  discretion  when necessary for the co-ordination of their work. We  think  it  important  that this  division,  which   is   obviously convenient and  desirable from many standpoints, should not lead  to an obscuring of the essential interconnection between the two classes of question.  .8.   In the last  analysis it is only by means of goods and services that  financial  payments  can be made.    There  is,   therefore,  a fundamental connection between the scale of international payments which the world&apos;s  financial system  can succeed  in discharging, and the volume of  international  trade which  the commercial systems of the  world  render possible.  One  of  the  outstanding   causes  of the present international  crisis is that a due relationship between these two factors  was not maintained  in  the years  immediately preceding the  depression.   International  financial obligations wereincurred  upon a scale greatly exceeding  anything known before, while, on the other hand, the volume of international trade remained comparatively  stagnant and  was subjected  to growing   obstacles. There was no general recognition that there  was anything unsound or precarious in this  state  of things.  Small regard was paid in theflotation of international loans in the pre-slump years to the questionof whether  the  borrowing country was likely to achieve  an export surplus adequate to provide the means for the service of  the loans. Still  less  has  commercial policy  been  influenced  by  financial considerations.  No creditor country has determined its fiscal policy, whether that  policy  has  in fact  been of a  free  trade or a high- tariff  character, with reference to the desirability  of facilitating thepayment of international  debts.   On the contrary,  some  countries with  large  and  rapidly growing   financial  claims on the  outside world have  been especially active  in  raising tariffs with  the objectof restricting  imports,  while seeking  at the  same time to promote the development  of their export trade. It is,  in short, a  large partof the story of our present troubles  that the world in  recent years has dealt  with economic questions and financial questions  in water-tight  compartments.   4.  We  should  regard  it,  therefore,  as  profoundly unfortunate if the  division of  the  two subjects at the forthcoming Conference were  to  assume  a  similarly  watertight character.  To assert  the essential interconnection between  the two  should,  in our judgment,he a constant concern of  British  policy.   This consideration shouldbe borne in  mind in the preparatoiy work including the documenta-
tion  for the conference, and should form the basis for any generalresolutions or declarations of principle at the conference  itself.   5.  It is important,  moreover,  to  appreciate  the relationship between  economic  questions  and  financial  questions,  in order  toappraise  the possibilities of  constructive international action  thatare open in either  sphere.  The occurrence  of the  world  depressionis largely attributable, as we have said, to a conjuncture of incautiousand expanded international lending (superimposed on a large body ofexisting monetary obligations, political and commercial), and restrictedinternational trade : and it is unnecessary to discuss with which of thesetendencies,  taken  by itself,  the major responsibility  rests.   Duringthe past fifteen months, however, the  dominating  feature in  theworld situation has been an acute international financial crisis; andthe  additional  obstacles  which  have been   placed  in the way  ofinternational  trade  during  this  period  are  the  natural,  if  notinevitable, outcome of  this financial crisis.    The  exchange restric-tions,  the import  prohibitions,  and the  tariff surtaxes, which havebeen imposed with such profusion in the past year, and which have resulted in  a disastrous curtailment  of  the  volume of international trade,  have  sprung for  the most part from entirely  different motivesfrom those to which traditional protectionist  policies are attributable.The weaker  financial countries have been driven to  curtail imports by every means open to them in order to conserve as large a portionas possible of the foreign exchange which their exports bring themfor the purpose of discharging external  financial  claims.  Indeed,it is not only debtor countries to whom a favourable balance of trade has  come to seem essential as an assurance of financial solvency.Under the prevailing financial conditions  there may at any momentcome a large-scale withdrawal of  foreign balances  from any centre;and the protection against  the consequential danger of exchange depreciation  which  a favourable  trade  balance affords is one  withwhich  few countries  feel strong enough  to dispense.    6.  It is true  that  in  some  countries the  additional measures that have been taken in recent  months to restrict imports have beentaken  largely in  the interests  of  home industries;  but even here the  object has been the defensive one of assuring some degree of stability to  home  manufacturers  at  a time  of rapidly falling  world prices, and is thus essentially the outcome of the  present financialposition.  In so far as  tariffs have been increased in  order to supplyan  additional  revenue to  balance  budgets,  this  again must  beregarded as  a reaction  to the situation in the financial sphere.    7,   Thus, generally speaking,  the increased impediments to inter-national trade which have  been erected in recent  months representa phenomenon  essentially distinct from the tariff  barriers  which existed before the slump began.  Unlike the latter, the former haveno deep roots in  traditional national  policies, inspired by objectives of  national  self-sufficiency  and  supported  by  powerful  vested interests.   They   are  emergency  expedients which most of  thecountries concerned would gladly see swrept away when the emergencyhas passed.  We  expect, therefore, that there would be  no difficulty in  securing general acceptance  at  the forthcoming conference of strongly-worded   resolutions  calling   for  the  abolition of  these abnormal trade impediments as soon as  circumstances permit.   On the other hand,  it  is in our  judgment idle to expect  that  many countries will  be  willing,  in practice, to relax these impediments in  any appreciable degree,  so long as the financial conditions  which have given rise to them remain.   It will be little  to the purpose to demonstrate  that the  impediments  have   greatly  aggravated the international difficulties from which all countries alike are suffering. A country with a  desperate exchange and financial  position can no more  afford to defer to such considerations  of the  general welfare than a business man subject to an immediate threat of bankruptcy. An improvement  of the international financial situation is  thus an essential condition of  any  effective  agreement for  the  removal of even  the abnormal  impediments to international  trade  which have been imposed during the present depression.     8.  Thus, unless it is possible to find a solution for the problems in the financial sphere, it is unlikely that it  will be possible to make
any  real progress in the other.   On  the  other  hand, no  policy ofinternational financial amelioration will rest on a sound basis, unless it  is  accompanied&apos; by  measures  which  will  permit  first  there-establishment  of  the  now  shattered mechanism of international trade and subsequently  the progressive development of international trade under  freer conditions  than those which  existed in the  last decade.   9.  With these introductory  remarks, we  turn to consider  themain questions  which will come before  the conference under  the headings we  have indicated.
                   I. COMMERCIAL  POLICY.                 (a) Temporary trade restrictions.    10.   It  will be  evident from the  foregoing considerations  thatthe  present  world  economic  situation  increases the  difficulties  ofsecuring international agreement in the realm of commercial policy.Countries  which  feel  it  necessary  to  maintain  abnormal  tradeimpediments can hardly be expected, under present conditions, to agreeto  reduce  their normal tariffs.    The  removal of  the  abnormalimpediments demands as a prior condition  an improvement in thefinancial situation; and it will not  be easy, therefore, to do more  atthe forthcoming conference than to  secure general resolutions urging the removal of these impediments at the earliest practicable moment and to attach suitable  conditions  as  to the  removal  of  the  mostobjectionable  of  them to any  scheme  of financial  or  monetaryreconstruction on which it is possible to reach agreement.                 (b)  Permanent commercial policy.    11.   Apart from  these considerations, the  opportunities in the sphere of commercial policy  may  be limited by  the  susceptibilitiesand commitments  of certain  of  the  leading participants  in theconference.    The  United States   administration has  made  it  acondition of  its participation that tariff rates,  as  distinct from tariff policy, shall  not be discussed.   The freedom of action of the BritishGovernment  may be limited,  to an extent which we do not attemptto  assess,  by commitments  entered  into  at  Ottawa.   It  should,however, be possible to  secure agreement  to  certain  principles  of tariff making, which though they will not affect the degree of protec-tion which each  nation feels  bound  to afford  to  its own industries,will in  some  part, at any rate, mitigate the consequent  injury  to international trade.                   (i) Review of tariff  schedules.    12.   There exists, for example, a number of tariffs which yieldneither revenue nor  protection, because, although they are so highthat they prevent importation, the industry protected is  so inefficientthat it cannot  produce the  article in question at a  price  whichconsumers are willing to pay.  An instance of such a tariff is afforded by  that  upon motor cars in Hungary.   This  is sufficiently high  to exclude foreign cars,  but has failed  to call any  serious  home industryinto existence.  As a result  Hungary  is very  much worse equipped with cars than is Europe as a  whole, and a potential market is lost  tothe world.   The conference might be induced to express disapprovalof tariffs of this kind, and to recommend that nations should carefullyconsider their existing tariff schedules with a view to  removing suchanomalies.  It might even be  possible to  secure a general eondemna-tion of the principle of the so-called scientific tariff of which the casequoted is but an extreme example.  According to this principle the rateof protection  is so regulated that   the cost of an  imported articleis no less than that  of the equivalent  home-produced article.   As aresult the highest rates of duty are  reserved for the products of  those industries  which   are  particularly  unsuitable  to  each   country&apos;economy.  It  would  be  of   advantage  to world trade if it  wererecognised  that  no industry which  had not a reasonable expectation of supplying a substantial part  of the home market should be givenprotection.                           (ii) Quotas.    13.   So far  as  it can do so consistently with the  Ottawa agree-ments,  the British  Government might  advantageously attack thesystem  of quotas.  The last  year has  seen a considerable  extensionof the quantitative  limitation  of imports.  In part this has  been dueto  the  development  of the depression  itself.   For where there  isa large surplus production of any commodity which must be disposedof,  no rate of duty  which can be   seriously imposed  will  suffice  toprotect  the home producer from a disastrous fall in prices.  A policyof  rationing imports is alone effective.  But  in part  the develop-
menfc of quotas has been assisted by a desire to evade the implications of the  most-favoured-nation  clause  embodied  in  the  majority  ofcommercial  treaties.   An example  of the use  of  quotas for thispurpose is afforded  by the  German-Swedish commercial treaty  of1980, under which a quota of 5,000 Swedish cattle  is allowed into germany  at a  reduced rate of duty.  This  quota,  in  fact,  covers the whole Swedish trade,  and is manifestly unfair to  Denmark,  fromwhich  four times  this quantity is  normally imported.  The  spread of quotas  will  substantially increase the rigidity  of the international economic  structure.   Under  the  normal protection  afforded  bytariffs  there is  a  limit to  the  extent  to  which prices in different countries  may diverge, and, given time,  it is possible for countriesso to adjust their costs of  production that an equilibrium of inter-national receipts and payments is  maintained.   But  so soon as  an appreciable part of a country&apos;s trade is regulated  quantitatively, suchreadjustments become  impossible, and the  normal  mechanism  ofinternational payments must inevitably break  down.   The  growth of quantitative  restrictions upon trade is therefore an  extremelydangerous development.  We realise that the meat quota arrangement which  we have  entered into at Ottawa must  make it more difficult for us to  take a strong line in  opposition to  quota schemes.  This,however,  is the only  instance of quantitative limitation of imports which  we ourselves have  undertaken to impose;  for the so-called&quot;wheat quota&quot; already  established imposes  no such  limitation.The above  commitment  should  not,  however,  preclude us  fromurging the conference to take steps to limit the growth of the system and  to  secure its abolition  when more normal world conditions arerestored.   (iii) Regional tariff agreements and the most-favoured-nation                             clause.   14.  There is, moreover,  one important issue of tariff policy  onwhich  it may be essential for the  British Government  to define  its attitude at  the  conference.   There  is a  strongly-marked tendency in the world to-day towards regional tariff agreements.  The policyof inter-imperial preference  is essentially a manifestation  of this tendency.   It  is in  Europe, however, that  the tendency&apos;  is  mostmarked.  Repeated attempts have  been  made  in recent years tosecure agreements for mutual tariff reductions between neighbouring-European states.  The latest of these  attempts  is the recent agree-ment between Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg.    15.  It is of the essence of these regional agreements that theyinvolve discrimination between  imports  from  countries  which  areparties to an agreement  and imports  from other countries.   Theyare  thus in  conflict with the  principle of most-favoured-nation treatment, embodied  in  the majority of commercial treaties,  andthis is the  chief  obstacle  which has hitherto  stood in their way.The most-favoured-nation clause  has been in the past a cherishedobject of  British commercial policy,  and British Governments have accordingly taken their stand upon  this clause and have declined tofacilitate  regional tariff arrangements by  agreeing to its  infraction.It has, indeed,  been at times suggested by the promoters  of regionalarrangements that the parties  to them might be walling to extendany tariff reductions which  they agreed  to make  for the benefitof one another to other countries  which  imposed  only  low tariffsagainst their goods.  But, although it might thus have been  possiblefor  Great  Britain  to  secure   under  a  regional  agreement  thecontinuance  of most-favoured-nation  privileges   for  herself,  solong as  her  fiscal  policy  remained of  a free trade  or low-tariffcharacter, British Governments have none the  less  been unwilling to  accept the  modification of the  most-favoured-nation rule thatwould be entailed.    16.  Despite this discouraging attitude on the part of  the BritishGovernment,  the  movement  towards regional tariff  agreements haspersisted,  as  the   recent   Dutch-Belgo-Luxemburg   agreementtestifies.  Meanwhile, the situation has been materially changed bythe  alteration of fiscal policy in Great Britain  and  by the prospectof  a large  extension  of  the system  of  inter-imperial preference-
On the one  hand, the higher level  of British tariffs  makes  it less likely that it would be possible under a regional agreement to securethe  benefits  of most-favoured-nation treatment for Great  britain in the manner indicated  above.   On the other  hand,  the extensionof imperial preference makes it less  likely that European  states will  continue for long to acquiesce in  the  current  interpretation  ofthe  most-favoured-nation clause.  The existing system  of  mutualpreference between  Great  Britain  and  the  Dominions  would,  ofcourse, be a violation of the most-favoured-nation clause if  thesecountries  were independent  sovereign  states.   Yet  to regard  them as other  than  independent  sovereign  states is little  more  than a legal formality,  so  far  as   commercial  policy is  concerned.    in continental eyes  it  has  long been  anomalous that Great  britain should object to neighbouring European  states  granting  each  other special  tariff concessions, unless they are  extended to  her,  when she  is herself  a  party to an essentially similar system  of  mutualtariff  concessions   within   her  own   commonwealth.    Hitherto,however,  there has been  no  active disposition  to demand  a rectifiea-tion  of this anomaly, partly because other countries  with overseas possesions, such as the United States and  France, are interested  in maintaining  the principle that  tariff preferences between countries under  the same  sovereignty are  not  inconsistent  with  the most-fa voured-nation rule, but largely  because  the  preferences hithertogranted  by  Great Britain  have been comparatively  unimportant,entailing  onh-  a trifling discrimination against European countries,while our general fiscal policy  has been of an  exceptionally  liberalcharacter.   A  radical change in this attitude of complaisance mustbe expected  if we now  combine a  substantial degree of domesticprotection with a comprehensive system of imperial preference.   17.  It is by  no means  clear  that it would be wise policy forGreat  Britain  to  resist  a modification of  the most-favoured-nation clause, even if  its  maintenance in its present form could be regardedas a practicable alternative.   It is true that a regional tariff agree-ment,  in the  benefits of which  we do  not  share, will place our industries at  a competitive disadvantage in the markets concerned,  ascompared with  those  of countries which are  parties to the agreement.On the other hand,  the method of  regional  multilateral concession isprobably the only method by which  a reduction of tariff  barriers  inthe world can be secured.  There is to-.day,  particularly in Europe, a growing  sense  of  the damage  which different countries  do to one another by the trade impediments which they impose; and there is a growing readiness, accordingly, subject to the exigencies of the present financial situation, to consider favourably  the idea of reducing  importduties in return for reciprocal concessions.   But there is little  support for the idea that a free trade  or a low-tariff system is to the advantageof the country  maintaining  it,  except as a  means of  securingfavourable treatment for its exports.    To  the average Europeancountry to-day, a reduction  of its  own tariffs  represents a sacrifice;a  reduction of the  tariffs of other countries  a benefit.   It  is now beginning to be recognised that the benefits which would  come froma  reciprocal  reduction on a  wide  scale  would  greatly  outweigh the sacrifices.  But, according to the prevailing view, there  would be a heavy balance of disadvantage if tariff concessions were made to every country, including those which themselves impose prohibitive duties,in return for concessions from a few countries only.   It thus seems unlikely that any  progress in the direction  of  tariff reduction can  bemade,  consistently with the maintenance of the most-favoured-nation clause  in its present form.   18.   The  establishment  of  freer conditions of  trade  betweenneighbouring European states, whose national markets are in manycases  inadequate  to  realise the  potential advantages  of modernmethods of production, is clearly, from the  world standpoint, a step in the direction of progress, likely to  make for an increase  in theaggregate economic  well-being.  It  would   be  doubtful wisdom  forGreat  Britain to obstruct such  a development, even if she could  besure of obstructing it effectively.  At a time when there was a move-ment towards lower tariffs throughout the world, the most-favoured-nation clause had the effect of spreading the benefits of  each tariffconcession negotiated by one, among  all the countries protected by  it.     [7514]                                                 o
&quot;Governments were therefore in a position to enter into treaties for long periods secure in the knowledge that they would not suffer through the subsequent  grant by  one  party  of more generous terms to somecompeting nation.  It was in consequence a great aid to negotiation.But when, as is now the case, governments  are extremely  anxious toretain their  freedom to protect home  producers against sudden  andviolent price  falls, the insistence on this clause is likely to restrain them from entering  into agreements over conventional duties designed toremain in force for any length of time.    19.  For  the  reasons  given  in  the  preceding  paragraphs,moreover, we think it unlikely that it will prove practicable to secure for very long the maintenance of the most-favoured-nation clause inits present form.  The clause  is already moribund, and is unlikely to survive unless we are willing to agree to  its being reinterpreted ina manner adapted to the needs and conditions of the present day.    20.  We  realise that the modification of the present most-favoured-nation clause is likely to encounter vigorous  opposition,  but we areunanimously and strongly of the opinion that the British Governmentwould be well advised to make a virtue  of necessity  in  good time,and to indicate its readiness to consider the redefinition of the most-favoured-nation  clause.  The main principles which  should governthis redefinition are clear.  The object should be to prevent bilateraltariff agreements from assuming an exclusive character, by ensuring the benefits of most-favoured-nation treatment  to any country willingto  adhere to the provisions of the  agreement, or pursuing  a tariff policy not less liberal than that of the  parties to it.   Special safe-iguards might be necessary, however, to protect the position of GreatBritain,  in  view of  the complications arising from the  system ofimperial  preference.   It  should  be clearly  laid down  that  nopreferences that  we  may7 grant  within the commonwealth shoulddebar us from  most-favoured-nation treatment as reinterpreted on theabove lines if our tariff policy in other respects were such as to entitleus to it.    21.  In  making  this  recommendation,  we recognise  that it  isprobable that  Great Britain would  be ineligible for most-favoured-nation treatment, if redefined on the above  lines, without a modifiea-tion of her  present domestic  tariffs.   It  would none the  less be an advantage to  keep  open  the  possibility  of securing most-favoured-nation treatment by  making  the requisite  tariff reductions,  for ourpresent tariff policy is essentially7 experimental. We believe that thepractical alternative to a reinterpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause will be  first an increasing  evasion  of  it,  and  ultimately its general abrogation.  There would then be a real danger of a chaoticperiod of  complicated  discriminatory  tariff  systems,   and  tariffretaliations,  highly detrimental to  international  trade as a whole,and particularly detrimental to the interests of Great Britain.                        (o) Shipping policy.    22.   There  is  one  other  question  under  the  heading  ofcommercial  policy to which  we  desire to  call attention.   shipping has also suffered from the disturbing influence of economic nationalismin the post-war period.   Various countries have set  out under theinfluence of political  motives to foster  mercantile marines of theirown,  either  subsidising them at the taxpayers expense or supportingthem by differentiating against cargoes carried on  ships under otherflags.  There has been a huge increase in the total gross  tonnage  inthe world,  from 44  million tons in 1914 to  70 million  tons at thepresent time,   an  increase  far in  excess of  anything  that can bejustified  by  the volume of overseas trade, which is at  present belowits normal level on account of exchange difficulties, tariff increases athome and  abroad,  prohibitions and other trade restrictions.   TheTesult is  a condition of exceptionally severe depression in the shipping industry, from which it is not easy to discern any early prospect of relief.    28.   Shipping is  a particularly7 important British  interest, andit  would .be  appropriate  therefore that  British  policy  should bedirected  at the forthcoming conference to securing the abandonment
of  shipping  subsidies  and  the  suppression  of  all  acts  of  flagdiscrimination.  Inasmuch as shipping supplies a service instead of aphysical commodity,  the  problem differs in important respects fromthat  of trade  impediments in  general.   No country  maintainsdifferential  regulations  against foreign shipping  as  a  means  of ensuring exchange stability  or financial solvency.   Moreover,  the artificial expedients  employed  to  foster mercantile  marines  are  a source of expense rather than of revenue to national budgets.   Thereis nothing in the  policy  of  Great  Britain  in relation to shipping to preclude her  from taking  the  lead  in  urging the  modification of present practices.   On the  contrary, although  our  shipping suffersseverely from  the  subsidies  and  restrictive  measures  of  othercountries, we ourselves extend  complete equality of treatment  to theships of other countries, though  it is perhaps doubtful whether wecan suffer so anomalous a contrast to continue to persist indefinitely.It is true that a strong lead  in the direction indicated would be liableto bring Great  Britain into  direct  conflict with the United  States,who maintains  some of  the more objectionable of  the  restrictions to which reference has been made  above.  We do not presume to judge  how  much  weight should be paid  to  this consideration asa restraining influence.   It may be remarked that the present policyof contracting for postal services  at rates  far in  excess of thosejustified by the payments made  for equivalent services upon the basisof poundage has  recently excited criticism in  the  American  press.Subject to the foregoing,  we are of opinion that Great Britain should press  the question  of  shipping forward,  taking  her stand  on  theprinciple of equality  of treatment  for all ships under all flags in allports and in all trades.  -I 7514J
               II.-PRODUCERS&apos;  AGREEMENTS.   24.  At the World Economic Conference of  1927  the discussionproceeded under two main heads:  (1) the reduction of tariff barriers,and  (2) the  encouragement  of international  arrangements  betweenproducers in particular industries for the  allocation of markets, the regulation  of  production  and  the  like.   The  French  and othercontinental  representatives  were foremost  in  pressing  the latter question forward;  and  as producers&apos;  agreements  are specified inthe Lausanne resolution as a sub-heading of the subject matter of theforthcoming  conference,  it is  to be expected that  the  conference will  be urged by  continental  countries to give the  idea  of such agreements its support.   At  the  time  of  the 1927 conference, theBritish representatives gave  the idea of producers&apos;  agreements onlya very lukewarm support, largely because  it was felt that under theconditions   then   prevailing  the   British  industries  principally concerned,  i.c,  coal and iron and steel,  would  be  in  a  wealvbargaining position in any negotiations  that  might ensue.   In thisrespect the position has  now been  modified by  the changes in ourfiscal policy  and the greater degree of  organisation now prevailing in the heavy  industries.    25.  Inasmuch  as it  is only  the industrial  interests concernedwho  can  actually  negotiate  &quot;producers&apos; agreements,&quot;  the only question that is likely to arise for  the British Government is thegeneral attitude Which it should assume.  This might well be inconformity  with the recommendations  of the conference of  1927.Without making any recommendations on  the  question whether such agreements were desirable, the conference recognised the fact thatthey existed, and  would continue  to exist.   At the  same  time  itheld that  the field of  such  agreements wras  limited  to  &apos;&apos; branchesof production which are already centralised, and to products supplied in bulk or in recognised  grades.&quot;   Within this field  they might beexpected to &quot;secure a more methodical organisation  of production,and a reduction in costs  by  means  of a better utilisation of  existingequipment, the development on more suitable  lines   of new plant,and a more rational grouping of undertakings,&quot; and, on the otherhand, to &quot; act as a check on  uneconomic competition and reduce the-evils  resulting  from  fluctuations   in  industrial  activity.&quot;   Theconference, however, recognised certain dangers in such agreementsif they should &quot; encourage monopolistic tendencies and  the  applica-tion  of unsound business methods.&quot;   In consequence,  the reportcontinues, &apos;&apos; it appears to the conference that it  is entirely necessarythat agreements should not lead to an artificial  rise in prices, whichwould injure consumers,  and that they should give due considerationto  the  interests  of the workers.   It is  further  necessary  that  theyshould not,  either  in intention or effect,  restrict the  supply to anyparticular  country of raw materials or basic  products,  or  withoutjust cause create unequal conditions between the finishing industries of the consuming and producing countries or other countries situated in  the same conditions.   Nor must they7 have  for their object  oreffect any7  reduction in  the  economic  equipment  which any7 nationconsiders  indispensable,   nor  should  they  stereotype  the  presentposition of production, whether from the point of view of technicalprogress  or  of  the  distribution  of industries  among  the various countries in accordance  with the necessities imposed  upon  each by its economic  development and  the growth of  its population.&quot;     26.  The practical difficulties  in the  way of  the  negotiation of international  producers&apos; agreements,  particularly   under  rapidly changing  economic  conditions, are  very7 great.  We  are  not  ofopinion, therefore, that this expedient, in  general, has any promisingcontribution to offer to the  solution of  the present world difficulties. On the other hand,  we  see no good reason why the British Govern - ment should  seek  to discourage  any movement in  this direction, provided  that  the safeguards  contained  in  the resolutions of the World Economic Conference are observed.  In any  industrial field in which a producers&apos; agreement can be reached and  made effective, it  will tend  to introduce a  measure of stability, which in existing circumstances would be  clearly beneficial.
                   III.-DEBTS  AND LOANS.   27.  Separations  and war  debts  are excluded  from the scope ofthe forthcoming conference;  but  it may be taken as  certain that alarge number of debtor countries will plead their inability to meet their existing obligations in respect of commercial debts at the present level of prices, and  will urge that the writing down of these obligations to substantially  lower  figures is an  essential condition of  worldrecovery.  Many of them may also be expected to ask for fresh financialassistance in the form of new  international loans  in order to restore confidence  in  their currency and exchange systems  in the  present emergency and  to  provide  them  with  the  means  of  purchasing  the materials necessary to restart normal  economic life.   28.  In principle,  both  these requests will be in conformity withthe needs of the world  situation.  Next to the raising of the price level,  the scaling  down of  debt  obligations which are beyond  thefinancial capacity  of  the  debtor countries is the most  importantcondition of escape from the present international deadlock.  when this  has been accomplished,  a revival of international lending  willremain essential to restart  the wheels of  international trade.   29.  None the less, Great Britain must necessarily approach thesequestions  from the standpoint of  an  interested creditor country whowould  stand to lose if debt claims were to  be  written  clown by morethan is necessary,  and  of  an investing country  who will be  calledupon to provide  a substantial share of any fresh international loans.            (a) Consolidation of  short-term obligations.   80.  In regard  to  existing  debt obligations, an important feature of the  present difficulties is  the abnormally large  volume of externalshort-term indebtedness which certain  embarrassed countries  areliable to meet.   The inability of many countries to repay their  short-term debts  is  palpable  and has  been recognised by  the standstillagreements  which  they have  concluded with  their creditors.   Theeffect of these standstill agreements is that the  financial claims ofthe  creditors  are  frozen assets,  having little advantage from  the standpoint of liquidity over  a  long-term security,  while on the otherhand their continued  existence in a technically short-term form  hangslike  the sword of Damocles  over the economy of the debtor countries,and  obstructs the possibility of the. restoration of their credit.   Theappropriate  sequel,  therefore,  to  a  standstill   agreement  is  the conversion or partial  conversion of the short-term  obligations coveredby them into long-term obligations.   31.  In so far  as  the difficulty of creditors in  obtaining paymentof these  obligations   is due to the insolvency of their  individualdebtors, the question is  essentially one  for  the private interests concerned.  In  large part,  however, the  difficulty arises from  thepublic control  of  the exchanges  which prevents debtors who  areperfectly solvent in terms of  their own currencies from discharging their external obligations; and, in so far as this is so, a solution  willrequire the co-operation of the governments who  will  be represented at the conference.  The right  method of attacking the problem is to devise a scheme which will provide an automatic  distinction between those debts which are good, in the above sense of the term, and thosewhich must, temporarily, at any  rate, be  regarded as bad.   32.  Various schemes have been  suggested with this end in view.According to one,  the individual debtor would buy bonds from thecentral bank in the  country in which  the standstill  was operative.These bonds would be  accepted by  the creditor  in discharge  of  hisdebt.  The central  bank in  the creditor country would  agree to  accept these bonds as  collateral in the same waj&apos;  as  standstill bills are  now accepted.  The  rate of interest and redemption of these bonds  wouldbe a matter  of  negotiation, but would be such as to consolidate theposition of the  debtor country.  As  the individual debtors would be under the necessity of finding cash for the purchase  of these bonds,this method of repayment would only be open   to those who weresolvent.  In this way the present problem of short-term indebtednesswould be completely solved.   For  the  debts of  solvent borrowers
would be repaid, and the debts of insolvent borrowers would representno threat to the exchange.  We are of the opinion that  the conference should  endorse  the  principle  of  funding  short-term  obligationseither upon these  lines or upon any other which would prove equallysatisfactory.               (b) Writing down of long-term debts.   88.  The question of possible reductions in  the capital or interestof external debt  obligations  raises  more difficult issues.   Some ofthese obligations  are a heavy burden on  the economic life of debtorcountries, and at the present level of world prices are probably beyond their capacity- to pay.  Every  shade of degree, however, is represented in the  ability of debtor countries to meet the interest on their debts.Moreover,  the  ability to  pay of a particular country will  be greatlyaffected by the future course  of international trade and world prices.If the  international trading situation  were to continue to degenerateas it has  done in  recent  years, not many  external claims  would remain sound indefinitely.  On the other hand, if a revival of inter-national trade and a recovery of world prices could be  brought about,the  debt obligations which would  still  require  to  be permanentlywritten down would be comparatively few.   84.  In these  circumstances manifest dangers will attach to anyattempt to evolve  at the conference a general scheme for  the writingdown of debts.  The endorsement  of the principle that  oppressivedebt obligations should be reduced would be  used by comparativelystrong debtors  as a  lever to secure relief from burdens,  which notindeed  without difficulty  they are  at present able to  sustain  andwhich  they might be able to carry with ease, as soon as the world situation has improved.  Apart from our special interests as a creditorcountry, it is far from clear that a drastic and universal writing-down of debt claims would  promote the  cause of  world  recovery.   Forrecovery will require international lending on a considerable scale, andinvestors will not be easily induced to  adventure their money again inother countries, if  the principle is established that in time of difficulty,and  without sufficient cause, they must expect a substantial repudiationof their claims.   35.  The   British  Government  must,   therefore,  necessarily7approach  with  great caution any general scheme for the organisedreduction of the  international debt  claims of private individuals-In so  far as they are inevitable, defaults have already  taken place,or will take  place in the future.  No good purpose  would be served by  giving  some  form  of official sanction to  defaults which  mightnot  otherwise occur.   86.   On  the contrary, experience  suggests  that there is need for more effective  organisation in all lending countries of the world toprevent wilful  default by debtors who are still in a position to make substantial  payments,  or to  prevent  light-hearted  borrowing by countries  whose ability to meet  their obligations is  from the  startextremely  doubtful.  The main responsibility for the  satisfactory7performance of these functions must  alway7s lie with  the establishedissuing houses  in  the important financial centres.   As agents for the borrowing  governments they  are in  a position to  bring  pressure tobear upon any7 debtor who in their opinion is not making adequateefforts to fulfil his obligations; and the close association which exists between them is  sufficient,  except  in  the most abnormal circum-stances, to prevent an unsatisfactory borrower from playing off onelending centre against  another. But a useful  function might be fulfilled by  active  bodies  such as councils of foreign bondholdersrepresenting investment  trusts,  insurance companies,  and  similarbodies.   Such councils,  in  addition to  recording  and  publishingdefaults and other instances of the nonfulfilment of the  terms uponwhich  money  has  been  raised by foreign governments and&apos; public authorities, might extend their surveys to a general appraisement ofthe  international  investment position, and might help in this way  tosecure  that  the lending  policy of issuing houses should not be outof relation to the  broad facts of the international economic situation.Generally  we should like to see more active councils of foreign bond-holders established  and  greater  collaboration  between  those indifferent financial centres.
    87.   In the  meantime, we think that the position of the BritishGovernment should be that obligations which  a  debtor country maybe  unable  to meet at present but which there  is reason to believe it could  meet, if world trade and prices  were to recover, should bemaintained intact  as  far as  possible, relief of  a  purely  temporarycharacter  being  given,  where  necessary,  so long  as  the  present-emergency continues.    88.   The  temporary relief which it may be necessary to give insome cases raises a question  on which the conference might rendera  useful function.  If the  period  for which the  temporary relief is given is arbitrarily  defined  as a year or a  specified number ofyears, there  will be  a  danger  that  the  prospect  of  a subsequentreturn to the old rate of burden, whether trade has improved or  not,will prevent  the  restoration  of confidence  in the  debtor  country.It  would be  desirable, therefore,  that  the duration of the  periodof relief should  be defined in terms of the movement of commodity prices.  For the rise or fall of world prices affords the best availablecriterion of  an  improvement or deterioration  in  the capacity ofdebtor countries to make external  payments.    39.   The  principle of linking financial payments with the move-ment of prices was embodied in the Dawes Plan for the  settlementof German reparations,  later to be  swept away  to  the  disadvantage of the world  in  the Young Plan. It is a principle to which it maybe  increasingly  necessary to  have  recourse in future.  Indeed,  weare inclined to  suggest that  it might be  advantageously  applied in-connection  with  the issue  of new  international loans;  that  is to.say, that an integral part of  the terms of issue  of such loans mightbe  a variation of  interest-rates in  accordance  with  the  movementof world prices.  We  are clear that the principle would be of great assistance  in facilitating  the  temporary  abatement of existing debtobligations, without unduly prejudicing their  ultimate security.    40.   If this  principle is  to  be used,  it is clearly desirable  thatan authoritative index-number, measuring the  movement  of world prices should  be established.   This would  appear  to be an appropriatefunction for the Economic Section  of the  League  of Nations.  Wesuggest, therefore,  that  the forthcoming  conference  should invitethe League to establish and  maintain an authoritative index-numberof  world prices,  which might by agreement between borrowor andlender be  made  the basis for vaiwing the interest  receivable uponnew international loans in sympathy with  movements in the pricesof commodities.                       (c) Guaranteed loans.    41.   We  pass  to the question  of the provision of fresh loans.It may be  well to observe, in  the first instance, that  under the termsof the semi-official embargo in the London capital market, as recentlymodified, it  is impossible for the British public to take any part in new  issues the  proceeds of  which  are to be remitted outside theEmpire,  and even loans within  tho Empire,  if  the  security inquestion ranks as a trustee security, can only be made subject to theconsent  of the  Bank  of  England.   We  assume, however,  that thestringency of this embargo,  which  has  been imposed  for  purposesof  a  temporary  character, will  eventually be relaxed.    42.   There is clearly no likelihood that investors in any country would be willing to lend substantial sums to the countries which chieflyneed assistance  on the sole credit of the borrowing government.   Ifsuch loans are to be provided, they will have to be made possible by-the  guarantees  of  the  governments  of  the  lending   countries.In view of   the budgetary  difficulties  which  confront  all  creditor-countries  at  the  present  time, their Treasuries will  be naturallyreluctant  to  incur  the  liabilities   which such  guarantees  would entail, particularly as  the chance that the liabilities might  materialisemust necessarily be reckoned high  in the  light of the  uncertaintiesof  the  political  and economic  outlook.   It  is important  to observein  this  connection that,  whereas  it can  be argued  cogently  thatif loans were  granted on a large  scale to a large number of  countries,there would be  a high probability that the result would be to break
 through  the  vicious circle of the  world depression,  the  probability of such a sequel  would be small if the loans were confined to a few of the more desperately  embarrassed  countries,  or were  doled out with a sparing hand.   Thus  the policy of international guaranteed loans is  exposed to the  fundamental  dilemma that  if the  lending governments confine their  liabilities  to moderate  dimensions they will  very probably lose what they lend,  while in  order  to have  a reasonable assurance  of  turning  round the  world situation, they would have to lend  more than they can afford to risk.    43.   The difficulties of a policy of organised international lending are further increased by the tact that the principal creditor countries are primarily interested in different parts of the world. It might be ai-gued with  some force that  the restoration of Germany  holds the key  to world recovery,  that the  fresh financial assistance which the creditor  countries   are  prepared  to  give  should,   therefore,  be concentrated  irpon  her,  and  that,  if  it were  so concentrated, big results might be achieved by risking a  comparatively  moderate sum. But France, who is interested  both politically and  financially in other European countries, could not be expected to agree  that Germany should be the sole recipient of  international financial favours. In the eyes of the United States, the restoration of central and south America- is  no less important than that  of central Europe.   Great Britain will  feel  a  special obligation  to ensure  that  such  overseas loans as she is able to make should go  mainly to the  Dominions and to such countries as  are large purchasers of our goods.    44.  It is then difficult to suppose that agreement could be secured at the forthcoming  Conference for  any  plan of concerted guaranteed loans concentrated  on restoring  particular areas.   Nor, in  view of the divergent circumstances of the embarrassed countries,  is it likely to be easier to secure the adoption of a plan under  this heading which would be comprehensive in its scope.    45.  Formidable  as  are these difficulties, the need remains,  we believe, fundamental for supplying embarrassed countries  with fresh international  purchasing-power in  order  to restart  the processes of international  trade.  We  doubt,  however,  if this need can be  met by action within the narrowly financial sphere.   It is obvious that, in existing  conditions, the British  Government must necessarily display the utmost  caution before  agreeing to give  its  guarantee to fresh international loans.   We discuss  in the succeeding section of our report the possibility  of increasing  the aggregate  supply of the international means of payment in  such a way as  to enable advances to  be made  to  the embarrassed  countries without  depleting  the financial   resources  of  the creditor  countries.   Policies  of this character  bold,  we  believe,  the key  to  the problem of fresh inter- national assistance.                        (d) Interest rates.    46.  There is  one other matter relevant to international  lending to which  we desire to refer.  Financially strong countries can assist the  financially weak, not only directly by making loans  to them, but  indirectly by promoting  the establishment of  a  lower  rate of interest  for loans  generally.   From  this standpoint  the  British conversion scheme is an important contribution to  world recovery; and the stimulus of our example  has already led to  the introduction of similar conversion schemes in other countries.  In  this matter, in contrast to others, such as tariffs, the action which an  individual country takes to  improve its  own position is  helpful  rather than detrimental to the world as a  whole.    47.  One of the  underlying  causes  of  trouble in  the post-war decade has been  the maintenance of interest rates at  a level highei than  could be justified by the  earning-power&apos; of capital; and  the world&apos;s economy  will not  rest  on a really sound  foundation  until  a lower level has been established.   The  question of interest rates is, therefore,  one to  which  the  attention  of the  conference mightprofitably be directed, with a view to considering  what action mightbe  taken   in different  countries  to  facilitate  the establishment  of lower rates.
           IY. MONETARY  AND  CREDIT  POLICY.    -18.   It will be apparent that in regard to many of the matters wehave hitherto discussed, the British Government will  be compelled bycircumstances to assume  a predominantly defensive  attitude againstdemands made upon  it.   It is, therefore, the more desirable that inthe remaining sphere of monetary questions the British Governmentshould, if possible, assume a constructive role and take  the lead inmaking  far-reaching  proposals.    Unless  it has proposals of its  ownto make, there is a danger that in this sphere, too, a defensive attitudemay be forced upon it.  For we must expect that  the representativesof other countries will dilate upon the  injury that has been clone to financial confidence in the  world by  our  departure from the  goldstandard, and press Great Britain for an undertaking to restore hercurrency to a gold basis at the earliest possible moment.  In urgingthis course upon us. they will be able to point to the recommendationsof the  Gold Delegation of the Financial Committee of the League ofNations and to resolutions of the board of the Bank for international settlements.    11).   Upon this matter  the British Government  has, up to thepresent, maintained the position that it  must keep  its  hands  free,  thatit cannot contemplate a return to gold under such  unstable conditionsas now prevail, and that it is impossible  to foresee when the conditionswhich might permit a return to gold will  be established.  This is, inour judgment, a prudent  position and, subject to what  follows, weare of the opinion that there should be no departure from it, no matter what pressure may be brought to bear upon us by other countries.    5ii.   It would be a mistake to suppose that it is only so long as the abnormal conditions  of  the present  crisis  prevail that it  might be disadvantageous or dangerous to  return to gold.   The events of thepresent crisis will leave behind  them an  enduring impression whichmust add greatly to the difficulties of reconstituting the gold  standard.in the  forms  in which we have known it hitherto, as a  satisfactoryinternational monetary system.        (a)  The  difficulty  of reconstituting the gold standard.    51.   The  central  fact   which has  led  to, and  aggravated,  theinternational financial crisis of  the past  eighteen months  has  beenthe  increasing  tendency   to  move  short-term balances from  onefinancial centre to another in accordance with passing  fluctuationsof confidence.  The financial world in general has taken  to changingits international banker and has developed an increasing disposition to do so as time  has gone on.  The distrust which has prompted these movements  of balances,  as is  frequently the case with   financialdistrust, has created its own justification.  Foreign holders of depositsin London suffered heavy exchange losses as the result of our enforceddeparture from  the gold standard, an event  which has created amore powerful impression on the outside world than it  is  easy forus to appreciate.    52.   The  international  gold   standard  system,   as it has  been worked   in  the  last  decade,   has   depended  for  its   stabilityon  the  tacit assumption  that  balances  would  not be   abruptlywithdrawn   on  a  large  scale  from  one  centre  to another.  yet the  mere  fact  that  such  movements  have taken place  duringthe present  crisis, and  that a   centre  as  strong  as London  hasbeen unable  to resist the  strain;  must make it more  likely  in futurethat such movements will begin on far slighter provocation,  and  will develop momentum far more quickly.   In 1981, it took a long seriesof exceptional troubles and misadventures to drive sterling off gold an  over-high  gold parity,  years of difficult conditions for our basicexporting industries with  an unsatisfactory trade balance and over-advertised and misunderstood unemployment figures,  all creating theimpression  before the  slump began that  there was something unsoundin  the  position  of Great  Britain;   then  a  world  depression ofunprecedented  severity,  the  German  standstill agreement,   therevelations as to the finances  of the unemployment fund  and  thebudget generally and. finally,  a  naval mutiny.   Eight up, indeed,to  this  last  event,  the   greater  part  of  the  outside  world  didnot really believe  that the pound could  fall.   But  when once  this    [7514]                                                 D
 had happened, it was only a  few months  before quite a widespread.expectation grew up that the dollar would go too, although the dollar was  so  fortified by  gold  reserves as to be  manifestly  impregnableagainst a purely external  drain, though not, of course, invulnerable,if Americans themselves  were to lose confidence  in their currency.Now that it  has been demonstrated that the pound could fall,  thingscannot be again  for  many years  just what they  were before the pound  had  fallen.   The  strongest  currencies must  necessarily bemuch more liable to external runs and perhaps internal flights if any circumstances arise which appear to justify  misgivings.    58.  In  these circumstances any attempt to reconstitute the  goldstandard along traditional lines would be exposed to newT difficulties and hazards.  In the first place,  it is evident that the so-called gold-exchange standard system, i.e., the system by which the central banks of many countries hold part  of  their legal reserves in  the  form offoreign exchange assets, has  suffered a serious and perhaps  a fatalblow.  It was by the widespread  adoption of this  system that thegeneral return to gold after the currency disorganisation of the earlypost-war  years was  facilitated.  The  adoption  of this  system  was largely attributable to the recommendations of the Genoa Conferenceof 1922,  which it will  he desirable  at  this stage of the argumentto recall.    54.  The Genoa  Conference met at a time of  extreme monetaryinstability.    No  European country was  effectively on the  goldstandard:  every continental country which  had been a belligei-entin the war  was confronted with  a heavy budget  deficit,  and  wascontriving in greater or less degree  to make ends meet  by currencyinflation.  The currencies of  several countries were already  under-going, as a consequence, a process of rapid  deterioration both in their internal and  external values, while others were subject to an imminentthreat of the same fate.   The  vicious circle of inflation, in short, wasin full swing over a  large part of Europe, and there  prevailed as a consequence   chaotic  fluctuations  in the  foreign exchanges  whichprejudiced the trade of those countries whose currency systems were on a sound foundation.    55.   In.  these  circumstances  the   Genoa  Conference   in  itscurrency7 recommendations was primarily concerned with the measures necessary, to stop the rot that was going on  and to substitute order forchaos.   It pointed out that in the first instance each country mustgain control  of its own currency;  that for this purpose budgets mustbe properly balanced, and that  this could only be done by each country&quot;by  its  own  independent efforts&quot;  (Article 29).   It proceeded to advocate  a development of &quot; the  practice of  continuous  co-operationamong central banks,&quot;  and suggested .&apos;&quot; an early meeting of  repre-sentatives of central  banks&apos;&apos;  in order to facilitate  &apos;&apos; a permanentassociation or entente for the  co-operation of central banks,  notnecessarily confined to Europe &quot;  (Article 80).   It laid down as theultimate objective to be  aimed at that all European  countries shouldrestore their  currencies to  a gold basis, this being &quot; the only commonstandard &quot; which they &quot; could  at present agree to adopt &quot; (Articles 81and  82).   It  recognised  that  this  end  could  not  be  attainedimmediately, since budgets must first be balanced, and that it  wouldprobably be necessary for many countries to adopt a lower gold paritythan  that prevailing before the war  (Articles 83, 84 and 85).    Theconference   then  concluded   its   currency  recommendations  with-article 36 which we think it desirable to set out in full:        &apos;&apos; These steps might by themselves  suffice to  establish a gold    standard, but its successful  maintenance  would  be materially    promoted, not  only  by  the proposed  association  or entente of    central banks, but by  an international  convention to be adopted    at a suitable time.   The purpose of the convention  would be to    centralise and co-ordinate  the demand  for gold,  and so to avoid    those  wide fluctuations in  the purchasing power of  gold,  which    might otherwise result from  the simultaneous  and competitive    efforts of a number of countries to secure metallic reserves.  It is ... suggested that  the. convention  should  embody  some  means of  . economising the  use  of gold by maintaining reserves  in the ;form    of foreign balances,  such  for  example  as  the  gold  exchange    standard, or an international clearing system.&quot;
     56.  Four features of this article deserve  attention.   In the first  place,  it  recognised implicitly  that. it  was only  if  a reasonable  stability in the purchasing  power of gold could be  secured  that the  gold  standard  could be  successfully  maintained.   Secondly, the:  conference recognised, though in guarded language, the danger that  a general  return to the gold standard might entail a disadvantageous  fall in  gold prices as the result of &quot; the simultaneous  and competi-  tive efforts of a number  of countries to secure metallic reserves.&quot;  Thirdly, in order to minimise this danger, the conference thought  it  necessary  to  secure an  economy in the  use  of gold by persuading  central banks to  keep part of their legal reserves in  the  form of  foreign balances.   Fourthly, for  this purpose it advocated  a formal  international  convention.     57.   Though,  at  first,  a  brief  period of increasing monetary  confusion  succeeded  the  Genoa  Conference, the  majority of its  currency recommendations were successfully carried  out  in the years  that followed.   In one country after another  inflation was  checked,  budgets were  balanced, and the gold standard was restored, usually  on the  basis of a  lower parity.  As regards the recommendations of  article  86,  though  no international  convention has been  adopted  and no permanent  association established between central banks,  a  considerable   degree  of   informal   consultation  and   co-operation  between the principal central banks  has, in  fact,  developed.   The  method of  economising the use of gold by keeping legal reserves in  foreign  centres was  adopted, by means of express legislative amend-  ments, by  many countries on their return to a gold basis. This has, however, proved insufficient to avert the  danger  which  the Genoa Conference foresaw of an undue appreciation of the purchasing power of gold: and  under the  pressure of  the catastrophic  fall  of  gold prices in recent years the gold standard has again  broken  down a? an international system.    58.  While the  system of  keeping legal  reserves partly in  the form of foreign balances undoubtedly served for a time  to diminish pressure upon  the  available supply  of  monetary gold,  it added to the instability of the international financial position after the world depression  had begun.  The foreign balances that  were  held in this- way by central banks formed an important element in the mass of inter- national short-term money which was liable to be moved from centre to centre at any moment; and after trouble had arisen central banks, in a natural  endeavour to preserve  their assets, participated  last year in the withdrawal of  balances from financial centres  which had fallen under suspicion.  Thus,  regarded as an expedient for eking out an insufficient  supply  of gold, the gold-exchange  standard system has shown itself essentially unreliable a fair-weather device  which may work well enough so long  as nothing else goes wrong, but which is incapable of standing the  strain  of  a  period  of difficulty.   Even, therefore, if it were  practicable to  secure the extensive readoption of this system as part of an international policy for restoring the gold standard, we should regard it as unwise to rest the monetary structure of the world exclusively on  a basis  which has proved so precarious.    59.   In  any case, however, it  may be  doubted whether it would&apos; be.  practicable  to persuade central banks  again  to hold  their legal reserves  on  the same scale  as before in the form of  foreign exchange assets.  In  the last decade the view won a general acceptance  that a balance in a financial centre with the prestige of London was assafe an asset for all  practical purposes as gold in the bank&apos;s  ownvaults:   But this belief has  been belied by the event,  and everycentral bank must  be expected in future to be extremely reluctant to take a similar risk again.   (b)  The danger  of  any British undertaking to return to gold.    60.   Thus the expedient by means of which the Genoa conference had hoped  to  secure  the economy in the use of  gold  w-hich they considered necessary has been  tried,  has broken down,  and cannoteasily  be set up again.   Yet  the  need which  this  expedient  was designed to  meet remains  fundamental  if the gold  standard is to-function  again on  an international scale.   In indicating  the  need     [751-1]                                                n 2
   for measures to  economise the use of  gold, the Genoa Conference   doubtless had mainly in mind  the fact that world  gold prices were   at a  much  higher level  in  1922 than  in pre-war  days.   This fact   gave  rise to a natural presumption that the supply  of gold, which   was compatible with  the pre-war price-level, would  be inadequate to   sustain a growing volume of  transactions  at  the higher  post-war   price-level.   It is true that gold prices have since fallen  heavily    indeed, so far as the wholesale prices of primary commodities  are   concerned,  to  below  the  pre-war  level;  and  this should  make it   easier to sustain an active volume of trade on the basis of the amount   of gold  available  when  the  abnormal difficulties  of the  present   -emergency have been overcome. Rut the relief that may be afforded   in this way  to the pressure on the  world&apos;s  gold supply must  not be   exaggerated.   The  present low  level  of  the wholesale  prices  of   primary commodities  is out of  relation to the level of the  prices of   finished commodities and of the costs of production, and a substantial   recovery  in the  prices  of  wholesale commodities  is an  essential   condition of trade  recovery.  The gold level of wages and incomes   remains far higher than it was before the war, and it is this, rather   than  the wholesale price-level,  which serves  to determine the volume   of money required to sustain a condition of active trade.      61.  This, however, is only a comparatively minor factor in  the   problem.  The question of the possible inadequacy of the  supply of,   gold  has  been  complicated  in  recent years  by  the  increasing   unevenness  of its distribution.  The greater  part  of  the  world&apos;s   stocks of monetary7 gold is now concentrated in a few of the financially   stronger centres.  There can be no assurance or even likelihood that   this  state of things will  be  corrected when  more  normal conditions   of trade have been  restored.  We must expect rather, if the  inter-   national gold standard were to be restored, that large surplus gold   reserves in  certain countries would coexist  with scanty reserves in   others, giving rise to the constant  danger of an external  run upon   them.  This danger, moreover, would be  immeasurably  increased   by the distrust left behind by the present crisis, which would cause   an  external  run  to develop very quickly upon any  country  whose   position  was thought  to be unsound.      62.  The Gold Delegation  of  the Financial  Committee  of  the   League of Nations in their Final (Majority) Report,  issued in June   1982, declare their belief that &quot;  at the  present stage of  world economic   development, the  gold standard remains the best available monetary   mechanism,&quot; and urge  &quot; the  return,  within the  shortest  possible   time,  to the  international gold-standard  system&quot;   as of  &apos;,&apos; vital   importance to economic and financial development.&quot;  They recognise.   however, the  difficulties  of  the restoration of  the   gold  standard   arising not merely from the circumstances of the present emergency;   hut also from the breakdown of the gold-exchange  standard system.   After arguing that the gold position had been in some degree improved   by  the recent  return of gold  from non-monetary to monetary use,   the report proceeds as follows :           &quot; Were it  not  for other factors that have arisen, the threatened      shortage  of gold to which w7e drew attention in our first interim      report  might  have  been averted for some  years.  When  our      first  interim report was published two years ago,  a  considerable      number  of countries  were operating under the  gold-exchange      standard under which they were  legally entitled  to  keep a part      or the whole of their  reserves,  not in gold, but in liquid  assets      abroad.....Although this system was so widely and so largely      practised, it  had  in recent years caused certain  misgivings for      a  number of  reasons  into  which  we  need not enter  here,  but       more especially because it was felt that it involved on the creditor      bank a risk of exchange depreciation in the country where the assets      were invested.  This risk has proved to  be a real one,  and there       has,  as  a result,  been a rapid conversion of available assets  into      gold.   Unless, when  the gold standard is once  more  put  into      general and effective operation, some measures are adopted either      substantially  to  lessen this risk or to  devise a  new system in       place of the  post-war gold-exchange  standard,  the additional      demands for  gold arising from  the partial abandonment of  the       practice  of   maintaining reserves  in   foreign cui-currencies  may
    counter-balance   the  recent  abnormal   augmentation   in   the    available stocks  of monetary gold.&quot;   1 (13.  The majority of the  Gold Delegation make various sugges- tions designed to overcome this difficulty.  The3r indicate two possible ways in which countries might  organise  the  gold-exchange  standard so as to minimise the possibility of exchange losses.   &apos;      .  &quot; The first is that such countries will  choose carefully among    the  principal financial  centres  those which  offer  the  greatest    promise of future stability.  The other is that an endeavour should    be  made  to spread the  risks  of  losses  by utilisiug  such an    international institution as the Bank for International Settlements    as the agency through which  the  system shall  be administered.    In the latter case, the reserve assets.of the gold-exchange standard    country  would  be  deposited with  the international bank which    would  in turn spread its  deposits among its constituent central    hanks.&quot; They recognise, however, that &quot;it is probable that  the gold-exchange standard will  in future be  much  more restricted than  it was  in the  years before  1981.&quot;    They make  accordingly  proposals  for securing an  economy in the use of gold in other ways.  Their major proposal is  that the  minimum  reserve ratios of gold  which central banks are at present required to  maintain against  their note issues should be reduced.   Their minor proposals relate to the withdrawal of gold  currency from circulation, the replacement of notes of small. denominations  by subsidiary coin, and the  development of  the  use of cheques.    64.  While we  should welcome the  adoption  of  these various proposals, we regard  them as quite insufficient to afford a  reasonable presumption that a  restored gold standard  would  be free from  the dangers which have overwhelmed it in recent \rears.   The extent of the economy in the use of gold which would be effected by a reduction of legal reserve ratios would  depend largely, of course, on the  pro- portion by which the legal reserve ratios were reduced.  But in  view of the  unevenness of  the existing international distribution of gold, the assistance which would be rendered even by a substantial all-round reduction would be  much less than might at  first sight appear.  For its main effect would merely be  to increase to a still larger figure the free  gold  reserves  of those countries  which already possess  large surplus reserves: and, though this  might exert  an influence in  the direction of inducing these countries to pursue more liberal credit policies, it is  unlikely, in view of  the magnitude  of their  existing surplus reserves, that this influence would prove important.  So far as the  weaker financial countries are concerned,  a  reduction of their legal reserve ratios would do nothing to replenish their scanty stocks of gold.  By freeing a larger proportion of these stocks for export, it would, indeed, enable them to return to  an effective gold basis  with smaller gold  holdings than  would  be  necessary  without  such a reduction. But, if they did so, they would be in a weaker position than ever  for resisting an external drain, since gold which  is ordinarily immobilised  against  the note-issue can be made available for export in the last  resort  by special measures.   Regarded,  indeed, as an expedient  for  facilitating a return to gold by countries whose  gold reserves would otherwise be insufficient for the purpose, a reduction of legal reserve ratios by itself is exposed to much the same objection that has revealed itself in the  case of the  gold-exchange  standard, i.e.,  that it is a  fair-weather  device,  which would be  liable  to accentuate distrust in a period of trial.    65.  We  are  impressed,  therefore, by  the inadequacy of  the suggestions  made by the Gold Delegation for the modification of  the gold  standard.   They  seem to us  wholly inadequate regarded either as a means of escape from the present international deadlock, or  as a basis for a secure international  financial  system when normal trade conditions have been re-established.   In relation,  indeed, to  the phenomena  which have made  their appearance in recent years, there is a  fundamental   inadequacy  in  the  conception  of the  need  for &quot;  economies  in the  use of gold &quot; which underlies  the Delegation^ recommendations.  The phrase implies  that the problem is to secure a  moderate, permanent and essentially inelastic increase in  the supply
 of international currency.   It was reasonable enough to envisage the problem in these terms when gold movements were conceived mainly as a means of adjusting the final balance of payments between different countries arising  from their mutual  trade  and income obligations. But in recent years the pressure towards gold movements has come mainly from capital  movements,  actual and  potential,  especially short-terin capital movements,  which  have assumed a scale so large as  to  throw fluctuations  in the balance of  trade  into  comparative insignificance.   The  likelihood of the renewed occurrence of  such capital movements will be increased in any future  period of difficulty by  the experience  of the present crisis.  No modifications of the gold standard system can be adequate which fail to provide for a safeguard against&apos;the possibility of such capital  movements.   It follows, in our judgment, that the gold standard cannot prudently be re-established as  a  working international  system, unless  it  is subjected to  a far more radical reconstruction  than can be attained by such expedients. as  it  has been usual  hitherto to consider, for economising  the  use of gold.    66.   We discuss  below  a  possible reconstruction  of  the  gold standard system which might be adequate  to the needs of the problem. For the  moment,  however,  we  are  concerned  to emphasise  how dangerous it would   be  for  Great  Britain   to  give   any under- taking   to  return   to   the   gold   standard   merely   on   the stipulation  that such minor modifications  as we have considered above  are  generally  introduced.   It is  easy to  foresee  that  a situation  may arise in which  to give some  such  undertaking  may come to  seem the only reasonable course to  take:  indeed, the  only- alternative  to finding ourselves isolated  in a  position  of  apparent obstruction to the general desire of other countries for the re-establish- nient of financial order. The conference will be under  the influence of the prevailing assumption, which is strongly held by most of the principal financial  countries and is accepted by authoritative financial circles in Great Britain,  that  the gold  standard  remains  the  only practicable basis of an orderly  international  financial  system.   The published opinions of such representative international bodies as the board of the Bank  for International Settlements and the  Gold Delega- tion of the League of Nations  have also  been regarded  as  endorsingthat view. It will be difficult to defend the indefinite maintenance ofour present exchange arrangements, with all their uncertainties andobscurities.   If,  in these circumstances, we were to confine ourselves to arguing that  we could  not safely return to gold, until somethinghad been  done to economise its  use by such modifications as we have discussed  above, and if we were met, as we might well be, by a generalreadiness  on the part of other countries to accept these  modifications in considerable part, it would become  difficult for us to adhere to ourposition that our hands must remain  entirely free.  We regard it as of the utmost importance that the British  delegates  should be on their guard against the danger of a commitment which might  involve us. ina repetition of the catastrophe of  1981.                   (c) Provisional gold parities.   67.  In our view, it is a mistake to suppose that an early return to the gold standard,  as ordinarily understood, is the only alternative to the continuance of international monetary  chaos.   The  positivecase for the gold standard system is that it confers upon international trade and international investment   the. benefits  of  stable  foreign exchanges.   It  does  this  by  fixing  the values  of  each currencypermanently, and  (subject to a breakdown of the system) irrevocably, in terms  of gold,  and consequently in terms of other  gold standard currencies.  The needs of international trade,  however, can  be largely met without going so  far as  this.    If the values of  the different currencies,  which  are  not  at  present effectively  linked with  gold, were defined in  terms of gold, not permanently and irrevocably, but provisionally, and subject  expressly to the possibility of alteration,it  being  understood,  however,  that such alterations would only  be made for  substantial reasons and by moderate amounts  at  any  time, a sufficient measure of certainty and stability in the foreign  exchanges might  be  established  to enable  the great bulk of international  trade to be carried on without serious inconvenience.   The  possibility of
1 ZflX u Ualtering  the parity in  case  of need  would  provide  an  automaticdefence  against  the  danger  of large-scale capital  movements.   a country upon which a &quot; run &quot;  was being made by  the outside world would  reduce the gold parity of its currency, so that further with-withdrawals  could  only be made at the sacrifice of an exchange  loss.We saw in 1981 that, whereas withdrawals from London continued with a gathering momentum so  long as the pound remained at parity,the movement slackened when gold payments were suspended  andwas  reversed  when sterling had fallen to a level from  which somerecovery was expected.  Unless, therefore, it  was generally  believedthat a  country&apos;s  currency  was  likely  to  undergo  a  process  ofuncontrolled inflation, it  is probable  that a moderate  lowering  ofthe gold parity,  made at an early stage of an adverse movement  ofbalances, would  suffice to check  the  movement,  without  recourse to the  restrictions on exchange  dealings and  other  expedients  towhich  the present crisis has given  rise.   (!8.   The power to vary  the  gold  parity  would possess certain other  advantages.   A  country  which  is faced  with the  necessity,perhaps  because  of a  heavy fall in  the  world prices of  its principalexports,  of  reducing largely  its gold cost of  production,  can effect this  reduction  with less internal  strain  and dislocation  by  loweringits  gold  parity than  by forcing  down the remuneration  of all itsvarious factors of production  in terms  of its own currency.   This  isa consideration  which is  of particular  importance in  the  case  of countries which concentrate on  the production of a few  commoditiesliable to large variations in price.  During the present crisis, indeed,most countries which are specialised  in  the  production of  primary products have obtained  this  relief as  the result of an  enforcedexchange depreciation.   But  if   such  exchange  depreciations  arelikely to occur in future, it might  be better if orderly provision weremade for them in  the monetary arrangements of the countries  con-cerned  rather  than  that  their   occurrence  should  represent  a breakdown.   G9.   As against  these  advantages,  the  possibility  that  a   goldparity  provisionally established  might be subsequently changed wouldbe unfavourable to fresh international long-term investment.  Unless,however, it served to  restrict  the  volume of such  investment  verydrastically,  this  would  not necessarily  be a  disadvantage.  In  a world in which international trade is subject to so many restrictions,it  is far from  clear  that  the  maximum  international  mobility  ofcapital, whether  short or long,  is really desirable.   On the contrary,as we  suggested in our introductory remarks, an  important under-lying cause of the world&apos;s present difficulties  was  the magnitudewhich  capital movements assumed in the years preceding the slump.   70.   So far as  Great Britain  is  concerned, the problem is  eom-plicated  by her  special position  as a  financial centre.    We have,therefore,  no intention  of  prejudging  any issue of ultimate policy.But  whether or  not  the gold standard is  ultimately restored as aninternational  system, a long time  might elapse before  conditionsare established which will  offer a reasonable assurance that it  willwork smoothly and securely, and it may consequently be desirable  to contemplate other  arrangements  during  this  period.   With  this possibility in mind, we are of opinion  that Great Britain should not go further in  response to pressure  to  return to a gold basis,  than to indicate her willingness to adopt a  provisional  gold parity whichwould  be subject to variation.  Such  a course,  it may be observed,would  entail  no  very radical  departure  either from our  present practice, or from the precedent set by  other countries.  We  have established  the  Exchange  Equalisation  Fund, with   the  avowedobject  of controlling  the fluctuations of the sterling exchanges.  to fix  a variable  gold parity  would  be a  natural  next step.   It  was common, in connection with the stabilisation of continental  currenciesin  the post-war decade,  for  a  long  period of so-called  de factostabilisation  to precede de jure stabilisation.   The expedient  of  atemporary  gold parity would differ only from  a dc facto  stabilisationin contemplating a  somewhat  greater possibility  of  a  subsequentvariation in  the  parity provisionally established.   We  suggest  thatit would be desirable  in defining the  provisional parity  to allow an appreciable  margin between the buying and selling price  for gold.
        r    (d) Scheme for  an international note issue.   71.  The above  suggestion  is,  however, essentially a defensiveone, and the need for a constructive policy remains.   The objectives of a constructive international  monetary policy  should be twofold :(a)   to  provide  a  way  out   from   the   present  financial  dead-lock and  to  promote a  recovery of  prices,  (b)  to establish  asystem  which  is  likely  to  work  satisfactorily  when  the  present emergency  has  passed.     For the  first  purpose,   the  essentialneed  is to  secure   an increase  in  the  supply of internationalpurchasing-power at  the disposal of the weaker financial countries.We have  already  indicated  the  difficulties  of  meeting this need bymeans  of  ordinary   loans (paragraphs  41-45);  and the questionremains whether these difficulties could be  overcome by action withinthe monetary sphere.  For  the latter purpose,  experience suggeststhat we. need,  not   so  much   measures designed to secure  smallpermanent economies in the use of gold,  but more  elastic arrange-ments.  capable of adapting  the  supply of  the means of  discharginginternational payments in  accordance  with  fluctuations of confidence and changes in the level of prices.   72.  With these general considerations in mind, we have examined the  scheme  outlined  in the  fourth  report  of  the   Committee  onEconomic Information (Council Paper E.A.C. (S.C.) 4) for authorising the Bank for International Settlements to issue notes which the various governments  of the  world would  accept as the equivalent  of  gold.The following are the  essential  features of this scheme,  as set outin paragraph 48 of the reiwrt referred to :        &quot; (a) The Bank  for  International  Settlements might  make    advances,  at  a very  low rate  of  interest,  or possibly free  of   interest,  to  the  various  governments  of  the  world, up  to an    aggregate  sum of,  say,   1,000 millions  gold,  this  sum  being    distributed among them in  accordance with some  agreed criterion    of  economic  importance. .  . .   The  advances could  be  made    subject  to appropriate  conditions,  such as  the removal  of    restrictions on exchange dealings.       (h)  To enaWe it to do so. the  Bank for International Settle-    ments  would be  authorised to issue  International Certificates.    declared  to be the equivalent  of  so many grains of gold,  and    accepted as such  by the  various governments, up to  the amount    of the advances made.       (c) If  and  when the  gold  price  level of  commodities  rosi*    substantially, the advances  would  be gradually  recalled and the    issue of certificates reduced correspondingly.  It  would be the    object of the Bank  for International Settlements,  in determining    the proportion of the advances to be recalled at any time, to prevent    an  undue rise of prices, without precipitating a  recurrence  of    depression  by  an  over-drastic  curtailment.  If  any  government    was unable to make immediate repayment of any sum  when called    upon to do so, the advance  of  this sum might be extended  at :i    comparatively high rate of interest.&quot;The report recognises that it would be difficult to secure international agreement in the selection of  a criterion  for  the distribution  of the advances among the various  governments, and suggests that the most acceptable criterion  might be &quot;a complex one, which might includeforeign trade and legal gold  reserve minima and, possibly, other ele-ments as well.&quot;  The report  further recognises that the scheme wouldrequire an amendment of the  statutes of the Bank for international settlements.   A change in  the statutes  of  the  Bank is, however.probably  in  any case  desirable, in view  of the new arrangementsfor reparation payments.    78.   On merits,  this scheme seems to us well  designed to meet thovarious requirements of the problem  which we  have set out  above-It   would  serve  all  the   purposes  of  an   international   loanwithout  diminishing  the  lending  power  of,   or  throwing   a burden  on,  the   stronger  financial  countries.    At   the   sametime,  it  would secure  a much more  substantial increase in the effective  gold supply than could be achieved by ordinary measure to economise the use of gold, and an increase, moreover, which would
 not be rigid and unvarying, but would be adjusted in accordance with changes in financial confidence and the level of commodity prices.  We are impressed in this connection with the argument of the Committee on Economic Information that for dealing with an international financial crisis there is a need for elasticity in the supply  of international currency, similar to that for an elastic internal currency which has long been  recognised in the case  of an internal financial crisis.   We would  add that the  scheme  is one which  could be fitted either to  a regime  of  provisional  gold parities  such as we have outlined  above (paragraph  67),  or  to a  return  to  the gold  standard principle of permanent gold parities.   It would  clearly be an essential condition of the  receipt of an  advance from the Bank for International Settle- ments  under  (a) in the  preceding  paragraph that  the  government receiving it, if not now effectively on a gold basis, should undertake to accept gold or the  new International Certificates  in exchange for its  own  currency at  some defined rate.   But  this  rate  might be fixed  subject  to  modification:  and, in the first instance  at  least, it would, no doubt, be desirable that it  should  be so fixed.    74.  In appraising the merits of the scheme, it is necessary to bear in mind the twofold nature of the problem: the need for a  solution of the  world&apos;s emergency difficulties, as well as for the establishment of a reliable system for the future.  If the former aspect of the problem is neglected, it can be objected  that the scheme is unduly favourable to the financially embarrassed countries and to countries with  small gold reserves as compared with strong creditor countries and countries with  large  reserves.    For  the  likelihood  would  be  that  the International  Certificates would tend to flow  from the debtor to th.j creditor countries: while  the risk of loss which the  scheme entails (that, namely, of a depreciation  in the commodity value of gold) would fall  on countries in  proportion  to  their  gold reserves.   But this objection only possesses cogency on the assumption that the  creditor countries  have no material interest in  restoring the  position of the debtor countries.   If,  on the other hand, the principle is accepted that it  is worth the while  of the  financially stronger countries  to incur some risk  in  the cause of world  recovery, there could hardly  be  a lesser risk  than that which they would  run under the above scheme. If the  financially embarrassed countries were to be assisted by  loans guaranteed by the governments of the  lending peoples, and  if  these- countries were subsequently to default, the loss to the lending peoples would be tangible and substantial, taking the form of a heavy increase- in taxation.  But if  the financially embarrassed countries were  to be- assisted in the way contemplated  under the above scheme, and  were later to  refuse,  or  prove unable,  to  meet  the  not  very  onerousobligations which it  would impose on them, the only way in which other countries would stand to suffer would be through a depreciation in the commodity  value of their gold holdings,  i.e., a somewhat higher level of gold prices in the world  at large than  would otherwise have been established.    This  is not   a  type of  risk from which in present circumstances  any  country  has any  substantial reason to shrink.    75.  We do not think, therefore, that  there is  much real weight in the objections that  might be urged  against the scheme from the standpoint  of the interests of the creditor countries.   It  would be desirable, however, to  meet possible criticisms of this kind as far as possible.  For this purpose we suggest that the scheme might provide that a  country which was subject to an outward movement of funds should not be entitled to meet  this outflow entirely  by a release ofInternational  Certificates, but  should  be  required  to release  panpassu a proportional amount of  gold.   Formal provisions to  safe- guard the  Bank for International Settlements, in the event of any default, have  already been suggested in the report of the Committeeon Economic  Information.  , 76.  We recognise, as does the Committee on Economic Informa- tion,  that  it  is  unlikely  that  so  unfamiliar  a   scheme  would immediately  commend  itself to. the  other  governments  represented at the  conference.   We do not think,  for reasons  that we  develop-later, that this is necessarily  a conclusive reason why  the  BritishGovernment  should  refrain  from  putting it forward.   But  the     F75141                                                E
 acceptability of a scheme is obviously a point of the first importance. The essential principles of  the scheme we have discussed are capable of being applied in a great variety of ways.  We submit for considera- tion the following  alternative application, which might offer a greater prospect of general  acceptance.     77.  The advances  to  be made by  the Bank for International Settlements might  be  limited  to loans  to the  governments  of financially embarrassed countries, and might carry a  gilt-edged rate of interest.   The  amounts advanced would be determined in each case in  accordance with  the urgent needs of the countries concerned for exceptional assistance, the issue of International Certificates being limited, of course, to the aggregate of these advances.     78.  So  modified,  the  scheme  would be  shorn of many of the features most likely to arouse  criticism and distrust. There would be no  advances to  financially strong governments which did  not need them : there would be  no  artificially low rates of interest;  in  place of the extremely difficult problem of determining a criterion for the distribution  of  benefits  among all  the  governments  of  the world, there would  be the, still difficult, but more  familiar and manageable problem of  determining the  sums which  should  be advanced to embarrassed countries in order to extricate them from their pressing difficulties;  the issue  of  International Certificates, though  still considerable, would be on  a smaller scale.    79.  Apart from these  specific  points, the general character of the scheme  would  be changed  in  a way calculated to increase its acceptability.   Its keynote  would no  longer be that of organising reflation  on  an  international  basis, but  of  organising  financial assistance to the distressed countries.  Now  as the Stresa Conference has shown, European opinion is tending to concentrate on the idea of organised international loans to countries  in especial  difficulties: and the idea is one which France, in particular, as a creditor country. is at present disposed to  favour, at any rate in certain of its applica- tions.  But France no more than Great Britain can  afford to treat with indifference the risks which guaranteed loans might  throw on her budget and her taxpayers.   In these circumstances, it cannot be regarded as beyond the bounds of reasonable  possibility that  France might be persuaded to accept a scheme which  would carry out  a purpose  which   she  supports,  while  substituting  the  risk of  a depreciation  in  the  purchasing-power   of  gold  for  the risk  of  a Budgetary  burden.    SO.   The scheme thus modified would be  a less powerful instru-ment  for  breaking  through  the economic  depression.   Since  the advances would  carry an appreciable rate  of interest, the amounts which could prudently be advanced to or accepted by  the financially embarrassed governments would be limited; and the assistance mightnot  suffice  to restore confidence in  their position or  to permit thecomplete withdrawal  of  exchange restrictions and  other  abnormaltrade  impediments.   The   limited  scheme,  moreover,  would  do nothing  directly to facilitate  the  pursuit  of  more  liberal  creditpolicies in  the countries which  did  not  receive advances,  althoughit  might do  so  indirectly in so far as  it led  to  the  repayment of loans to them.    81.   At  the  least, however,  the scheme would  avert the  dangerof a further deterioration in the international  financial position, andwould exert a strong influence  in the direction of recovery.  It would meet the urgent  needs of the financially embarrassed countries: andit  would do so,  it is important to observe, not only without  risk tothe  taxpayers of the lending countries,  but without impairing their power to lend  in  other  directions.  The international  purchasing-power which would be placed at the disposal of the borrowing countries would represent  a net addition to the  world&apos;s effective supply  of monetary gold;  and the future working of the international financialsystem would be  correspondingly eased.   If the scheme were coupled with  an  agreement on  the part of financially sound countries  to pursue a liberal  credit policy  in concert, it might be adequate  to start  a process of world  recovery.
  (e) Modified  scheme  of  an international note issue recommended.     82.   For the sake of clarity  we may reformulate the  modified scheme as follows :      (a) Those  countries whose  present position  is so embarrassed as           to call for a measure of  organised international help should           be assisted by  means of advances  made  by the Bank for           International Settlements to their  governments or central           banks, payable in the  International  Certificates described           below.     (b) To  enable  it  to make  these  advances,  the  Bank for  Inter-           national   Settlements   should  be  authorised  to   issue           International Certificates, declared  to be the equivalent of           so many  grains  of  gold,  and  accepted  as such by the           central banks of the  world, up to the limit of the aggregate           of the advances so made.     (c) The  advances would be made subject  to any conditions  as to           the  removal of  exchange  restrictions  and  other  trade           impediments which  it  was thought  prudent  to  impose.           They  should also  be subject to the condition that a country           receiving an advance,  which  is not at present effectively           on a gold basis, should fix a parity, which might, however,           be variable, between its currency and gold or international           certificates,  and  should undertake to meet any  external           drain  of  funds  by releasing gold,  up to some prescribed           percentage, as w?ell as International Certificates.     (d) The  advances might  be made in  part  for longer, and in  part       j    for shorter periods, thus permitting their gradual reduction           or  their  renewal,   as  subsequent  circumstances might           indicate  to be desirable.  As the advances were repaid, the           issue of International Certificates should be correspondingly           reduced.   In determining its policy in regard  to the recall           or the renewal  of the  advances, the  board of the Bank           for  International  Settlements  should  have regard both to-           the  position of  the debtor countries concerned and to the           desirability of maintaining a reasonable measure  of stability           in world prices.     (el The  advances would  carry  a  gilt-edged rate of interest.   The          interest  payments would enable a  guarantee fund  to be           formed against  the  possibility of  default on  the part of           any  debtor government.  The position  of  the Bank for           International Settlements should  be  further  safeguarded          by the deposit of  bonds by the  governments participating           in the scheme.    88.  We suggest that  the British Government should  endeavour at  the forthcoming conference to secure  acceptance for a scheme on the above lines.  It is true that  even in this form the scheme presents such unfamiliar  features  that  its  immediate  acceptability would be doubtful.  There are  two  powerful reasons why the British  Govern- ment should not  be deterred  on  this account from bringing it forward.*In   the  first  place,  despite  the  recent  symptoms of  economic improvement, no-one can predict with any confidence an early  solution of the world&apos;s  essential difficulties.  Internally, it may be hoped that many countries will experience  some improvement in their domestic trade activity and some relief from the strain of unremunerative selling prices.  But while this will tend  to exert a  beneficial international influence, it seems unlikely that it will go  far enough to break through the  present international  deadlock; and so long  as the international position  remains  essentially  as  it  now is, the extent of the internal recovery which any country may enjoy is likely to be limited.  Thus, in  the absence of  a  constructive policy, the  international financial problem is likely to remain  with  us for  a long period to come,  and the sense of  the vital necessity of solving it may be expected to grow- rather than  to diminish.   In these circumstances it  would be short- sighted to refrain from putting forward proposals now, merely because- time may be required to win for them general  acceptance.    84.   Secondly, we are apprehensive, as we have already  indicated,. that the British Government may  be forced to assume at  the forth-coming conference an unduly defensive attitude.  There is a  danger     [7514]                                                 F
 that we  shall  find  ourselves  in  the position  of having  to  resist proposals which are strongly urged by other countries without having any very helpful proposals  of our own to  make;  and that we shall be  charged  accordingly  with obstructionism.   It would  be  very unfortunate that  we  should expose ourselves  unnecessarily to this charge, especially  at  a conference  to be held in London.   Against this danger,  the submission of a constructive policy is the  best pro- tection; and it might be unwise, therefore,  to refrain from submitting a constructive policy which  we believe would be desirable on merits, merely because we doubt whether it would prove acceptable to others.     85.  This consideration  possesses considerable  force,  in  that  we could  fairly argue, if  we were to put forward the scheme we  have. suggested, that we had offered the only hopeful means both of realising the specific objects which almost all countries accept, and of promoting world  recovery on  a basis offering the prospect of  permanence.   It is common  ground  in  all  countries  that  the revival of  world  trade demands the removal of the  exchange restrictions and other abnormal trade  impediments of the present  time.  But,  as we have argued above, it is difficult to make any considerable progress towards their removal,  so long as the financial  conditions which have given rise to them  remain: and this argument will certainly he turned against us if we press for their removal without offering any contribution to the solution of  the financial problem.  The Continent,  accordingly, looks in the direction of relieving  the  financial deadlock by schemes of international loans.  But the difficulties of solving the problem by that means are  real  and  formidable.   The possibility  of  imposing a substantial  risk oh the budgets of  the  creditor countries is limited; the lending capacity of the  creditor countries is also limited.   It is likely that  the  task of stressing these difficulties will  fall mainly on ourselves.   This  task  would be much less ungracious if we were to point  out at the same  time  that these difficulties could be overcome, and were to propose  that they should be overcome by the scheme outlined above.  We should have no difficulty in demonstrating that the scheme was well  fitted  to meet the essential needs of the  world problem, that it would  enable advances to be made to the embarrassed countries without  depleting the  financial resources of the lending countries, that it would thus relieve the international financial tension and prepare the way for the  removal of trade harriers.     86.  On merits, indeed,  the case for some such scheme is so strong: that we cannot believe that  there is any insuperable bar to its accept- ance, given not only patient and persuasivehandling, but also convinced and persistent advocacy.  It is true that it involves a  new  departure in the sphere of monetary affairs, but the  departure represents a  not unnatural evolution  in the  functions of the Bank for International Settlements, one, indeed, that was suggested in the discussions which preceded its establishment.  It could hardly be objected to the scheme that,  while  primarily designed  to  meet  the  needs of the present emergency situation, it would also help to solve the long-run problem of supplementing  the  effective world  supply  of  monetary gold,  and- thereby facilitating the maintenance of a higher level of prices:  for these  are  needs  which  have  received general  and  authoritative recognition.  From this standpoint, indeed, the scheme would merely represent a  means,  better  adapted  than experience has shown  the -gold-exchange  standard  to  be,  of  carrying   out  the  currency recommendations  of  the Genoa Conference.   Nor would  there be anything inappropriate in basing a new monetary system on the needs of  an emergency  situation.   That,  after all,  is  how the Bank of  England and its note-issue came  into existence.
               V.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.    S7.   We  summarise  our conclusions  as  follows:                          INTRODUCTORY.    (1) We  assume  that the  objective  of  the forthcoming  World Economic and Financial Conference is to facilitate a recovery from the present international financial crisis and  economic depression and to secure an  increase in the international interchange of commodities and services  on a basis which promises  stability and  permanence.. (Paragraph 1.)    (2) The  questions  which will come  before  the Conference have been envisaged from the beginning as falling into two parts, financial questions  on the one  hand, and economic  questions on  the other. We think it  important that  this division  should not  lead  to an obscuring  of  the essential interconnection between the two classes of question.   (Paragraph 2.)                        I    (3) There  is  a  fundamental  connection between  the  scale  of international payments which the world&apos;s financial system can succeed in discharging,  and  the  volume  of  international trade  whioh the commercial  systems of the  world render possible.  To assert  this interconnection  should  be  a  constant  concern  of  British policy. (Paragraphs 3 and 4.)    (4) The  exchange restrictions,  the  import prohibitions, and the tariff surtaxes, which have been  imposed with such profusion in the past year, are largely the result of the  acute international financial crisis.  Unless it is  possible to find a solution for the  problems in this sphere,  it is unlikely that it will be  possible  to make any  real progress in the other.   (Paragraphs 5-9.)                   I.-COMMERCIAL  POLICY.                  (a) Temporary  trade restrictions.    (5)  It will not be easy to do more  at  the forthcoming  conference. with  regard  to temporary trade  restrictions than  to secure general resolutions urging their  removal at the earliest practicable moment. Few  countries will   be  willing, in practice,  to relax them in  any appreciable degree,  so long as the financial conditions  which  have. given rise to them remain.   (Paragraph  10.)                 (b)  Permanent commercial  policy.    (6)  The opportunities of useful  action in  the sphere of  long-term commercial policy may  be  limited  by  the  commitments of  the participants  in the  conference.  But  it  may be  possible  to secure. agreement to certain principles of tariff  making.   (Paragraph  11.)                   (i) Review of  tariff schedules.    (7)  The conference might be induced to recommend that nations should  carefully  consider their  existing tariff schedules with a view to removing  anomalies.  It would be of advantage to world trade if it  were recognised  that  no  industry  which has   not a reasonable expectation of supplying a substantial part of  the home market should be given protection.   (Paragraph  12.)                            (ii) Quotas.    (8)  So far as it can do so consistently with the Ottawa  agreements, the British Government might  advantageously attack the  system of quotas  on  imports.   We realise that the  meat quota  arrangement which  we have entered into at Ottawa must make it  more difficult for us to take a strong line  in opposition to quota schemes.  Thisshould not; however,  preolude us  from  urging the conference to take steps  to limit the growth  of  the  system and to secure its abolitionwhen  more  normal world  conditions are restored.  (Paragraph  13.)    [7514]                                               F 2
    (iii)  Regional tariff agreements and  the  most-favoured-nation                               clause.    (9) There  is  a strongly-marked  tendency in  the world  to-day towards  regional  tariff  agreements.  These  involve  discrimination between  imports from countries which are parties to such an agree- ment  and imports from  other countries.  They  are thus in conflict with the principle of &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot;  treatment, embodied in the majority of  commercial treaties.   The  British  Government has always attached great importance to this clause  and has  declined to facilitate regional  tariff arrangements by  agreeing  to  its infraction. The  movement  towards  regional  tariff agreements has,  however, persisted, as the recent Dutch-Belgo-Luxemburg agreement testifies. Meanwhile, the situation has been materially changed by the alteration of fiscal  policy in Great  Britain and the large extension  of  inter- imperial  preferences.  Such preferences  would be  a violation  of the most-favoured-nation  clause if it were not for what, in Continental-eyes, appears the  legal formality of  a common  sovereignty.  (Para- graphs 14-16.)    (10)  The method  of regional multilateral concession is  probably the  only  method by which a reduction of tariff barriers in the  world can  be secured,  and it is by  no means  clear that  it would be wisepolicy  for  Great  Britain  to  obstruct  such development.   (Para- graphs 17 and 18.)    (11)  Moreover, it  will probably prove impracticable to secure for very long the maintenance of the most-favoured-nation clause  in its present form.   (Paragraph 19.)    (12)  We are therefore  unanimously  and   strongly of  the opinion that the British Government would be well advised to  make a virtue of necessity in good time and  to indicate  its readiness to consider  aredefinition of  the clause.   The object of  this should  be to preventbilateral  tariff  agreements from assuming  an exclusive character, byensuring  the  benefits of   most-favoured-nation  treatment to any country  willing  to adhere  to  the provisions of the  agreement  orpursuing  a  tariff policy not less liberal than that of the parties to it.Special  safeguards might  be  necessary,  however,  to  protect  theposition of  Great Britain, in view  of the  complications arising fromthe  system of  imperial preference.  We  believe that the  practical alternative  to  a reinterpretation of the most-favoured-nation  clause will  be first an  increasing evasion of it, and ultimately  its generalabrogation.   (Paragraphs 20 and 21.)                        (c)  Shipping policy.    (13)  As regards shipping,  British policy should  be  directed  to securing  the abandonment  of  shipping  subsidies and  of  all acts offlag  discrimination.   We should take our stand on the  principle of equality of  treatment  for all ships, under  all flags,  in  all ports, andin all  trades.   (Paragraphs  22  and 23.)               II. PRODUCERS&apos;  AGREEMENTS.   (14)  As only  the  industrial  interests concerned  can  actuallynegotiate producers&apos; agreements, the British  Government need onlyconsider  the general attitude  which  it  should assume.  This  mightwell  be  in  conformity  with  the  recommendations  of   the  world economic Conference of  1927.  We are  not of opinion that  such agreements  in general have any promising  contribution  to offer tothe  solution of the present world  difficulties.  On the  other  hand,there  is  no reason why  the British Government  should discourageany  movement  in this  direction,  provided that  the  safeguardscontained in the resolutions of the World Economic Conference areobserved.   (Paragraphs 24-26.)                   III.-DEBTS  AND  LOANS.    (15)  A large  number of debtor countries will press for the writingdown  of commercial  obligations  which they cannot fulfil at  the present level of prices. Great Britain must necessarily  consider theserequests  from  the standpoint of  an   interested  creditor  country. (Paragraphs 27-29.)
            (a) Consolidation of short-term obligations.    (16) An  important  feature  of  the  present  difficulties  is  the excessive  external  short-term indebtedness of  certain  embarrassedcountries.   These  short-term   obligations  should  eventually   be converted into  long-term  obligations, but  before this  can be  done it will be necessary to devise a scheme distinguishing between thosedebtors who  are  solvent  in their  own  currency and those  who,temporarily  at any  rate, are insolvent.   (Paragraphs 30-32.)               (b)  Writing down of long-term debts.    (17) Manifest  dangers will  attach to  any attempt to evolve atthe conference a general scheme for the  writing down of long-termdebts; first because ability to pay  will  depend  on the  future courseof prices and international trade;  secondly because such  an attemptmight retard  recovery by undermining the confidence of investors.(Paragraphs 33-35.)    (18) Experience suggests that  there is need for  more effectiveorganisation in ail lending countries.  Generally we should  like tosee more active councils of foreign bondholders established and greatercollaboration  between  those  in different  financial centres.  (Para-graph 36.)    (19) The  general position of the British Government should bethat  obligations which a debtor country may be unable to  meet atpresent but which it  could  meet,  if world trade and prices were to recover,  should be maintained  intact as  far as  possible,  relief of  atemporary  character  being   given  where necessary.  It  would  bedesirable, that the duration  of  the period of relief should be defined in  terms of  the  movement  of commodity prices.  (Paragraphs 37and 38.)    (20)  The  principle of linking financial payments  with the move-ment of prices might  be  advantageously  applied in  connection withthe issue of  new  international loans.  The forthcoming  conference might well  invite the  League to establish and  maintain an authori-tative index-number  of world-prices,  which  might  by  agreementbetween  borrower  and lender  be  made  the  basis for varying theinterest  receivable upon new international loans  in sympathy withmovements in the prices of  commodities.   (Paragraphs 39 and 40.)                        (c) Guaranteed loans.    (21)  Further  international   lending  is  required  to  restart theprocess of  international trade.   Foreign loans  could  at present onlybe raised with the  help of the guarantee of governments in  creditorcountries.  But even in the financially strongest countries,  govern- ments are  not in  a position to undertake liabilities for  loans  up  tothe amount necessary for this purpose.  Fresh international assistance should be provided in such  a way  as to enable  advances to be  made to the embarrassed oountries without depleting the financial resourcesof the creditor countries.  (Paragraphs 41 to 45 above and (32) below.)                         (d) Interest rates.    (22)  Financially  strong  countries can assist  the  financially weak indirectly by  promoting the establishment at  home of lower ratesof interest.   From this standpoint,  the British  conversion soheme  isah important contribution to world recovery.  (Paragraphs 46 and 47.)            IY. MONETARY  AND CREDIT   POLICY.    (23) In regard to  many  matters the  British  Government will  be &quot;compelled  by  circumstances  to assume a predominantly defensive attitude  against demands made  upon it.  It  is  desirable  therefore that  in the  sphere  of monetary  questions the British  Government should assume a constructive  role.  (Paragraph 48.)    (24) The British  Government should  not depart from  its position -that  it  cannot  contemplate a  return  to gold   under  such unstable conditions  as now  prevail.   (Paragraphs 49 and 50.);
       (a) The difficulty  of re-constitutiny the gold standard.    (25) The  central  fact  which  has led  to,  and aggravated,  thepresent international financial crisis has been  the increasing tendency to remove short-term balances  abruptly from one financial centre toanother in accordance with passing fluctuations of confidence, thoughthe stability of the gold standard system requires that such movementsshould not take place on any considerable scale.  Since the breakdown of tiie gold  standard in Great  Britain, the strongest currencies mustnecessarily be much more liable to external runs and perhaps internalflights.   The gold exchange standard system widely  adopted as  aresult  of  the recommendations of the Genoa Conference,  by whichthe central  banks of many countries hold part of their legal reserves in the form of foreign  exchange assets,  has suffered  a  serious  and perhaps a fatal blow.  (Paragraphs  51-57.)    (26) This system  for  a  time diminished  the pressure upon  theavailable supply  of monetary gold, but it added to the instability ofthe international  financial position  after the world depression  had begun.  It  would be  unwise to rest the monetary structure  of  theworld exclusively on the  basis which  has proved so precarious.   Inaddition,  it  would be difficult to persuade  central  banks  again tohold their legal  reserves  on any  considerable scale  in the form offoreign  exchange assets.   (Paragraphs 58 and 59.)   (b) The danger of any  British undertaking to return to gold.   (27) The  shortage  of gold  which  the gold  exchange  standardsystem  was designed to  meet remains.   The proposals for economy in the  use of gold  made by  the Gold  Delegation  of the FinancialCommittee of the League of Nations are  quite insufficient to  afford a reasonable presumption that a restored gold standard would be free from  the  dangers which have overwhelmed it in recent  years.  Nomodifications  of the gold standard  system  can  be  adequate  whichfail to provide for or safeguard  against  the possibility of  large-scalecapital movements.  A situation  may, however, arise at the conferencein which  to give some undertaking  to  return  to gold may be  theonly alternative to finding ourselves isolated in a position of apparentobstruction to the general desire of other countries for the re-establish-ment of financial order.  It is  of the utmost importance that  theBritish Government should be on its guard against this danger,  whichmight involve us in a  repetition of the catastrophe of 1931.  (Para-graphs  60-66.)                   (c) Provisional  gold  parities.   (28) An early return to the gold  standard, as  ordinarily  under-stood,  is not the only alternative to the continuance of international monetary  chaos.  The needs of international trade could be  largelymet  if the values of the different currencies were  defined in terms ofgold, not  permanently and irrevocably, but provisionally, and subjectexpressly  to the possibility of alteration.   The possibility of altering the  parity would provide an  automatic defence  against the  dangerof  large-scale  capital  movements.   In  addition,  gold ,  costs  ofproduction can  be reduced  if necessary with less  internal strain  anddislocation by lowering the gold  parity than by forcing  down  the remuneration  of the  various faotors of production in terms of theirown  currency.  (Paragraphs 67  and 68.)   (29) As against these advantages,  the possibility of variations inthe  gold  parity  would be  unfavourable  to  fresh  international long-term investment.  But it is doubtful whether the maximum  inter-national mobility of capital, whether short or long, is really desirable.(Paragraph 69.)   (30) We are, therefore, of the opinion that Great Britain shouldnot  go further in response to pressure to return to a gold basis,  than to indicate her willingness to adopt  a provisional gold  parity which.would  be  subject to  variation.   (Paragraph .70.)
           (d)  Scheme for an international note issue.   (31) The objectives of a constructive international monetary policy should be twofold: (a) to provide a way out from the present financialdeadlock and  to promote  a recovery of prices,  (b) to  establish  asystem  which  is likely  to work  satisfactorily  when  the  present emergency has passed.  With  these general considerations in mind,we  have examined the scheme for an  international note issue out-lined in the fourth report of the Committee on Economic Information(Council Paper E.A.C. (S.C.) 4).  (Paragraphs 71 and 72.)   (32) This  scheme which   is  equally  suitable  to a regime  of provisional or fixed gold parities seems to  us  well  designed  to meetthe urgent needs of financially embarrassed countries.  It would serveall  the purposes of  an  international loan without diminishing  thelending power  of, or  throwing a burden  on,  the  stronger financialcountries.  At  the same time, it would serve to secure a substantial and  elastic increase  in  the effective gold supply.  (Paragraphs  73and 74.)   (33) The scheme  might be modified to provide that a  country which  was subject to an outward movement of funds should not beentitled to meet this outflow  entirely  by a release of  InternationalCertificates,  but  should  be   required  to  release,  pari passn,  aproportional amount  of  gold.   (Paragraph  75.)   (34) With  a  view to increasing  the probability of the soheme&apos;acceptance, the advances to be made by the Bank for international settlements  might  be  limited  to  loans  to  the  governments  offinancially embarrassed countries,  and might carry a gilt-edged rateof interest.  (Paragraphs 76-78.)   (35) Its keynote  would no longer be that of organising  reflationon an international basis, but of organising  financial assistance to the distressed  countries.   The  scheme  thus modified  would be a  lesspowerful  instrument  for  breaking  through  the economic depression.At the least, however, it would avert the danger of a further deterioration-tion in  the international financial position,  and would  exert  a strong.influence  in  the direotion  of  recovery.  (Paragraphs  79-81.) (e) Modified scheme of an international note issue recommended.    (36) We formulate our modified scheme as follows:     (a)  Those countries whose present position is so embarrassed as.          to call for a measure of organised international help should          be assisted  by means of  advances made by the Bank for          International Settlements  to  their  governments or central          banks,  payable in the  International  Certificates described          below.    (b)  To enable it  to  make advances, the Bank  for International          Settlements should  be  authorised  to  issue  International          Certificates declared  to be  the equivalent  of so  many grains          of gold, and accepted as  such by the central banks of the          world,  up  to the limit  of the aggregate of the  advances          so made.    (c)  The advance  would be made subject to conditions as to the          removal of  exchange and other  restrictions,   and to the.          establishment of  a parity (either temporary or permanent)          between the internal currency and  gold,  in the  countries.          receiving advances.    (d)  The advances might be made in part for longer,  and in part.          for shorter  periods,  thus permitting their gradual reduction          or their  renewal,   as   subsequent  circumstances  might          indicate to be desirable.    (e)  The advances  would carry  a gilt-edged  rate of interest.   The.          interest payments would  enable a  guarantee  fund to  be          formed against  the  possibility of  default on  the  part of          any debtor  government.   The position of the Bank for Inter-          national Settlements, should  be further safeguarded by the.          deposit of  bonds by the  governments  participating in the.          scheme.  (Paragraph 82.)BBS&apos;
   (37) It is common  ground in all countries that the revival  of world trade demands the removal  of the  exchange restrictions andother abnormal  trade impediments of the present time.  But it isdifficult to make any  considerable progress  towards their  removal,so long as the  financial conditions  which have given  rise to themremain, and  this argument will certainly be  turned  against us if wepress for their  removal  without offering any  contribution  to  thesolution of the financial problem.  The Continent, accordingly, looksin the direction  of  relieving  the financial deadlock by schemes  ofinternational  loans.  But  the difficulties  of  solving the problem  bythat means are  real and  formidable.  The possibility of imposing asubstantial risk  on  the  budgets of the creditor  countries is limited;the lending capacity of the creditor  countries is also  limited. It islikely that the task  of stressing  these difficulties will  fall mainly  onourselves.  This task would be much less ungracious if we were topoint out at  the same time that  these difficulties could be overcome,and  were to propose that they should be overcome by the  scheme outlined  above.   We should have no difficulty in demonstrating thatthe scheme was well fitted to  meet the essential needs of the worldproblem, that it would enable advances to be  made to the embarrassedcountries without depleting  the financial resources of the  lendingcountries, that it would thus relieve the international financial tensionand  prepare  the  way  for  the  removal  of trade  barriers.  (Para-graphs 83-85.)    (38)  On  merits,  indeed,  the case for some such  scheme is so strong that we  cannot  believe that  there is any  insuperable bar toits acceptance,  given not only patient and  persuasive handling,  butalso convinced and persistent advocacy.

I have signed this Report as I am in agreement with its recommen-dations. so far as they go.  I should personally, however, have preferreda different perspective and emphasis, particularly in regard to commer-cial policy.  Upon this, as my colleagues on the Committee are aware.I have been asked in another connection to put my views before theGovernment.                                        (initialled)     W.  T.
