The  King&apos;s Speech on the Opening  of Parliament.                    NOVEMBER 22,  1932.MY LORDS AND  MEMBERS  OF  THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.    In accordance with the conclusions reached by the Conference at Lausanne,a World Economic  Conference is to be convened  by the League of Nations andwill be held in London as soon as possible next year.  It is My earnest hope thatthe Conference will be able to reach agreement on the measures required to dealwith  the causes which have brought about the present economic and  financial difficulties  of the world.    The Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments now sittingat Geneva  embodies the hope and  the  effort of  mankind to reach the greatestmeasure  of general disarmament that can be attained.   My Government willcontinue, in full co-operation  with all the  other members of the Conference, towork  for an international  convention which will be a  foundation for a lasting peace.    My  Ministers  and other  members of both  your Houses are meeting  in conference  representatives of the Indian States and of British India.  They hopethereafter  to place  before you proposals for further constitutional development in India.   The decisions to be taken will  be of great moment to  the whole ofMy Empire, and I shall watch your deliberations Avith deep interest.MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE  OF COMMONS,    The  Estimates  for the  Public Service will be laid before you in  due course.MY LORDS AND  MEMBERS  OF THE  HOUSE OF COMMONS,    Although the various conversion schemes which have been successfully carried through offer the prospect of large reductions in the service of the National Debt,it is still necessary  to exercise careful supervision over public expenditure, both national and local.    The  measures already  taken to assist British industry in the home market and to improve our markets overseas have created  a feeling of greater confidence.My Government will continue to do everything in their power to stimulate  the recovery of trade.    Agriculture has long been depressed  by the general fall in the wholesale prices of its products.  My  Ministers recognise that though the measures recently taken in regard to meat  and  other  products have been of real assistance  to producers, further plans are necessary to enable agriculture as a whole to take its proper place in the economy of the  nation.  While the  restoration of prosperityto agriculture cannot be expected until wholesale prices have risen to a more normal level, My Government believe that the various steps which they havetaken, combined with action upon the investigations concluded, or still proceeding,Avill enable the industry to put itself in a  position to take full advantage of a return to more favourable conditions.    Large  numbers of My people are still unable to find employment and  thepersistence of this  situation  causes Me the greatest anxiety.   Unemploymentas we have known  it for some years is undoubtedly the gravest of our social problems.  In particular I am distressed that  many  young men and womenhave never in their lives had an opportunity of regular employment.    [7s6o]
    In the view of My Ministers any provision for unemployed persons shouldnot only afford material assistance  but should also be designed to maintain theirmorale and their fitness to resume work when opportunities can be found.  my government  intend to bring  forward Measures dealing comprehensively with unemployment Insurance  and with  the treatment of those unable to obtainwork, and the considerations I have mentioned will be borne in mind in framingtheir proposals.    Bills  relating  to Scotland will  be introduced to amend  the  proceduregoverning private legislation, to facilitate the administration of civil justice, andfor other purposes.    Measures dealing with Rent Restriction,  London Passenger Transport, andother matters of importance will be introduced and proceeded with as time and opportunity offer.    I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
