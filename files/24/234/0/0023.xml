COPY NO.  2CP.  373  (32).                               THE CABINET.DISARMAMENT.      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR.    Subjoined  is a copy of a paper  which I handed to my colleagues during  thediscussion at yesterday&apos;s Cabinet (56 (32)).                                                                         H.    THE WAR OFFICE,           1st November, 1932.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.     1. I discuss in this Paper the effect  of the proposal to reduce armaments  to thequalitative level of those allowed to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.     The arms forbidden to Germany are as follows :                   Field guns above 77 mm.                  Howitzers above 105 mm. (4&apos;2-inch).                  Tanks.                  Armoured cars.                  Aircraft.                  Anti-aircraft guns.     2. It must be remembered that the scale of armaments was  fixed for Germany onthe basis  that, in accordance with Article 160 of the Treaty, &quot; the Army shall be devoted exclusively to the maintenance  of order within the territory and to the control ofthe frontiers.&quot;  It was framed at a time when passions  engendered by the War werehigh, and was imposed by force of arms by victorious allies determined to facilitate thetask of rendering Germany powerless to  resist forcible  measures for compelling  herobservation  of  the Treaty, should the need  arise.   It  does  not follow that it is  asuitable standard for all states and under all circumstances.     Furthermore, it  was  clearly the intention of  the  Treaty  that the  armamentstherein  prescribed were for  internal order in a  country without any colonies oroverseas territories aiid surrounded  by States members of the League of Nations.The position of Great Britain is widely different.  She administers  vast and, in somecases, uncivilized colonial territories  where  the  maintenance  of  order  and defence against aggression is a very serious military responsibility and where her neighboursare in  some cases  neither members  of  the  League nor bound  by decisions of  aDisarmament Conference.    It is clearly  illogical,  therefore, apart from any  other considerations, that a great  Colonial Power should be invited to accept the same scale of armaments as a country with  no colonial possessions  at all (e.^., armoured carsemployed on several of our frontiers).     3. Article  164  of the Peace Treaty  states that &quot;Up till the time  at  which germany is  admitted  as a member of the  League of Nations the  Germans must not possess armaments greater  than the  amounts fixed in  Table II annexed to thissection ...&quot;  The phraseology of this Article clearly indicates what was in the minds of the framers of the  Treaty.  They regarded the actual scales laid down for Germany asa temporary measure and punitive in character, and designed to prevent the possibilityof aggression on her  part.   The  implication of the Article is that when Germany wasonce more admitted  into the  comity of nations  some relaxation of the  disarmamentclauses of the Treaty might be considered, not that the Allied Powers should reduce tothe German scale.
     4.  The point may be raised that to all intents and purposes the weapons forbidden to Germany did not exist  in  1914, and that in consequence  we should be  none the worse if all States were reduced to the 1914  level.   (Such an argument would not be strictly accurate, as military aircraft did exist in  embryo  in  1914, and the  guns andhowitzers used in the field  were greater than 105 mm.)  The answer t6 this contention,so far as the  British Army is  concerned, is that since 1914 we have reduced the Armyby 21 battalions of British and 6 battalions of Colonial infantry, 9 cavalry regimentsand  61  batteries and companies of artillery.   While I am not prepared to  say that this very large post-war reduction exactly balances the increased destructive power given bymechanized  weapons, machine  guns, heavy artillery  and  aircraft, it  is definitely  myopinion that  the reversion to  1914 armaments  would  mean a very  considerable expansion of the present size  of  the Army.   A further point in connection with the1914 armaments is that since that date we have acquired  new overseas territories andmore extended  responsibilities.  It is unnecessary for me to enlarge  upon the graveunrest  which prevails  in   many parts  of  the world  to-day where we  have directresponsibilities and have had to employ our armed forces.     No great Colonial Power administers its overseas  territories with anything likethe  economy  of  force  and,  incidentally,  of  expenditure that we  observe.   It is interesting to extract  figures in this  connection  from  the  elaborate table prepared bythe American delegation and issued  in connection with the Hoover Plan.        Proportion of troops, including air forces, per thousand of population in                               overseas territories.Great Britain (exclusive of India)India  ...France ...SjKll 11  a a *     a * *     * a a     a * aitflly   ...     . a *     . * *     ... 1-17  -832 4-1530-212-4     It is quite certain that the abolition  of  mechanized  forces and  aircraft  would necessitate a very large increase in the above percentage so far as we are concerned.     5. I  will  now proceed  to  deal with  the  qualities  of the  particular  weaponsconcerned.                                     (i) Guns.     The upper limit of guns and howitzers permitted to Germany is 105 mm.  If wewere to reduce to that level it would mean the scrapping of the whole of our medium artillery and field howitzers  (4-5-inch).  We should have no field howitzers within theprescribed figure and we could hardly be expected to be satisfied with nothing but field guns.  The only result would  be  that we  should have to manufacture howitzers of105 mm. which, if provided upon the same scale as our present  equipment, would  costsomewhere about   3,500.000.  Furthermore,  I  consider  that  the 6-inch  howitzer,which is not a weapon  capable of destroying permanent fortifications or of any greatattacking power, is absolutely essential for  our needs  in the case of operations  on theNorth-West Frontier and in other possible theatres in the East.  .                          (ii)  Tanks and armoured cars.     Since it was decided  that the  German Army should not be allowed &quot; tanks,&quot; thegeneral use of the cross-country track vehicle and the internal combustion engine hasrevolutionized the  whole situation  and made the  definition of  &quot; tank&quot; of extreme difficulty.  The same remark applies to the armoured  car.  In the Army the team of horses is  being rapidly replaced in all the different branches by the mechanical tractor ;the same process is taking place  in civil life.   As it happens, practically the same cross-country  motor-driven chassis is used  in the various corps of  the Army with bodiesdiffering  only in  detail  in  the various corps, and the names applied to these vehiclespractically depend on the corps in which  they are used.  In the Royal Tank Corpsthe chassis with an armoured body of varying thickness, armed with either a machine gun or a  small gun, or with both, is called a &quot; tank.&quot;  In the infantry the same chassiswith  or  without armour  and mounting  a  machine gun, which can  he fired from thechassis or from the ground, is called a &quot; machine  gun carrier.&quot;   In the  artillery, thesame chassis with or without armour is used to haul the gun or alternately to carry thegun, and even when the gun is  hauled, a certain amount of armour is given for theprotection of the detachment.                       \
(B32/8) SO 11/5*2 W.O.P. 0G77     From tliis, I think it can be seen that the definition of a &quot; tank,&quot; as I have statedin a previous paper, can depend solely on weight.   It would be ridiculous to sanction the hauling of a weapon by a vehicle and to forbid the carrying of the weapon with thesame vehicle.     The  same remark applies  to  the armoured  car, which is merely a reconnoitringvehicle, equally essential in defence as in offence.  The modern tendency is to decreasethe  amount of armour ;  in  fact, the most modern armoured car has got very littlearmour.   It is merely a motor car of military  pattern,  with a  machine  gun, and practically any motor car could be  rapidly turned to that use.  To abolish &quot; armoured cars&quot; would be almost ridiculous, as practically any steel-made car becomes an armoured car when the steel is sufficiently thick.     Tanks  are eminently life-saving weapons and are essential  for the support  of infantry.  They are definitely the  weapons  of  small volunteer armies like  ours, andcompensate in some small degree for lack of numbers as compared to the large conscriptarmies of  the  Continent.  The qualities of both tanks and armoured cars make them of the greatest value in maintaining order and in the policing of colonial territories andfrontiers.  Their  disappearance would necessitate large increases in  other arms.     It is an interesting comment upon the modern use of  mechanized vehicles that,  inorder to assist, Germany in maintaining internal order, the  Allied Powers consented  to relax the  provisions of the Peace  Treaty to the extent of  allowing the German police150 armoured  cars for police purposes.                              (iii) Anti-aircraft guns.     Even if all  military aeroplanes are  abolished  and civil aircraft internationalized,the anti-aircraft  gun must  remain for  exactly the same  reason that  now, when gaswarfare is abolished, the gas mask is still  essential to meet  a situation such as occurred in the  early days of 1915.   Any private aeroplane could  be  used for  reconnoitringpurposes,  were the anti-aircraft gun  not  ready ou  tbe spot, to keep it off.  Moreover,as our experience again showed  in  1915, the  pledged word of a combatant  may turnout valueless, and the danger  of gas from the air  is one against which it would becriminal  not to   take  every  precaution.  Like every science, anti-aircraft  gunneryrequires deep  thought and much  practice, and cannot  be  improvised at a  moment&apos;notice.  This again was fully demonstrated in the late war.     6. To sum up, there  appears to  me to  be  no  reason  why we should accept thepunitive  measures  applied to Germany  in  1919  under conditions which are totally different from  those  which exist in this country with our immense  colonial Empire.The abolition  of  these  weapons would mean very large increases in  the Army, graveanxieties in the maintenance of order, and greatly increased  loss of life  in any future operations which  we may be compelled to conduct.     I will quote again, in conclusion, the last sentence of D.C.M. (32) 13 of 4th April,1932, where I made certain proposals for Disarmament :           &quot; I have carefully considered the limit to which  wc can go with heavy guns     and heavy tanks,  and I  have come to the conclusion that the 6-2-inch mobile gun     and the 16-ton tank is a line of demarcation low enough  substantially to weaken     the power of aggression  and give real  assistance to the defence, yet at the same     time not too  low to deprive us  of essential weapons  for  the responsibilities which     we have to shoulder in various parts of the globe.&quot;                                                                  G. F. M ,                                                                       C.I.G.S.     THE  WAR OFFICE,         2Sth  October, 1932.
