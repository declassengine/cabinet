THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1932.SECRET;                                               Copy No.      jg iCP. 360 (32).CABINET.                            DISARMAMENT.    1.  TEN days ago I brought  before the Cabinet the situation regarding disarmament in a paper (CP. 347 (32)) entitled &quot;&quot;The Disarmament Crisis,&quot; which I should be glad if  my colleagues had before  them at our meeting on Monday.  There has been no relief  to this critical situation in the interval, and I now circulate, as promised, a document bringing matters up to date.    2.  The course of intervening events has been as follows :  The Four-Power Conference.    The Cabinet will recall that this proposal had its origin in a suggestion made by the Prime Minister on the 30th  September (see CP. 338 (32)).  Our discus- sions  with M.  Herriot  in London on the 13th and 14th October resulted in a proposal that the Conference should take place in Geneva.  We and Italy both had reason to suppose that Germany would  consent, but at the last moment she refused.  I have stated in the House of Commons that the Government &quot; do not intend to let the matter drop,&quot; but in fact there is an impasse.  There is no reason to think that Germany will change her mind, and there is no indication that France  would go elsewhere.   In view of our own failure to arrive at an agreed restatement of  British disarmament policy, I am not altogether sorry that there is some hitch in the Four-Power meeting, but the final failure to arrange a meeting would be a serious matter.  Mr. Norman Davis has been pressing Count Bernstorff about it, but without success.  The  German  Government are believed to hold the view  that time  is on their side in this matter, and that in six months&apos;  time they will be in a stronger position to press their claims than now.   Certainly, the widespread demonstration of sympathy with the claim in so many British quarters supports this view.  The Cabinet should note that in  the middle of November there will be a  special meeting of the League about Manchuria and the Lytton Report, and Hen-  von Neurath  is understood to  intend  to be there.  This, therefore, may  give the opportunity for an exchange of views with Germany on disarmament, but the all-important thing is to prepare for this by settling our own disarmament programme now.The Bureau fixed, for November 3.    3.  A still  more urgent reason for reaching an immediate decision is themeeting of the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference, which Mr. Henderson hascalled for the 3rd  November.  He  is already  enquiring who will be  there torepresent and speak for the British Government. The original purpose of thismeeting was to  receive reports from various members as to the working  out ofsections of the  July  Resolution,  e.g.,  limitation of effectives, air regulation,supervision of  the execution of  the future  disarmament convention,  fixing of maximum limits for tanks and guns, &amp;c.  Mr. Henderson will also expect somereport from the British Representative on the prospect of naval agreement.  all this is difficult enough, but it is overshadowed by the prospect of the productionof the new French plan.  More information as to this will be furnished by reportsof the Debate in the French  Chamber,  which is going on to-day.  Lord Tyrrellreports  to me that M. Herriot is saying &quot; that the  choice is  between  extensivedisarmament and the rearmament of&apos;Germany, with a new race of armaments.&quot;      6585   [7769]
The Cabinet will therefore see how real the crisis is, and how impossible it willbe for the British Representative at Geneva to remain without definite Cabinetinstructions. I do not see how he can go to Geneva without. :   4.  In order that my colleagues may have before them a formulated scheme,there is appended a draft form of Declai&quot;ation,  with an explanatory note annexed,which shows more  in detail  how the formula might  be  applied.  Negotiationswith  others can  only be undertaken if  a  decision has  been reached and a policyformulated.  In this  most difficult and  anxious matter I cannot too stronglyimpress upon my colleagues the necessity of dealing now with Germanv&apos;s claim and formulating British disarmament policv in definite terms.                                                                    J.  S.    Foreign Office, October 28. 1932.     Draft Form of Declaration on Germany&apos;s Claim to Equality of Rights.     IN dealing with  the claim to equality of rights in the matter  of armaments raised by the German Government in their Note of the 29th August,  1932, it is necessary to recall that  the limitations contained in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles were imposed  as a  means  of securing the peace of Europe.   It is undoubtedly true that these limitations were intended to be, and expressed to be. the precursor  of the  general  limitation  of  armaments.   The United  Kingdom Government feel under no reproach in this regard, for their country has in  recentyears effected  immense reductions.   But  the sense of grievance on the side of Germany remains, and the United  Kingdom Government have throughout been ready and anxious to join the other Governments represented at Geneva in sincereand far-reaching steps to remove it.   It is not open to question that  the hesitation which may have shown itself in certain quarters  in granting the German claimdoes not proceed from any desire to inflict upon Germany a permanent inferiorityof status, which her people would naturally resent, but from a deep  anxiety asto the use which might be made of  the new situation and of the dangers  whichwould result to the tranquillity of Europe if an express assurance as to the peaceful intentions of Germany was not forthcoming.  The world is entitled to be assured in express and formal terms that the meeting of Germany&apos;s claim will not involve any attempt by violent means to disturb the existing territorial regime in Europe. The acknowledgment  by  others of Germany&apos;s moral right  entails upon Germany the acceptance of this corresponding obligation.    On  the assumption  that  such an  assurance  is  given,  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment in  the United Kingdom consider that the German claim to equality of rights should be fully met in the following manner :       (i) The limitations on Germany^ armaments shall be contained in the same          Disarmament Convention  as  the limitations  on  the armaments  of          others;  that  is to  say,  the Articles  in  Part  V of the  Treaty  of          Versailles  which at  present limit Germany&apos;s arms will be superseded          and Germany&apos;s limitations will be arrived at by the same process and          expressed  in the same document  as those  of all other countries.     (ii) The newly-expressed  limitations in the case of Germany will last for the          same period and be subject to the same methods of revision as those of          all  other countries.    (iii) The principle must be accepted that all States should content themselves          with the same kinds of arms,  but any  changes  in Germany&apos;s fighting          strength must be carried out in such a  way as not to conflict with the         : principle of no rearmament.    (iv)  Similar methods should be adopted for arriving  at and expressing the          limitations which will apply to the armaments of Austria, Hungary          and Bulgaria.
ANNEX. Exi&apos;*i,ANATOKV NOTE  SHOWING  HOW EFFECT  MIGHT  BE GIVEN&apos; TO  POINT  (iii)                        OF THE  DRAFT DECLARATION.                       (A) Qualitative Disarmament. (I) Nacal Armaments.                                - .     (a) It is at present impossible for the  leading naval Powers of the world to reduce the tonnage of the capital ship to the 10,000 ton limit to which Germany is restricted.  The principle, therefore, of according Germany equality of rights demands that Germany should be permitted to build ships of the same maximum tonnage with guns of the same maximum calibre as those which the great naval Powers shall agree on for the capital ship.   Put the principle that the reorganisa- tion of Germa,ny&quot;s fighting forces must be carried out in such a way as  not to conflict w ith the limitation and reduction of armaments, at the same time requires that any construction of capital ships undertaken by Germany  shall take place in such a way as not to increase the total tonnage to which her navy is at present restricted,  or to increase her total naval budgetary expenditure.     (b) His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  repeatedly  urged that the submarine should be wholly abolished.  They regard this as one of the greatest contributions that can be made to disarmament and world peace, and  incidentally as the  best way of meeting Germany&apos;s claims to equality  of treatment  in  regard  to  this weapon.   If others cannot agree to this course, we must urge the adoption by the principal  naval Powers of a total submarine  tonnage  not exceeding that  now possessed by Great Britain, followed by an all-round cut of 1/3 Which would leave the principal naval Powers with a  maximum of 35.000  tons submarine tonnage. If submarines cannot be abolished, Germany  must in  principle be allowed to possess some,  but any  construction of submarines by Germany must:  (i)  not increase her total naval tonnage; (ii) not increase her total budgetary expenditure; (iii) not exceed a number to be agreed upon with other States when the details of quantitative disarmament are negotiated. (2) Land Armaments.    (a) Tanks. The United States and Italian Governments  have  proposed the total abolition of tanks.   In view of the prohibition of tanks to Germany,  it is impossible  to  persuade Geneva that  chars  d&apos;assaut are not offensive  weapons. If,  however,  agreement cannot  at present be  reached as  to total  abolition-of the  tank,  we  should  urge that its size  shall be  reduced to 7  tons in order to convince the world that  these weapons are being retained  solely as weapons of protection. In this case the principle of equality of treatment requires that Germany  shall be permitted to possess &quot;specimen&quot; tanks not exceeding 7 tons weight, the exact number  to which  Germany will be entitled under  the Disarmament  Convention being a matter for negotiation in connection with the general question of quantitative disarmament.     (b) Large mobile land gtms. Under the Treaty of Versailles the maximum calibre of large mobile land guns permitted to Germany is 105 millim.    The obvious way of according Germany equality  of treatment in regard to this weapon, while at the same time  making a great advance in disarmament, is to press for a general reduction to this figure. (3)  Air Armaments.    The only completely satisfactory method of dealing with the future menace of bombing from the air  is the entire abolition of military, and naval aircraft, combined  with  effective  international  regulation of civil  aviation.  If,  at  the present moment, complete agreement cannot be achieved on  this drastic proposal, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government must  press   for  (1)  the  immediate reduction of the air  forces of  the  leading Powers to the level of  those of  the United Kingdom; (2) a  cut of 33   per cent, all round on the air forces of the world thus reduced,  British included&quot;;  (3)&quot;a&quot; limitation of the unladen weight  of military
aircraft to G50 kilogrammes&quot; (about two-thirds of a ton).  The adoption of theselimits would be followed by a thorough examination of the possibility of thecomplete abolition of military  and naval aircraft,  combined with effective inter-national regulation of civil aviation; in the meantime,  the prohibition of navaland military aircraft to Germany ought to continue.                       (B) Quantitative Disarmament.     The question of quantitative disarmament is one which will require long and detailed negotiation and on this point it is obviously impossible to give Germanyfurther satisfaction than what is already suggested of admitting in principle herclaim  to  equality  of  treatment and  freedom  to  readjust her fighting  forcesprovided  that readjustment is carried out in such a way as not to conflict withthe  jirinciple of limitation and reduction  of armaments.   That  is to say,  if germany  wishes, for instance, to be free from the prohibition against compulsory military service at  present incumbent on her, the numbers of men annually andcompulsorily given a militia training in Germany must be deducted, at a ratioto be  agreed on, from the numbers of her long-service troops.   Again, thereduction of the term  of service of these long-service  troops, from twelve to six years,  if agreed to, would be conditional on the number of long-service reservesnot being augmented; i.e., in that case, the number of  long-service troops withthe colours must then be reduced from 100,000 to 50,000.  Elaborate calculationsas to the proper ratios would be required, but  the guiding principle must remain,that is to say, reorganisation of the German forces must not involve increase ofGermany&apos;s powers of military aggression or increase of  her military budget.     We are favourably impressed by the Hoover proposals in regard to militaryeffectives and are prepared to accept them in principle as constituting a basis fordiscussion.  It is, however, unnecessary to enter into this matter at present withthe German Government since the whole question of  quantitative disarmament and  the proper ratios to be established between Germany&apos;s present forces,  or herreorganised forces,  and those of other countries would have to be dealt with (as.the German note admits) in detail at Geneva.* Aii exception would be needed for a limited number of troop-carriers and sea-planes.
