The New Forest and the Electricity Grid.           Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.                A question has arisen in connection with  the       construction or the electricity &quot;grid&quot; between Southampton and       Bournemouth.   On the direct route between these two  places       lies the New Forest, and the Board applied to the  Forestry       Commission, as the owners of the New Forest, and the  Court of       Verderers of the New Forest, as occupiers of the land over       which the proposed line would pass, for a wayleave to cross       the extreme north west corner of the Forest.   The Forestry       Commissioners having Indicated that they could not see their       v:&amp;y to grant the wayleave, the Board applied to me, under       Section 22 of the Electricity (Supply) Act,  1919*  to  grant a       compulsory wayleave.                The Forestry Commissioners, who are concerned only       with the Forest itself, take the view that the preservation of       the Forest in its natural and unspoiled state is a matter of  ....  national importance, for the reasons given in a memorandum       which is forwarded with this memorandum.                The line forms part of the main transmission system       of the South Y.&apos;est England scheme, the greater part of which is       already under construction.   Some way through has to be       secured for this line which, I am advised, it would not  be       feasible to place underground.   The question to be decided is       what is the most appropriate route taking into consideration       both the preservation of amenities in the district as a whole       and the cost.                As regards relative expenditure, the Central       Electricity Board estimate the cost of the grid line  along the       proposed route acrot-s the Forest at  7,150.    One  alternative
                        - 2 -route would entail an additional expenditure  of at  least 6,000 apart from any additional compensation which might hepayable for loss of amenity, and the other, although involvingless interference with gardens and residential amenities, anadditional expenditure of  1^*000.    In the circumstances,  Ido not think that the decision should he based on theconsideration of cost, in spite of the pressing need for economy.   Preponderant weight should he given to thepreservation of amenities.         The route proposed would cross the  extreme north westcorner of the area included in the Forest,  for a distance ofapproximately 2f miles, for much of which it  would only be just within the Forest boundaries.         The only other practicable routes, while remainingoutside the actual boundaries oi the Forest,  pass throughattractive woodland and then run for three miles down the AvonValley.         Before any decision could be given on the applicationfor the erection of an overhead line and for  the requisitewayleaves, it was necessary for me, in accordance with theprocedure under the Electricity (Supply) Acts, to consider  any representations from the local authorities and to hear any objections from the Verderers as occupiers;   and accordinglyon the 22nd September an Inquiry was held at  Winchester by  anofficer of my Department who had previously visited the areas concerned with representatives of the Commission and the Board.At this Inquiry the County Council of Southampton,  through  theChairman of the Town Planning Committee, stated that they considered that the amenities of the country  would be damagedto a much greater extent by either of the routes around thenorth of the Forest than by the route cutting through thenorth west corner of the Forest.   The Rural  District council had intimated their approval of the Board&apos;s proposed route  and
did not appear.    The Verderers,  as occupiers, wrote  to  theeffect that they strongly supported the Forestry Commissionand did not propose to te represented at the Inquiry.    TheHew Forest Association and the New Fprest Commoners DefenceAssociation uad asked leave to appear and were  given  theopportunity.   Their spokesman put forward the  case of theAssociation which was that the Nev/ Forest must  be preservedfrom any encroachment of the nature proposed irrespective ofthe effect elsewhere.   The officer who held the Inquiryreported that he agreed with the local authorities that  a gridline alonu, either of these other routes would interfere  to agreater extent with the amenities of the countryside.    he considers that the route across the corner of the Forest hasbeen designed to take advantage of the contours and othernatural features which lend themselves to concealment, andthat the interference with the Forest and the Forest  viewsv/ill not be conspicuous.         This conclusion is in accordance with the opinion!ofSir Reginald Blomfield who is retained by the Board to advisethem in connection with question relating to amenities.    I attach (Appendix A) a summary of his views.         It would appear on the facts before me that  the routeproposed by the Board is the less injurious to the amenities of the district.   It would be difficult to defend either ofthe alternative routes which pass for three miles down theAvon Valley, and also would involve a serious amount  of  treecutting, wnich Is not required on the route through the forest.         For the reasons previously stated a route must befound for the erection of this transmission line.  Sverypossible route has been surveyed and three alternatives havebeen put forward as practicable.   Of these one crosses theNew Forest, the others traverse the neighbouring country just
9*4 X X                         - k -outside the &quot;boundary.   The route through the Forest would,  inthe opinion of Sir Reginald Blomfield,  he much less conspicuousand do much less damage to the amenity of the part of Englandconcerned, and this view is supported &quot;by the local authorities who have considered both alternatives;   on the other hand,  theVerderers and Associations connected with the New Forest  objectto any line within the boundaries of the Forest in order  tomaintain the principle that the Forest should be preseredintact as a National sanctuary without reference to theimmediate effect on amenities which might be caused bydiverting the line.         I must ask the Cabinet to decide where the balance  ofpublic interest lies and whether or not in all thecircumstances the proposals of the Central Electricity board should be acceded to.

   THE NEW FOREST AND THE ELECTRICITY GRID.(Memoj. prepared by the Forestry Commissioners).         The New Forest is an object sui generis  so  far as great Britain is concerned and the only area which has anypretence to being a National Park.         The total area under the charge of the ForestryCommissioners is about 65*000 acres, of which about 42,000acres are commonable waste and 23,000 acres enclosed and openwoodlands.   It is the least changed of all the ancient RoyalForests and still retains some medieval features,  for example,in its Court of Verderers.   The preservation of  the amenities of the Forest have been given special legislative sanction  inthe New Forest Act of 1877* which limits the user of the soiland woodlands.   wince that time public sentiment has grown infavour of special treatment,  the New Forest Association, orepresentative body with some 1,200 members, has  been speciallyactive in that direction.         In 1927 the Commissioners, in the face of           Ccriticism (on aesthetic grounds) of the management of the forest, set up an Advisory Committee which they have founduseful and friendly^ and now systematically consult on questions                                                                Iof emenity.   On the Committee are representatives of bothlocal and national interests, viz,                                                      .         The Court of Verderers.         The New Forest Association.         The Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation                      Society.         The National Trust for places of Historic Interest                      and Natural Beauty.Attitude of the Commiesioners towards the Grid.         As far as the properties under their charge are

As a result the Commissionersdecided to oppose the passage of the Grid through the Forest.This deoision was announced on 2nd June, 1931, and re-affirmedto the New Forest Association on 4th September, 1931.Summary.         The Forestry Commissioners oppose the proposalto take the Grid line through the New Forest on tho ground thatit will introduce into that area, unique in itself and situatedwithin a hundred miles of London, an element of industrialisationwhich is quite out of place and contrary to the general spiritunderlying the Commissioners&apos; management of the Forest.         Finally it is to be noted that whereas the assessment of amenity values is mainly a matter of opinion, the Forest ispublic property and the neighbouring lands are private property.   The former can be continuously maintained In itspresent state by simple administrative action;  the latter willbe subject in the future to all the uncertainties attaching tothe development of lands in private ownership.generally concerned, the Commissioners have willinglyprovided wayleaves for electricity undertakings.    Thefollowing are a few examples
                     APPENDIX  A.Summary of and extracts from Sir Reginald Blomfield1s Report.         Sir Reginald reports  that he  can  find  no  reasonableobjection to the  proposed line through the Forest  which passes  overopen ground in the  north-west  corner of the New Forest  area.    this route is, he reports,            &quot;for  the  greater part, in  low  ground,  and most  of the         way, the line would be invisible  from  the main road.    There         are no trees to be  removed.    The line would have  a background         of hillside,  and where it climbs  the higher  ground on  the         east side  of Jacob&apos;s  Barrow,  the  towers would, to  a great         extent,  be lost in  the irregular  silhouette  of low Scotch         firs along the horizon.   There are no forest  trees along         the whole  length of the line.   It is  open ground  all  the         way, almost  moorland, just the bare open  country in which         the towers would, in  fact, give an added  interest  to the         landscape  and make  their own  appeal to the imagination.&quot;         Sir Reginald reports  as follows with regard  to thatone of the two alternative routes which, is, in his opinion, the less objectionable on  the  score of  interference with amenities:-            &quot;There  is, however, a much more grave  objection to  this         line on  the  ground  of amenities.   To  the south of Wood Green         the ground rises steeply about 150 feet,  forming a terrace         some f mile  long, and extending from Wood Green to Fold         Farm, marked on the map as Castle Hill.    A  new Forest track         runs along the top  with a very extensive  view  of the Avon         Valley,  looking north, south  and  west.   Line  C running north         and south  would cross the low ground about half way between         Breamore Hill and this terrace, and would undoubtedly         introduce  an incongruous element  into  this characteristic         and very beautiful  English landscape of  the  Avon winding its         way among  wide grass  fields  through a  broad  and well wooded         valley bounded by the low hills to  the west.   As  seen
         from the terrace there Is nothing that interferes         with the paBtoral character of the landscape.   In         my opinion the view should be preserved just as it         is without any alteration.   It is of peculiar value,         among other reasons, because It is in its way unique         in New Forest scenery.&quot;         Sir Reginald^ general conclusion on the whole matter is thet while no injury is done to the Forest by the proposedline through it, If either of the two possible alternatives is adopted Mtho public will lose some beautiful characteristicEnglish landscape which is at present quite unspoilt.&quot;
