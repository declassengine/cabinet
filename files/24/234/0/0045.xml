THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government confidential.EFFORT ON THE  WORK OF THE PREPARATORY  COMMITTEE FOR               THE WORLD ECONOMIC CONFERENCE.    WE beg to submit  a report  on the recent  meeting of the preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference.    1.   The  Meeting  took place  at  Geneva9th November.

(Above nominated by League          of Nations.)    The proceedings opened with a joint meeting of the full Committee, at whichlittle  but formal business  was transacted.  It was agreed that in accordancewith  the Resolution of the Council  Organising Committee the representativesof  the  International  Labour  Office and of  the  International  Institute  ofAgriculture should be invited to attend the meetings of either Sub-Committeein so  far as they were interested.  Sir F. Leith-Ross raised the question as towhether the International Chamber of Commerce  should not  also be  invitedto assist in the work of the Preparatory Committee.  After  some discussion, itwas agreed that the International Chamber of Commerce should be  invited tosubmit their views, in the first instance, in writing, but that they should be given  an  opportunity thereafter of explaining these views orally,  if they so  desired.    It was then decided that the two Sub-Committees should at once proceed tomeet  separately.  This procedure proved unfortunate.  One constant difficulty was the eagerness of many of the foreign representatives  to  get away from geneva as quickly as possible.  Moreover,  the rigid separation of the Economicand Monetary  Sub-Committees was  in  our view a mistake.   There was onlyone joint Session of the two Sub-Committees, and that arranged with considerabledifficulty, at which any real interchange of views took place on the economic and monetary problems raised as a whole.* M. Prebisch did not, in fact, attend.6599  [7843]
     When Delegates, expert advisers of all kinds, representatives of the Inter- national  Labour  Office and  the  International  Institute of  Agriculture, the secretariat supplied by the League of Nations and officials of the Bank of Inter- national  Settlements, were allowed  for there  were sometimes  over  a  hundred persons present at a meeting.    This is not an atmosphere in which important financial  or economic discussions are most easily  conducted, nor is it surprising that although the meetings were private, long and  fairly accurate  accounts of certain important discussions appeared  in various Swiss newspapers.                 Proceedings of the  Monetary Sub-Committee.     &apos;2.  It is  almost impossible to present any short summary of these discussions which occupied twelve meetings, and ranged over  a wide field.   An aide-memoire of discussions, not for publication, was  prepared and is attached (Appendix 1), but this is a somewhat indefinite document owing  to the wide divergence of views on several important topics.     The great majority of the members  of the Sub-Committee  are from countries on the  gold standard, and there is a preponderance of  banking representatives. Apart  from one or two interventions by the  Japanese representative, the whole case for countries now off the gold standard fell on the  British representative. The Finn, Dr. Ryti,  made it clear that  he was personally in favour of the gold standard  and  ready to go back immediately he could obtain the necessary resources. The Norwegian representative was ill and contributed nothing to the discussion. He is chairman of the Norwegian Currency  Committee and his personal  views are similar  to those of Dr. Ryti.     The views expressed on behalf of the gold countries, including Germany and other countries clinging precariously to  the gold standard by the use of  artificial means  such as exchange controls, were  as follows.   The  worst developments of the existing obstacles to  world trade, whether they take the  form of excessive tariff barriers, quota systems, exchange  controls, clearing  arrangements, etc., are subsequent in date to Great Britain&apos;s departure from the gold standard, and in very large measure the direct consequences of a fluctuating  sterling exchange. For these countries the one essential preliminary to recovery is the return of Great Britain to the gold standard.   They do not expect us,  of course, to go back to gold at the old par, but desire us to adopt some fixed gold parity and thereafter to maintain it if the necessity arises, by deflating our own costs.   They are entirely sceptical of monetary policy having any  effect on prices.     The reply given to these  suggestions was founded on the  basis of the policy announced  at Ottawa, the suggestion  that  Great  Britain ought  to resort  to further deflation, giving,  of course,  a suitable opening.  We are not prepared to dispute, that an  international standard is desirable and that only  the gold standard  has much  chance of  world-wide acceptance.  But there  can be no question of our return to gold until we  are satisfied that  economic conditions at home and abroad  permit the adoption of that course and the essential conditions are those concerned with freer trade  and a higher price level.   In the meantime, what the world requires above  all is a  sharp reversal  of  the  present downward trend of wholesale prices.   More particularly, a recovery  in the wholesale prices of raw materials  and food-stuffs is essential before  countries producing primary products  can  resume healthy trade relations with the rest of the world.     As regards the methods of producing a rise in prices, the remedies required are partly political, partly economic (e.g., the restoration of freedom of movement of goods and  services) and partly monetary.  The monetary factors involved are the maintenance of the present cheap money policy in the chief creditor countries and some positive action on the part of those creditor countries which possess a great surplus of gold reserves and utilisable assets.   These reserves, instead of being  maintained in a sterilised  condition, should be allowed to have their normal effects on  the internal price  levels  of the countries concerned.  With a&apos;&apos; freer admission of goods  from other countries those effects would  very rapidly be spread over the world.     .3.  The  following  notes  will indicate  the  position taken by individual Delegates :      Dr. Trip, the President of  the Netherlands  Bank, who acted as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, is by far the ablest advocate  of the views of the gold standard  countries as set out above.  As regards the necessity of freeing trade
or) r*from restriction, he is perfectly sound, but persists in the view that the essentialfirst step is a return of England to gold.   He is in sympathy with the programmeof minor reforms recommended in the report of the Gold Delegation, including areduction in the minimum legal reserve  ratios of Central Banks. He is entirely in agreement with  the view that gold  reserves are required against  liabilitiesabroad and not against liabilities at home.  He even indicated, subject to variousconditions and restrictions,  how he envisaged a reduction in the excessive gold reserves now held by Holland.    Mr.  Fraser is an American lawyer, who is  Vice-President  of the Bank  for international Settlements and is constantly seeking the further development ofthat institution.  He holds substantially the  same  views  as Dr.  Trip,  andexpresses them with considerable ability.    Mr.  Williams is a Professor of  Economics at Harvard  University.  He isunder no illusions as to  the real cause  of the breakdown  of the gold standard,viz., that since the war there has been no centre, such as London used to be beforethe war, in which  debtor countries  can be  certain of  disposing of their goods and of obtaining temporary financial assistance if required.    For  the rest his views are not helpful.   He admits the existence of most ofthe dangers that we foresee in the present situation, but holds that they must bemet not  by raising prices, but by a deliberate cutting down  everywhere of debtobligations.  He agrees that the interests of Great Britain are largely concernedwith those of the countries producing primary commodities.  He agrees also thatwe have  to settle on a new parity at such a rate as suits our  own conditions,  buthe supports the continental view that the fall in sterling has contributed to thefall in gold prices.   Generally, he thinks that in fact nothing useful can be doneuntil Great Britain is ready to return to the gold standard.  On the question ofgold reserves  he produced  a peculiarly American view which insists that  themaintenance of vast reserves by the  Federal Reserve  Banks is  a necessaryprecaution on account of the tendency of American Commercial Banks to overlend.This evades the point at issue, which is not whether  the Central Bank should maintain large  reserves,  but whether those reserves need take the form  of gold.On this as on several other jDoints he met opposing views by saying that whateverhe thought as an economist  he did not think it practicable to secure any furtheralteration  in  American currency laws.   He  had one passage of arms withMr. Fraser, in which he indicated fairly sharply that direct participation of theFederal  Reserve   Board  in the  Bank for  International  Settlements  was impracticable.   He emphasised that questions such as the return to gold of  any country can best be settled between Central Banks rather than through the inter-intermediary of the Bank for International Settlements.    M. Rist,  the French representative, is a well-known publicist and the mosteminent of French economists; he has been connected at various times with theBank of France. On questions of trade  policy, he approaches somewhat the free trade point of  view.   Flis monetary views are unfortunately of  a  peculiarlyunbending character. He has no belief  whatever in the success of a cheap-moneypolicy in raising prices and for him the question  of a  rise in prices is the same thing as ending the crisis. When the world crisis ends, however it ends, prices will rise.  Prices are merely a thermometer  indicating the health or sickness of theeconomic system.   He appears to be opposed even to the very moderate reformssuggested by the Gold Delegation, and,  naturally,  would be still more opposed toany extension of these reforms.     Signor Beneduce, a former Italian Minister, who is now the head of a bankingsyndicate,  acted as President of the  Monetary Sub-Committee and,  for the mostpart, confined his expression of views to generalities.  He is, however, clearly asupporter  of Dr. Trip on the question of Great  Britain&apos;s return to gold.     Mr. Tsushima, the Japanese representative, made  one quite short but usefulspeech on the subject of gold reserves.   For the rest he indicated the willingness of Japan to return to gold on suitable conditions, which he did not specify.   (He is a somewhat dangerous ally, as it is mainly the use by Japan of a depreciatedcurrency to undercut prices which is stirring up opinion in the United States for action against countries off the gold standard.)

    Herr Voclce is a Direktor of the Reichsbank.  His views are substantially inaccordance with those of Dr. Trip.   He was persistent that Germany could notrelax  restrictions on trade  or  the  control of foreign exchange dealings untilEngland went back to gold.   His special point was to urge that the Standstillarrangements ought to  be  considered by  the World Economic  Conference.  Itwould, however, be clearly impossible for the World Economic Conference or any committee attached to that Conference to intervene in the matter until an attempthas been made by debtors and creditors to reach further agreement.    Of the other Delegates, M. Francqui, the Belgian Banker  and ex-Minister,resolutely refused to speak on any subject.   Although his  views  are known to bemuch more closely in accord with ours than with those of the other members ofthe Committee, he thought it premature to give expression  to them at this stage.    M. J.  Musy, a member of the Swiss Federal Government,  made one strongspeech in which he urged the necessity for a rise in prices if  Switzerland wasnot to be forced off gold.  It was rumoured that he was severely reprimanded forthis by his Government, and  at  a  later meeting he delivered  a further speech on  the unity of all Swiss citizens  in demanding the. maintenance of the  goldstandard.    The Pole,  M. Baranski, and  the Finn, Dr. Ryti, made several  speeches, butsubstantially both were in agreement with the views of Dr. Trip.    4.  Numerous  subordinate  topics  were discussed.   No   member  of theCommittee appeared to  take  the question of bimetallism very seriously.   Thequestion of revalorising silver was mentioned  by the  United States member asa matter of duty.  In private  conversation he  indicated that he did not believethat any action in  this  sense was possible or even desirable.  On the matter ofexchange restrictions it was insisted by  the gold  countries that nothing  couldwel I be done until sterling was stabilised.   Otherwise the  general view expressedwas that it wras desirable to loosen exchange restrictions  gradually even if theyhad to be maintained for a time with regard to  capital movements, and  evenif it were necessary to abandon existing parities.  The example of Austria whichhas successfully  restored a reasonable freedom of exchange at a  lower  paritywithout a  collapse  is having a good effect, and the fact that the French agreed on this point  shows a considerable advance  on the position  they took up a fewmonths ago.     Considerable discussion took place on the gold exchange standard, i.e., thesystem by which smaller countries keep  their reserves largely in the form offoreign  exchange as a substitute for gold.   This system  has fallen into intensedisrepute on the Continent as a  result of the losses imposed on certain central banks by the departure of Great Britain  from the Gold Standard.  The general view of the Sub-Committee was that the system responded, nevertheless, to a realnecessity of the smaller countries and in some form or other would necessarily have to  be revived.                Proceedings of the Economic Sub-Committee.    5.  The Economic Sub-Committee held fourteen  meetings, during which itreviewed the principal questions of commercial policy.   An  aide-memoire, not for publication, resuming these discussions, was prepared by the Committee andis attached.    While everyone admitted  the  desirability of  a  relaxation of the presentbarriers to trade, the discussions disclosed the difficulties in the wTay of progressrather than suggested  their solution.   At every stage of the discussions  therewas a marked tendency on the part of the representatives of  the gold standardcountries to suggest that economic  action must wait  on monetary and financialrehabilitation.   As the Financial Sub-Committee had in various passages of itsreport put forward the contrary proposition, there was an evident risk that (as one member expressed it) the work of the two Sub-Committees might resolve itselfinto a mere game of tennis between the two.    The argument that monetary and financial recovery must precede economicaction had obvious dangers from our point of  view, as it tended to support the
pressure  for the stabilisation of sterling, as the first step to  the restoration ofthe situation, which had also featured so prominently in the  discussions of theFinancial Sub-Committee.   Accordingly, the British  Delegation,  supportedgenerally by the Germans, took all appropriate opportunities  to emphasise thatone of the cardinal factors in the crisis is, in His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s view,of a predominantly economic character,  viz., that the creditor countries of thepresent day have, in contrast to the policy pursued by London, refused either  to lend consistently or  to admit the goods of the debtor countries, with the resultthat these last, after being drained of their  gold,  are left without  the means  topay their debts.  Accordingly, excessive protectionism,  and particularly that  ofthe creditor countries, must be abated before progress could be looked for towards a general financial and economic recovery.  This point of view, strongly supportedby Dr. Trip (the Chairman of the Joint Committee) was not seriously contestedby any of the other Delegates, and it will be seen that,  in general  terms, it hasfound expression to some degree  in the Aide-Memoire of the Economic  Sub-Committee.   The majority of the Sub-Committee, however, still maintained thatactioh on the monetary and financial side and on the economic side must be  atleast simultaneous.     &amp;.  Prohibitions,  Qitotas  and  Similar Restrictions. The  necessity  offinancial improvement as a condition of economic progress was pleaded with mostjustification in regard  to the  abolition  of  the restrictions on  trade,  such  asprohibitions, quotas, exchange controls  and clearing arrangements, which wasthe first subject  discussed.  The  argument was  advanced from  two  differentaspects.  The  German member, supported by the representatives of  the smallerStates of Eastern  Europe, pleaded that it was quite impossible  to abandon thepresent restrictions unless  their  exchange  difficulties were  first  solved.  TheGerman, moreover, maintained  insistently that  his  Government could not participate in any action to remove restrictions of this kind unless simultaneousaction was taken to reduce tariffs.  On the other hand, the French representativesargued that, owing to the differences in price levels, they could not admit theinflux of goods from the bankrupt countries of Europe without complete disasterto  many of  their industries.   The American  Delegation on  some  occasionsappeared inclined to support the French view, and  asked that special  reference should be made to the competitive effect of depreciated exchanges.  They indicated that their statement referred primarily to the competition of Japanese goods, but its terms applied  to all countries with  depreciated exchanges,  and  it  was only after private representations that  they agreed to omit it from the Aide  Memoire.     The general result  of the discussion on this topic was to  indicate that thereis no probability of the rapid and drastic abolition of these restrictions and thatthe best that can be hoped  for is a  gradual relaxation  of  their excesses, theprogress of which will largely depend on the rapidity with which the  present financial troubles of the world can be liquidated.     7.   Tariff Policy. As regards  tariff policy,  the view  was  expressed,  onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that the objective  must be  to mitigateexcessive tariffs, which had the effect of stimulating uneconomic production. TheGerman and Italian representatives supported this view,  and it was duly recorded in the  Aide-Memoire.    But  the  American representative  raised considerableobjections to this passage, and it was  only after much discussion  that it wasadopted.  The French representatives again emphasised the argument that theirtariff policy must be dependent on the re-establishment of a better equilibrium ofprices.  So far from agreeing to reduce their existing tariffs,  they indicated thattheir Government  would almost  certainly have to impose increases of tariffs,particularly if and in so far as quotas were abolished,  but they appeared to be working out some scheme for temporary additional surcharges which would meetthe present situation without becoming a permanent part of their tariff  system.     8.   Tariff Truce. The American member threw out the suggestion that atthe outset of the World Conference the  Governments might agree  to suspend all further  increases of tariffs  or other restrictions.   The  British  representativesupported this proposal,  and urged that it should,  if possible, be adopted by  thePreparatory Committee  and submitted  at once to the various Governments  fortheir adhesion, so as to ensure a calmer atmosphere for the Conference.   But thissuggestion was not entertained by the other members, who declared that it would
 be quite impossible  for  their  Governments  to  tie  their  hands  in present circumstances,  an  argument  which  might  also  appeal  to  His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  Further, it was pointed out with force that, unless such a proposal could  be carried out  at once,  its discussion  might lead many Governments to increase their tariffs beforehand, so as to be in a stronger position if and when a tariff truce were agreed to.  It was therefore decided not to initiate any proposal of this kind at the moment, but to record it in the Aide-Memoire, with  a view to bringing it up again if an occasion offered for securing its immediate acceptance. ,.   ,9.  -Boycotts. It  may be of interest to mention that, at  the end of the discussion on tariffs, the Japanese member asked that the question  of boycotts should., be placed on  the  agenda of the Conference.   The American member objected to this proposal on the ground that unofficial movements could not be dealt with by the Conference, but, after some discussion, he agreed that it-would be sufficient if his views were recorded in the minutes of the meetings.      8     10.  The Most-Favour eel-Nation  Clause. The Committee  then  discussed Treaty relations, with particular reference to the most-favoured-nation cjause. The British member did not intervene in this discussion till a late stage, in order to hear the views of the other representatives first.  The Germans, the Americans, the Italians and the Japanese  all stressed the importance that they attached to the acceptance and application of the most-favoured-nation clause in its widest and most unconditional form.  It wras agreed that great caution was required in considering  any derogations  from the clause, though  the  question was  of sufficient  importance  to  merit examination  at the  Conference.  There was practically  no  discussion   of the  Dutch-Belgian  Convention, which  was apparently regarded as dead even by the Belgians,  and the latter appeared now to be  more  interested in  special  agreements for  lower tariffs  on  particular commodities,  such as has been under discussion between the representatives of the Woollen  industries.   The Italians expressed  the view  that multilateralnegotiations would lead to no results, and that the only procedure likely  to secureprogress  was by means  of bilateral negotiations.    Such opposition as there  was to the most-favoured-nation clause may  besummarised as follows  :     (1) The French  objected that it gave the  high-.tariff countries much greater          advantages  than lowr-tariff countries, and argued in favour of  a greater          degree of reciprocity in commercial relations, though they showed no          desire to join in, or, indeed, to favour,  any low-tariff group.  Their          object seemed to be to &quot; deconsolidate &quot; their existing tariff rates, so as          to have full freedom to negotiate, on a reciprocal  basis, with  other          countries.    (2) The  Germans  objected to the  various methods of  evasion of most-          favoured-nation   obligations wdiich  were  being   practised,   and          criticised the extension  of  Imperial preferences resulting from  the          Ottawa Agreements, with particular reference to the British-Indian          agreement.  It was pointed out that this was a domestic matter, which          lay outside  the scope of the most-favoured-nation clause,  and  the          reference made to the subject in the Aide-Memoire was  in general          terms.    (3) Considerable discussion took place on the proposal adopted by the Stresa          Conference  for the grant of special and temporary preferences by. the          countries of Western  Europe to  the cereal-producing countries of          Eastern Europe.   The German and French&quot;, supported by  the Czech          and Hungarian members and (rather  more reservedly)  by the Italian,          urged the desirability of securing  the immediate  acceptance of  this          proposal.  Some  reference was again made in this  discussion to the          Ottawa agreements.   The British member took the line that while          His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared  to  consider the  proposal          sympathetically, it was a mere palliative, and that the agricultural          problem was a world-wide one which required for its solution a  more          economic  organisation of production.    He added  that the Ottawa          agreements  only involved a duty of 2s. a  quarter on wheat, and that          subject to this the United Kingdom offered a free market to cereals          from  all countries without any quota limitations on imports, and he
          argued that if the Western  European countries wanted to give          effective assistance to Eastern Europe, they should reduce their present          excessive protection on cereals.  The American representative (whose          Government have hitherto stood in the way of such cereal preferences)          gave general support to the British view.    11.  Producers&apos;   Agreements and  Minor  Questions. Apart from  these general questions,  the Economic Sub-Committee spent some time discussing thepossibility of securing international agreements in regard to  the production ormarketing of wheat, coal and timber and agreed that this question should be puton the agenda of the Conference, subject to a  further review of the situation atthe next session.   They also discussed the schemes for public works in eastern europe prepared  by the International Labour Office.  It was pointed out thatHis Majesty&apos;s  Government were not  prepared to finance such schemes, and  itwas suggested that they were not worth discussing unless their financial executioncould be assured.    The  Sub-Committee decided to send the proposal to theFinancial Sub-Committee, subject to this expression of view.  They also examinedsome-minor questions (e.g., Customs Nomenclature) and drew up a list of furthersubjects which  should be discussed at the next session.    It might have been useful to examine some of these questions more fully atthe present time, but the Financial Sub-Committee having completed its discussion it was felt advisable for the Economic  Sub-Committee to adjourn at the sametime as they did.                Joint Sessio?i of the Preparatory Committee.    12.  Accordingly, a joint session of the full Committee was held on Monday,the 7th November, at which the Chairmen of the  two Sub-Committees  reported the progress made, and a general discussion was opened as to the relations of theirrespective tasks.   At this discussion Sir F.  Leith-Ross  spoke at some length,urging the Committee to realise the importance  of finding practical solutionsbefore the next session, and not to  continue turning in a vicious circle.  Whilefully  agreeing  that steps must be taken to improve commercial relations and  to relax tariffs  and  other restrictions, he  argued strongly that action was  also required on  the monetary side to  stop the spiral of deflation in which the worldwas now caught and to improveftrfe level of  prices of primary commodities. Hesuggested that if there waVrigidity&apos;oh the economic side, there was at least equalrigidity on the monetary side1; and that every possible means should be consideredof making the monetary system better adapted to the requirements of the presentsituation, by legislation, if necessary, to give Central Banks  wider powers.   a record of this speech is attached  (Appendix  III).  Considering how unpalatablethese views were to the majority of  the Financial Sub-Committee, they seemed  tomake a certain impression and several subsequent speakers undertook to give thequestion fuller consideration.                             Further Procedure.    13.  The general results of the discussions may  appear disappointing.  Butat the present stage it was not to be expected that the Committee could do morethan  review  the principal - difficulties and ascertain the several standpoints  ofthe various Governments.  It will not be an easy matter to reconcile these stand-points, and even at the next session it may be  expected that wide differences willexist.  The  best and  perhaps the only  chance of  agreement will probably haveto be  found  in some co-ordinated scheme for action on monetary and commercial matters simultaneously.    It was agreed, subject to the decision of the Council Organising Committee,that the Preparatory  Committee should adjourn until  after Christmas.  TheAmerican members are returning to the United  States and  explained that  inview  of  the  political situation it would not be possible for  them to  continuefruitful  work  till they had had an  opportunity  of consulting  the authorities at home.  This involves necessarily a postponement  of the Conference for sometime,  as it is normal to give notice of the date of meeting and circulate documentstwelve weeks in advance of the meeting so as  to give the most distant countries,e.g., in South America, the opportunity to study the agenda and decide theirpolicy.   But it was emphasised on all  sides that it would be necessary in any
gcase to postpone the Conference until, at any rate, the spring of next year.  Itwas urged that a Conference called in present conditions would  be  doomed tofailure, and  such a failure the world could not afford.  Every effort must bemade  to prepare the ground and ensure  that agreement was possible before theGovernments met.  This view was stressed at least as strongly by the Americanas by  the  other Delegations, and from the technical point of view it is difficultto resist.   The report of the Prime Ministers  speech  in the House on the7th November only reached Geneva at the  conclusion of our sittings, and  greatapprehensions  were expressed as to  the dangers of convening the Conferencewithout much further preparation of  the ground.    During the interval between the two  sessions, it was agreed that the membersof the Preparatory Committee should keep in touch, through their  Chairman,and exchange ideas. Some of the French and Italian members of the Committeesuggested that after they had had an opportunity of  discussing the situation with  their Governments, they would like  to exchange views with  the british members and possibly  to have some informal joint meetings, either  in london or in  Paris, with a few of our colleagues  in order to work out positive proposals.We expressed willingness to join in such exchanges of view, though it is to be feared that  we shall  find  that  the  stabilisation  of sterling will  remain theprincipal, and  at present the immovable  obstacle to any understanding.

In  conclusion,  it may be  mentioned  that  despite  freely  expresseddifferences of opinion  the relations between  us and the other  Delegations werethroughout excellent, and the atmosphere in both Sub-Committees was extremelyfriendly.    We took special care to cultivate good relations with  the American repre-sentatives.  This was  easy, as they responded readily to  friendly  approaches.They  are both University professors and they made it clear from the outset thatthey  were speaking as experts and that their remarks  could not be  taken asengaging  their Government in any wray.  Mr. Day (who is a Democrat) on many occasions  indicated that he agreed, personally, to propositions put forward, e.g.,as to  the  necessity of  tariff revisions on  the  part of creditor countries, but felt it necessary to insist that any reference made [to them should be in very guardedterms.  Similarly,  Mr. Williams had no hesitation in  agreeing that war debtsshould be cancelled, but, of course, would not accept any reference to the subject in the Aide-Memoire of- his Sub-Committee.   In private  conversations with theAmerican Delegation the view was expressed that both at the December sessionof Congress,  and at the earlier stages of  the new Congress, there would be strong pressure  for  higher protection.  They  anticipated that legislation  would be promoted in December  for the application of countervailing  duties  againstdepreciated  exchanges,  though on the  whole it  seemed  improbable  that suciilegislation would get  through that  session.   There was, however, considerableprobability of  such legislation passing in  the  next Congress, and it wras partly as a check on this tendency that Mr. Day had advocated a tariff truce.  He thoughtthat certain factors wrere working towards a  modification  of United  States tariff policy (especially the growing recognition  of the export interests of  the UnitedStates of  America), but he did not encourage hopes of early action in this sense,even  from a Democratic Congress.   On monetary questions both  Americanmembers  constantly referred to the  stabilisation of sterling  as an  essential condition of success of  the  World  Conference,  though they  appreciated  thedifficulties that faced  us in that matter.

9 rJ ok, 6 O     AIDE-MEMOIRE ON WORK OF THE FINANCIAL SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE                          PREPARATORY COMMITTEE.                     &apos;    THE discussions which took place were of an exploratory character intendedto bring out the major questions which might fall to be dealt with by the Economicand  Monetary Conference.   The members thought that at this stage  it  was preferable  to confine their discussions  to a preliminary exchange of views.  . TheSub-Committee considered the various subjects  indicated in the report of the lausanne Conference:              (a) Monetary and  credit policy.             (b) Price movements.             (c) Exchange difficulties.             (d) Movement of capital.                       I. Monetary and Credit Policy.    The Sub-Committee devoted their main  attention to the conditions underwhich an orderly return to a  common international standard might  be possible,and they were unable to see  a  standard  other  than one based on  gold, whichwould be universally acceptable. As indicated in the final  Report of  the  GoldDelegation, the time and level as well as the particular form of restoration ofthe gold standard should that be decided  upon can be determined  only by theproper authorities in the countries  concerned.   This decision must necessarily depend on the economic  conditions both in their own country and abroad.  It waspointed out in the course of the discussion that some essential conditions  need be fulfilled to permit any early return to a free gold standard :     (a)  Re-establishment of a greater  degree of confidence to which the solutionof certain outstanding political problems would greatly contribute.    (b)  Measures to enable the mechanism of the balance of payments to function in a more satisfactory manner and thus to create in  countries whose reserves areat present  inadequate the possibility  of  attaining  a more  satisfactory reserveposition  involving :      (i) A satisfactory  settlement of intergovernmental debt  questions  was           necessary, but it was  recognised that  these questions fall outside the           purview of this Sub-Committee.     (ii) A return to a reasonable degree of freedom in the movement of goods           and services.    (lii) A return to a  reasonable degree of freedom in the movement of capital           which would inter alia presuppose the solution of various problems of           excessive  indebtedness especially at short term  (liquidation  of the           past).    (iv)  A  reduction  of the dangers presented by the present large  volume and           sudden movements  of  short-term capital.     (v) The adoption of appropriate parities of exchange by countries returning           to the gold standard.    (c)  A  general understanding about measures to be taken to ensure a betterworking of  the gold standard  in the future (see below).    (d) In  addition to these  measures of a more international character  each individual  country should take  the  necessary steps in regard to the following-matters :      (i) Revenue and expenditure not only of the State budget proper, but also           of the budgets of  public enterprises  (railways,  &amp;c)  and  local           authorities to be balanced.     (ii) It is also necessary to allow the movements of gold  and credit policy to           have their required effects and  in general to give sufficient flexibility           to the economic system.    (iii) Finally, it will be necessary to create and  maintain healthy conditions           in the internal money and  capital markets.
    The Sub-Committee  also  discussed  to  what  extent  actual  tendencies of wholesale and other prices would play a role in influencing the re-establishment ofthe gold standard.  (This subject is referred to in greater  detail in Part TIbelow.)    It was pointed out that certain nations were in a key position in that their action would have a determinant influence on the general monetary development.    The following particular questions were referred to in the discussion :     (a)  Independence of central banks from political influence.    (b)  Collaboration of central banks inter se and the &quot;role of the B.I.S. in that          respect.    (c)  Collaboration between  the B.I.S. and the Financial Organisation of the          League of Nations.    The report of  the Committee appointed to examine the question  of  thenormalisation fund  raised by  the  Stresa  Conference was communicated to theSub-Committee.  The  Sub-Committee also dealt with the general problem of central bank credits (seasonal credits, revolving credits and emergency credits) inconnection with a return to the gold standard and the limited effects which couldbe expected  from such credits, and the conditions which had to be fulfilled before they could be granted.Question relating to a Better Working of the Gold Standard  in Future.    It was proposed that the final report of the Gold Delegation should be taken as a basis for the discussion, and reference was made to the fact that the Boardof the B.I.S. had found itself in substantial agreement with the general principlesof monetary policy contained in that report.    (a) The Gold Exchange Standard. It  was assumed  that certain countries will continue to employ the standard, and the opinion was also expressed thatthe Central  Banks of most countries, even when the gold exchange standard is not formally adopted,  will find it useful to supplement their  gold reserves  withholdings of  foreign  exchange.  It was emphasised that certain reforms must beintroduced  in the working  of  the gold exchange standard  in  the  light of theexperience of recent years.  Reference was, in particular, made to the need of concentrating foreign exchange reserves with Central Banks, either directly or through the intermediary of the B.I.S.    (b) Minimum Legal Ratios. In the course of the discussion the opinion was expressed that apart from other considerations it would be useful from a practical point of view if legal ratios were fixed at a lower level in order to enable various countries to return more speedily to the gold standard.  The Sub-committee considered in this connection  the arguments in favour  of more flexible coverprovisions, which would allow gold holdings to be more readily  available as areserve  for  foreign payments.   It also discussed  the dangers of inflationarytendencies should the standard become less restrictive.    (c)  The Sub-Committee also discussed the problem of the present  abnormaldistribution  of  gold   reserves  and  that  of  employing  these  reserves  for strengthening the credit structure of the world.    Silver. The question of silver was raised for discussion, and it was agreedto consider the subject further  at a later meeting of the Committee.                           II.-Price Movements.    The Sub-Committee  considered  the  question whether (or  to  what extent)monetary action could have  an  influence on the general level of prices in presentcircumstances.   It recognised that a rise in world wholesale prices, if it occurred,would facilitate the re-establishment of the gold standard.  Emphasis was laid on the influence of other  factors than those which the Central Banks  alone are able to affect.    It was pointed out that the Object of the Economic and Monetary conference was to.assist in the removal of those conditions which made  for a prolongation of the depression.   To the extent that  the  work was  successful and a  traderecovery set in, it could be expected that a rise in wholesale prices would ensue.    It was  also pointed  out that  the main  credit  markets were characterisedby conditions of cheap  short-term money rates, and the resources of their private
banks were generally considerable.  If through a return  of  confidence or  aremoval of trade barriers the movement of goods were to increase, the presentcredit situation would facilitate a rise of prices.                        III. Exchange Restrictions.    The Committee examined the effects of  foreign  exchange control  both on^the general situation and on prices, exchange rates, &amp;c, in  the countries whichhad introduced such control in order (i) to prevent flight of capital;  (ii) to keepthe repayment of foreign debts within the limits of available exchange resources;and/or (iii) to improve their balance of trade by restricting imports.    The danger of exchange control creating a disequilibrium between  internal and external prices in certain cases, and the desirability of doing away  withcontrols was  emphasised.   In the course  of the discussion the conditions which for some  countries  should be  fulfilled  to make such a removal possible  were stated to be     (a)  Measures against  a sudden withdrawal  of  short-term  foreign credits           and,  in certain cases, a modification of the present standstill arrange-           ments.  Possibly  also, in certain cases, arrangements in  respect of           long-term indebtedness when the burden of that  indebtedness proved           clearly excessive at existing price levels.    (b)  A greater  freedom in the movement of goods,  so that  export  markets           were rendered available and the proper economic foundation laid for           commercial credit operations.    (c)  Abolition of any system by which the foreign exchange countries obtain           from exports is blocked abroad.    The opinion was expressed that there should at  least be a relative  de  factostabilisation  of  currencies, the  fluctuations of  which  were bound  to  have aconsiderable  influence on the balance of payments of other countries.    Stress was  laid on the importance  of negotiations being undertaken  witha view to arriving at new short-term debt arrangements,  and thus  to replacing the present system of standstill  arrangements, which involved  the dangers of placing good and bad debtors on the same footing  and  tended to destroy the credit position also of the former.    As regards settlements of excessive long-term indebtedness, a suggestion wasmade that a panel of persons of outstanding authority and competence might beappointed, who  might be invited by creditors and debtors to act as conciliatorsshould they fail to reach agreement by direct negotiation,  which is the appropriate method.    The attention  of  the  Sub-Committee was  drawn  to  the  desirability ofloosening  the exchange restrictions in  the  first instance  for  satisfying therequirements of  foreign trade, even where it was necessary to maintain them withregard to capital movements or in certain cases to abandon existing parities.                          IV. Capital Movements.    In addition to the questions dealt with under III above, the Sub-Committeediscussed in general  the  question of stagnation of capital movements  and thedifficulties of restoring the confidence of investors in foreign lending.    Emphasis was laid on the  need for creditor countries to  permit  debtors tomeet their debts in goods and services, and also on the importance of allowingcajsital exports to have their  natural effect on the movements of gold.  reference was also made in this connection to the  influence  of capital movements on thedistribution of gold.    Certain technical questions were  raised in the course of  the discussion :      (a)  The need of  more complete information in the hands of the monetary           authorities regarding movements,  particularly  of short-term capital.    (b)  The possibility of ensuring full information available to the market in the           issue of prospectus of loans, &amp;c.
                             V. Public  Works.     The Sub-Committee decided that this question should be examined before its next  session by certain of its members, together with  representatives of theInternational Labour Organisation and of the Technical Committee of the TransitOrganisation, who have been dealing with this subject.                               VI. General.     Throughout  the discussions emphasis was  laid on  the  close relationship between the processes of financial and of economic restoration, and oh the need for greater freedom in the movement of goods.  Any plan for the general improvementof the economic  situation must, it was felt, cover at once and coherently theeconomic and the financial fields.    Any such plan will, however, depend for its success on the prior settlement ofcertain outstanding  political problems, which fall outside the purview of thisCommittee.    The Sub-Committee requested the President of the Preparatory Committee toarrange for continued work on such questions as he might  determine, includingthe study mentioned in Section V above.APPENDIX  II.     AIDE-MEMOIHE  ON  THE  WORK OF  THE ECONOMIC  SUB-COMMITTEE.     IN  the course  of its discussions,  the Sub-Committee directed its. chiefattention to the problems which are immediately linked with the depression andfor which the International Conference might find a solution.   Its examinationwas essentially a preliminary  one and was limited to a few fundamental  points.It was  conducted with the object of bringing out the main trends of economic policy at the present time, and the factors upon which must depend any improve-ment of  international trade, the course  of  which  has  shown a  decline  ofunprecedented extent and rapidity.     The Sub-Committee came to a first general conclusion.   During the past tw:oyears an immense number of restrictions,  not only by way  of increases of tariffsbut also by  way of prohibitions, quotas, foreign exchange controls with  all theirconsequences (clearing arrangements, compensation agreements and so forth) havebeen super-imposed on the barriers, already  serious, which impeded international trade in 1929.   The possibility of recovery will be greatly facilitated  by the relaxation and abandonment of these additional restrictions.   This  problem  isclosely connected with the re-establishment  of freedom of exchange transactions and the abandonment of exchange control, and its solution  requires, especially  in central and Eastern Europe, co-ordinated action in the monetary and commercialfield.     But, at the  same time, in  order that  all the chances of  recovery may  bebrought to realisation together, it will be necessary to take steps to  reduce the excessive protectionism which seems to have dominated the commercial policy  of most countries both before and during the crisis.     The Sub-Committee emphasized that since the  war gold and internationalcapital  movements have played  an excessive part in the balancing of accounts.Except in the case of  gold-producing countries^ movements of gold can only serve as a temporary means of adjusting the balance of payments; and though capital movements have,  over a long period, been  a  very important element in balancingaccounts between lending and borrowing countries, in the long run the movements of goods and services  must be the chief elements in this process.   In fact, so longas the present crisis  lasts, they are the only means by which numerous  debtorcountries can meet their obligations.    The Sub-Committee also  found that the difficulties of many producers arecompelling them  to liquidate their  stocks  or production at low prices, and that
 these sales, by causing anxiety in countries to which  the resulting exports  are directed, are thereby giving rise to further measures which impede the process of restoring equilibrium.     On  the basis of the foregoing  considerations,  the Sub-Committee  dealt successively with the following questions :      (1) Import restrictions.     (2) Tariff policy.     (3) Treaty policy, with special reference to the most-favoured-nation clause;           Stresa Agreements.     (4) International economic agreements (wheat, coal, timber, &amp;c).     (5) Public works.     (6) Questions reserved by the Sub-Committee for consideration at its next      &apos;:.    session; export bounties, direct and indirect subsidies, anti-dumping      o     duties and measures,  marks  of origin,  Customs formalities and     .i: .    technique, unfair competition, compensation and clearing agreements      .j.    and other measures capable of impeding international trade, treatment      )L)     of foreigners.     In  this connection the Sub-Committee desires to express the opinion that, whatever may be the  need  for  ameliorating  measures  in  each  of the  fields indicated above, such measures should extend to the system of international trade as a whole.  If the International Conference is to revive commercial  relations between the nations by attacking in detail the root-causes of the present economic depression, it  must likewise review  the  system of international trade in  all its aspects.                     I. Problem of Import Restrictions.     1.  One fact emerges clearly  from  the various statements made before the Sub-Committee.     The existing restrictions are the  outcome of the crisis, and more especially of its most acute manifestations in the financial and  monetary  sphere, which appeared during the spring of 1931.  These measures have still further increased the gravity of  this crisis.  Previously, countries were tending to return, with a few exceptions, to the system of unrestricted commerce as defined by the Economic Conference of  1927.  The chief  form taken by State action  in regard  to  inter- national trade  was that of Customs tariffs.    2.  Those  countries that have applied restrictions have been led to do so for reasons which can be traced to two fundamental causes :     Some  of them  have  been primarily  swayed by  monetary  and  financial considerations.    These restrictions, whether they take the form of quotas, licences or exchange control, appeared to them to be a necessary means of preventing the depreciation of their.currencies in consequence of the effects of the crisis  on their balance of payments.   This is,  in  particular, the case with  countries which  are heavily in debt.    Other  countries have been guided by considerations which are rather  of  an economic character.  Some countries, which had consolidated a large part of their Customs tariffs and feared an influx of goods in consequence of over-production and the fall of prices in the world outside,  have looked to quantitative limitationof imports  by means of quotas or licences as the only way to protect their  national economy.   Moreover,  the obstacles placed in  the way of imports  in  several countries had had the effect of diverting goods from their normal markets anddirecting them to those countries to which they still had access.    Other  States, again,  though opposed  in principle to  this policy,  met themeasures which affected their exports by similar measures.  In this connection itshould be noted that certain  Governments,  which have made hardly any use  of restrictions hitherto, have indicated the intention of resorting to them in conse-quence of  the  progressive  contraction  of their markets  and  the consequentunfortunate effects on their economic life.    3.   The  experience that has  been gained during  a little over  a year hasdemonstrated  the regrettable  results of  the  policy  of  restrictions and the
 difficulties occasioned by its application.  Generally speaking, no one denies these results and difficulties, and all admit  that it would be desirable to bring about their removal as quickly as possible.     While several members of the Commission favoured  action on those lines, others have expressed the opinion that  it would be necessary, in the first place, to attack  the underlying causes of the evil rather than to endeavour to correct its immediate effects; however that may  be, the  conditions on  which such  action depends vary according to the cause which led to the adoption of the measures of restriction.  Various members  stated  that  the  abolition  of prohibitions  and restrictions would,only be possible subject to  a simultaneous settlement of the tariff problem.     4.   It would seem possible to secure the removal of restrictions primarily due to monetary considerations to the extent to which there may be an improvement in the situation in that respect.  Hence it would be desirable  for the question to be examined in this aspect.     Similarly,  restrictions  traceable  to  the  disequilibrium of  prices or  to restrictions previously imposed in other countries might gradually disappear as a better price equilibrium is re-established or as the latter countries abandon&apos;their restrictions.     5.   In the case of several countries the abolition of restrictions is bound up with various  conditions or concessions, such as tariff guarantees to ensure an adequate protection of  domestic markets  or to  procure  adequate  outlets; guarantees calculated to ensure a more satisfactory balance of payments, either by increasing the value of exports or by diminishing the burden of foreign  debt, or economic agreements to regulate production or sale.  It  was observed in this connection that  a distinction should be made between manufactured articles and agricultural  products, and  also  between  quotas replacing tariffs and quotas superimposed on tariffs.     6.  It was generally  agreed that the abolition of restrictions  can only take place gradually and must  be accompanied by the  necessary arrangements  for transition, while bringing about a sufficient degree of harmony with the improve- ment in monetary and financial conditions as a whole.  Early progress in this direction might be realised by the complete abolition of quotas no  longer obviously necessary, and, as regards products where such was not the case, by a gradual increase in the quantities allowed to be imported.  In this connection it appears desirable in so far as quotas are maintained,  they,  should  be raised to a levelcorresponding to the volume of &quot; normal &quot; imports, as is already done by certain States.     7.  The  abolition of  restrictions  might  be effected either  by autonomous action or by bilateral or plurilateral agreements.  It would be well to determine what prospects are offered by each of these three methods.     8.  It follows from the foregoing  that the Economic Sub-Committee mightpropose that the full Commission should place on the Conference^ agenda thepossibility of  concluding  an   agreement  (whose  main  outlines  it might subsequently  indicate) intended to secure the gradual removal of measures whichlimit quantitatively the import of goods (prohibitions, quotas, &amp;c).     Various  members indicated certain conditions  which  should be taken  intoaccount when considering  such action,  including particularly      (a) The power to maintain or provide the protection considered necessary for           certain branches of  production  by meahs of Customs duties which           might have to be raised.     (6)  On the  other hand, assurances that the advantages resulting from the           removal of quantitative limitations will  not  be neutralised by an           excessive increase in Customs duties.     (c)  Collateral agreements between producers (or countries) aiming at the           regulation of the production or exportation of certain products.     (d) Provision for a period  of transition,  during which the  quota system           would be relaxed and rendered more flexible so as to bring the quotas           to  the level of  &quot; normal &quot; imports.     9.  Exchange control  is a serious  impediment to trade.  In many  cases no action can be usefully taken to abolish prohibitions or restrictions unless exchange control, in so far as it has a direct or indirect influence on the international
movement of goods, is also relaxed or  abolished.  The origin of this control isto be found in difficulties connected with the monetary situation, which, however,will become less serious if hindrances  to  trade can be removed.  Accordingly,although these two questions must be treated separately, several members haveexpressed the view that a  collective agreement for the abolition of prohibitionsand restrictions is only possible on condition that the indirect limitations resultingfrom the control of dealings in foreign exchange and from compensation andclearing  agreements  are  abolished;  but  this  will  necessarily depend  on  therestoration of the monetary system and the equalisation of the balance of accounts.    10.  Certain members  drew attention to the harm done to international trade,over and above official restrictions, by way of boycott.                             II. Tariff  Policy.    The Sub-Committee  in its  consideration of  tariff policy  directed  itsattention to  the possibility  of  arresting new increases of Customs tariffs and bringing about a reduction of the present  level of duties.    It was generally recognised that  such action was highly desirable and wouldbe an  effective way  of improving the economic situation, and that it would constitute an essential factor in the re-establishment of the monetary and financial situation.    The discussions, however, brought out  the hesitation of various Governmentsregarding the future trend of their tariff policy.  It was pointed out that thishesitation is attributable,  not only to the instability of the  present economicsituation and the impossibility of foreseeing  its future development, but also tothe uncertainty prevailing in many countries as to the possible influence of  thefinancial position  and  exchange movements  on their balance of payments inthe near future.    The majority of the members of  the Sub-Committee feel  that in the present state of affairs the first effort should be directed against import prohibitions andrestrictions, though they are convinced that this question has an  extremely close connection, which should be taken into consideration, with possible guarantees inregard to tariffs.    It will  obviously not  be enough to suppress these restrictions,  if they  are merely to be  replaced by further increases in tariffs.   In some quarters the view was strongly sustained that the adoption of  more  moderate  tariffs should beregarded as one of the principal means of rectifying the present  disequilibrium,and  that in  this  connection  the  policies pursued by  creditor  countries  areespecially important.    It was recognized that tariff policies affect the social and economic structure of the countries concerned,  and that a sudden radical  reduction of all tariffsis not practicable.  It was suggested  that,  in  devising measures of possible tariffrevision, efforts should be concentrated on  securing  a  reduction of excessiveprotection, which has the effect of encouraging uneconomic production.  The view was expressed that the underlying objective should be to secure generally a more economic organization of production.    In this connection  several members drew attention particularly to the highprotection accorded in western European countries to agricultural products andto the causes of this protection.    Several  members observed that  the  current movement  of prices  on  thedifferent markets  is so extensive and irregular that a sudden relaxation  ofdefensive measures would lead to  an influx  of goods  which  would  have  a particularly  dangerous effect on national  economy, because large stocks are inexistence in  various  branches of production.   They, therefore, consider that  apolicy  aiming at a more liberal customs regime must necessarily be undertaken by stages;  a regime taking account of present exigencies would be  succeeded by a transitional  regime,  which, in  its turn,  would eventually  give  way to  aregime corresponding to a  normal state of affairs.    Other  members,  on the other hand,  emphasised  the  need  for rapid  and effective action in the tariff sphere, without  which no real improvement in  theeconomic situation of their countries appears to them possible.  They also feelthat other countries, and in particular   neighbouring  countries,  are  equallyinterested in such improvement.
    2.  Attention was drawn to the growing realisation of the close connection between exports and imports, and of the fact that during  the present paralysisin capital markets the only means whereby most of the.  debtor  countries candischarge their obligations is to export goods and services.    It was further pointed  out  that, while greater  freedom is necessary for ageneral economic recovery, it is a vital necessity for countries which are obligedto export a large part of their production.    It was further pointed out that the imposition of higher  tariffs tends toaccentuate the differences of price  levels between different countries, and thatthe necessary equilibrium can only  be restored if the countries with high-price levels admit goods from other countries and thus increase the purchasing powerof these latter countries.    It was further pointed out that the downward course of prices had hadthe effect of increasing automatically the  ad valorem  incidence of  specific duties,and it was suggested  that, in the case of countries  imposing such duties; theyshould be reconsidered in the light of existing price levels.    3.  Several members  laid great stress on the necessity, as a preliminary toa subsequent effort in the direction of a greater freedom, of  arresting the upwardmovment of customs tariffs and other protective measures.    4.  It was also emphasised in this connection  that  instability  of tariffssystems was no less harmful to international trade than high tariffs.    Other members of the Sub-Committee pointed out that instability of pricesmight cause an even more serious uncertainty, and they seemed to incline towardsapplying, as a purely temporary measure, a system of adjustable correctives, onthe understanding that the latter should  have no discriminatory character.                            III. Treaty Policy.    1.  Action in  the field  of treaty policy can be  taken by means either of collective agreements or of bilateral agreements.  Several members asserted thatone or other of those methods might lead  to a lowering of tariff barriers. Othersheld that the method most likely to lead  to results is the conclusion of bilateral agreements.    2.  The Sub-Committee is of  opinion that the general and  unconditionalmost-favoured-nation clause must remain the fundamental  rule of the  regime ofinternational trade. A policy based solely on the principle of reciprocity would inevitably lead  to serious  complications.    The application of the general and unconditional most-favoured-nation clause would be easier, if every country hada sufficiently liberal tariff system.    3.  Particularly  of late, differences  of opinion have  arisen  regarding therights conferred by the most-favoured-nation clause.    Although  most of these differences  arise out of exceptional  measuresdue to the state of crisis, it would seem desirable that the  most-favoured-nationregime should be defined in commercial treaties by provisions  based on uniformcriteria.  In this connection, certain members  referred  to the  formula preparedby the Economic Committee of the League, which has actually been adopted by certain countries in their most recent agreements.    Certain members  argued that the  recent  tendency to develop special orterritorial preferences would  have the  effect of reducing proportionately the sphere of application of the most-favoured-nation clause.    It was recognised to be desirable to reach an agreement on certain questionsregarding the application of the clause, more especially in regard to the excessivespecialisation of tariffs, quotas of every kind, anti-dumping measures and foreign exchange control.   The Sub-Committee thinks  that the question  might usefully be placed on the agenda of the Conference.    4.   Several members stressed  that  the seriousness of the  present  crisisjustified a less strict  application of the  clause, and  that  temporary exceptionsmust be allowed for.  The Sub-Committee recognised that the greatest cautionmust be exercised in taking any action in this  direction.   It would be difficult and dangerous to generalise: each individual case should be examined with thegreatest care, avoiding a discriminatory regime against third countries.
9 O 9k Q (j     5.  It was  suggested  that  the  general  and unconditional most-favoured- nation clause made it difficult, if not impossible, to conclude multilateral treaties aiming at the diminution of obstacles  to commercial relations.  As a palliative for this difficulty the Economic Committee of the League referred in its report of 1929 to a type of reservation which  has  already been embodied by various countries in recent commercial treaties.     Several members of the Sub-Committee expressed the desire that the question should be placed on ^he agenda of the  Conference,  and discussed on the basis of the report drawn up by the Economic  Committee of the League, with a view to ascertaining how far, under what conditions, and in respect  to what  collective treaties, an exception to the clause might be allowed.     6.   The Sub-Committee unanimously recognised that the exceptional position of tlifc agricultural countries of Central  and  Eastern Europe  demands an effort to devise&quot; and put in  force immediately  suitable means of coming  to their assistance!   Several  members recalled that  the concession of a  preferential regime for the importation of the surplus cereals of those countries into the European  importing countries had  been considered, more  particularly at the Lausanne and Stresa Conferences, on  the understanding  that such preferences could be conceded only as an exceptional and temporary measure  in respect of limited quantities, that they should not have  the effect of increasing production and that they should be subject to the approval of third countries.  Further, any compensation granted by the beneficiary States would be extended to all countries enjoying most-favoured-nation rights.     Certain members pressed for the inclusion of the problem in the Conference^ agenda,  in  order, more particularly, to facilitate its discussion with the third States concerned.  Others held, however, that the conclusion and application of agreements for the provision of assistance to the countries in question could brook  no delay  owing to the gravity of  their position.  They expressed  the hope that,  before  the  Conference met, solutions for  the problem  would have been found which would make it superfluous to place the question on the agenda. Still other members pointed out that the agricultural  crisis was a world-wide problem, and that it could only be remedied in any lasting degree by an improved organisation of production involving a reduction of the excessive protective duties in certain countries.                        IV. Customs Nomenclature.     The Sub-Committee noted with satisfaction that the labours continued over a  number of years with a view to the  elaboration  of a unified Customs no men- clature had  been concluded, and that a complete draft was now before  the Governments.  The desirability  of  placing the matter on  the agenda of  the Monetary  and Economic  Conference  with a view to expediting  the general adoption of this  nomenclature was recognised.                     V. Agreements  between Producers.     The Sub-Committee did not consider the  problem of international  economic agreements  in general.  The important  work  already done  by the  Economic Committee and other organisations in  this field made  this unnecessary.     It confined its  examination to  the  international  position with regard to certain essential  products, such as wheat, coal, timber, &amp;c.  It recognised that industrial agreements were primarily matters to be discussed  by the industries concerned, but it was suggested that the  World Conference might afford a suitable opportunity for discussions between the Governments as to their attitude to such agreements, which might conduce to their conclusion particularly in the case of certain commodities where Government  intervention  would  be necessary  to secure effective action.     In view  of the position of the wheat market, the question may arise whether an effort between the Governments  concerned to limit production  or exports, such as was already attempted at a meeting held in  London in  1931 by  the representatives of the exporting countries, might not  be  undertaken,  notwith-standing the great difficulty of establishing an international agreement embracingmillions of producers, dispersed  throughout all the countries  of the globe andimperfectly organised.
    With regard to the coal industry,  it will be remembered that experts have met at Geneva on various occasions since 1929, under the auspices of the EconomicCommittee.  Their last meeting, in January 1932, left the impression that therewas  some reason to  hope that the  idea  of  an international  organisation  of producers was feasible.  Since then,  however, no appreciable progress seems tohave  been made along those lines, in spite of the serious position of the coalindustry.    The over-production of timber, and the catastrophic fall in prices to which ithas led, induced the Economic Committee to hold, in April 1932, a meeting of experts from almost all the European countries affected.   As the outcome of thismeeting, an  economic conference on timber took place at Vienna, but there is, forthe moment, no visible prospect of an agreement which would obviate the risk ofunorganised competition.    The Sub-Committee was of opinion that the wheat, coal and timber questions should be considered by the Preparatory Commission at its next session, with aview  to deciding whether it is expedient to place them on the agenda of  theEconomic Conference.   Meanwhile, the experts will amplify their information,and,  if necessary, get into touch with the circles concerned.                            VI.-Public Works.    The question of public works wras considered by the Sub-Committee solelyfrom  the economic standpoint, as the question of the possibilities and methods of financing the works did not fall within its province.  It noted that the Committeeof Enquiry on Questions relating to Public Works had already considered, fromits own point of viewr, not only the technical value of the plans submitted to it bythe various Governments, but also  their economic utility.    In these circumstances, the Economic Sub-Committee had only to considerthe expediency of including this programme of public works, the economic valueof which has  already  been acknowledged by the Committee of  Enquiry, in thegeneral scheme of measures to be taken with a view to reducing the acuteness ofthe present crisis.    In the course of the discussion, the opinion was expressed that the executionof public works, considered from the standpoint  of  international co-operation,offers real advantages  for the general economic life, and should, therefore, beincluded in the above-mentioned scheme of measures to be considered, with a viewto economic recovery.   In particular, it was pointed out that the execution of suchpublic works  might mark the  beginning of a resumption of  activity  and arestoration of confidence; that, although j)rimarily of interest to the countries inwhich the works would be carried  out, more especially the agricultural countries,it would have equally advantageous effects for other countries supplying materials;and that such action would do much to remedy unemployment and thereby wouldbe of substantial and general economic advantage.     In conclusion,  the Sub-Committee, while observing that no opposition  was raised to the proposal to include the question of public works in the agenda ofthe Conference, referred this question, with a favourable opinion, to the FinancialSub-Committee for examination of the possibilities on the financial side, since itwould be useless to discuss the subject if there was no sufficient assurance that thework contemplated would  be financed.APPENDIX  III.FINAL SPEECH FOK BRITISH DELEGATION BY SIR F. W. LEITH-ROSS AT CLOSING                                 MEETING.    THE Aide-Memoires  which  have been circulated show  that close inter-dependence exists between the financial and economic discussions.   The EconomicCommittee found  that they could not&apos;  hope to deal  with  the  existing traderestrictions, unless action could be taken to abolish exchange controls involvingstabilisation of currencies.   The Financial  Committee, on the other hand, haspointed out that one of the conditions  for the stabilisation of  currencies  is a
9 Q9(V U lJ-- return to a reasonable degree of freedom in the movement of goods and services. There are several other passages in their Report to the same effect.  We have been working in a vicious circle, and the question is how this circle is to be broken.     For my part I am fully in agreement with the view expressed by the Financial Committee, which was also that of the Gold Delegation, that greater freedom in regard to the exchange of goods and services must precede monetary stabilisation. An essential part of the machinery which existed before the war is missing to-day. It was concealed so long,as New York lent,- but that lending has ceased and cannot be resumed unless it is given an economic foundation.     But when we come to try and give practical effect to this aim we are at once brought up by the difficulties created by the fall of prices, and it seems to me that the best way to break, the vicious circle would be to secure a substantial rise in the prices of primary commodities.     It is not  necessary to enter into a discussion of  the effects of falling prices. The consequences are financially inequitable, industrially disastrous, and socially intolerable.   The  report  of the English Committee on Finance and  Industry, generally called the Macmillan Report, which  was written  before England left the Gold standard, described them accurately in every  particular.   There can hardly ever have been a more  successful prophecy than the  following :          &quot; The fall in the prices of raw products is facing the debtor nations of     the world, which  are  dependent on the sale of such products, with tasks of     exceeding difficulty.   Superficially, the creditor countries  may appear to     obtain a  corresponding  advantage.  But this may prove delusive.  Inter- ^     national credit is  a fragile plant.  The effect of the pressure of the present     price level on the credit of  debtor countries may, if it is long continued, prove     so  serious  that their ability to  contract  new  loans will  be  dangerously     impaired.  The vicious circle will then be complete.   Creditor countries will     find that the security  of the  loans  which  they  have  already   made is     evaporating.  And the whole system  of international loans, on which the     trade and prosperity of the world and the development of  its natural resources     so largely depend, will be seriously affected.&apos;&apos; Moreover, again and again, the Macmillan Report emphasised what has been the real core of the present trouble since 1929, namely,  that industrial concerns in&apos; every country, even though of fully  average ability and despite every kind of assistance and protection,  simply cannot make profits.  This is causing the break- down of an economic society founded on the principle of an expectation of normal profits.     This seems  to me the all-important question.  And  I would beg members of the Committee not to regard it as a theoretical one; it is intensely practical.  Most, if not all, the  financial, and economic, and  many of our political troubles, can be traced directly to the fall  in the price level.  This has produced in a few years world-wide bankruptcies,  stoppage of trade, unemployment, followed  in many countries by revolution.  The peoples  of the world are  not going to endure this state of misery  for the benefit of monetary  doctrines.    It may be that more planning is required  on  the economic  side,  but the monetary  side cannot  be ignored.   The monetary machine was made for  man and not vice versa.    If the monetary machine we possess cannot be made  sufficiently flexible to meet  the  requirements of the modern world,  it  will certainly not  survive. Monetary theorists are always  demanding flexibility on the  economic side.   Is there not at  least equal justification  for  saying that  our monetary system is too  rigid 1    If the Bankers cannot put matters right, events will take  their own course. Already nine-tenths of the world&apos;s Budgets are not balanced, and if prices  do not  rise, there will be few countries  which have sufficient inherent strength to avoid the necessity of printing money.  It will be found nearly impossible to balance  State  budgets if  the trend of present  conditions is not  altered.   We happen  to  be  in an exceptionally favourable position in the United Kingdom,having made resolute  economies in good time,  having succeeded  in  stopping a further  fall  in  sterling  prices, and having made very great  economies byconversion.   But we had  plenty of experience before we left gold of  what it means to balance a budget on a rapidly  falling price level.  The Finance  Ministerfinds receipts falling off badly, and increases, therefore, the rate of taxation.  Atthe end of his Budget period he finds that he was not pessimistic enough  and that
the tax produces less revenue at the increased rate than it did before.   Then hetries again by further increasing the rate of taxation, and the same result follows.Sooner or later he must get  to the position where a  further increase in the rateof taxation would be unthinkable, as that factor by itself would bring traae andindustry to a stop, even if there were no crisis.  If no remedy for the presentdownward trend of prices is found, that, we  think, will be the position over thegreater part of  the world; and, of course, the stability of  any monetary systemarrived at could not be maintained under these conditions.    We are, of  course, well  aware that intense fear exists in many countries particularly those which have suffered in  the past from heavy currency deprecia-tion of what is known as the spiral of  inflation.   We respect that instinctivefeeling, but we believe it is  utterly out of relation  to present world conditions.There is  a spiral of  deflation, and the world  is descending  that spiral withalarming velocity.   Prices are still falling rapidly,  and with a few breaks thisdownward course has been persistent  since the autumn of 1929.  Can anyonecontemplate with equanimity a continuance of this fall over the winter ?   higher prices have sometimes been referred to as a particularly British interest, but theboot is on the other leg.  Depreciation involves many difficulties and dangers, butcountries off gold will  be  able to stand a further fall of gold prices with lessunpleasant consequences than countries on the gold standard.  It is to be feared that countries now clinging precariously  to gold may be driven off if the fall inprices continues, and still greater chaos in international trade and relations willsupervene.    I am disappointed  to  find  that so  little  is  said on this point in  the aide-memoire of the  Financial Committee.   It seems to imply that little morecan be done than at present  by monetary  action.   I must say that this seems tome a  confession of failure.  If action cannot be taken to raise prices  it means that the financial system is out of control.  After all the price level is the resultof the interaction of monetary and other factors, and monetary alterations mustcertainly have some effect on price levels.   There is  plenty  of experience ofthe facility with which prices can be raised in any single country, and that beingthe case why should it not  be possible to increase world prices by concerted actionon the part of all countries 1  The nearest approach to the present depression isthe depression which ended  about 1896 or 1897.  That  was eventually solved bya  long spell  of cheap money and by the  increased supply of gold  for monetarypurposes.  On the present occasion some similar expansion of the basis  of creditseems to be absolutely essential, and I hope that the Financial Committee will settheir minds to this task before the next session.    My country can obviously do no more than it has already done on this point,and&quot; we have done a great  deal.  But further we cannot go alone.  In view of ourcentral position  in world  trade  and finance  we must and shall take a prudentcourse.   Our ship  of State is traversing stormy seas and our efforts  must be concentrated on keeping her on an even keel. The main responsibility for creatingand maintaining conditions in which a rise  of prices will  take place now rests with the  other creditor countries  which   have   surplus  gold  reserves  andutilisable  assets.   It  is quite  true  that  you  can  take  a  horse to  thetrough,  but  you  cannot make  him  drink  at   once.   I  am  aware  thatabundant  credit is  available but not used.   We must see that it is  used andif this is done, if monetary policy is directed to secure a rise in prices and politicaland economic obstacles are not interposed, success will follow in this instance asin similar cases in the past.   If  the world is to overcome the present crisis thesesurplus gold reserves must not be sterilised, but must be  allowed to have their fulleffects on the internal price  levels of the countries concerned.  And further theseeffects must then be spread to the  rest of the world by admitting the goods ofother countries  with lower price levels. If a contrary policy is to be pursued, andthese creditor  countries  are  to restrict  their  imports and  impose additional restrictions, either by way of quotas or higher tariffs or anti-dumping legislation, it will become more and more difficult to restore equilibrium.      In this connection I should like in passing to mention the question of clearing or compensation agreements.  These agreements, so  far as they attempt to secure a balance  of trade between particular  countries, appear to be fatal to any restoration of the vitality of commerce.  These agreements have not, in  fact, bee&quot; working satisfactorily for any of the parties concerned.  They are, on the other hand, doing immense  harm to multilateral trade.   The Committee will, I hope, agree in condemning them.
    I hope that I have not taken too much of the time of the Committee.  But i feel bound to stress the extreme seriousness  of the world situation as we see itto-day.  It is not a situation which can be viewed with equanimity.   It requiresaction on  the part of all the authorities concerned.  It may be that such action-gives rise  to difficulties of an internal nature in each country.  Legislation maybe required to give powers to Central Banks which they do not already possess.Industries may have to  be controlled  or reduced in importance.  But if thesituation is to be cured, these remedies must be tried.  It is better to try them and see if they will help than to fold our hands and adopt an attitude of laissez-faire.If we are  simply to give the appearance of turning in a vicious circle within thewalls  of our prison  house,  the world will get tired very soon of these expertcommittees. We have at this  meeting got  to understand  some of our mutualdifficulties; we must submit them to our Governments; we must ask them to takea broad view of national self-interest; and we must remain in contact with a viewto preparing j)ositive solutions.o
