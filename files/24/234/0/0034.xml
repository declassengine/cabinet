              AIR ARMAMENT S .       There is no aspect of international disarmamentmore vitally urgent than the adoption without delay of the most effective measures to preserve the civilian population from the fearful horrors of bombardment fromthe air.  The Government .of the United Kingdom havealready stated that they would be prepared to go to any length, in agreement with other Powers, to achieve thisob .subject.       The proposal that all bombing machines should be abolished has been made from several quarters, andit has been claimed that the world-wide adoption ofthis proposal would ift itself guarantee the finalabolition of bombing.  This, however, is not the case,for machines not actually designed for bombing maynevertheless be adapted and used for that purpose.What would be involved, therefore, is the entireabolition, by. international agreement,  of military and   al machines^(apart ^om^maehines^needed for pollpurposes in outlying places), combined with an int-er-rjg- io:in 1 prohIVitio^-uf pOinbaa^g- o*nd effective inter-national control of civil aviation.  The difficulties to be surmounted in achieving, by international agree-ment, such a programme are evidently very great, but his Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to co-operate withthe other chief Air Powers in a thorough examinationinto the practicability of so extensive a scheme. .           3v- Alt - ^          &apos;V^*C   IrenKcw
