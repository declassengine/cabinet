THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1932.SECRET.                             &apos;                   Copy No.  3CP.  386 (32).CABINET.HOUSING  POLICY.                MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER  OF HEALTH.    A DECISION is needed on housing policy.    After the war we took the bull of housing shortage by the horns,  with ageneral subsidy.  For some time we have been trying to let go,  and finding itdifficult.   I  believe that,  with the fall  in  building costs and in the rate ofinterest, the long-awaited moment has come when we can  do so with safety.    To get an adequate and regular supply of small houses of the type required,we need conditions under which private enterprise and capital can find profitableemployment in their supply.  With the fall  in money and costs, those conditionsare now realised.  There is no obvious  reason why private enterprise and capitalshould not now provide the supply.  There is evidence that the chief thing thatprevents them   is the  competition  of subsidised houses built  by the  localauthorities.    The right course,  then, not for financial reasons only, but to promote thebuilding of  houses for  the working classes, is to stop the general  subsidy.    At the same time, it is not possible to cease all State help for housing.  Wecannot leave slum clearance wholly to private enterprise.   Slums are an evil thatneed the more immediate effort that State help alone can secure.   The proposals is. then, to concentrate  State-aid for housing on slum clearance, and to intensifyadministrative effort in that direction.  Future subsidies  would be given,  not forany small house, but only  for a house built to replace a slum dwelling.    Financial considerations are not  set in the forefront of this proposal, butthey are,  of course, very  relevant.  The effect of the proposals  is  to save theExchequer an increase  of  charges for housing of approximately  200.000 in thefirst year,  400,000 in  the second,   600,000  in the third  and  so on.    In the  following  memorandum,  the  reasons  for the  proposed course areexpanded and particulars are  given of the measures proposed.    The present rates of Exchequer subsidy and the provision made for housing-subsidies in  the  current estimates are shown in the appendix.1.  Provision of New Houses.    (i) As regards ordinary housing,  for  which the principal  subsidy is that given under the Act of 1924, three-bedroomed houses of an economical type cannow be built without any subsidy to let at rents comparable with the rents ofhouses provided hitherto with the aid of subsidy from the Exchequer and thelocal authorities.   On this and other grounds the Committee on  Local Expendi-ture, in their recent Report, have recommended, though not quite unanimously.the termination of subsidy  for ordinary housing under the Act of 1924.  Thefigures of building costs, subsidies and  rates of interest at different periods since1925 are set out and analysed in that Report and  the Committee&apos;s conclusion is  that     &quot; the average all-in cost of houses provided during the quarter ended the    30th  June last was  380,  and that  the economic  rent  of such a  house    (with money at 4 per cent, and repayment of debt in  sixty years) is 8s. Qd.    a week after providing  5 10s. per annum for repairs, maintenance,  voids.      [7870]                                                       n
    &amp;c.   When the scheme  of  subsidy under the Act of 1924 was initiated a    rent of 7s. del. was contemplated with the aid of subsidies.  In other words    a  position has been reached  where only del.  a week separates the possible    unsubsidised rent of a house  built to-day  from the subsidised rent required    at the  inception of the  scheme.....We  do not  consider  that there is    justification in maintaining the expensive and complicated mechanism of a    subsidised scheme for the sake of a figure which, on the  basis of a cost of     380 per house and interest  at 4 per cent., amounts to no more than 9d. a    week.&quot;    The calculation is undoubtedly well based.    The Committee also point  out that if the rate of  interest were to fall to3-i per cent, the 9d. difference  between the economic weekly rent and the rentregarded  as reasonable in 1924 would be reduced to 3d.; and the same result would  follow on a reduction of  30 in the average  capital  cost of a house, while areduction of  45 in the capital cost would wipe out the difference entirely.  they further suggest that by the exercise of more rigid economy in the layout, planning and specification of the houses the number  of authorities who can  to-day providehouses at a lower cost than  380 would be  considerably increased.    As a  matter of  fact, there  are  cases in which  it  is  being done at  a substantially lower figure.   In  recent months non-parlour houses with two orthree bedrooms have been built in four urban areas at a building cost of less than 260, and in a number of other  urban  areas at a building cost  of less than  300.The cost of land, roads and sewers is usually estimated at an average of  70,  andis  often as low as  50.  A total figure of  330 is, therefore,  now attainable infavourable circumstances in urban areas.    As to future costs, the Committee point out that experience has shown thatwhen on  previous occasions housing subsidies have been abolished or reduced, asubstantial fall in building prices has followed.    (ii) These figures  provide  strong financial grounds  for the immediatetermination of the subsidy under  the Act of 1924.    At the same  time it is  necessary to  consider the probable effect of such adecision on the total production  of small houses, whether by private or municipalenterprise, apd on the amount of unemployment in the building industry (to the limited extent, between 20 per cent, and 10 per cent., to which this depends onsmall house  building).  Private  enterprise already  provides without subsidynearly two-thirds of the total output of houses below  26 rateable value in theProvinces and  35 rateable value in the London area. There is no  reason why thetermination of subsidy should decrease this output. On the contrary, it is likelyto be substantially increased.  On  this  point the Committee say :          &apos;&apos; We consider it essential that the supply of what is still in many areas    in urgent demand should,  at the earliest practicable moment, be divorced    from considerations of  subsidy.  For at  present private  enterprise claims    that  it  is  deterred from  meeting   this  demand  by  fear  of  subsidised    competition, while, on the other hand, Public Authorities may naturally be    deterred, under existing financial  conditions,  by consideration of the charge    which the provision of new houses would throw on the taxes and the rates,&quot;and in their summary of conclusions, the Committee say :          &quot; We think it  probable  that the combined effect of  the saturation in    some districts of the demand for houses for sale, the withdrawal of subsidised    competition  in houses to let,  the general lowering of interest rates on gilt-    edged investments, and the reduction  in building costs will be to induce the    private builder and still  more important the private investor  to return    to the provision of houses for  letting to the working classes.  To this end we    consider that immediate policy should be  directed.&quot;    I  believe these recommendations  to be fully  supported by the facts of thepresept position.     (iii) There is evidence that  there are now large accumulations of private capital ready to  seek an outlet  in the  provision and ownership of working-classdwellings if the competition of subsidised building is withdrawn.  A numberof local authorities have recently been  approached by private capitalists desirous
of buying existing municipal housing estates, and important proposals have beensubmitted to me  by  the Building Societies whereby their  large funds would bemade available, on terms, for the provision of  new houses for sale or  lettingto working-class  occupiers.  The main proposal made by the  Building  Societiesis that a scheme should be authorised under which they would advance 90 per cent.of the valuation of houses erected by builders subject to a  three-party guarantee(to be shared between the Exchequer, the local authority and the Building Society)of the difference between this percentage and the percentage (70 per cent.), whichwould normally  be  advanced by  the Building Society under its rules.   Thisproposal will need careful  consideration and discussion with the local authorities,but I am not unhopeful that this or some similar arrangement could be made whereby a large  supply of capital might  be  made available on advantageous terms.    (iv) At the  same time until private enterprise gets  into its  stride  it isprobable that a number of authorities will find  it necessary themselves to providehouses to  let without subsidy, and I should propose to approve such proposalswhere it is  shown that there is a clear need  for  the  houses  and that privateenterprise is unable to meet it.    (v) Such  is  the general  outline of the proposals submitted in regard to-ordinary housing.  While we should rely on private enterprise to provide themain  supply of working-class  bouses in the future, it will remain the duty of thelocal  authorities, as before the war, to watch the position with care, and beprepared to supplement the action of private enterprise by themselves providinghouses of  an economical type  without subsidy from the taxes  or the rates wherethe need is shown to exist.2. Slum Clearance.    (i)  The statistics of house building since the war show the magnitude of the effort which has been made to  overcome the national shortage.   During the inter-censal period from  1921  to  1931 the number of dwellings  was increased  by1.704,530, and the number of dwellings  per thousand of population, which was215 before the war and 212 in 1921, was  increased to 244 in 1931.   These figuressuggest that in many districts the shortage must have been overtaken or at leastlargely  reduced, and the problem is now more of a local character.  On the otherhand, only the surface of the slum problem has been  scratched; the hope thatthe large provision of new houses would lead to a process of filtering up from theslums has in practice been falsified, and it is submitted that the limited resourcesof the State and of the local authorities  should now be concentrated on the  workof slum clearance.   The  energies of local authorities and their officers, if  nolonger preoccupied to the  same extent as hitherto with the provision of ordinarynew houses,  can be diverted in this direction.   I  attach much  importance to thishusbanding  of the resources and concentration of the energies of local authorities for the most urgent part of the problem, slum clearance.    The problem of the  slum is one of health rather than  housing,  and the concentration of the national effort on its solution is in no sense inconsistent withthe proposal to leave ordinary new housing, so far as possible, to private enter-jDrise.   To proceed now to concentrate effort and subsidy on slum clearance is a natural sequel to the decision made last January to restrict subsidy to the smallestand most urgently needed type of house.   The present  proposal is the second oftwo steps in a process of concentrating effort and expenditure on the purposemost needed.    (ii) The question of the rate of subsidy for slum clearance was considered bythe Committee on Local Expenditure, who recommended that       a reduction should  be made in the  existing Exchequer  subsidy and rate-    contribution  commensurate  with the substantial reductions in the cost  of    building and rates of  interest which have occurred since 1930.&quot;This recommendation would justify a reduction of nearly  1 per person displacedin the normal Exchequer subsidy of  2 5s., and of 10s.  per house in the existingrate contribution of  3 15s. per house.    Nevertheless. I am reluctant  on  general grounds to reduce the subsidy forslum clearance at  the same time as the cessation of the general subsidy. Althoughjustified by  financial conditions, the reduction must reduce the inducement to      [7870]                                                      n 2
the local authorities to take up slum clearance actively, and make it more difficultto stimulate them  to the necessary effort.  It will be  better, I suggest, to retain the higher subsidy for a time, to encourage the local authorities to transfer their housing energies to slum clearance.  An opportunity  will occur  in a years timeof reconsidering the rate of subsidy, when the attention of local authorities hasbeen attracted, and their energies applied, to the matter.  I propose, therefore,to make no reduction in the subsidy for slum clearance for the present.3. Rural Housing.    The Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931, provide an Exchequer-subsidy towards the  cost of reconditioning rural cottages, and the  Committeeon Local Expenditure recommend that this subsidy should be continued  and that greater use should be made of the facilities which the Acts make available.   Ishould propose to  accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation.    The Housing  (Rural  Authorities)  Act,  1931. made  provision for specialadditional Exchequer assistance to be  granted  on the recommendation of an advisory  Committee  appointed  under the Act (of which the  Right HonourableSir J.  Tudor Walters is  Chairman)  towards  the provision  of houses  foragricultural  workers  and  others  of a  similarly low  rent-paying capacity  in agricultural  parishes  and  rural  districts  whose  Councils  satisfied  certain conditions and made application before the 30th  November. 1931.    The Committee on Local Expenditure recommended that  applications  forfurther houses in excess of the maximum of 2,000, to  which the  Government lastyear restricted the scheme, should not be entertained.  The Advisory Committeehave already promised to entertain applications in respect of 1,717 houses, whichmust  be regarded  as  commitments, and  it is submitted that no  further commit-ments should be entered into.    The effect of terminating subsidy under this Act  and the  Act of 1924 shouldbe to encourage that greater use  of the Housing (Rural  Workers) Acts whichthe Committee on Local Expenditure have recommended.4. Consolidation  of Housing Subsidies.    The Committee on Local Expenditure recommend that, when further grants of  subsidy under  the Act of 1924 are  discontinued, provision should be madefor a comprehensive scheme of consolidation covering subsidy  under the housing acts  of 1919, 1923 and 1924.     I should propose to adopt the Committee&apos;s recommendation by talcing powers in the Act to effect such a  consolidation in consultation with local authorities atthe right time.5. Rent Restriction.    The Cabinet will remember that nearly a year ago I submitted a memorandumon Rent Restriction (CP. 305 (31)), and authority was given for the preparationof  a.  Bill following the lines of the recommendations of the  Inter-departmental Committee  which was presided over by  Lord  Marley, and which made  its reportin July 1931.     It is necessary  to consider the general  question of housing and housing subsidies in relation to the Government policy  as to the restriction of rents of privately owned  houses.   The  ultimate aim  in the  latter case is the complete removal of restriction, and in the former the complete abolition of subsidies.  Wecan, for the present, progress only by stages in each case, and the proposals made in this memorandum (as&quot;the Committee on Local Expenditure point out), are not inconsistent with a Rent Restriction Bill on the lines-of the Marley Committee&apos;s Report.  Indeed, whatever uncertainties attend the period  of transition from subsidy to private enterprise, and  some uncertainties there  must be, are an additional  reason for ceasing the decontrol  of the  smallest class of  house for the period. v6.  Financial Considerations.      The steady  growth of the  cost to  the Exchequer and to local authorities of ;tlie special arrangements made to meet the shortage in housing accommodation since the war  has^become a matter of very serious concern. The annual charge is now  approximately  13^ millions, and is increasing  at the rate of approximately
  350,000 a year.  It will not begin  to decline materially until 1940, even ii&apos; the provision for new subsidies is stopped now.  Every additional house approved for subsidy at the present ordinary rate involves an Exchequer capital liability of  150, payable as an annuity of  7  10s. per annum for 40 years.     The cost to local authorities, though much less substantial, is also serious, and will continue  for a similar period.     As already indicated, the Exchequer housing commitment is likely to increase by about  350,000 a year if the present rate of approvals for new houses (which has fallen considerably of late) may be assumed to continue.   Of this,   275,000 is in respect of the Act of 1924 and   75,000 in respect of the Act of 1930.  The latter represents about 6,000 houses  per annum.  In  present circumstances I  do not think  we  can expect, whatever stimulus we apply, to reach the high watermark of 27,000 houses  per  annum  contemplated  by  the five-year programmeprovided &quot;for  by the Act of 1930.   The  whole number  of  houses built for replacement of slums since the Armistice under legislation prior to the Act of1930 did not exceed 13,000.  If the annual rate should increase to 12,000 houses,the effect on the Exchequer of the present proposal would be as follows :                                                                          Retardation of annual commitment under the 1924 Act     275,000      Acceleration of annual commitment under the 1930 Act     75,000            Net retardation of annual commitment ...       ...     200,000     As the commitments  for new  houses  are  for  a period of  40  years, thisretardatipn is cumulative 200,000  in  the first  year,  400,000 in the  second.-600,000 in the third, and so on.7. Scotland.     A separate memorandum dealing with Scottish policy is  being  circulatedby the Secretary of State.  I agree with the adaptations of policy  to Scottishconditions which  he  proposes.  There has always  been a &quot;lag&quot; in Scottishhousing policy,  in relation to English.  The differences in Scottish  conditions,referred to by the Secretary of State, appear to me  to justify a continuation ofthe lag for another step, in the manner suggested.     8.

    I.  THE following are the housing subsidies available  under the  differentActs under which new commitments are still being incurred :     Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924.   7 10s. per house per annum for         forty years (in agricultural parishes,  11).    Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931.  One half of the annual cost         incurred by local authorities in providing assistance spread over twenty         years.    Housing Act, 1930.   Where rehousing is in  cottages  2 5s. per person for         forty years (in agricultural parishes,  2 10s.).             Where rehousing is in  tenements of more than three storeys on         cleared sites or on sites costing more than  3,000 per acre,  3 10s. per         annum per person for forty years.    Housing (Rural Authorities) Act, 1931.   In  addition to the subsidy of  11         payable under the Act of 1924, an  amount of  special assistance  to be         determined on the recommendation of an Advisory Committee appointed         under the Act.
