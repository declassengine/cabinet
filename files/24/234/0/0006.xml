Copy No.     1_56(32).                           0 A B I N S T.              THE BACON INDUSTRY AND OUR EXPORT TRAPS.          Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.          I have just seen the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s memorandum     (CP. 353 (32)) covering the report of the Reorganisation     Commission for pigs and pig products, in which the Minister     says that he is satisfied that the proposals put forward can     be regarded as a &quot;feasible and satisfactory scheme for the     organisation of the bacon industry&quot;, and asks for authority     to announce forthwith the Governments approval  of the     Commission&apos;s recommendations in principle.          I am so much perturbed by the general effect of the     report that as President of the Board of Trade I feel I must     at once invite my colleagues&apos; attention to some  of the     Commission&apos;s conclusions and their effect.          The first general proposal is that the total supply of     bacon and ham in the United Kingdom, domestic and imported,     should bo restricted, immediately the scheme comes into force,     to the average total supply in the years 1926-1930.   This     means a reduction of one quarter in the supplies available     to the United Kingdom consumer in 1931.          Foreign imports are to be cut down at the outset by     almost one third and thereafter progressively as home     production and, possibly, Dominion imports increase.          As my colleagues are aware, we have already had     conversations on the subject of a tariff agreement with both     Denmark and Sweden - among other countries - and formal     negotiations will open almost immediately.  The difficulties     of asking those countries to buy more of our coal, and coal-1
is one of the commodities for which we hope to secure realadvantages at a time when we are proposing to cut Denmark&apos;6principal export to- us by 30 per cent. , are obvious andpossibly insuperable.   My colleagues are also aware of thehelpful attitude of Denmark in recent months, as instanced by her use of exchange control to stimulate British exports, theAnglo-Danish Exhibition, and the very large orders placed inthis country as a result of the Exhibition.     In 1931 Denmark sent us bacon to the value of 22,400,000.   Bacon represented one half of Denmark&apos;s total exports to this country.  Sweden is also substantiallyconcerned;  she sent us  1,700,000 worth;  and the UnitedKingdom also took practically all the bacon exported from poland, Holland, Latvia and Lithuania.     The restrictions proposed by the Commission are far more drastic than those proposed under tho Ottawa agreements in respect of frozen meat.   They are permanent, instead of temporary;  the immediate reduction of foreign supplies is some 30%, instead of 10%;  foreign imports may ultimately be excluded altogether, and not merely ( if merely be theappropriate word) reduced by 35j&amp;;  the value of foreign trade restricted is over  30,000,000, instead of  8,000,000(leaving chilled beef out of account);  the homo industryaccounts at present for one eighth of the total supplyinstead of about half in the case of total meat supplies.In fact, whatever criticism may be made of the meat proposals may be made with far more effect and with far more justice of the bacon proposals.   If bacon cannot be produced on alarger scale in the United Kingdom without such a stunningblow at a friendly neighbour;  if we can only produce morebacon by paying so heavy a price in foreign trade; if this new industry cannot be assisted except by a 35J6 reduction
in the most -important &quot;trade of a country from whom we arenow engaged in securing commercial benefits and consequentlymore employment of our own labour - and I have said nothing of the consumer - then it would be as well for the Cabinet toconsider if it is really worth while.Board of Trade,   21st October, 1932,
