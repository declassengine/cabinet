DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANHIO MAJESTY&apos;3  QOV^HNi&amp;SNT. Ti.                                                  COPY HQ.    ^370 (32).                                CABINET.                   DYE3TUFF8  (IMPORT REGULATION) ACT. 1920,              Memorandum by the President of  the Board of Trade.           1. The Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act, 1920, which  came        into operation on the  15th January,  1921, for a period of  ten        years has  twice been continued under tha Expiring Laws Act.        It  is now due to  expire on the 31st  December, 1932.           2. The Act prohibits the Importation of synthetic organic        dyestuffs but at  the same  time gives the Board of Trade power,        on  the advice of  a Licensing Committee, to authorise importation        in  certain  cases.   Licenses have been freely issued in respect        of  dyes which are not  manufactured in  this country and for other        dyea when British makers are unable  to supply at the prices        quoted by foreign makers (provided that such prices are not        &quot;dumping&quot; prices).   There has been  no oomplaint in recent years        regarding the working  of this licensing system.           3. As in previous years, the question of the further        continuance of the Act has been under consideration by the        Dyestuffs Industry Development Committee which was set up under        the Act to  advise the  Board of Trade with respect to the        efficient and economical development of the dye-making industry.        That Committee has not beon able to  arrive at a unanimous        decision.   The members representing the interests of the  main        body of users of  dyestuffs have presented a minority report        proposing the discontinuance of the Act,   The members        representing the  dye-makers and all  the independent members        (with the exception of the Board of  Trade representative who,        for obvious reasons, has abstained from signing) recommend in        their majority report  that the Act should b-r\ continued on its        present basis for a further period of three ^ears.
     4. The position existing when the Dyestuffs ^ct waspassed has, of course, been radically changed by the passingof the Import Duties ixct, 1932.  Under the latter Act the dyestuffs which are imported under licence are subject to the10;c ad valorem duty and if the Dyestuffs Act is discontinuedthe dye^makers will no doubt seek additional protection throughthe Import Duties Advisory Committee.  This aspect of thematter is realised by the users, but nevertheless theymaintain their opposition to the continuance of the DyestuffsAct.  Their case briefly is that, during the twelve years inwhich the importation of dyestuffs has been restricted, asubstantial dye-making industry has been built up here and thatan agreement recently made between Imperial Chemical IndustriesLimited and the chief Continental makers sufficiently protectsthe home industry against its  chief competitors.  Pull detailsof this agreement have not been disclosed but it has not beendisputed that it restricts, in some way, competition from theContinents  The makers do not  agree that the protection afforded by this agreement is  sufficient as &quot;attack remainspossible on the part of other  makers both in the old world andnew&quot;.  This is of course a consideration which the makers wouldbe able to submit to the Import Duties Advisory Committee, ifthe Dyestuffs Act is not continued..     5. &apos;,vhen the Labour Government in 1930 proposed to allow the Dyestuffs Act to lapse strong opposition was aroused inmany parts of the House.  It will be remembered that theGovernment did not give way until its majority in the commons had dropped to six and the Lords had twice rejected the proposal.Since  that time, however, circumstsinces have entirely changed:there was  then no alternative  method of protection whereas thedye-makers can now, like any other industry, place their case before the Import Duties Advisory Committee for examination.                               -2-
Moreover, the present smooth working of the Dyestuffs Act is dependent on the willing co-operation of &quot;both users and makers,and the unanimous recommendation of the users in favour of itsdiscontinuance renders it more difficult for the Governmentto force the maintenance of the present system.     60 There is one further consideration to which I thinkit desirable to call attention, viz. that if we decide toabandon the method of prohibition and licence in this case itwill undoubtedly strengthen our hands when at the approachingWorld Economirj Conference we urge, as, I suggest, we shouldurge, foreign countries to abandon quota restrictions on theimportation of manufactured goods.  The existing international convention in regard to Import and Export Prohibitions andRestrictions, from which we have decided to withdraw next year,has broken down largely because of the general recognition thatin existing circumstances the regulation of the importation ofagricultural products can hardly be avoided, but I hope that itmay be possible to reach a more limited understanding thatmanufactured goods should be freed from such restrictions.  Tosuch an understanding we shall be in a better position tocontribute if we can point to the abolition in this country ofthe existing restrictions on the importation of dyestuffs,restrictions in regard to which it may be recollected we had tomake a special reservation when we became parties to theInternational Convention.     7. In all the circumstances, I recommend that the Actshould now be allowed to lapse on the 31st December.                                          W.R.Board of Trade,    31st October, 1932.
