9 COh \) ,jS jXCTJjjlMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S G-0V3RKMT).                                             Copy Ho.  &quot;/__                       CABINET.     Proceedings in  the  Indian  Legislative Assembly on              w  the   Ottawa   Agreement.                          ___J    Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary, of State, for India.            I circulate for the  information of my colleagues  ;  a telegram from the Government of  India, and a private and  personal  telegram  from the  Viceroy with regard to the  proceedings on the  Ottawa Agreement  in the Legislative Assembly.  The  latter telegram is in reply to two private wires  from  myself  emphasising;  the gravity of  the  matter and  asking for  information as to  the  proceedings.                                  S.H.  14th November  1932.                                                -        Telegram from Government of  India, Comnerce Department,            to Secretary  of State, dated  10th November 1932.            Ottawa agreement legislation.  As result  of 3i days&apos;  debate  on Governmenfs  resolution  it became apparent that                                                            -  very large section  of  the Assembly was  not prepared to  accept  the resolution  without  further  enquiry into details  of the  agreement by Committee  of the House.  Amendment of  Governmenfs resolution was moved  on Monday asking for  appointment of such Committee. We  decided to-day that it was  necessary to accept this proposal  in modified form, and  Committee  of 15 members  of  the Legislative Assembly has  accordingly been appointed  to  examine  the trade agreement  and  report to  the Assembly  by  21st November.  Meanwhile,                                                       furtherC! 7? n O TP T1o A KJ n Hi J..CP.393G2)

There was indication that number of ourpossible supporters considered request for further timefor examination not unreasonable, and since considerable opposition to agreement has manifested itself, owinglargely to propaganda by Federation of Indian chambers of Commerce, it was clear that margin of votes in our favour would, anyhow, be narrow, and that possiblyamendment to the resolution might even be carried against us.    In order not to antagonise our possible supportersat this and later stages and to avoid the risk that theamendment to the resolution, which would Viave meant.indefinite delay, would be passed against us, wearrived - after considerable discussion with the party leaders - at agreement on a Committee, consisting solelyof members of the Assembly, to report on the agreement Josephe.erceer  of         I have seen Shore and following representsposition in more detail.  I am fully alive to yourdifficulties and only wish I could be of more assistance,by
  26Zby 21st November. Committee has held its first meeting to-day.         Though we are as anxious as you to avoiddelay&quot;, we are of definite opinion that our acceptanceof a Committee in this form improves chances of ultimate passage of Shore&apos;s resolution and of bill.&apos;We cannot, however, as yet express any definite opinionwhether the Assembly will accept resolution or billin which in any case they may propose changes sincevoting strength for and against bill is likely to bevery evenly balanced though present indications point to its being slightly in our favour.         probable future programme is as follows.Committee&apos;s report will be laid on the table on21st November and its consideration may be concluded by the latter end of that week, when if vote on resolution is in our favour, bill will be introduced. further stages in Committee and Assembly can hardly -becompleted before the loth December, since any attemptto rush matters will definitely jeopardise bill beingpassed,  passage through Council of State should not take long.
