Ill             UKE&amp;EPLO iliENT C OMIT TEE.                 INTERIM REPORT.               Note by the Treasury.     I.    The Report of the Unemployment Committee is drawn on the assumption that no change is made in the existing arrangements for out-door relief and transitional payments.          On that &quot;basis the Treasury offer the following observations j-     1.    Schemes for voluntary work.          The Treasury raise no objection to the proposalsof the Committee under this head subject to the followingpoints :-    (1)    The scheme should definitely be described as  experimental.   Only indeed on this &quot;basis could the  Government justify commencing it without prior legisla-  tive sanction.    (2)    The details of the scheme of grants should be  settled between the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury.    (3)    The proposed encouragement of the provision of  educational facilities for the unemployed referred to in  paragraph 5 should be reserved for consideration until  the Committees now examining Local Expenditure have  reported and  the policy of the Government as  regards  local expenditure has been determined.          Attention should, however, be  drawn to  the possibledanger which might be involved  in the adoption  of the proposals&quot;by themselves as a new Government plan for dealing with theunemployment problem,,   It would be difficult to get  themlooked at in the right perspective; much more would &quot;&quot;be  expected-1-
from them than they could produce.   The Report itselfmakes it clear that the scheme proposed would effect verylittle in the first year and indeed gives explicitwarning against making exaggerated estimates of its immediate effect.                2&quot;  Allotments for the Unemployed.        The Committee agree that for the Season 1933nothing more can be done.   Their scheme for the Season1934- the Treasury regard as premature and in any event asopen to grave objections.        The scheme envisages that Local Authorities willbe encouraged to acquire land provided that no loss v/illhe incurred.   It is very doubtful whether they would feelsufficient confidence to embark on the scheme without a promise of State assistance in the event of loss andprobably the proposals would be wholly abortive unless a promise of Exchequer subsidy were made.   This would involveoperating for the first time the Agricultural Land(Utilisation) Act 1931 which is entirely in abeyance.   Suchaction would also be particularly unfortunate at the presenttime as the Committees now considering local expenditure are about to report.   There has been a good deal of criticism to the effect that Local Authorities incur heavycommitments because they are under constant pressure fromthe Government to expand their services.   A circularpressing fcr activity in any particular field might wellstultify the drive for all round economy and cast doubts on the Government&apos;s sincerity in inviting the co-operation ofLocal Authorities in an enquiry into expenditure.   II,   The fore-going observations are based on theassumption, as stated, that no change is made in the present arrangements for outdoor relief and transitional payments.
                                                         1 y ?iThe Treasury observe, however, that consideration is nowbeing given to the formulation of a permanent scheme fordealing with the able-bodied unemployed and for this reason it would seem premature to come to any decision on theCommittee&apos;s recommendations until it is seen how they would work in with any scheme that may be adopted.    There is nothing to be lost from the point of view of work this winter by postponing consideration of the two schemes;while they could be viewed in a better perspective if theywere presented as part of a permanent scheme.   For these reasons the Treasury strongly suggests tiiat a decision onthe Committee&apos;s Report should be postponed.   III.   The Kielder Estate,   The Committee have added totheir two main recommendations a proposal for a Ministry ofLabour residential labour centre on the Kielder Estate ofthe Forestry Commission.   Nothing is said in the Report ofthe additional cost to the Forestry Commission involved inthe proposal and it would seem to need closer examinationfrom the financial aspect than the Committee have so fargiven it.    Prima facie a scheme costing at the rate of  52per head for running expenses in addition to initial capital cost, to additional expense to the Forestry Commission and to ordinary payments of relief is more costly than can well becontemplated in the present circumstances.
