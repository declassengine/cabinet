THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.CP.  354(32).                                      Copy  No.   3                        CABINET.      Memorandum by the President of the  Board of Trade.                      BRAZIL AND uTTAWA.             I circulate herewith a note of an interview with      the Brazilian Ambaosador.  The Ambassador was  anxious      that my colleagues should be aware  of his representations.             I am having his statements examined in the Board of      Trade,  so far as they concern my Department.  He will, I      fear, expect an answer shortly.W.R.Board of Trade.    20th October, 1932.
                                                    1 9 9                                                    a. &amp; o     The Brazilian Ambassador, accompanied by theCommercial Attache, called at the Board of Trade to-day.He said that he knew the President was very fully occupiedat the moment, and he had not wished to wait until thePresident might have more leisure before making hisrepresentations.     He came, he said, informally, because he thoughthe could put his case more freely and fully than hewould wish in formal representations.   He had onlyyesterday seen the announcement in Appendix 8 to the summary of the Proceedings of the Imperial EconomicConference concerning duties on bananas and grape-fruit.     As he had pointed out before, the balance oftrade between Brazil and the United Kingdom had forlong been very favourable to the United Kingdom, andalthough, owing to internal and external troubles,Brazil had been obliged to cut down imports and toimpose various restrictions, in the last few months the United Kingdom had again sold more to Brazil than she had bought from Brazil.   In fact, as world conditions improved Brazil would again become a very good customer.   Yet the British Government now proposed,in addition  to the duty on oranges, which had been avery severe  blow to Brazilian exports, to imposeprohibitive  duties on Brazilian grape-fruit and bananas,and that although British capital was largely concernedin the plantations and in the transport of the fruit.He could not exaggerate the apprehension felt in Brazil;and there was one aspect of the question which filledhim with particular alarm.    Some 300 millions sterlingwere  invested in Brazil.   In spite of all herdifficulties, Brazil had made every effort to continue-1-
remittances and her  recent allocation of S500,000  to meetobligations in London in  the middle of her internal troubleswas a clear proof of Brazil&apos;s  desire to meet all obligations,.But he seriously feared that this further restriction  of oneof Brazil&apos;s few exports to this country might make itimpossible for her to continue to meet her obligations *     There was a commercial treaty between the two countrieswhich provided for unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment.   By that treaty Brazil&apos;s hands were tied;  butit was a treaty -which now gave every advantage to the UnitedKingdom and none to Brazil.   For the sake of justice, of friendship, and our own commercial and financial interests, hecould only beg us to reconsider these duties.     The Ambassador left an improvement*ession that, had he had timeto receive full instructions from his Government, he mighthave spoken more definitely on the question of remittancesand on the question of the treaty.   He referred to theformer question repeatedly;  while on the question of thetreaty he asked before he left what proposals Brazil could make as a basis for negotiations between us if these dutieswere maintained.Board of Trade,   20th October, 1932.
