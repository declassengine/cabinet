1 MEMORANDUM   INDICATING   REASONS   WHY  THEI    GOVERNMENT  OF THE  IRISH  FREE  STATE  HAS     DECLINED TO MAKE CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO THE     GOVERNMENT OF  GREAT BRITAIN.(Forwarded by Mr. dc  Valera tinder date 12th October, 1932.)  1.  As indicated in its  despatches the Government of  the  Irish free State declines to recognize that  there is any  binding  force in  certain instruments upon which the British Government rely. Tho instrument of the 12th February, 1923, relied  upon in despatch No. 87  of 9th  April, 1932,  is  not a  binding  instrument because amongst other reasons it was not  submitted to the Oireachtas for ratification.  It does not purport to have been signed by accredited representatives  and,  moreover,  it  was merely provisional.    The Heads of the Ultimate Financial  Settlement  of  the 19th day of March, 1926, are open to the same objections.                  Land Purchase Annuities. 2. The Government  of the Irish Free State contends that the Land Stocks are part of  the Public Debt  of the  United  Kingdom and should, therefore, under the Agreement of the 3rd December, 10-25, which  amended the Treaty, remain a liability  of the United Kingdom.    It  is also contended  that under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,  the annuities were &quot; gifted &quot;  to the two legis- iatures contemplated under that  Act.  The view of the Government of the Irish Free State as regards the instruments  of 1923 and 1926lias already  been stated.   The contention put  forward in  yourdespatch No. 87 that these payments are not  inter-Governmentaldebts but are of the nature of private debts between the purchasers of  land in Ireland and the holders of  stock is, in the view of theGovernment  of  the Irish  Free  State, unsound.   The stockholderhas no relation with the persons  who pay annuities.  As illustrating the true position the provisions of Section 26 of the Government ofIreland Act, 1920, may be referred to.   By this section the Govern-ment of the  United Kingdom accepted liability to provide for thedividends on the stock.  The tenant purchasers were not  consultednor were they privy to the arrangements thus made.   This arrange-ment was carried into effect in the application of the Act to NorthernIreland.   Further,  in view of all  the historical  circumstances, itis not equitable  that the Irish people should be obliged to pay awaytiiese moneys.
                  Bonus and Excess Annuities.  3. The arguments in regard to Land Purchase  Annuities applyalso here.  These Annuities were part of the price to be paid bythe  Government which devised,  and accepted  responsibility  for,the Land Purchase Acts, the Bonus Annuities being the price toensure acceptance by the landlords, and  the  Excess Annuities theadditional  cost  to  secure from the investors the supply of cashnecessary to  make the  transaction possible.               Royal Irish  Constabulary Pensions.  4. It is contended on behalf of the Government of the Irish FreeState that neither the Treaty nor the  Agreement amending theTreaty  imposes on the Government of  the Irish  Free State  any liability for either-       (a) The pensions of pre-Treaty pensioners and the allowances     to their dependants, or       (b) Compensation or other  payments to disbanded members     of the Force.It will be recollected that the post-Treaty Eoyal Irish Constabularydid not retire in consequence of the change of Government nor werethey discharged by the Irish Government, but they were disbandedby the British Government under a British statute, the Constabulary(Ireland)  Act, 1922.  Historically, as the Royal Irish Constabularywas an occupying force, hostile to the national aspirations  of theIrish people,  it would not be right or equitable to impose a charge for  their pensions, etc., on the Irish people.                   Civil and Judicial Pensions.  5. To the  extent that these pensions  are  paid  to persons  who retired prior  to  the change  of  Government no liability therefor is imposed by the  Treaty or the amending Agreement or accepted iuany other valid Agreement  by the Irish Free  State Government.These  charges should therefore remain  a  liability of  the  BritishGovernment.  With regard  to these pensions any liability attaching to the Irish Free State should be discharged directly by it.                     Local  Loans Annuities.  6. It is  contended  that  Local Loans  Stock was issued by theState in pursuance of State policy and is part of  the public debt.Accordingly,  by virtue of the Agreement amending the Treaty dated3rd December, 1925,  the Irish Free State has no liability to makeany contribution towards the service of such  debt.Public Offices (Site), Telegraph,  Marine Works, Military Works,                   Railway Works Annuities.  7. These annuities represent contributions  towards the serviceof the public  debt in  the United Kingdom, and the arguments setout in  the preceding paragraphs apply.
FURTHER  MEMORANDUM  DEALING  WITH  CLAIMS    PUT  FORWARD  BY  THE GOVERNMENT OF  THE    IRISH FREE  STATE.(Forwarded by Mr. de  Valera under date 13th  October. 1932.)              1. Counter-claim under Article V.  Article V of the Treaty provided for the investigation of a counter-claim on the  part of the Irish Free State.   This counter-claim hasnot been waived and the Government of the Irish Free State nowputs it forward.  It  will  include, amongst other things, a claim for  recoupment in respect of  over-taxation since the Union  anda claim for a share of the assets of the former United Kingdom.            2. Abandonment of the Gold Standard.  The Irish Free State Government claims compensation in respectof the loss sustained by Irish Free State interests in consequenceof the action of the  British Government  in  September, 1931, insuspending gold payments.                       3.-Road Fund.  The Government of the  Irish Free State claims that it is entitledto a share of the Road Fund of  the United Kingdom.  The caseunder this head has already been furnished to  the Treasury.                         4. Coinage.  The Government of the Irish Free State claims that the  British(government is liable to redeem all British Token Coinage renderedredundant in the Irish Free State by the issue of the  NationalCoinage there.                         5. Currency.  The Irish  Free  State Government  claims the full amount ofthe  profits derived by the British Government  between the 1stApril, 1922,  and  the 9th September,  1928, inclusive, from  the circulation of British Treasury Notes in the Irish Free State  aiidfrom the Treasury Notes or Certificates required to  be held  bythe  Irish Banks to cover their note circulation appertaining  to thearea of the Irish Free State.         6. National Teachers&apos;  Pension Fund Deficit.  The Government of the Irish Free State -claims that the BritishGovernment  should  assume liability for the actuarial  deficit thatran  be shown to have existed in the Fund at the  date of its transfer.167&apos;JfJ
                 7. Other Claims and Items.  The Irish Free State Government will also raise for considtra-tion  other minor claims and items including the following :         (a) National   Health  Insurance  (Women&apos;s  Equalization!     Fund.       (6) Receipts under  Articles 296 and  297 of the Treaty of     Versailles  and  the  corresponding Articles of the Treaty of     St: Germain.       (c) Quit  Rents.       (d) Dead Notes.       (e) The Irish  Free State&apos;s  share of the assets  of the Post     Office Ravings  Bank  held against  dormant  accounts  located     in the Irish Freo State.       (f) Proposals for the settlement of future Estate Duty eases     on the basis of domicile instead of  by way of double taxation     relief.   The appropriate  Departments  of the British  Government  are already  familiar with the views of the Irish Free  State Govern - ment  on these matters.
in.UNITED  KINGDOM  OBSERVATIONS  ON  THE  IRISH  FREE STATE MEMORANDUM OF 12th OCTOBER, 1932.(Forwarded to the Irish Free State  Representatives on the                   15th October, 1932.)            1.-The Agreements  of 1923 and 1926.  According to the recognized practice of  nations, agreements con-clnded between representatives of Governments are binding uponthe  Governments  concerned unless  they are expressly stated  tobe subject to ratification.  No such statement occurs in the  Agree-ments either of 1923 or of  1926 which were signed  by Ministersoti each side.   On the Irish Free State side  the 1923  agreement was  signed  by the  President of the  Executive  Council and thel&apos;,)26 Agreement  by the  Minister of Finance.  The  Irish FreeState  Parliament  passed  legislation in  1923, subsequent  to theAgreement of that year,  to give  effect  to  that part of it  which provides for the payment of the  Land  Annuities to  the  appropriatefund (i.e., the Land Purchase  Fund  held  by the National DebtCommissioners).   As regards the other  payments, the sums re-quired have been regularly voted each year by the Irish Free StateParliament and included  in the Appropriation Act.  The 1923  Agreement was admittedly  provisional in the. sense that it was  expressed  to be without prejudice  to the UltimateFinancial Settlement, but this  does  not alter  the fact that the19:23 Agreement was in force unless altered by the Ultimate  Finan-cial  Settlement.   In fact,  it was not  so  altered  and thereforeremained in force.   Article  12 of the  1926  Agreement  provides  interms  that &quot; for the purposes of any previous Agreements betweenthe  two Governments this Agreement shall be  deemed to  be theUltimate Financial Settlement mentioned therein.&quot;                2. Land Purchase Annuities.  (a) There are many  considerations  which  show that the IrishLand  Stocks are  not part of the Public Debt or National Debt  ofthe  United  Kingdom.  They have never been so  shown  in theUnited Kingdom Accounts :  they  are  a  contingent liability, sincethe primary security is the Land Purchase Fund and  the  UnitedKingdom Government are only guarantors.  The following statutory provisions also show that the Land Pur-chase  Stocks are  not to be regarded as part of the National Debt.The  Purchase of Land (Ireland)  Act, 1891, provides (Section 1 (2) )
that stock issued under that Act &quot; shall be redeemable  in acco^T)ance with Section 2 (2) of the National Debt Conversion  Act, 1888.as if it  were stock redeemable under that Section .  .  .  .&quot;  again the Irish Land  Act,  1903,  Section 32,  provides  that  &quot; for  thepurposes of  calculating  the  annual  sums payable .... for  themanagement of the  National Debt, the stock shall be  considered as part of the National Debt inscribed.&quot;  Apart  from these  technical considerations, it  is perfectly clearthat, when the Agreement of 1925  was signed, by which the IrishFree State  were absolved  from bearing any share  of the public debt of  the United Kingdom, neither party intended  to include in this term  the Land Annuities : this is shown  (inter alia) by thefact that the subsequent Agreement of 1926 provided  for the pay-ment  of the Annuities in full and without deduction of IncomeTax to the National  Debt Commissioners.  (b) As regards the contention that the Annuities were  &quot; gifted &quot;to the Irish Free State Government under the Government ofIreland  Act, 1920, Southern Ireland refused  to  accept  the settle-ment of 1920 under which Southern Ireland would have been a subordinate  Government and would  have made  a contribution to imperial expenditure.  The financial provisions of the Act of 1920did not, the United  Kingdom Representatives  are advised, evercome into force as regards Southern Ireland and the proposed settle-ment of 1920 was replaced by the Treaty of 1921 under  which theIrish Free State &quot;acquired Dominion  status.  (c) The Land  Annuities are debts due by the Irish Free Statetenants,  in  respect  of the sums advanced to enable them to  buytheir lamd, to the Land Purchase Fund held by the  National DebtCommissioners,  which have been collected by the Irish Free StateGovernment  as  agents, which that  Government have no right to collect  except as agents, which they are bound to pay over whencollected and which  the Irish Free State legislature has provided(Section 12 of the Land Act of 1923)  shall be paid over.  It is  for this reason that  the  payments  cannot  be regarded asinter-Governmental debts.  (d) The statement that in view of all the historical circumstance^it is inot equitable that the Irish people should  be obliged to  pay-away these  moneys is understood to mean  that  Ireland was over-taxed in the past.  This is a point raised in the second Memorandumof the  Irish  Free State Representatives and will be dealt with in answer  to it.             3. Bonus and  Excess Stock Annuities.  This is purely an Irish service, and the English farmers received no corresponding advantages.  The resulting financial charge to the taxpayer should  therefore  be borne  by the  taxpayer  of the IrishFree State and not by the taxpayer of Great Britain  ; otherwise theEnglish  farmer would be  asked to  pay taxes in order to confer
f lion  the  Irish farmer a  benefit which  he himself has never re-eeived.  Despite these considerations, the United Kingdom Govern-ment  agreed in 1923 to relieve  the Irish Free State taxpayer fromthis burden to the extent of approximately  .1 million a year.  TheUnited Kingdom Representatives regard the matter as settled  bythe Agreements of  1923  and 1926  in  the  same way as the main question of the Land Annuities.                     4. R.I.C. Pensions.  This question was settled by  the Financial Agreements of  1923and 1926,  and the United Kingdom  Representatives  regard  thesettlement  thus reached  as final.    Police functions, in common with other Governmental functions, were taken over by  the IrishFree State when it was set up.   The cost of police pensions existingat the time of transfer was a normal part of the cost of the functionsof Government which  any Government would expect  to have to hear.   The pension of the R.I.C. constable is in  no different posi-tion from  that of the pension of a retired postman, and the taking over of these liabilities was a necessary corollary of the separation of the two States.  The disbandment of the R.I.C. was a step taken in agreementwith the. Irish Free State  who did not  desire  the Force to be main-t lined; this measure, taken at  the  desire of the  Irish Free State,does not absolve them from the  cost of the compensation payments to disbanded  members of the Force, since it in no way alters thefact that the R.I.C. had  been one of the Forces discharging Policefunctions prior to the transfer.                5. Civil and  Judicial Pensions.  The payment of these pensions was also a corollary of the transferill  Government  to  the Irish Free  State.  The  general  principleadopted was  that  the  various  Departments  were handed over as&quot; going concerns &quot; with  all their  assets and  liabilities  attached.The pensions of the judges were one  of the liabilities just as thejudicial buildings and  equipment, which were handed over free.were included  in the assets.                  6. Local Loans Annuities.  This question was settled by  the Financial Agreement of 1926,and the United Kingdom Representatives  regard  the settlementthen reached  as final.  The Local Loans Stock is  not part of thePublic  Debt of  the  United Kingdom  since  the  primary securityis the  Local Loans Fund  and the United Kingdom Government areonly guarantors.  In effect the Irish Free State  merely act as  an agent  to collect the payments due by the borrowers and pay the mover to the Local Loans Fund, although, as a matter of convenience,the payment to the Local Loans Fund takes the form of a 20-year
r15 /i October, 1932.annuity of ^600,000.   If the Irish Free State disclaim responsibility )for the payment to the Local Loans Fund, what is  their  right to collect the payments due  to  the  Fund by the borrowers,  since iiwas the Local Loans Fund,  and not the Irish Free State, which made the advances?                7. Public Offices, etc., Annuities.  The  advances were made  for purely Irish  services and  the annuities required for their repayment were  divided between theIrish Free  State and  Northern  Ireland according  to  the worksexecuted in their respective areas.  The Irish Free State,  and notthe  United Kingdom taxpayer, is clearly responsible  for payingannuities in  respect of advances  made  to provide public offices in dublin and railways  and harbour works in other parts of the IrishFree State.  The liability to  pay the annuities in respect of build-ings  financed by a- loan  is precisely  similar in character to  theliability  to pay  the  rent of  a building  held on  lease from a  locallandlord.  These annuities are not part of the Public Debt of  the UnitedKingdom,  but  are  shown  in the accounts  as  &quot; Other   CapitalLiabilities.&quot;
UNITED KINGDOM  OBSERVATIONS  ON THE IRISH      FREE STATE FURTHER  MEMORANDUM.  .(Forwarded to the Irish Free State Representatives on the                  nth  October, 1932.)        1. Counter-claim under Article 5 of the Treaty.  Article 5 provided that the Irish Free State shall assume liabilitylor  the  service of the Public Debt of the United  Kingdom&quot; insuch proportion as may be fair and equitable, having regard to anyjust  claims on the part of Ireland  by way  of  set  off or counter-claim.&quot;  By Article 2 of the  Amending Agreement of 1925 &quot; the  IrishFree State is  hereby  released from  the obligation under Article 5of the  said Articles of  Agreement to assume the  liability therein mentioned.&quot;  It is understood that the Irish Free State Government considerthat this  Article  of the Agreement of 1925 does not debar  them from presenting a counter-claim under Article 5 of the Treaty andthey support this  view by pointing out that Article 10 of the Headsof the  Ultimate  Financial  Settlement of  1926  provides  for the waiver by the Irish Free  State of certain claims which might beregarded as a set off, but does not refer to their claims, such as thatin respect of the over-taxation of Ireland  before the Treaty, whichare regarded as counter-claims and not as a set off.  The  United Kingdom Representatives would point out that the plain meaning of  Article 5 of the Treaty is that a counter-claim on the part of Ireland will be taken into account  in determining the liability of the Irish Free State for the service of the public debt of the  United Kingdom and  for that purpose alone.   Thisliability has been  entirely waived and the  question of aUy set offor counter-claim against this liability no longer  arises.  The  United Kingdom  Eepresentatives regard  it as quite  clearthat the purpose  of Article 5 of the Treaty was the ascertainmentof what Ireland was  to pay.  It was fundamental in the Articlethat there could be no question of Ireland receiving  money  under it.  There was therefore no need for any  special provision regard-ing counter-claims in  the Agreement of  1925,  but it was natural that Ministers in  1926  felt that, in the Ultimate Financial Settle-ment,  it should be made doubly sure that  all counter-claims were.regarded as having been waived.      -rv*.
  The United  Kingdom Representatives maintain  therefore thuCno claim can be admitted  from the Irish Free State in  respect of&quot;over-taxation  in  the  past,  but  they  would  add  the  following observations.  It is understood that the Irish Free  State Representatives have in mind an amount, without interest, of  400 million and that thebasis  of the claim is the Reports of the Childers  Commission andthe Primrose Committee.  The Report  of the Primrose Committee of  1912 does not dealwith the question of over-taxation in the past, but states that thelocal  expenditure  of Ireland at that  date exceeded  its existingrevenue by over  2,000,000 a jear.  The Report  of  the  Childers  Commission  made no attempt toestimate  the total  amount  of over-taxation of Ireland  in the  past.but the draft  Report prepared  by Mr.  Childers before  his  deathestimates  that  in 1893-4 Ireland was over-taxed to the extent ol&apos; 2\ million a  year,  and  indicates  that  there may have been  someover-taxation (with no attempt to  estimate its amount) since 1851.  Wlnle estimates of this kind must largely be a  matter of guess-work, an examination of the data  upon which the Childers Reponwas founded shows that they are  in many z-espects fallacious andthe general conclusion drawn by the United Kingdom  Representa-tives is  that taking  the whole  period from the date of the Unionuntil the present time, it would be impossible to establish any clearproof  that Ireland has been over-taxed at all.            2. Abandonment of  the Gold Standard.  Compensation is claimed for the &quot; loss  sustained by Irish FreeState  interests &quot;  in  consequence of the abandonment of the goldstandard.  In  the  view  of the United  Kingdom Representativesthe abandonment of  the gold standard involved no loss to the FreeState  as a whole,  but rather a  profit.  The liabilities of the FreeState  and  its  nationals  are  for the  most part sterling liabilitieswhich were reduced  in gold  value in the same proportion as their sterling assets.   The abandonment  of the gold standard has proved a means of reducing the disequilibrium between prices  and costs.and those parts of the world which have abandoned the gold standardhave suffered from the economic depression to a less extreme degreethan those countries which have attempted to cling to it.  But even if there  had been a loss, no claim against the  UnitedKingdom could be admitted.  The Gold Standard Act was domesticlegislation which the United Kingdom Government were entitledto amend when external circumstances compelled them to do so.  Other claims for compensation  on this account have  from timeto time been put forward  but they have in no case been acceptedby the United  Kingdom  Government.
(&apos;?                       3. Road Fund.   It is agreed that the Irish Free State are entitled to a share of the Road  Fund.   The  dispute is as  to  the method of apportion- inent; the Irish Free State claimed that the past decisions of the lioad Board as to  allocation of grants had been unfair and should he retrospectively revised, but the Treasury regard this as inadmis- sible.   It had already been agreed to submit the question to the arbitra- iidii of Sir Henry Strakosch.                          4. Coinage.   This question was settled in 1929 by an agreement between the Government of the Irish Free State and  the  United  Kingdom Gov- erumeiit, by  which,  as a concession,  the  latter agreed to redeem United Kingdom silver to the face value of  750,000 in agreed instal- meiits at  present  amounting to   60,000  a year and  continuing until 1939.  The question is,  therefore, in the view of the United Kingdom Government, settled by a  binding agreement and it is understood that the  binding  character  of the agreement is not (untested.   There  is no  legal  basis for a claim that the  United Kingdom Government are liable to  redeem all British  Token  Coinage in the Irish Free State rendered redundant in the Free State by the issue of the National Coinage there.                          5. Currency.   The claim of the Irish  Free State  is stated as being  to the full amount of the profits derived from the circulation of British  Notes between  1st April, 1922,  when the Irish  Free State  was set up, and 9th September, 1928, when the new Irish Free State note issues were introduced.   It  is understood that the intention is to  claim a  share  in  such profits corresponding to the notes circulating in Ireland,  including  those held by Irish Banks to cover their note circulation in the Irish Free State  area.   The continued circulation of British Notes was a measure decided on  by the  Free State Government for their own convenience,  it is always open to a Territory to obtain the profits of note issue by issuing its  own notes, but it is in the  view of the United Kingdom tiovernment unjustifiable  that the  responsibility for a  note  issue should fall  exclusively on them,  and the profits be  shared  with others.         6. National Teachers&apos; Pension  Fund Deficit.   It is understood  that this is a moral claim  based on the fact that the Fund  was found in 1926 to have been  in deficit at the date of transfer in 1922.   Tn  accordance with the general  principles on which  functions were transferred, the  Irish Free State took over both the assets in
question,  and the corresponding liabilities, in the state in  whi S)they existed at the  date  of  transfer, and  the United kingdom representatives consider that this general principle must govern the present case.                  7. Other Claims and Items.  (a) National Health Insurance (Women&apos;s  Equalization) Fund.The Free  State claim a portion of the  moneys ( 290,000)  in  theFund on the 1st April, 1922.  The Fund was, however, wound upretrospectively from  the  1st  January,  1922,  and the  moneys inquestion were  surrendered to the  British Exchequer.   The claim is regarded as  inadmissible on the ground  that the  sums weresurrenderable voted  sums and  not a non-surrenderable  grant-in-aid transferable to the Irish Free State.   (b) Receipts under certain  Articles of the Peace Treaties which deal with  Ex-enemy  Debts and Properties. Under an agreement reached in April, 1925, the Free  State undertook to  make itselfresponsible for the  collection  of debts  from  its  nationals  (about 9,000) and to receive as  remuneration for  their services commis-sion and  interest  on the  proceeds of the liquidation of ex-enemy property in the Irish Free State.  The  Free State subsequentlyexpressed  the view  that  their receipts would be  insufficient  tocover  any  loss to the Free  State on  account of bad debts, lotwhich the Free State  would be responsible under the agreement to  the Clearing Office.  It is understood that the validity of theagreement of 1925 is not  contested, but  that a further discussion is desired. To this  the  United Kingdom  Representatives  would readily agree.   (c) Quit Rents. The point  at issue  here, of which  the  UnitedKingdoin  Government were already aware, is whether the Crownrevenues  from  quit  rents should  have  been  payable to  the FreeState from the 1st April, 1922, or from the  6th December, 1922 (the latter date being  that on  which the Free State  Constitutioncame into force).  The United Kingdom Government have been advised in favour of the latter date and  it  is on the basis of this advice that  the United Kingdom Government have retained therevenue at stake, which amounts to a few thousand  pounds.   The  Irish  Free State  Government  now raise the  fresh point that the  sums received in respect of the redemption of quit rent;in Ireland since 1891 ought not to have been  invested in England.but should have been invested in  landed property in Ireland, and that  in  that  case the Irish  Free State  Government  would havehad the benefit.  The United  Kingdom Government are unaware of any justification for the view that the. rents should have  been so invested  and there  seems to  be no ground for attempting to go back retrospectively  on past  actions in this way, or for departing in this instance from the general rule  by which the actual assets at the date of transfer were banded over.
;  (d)  Dead  Notes. When  the  Irish Free State introduced  theirown currency notes  in 1928 the necessity  for legislating afresh onthe matter raised the question of notes which had been outstandingso long that they  might  be regarded as lost and as never likelyto he  presented.  The allocation of the value of these notes, whenwritten off,  between the  two Governments might well form thesubject of further discussion.  (e)  Post Office Dormant Accounts. The Irish Free &quot;State  re-ceived a share of the assets (as on 1st April, 1923) of the BritishPost  Office  Savings Bank proportionate  to  the  accounts  trans-ferred by depositors to the new Irish Savings Bank.  Since  dormantaccounts were not so transferred, no part of the balances of suchaccounts were transferred to the Free  State.  As the liability  forthese  accounts remains with the United Kingdom  Government itwas of course not  possible to agree  to  the transfer of any part  ofthe balances without the consent of the  depositors or their legalrepresentatives.  Subject,  to such consent, no  objection would beraised.  (f)  Death  Duties. This proposal,  the consideration of  which involves a review of the arrangements for relief from double incometax, has already been the  subject of correspondence between thetwo Governments.   On 24th February, 1932, the Board of InlandRevenue wrote to the  Revenue Commissioners,  Dublin, suggestingan  early meeting in London  for a  full discussion  on outstanding points of difficulty arising out  of the double taxation arrangements.No action has yet been taken by the Irish Free State Governmentto open these discussions.  The United Kingdom Representativesconfirm their  willingness  for such a discussion to take place.  October nth, 1932.
MEMORANDUM OF IRISH FREE  STATE REPRE sent a-    TIVES  IN  REPLY  TO  MEMORANDA  CONTAINING    BRITISH OBSERVATIONS.(Forwarded by Mr.  de Valera under date 26i/i October, 1932.)               1.-Instruments of  1923 and 1926.  The Representatives  of  the  Irish Free  State deny that either the Financial Agreement of 12th February,  1923,  or the  Headsof the Ultimate Financial Settlement of 19th March, 1926, whichform  the main basis of  the claim advanced by the British G-overn-ment, is binding.   The first of these instruments was admittedlyof a provisional character.   Not merely  was it not ratified  but its terms  were kept secret  from the legislatures of both countries fora period of nine years.  The second instrument, though purporting to be  a final  settlement,  did  not in fact deal with  a number  of items  of prime importance outstanding between  the two  States.such as the claim of the Irish Free State for compensation for over-taxation in the period prior to the Treaty.  It also was not ratified by the legislature of either State, and its terms were not disclosedfor a  period of eight months after the date  of signature.  There was a stipulation for  ratification in  the  Treaty of 1921.and a similar  condition must  be implied  in any  instrument in-tended to  amend, extend, or abridge its tex-ms.  The instruments of 1923  and  1926 purported  to  modify in  a number of waysprejudicial to  the  Irish Free  State the  financial arrangementsprovided for in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, in the  Treatyof 1921, and in the  Agreement of 1925 amending the Treaty.  TheBritish Government has nowhere explained  why, if these  instru-ments were intended by both  Governments to operate  and rank-as binding international agreements, the same practice was notfollowed in relation to  them as in  the  case of those agreements for  the amendment or  variation of the Treaty which both sidesagree  were intended to be definitely binding.  The Irish Free State Representatives cannot admit that agree-ments between Governments on matters of major importance arebinding until  they have been ratified.  Ratification has  becomerequisite by usage and is recognized by leading authorities on inter-national law to be part of the positive law of nations.  In the caseof agreements which impose a charge on the revenues of the state the necessity for Parliamentary approval is universally  accepted.and such  approval  is required  by the established practice  of theIrish  Free State.
C                2.-Land Purchase Annuities.    The legal claim of the Irish Free State to retain these annuities  is based  on the following considerations.  They  were ceded  to  Southern Ireland by virtue of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,  under which Ireland was relieved of all liability for the service of  Irish Land  Stock.   The Government of the Irish Free State does  not  understand how the objections of the Irish people to  the Act  of 1920  can affect  the legal question as  to whether the  relevant  provisions of the Act were the  law of the land or not.  The Treaty  and  the arrangements made for bringing it into operation explicitly  take account of the Government of  Ireland Act,  while the terms  of the Treaty relating to Northern  Ireland provide for  the con-  contingency of  that area remaining in the Free State, in which event  Northern Ireland was  to be freed from the liability for an Imperial  contribution while retaining for its sole use the annuities &quot;  gifted &quot;  under the Act.  It can  hardly be  seriously suggested  that  the  Treaty  contemplated  leaving  the  subordinate   Government  of  Northern Ireland  in possession- of  the annuities collected  in  its  territory while the Government of  all Ireland was to collect  the  annuities in  the  rest  of  the  country merely  for transmission&apos;  to  Great Britain.   Finally, even if  the contention  of the British Representatives  with  regard  to the Government of  Ireland Act  were correct, it  would not establish the British claim.  The Land Stocks being  part  of the  Public  Debt  of the United Kingdom, the Irish Free  State was relieved  of  all  obligation for the  service thereof by  the  Agreement of 3rd December, 1925, amending the  Treaty.   It  is asserted in the British Representatives&apos;  Memorandum of  loth October that the Land Purchase Fund  is the  primary  security  for Irish Land Stocks.  The Irish Land Purchase  Fund was, bow-  ever, before the Treaty, a fund wholly controlled  amd  operated  by  the National Debt Commissioners of  the United Kingdom of Great  Britain and  Ireland,  a statutory body.  The liabilities secured  on  it were liabilities of the United Kingdom, and no reasonable inter-  pretation  of  the term &quot; Public Debt,&quot; as  used  in  Article V of the  Treaty, can exclude them.  Article V was the only Article of the  Treaty which purported to place upon the Irish Free State liability  for any part of the Public Debt of  the  United Kingdom.   The  British Representatives  acknowledge that the Agreement of  3rd  December, 1925, released the  Irish Free State from liability under  Article V.  The contention of the Irish Free State is that the 1925  Agreement placed the obligation to meet  the interest  and sinking  fund  of  Land  Stock finally and exclusively upon Great  Britain.  No misunderstanding  or mistake in  interpretation during  the last  seven years should operate to deprive the Irish Free  State of  its  rights under this Agreement and the ratifying Acts of Parliament.   The assertion of  the British Representatives that the Land Pur-  chase Annuities &quot;  are debts due by the Irish  Free State tenants
to the Land Purchase Fund held by the National Debt Commis-Csioners &quot; is inaccurate.  The liability of a tenant purchaser is a liability to the State and is completely  discharged when he  payshis annuity to the Irish Land Commission.  The reference in the British  Memorandum  of  loth  October tothe provisions of the  Land  Act of 1923 is not  relevant to the dis-pute between the  two Governments.  The Land Act  was passed into law nine years  before the publication  of  the  Agreement of12th February, 1923, and it did not ratify that Agreement, nor didit  even purport to do so.  It was a piece of  purely domestic legis-lation which the Irish Free State is  free to  repeal at any time itchooses.  The deductions to be drawn from the scope  of the phrase &quot; public debt &quot; are a material factor not only in connexion with the LandPurchase  Annuities  but also in connexion  with the  Bonus  andExcess Stock Annuities, the Local  Loans Annuity and the public offices (Site) and other  annuities  mentioned  in Head 7  of theIrish Free  State&apos;s first Memorandum.  The phrase &quot; public debt &quot;is  of  course  a wider term  than  &quot;  national  debt &quot;  which is  usedin the British  Memorandum, but  even s6a  the. references  to the content of &quot; national debt &quot; in the  British  Statutes, so far  fromconfirming the British Governments view that Land  Stocks andLocal Loans Stock are not comprehended therein,  support the con-tention of the Government of the Irish Free  State that  no materialdistinction was drawn or intended  between these and other formsof State debt.   The  practice of the British Treasury in  setting out these Stocks in the published accounts is not and has not beenuniform; but, in so far as it can be  made the  basis of argument.it  goes to show  that  they have been  treated as part of the public debt.  The  British  Finance  Accounts in dealing with  the  pay-ments for management of the debt  have for  many years contained a list under  the heading  &quot;  Unredeemed Public Debt,&quot; which in-cludes Local Loans Stock and the Irish Land Stocks.   In addition  should be noted that  Local Loans were,  prior to 1887, issueddirectly from the Exchequer, the corresponding debt  being directState debt.  The creation of a- separate  account  financed  by theissue of a special local loans stock arose from certain considerations of financial technique aiming at a  more  orderly regulation of the debt service, but it  did not  alter  the essential  character of the debt created.  The Irish Land Act, 1891, provided that the Guaran-teed Land Stock could be exchanged on demand for consolidatedannuities  (Consols),  a provision that is clearly inconsistent  withthe suggestion  that  Land  Stock  is of  a different nature  fromConsols.  Proposals were advanced from time to time by  BritishGovernment  officials  that Irish  land  purchase should be financed by the creation of further debt taking the same forms as existingdebt,  and  not by special land stocks,  a clear proof that  no materialdistinction  was recognized between land stocks and the proposed
C.bstitutes.   The  argument  drawn  from the  fact  that  the Con-solidated Fund of  the United Kingdom merely guarantees the ser-vice  of  the  Stock is  invalid because  it ignores the consideration that  the primary  security is a State fund  and that no primaryliability rests on any external debtor.  The obligation of the state to the lender is the decisive circumstance, and  by that the IrishLand Stocks, the  borrowed capital of  the Local  Loans Fund, andthe outstanding capital sums due on  the  other  annuities claimedare within the category of &quot; Public Debt.&quot;   From  the  foregoing  it  will be  seen  that there is nothing inestablished administrative practice or in the principles of financialprocedure to  indicate  that  the  content of &quot; public debt &quot; depends on the use made  of the borrowed money or on the existence ornon-existence of tangible.assets, whether revenue-producing or not,or on any details of accounting mechanism.  The statement in the  Irish Free  State Representatives&apos; Memo-raiidum of 12th October that, in view of all the historical circum-stanees, it is inequitable that  the Irish people  should  be obligedto pay the Land  Purchase Annuities to Great  Britain  must not he taken as  based solely  on  Ireland&apos;s counterclaims  for over-taxation  in the past.  It has  particular  reference  to the circum-stances  surrounding the confiscation and tenure of Irish land.             3. Bonus and Excess Stock Annuities.  Bonus and Excess  Stock is  not distinguished in any way fromLand Stock in general.   The British Government admits generallyits liability for the service of Bonus and Excess Stock,  but claimsa contribution in respect thereof from the Government of the IrishFree  State.   The  Public  Debt argument,  already  cited, applieshere  with special  force.  It cannot  be denied that the Bonus andExcess Stock was a direct liability of the United Kingdom.             4. R.I.C. Judicial and Civil Pensions.  The Article  of  Agreement for  a Treaty placed upon the IrishFree State a specific liability to pay &quot; fair compensation .... tojudges,  officials, members of police forces,  and other public ser-vants who are discharged by.it or who retire in consequence ofthe change of government,&quot; subject to certain  defined exceptions.  No members  of the  Royal Irish Constabulary were  discharged by the Irish Free State or  retired in consequence of the changeof government.  The force never  came under the  authority ofthe  Irish Free State  Government;  it  was  demobilized by theBritish  Govennment, and the  circumstances in which  the IrishFree State would  have been liable for R.I.C. pensions never arose.The  British  Delegation^  argument based  on the  assent  of theProvisional  Government  and  the disbandment of  the  R.I.C.  isclearly  invalid.   The  Provisional  Government  had no  power to
vary the terms of the Treaty.  The Heads of Working Arrang0ments for Implementing the Treaty, in which the assent is implied.cannot  be regarded as  a document  co-ordinate  with  or  in any respect  superseding the  Treaty, and in any event it did not pur-port to alter the condition attached to the Irish Free State&apos;s liability under Article X  of  the Treaty.  No &quot; corollary &quot;  to  transfer  ofGovernment  and  no handing over departments  as   &quot;  going con-cerns &quot;  can be called  in aid  to superimpose new  liabilities wherethe Treaty expressly declares what liabilities  the  parties intendedto attach to the new State.  As regards judicial pensions the Eepresentatives of  the Irish FreeState feel that the contentions in paragraph 5 of their first Memo-randum  have not been  answered.   The  salaries  and pensions  of judges  were charged upon the Consolidated Fund and cannot  betreated   as   &quot; Departmental   Salaries &quot;   or  as   &quot; DepartmentalPensions.&quot;  The civil  pensions in  dispute are  pensions payable to public ser-vants who retired before the  change of government.  There is  no provision of  the  Treaty which purports  to make the  Trish  FreeState liable  for them with the  arguable  exception  of  the public debt provision in Article V,  subsequently cancelled.  Apart from the release from liability for  E.I.C. pensions resultingfrom  the demobilization of the force by  the British Government.the Irish Free State  has an  indisputable case in justice against this burden.   The E.I.C. was admittedly  an Imperial force, whose main function was &quot;the  maintenance of British rule  in  Ireland; itwas far greater in numbers and in cost than was necessary for the fulfilment of  normal police duties.   It  is, therefore, manifestlyunjust that Ireland should be saddled with the entire expense ofpensioning the force on its disbandment.                  5. The Local Loans Annuity.  The British Delegation states that the primary security for local loans Stock is the Local Loans Fund, but this fund, like the LandPurchase Fund, is a State fund and its liabilities are State liabilities.The Irish Free State  Eepresentatives are advised accordingly thatthe Stock is part of the  Public Debt referred to in Article V  of theTreaty, and that  the Irish Free State was released from all liability in respect of it by the Agreement of 1925.  In  this connexion, the Irish Free  State  Eepresentatives  depre-cate attempts to rebut  arguments based on legal and  moral rightby  reference to the mere book-keeping arrangement by which cer-tain funds are regarded  as the security for loans contracted by theUnited Kingdom.  Local Loans Stock and Land Stock were Stocksissued by the Government of the United  Kingdom,  and the book-keeping procedure devised to deal with them  in no  way alters thefact that they were part of the Public Debt of the  United kingdom on  6th  December, 1921.
O           6. Public Offices (Site), etc., Annuities.   These  annuities do  not represent repayment of  &quot; advances.&quot; The moneys in question were in no  sense loans; they were grants of public moneys of Great Britain and Ireland, granted for national purposes.  They were  never made  departmental liabilities.  The original  grants  were made, appropriately, from the Consolidated Fund ; repayments were charged on voted moneys and to the extent that these were insufficient were charged on the Consolidated Fund. Tho provision for &quot; repayment &quot; of these capital moneys by annual instalments  was a mere  book-keeping  arrangement  for  Treasury purposes.    There was no charge on the property  in respect of which the grants were made; there  was no lender, and there was no borrower.  These were capital payments out of public money and the  service of the debt thereby created in the books of the late United Kingdom was in the  view of the Government of  the Irish Free State clearly Public Debt for its share of which the Irish Free State would have had to account under Article V of the Treaty, had that liability not been cancelled in 1925.   These capital  liabilities  are, it is hardly necessary to  add, recog- nised as being comprised under the category  of  &quot; National Debt &quot; in official British returns and in the standard works on the subject.              7. Claim in Respect of Overtaxation.   The people of Ireland will learn with surprise that  it is seriously contended by the Representatives of the British Government that &quot; it was fundamental that there was no question of Ireland receiv- ing money &quot; under Article V of the  Treaty.   In the  negotiations which preceded the Treaty it was made clear that Ireland had a claim  against  Great Britain  in respect of over- taxation  during the  period  from the Act of Union up  to  1921, and Article  V  of  the Treaty  accordingly provided  for  the con- sideration of this  counterclaim.  The liability  of  the  Irish Free State under that Article  was abrogated by  the amending Agree- ment of 1925, but  the  counterclaim  did not come up for  examina- lion; it was  not waived nor withdrawn as part of the consideration lor  that  Agreement.   As long as any payments from the Irish Free State are claimed by the British Government, it is contended by the Government of  the Irish Free State that this counterclaim must be taken into  consideration and  satisfied.   The Financial Articles  of  the Act of Union  contemplated that Cheat  Britain and Ireland  would continue  as separate  financial entities even if  their exchequers were  to be amalgamated.  The Act provided that  at the end  of not more than every  20 years the  Irish contribution  to joint expenditure  should be revised in the  light of the  country&apos;s taxable capacity.   These revisions never took place and  the ratio of contribution  determined for the initial period for Ireland, namely  two-seventeenths, proved entirely be- yond the capacity  of the  country, especially having  regard to the
rapid expansion in United Kingdom.expenditure after the Unioi  )At the time of the Act of Union  the revenue of Ireland  amountedto about   3,000,000 per annum, while the average for the  fiveyears 1811-12 to 1815-16 was  5,927,424; the total revenue collected from 1801  to  1817  amounted to   77,814,194,  the overtaxationbeing not less  than  30,000,000.   The British Royal  commission which in  1893-94 investigated the  position estimated  the amountof overtaxation for that year at  3,000,000  (in Mr. Childers&apos; draft 2,250,000), and there is statistical evidence  that there had beenovertaxation on  this scale for a considerable  period  and that itcontinued up to 1914.  Overtaxation from 1914 to the Treaty  wason a much higher scale.  These figures  are of course all-Irelandfigures, but in considering the particular claim of the Irish FreeState regard  should be  had  to  the fact that  the  relative over-taxation pressed with greater severity on the predominantly agricui-tural portion of the country.                       8. Gold  Standard.  It is  not denied that the  British Government is legally entitledto amend the Gold Standard Act, but  the  Government  of  theIrish Free State considers that it has  a moral claim to compensa-tion for any injury to Irish Free State  interests that may be causedthereby, particularly in so far as such injury arises from  invest-ments in British Government securities.  The assets in sterlingof the Irish Free State and its nationals exceeded their liabilitiesin&apos;sterling, and the reduction in the value  of sterling  caused aconsiderable loss on balance.                         9. Road Fund.  The existing agreement to  submit  this question to arbitrationis, of course, accepted.  The  item was included as it was under-stood that the purpose of the negotiations was to  secure a com-prehensive  financial settlement  covering all  matters outstandingbetween the two countries.                       10. Token Coinage.   The  existing arrangement  under which coins  to the value of 750,000 in the aggregate are to be redeemed by 1939 is not  heredisputed.  The issue was raised to  ascertain the views  of  theBritish Government regarding the disposal of the balance of Britishcoins circulating in the Irish Free State at the end  of that period.It is not suggested that there  is  a  strictly  legal basis for theliability of the United Kingdom Government with regard  to itscoinage,  but  the  fact  cannot be  overlooked that  British  token coinage  circulating  in Australia  and in  South Africa  was, in similar circumstances, redeemed by  the British  Mint.
W        &apos;               II-1 Currency.     11  .&apos;   It is the view of the Government  of the Irish Free State that its claim to the profits from its note issue should not be prejudiced by the fact that the machinery of note  issue which formerly operated for  the  United Kingdom as a  whole  necessarily remained  with the British  Government  for a period following the transfer of functions.  On 27th February,  1929, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer  admitted that &quot; a substantial profit was made by the British  Exchequer  during  this period from their circulation in [reland &quot;  (i.e., the  circulation  of  British Treasury Notes).    In any comprehensive settlement this matter should surely be brought up for consideration.          12. National Teachers&apos;  Pension Fund Deficit.   The deficit in this case was largely caused  by an administrative act  of the British Government at a time when legislation to pro- vide separate legislatures and exchequers for Ireland had  already been passed.   The magnitude of the  deficit which this administra- tive act  caused could not be ascertained  for  some  time  after the transfer  of  the Fund, the  necessary actuarial  investigation  prior to the change of government having  been deferred.  The position of  this Fund should be  taken  into  consideration  in arriving at any comprehensive  financial settlement. 13. National Health  Insurance (Women&apos;s Equalization) Fund.   The right of the British Government to  wind up this Fund fetro- respecively and to transfer  its assets  to the  British  Exchequer is contested.  The Fund was  managed  by a joint committee acting on behalf of  both Governments.  As late as  the  end of 1922 the Committee recognized its international character by making a grant of  6,000 to the Irish Trustees in furtherance.of the object for which the  Fund was established. 14. Receipts under certain Articles  of the Peace Treaties which           deal with Ex-Enemy Debts and Properties.   It is noted  that the United Kingdom Representatives agree that further discussion on this matter is desirable.                         15.-Quit Rents.   In connexion with this claim it will be  admitted that these rents are  payable to the State by virtue of  the  fact that they accrued to the  Crown, and, in  the case of  Quit Rents in the area of the  Irish Free State, the Government of the  Irish Free  State claims that constitutionally they should form part of  its public revenue.  The receipts   from  Escheated   Estates,  which  are  Crown  revenue analogous to  the  Quit Bents, were transferred to the Irish  Free State as from 1st April, 1922.
  The Government  of the Irish Free State also considers that v )has  a strong claim  to  the capital  sum  secured by  the  UnitedKingdom Government prior to  1st April,  1922,  from the redemp-tion of Quit Rents in the area of the Irish Free State.   This capital sum can be traced among the assets secured by the British Govern-ment at the separation, and the revenue therefrom now  accruesto the benefit of the  British Exchequer.  It is considered that  thecapital sum secured  from Quit Rents and other Crown revenues ofthis  character should be treated as any other joint Fund and shouldbe equitably apportioned between the two Governments, the shareof the Irish Free State being the full sum received from Quit Rentsredeemed in the area of the Irish Free State, less any assets in theIrish Free State created out of it.                        16. Dead Notes.  The Government of the Irish Free State  concurs  with the viewthat the settlement  of the matter of Dead Notes might form  thesubject of further discussion.               17. Post Office Dormant Accounts.  The difficulty in this case arises from the fact that the british treasury feel unable to  transfer any account without  the consentof the depositors or  their legal  representatives.   In  the  case ofdormant accounts no such consent will ex hypothesi be forthcoming.but the Government  of the Irish Free State takes the  view that itshould not for this reason be deprived of the assets latent in theseaccounts.  Without  any violation of the principles  laid down bythe Treasury regarding the transfer of accounts it would be possibleto satisfy the equitable claims of the Government of the Irish FreeState by a payment or credit of the appropriate sum from the british exchequer, subject,  of course, to suitable guarantees of repaymentin the event of any dormant account being drawn on or reclaimed.                      18. Death Duties.  This item was raised  so that  it.might be covered by the coni-prehensive financial  settlement which was the object of the  nego-tiations.   It is noted that the British Government is  prepared todiscuss the  outstanding points of difficulty in the existing  double-taxation  arrangements, and the Government of the Irish Free Stateconcurs.U8799-3) Wt. llflP2-29i(l 250O 10/52 P.
