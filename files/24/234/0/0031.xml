909K*     The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.                           NOVEMBER 17, 1932.MY LORDS  AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE  OF COMMONS,    THE admission of the Kingdom of Iraq to  membership of the League ofNations as a fully independent sovereign State marks the successful issue of thepolicy which My Government and their predecessors have consistently pursuedduring the last twelve years.    At the Lausanne Conference held in the summer the Governments concernedcollaborated with success in devising the conditions of a lasting settlement of thequestion of  German reparations  as an essential  preliminary to  the economic recovery of the world.    I am deeply gratified at the successful cqnclusion of the Economic Conferenceheld at Ottawa  between representatives of  the^Governments of the different partsof My Empire, and I trust  that it will  add strength to the ties  between my peoples  and stimulate  imperial  trade.    I have  given My  assent to theMeasure necessary to give effect in the United Kingdom to the recommendationsof the Conference.    I  regret that  certain questions which have  arisen between the UnitedKingdom and the  Irish Free State have not yet.  despite the  efforts made, beenfound capable of adjustment.    In  accordance with the Resolutions  approved by both  your  Houses, my ministers have  been investigating the many difficult  questions involved in the revision of the  Indian  Constitution, and they have removed a serious barrier  toprogress by issuing a Declaration on the subject of communal representation.MEMBERS OF THE  HOUSE OF  COMMONS,    I thank you for the provision, you have made for the public serviceMY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    The measures taken to meet  the crisis of last autumn and the readiness  ofthe community  to make all necessary sacrifices have succeeded in re-establishing a balance between income and expenditure in our national finances.    Within the last few months operations on a  scale never hitherto attemptedhave been carried through with complete success for the purpose of reducing thecharge to the public for the service  of the  National Debt.    The adverse balance of trade which occasioned so much anxiety last year hasbeen checked by the passing of the Import Duties  Act and a substantial additionto the Revenue  has been obtained by the same means, while a reasonable protectionhas been afforded  to British industry on  the recommendations of an impartialadvisory committee.    Since the passing of this Act approaches have been made to My Government,by the  Governments of a number  of foreign countries,  with a  view to  the negotiation of  trade agreements.  My Ministers  welcome these  approaches andconversations have already begun which will, I trust, lead to mutually satisfactory arrangements.     The  condition of  the  agricultural  industry has  received  the  anxiousconsideration of My Ministers.   The serious position in the  live-stock industry has demanded emergency measures  and a scheme  for the voluntary regulation ofimports of meat into this country is now  being brought into  operation with theco-operation of the Governments and commercial  interests in  the Dominions andforeign countries concerned.   I am gratified to learn that this co-operation hasbeen so readily  forthcoming.                                                                    (7S30.
     I have given My assent to a Measure for the assistance of growers of wheat in this country, and provision has been made for the protection and encouragement of the fruit growing and market gardening industries.     An  Act  of  great  constitutional  significance, namely,  the  Statute  of westminster, 1931, which makes clear the powers of Dominion Parliaments, hasbeen passed.  This Act gives effect to certain resolutions passed by the imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930 setting out the relationship of the United Kingdomand the Dominions.     I have given My assent to a Bill laying down the rules to be observed withregard to certain matters in the assessment  of transitional  payments  to theunemployed, and enabling the same rules to be applied to outdoor relief.     A Measure has been passed consolidating and amending the.law of town planning, whereby the responsible authorities will in future be enabled, subjectto due consideration of all interests concerned, to study and deal with  problems ofdevelopment in relation to areas, whether built up or not.     A number of  other  Measures of  public  utility have been added  to theStatute Book.     On the  advice of My Ministers  I have appointed a Commission to enquire into the  existing law and the practice  thereunder relating to lotteries, betting,gambling and cognate matters, and to report what changes, if any, are desirable and practicable.     In bidding you farewell, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
