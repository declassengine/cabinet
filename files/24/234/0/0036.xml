 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT          v        Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1932.MOST  SECRET.CP. 387 (32).                               CABINET.DISARMAMENT.   FORM OF DECLARATION  ON GERMANY&apos;S  CLAIM TO  EQUALITY  OF RIGHTS.      (As approved by the Cabinet at their Meeting on November 9, 1932.)     IN dealing- with the claim to equality of rights in the matter of armamentsraised by the German Government in their Note of the 29th August, 1932, it isnecessary to insist that the main purpose of disarmament is to ensure a lasting-peace.  The limitations contained in Part V of  the Treaty of Versailles were imposed as a means of securing, in the circumstances then prevailing,  the peace of Europe. It is undoubtedly true that these limitations were intended to be, and expressed to  be,  the precursor  of the general  limitation of armaments.   TheUnited Kingdom Government feel under  no reproach in this regard, as  theircountry  has in recent years  effected  immense reductions.  But  now,  when anagreement between the nations of the world for the reduction and limitation ofarmaments is being negotiated, Germany claims that the methods of limitationapplied to her should no longer be different from those applied to other nations,and the United Kingdom Government have throughout been ready and anxious tojoin the  other Governments represented  at Geneva  (including  Germany) in framing a Disarmament Convention which would fairly meet this claim.    Any hesitation which might arise in any quarter would not proceed from a desire to inflict  upon  Germany a permanent  inferiority  of status.   It wouldspring from anxiety as to the use which might be made of the new situation andfrom fear of the resulting dangers which might threaten the tranquillity of Europe,This anxiety may be ill-founded, but the  United Kingdom Government would strongly urge that it is nevertheless the highest wisdom to endeavour to remove it.The United Kingdom Government therefore suggest that, side by side with themeeting of Germany&apos;s claim to equality of status in the  manner set out below, all european States should join  in  a solemn affirmation that they will not in any circumstances attempt to resolve any  present or  future  differences between themby  resort to  force.  The world is  entitled to this  specific  assurance.  The-acknowledgment by others of Germany&apos;s  moral right to  parity of treatment withother nations entails upon  Germany, along with others, the acceptance of this-corresponding obligation.                                 *.    On the assumption  that such an  assurance is given, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient in the United Kingdom consider that the German claim to equality of rightsshould be fully met in the following manner :       (i) The limitations on Germany&apos;s  armaments should  be contained in  the-          same Disarmament Convention  as that which wijl define the liniita-          tions on the armaments of others; that is to say, the articles in Part V          of the  Treaty of Versailles which at present limit Germany&apos;s arms          and armed forces  would be superseded,  and Germany&apos;s limitations          would  be arrived at  by the same process and expressed in&quot; the same          document as those of all other  countries.     (ii) The newly-expressed limitations in the case of Germany  would last for          the same period, and be subject to the same methods  of revision  as          those of all other countries.[7809A]
    (iii) Germany has declared that she has no intention of rearmuOg and that           she merely desires that the principle should be acknowledged that the           kinds of arms permitted to other countries ought not to be prohibited           to herself.  If equality of status is to be conceded, this principle must           be acknowledged, and &quot;the United Kingdom Government hereby declare           their  willingness,  in co-operation  with the other members of  the           Disarmament Conference, to see it embodied in the new convention.           By what means and by what stages this principle can be applied must           be  the subject of a detailed discussion at Geneva, in which it is essen-           tial that Germany should join.   In the meantime, the United Kingdom           Government wish to emphasise two points.   First, the object of the           Disarmament Conference is  to bring about the maximum of positive           disarmament that can be generally agreed not to authorise in the           name of equality the increase of armed strength.  Secondly, the full           realisation, in practice, of the principle of equality  cannot be achieved           all at once.  Confidence in the further application of the principle           will grow as it is seen that the peace of the world has been made more           secure by taking the first step.    The United Kingdom  Government,           therefore,  conceive that what is needed is a practical programme of           stages, each subsequent step being justified and  prepared for by the           proved consequence of what has gone  before.    Similar principles should be applied and similar methods should be adopted for arriving at and expressing the limitations which will apply to the armamentsof Austria,&quot;Hungary and Bulgaria.ANNEX.  Explanatory Note showing  how effect might be  given  to Point (iii) of  the                             Draft Declaration.    THE completion in its entirety of a scheme based on the above  principlesmust necessarily occupy some  time.  Both practical and political considerations are involved.  The conditions  of the different nations in the matter of armamentsvary widely according to their geographical situation and the responsibilities inrespect of which their armed  forces are required.   For example, the needs of a nation with  world-wide oversea responsibilities must  differ considerably fromthose of a  self-contained Continental Power.  To equate these varying circum-stances is no easy task.  Moreover, economic considerations cannot be disregarded.Following the precedent of the  Naval Treaties, time must be allowed to spread the cost of  replacement where a natioirs armaments have to  be  adjusted to a lower qualitative standard.  The final result, therefore, can only  be reached by stages.   The immediate task  of the Disarmament  Conference is  to  settle  theactual programme of the first stage and, if possible, to establish the main outlinesof the second stage, in order  that nations may adjust their programmes theretoin the interval.  So&apos;far as the political difficulties are concerned, a few years ofgood neighbourly conduct during this interval will do much to prepare  the way for the second stage.    In the light of these observations His Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatthe following methods might be applied in the first stage :                         (A)-Qualitative Disarmament.&apos;(1) Naval Armaments.     (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government are at present engaged in seeking  agreementwith the leading Naval Powers for substantial reduction in the size of the capital ship, and the principle of according to Germany equality of rights demands thatGermany should be permitted  to build ships of a type similar to that upon whichthe Great Naval PoAvers shall  finally agree.   Exhaustive investigation has shownthat the arbitrary figure of 10,000 tons as the limit of a capital ship would fail
 to command-.general acceptance.  The principle, however, that, the reorganisation of Germany&apos;s fighting forces must be carried out in such a way as not to conflict with the limitation and reduction of armaments requires that any construction undertaken by Germany shall,  subject to minor adjustments, not increase the total tonnage in any category to which her Navy is at present restricted.     (b) His Majesty&apos;a  Government have  already expressed their  willingness to limit cruisers to vessels of  7,000 tons, mounting (5-inch guns, a limit closely approximating to the limit now imposed  upon Germany.     (c) His majesty&apos;s  Government  have  repeatedly  urged  that  the submarine should be wholly abolished.  They regard this as one of the greatest contributions that can be made to disarmament  and world peace, and incidentally as the best way of meeting Germany&apos;s  claims to equality of treatment  in  regard to this weapon. (2)  Land Armaments.     (a) Tanks. The large tanks which were used in the  war were unquestionably offensive weapons, that is to say their  primary purpose was to break clown and force a way through elaborately  prepared  positions.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are in entire agreement with  the proposals recently made on behalf of the United States Government  in  desiring that  specifically  offensive  weapons should be prohibited.   But the modern tank  of a  lighter type  performs  an essentially different function  and cannot  be  regarded  as  an  offensive   weapon.   Its comparatively light armour and its reduced capacity for crossing trenches render it unsuitable for the assault of highly organised defences.   It furnishes an absolutely necessary protection against machine-gun fire and  automatic  rifle fire and, in a small voluntarily enlisted  army like our own, constitutes an essential compensation for lack of numbers and  a protection to human life which it would be impossible to  surrender.   Indeed  a universal  prohibition would inevitably involve, as  far as this  country is  concerned  in view  of its world-wide respon- sibilities, an increase in our present land forces in terms  of man power and would thus, as a measure of disarmament, tend to defeat its own ends.  His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore propose that, at  any rate as a first stage, all tanks should be abolished above a given weight, and that the weight should be fixed with a view to prohibiting those tanks which are specially suitable for offensive employment in battle.  The admission of  equal treatment would make  it impossible  to deny. in principle, to Germany the right to possess  a limited number of such weapons, but the question whether this should be so in practice, and. if so, what number would be sufficient, depends  upon  a  consideration  of  the  purposes to be served by each national army.  In any case,  the point is one for negotiation and not for decision in  advance of discussions at  Geneva in which  Germany would take  part.     (b)  Large  Mobile  Land  Guns.-Under  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  themaximum   calibre   of   large  mobile   guns  permitted    to   Germany  is105  millim.  This  figure   is  obviously   intended   to limit these  guns  toa  type  which  is  suited  for  operations  of defence.   Examples   of   this type  vary   slightly  in   different  armies,   for example,  the  British  4-5-inchgun, which  just exceeds 105 millim. in diameter, is  of the  same type.   the obvious way of  according Germany equality of  treatment  in  regard to  this weapon, while at the same time making a great advance  in disarmament,  is topress for a  general  reduction to  this  figure.   Discussions  at Geneva  on thelimitation in size of mobile land guns have tended to revolve round the higher figure of 155 millim.    If,  however,  a  maximum of  about  105 millim.  was fixed by international convention for the future, it would secure that any  replace-ment or new construction of guns should fall  within the  lower  limit.(3) Air Armaments.    There is no aspect of international  disarmament more vitally urgent than theadoption without delay of the most effective measures  to preserve the  civilian population  from the fearful horrors of  bombardment from  the  air.  The  Govern-ment of the  United,Kingdom have  already stated that  they would be prepared togojx^any length, in agreement with other  Powers,  to achieve this  object.---^C^Z-f he proposal that all bombing machines  should be abolished has been made from several quarters, and it has been  claimed that the  world-wide adoption ofthis  proposal would in itself guarantee the  final  abolition of bombing.  This,
                                     4                                    7however, is not  the case, for machines not actually designed for bombing maynevertheless be adapted  and used for that purpose.  What would be involved,therefore, is the entire  abolition, by international agreement, of military  and naval machines  and of  bombing (apart from the use of such machines as arenecessary for police purposes in outlying places), combined with an effective inter-national control  of civil aviation.  The difficulties to be surmounted in achieving,by international agreement, such a programme are evidently very great, but HisMajesty&apos;s Government are anxious to co-operate with the other chief Air powers in a thorough examination into the practicability  of so extensive a scheme.     In spite of world-wide responsibilities, the Royal Air Force stands only fifthin size  to-day,  but Flis Majesty&apos;s Government are,  nevertheless,  prepared,  if other countries will reduce their air forces, to go still further, and they suggestas a practical and immediate measure of disarmament (1) the immediate reduciion-of the air forces  of  the leading Powers  to  the  level  of those  of the UnitedKingdom;  (2) a  cut of 33  per cent, all round on the air forces of the  world thusreduced, United Kingdom included;  (3) a limitation of-the unladen weight  ofmilitary aircraft to  the lowest  figure upon  which general  agreement can  beobtained. The United Kingdom Government propose that the figure thus arrivedat should be subject to a  further reduction at a subsequent stage so as to apply to air disarmament the principle of limitation by stages.  Pending the examinationof the proposals  in the first paragraph of this section. His Majesty&apos;s government think it is not unreasonable that Germany should refrain from making any claimto possess military or  naval aircraft.                       (B) Quan titative Disarmament.     The question of quantitative disarmament is one which will require long and detailed negotiations.   Flere the admission in  principle of Germany&apos;s claim toequality of treatment  and  freedom to readjust her fighting  forces  should  be governed by the condition that readjustment is carried out in such a Avay as  notto conflict with the principle of limitation and reduction of armaments.  That isto say, if Germany wishes, for instance, to be free  from the  prohibition againstcompulsory military service  at present incumbent  on her, the numbers of menannually compulsorily given a militia training in Germany must be deducted, ata ratio to be agreed on, from the numbers  of her long-service  troops. Again,  thereduction of the term of service of these long-service troops, from twelve to  six years, if agreed to, would be conditional on the number of long-service reservesnot being augmented;. i.e., in that case, the number of long-service troops with  thecolours must then be reduced from 100,000 to 50,000.  Elaborate calculations as tothe proper ratios would be required, but the guiding principle must remain, thatis to say,  re-organisation of  the German forces must not  involve increase  ofGermany&apos;s powers of military aggression.     His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are favourably  impressed by the Hoover proposals in  regard to  military effectives, and are prepared toaccept them in principle as constituting a basis for  discussion.                 (C) Disarmament Control and Supervision.     His Majesty&apos;s Government accept in principle the Resolution adopted  bythe General Commission of the Disarmament Conference on the 23rd July on  thesubject  of supervision, that is to  say :  &quot; There shall be set  up  a permanent disarmament  Commission, with  a  constitution, rights and  duties generally as outlined in Part VI of the  Draft Convention  submitted  by  the PreparatoryCommission for the Disarmament Conference, with such extension of its powers as may  be deemed by the Conference necessary to  enable the Convention to be effectively applied.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that it is essentialto the working of the Disarmament ConlwSnce that effective supervision should beprovided for, subject to agreed conditions to be accepted by all States represented at Geneva..
