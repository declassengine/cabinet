The Bacon Industry.             Report of the Lane-Fox Commission.       Memorandum, by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.      1*     As desired by the Cabinet (Conclusion 7(b) Cab ,,53(32)),      I circulate herewith an advance copy of the report of the      Lane-Fox Commission on the Bacon Industry, which will be      published on Tuesday next, October 25th.      2.     The Report contains recommendations of great importance,      and raises issues cf policy on which an early decision of the      Cabinet is desired.      3*     The objective towards which the Commission have      directed their proposals is the improvement of market      stability in the bacon industry and the attainment of a price      equilibrium at a higher level than that which obtains today.      4.     The Commission recommend (Pa^asol7-2Q) that steps sh.or.ld.      be taken to limit the supplies of bacon and hams - imported and      home produced - coming on to the United Kingdom market.  They      advise a limitation of total supplies to 10,670,000 owt. -      the average of the six years 1925-1930 (Para.19).  This, they      advise, should be Imposed as from July 1st next.      5*     Imports would be controlled at the ports and would be      limited by allotting a quota to each exporting country      (Para.17).  It Is recommended that the allocations should, in      normal oireurnstances, be reconsidered annually, and adjusted,      if neoessary, to allow for an increase in the home quota at      the rate of 10 per oent. every four months.  For some years      to come, these increases would represent comparatively small      quantities.
6.     Home supplies (Para. 18) would be controlled at thefactory point and would be limited, during any quota period(a year Is suggested) to a figure determined by the sum totalof the contracts made between producers and curers in respectof that period.       These are the essential principles of the Report.What follows describes the maohinery contemplated forcarrying them into effect.7.     The Administrative Machinery proposed is set out in para.16 of the Report.  It is suggested that a Quota AdvisoryCommittee, analogous in character to the Import duties advisory Committee, should be set up to determine, or makereocmmendations concerning, the periodic read jus the  nt of homeand individual import quotas, and of total supplies.8.     The reoommendations of the Quota Advisory Committeewould be addressed to the appropriate Minisbsr who would beresponsible for making the necessary orders.9.     The Quota Advisory Committee would, in turn, be advisedas regards the home industry by a Pig Industvy development board, and as regards import questions by a bacon. ImportsAdvisory Committee, each body consisting of representativesof the interests concerned.10.    Organisation of the home industry is an essential partof the scheme and the Commission^ proposals hinge on theorganisation of producers and curers under the agricultural marketing Act, 1931.  The Marketing Boards thus establishedwould be co-ordinated by the statutory Pig industry development Board referred to above, composed ofrepresentatives of these Boards with a nucleus of independent members.11.    The functions of the Quota Advisory Committee could, itis suggested, usefully be extended to cover other meats as wellas bacon.  It should be noted, in this connection that no
                                                      61provision ia made in Clause 7 of the Otrtenm-j^gT^ementa -Bill,which deals with the regulation of imports of beef, mutton and lamb for administrative machinery of this kind.  If theCabinet agrees to a Quota Advisory Committee for bacon, thelegislation required could provide for such an extension ofits functions.12.    The Commission considers that the orderly expansionof the pig industry would be facilitated by the establishmentof a Permanent Reorganisation Commission to initiate and examine plans for improving efficiency.13.    The Commission recommends, moreover, that this body should not be limited in its purview to the pig Industry, but should become, in effect, a statutory national planning bodyoonoerned with promoting organisation in agricultural marketing as a whole.  It would thus take the place of tiiead hoc Reorganisation Commissions provided for in theAgricultural Marketing Act of which two have already been setup.   This is a suggestion of far-reaching importance whichwill no doubt attract much attention.  It is not, however,an integral part of the Commission^ bacon proposals.  It isreceiving careful  examination by the agricultural departments, and no decision is required meanwhile.14.    I have endeavoured to confine this memorandum to a                                   JObald statement of the mere importanaa questions raised bythe Report.  A detailed review of some of the Commission^recommendations will be found in the attached Note.15.    In putting this Report before my colleagues, I wouldrecall the following announcement made by the Government onFebruary 11th last:-       &quot;With regard to bacon, the preparation of a soheme  for the organisation of the bacon industry will be under-  taken forthwith, and, provided a feasible and satisfactory  scheme is evolved, the Government will be prepared to J promote some form of quantitative regulation of imports.&quot;
\        This declaration of policy is further emphas&quot;Leed^ in the ottawa Agreements.  (Article 6 of the United Kingdom - CanadaAgreement).16.     Following on the publication of the Report on Tuesdaynext, the Government will undoubtedly be pressed..to announceits intentions.  An early declaration of policy will beexpected, not only by home agriculture but by Canada, wheregreat importance is attached to  the undertaking given by theU.K. delegation on this subject.  Australia and New Zealandare also concerned.17.     I am satisfied that the  proposals put forward by theLane-Fox Commission can be regarded as &quot;a feasible and satisfactory scheme for the organisation of the bacon industry^and in these circumstances, I  ask authority to make anannouncement forthwith that the  Government approves theCommission^ recommendations in  principle, though, of course^reserving its position on points of detail,  I  should be gladalso  to have authority to proceed with the preparation of  adraft Bill, in consultation with the President  of  the Boardof Trade  and with, the Ministers  concerned with agriculture InScotland  and Northern Ireland.

NOTES PIT POINTS IN THE REPORT OP TH3 LANE-POXCOmiSSIOH PIT THE BACON INDUSTRY.Limitation of Total Supplies.     1.   There is a fairly regular 5-^-year cycle in thesupplies of pigs in the chief producing countries;  baconprices accordingly follow a similar but inversa cycle,     2.   In order to provide a stable basis for the orderlyexpansion of our bacon industry, it is necessary to break the price-cycle.     3.   This can only be done by interrupting the supply -cycleand this means limiting the bacon supplies coming on to themarket.     4.   The first effect would be to check the extent to whichbacon prices could fall.   The ultimate effect would be to stabilise home and overseas production for this market and hence to avoid high prices as well.     5.   The Commission recommend that the total volume ofsupplies should be limited to the average of the S years1925-1930, viz. 10,670,000 cwt. of bacon and loamsbeginning from July 1st next.     6.   The supply position is illustrated by the following figures:-The 10.670,000 cwt. figure.Year.Not Importsof Bacon and hams.   _Estimated home production ofBacon and.

     7.   In 1932, to-date, imports have been slightlylarger than in 1931, but a decline appears to be imminent.     8.   The base figure of 10,670,000 cwt. involves areduction in 1931 supplies of 2,638,000 owt. or about 20 percent.   A somewhat smaller percentage is likely to apply in/respect of the 1932 figure.     9.   The anticipated decline in imports will signal the downward turn of the production-cycle.   The full cycle runsover 3  years, the half-cyole about21 months.   The lastprice-trough was December 1931 - February 1932;  a price-peakcan be expected around October 1933.   By July 1st next, thedate reoommended by the Commission for the imposition of restrictions, importation should be approaching its lowestrate,    10.   This prognosis is confirmed by the Danish* pigcensus of July 1932, which showed a fall of 22 per cent, insows, 16 per cent, in young pigs and 10 per cent, in totalpigs compared with July 1931.   Production in most other european countries is tending in the same direction,    11.   Thus, by the middle of next year, the present indications are, that in any event, the rate of importationwill probably have fallen to within measurable distance ofthat required.                   Subsequent Regulation of Imports.    12.   An expansionist home bacon policy based on astabilised total supply necessitates the restriction of imports in corresponding measure to the expansion  of home production.    12.   This is the policy that has always been contemplated in regard to bacon and it  is emphasised in the ottawa agreements.* In 1931, Denmark sent us 7,342,000 cwt,  of bacon and hams  equivalent to over 60 per cent,  of our supplies.   Her  exports have been at an even higher rate in 1932.
                                                         G5     14.  It will mean a gradual further restriction of., the bacon imports initially included in the base total of10,670,000 cwt.   Under the Commission&apos;s proposals, homeexpansion is, however, to be regulated.   If justified by pig-contracts, there will be an expanding home quota, but a maximum rate of expansion is laid down.   It will take at least 2-j? years to double our output, i.e. to increase it from if- million to 3-g-million cwt. or from one-sixth to one-third of the base figure.     15.  The Ottawa Agreement with Canada, under which we are obliged to find room for 2-g million cwt. of Canadian bacon and hams, is also relevant.   As recently as 1925, Canadian suppliesamounted to 1^ million cwt. but nave since declined to a smallfigure.   It seems unlikely that Canada will be able, for sometime, to send us as much as 2,\ million cwt.     16.  The Ottawa Agreements also place us under an obliga-tion to accord preferential treatment to supplies of frozen porkfrom New Zealand and Australia intended for curing here.              Supply-3. imltati on and price-security .     17.  Whether there is any increase in home production(or, indeed,  in Dominion imports) will depend on bacon prices.The Commission proposes that bacon pigs shall be paid for at aminimum price sufficient to cover the production costs of thereasonably efficient farmer.   If bacon prices are favourable,he may receive more, but never less.   With producers thussecured against loss, expansion of home output should follow.     18.  The success of this policy will depend onstabilising bacon prices at a level which will enable curersto pay the minimum price without losing money.   In the exceptional circumstances of the moment, they could not dothi s.     19.  The proposed basic price for pigs would necessitate a price for English smoked bacon of about
98/- pei1 cwt., whereas during the past 2 months  it hasrealised from 80/- to 90/- per cwt.   The proposedlimitation of total bacon and ham supplies to 10,670,000cwt. is designed to stabilise bacon prices at the desiredlevel.     20.  The price of bacon, under the new conditions,cannot, of course, be forecast with certainty.   In  1929,when total bacon supplies were about 10^ million cwt.,  theprice of English bacon was from 130/- to 140/- per cwt;but in view of the decline in purchasing power,  a lower figure is probable when supplies are at the base figure.     21.  In fact, the close correlation between baconsupplies and prices suggests that as supplies fall tothe base figure (which is 20 per cent, lower than atpresent) prices will rise in roughly the same proportion.English bacon would then realise from 100/- to 105/- percwt., which would enable the curers to pay the basicpig price and leave a small margin of profit to both parties.     22.  The proposed basic pig price is in no  sense aState-guaranteed price involving expenditure of  publicfund s .Ministry of Agriculture and        October 20th, 1932.Fisheries.

C.M.G., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Scotland.SIRS,    1.   Terms of Reference. In accordance with Section 15 of theAgricultural Marketing Act, 1931, we were constituted on April 21st,1932, as an Agricultural Marketing Reorganisation Commission forGreat Britain, charged with the duty of preparing, in accordancewith the provisions of the Act,  a scheme  or schemes (applicablein England and  Scotland) for regulating  the marketing of  pigs and any pig products.   Our procedure was governed by the Agri-cultural Marketing  (Reorganisation Commission)  (Great Britain)Regulations, 1932.*   In the course  of preparing any scheme,  we were directed :        (a) to  investigate the extent to  which its operation could    be facilitated by co-operation between the board administering    it and any corresponding body in  Northern Ireland :       (6) to  investigate the manner in which its operation could    be facilitated by the  quantitative  regulation of imports  of    pigs and bacon,f and by similar or different measures affecting    other pig products  ;       (c) to investigate the manner in which such regulation could    best be undertaken in the public  interest;       (d) to  investigate any other matter affecting the operation    of any such  scheme ;  and       (e) to  make recommendations with respect to the matters    investigated.   We have, therefore, not taken into consideration the impositionof duties on imports of  pigs and bacon,  and we have endeavoured to keep within the scope of the Agricultural Marketing Act.  these limitations have added to the complexity  of the scheme which we  *S.R. &amp; O., 1932, No. 609. t We have throughout construed &quot; bacon &quot; as including hams.5188I       REPORT  OF  THE  REORGANISATION  COMMISSION FOR PIGS AND  PIG  PRODUCTS.
propose, and certain suggestions that we make will  necessitateslight amendment to that Act if they are to be carried out.   2. Urgency of  Task. From the  outset, we recognized  theneed to complete our work with all possible speed.   The pressure of imported  supplies upon  the bacon market showed  no sign ofrelaxing, and, although the Agricultural Returns made this summershowed an actual increase in the pig population of England and Wales,there were indications that even those producers in Great Britainwho had pursued a steady production policy, in good times andbad, for a number of years were beginning to lose  heart.   It was, therefore, fortunate that the  investigations conducted by the Pig Industry Council, by the Scottish Pig Industry Committee,by  the Imperial Economic  Committee,  and by the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries,* had placed on  record a mass of evidencepertaining  to the production and  marketing of pigs and bacon.After having studied further documentary evidence and after longand  numerous discussions  with individual  authorities  and  withrepresentatives of many interests,  we have found  the  evidenceof those earlier investigations  substantially confirmed.  Furtherconfirmation has been afforded  by  a valuable report furnished byone of our members who visited Denmark.  From these sources wehave borrowed freely in formulating what we hope will  be a workableplan.   There  is, therefore, no  need to  set  out at  great length thesituation of the industry today ; a  brief  recapitulation, if accom-panied  by references to the reports of the  Pig Industry Counciland the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and if preceded bya short statistical  appreciation, will  suffice.   3. Great Britain as a Producer  of Pig-meat. (a)  Total  Pig-meat Output. Table I shows the pig population, number of pigsslaughtered and  output of pig-meat in Great Britain  from  1911to 1931.   The average annual value of pigs sold off farms in  Great britain during the five years ended June,  1931,  was approximately   22Amillion.  The pig industry thus contributes almost  one-tenth tothe total value of agricultural produce sold off farms in this country.   Although one of the principal  pig-meat consuming countries.Great Britain ranks only moderately high in pig population amongthe nations of the world.  The pig population of Great britain during  the, 5  years.  1926-30f averaged some 2,670,000  head.In 1931, the figure was 2,945,000 head.   The industry is mainly concentrated in England and Wales, the   * For list of reports containing the results of these investigations, seeAppe dix D.   t June 4th census in each year.

Similar figures for a number of other producing countries are :                                              Approximate                                 Pig          Human                              Population^    Population.

In  1931,  3,765,000 pigs  were  slaughtered, giving an approximate output of 5,64S,000  cwt. of pig-meat.  In the 5 years  1909-13, the  average  pig population  was  estimated at about  2,500,000 head,  the average number  of pigs  slaughtered at 3,558,000, and the  average  output  of pig-meat  at  5,336,000 cwt.   Thus,  in spite of considerable  annual variations,  a growing human popula- tion and  an  increase in  the  volume of total  pig-meat  supplies, the home  pig industry, so far as volume of output is concerned, has been virtually stationary during the past 20  years. Meanwhile, the pig population of Denmark increased by almost  150 per cent, in 20  years  (1909-29),  that of  Sweden by about 40  per cent,  in 15 years (1913-28), and that of Holland by about 50 per cent, in 17 years (1913-30), the additional output having come largely  to this  country.   (6) Bacon and Ham Outfit. Annual figures showing  the pro- duction of bacon and hams  as  distinct from other pig-meat (pork, lard and offals) are not available. The industrial censuses of pro- duction carried out by the Board of Trade  in respect of  1924 and 1930  give the following as being  the production of bacon and hams by firms in Great Britain employing more than 10 persons in those two  years:-                    Quantity.         Value.       1924    ......     ... 1,204,000 cwt.     7,560,000       1930    ...     ...     ... 1,238,000 cwt.     6,930,000 In addition, in 1924, firms employing 10 persons or fewer are shown as having  produced 114,000 cwt.  of  bacon and hams.  Unless con-siderable changes have taken  place^n the output and number  ofthese smaller  firms,  the production in  1930&apos;may be estimated,on a conservative basis, at about  1,350,000 cwt.,  valued at  7imillion. This  figure,&apos;  however,  refers only to what may be&apos; called the factory output.  A certain amount of pig-meat is cured  through-out the country by butchers, generally to meet the needs of theirown retail trade, and it is probable that the returns received by the  * Average of figures available for the 5-year period 1926-30. 51S8                                                      A.4
Board of Trade and used to compile the above  totals only com-prised a small proportion from  these &quot; butcher-carers.&quot;   It does,  however, appear that in 1930 something more thanone-quarter  in volume  of the  pig-meat output of Great Britainconsisted of bacon and hams, and the remainder of pork, lard andoffals.   4. Northern Ireland as  a  Producer of  Pig-meat. Table  IIshows the pig population and output of Northern Ireland from1926  to 1931.  The pig population during the  5  years  1926-30averaged about 206,000 head, or some 7 per cent, of the total pigpopulation of the United Kingdom.  The average  number of home-bred pigs produced for slaughter or export in that period was approxi-mately 218,000 per annum.  A considerable number of store pigsimported from the Irish Free State are also fed in Northern Ireland ;these, during the period in question, averaged 64,000 per annum.The  total annual number of pigs produced for slaughter or exportwas  thus, on the average, 282,000,  giving an estimated output ofapproximately  496,000  cwt.  of pig-meat, including edible offal.In 1931, the output of home-bred pigs was estimated at  247,500,imports of stores from the Irish Free State at 77,000, and the out-put of pig-meat at about 567,000 cwt.   In addition to the output of pig-meat from pigs fed in NorthernIreland, a large number of pig carcases  are imported from the IrishFree  State for curing.   The quantities  so imported during recentyears are as follows : The average gross output of the pig and bacon industries in NorthernIreland in the period 1926-30 thus amounted to 694,000 cwt. of pig-meat.  Of this, an average of 410,000 cwt. per annum is estimated to  have  been bacon and hams.  It thus  appears that almost a quarter of  the United  Kingdom  bacon  output is  produced inNorthern  Ireland.    There  is a considerable movement  of bacon and hams  from northern Ireland to Great Britain. The trade in 1926-31 averagedsome 287,000 cwt. per annum.  Between 40,000  and 50,000 cwt.of fresh pork and in the neighbourhood of 20,000 live pigs are alsosent from Northern Ireland  to  Great Britain annually.    5. The  United  Kingdom  as  a  Consumer  of  Pig-meat.-(a) Volume and Character of Supplies. Table III shows the  esti-mated supplies of pig-meat of all kinds (including lard) availablefor consumption in the United Kingdom from 1926 to  1931. Theannual average  quantity during  the  5-year  period  1926-3019261927192819291930 Civt.179,000196,000233,000194,000186,000Average  1926-30 ...198,000 ewt.
 amounted to some  18,960,000 cwt. (valued at about  83 million), or 40-6lb. per head of the population.  In 1931, supplies rose to 21,971,000 cwt., largely as a result of increased imports.    Estimates of the distribution of pig-meat supplies between bacon and hams and other products (pork, lard and offals) can only be given for years covered by the Board of Trade  censuses of production.    It is estimated that, in 1930, out of total supplies amounting to practically 19&amp; million cwt., 11A million  cwt. consisted of bacon and hams and 8 million cwt. of other pig-meat.*    The proportion of home-produced pig-meat to the total supply has been gradually  falling  since 1921.   Of the  average  annual supply in the period  1920-30, 6 million cwt. ( 24  million) was home-produced and nearly 13 million cwt. ( 59 million) imported. Thus, the proportion of home supplies during this period averaged only about 32 per cent, by weight, and in 1931 home output was well below 30 per cent.    Imports of bacon and hams predominate to an increasing extent. In 1930, only 1-f million cwt., or 15 per cent, of the total supplies, was home-produced-)- compared with nearly 10 million cwt. imported. This tendency was probably accelerated by the veterinary embargo imposed in 1926 on the importation of fresh meat from the Con- continent, which caused some foreign producers to turn from pork  to bacon production.   Of other pig-meat, about half the supplies are home-produced.    (b) Note on Imports. This country is easily the most important buyer of pig products in international markets. Of a total annual world  export trade  in  pig-meat (including live  pigs),  averaging some 24 million cwt. in the period 192S-30,:   the  United Kingdom absorbed about  131-  million  cwt. i.e. almost 60 per cent.  Thereis virtually no export market for bacon outside the United Kingdom and over one-third  of the world&apos;s lard exports are sent here. Table IVshows  the net imports of pig products into the United kingdom from  1925 to 1931.   During the 5 years  1926-30, imports (net) of pig products intothe United Kingdom  included, On the  average,  approximately 8,100,000 cwt. of bacon (valued at  39-1 million), 990,000 cwt.  ofhams  (valued at   5,250,000),  2,400,000 cwt.  of  lard  (valued  at 7,600,000),  960,000  cwt.  of pork-fresh, frozen, tinned, etc.  (valued at  4,300,000), and 330,000 live pigs (valued at  2,100,000).  Some  70 per cent,  by volumeg and  76 per cent,  by value  of   * This figure of 8 million cwt. of other pig-meat includes lard, of whiol&apos;2i million cwt. is imported and probably not less than A million cwt. is pro-duced in tho United  Kingdom.   t Including as home-produced that cured in this country from importedpigs and pork.

our imports of pig products on the average are thus bacon and hams.Since 1929 net imports of bacon have very materially increased,and in 1931 amounted to the record figure of 10,743,000 cwt. i.e.2,643,000 owt., or 32 per cent., above the previous 5 years&apos; average.In the first S months of 1932 imports were slightly greater (about  per cent.) in quantity, than during the same period in 1931.  Importsof other pig  products in  1931 were not greatly different from the1926-30 figures,  with the exception of imports of live pigs fromthe Irish Free State, which were 43 per  cent, above the  previous5 years&apos; average.    Table V shows that considerable changes have occurred in recentyears in the  sources of bacon and ham supplies imported  into thiscountry.  The United States, which a few years ago was supplyingalmost one-third, has reduced its exports to a very low figure, while those from Denmark and certain Baltic countries e.g. Poland and lithuania have risen  materially.  Imports from  the  Irish FreeState have to some extent changed over from bacon to pork and live pigs  since the  1926 embargo on fresh-meat imports  from theContinent.  The  main sources of bacon and ham imports into theUnited Kingdom in 1931, with the quantity and percentage obtainedfrom  each source,  are  shown below.  The  percentage from eachsource during the first 8 months of 1932 is also given :                                            Percentage of                              Quantity     Total Imports.                      1031&quot;      1931    &quot; 1932                     000 cwt.

A considerable proportion of these suppliesconsist of pig carcases bought by Northern Irish bacon curers fromdistricts  near the boundary,   Some 270,000 cwt. of frozen pork (see Table VI) was imported.on the average, in the 5 years 1926-30, mainly from New Zealand,the  United States and  Argentina.  A considerable proportion ofthe  imports of frozen pork is bought by curers in this country forconversion into bacon.
           PART II. PROBLEMS  OF THE  INDUSTRY.    0. Weaknesses of the Industry. A summary of tho weaknessesof the industry in  England  and Wales, which are  mainly mattersof organization, is  contained in the second interim report of the pig Industry Council.*  Briefly, these are :        (i) superfluity of  breeds and types ;      (ii) lack of efficiency measures, such as  would  be  provided           by pig-recording and  litter-testing ;      (iii) inadequate technique in feeding and management;      (iv) excessive  losses  from disease ;      (v) irregularity  of production ;      (vi) lack of defined carcase  grades ;     (vii) circuitous route  of fat pigs from farm to  destination ;    (viii) uneven distribution of bacon factories ;      (ix) type of factory cure ;      (x) uneconomic factory throughput ;      (xi) lack of national grade standards for bacon ;     (xii) misrepresentation of imported supplies.   To these, three can  be added from  the Ministry&apos;s Report onthe Marketing of Pigsrf  namely     (xiii) the gamble of  the store market:    (xiv) the absence of payment for quality ;     (xv) inadequate market intelligence.   At first sight, this list of self-criticisms  suggests  an inefficientindustry.  Such  an  assumption would, however,  hardly be fair;the Pig  Industry Council have pointed out courageously whereinlies the possibility of and necessity for obtaining a higher standardof efficiency, which in many cases is difficult of accomplishment bythe individual  but is well  within the capacity of an organizedindustry ;  for it is  mainly the  absence of organization which has caused and perpetuated  this situation.  Later in this Report, it willbe explained how the Commission^ proposals are designed to assist in remedying  most of these weaknesses, which, in general,  arecommon  to the pig  industry  throughout  the United Kingdom.There  are,  however,  three  further  issues of primary importance which required serious study by the Commission before the industry could be advised to embark upon an expansionist bacon  policy.These are discussed in paragraphs 7 9.   7.  The Low Level of  Pig  Prices. The main problem facing thopig industry in  this  country at  the present time is  one  which itshares with agriculture  in  general-the  prevailing  low  levelof prices. The average price per score of first-quality bacon and porkpigs, respectively, in July, 1932, was 9s. 9fZ.  and  10s. Id.  Theseprices compare with averages of 10s.  lid. and 18s.

4-year period  192G-9.   This represents  a fall of 42  per cent, inthe case of bacon pigs and 46 per cent, in the case of pork pigs.   It is true that the cost of feeding-stuffs has also fallen during thesame period.   For example, the prices per ton of barley-meal, maize-meal and imported middlings in  1926-9 and in July, 1932,  were asfollows : 	Barley-meal. Maize-meal.		Middlings.Average 1920-9 ...... July, 1932.........	  s. d. 10 12 6 7 4 0	  s. d. 9 17 (i 5 15 0	  s. d. 9 19 0 19 0Fall............	3 8 6 (32%)	4 2 6 (41%)	2 2 9 (24%)   Thus, though feed prices have fallen, they have not done so j)ro-disproportionately to pig prices, while overhead charges (including labour)have not  appreciably  decreased.   The present low prices of pigs do not merely reflect the all-roundfall in agricultural commodity prices that has occurred since themiddle of 1929 ; they may be correlated with the immense increase in imports of bacon during 1931 and the current year, referred to above.There is  this  further  depressing factor in the  case  of pigs,  inthat, not only  in this country but also on the Continent, the first half of 1932 appears to mark the apex  of one of the regularlyrecurring  pig-supply  cycles described  below.  Thus,&apos; whereas thegeneral level of agricultural prices in Great Britain has fallen from44 per cent,  above pre-War in 1929 to 6 per cent, above pre-Warin July, 1932, in the same period the price of bacon pigs has fallenfrom 60 per cent, above to 13 per cent, below pre-War, and that of pork pigs from 65 per cent, above to 14 per cent, beloiv pre-War.   Prima facie,  therefore, the pig  industry  can substantiate  a stronger claim than most branches of agriculture for  some measureaimed at reducing supplies or raising prices to a more normal leveland  generally of creating more stable conditions.   His Majesty&apos;s Government has already declared its recognition ofthe bacon industry&apos;s need, in certain circumstances, for assistance bythe  regulation of imports. We are, therefore, content to affirmthat  our  enquiries have left  us in no doubt that  the  organizeddevelopment of the home bacon industry cannot be initiated in the face  of  unregulated competition  from  established  Continentalindustries.   8. The  Pig  and Feed Cycles. Three distinct types  of variationare noticeable  in the course of pig prices,  both in this country andabroad.  There is, firstly, the long-period trend of prices, rising inthe years before the War and falling in the post-War period ; this is governed chiefly  by changes  in  the value of money.  Secondly,there are fluctuations within each season due to customary methodsof production, such  as the association of cheese-making and pig-feeding in the  summer, and to seasonal demand.  Finally, there is
74* Marketing Leaflets Nos. 15, 10, 23 and 30.f Economic Series No. 12. the pig cycle, lasting normally about four years, which consists of a period of rising prices followed by an approximately equal period of falling prices.  The last form of price variation is much the most important under normal conditions, and we would stress the fact that it has shown  a definite tendency in the United Kingdom  to become both shorter in period and more severe in incidence.   During the period  from 1923  to the general  collapse of prices in  1931, the prices of bacon pigs in England and Wales varied from about 22 per cent, above the trend to about 41 per cent, below.   The serious effects of these violent cyclical price-movements upon the industry  are well  known ; they are  discussed  at length in the Reports of the Pig Industry Council,* and in the Ministry&apos;s Report on the Marketing of Pigs.&apos;\ Their significance, when compared with those of other meats, may be judged from the fact that during the 7 years ending May, 1932, total pig-meat supplies showed a range of variation of  30  per cent., whereas supplies  of all meats taken together, including pig-meat, only showed a range of Si per cent., and supplies of other meats i.e. beef and veal, mutton and lamb - of less than 2i- per cent.   The following  paragraphs are  based upon unpublished  work done  at the Department of  Agricultural  Economics,  University College of Wales.   It is generally agreed that in any country the pig-price  cycle is not appreciably  influenced by the demand for pig-meat, but is almost entirely due to changes in the supplies of pigs and pig-meat; moreover, in this  country, as in others,  changes in  the home pig population appear to have been the chief cause of the  cycle in pig prices, and imports of pigs and pig-meat appear to have had only a subsidiary influence on the cycle.   The chief factor influencing  the volume of  supplies of pigs  at any one time is the anticipation of profit or loss from  pig-raising by the mass of fanners.  Although the decision to increase or decrease production does not affect the market supplies until  many months later,  owing  to  the   time required  for breeding  and  feeding, most  farmers appear to assume that the existing relation of pig prices and feeding  costs will continue.    Thus,  farmers take steps to increase  or  decrease production when  feed  is cheap  or  dear relatively to pig prices.  But the full  results of such decisions arenot felt until many months later, when there comes a change in the relation between feed costs and pig prices that has not been expected by the  mass of farmers.  The latter  then begin to  reverse  their previous production policy, and so the pig  cycle is perpetuated.   The influence of fluctuations in the pig-price  cycle upon theprofits of pig-keeping  is enhanced  by the influence  of a cycle of feeding-stuffs prices, which tends to  move inversely to the pig-price

Both bacon-pig prices and feeding-stuffs prices have been expressed in terms of the samo constant standard (100).

In this case,tho peak of the cyclo was slightly later than usual.   The pig-price cycle, which in all countries has been the curse ofthe pig industry, is, therefore, closely inter-related with the feeding-stuffs price cycle, but the exact nature of the inter-relation betweenthe two cycles is uncertain.  Since feeding-stuffs prices in the UnitedKingdom under present conditions are determined by world prices,the cyclical changes in their general level are due chiefly to influencesoutside this country.  At least in the United Kingdom, therefore,it is likely that the influence of the price of feeding-stuffs on farmers&apos;production policy and hence on the price of pigs has been muchgreater than the effect of pig supplies on the price of feeding-stuffs.   If,  therefore, the pig industry in the United Kingdom is to be successfully developed, the  influence  of both pig and feed-pricecycles  upon farmers&apos; policy must be removed or, at least,  reduced ;the real problem is how to persuade farmers to adopt a consistentproduction programme, properly adapted to the capacity of baconfactories and to consumers&apos; demand.   The first essential seems to us, therefore,. to be that the supplyof bacon  marketed in the United Kingdom should be stabilized.This would encourage the planned and steady production of baconpigs, both at home and  ultimately in bacon exporting countries,and  might lead to a general diminution of the  cycle  of supplies and  prices of pig-meat.   At  least in the near future,  however, it is likely that the pigcycle in the United Kingdom will continue in the pork-pig market,   *  In the period 1923-32 feed prices varied by 16 per cent, above and42 per cent, below the trend.cycle, so that when pig prices are high, feed costs tend to be low and vice versa ; moreover, its fluctuations are as wide as those ofthe pig-price cycle* (see Diagram A).  In consequence, the ratio of pig prices to feed prices varies considerably, which results in widefluctuations in the subsequent production and prices of pigs.  It hasbeen demonstrated that a high or low ratio of pig prices to feed prices in the United Kingdom tends to be followed about 21 months laterby correspondingly low or high pig prices.  This is illustrated by theexamples in the following Table : 
for which we have not in this report proposed any system of regula- \tion.   To protect the bacon industry from the effects of this cycle,it is necessary that the bacon-pig and pork-pig markets should besegregated, in order to reduce the diversion  to the pork market,when pork prices are high, of pigs required by the bacon industry.We recommend measures to secure this segregation.   If these areeffective and we fully realize the difficulty of the task it remains to protect the bacon-pig  industry from the effect of variations infeed prices.   If  bacon-pig  prices were completely stabilized, net returns to farmers  would still vary inversely  with feeding-stuffs  costs,  and itwould be  impossible to prevent fluctuations in  the supply of pigsto bacon factories, even though the influence of the  pork marketwere completely removed.  We therefore  recommend, in a  subse-quent paragraph, a method of basing tho prices of bacon pigs on feedprices.  It must be emphasized, however, that this policy wouldpartly be dependent for its success on the segregation of the porkand bacon markets, and partly on the ability of other sections ofthe industry  (e.g. the curers) to bear the risks of fluctuations in theprices of feeding-stuffs, in so far as these cannot be passed on to the consumer in  higher bacon  prices.    In practice, complete segregation of the pork and bacon markets and complete absorption of feed-cost  fluctuations by curers  may prove difficult, but the advantages in  escaping from the disturbing effects of  the pig and  feed-price cycle are  so  great that we believe that these two obstacles must be faced in order to secure the utmost practicable stabilization of  supplies.    9. Co-Existence of Pork and Bacon Markets. One of the main factors  responsible  for the problems of the pig industry in this country is the existence  of two alternative outlets for fat pigs  the pork  and the  bacon markets.    In Great Britain, those feeders   who specialize   in  producing for either the pork or the bacon market are easily in  the minority, though  since the embargo on the importation of fresh pork from the Continent was imposed in  1926  relatively greater attention seems to have  been paid to pork production.  Some farmers vacillate between one type of production and  the  other, according to their judgment of the prospects  of profit, while others just produce pigs and aim  at neither market in particular.    The  existence  of  alternative  outlets  for pigs has undoubted advantages,  but it  has also serious disadvantages.   The fact that British curers have to compete for their raw material with the pork market is one of the main reasons why bacon factories in this country  are \mable to maintain  a full and  regular  throughput.  On this  point,  the  Pig Industry Council observes  &quot; that the  regularity  of  output  in Scandinavia as  compared with  this country is  largely due  to  the fact  that production  there is directed almost  exclusively towards the  bacon market and  that the existence  of
alternative  markets  here though  it  has  some  compensatingadvantages severely militates against the regularity. that is,  on general grounds, desirable.&quot;   Apart from a high average throughput, curers require  a regularsupply of  pigs all the year round.  Unfortunately, the competition of the pork market is greater in winter than in summer,  and thishas made  more difficult the maintenance of level supplies to baconfactories throughout the year.  Many farmers and  dealers favour the pork  market  during the winter  season, particularly aroundChristmas time, and only look to the factory as an outlet  when thepork market fails  them.   Attention is drawn later to the wide variations in bacon factorykillings from week to week and to  their effects on bacon factoryeconomy.   The competition of the pork  market  is  undoubtedlyone of the major  causes of these  variations, though not  the onlycause.  The price the  curer  can afford to pay depends on the prevailing level of bacon prices, which, again, is largely determinedby imports.  When the curers&apos; prices are low relatively to the priceof pork, the factories naturally tend to go short of pigs.   As it is the bacon industry  that mainly suffers from  the existenceof a dtial  market for pigs, the remedy appears to us to lie in ear-marking  for the  bacon  industry annually a certain volume of  pig production, by means of an organized system of contracts betweenfeeders and curers, with provision for regular deliveries throughoutthe year.   Tliis is one of the main  features of  our proposals and,from the point of view of the producer, it is the most serious feature.To-day, the home bacon industry exists largely upon surplus suppliesleft over  from the pork market; no  manufacturing  industry canthrive  under  such  conditions.  Moreover,  as  the Pig   IndustryCouncil has pointed out, the possibilities of an expansion of the porkmarket are small  but of the  bacon market are  very  considerable.If, with State assistance, a determined effort is to be made to buildtip a large and increasing bacon industry, then producers  must face the necessitj&apos; of a reversal of the roles now played by the bacon andpork markets and must regard the latter as a surplus outlet for  thepossibly fluctuating supplies not required by the former.PART m.-PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMISSIONS  PROPOSALS.   10. Some Issues of Principle. Stripped of detail, the task beforethe Conrmission resolved itself into a few clear-cut issues.  the regulation  of  the  sales of home-produced pigs  and pig productswould be of limited utility if it did not aim at the expansion of thosesales, but whereas the pork market offers little prospect of a  per-manent profitable  expansion,  home production only contributedhi 1931 about one-eighth of the total home supplies of  bacon and
hams.  An expansionist pig jx)policy must,  therefore, be directed to securing an increasing share of the bacon and ham trade.   To  make  room for this expansion,  it is necessary to regulateimports,  but  in  so  doing it  is most necessary to  safeguard theconsumer and other public interests.   It is  also  necessary to protect the bacon industry from thefluctuating competition&apos; of the pork market, and, as we have stated,it appeared to us that the two outlets should be segregated.   A further drawback affecting the  bacon industry, which in thepast may  have exercised a  more powerful influence  even thanContinental competition, is the &quot; pig  and  feed &quot; cycle to which wohave referred.  Disturbing as  cyclical  influences may be  on any commodity, they are doubly so on a manufacturing industry wliichaims at regularity of output and of which regularity of output willbe required as an administrative expedient to facilitate the regula-tion of competing imports.  Any bacon policy must therefore seek to eliminate  the  influence of  the &quot; pig and feed &quot;  cycle upon theproduction of bacon pigs. It  would  be  desirable  to discouragethese maleficent influences also in the  case of bacon imports and home pork production, but in the latter case elimination wouldprobably be impossible without a stringency of regulation, cxtend-ing over every phase of pig production,  which we are anxious toavoid.   We have  had regard to the fact that the fresh-pork market  isalready sheltered and that there is under discussion a scheme for regulating  the marketing  of livestock and dead meat, and we con-sider that the moment  is opportune to isolate the organizationof the  bacon industry from that of the fresh-meat industry.  Wetherefore recommend that the  early  endeavours of pig producersshould be concentrated upon  the regulation and expansion of the bacon  industry and  that, at the start,  the pork market should beleft  unregulated.  We are aware that this course  of action will present its own particular difficulties, to which we refer in paragraph32, when discussing the contract system, but, on balance, we believethat Ave have chosen  the alternative which presents the  greatestprospects of success.    11. The Principle of a  Constructive  Bacon Quota;  its Power  toShelter the Home Industry. In our  terms of reference, we were instructed to consider how far the application of the quota system to bacon and hams would facilitate our proposals, and we had nomandate to consider whether  the organized expansion of the home industry could not better be assisted by some form of Customs duty;yet  it was impossible for this latter alternative  entirely  to  be ignored.    It is not always  appreciated that bacon is  seldom eaten on theContinent  and that the bacon-curing  industries of Scandinavia, theNetherlands  and the Baltic States have been built up to meet therequirements  of  Great Britain and  have no  other outlet of any
consequence.  This  feature differentiates  bacon  production from most  other agricultural industries  and   is  of  such  importance as  to  render  of doubtful application  to  the   bacon  industrygeneral arguments on the  merits of different protective  systemsbased  on  the  experience  of  other   commodities.   Moreover,the   imposition  of  a Customs  duty  upon  imports would   do nothing to  check the recurrent  surpluses  and  scarcity  of pigs,resulting  from  their  natural prolificacy and from the phenomenaof  price   cycles.    On  the   contrary,   these  very  conditions would  compel  exporting countries to  continue  shipping  to thiscountry during the  surplus period in the hope of recovering their losses on  the arrival of the inevitable scarcity.  Having had regardto these  incidents in pig  production, we appreciate the  wisdom of the instruction given to us, for while the effect of a fixed or sliding-scale import duty on bacon might be to afford the pig producer a cash  benefit, it could do nothing to  assist the ordered expansionof the home bacon industry.   Among the factors which had satisfied us that a quota systemregulating  the volume of all supplies is well adapted to the needsof the bacon industry are the following :        (a) It enables effectivo and carefully regulated protection to be given    to home and other producers and&quot; removes from all countries the power    and, therefore, the inclination  to evade that protection.        (6) At the same time, it is a flexible system and can so be framed as    to leave all producers  (home, overseas-Empire and foreign)  able, by    competition amongst&apos;  themselves in  all  matters  appertaining to    efficiency, to reap duo  rewards in price and in quota.        (c) Tho consumer can  be  assured a regular and adequate supply,    whilst demand is left elastic in that the consumer is not unduly limited    in his choice of the bacon he wishes to buy.  Hence, the quota system,    with tho safeguards which we recommend, should, over a period, exercise    a moderating  influence on price changes ; the  extreme fluctuation of    bacon prices, specially noticeable in the past in this trade over 4-yearly    periods, should at least bo reduced very considerably.  A rise in bacon    prices is, however, inevitable, and is, in fact, already taking place.        (d) The fact that this country is the only European market for bacon    focusses a violent hut unstable foreign competition  on to  the home    producer.  The position is aggravated by  the further fact that home    production is so small compared with foreign production. At the same    time, these facts combine to facilitate the regulation of the market from    the United Kingdom end.        (e) The curer is dependent for his raw material on a supply of suitable     pigs.  If this supply is  to be regular, the farmer must provide it by plan-     ning ahead, for which he will require some  certainty as to price.  If     the curor, then, is to be bound to take pigs from farmers at a guaranteed     basic price over an extended period, he should, in turn, be secured  a     reasonable chance of selling the finished product without loss on a regu-     lated market.        (/) The possibility of  a rapidly alternating expansion and  reduction     of pig  production is so great, and the influence upon the industry of     this haphazard prodtiction is so serious, that no protective measure can     be of permanent good unless it is able to check not only excessive impor-
    tation of bacon but also over-production of bacon pigs at home.  It is.    therefore, an essential feature of the quota system which we recommend    that, at tho same time, it both permits and regulates the rate of expansion    of the home bacon industry.    12. The Principle of a Constructive Bacon Quota : its  Effect on imports. But  apart from the efficacy of the quota as a piece ofprotective machinery, we have also  considered the wider questionof whether it is likely ultimately to help or hinder trade.    The quota is an untried instrument in this country.  By othercountries it has been regarded as a temporary expedient, to be usedin a period of crisis without regard to its general merits or demerits,and as an economic weapon, the use of which is to be restricted, sofar as international  law permits,  to imports  only ;   the limitedContinental experience which we have studied well illustrates thisdoctrine. We believe that the quota method deserves more thorough investigation from a new angle, freed from the common conception of it as a purely restrictive or retaliatory measure.  In no  country has it yet been regarded as a constructive instrument which, undersuitable conditions, can play a useful  part in the economic develop-ment of both exporting  and importing countries ; this is the  con-ceirtion of the^quota&quot;lvTjn!rdvoT^e-itrr^1iTi&apos; bacon industry.    There is no doubt that bacon prices during the past  year havenecessitated the  payment to Continental pig producers  of prices which failed to cover their costs, and there is evidence that  more thanone country is  temporarily slackening  in its efforts  to maintainor improve its position in the contest for our market.   But there is reason to think that,  under unregulated conditions of import, thecontest would be maintained with sufficient vigour to enable thesurviving participants ultimately to  recoup themselves for their losses.  In  consequence, the  consumer might  well  find  himselfdeprived, even at an enhanced price, of more than one  supply ofbacon to which he had become attached by reason of quality or price,and in  the  meantime the home bacon industry would continue indifficulty.   The only attraction in the bacon market  to-day is theprospect of higher prices  due to short supplies ; this is  withoutdoubt an incentive to efficiency and to endurance, but the approach to  this  goal is as unsatisfactory to the Continental and home pro-producer as its attainment must be to the home consumer.    The alternative,  as visualized by the Commission, is a condition which will offer a protected market in the United Kingdom  to every country,  subject  only to  a gradual  diminution  of imports from foreign  countries  in favour  of  home  producers.  The desire of a  country  to  retain  its share  in  this  market  will  thenprovide an incentive to efficiency as powerful as  any to-day,  andthere is reason to hope that such a system will come to be regarded by all exporting countries not as a handicap  on their  legitimatetrade but as a constructive element which will give renewed con-fidence in international relations.
                                                             rj o                                                             JO                             21   Critics in another quarter may see in our quota proposals a danger that the proffered security in this market will  lead to the exploi-tation  of the  consumer by exporters  or by the  home  industry.This possibility has been prominently before us and we have con-sidered  various safeguards, such  as :         (a)  some form of buying authority to purchase imports ;        (6)  some measure by which the increased price (if any) due    to the  quota  might be reclaimed from the foreign shippers ;        (c)  a global quota (as opposed to a national quota for each    foreign country),  or  some  other  means  of  making foreign    countries compete amongst themselves for the quota available ;        [d)  some  form  of corporation which would enter into and    gradually absorb the  home curing  trade.   Such safeguards, however, entail a degree of control which we are unwilling to recommend,  or were found, on examination, not to fulfil anticipations.  We  think that producers in every country will, through self-interest,  refrain  from  abusing  the scheme to then&apos;own eventual prejudice, and so render unnecessary the introductionof safeguards such as the  above.   To give substance to this belief,we recommend that the quota-determining body (described  by theCommission as the &quot; Quota Advisory Committee &quot; see paragraph 20 on the analogy of the Import Duties Advisory Committee), shall beprovided with adequate powers and that it shall be an instruction to this body, when considering quota revision, in total or as between countries,  to  seek  information  on the following, amongst othermatters, and be guided accordingly :         (a)  the trend over an extended period of prices of all supplies    of bacon, compared with those of maize or other feeding-stuffs ;        (b)  costs  at all stages of  production and marketing ;        (c)  quality of  supplies ;        (d)  regularity and volume of supplies as indicated by the     quota  returns ;        (e)  effect of the quota on the interests of the United Kingdom    consumer.    13.  Possibilities  of a Voluntary  Arrangement. Throughoutour  Report  we  have  assumed that,  at  any rate initially, HisMajesty&apos;s Government intends to  be responsible for the distributionof quotas  among the  various countries concerned and for  theadministration of the system as a  whole. In no other way could anearly start  be made with the task of substituting an orderly and evenadaptation of supply to demand for the present violent fluctuationsand alternations of prosperity and ruin that characterize the market for pig-meat both  at home and abroad.  At  the  same time, werecognize that there is much to be said for exploring the possibility
of replacing as soon as practicable a system under which the Stateregulates  imports compulsorily by one under which supplies areregulated voluntarily as part of an agreed and approved plan cover-ng all the main sources home, overseas-Empire and foreign theState confining  itself to the role of policeman (or merely  that ofumpire)  and  guardian of  the  interests of home producers and consumers.  Naturally,  the development  of. an effective inter-national arrangement for  supply-regulation  on  these lines  must depend on the anterior  organization of producers in  the  various industries and national areas, and  it is a virtue of the compulsorysystem that  it will,  in all probability, bring about a sufficientconcentration of control in each supplying country during the periodof its  application to provide the degree of organization requiredfor voluntary action at a later date.    In  any case, an endeavour might well be made to secure the, co-operation of exporting countries in the administration of the initialcompulsory system.  Effective co-operation would greatly simplify the task of supervision ;  it might to some extent avoid the necessityof introducing import licences and certificates (see later) and it wouldpave the way for a voluntary movement.    14. The  Principle  of  the  Contract  System for Pigs. If  ahome  quota were not desirable  on other grounds, we would recom-mend  its imposition as an essential feature of an expansionist baconpolicy. It is, indeed, a corollary that if total supply is to be stabilizedand if regulation is to be applied to imports,  some steps must also betaken  to stabilize the home  supply and to ensure that it shall be forthcoming.    The  industry  needs  protection  from fluctuations  in  output.The producer who regularly breeds or feeds a constant number of pigs each  year needs to be protected against  low prices  caused by&quot; in-and-out&quot; producers.   Moreover, irregular production cannotbe associated with regular  prices, based on production costs, suchas producers  have shown a unanimous desire to obtain.   For solong as the quantitative pig cycle is permitted to influence bacon-pig production, for so long must prices continue to be  low when allfarmers have pigs to sell, and to be high when few farmers can takeadvantage  of the high prices.    From the factory angle, stability of output is of even greater importance.  Its   effect  on manufacturing  costs is considerable, but its effect on sales is vital.  Bacon is a perishable article  which must  be put into immediate  trade circulation ;  it wordd probably not be difficult, in spite of  price considerations, to sell  a  larger volume of home-produced bacon today if curers  had any certainty that they could maintain  supplies,  but no retailer  is prepared to chop  and change his source of supplies and the type of bacon he offers from week to week to suit the convenience of home producers. For this reason,  a rapid expansion of home bacon production,  if
followed in a few months&apos; time by an equally rapid reaction, would bemore costly  and dangerous than the  continuation  of our baconoutput  on a  lower level.  The problem is to encourage expansion but to restrict the rate of expansion to  one that can be maintained ;  only by such control willit be possible to make sure that ground gained will be held.   Wo  do not  think that  many will  quarrel  with this abstractprinciple :  criticism is more likely to focus on the machinery requiredto put it into practice.  In order to control the rate of expansion itis necessary to  prevent both over-production and under-production.The first can  be controlled by placing a quota upon the home output.Under-production,  on the  other hand,  cannot be  prevented sodirectly, for there is not nor would anyone desire that there shouldbe any law compelling a man to produce pigs against bis will.  Theonly solution apparent to the Commission is to restrict the permis-sible volume  of j)roduction to a figure which producers have under-taken to supply, thus, in effect, allowing home producers themselvesto fix the home qtiota according to their capacity to supply it.  Butin order that the home quota should not fluctuate from one period to another, it would also seem necessary to pre-determine a niaxi-mum rate of expansion  which shall operate automatically so longas producers continue to fulfil their undertaking, and to  provide that, subject to this automatic expansion,  the quantity actuallysupplied in any one contract period shall  be the  starting  point for  fixing the home quota  in  the subsequent period.   It remains to discover the method by which a given  volume  of productioncan be guaranteed, and for  this purpose there seems  no alternative to the  contract system.   The foundation of our recommendations wliich are described in subsequent paragraphs is, therefore, that the home quota shall equalthe bacon  equivalent of the total number of pigs which producershave  contracted to supply to bacon factories and that the sale byregistered curers (seepage 103) of bacon made in this country frompigs which are not sold  on contract shall be, in effect, impossible.   This suggestion is drastic, but we recommend that its acceptancebe a condition precedent to the regulation of imports.  Apart fromits desirability in the interest of the bacon industry, the positionof the consumer4  cannot be ignored.  The effect of a quota, in thepresent condition  of over-supply, will be to reduce the quantity ofbacon available for purchase, and, therefore, precaution must betaken to ensure that the whole of that reduced supply is forthcoming.   * We realize that a Committee of&apos;Investigation and a Consumers&apos; Com-mittee will be appointed under the Agricultural Marketing Act to protectconsumers and other interests from injury through the abuse of its power bya marketing board, but becaxise we recommend special restrictions on suppliesnot contemplated by the Act so also wo feel bound to recommend specialsafeguards.
i    15.  Main  Headings  of Proposals. Such  problems   as  thestabilization  of supplies and prices, involving the segregation of thepork and bacon markets, cannot be solved by the industry per sewithout  Government intervention ; to overcome  these difficulties,we propose the quota and  -contract systems.   Por other  matters,such as the improvement of  marketing methods,  the standardizationof good-quality pig types, the increased efficiency of pig production,and the rationalization of the curing industry, we suggest machinery to help pig keepers and bacon curers, collectively  and individually,to improve the efficiency of the industry as a whole.    Our recommendations therefore fall under three main headings namely, (a) quotas, [b) contracts, and (c) general  efficiency measures,and will  be explained in that order in the succeeding paragraphs.    1C.  Structure  and  Machinery of  Proposals. Before  putting forward our major proposals in any detail, however, we desire first toindicate the structural framework of our proposed plan of reorganisation -zation (see Diagram B).    We  have  adopted  the  principle,   firstly,  that bodies whosefunctions are mainly judicial or executive should, as far as  possible,be separate entities, and, secondly, that bodies  of the former classshould be non-representative and those of the  latter  class mainlyrepresentative in membership, for on executive bodies woidd fallthe onus of  operations  requiring practical  knowledge   and thewilling concurrence  of the  industry.  Further, the  achievement of simplicity and  practicability has been  our  constant objective.   Analysing our  recommendations, it is found that  the  relevantfunctions fall under the following main headings :        (a) Quota  determination and allocation.       (6) Home  and  import quota administration.       (c) Negotiation of contract terms and prices.       (d) Contract administration,  including  the assembly  and             transport of pigs.       (e) The formulation and approval of plans for developing             and increasing the general efficiency of the industry.       (/) Execution of approved plans.       (g) &quot; Efficiency  services,&quot; such as  carcase  and  bacon             standardization, pig-recording, etc.    Quota determination should be in the hands of an independent and non-representative body, judicial in character ; for this function,we suggest  (see also paragraph 20)  a Quota Advisory Committee,similar in character  to the  existing Import Duties Advisory Com-mittee.   Quota administration should  also, as  far as possible, bein the hands of an impartial organization.  The import quota will be administered and verified, we anticipate, by the Customs Authorities.

 The homo quota should, we suggest, be administered to the satis- faction of the  Quota Advisory Committee by  the Pig Industry Development Board, to  which we refer later.  This Board  will be mainly representative.    We suggest (paragraph 20) that the Quota Advisory Committee will from time to time require to consult or to be consulted by the home and import interests.   The Pig Industry Development Board is the obvious body for this purpose on the home side :  for the import side, we suggest a Bacon Imports Advisory Committee, con- sisting of representatives of  bacon importers and bacon distributors.    The Quota Advisory Committee, the Pig Industry Development Board and the Bacon Imports Advisory Committee will, of course, have United Kingdom  status.    Under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, there will be needed a Great Britain Pigs Marketing Board and a Great Britain Bacon Marketing Board.  In addition, as the Agricultural Marketing Act does not extend to, and as conditions are  different in. Northern Ireland, there will probably be two comparable bodies in Ulster.    Contract terms and prices must be negotiated by representatives of farmers on the one hand and of curers on the other ;  tliis will be one of the sjxjcial functions of the Pigs Marketing Board, representing pig producers, but  we are informed  that  an amendment of the Agricultural Marketing Act will  be  required before it can become a recognized function of the Bacon Marketing Board, representing the bacon eurers.   Contract administration  will  be  in the hands of the Pigs Marketing Board,  which for this purpose  will require to collaborate  with  the  Bacon  Marketing  Board.   This  essential collaboration  would most  easily  be  maintained through the  Pig Industry Development Board.   Both  Marketing Boards will  be concerned with efficiency services (see paragraphs 34-44).   We attach particular importance to the Pig Industry Develop- ment Board.  This body should be representative of the Marketing Boards, strengthened by the  addition of three independent members, one of whom should be the Chairman.   The probable functions of this body, which  include the administration of  the home  quota. the control of new factory construction and extension (see paragraphs 41, 42 and  43), and the formulation of a common policy,  clearly indicate the need for this Board as a representative body to  link up the separate interests of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of pig producers and bacon curers.  This body,&apos; in our view,  should be empowered to arbitrate  between the two commodity  boards in the event of a breakdown in  their negotiations over contract terms and prices.  We think, it desirable. that this body  should be given legal status and  executive power by new  legislation, preferably in the form of an amendment to the Agricultural Market-ing Act, 1931.   It should be financed on some equitable basis bythe constituent Great  Britain boards and by  the correspondingbodies   in Northern  Ireland.
s          PART IV. QUOTA  RECOMMENDATIONS.   17.  Import Quotas. The  administration  of  quotas can take several  forms,  of  which two in particular have been  examinedclosely by the Commission namely, what may be called  &quot; global &quot;and  &quot; national &quot; quota  systems.   In either case, it is necessary to determine the total permissiblevolume of imports over  a given period.  Under the global system,the whole of  this volume is  thrown open to competition  among allexporting countries ;  under the national  system, a share in thisquota  is allocated  specifically to each exporting country.  It is already contemplated in the Act (Section 15 (2) ) that theduties of a  Reorganization Commission will not necessarily  ceasewith  the preparation of a scheme, and we contemplate that the subsequent operation of any bacon scheme will call for the assistanceof an independent body competent to initiate plans and to examinethose prepared by the industry with a view to forwarding a request to the Minister that they should be given statutory sanction.   Butwe think it right to exceed our instructions to the extent of suggesting that the interests of agriculture would best be served  by a singlepermanent  body  rather than by a number of Commissions ;  thiswould, in effect,  become  an independent  but statutory national planning body, not limited to the consideration of pigs and baconbut acting  as a non-political and permanent body, financed from public funds, to watch over the movement, now clearly discernible,towards  closer association of effort  in agricultural marketing, to devise ways and means of promoting organized efficiency at all stages and to put forward suggestions for solving the structuralproblems that arise in applying the principles of organization tothe many primary and manufacturing industries that make up theagricultural industry as a whole and in adapting agricultural com-merce to the changed conditions of the post-War world.   The execution of approved plans must be in the hands of  thosewho know the industry i.e. the Pig Industry  Development Boardwhen issues are involved which are common to  the whole industry,or, perhaps, are shared with other industries, or the Pigs or BaconMarketing Boards, when their individual interests alone are at stake.   Efficiency services,  such as pig and bacon standardization, pig-recording and litter-testing,  production and  marketing research,could be carried out by the Pigs or Bacon Marketing Boards underthe provisions of our  draft  schemes (see Appendices  A and B).Most  of these services  will, however, be so essentially of utility to both feeders and  curers, that they might, with considerable mutual advantage, be performed by what will be,  in fact, a joint board ofthese interests and the executive headquarters  of the industry- i.e.  the&apos; Pig Industry Development  Board.
   It has been claimed on behalf of the global quota system that, by encouraging competition, it will secure the cheapest possible suppliesof bacon and that it will favour the most efficient shippers, but we see the following objections to it.  There would be a tendency for imports to be rushed to our  ports  by competing shippers at thebeginning of every quota  period,  an action which  must causeconfusion in administration, in supply and, consequently, in price,whether the quota period be long or short.  The system would alsointroduce uncertainty into the distributive  trade, which  would never be sure of continuity of supplies of a given type.   Finally, it woidd offer little attraction  in our markets to those,countries which have built  up, or wish to build up and maintain,a bacon industry, and might well discourage production for export to this country to an extent that would injure the home consumer.   The chief objection offered to the national system is that it may give shippers an opportunity to exploit this market ; our views on thispoint have been given in paragraph 12. and we can only point tothe precautions which  we  have recommended  in the concludingsentence of  that paragraph and  reiterate  our belief  that security in this market will  be regarded as too valuable an asset to be thusabused.  Moreover, the  known interchangeability of public demand from  one food-stuff to another, and, particularly, from one kindof meat  to  another, is  an  additional safeguard.   We therefore recommend that a quota should be allotted to eachexporting country and  that the quota period should  be one of 12months, the national allocations being reconsidered annually. Withinthe quota year, each  exporting  country  should  be required to deliver equal proportions of its quota within  each fortnightly sub-quota period, subject to adjustments proved to be necessary to meetseasonal fluctuations in market demand.   Equalization of deliveryundoubtedly presents a  more difficult problem  to,  say,  UnitedStates shippers,who are further from this market, but nothing shouldbe permitted to destroy the stability of market supply, which is the foundation of our proposals.  It is possible that this difficulty maybe minimized if delivery is permitted from bonded warehouses in thiscountry and if a system of tolerance is adopted which will allow each country  a maximum variation of 5 per  cent, above  or below thestandard  quantity, both  over  the whole year and  within  eachfortnightly  sub-quota period.    Provision should,  however, he made for the re-adjustment andre-allocation of any country&apos;s quota, not only at the end of a yearbut in the course of a year if imports from that country are outsidethe tolerance limits and, in particular, if they fall below the lowerlimit of  the fortnightly tolerance for three consecutive  fortnightlyperiods or for six or more fortnightly periods in any six months.The Quota Advisory  Committee should  also have  an overridingpower to recommend, in the public interest,  arbitrary increases ordecreases in the quota of any country.
9 i   Similar administrative provisions should govern all  imports,whether from Empire or foreign countries, and we consider that anypreferential quota allocation given to a country within the BritishEmpire should be at the expense of the foreign import quota and not of the home  quota.   Except in the circumstances covered  by the immediately succeeding sentence, the control over  the quantitiesof bacon imported woidd be most easily maintained at the ports.  Aspecial  situation is  presented  by countries such as New Zealand,Australia  and the Irish Free State, exports from which may takethe form of fresh or frozen carcases (and also live pigs in the case ofthe Irish  Free State) to be used for manufacture into bacon in theUnited Kingdom ; in these cases, such imports should be admittedonly as part of  the  bacon quota  of the exporting country.   Theprocedure explained in paragraphs  IS and  20 will  suffice  to ad-minister such an arrangement.   IS. The Home Quota. We have  already  recommended  thatthe home  quota shall be allotted in accordance with the number of pigs  contracted  to be sold to  bacon factories* during any quotaperiod, and we suggest that the home-quota period shall also be oneyear, and that there shall be a tolerance  of 5 per cent, above and below the quota figure.   In  &quot;lore  specific detail, we recommend that the home baconquota shall be equal to, and shall not exceed, the total number of contracts  for pigs for delivery within the quota period  and that itshall be permitted to increase automatically by 10 per cent,  j everyfour months, provided that the volume of contracts shows  a corre-sponding increase and provided also that it shall in no  case exceed the actual quantity of bacon sold during the preceding  period,plus the four-monthly 10 per cent, increases.   To implement this proposal, there will need to be a standard rateof conversion from pigs to bacon for the purposes of quota calcu-lation ; this will need to vary as between the Wiltshire and Midlandtrades.   The effect of these proposals will be        (a) that the home quota will not exceed a figure  at which    producers have contracted to supply and curers to accept the    raw material ;       (6) that to the extent  that the conversion scale, referred to    above, operates correctly, curers will be prevented from selling,    in  the United Kingdom, bacon made from non-contract pigs,    or from contract pigs in excess of quota requirements, and there-   *Tluoughout this Report we have interpreted &quot; bacon factories &quot; in thelight of the definition of  &quot; curer &quot; in paragraph 2  of the Pigs MarketingScheme (Appendix A) :  We  consider that, for quota purposes, no noticeshould be taken of the casual output of small butcher-curers.   fAs the volume  of imports is today at least eight times the volume ofthe home output, for some years to come the four-monthly increases in thehome  quota will represent such comparatively small quantities that importquota,s might  be  adjusted only once a year.
    fore  there will be no  demand for non-contract bacon pigs, or  J    for contract pigs in excess  of  quota requirements except (i)    to replace contract casualties, or (ii) for manufacture into bacon    for export ;       (c) that, in consequence, the export of bacon will need to be    done under licence,  which would be issued on request;       (d) that  curers will only  be able  to  sell bacon made from    imported live  pigs  or carcases if they  hold quota certificates    issued by the country of origin of those pigs or carcases.   It is inherent in an  effective quota system  that there must bepreventive or penal machinery to secure that the quota  is notexceeded ; it is equally  necessary, in the interest both of the  con-sumer and of the industry, to  secure that, within the limits  oftolerance, the quota is filled.   We therefore recommend, in the caseof the home quota (we have already made a similar recommendation in the case of import quotas), that if, in any period, home supplies are insufficient to fill the home quota, then in tho succeeding quotaperiod the home quota,  irrespective of  the number of contracts,shall not be allowed to exceed by more than 10 per cent, the actualoutput in the period of default ; we recommend, further, that, forany such default, the responsibility of individual curers, as provedby  a  comparison of the quantity of the  contract pigs  delivered tothem and of the bacon  sold by them, shall be visited upon them inthe form of reduced individual shares in the home quota.    We attach equal importance in the  case of the home output,as in  the case of imports,  to the  equalization of supplies throughoutthe year, and consider, therefore, that the home quota should  begiven in  terms of so many hundredweights a month ; this will need to be subject to the same tolerance of 10 per cent, from month tomonth, which we  consider, and later recommend as, a necessaryterm  of the individual contracts.  We appreciate also that seasonalfeatures  in market demand may need to be reflected in the monthlyquota figures.    As indicated above, we recommend, also, that the Quota AdvisoryCommittee should have  an  overriding power to recommend  an arbitrary increase or decrease  of the home  quota in the publicinterest.    19.   Volume and Distribution of Import and  Home Quotas. Estimating the quantity  of home-produced  bacon and hams avail-able  for consumption  in the United Kingdom * in recent years at approximately 1,750,000  cwt., total annual  supplies have averaged 10,670,000 cwt. over the 6-year period  1925-30 ; the year 1931has been omitted because  of its abnormality.  There seems justifica-tion for regarding this figure as a normal annual supply at the present    * After deducting animal exports of domestic produce averaging about 45,000 cwt.
level  of  population,  and we  recommend  that  supplies should bemaintained at this figure  at  present.   It will no doubt be said that the rate of increase in bacon supplies during the last two  years  is evidence that even now there is not too much  bacon  on  the market, and we would concede  that, atlower price levels, even larger quantities  could without doubt be sold,  but wo are not  convinced that these increased supplies wouldbo forthcoming indefinitely at the level  of prices  which has beenruling and  must rule if they are to be absorbed.   In fact, we wouldrepeat that the period of readjustment to more normal price and supply levels  must come eventually, whether or not any action istaken on this Report : as we have said, there arc indications that theprocess has started already.   The  exact basis  of the distribution  of  the quota among in-dividual  countries is  not material  to the Commission^ proposals and will be affected  by  a.  number  of possible considerations witliwhich we have no concern : but having  regard to our conception of the quota as an instrument of constructive value to tho exporting country  as  well as to the importing country,  we  would  suggestthat,  in selecting  the basis, due consideration  should be given tothe interests of those countries which had struggled to maintain and to build  up  efficient industries under the  difficult conditionsruling in recent years.   If total supplies were to be stabilized at 10,670,000 cwt., andif a satisfactory basis of  allocation of import quotas were adojrted,it  would still be impossible to estimate the  actual percentagerelationship of quotas to the  basic period until some date shortlypreceding the  first  quota period.   Apart from any preferential treatment  accorded  to the Dominions, the share of the  UnitedKingdom woidd not  be  known until the closing of tho period forsigning contracts ;  thereafter,  the  uncertainty  would not  rule to anything like  the  same extent if the home quota is  permitted an automatic increase of 10 per cent, every  four months and  so longas home  producers avail themselves of this potential increase.   It has  already been explained  that,  for some years,  importquotas will not need to be changed  more  frequently than once a year to reflect  the four-monthly  increases in the home output for which we have provided.   20.  Acmiinistration  of  Quotas. The operation  of  a  baconquota system will involve  certain highly responsible  duties, thochief  being                                         ...       (a)  the determination of, or the making of recommendations    as regards, the periodic readjustment of home and individual    import quotas, and  of total supplies ;       (b)  the protection from exploitation of consumer and other    public  interests ;  and       (c)  the prevention  of evasion of quota regulations.
These duties will need to be performed by or on the initiative of a body, judicial in character and in function, and we have suggested for this purpose  a Quoin Advisory Committee, similar in constitution and method of  operation to the existing Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee.  It  is not our function to consider whether the quotaprinciple is likely to be extended to other commodities, agriculturalor industrial,  but we venture to exceed our  terms of reference tothe extent  of suggesting that  any body specifically charged by legislation with  bacon and ham quota  determination should havebroad  powers which  will empower it similarly to  function in theevent of it being decided that the supply of any other commodityshould in future be subject to quantitative regulation.  We antici-pate that the necessary  quota legislation would  provide for the implementation  of  the Quota Advisory Committee&apos;s  recommenda-tions  by Statutory Order, as  in  the  case of the Import duties advisory Committee.  The  principles  on which we suggest  the quota Advisory Committee should base its recommendations havebeen stated in paragraph 12.   The Quota Advisory Committee will  require to consult represen-tatives of the homo  pig industry, of the bacon  importers, and ofthe distributors on  such technical points as, for  instance,  the productive  capacity   and efficiency of different countries,  the seasonal  nature  of supply and  demand  and provision therefor, the trend of demand in  relation to the demand  for other meats, thequality of supplies of various origins, and details of administration.In the same way,  the home industry,  the importers and the  dis-distributors will, from time to time,  wish  to make representations tothe  Quota  Advisory Committee.  On  the   home side, the  co-ordinating link  would be the  Pig Industry  Development Board ;on the import side,  we suggest a Bacon Imports Advisor)/ Committee,consisting of  representatives of importers and distributors with a neutral chairman.   Reference  has already been made  to the  probability that thechecking of the  volume of bacon imports will be carried out at the ports ; the checking of the home output could be done through aninspection  of  the records  of bacon factories.   In the case  of imports, it would seem necessary to issue quotacertificates.  These certificates could be issued either  to the shipperor to  the  importer,  but we believe that the former alternative would be  preferable.  Just as we desire  to encourage  efficientmarketing in  this country and believe this to be synonymous withsome degree of central control at least over quality  standards and terms of sale so we wish to avoid any recommendations likely to discourage similar action in other countries.   We therefore recom-mend  that  licences to export  to the United  Kingdom the annualquota volume of bacon should be  issued to the Government of any country  which  has  established a  reputable  organization  to  ad-minister the  sub-allocation of  these licences, and that from these
countries bacon should only be admitted if accompanied by docu-ments  bearing the  authorization  of  the  Government   or an approved  organization.  It has, however,  been pointed out thatthe restriction of imports creates an opportunity for largo distributorsin this country to secure  a monopoly of certain sources of supply to the serious prejudice of small retailers, and it has been suggested to us that this situation should be mot by admitting to this countryonly bacon consigned to  a registered  importer.  We  have  been unable to satisfy ourselves as to the reality of this potential danger,but recommend that  the powers  given  to the  Quota AdvisoryCommittee, or the  appropriate  Jlinistcr, should  be such as toenable this danger to be  removed  if  it  should materialize.   Forexample, it might be possible to meet such a  situation by a tem-porary  removal from selected  sources  of supply of the  quota restrictions upon them, or by the temporary issue of import licenceson the advice of the Bacon Imports Advisory Committee.   We  have also  considered whether any alternative machinery should be created for use  in the case of tho failure of any countryto control  the sub-allotment of quota certificates, but we  considerthat the granting of a quota to any countiy should  be dependentupon  the  creation in that country  of the machinery for the fairallotment  and control of quota certificates.   The machinery to  control  the  home  quota  should be simple.The permitted output of each registered curer would bo in pro-portion to the volume of home-produced pigs which he  has  con-tracted to  buy, and he should be liable to severe penalties if the inspection  of his books shows that in any quota or sub-quota periodlie has sold bacon in excess of  his quota unless that  excess can be supported  by vouchers of the  two following  descriptions :         (a) Export Licences.  These should be issued on request,    but machinery  should be  provided to ensure that bacon in    respect of which export licences have been issued is, in fact,    exported.        (6) Import Quota  Certificates.  It  is permitted to certain    countries, wliich do not come under the prohibition on account    of  foot-and-mouth disease, to export live pigs  and  fresh    or frozen pork to this country, and it is the practice  of curers    in this country to manufacture bacon from these pork supplies.    The importation of  live pigs and pork will not be restricted    by a  bacon quota, but their purchase for manufacture  into and    sale as bacon will, in practice, be subject to  the quota restriction    upon the home  bacon output.  We therefore recommend that    bacon  quota certificates  issued  to  any  country  permitted    to export live pigs or pork to this country shall be valid either    to^cover consignments of  bacon or  of live pigs  or carcases    destined  for conversion into bacon ; in tho latter  case,  they    will be acquired by the home bacon curer and will be presented
    by him as vouchers covering an excess of  bacon beyond hi-.    home quota.   We consider that the administration, including the verificationof the home  quota, should  be performed  by the  Pig Industry-Development  Board,  to the satisfaction of the Quota AdvisoryCommittee.   We are advised that our quota  proposals accord with  treaty obligations.         PART V.-CONTRACT RECOMMENDATIONS.   21. Contracts. The  principle   behind  the  contract  system and  the reason why the Commission believe contracts to be anessential concurrent  of  the  quota in tho particular circumstancesof the home  bacon  industry have  been stated in paragraph  14.Wo have emphasized that  contracts should be the basis  of thehome quota and that a basic price should be attached to contracts ;these  suggestions need now to  be elaborated.   22.  Basic Contract  Price. If,  as wo recommend,  the homequota period is to  last one year and  the home quota is to be basedupon contracts made before the quota year starts, then it is obviousthat producers will  be  required  to  contract to deliver to baconfactories numbers of pigs not yet bom.  Under the conditions rulingtoday, such  an operation would be highly hazardous,  and beforethe system can be introduced,  the hazard must, as far as possible,be removed.   One of the main problems before the Commission was to reconcile the conflicting interests  of pig producers and bacon curers.   On theone hand, it  was  impossible to recommend a system of contractsunless those  contracts carried  a  guarantee that  any producer of reasonable  efficiency  would not incur a loss through his contract for reasons,  such as the  high costs of feeding-stuffs or the weakness of the bacon market, which were  beyond his control.  On the otherhand, it  would be  equally useless to  ask  the bacon curers to accept an obligation to pay to producers  a margin of profit unjustifiedby the price at which bacon can be sold.  We therefore  determined to recommend a firm basic  price for pigs limited to and  varyingwith a standard cost of production, but not including any element of profit  which we  think should  be variable and negotiable from timeto time ; we suggest  below a formula which  fulfils these conditions.Moreover, we recommend that  this or any other formula shall onlybe varied after one year&apos;s notice by either producers or curers.  Thedetails of any formula would, of course, be a matter for  negotiation between  the Pigs and Bacon Boards.   The  adoption of   these  recommendations  should  be  un-accompanied by risk to either producers  or curers.  The regulationof imports,  which is fundamental to these proposals, will  preventthe excessive competition that has  occurred in tho past and will prevent any attempt on the part of overseas shippers to stifle the
home industry.   We do  not believe  that,  with this  protection,curers will be unable over a period to sell their bacon  at a price which will permit them to  pay farmers at least the bare cost of producing pigs ; indeed, if  we had thought that  this guarantee,in all the circumstances, imposed upon bacon  curers a risk whichthey should not be asked to accept, we should have felt in some doubt whether the home bacon industry was one that either couldor should be helped.   To producers, on the other hand, the formulawill offer reasonable  security against loss, and it is with the objectof making this security effective and useful,  not only to the feederbut to the  breeder, who has to look further ahead, that we suggestthat the formula should be modified only after one year&apos;s  notice.As we have stated, however, the formula is not intended to providefor the pig producers profit; the extent and even the existenceof this must depend upon the strength of the bacon market.   If, as we anticipate, the effect of the quota is to stabilize prices at. a level which will permit curcrs to  pay a price  higher than theformula price, then it will be the duty of the Pigs Marketing Board,by periodic negotiation with bacon curcrs, to secure this additionaljnice.  It follows, therefore, that the contracting producer may beraking a risk as to his profit; it will be a condition of  his contractthat he should receive any addition to the basic price that maybeagreed nationally from time to time, but  he  may  not know inadvance what that addition will be when his pigs  come to be soldor whether it will be altered from its current rate before liis pigsare sold.  Alternatively, it  might be possible to give the producerthe option of accepting a profit-margin fixed before and unalterableduring the period of his contract;  in  this case, the curer would becarrying a greater risk, which one would  expect to see reflected inthe  profit  margin.   We have referred in paragraph 16 to the inclusion among the func-tions of the Pig Industry Development Board of that of arbitratingbetween the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Boards in the event of theirfailure to agree upon contract terms and prices.  Before making this suggestion, we  considered other  channels of arbitration and reached  the conclusion that the existence of the three independent members would  make  the  Pig Industry Development Board, or possibly the independent section of it, a suitable body to be givenstatutory power, at  the request of either board, to make an awardwhich shall  be  binding  upon  all  j^roclucers and  curers  who electto make contracts for delivery during the  period covered by theaward.    23.   A Suggested Price Formula. As  we  have already said,any formula must be a matter for negotiation, but a possible formula which fulfils the conditions advocated in the preceding paragraphis that  :         The minimum price of a bacon pig of standard specification     &quot; ex farm &quot; shall be  35s. per pig plus lCfSrZ. per score of 201b.   518S                                                     B2
     dead weight for every  Is. per cwt.  in  the average  cost of a     defined ration* during the four months  preceding the month     of delivery.   It will be seen that this formula has  two parts, one constantand  the  other variable.   The constant part includes (a) the cost of the wcaner and (b)overheads from weaning to slaughter.   It is  made up as follows :            (a) Wcaner :                          s.   d.

(a) Assuming eight pigs weaned per litter and the consumption of     12 ewt. of food  by  tho sow during pregnancy and suckling (this figure    also to cover a share of the food-cost of tho boar), a 25-lb. weancr would    require 1-1 cwt. of meal.  This is charged at a constant price of 10*. per    cwt. (or  15s. for liewt.), which includes an element of profit or loss    to the&apos; producer, according as  tho current costs of food are below Or    abovo this price.  Subtracting this 15s. from the Pig Industry Councils    figure of 25s. as the cost of a weanor, there remains a sum of 10s. which    would represent all the costs of the wcaner except food.       We arc aware that, statistically, more accurate results woidd be shown    if  the food-cost of tho weaner were calculated at current rates ;  but    we believe that, over a period, tho  figure we suggest is not likely to prove    unreasonable, and wo think that the inclusion of the total wearier-cost    as a constant makes for simplicity in the formula.       (6) The figure of  10s. compares  with the  Pig Industry  Councirs    estimate  of Is. Gd. per score i.e., 10s. Gd. on a 7-score  pig, or 12s. on    an 8-score pig, to cover overheads from weaning to slaughter.    The  variable part of the formula is based on  the assumption that a 7-score pig, in increasing from 25 lb.  (weight of  weaner) to 185-190 lb. live weight, consumes 6 cwt.  of concentrates on a normal ration.  This actually amounts to a consumption of 4-2 lb. of food per 1 lb. live weight gain from weaning to slaughter.  Given suitable stock and housing and a scientific ration, a feeder of normal efficiency should be able  to maintain this  rate of gain.  The  Pig Industry Council assumed a gain  of 1 lb. per 4 lb. of meal, and this has long been regarded in the pig industry as an attainable  ideal.  It is not claimed that 6  cwt. of food per  bacon pig is an  average  for this country.  The aim should rather  be to fix upon a standard ration which, if properly used, might be expected to give this rate of gain, and to base pig prices upon it.  It is not, however, the function of the Commission to recommend an actual basic ration.   * The phrase &quot; defined  ration &quot; does not imply a ration which must beused by all foeders but a typical ration  which is used as tho basis of contract -prico calculation.
   A simple calculation  indicates that for every  Is. per  cwt.  inthe cost of the ration, the feeders&apos; costs are 6s. per  7-score pig  or&quot;-shilling (10&apos;3fZ.) per  score  dead weight.   It has been suggested to tho Commission that provision shouldbe made  for  substituting given proportions of other  foods* foreach element in the defined ration, in the event of tho former beingcheaper.  This seems sound in principle.  It would, for example,be unsound to peg  the price of pigs  to barley-meal  if exceptional circumstances made that food much dearer than, say, maize-meal,which is an efficient substitute up to certain  limits.   The use of the formula, with any given level  of  feed-costs,results in a different price per score for pigs of different weights;for example, with food-stuffs at 7s. Gel. per cwt., the following resultsarc shown :     Comments upon this feature have already been made by someof the witnesses whom we have consulted.  The explanation lies inthe fact that overheads, which are largely constant whatever the weight of  the pig, have so been treated in the formula ;   besidesbeing  accurate in  the matter  of costing, this  method  of  treatingoverheads  has the merit of encouraging the light-weight  side that isin general demand, at any rate for the Wiltshire trade. If, however,it is  desired  that  as between defined weight ranges  there shallbe a uniform price per score, the addition representing the feeder&apos;sprofit  could  be added in such  a way as to produce a flat price perscore for all pigs within the weight ranges thought most desirable for the Wiltshire and Midland trades, respectively, with deductionsfor pigs of less suitable  weight.   We have referred in our formula to a minimum price  of a baconpig of standard specification ;  the  significance  of this is that theprice paid should be applicable only to a standard carcase, accordingto a defined specification, and that it should be subject to additionsor deductions in accordance with carcase quality and weight range.This policy has been advocated by the Pig Industry Council, andit is one to which we attach the greatest importance.   It may be found  in the interest of farmers and  curers that  the basic price should provide  for other additions or deductions,  inrespect of  such matters as regularity or seasonality of delivery or,even, factory-throughput in relation to  capacity.  Alternatively,these matters  may be considered periodically at the same time as   * Published price  quotations for feeding-stuffs are generally ex-mill orox-store in 2-ton lots or more ; it must be taken into consideration, in working out the formula, to what oxtent these are tho prices actually paid by farmers.Dead Weight of PigPrice per  Pig.Price per Score  s. d. 11  5 11  1 10 107 scoro ...7 score 10 lb.S score s. d.SO  0S3  3SO  5

The  Contract Period. -We  have  considered  the  coni-parative advantages of  short, medium and long-term  contract-periods.   The short-term contract of, say, throe or six months is open tothe great  objection  that it creates too many opportunities  forfeeders to  switch from bacon to pork,  and vice versa, in search ofa temporary advantage,  to the great detriment of all plans for  theordered expansion of the home bacon output; this point is referredto more fully later on.  Moreover, the principle  of basing the homequota upon actual contracts makes it  essential that the contractperiod shall not be shorter  than the quota period, and  it wouldcomplicate the administration and add to the uncertainty of importquotas if the homo  quota period were shorter than  that  of  theimport quota.  The sole advantage of  a short-term contract and this advantageis limited to contracts not exceeding four months in length is thatit  dispenses  with the necessity for contracting for pigs not yetweaned ;  this  reduces  the individual  risk of contract-default a risk  against which provision must be  made  in  all contracts, andparticularly in the case of those of longer duration (see also paragraph28).   We recommend  a yearly contract  period,  coinciding with  ayearly quota  period.  The effect of the adoption  of  this recom-mendation would be that, before the close of each calendar year(at the latest date which would allow  time for the arrangement of import quotas), producers would be required to sign   contracts inrespect of all pigs which they desired to consign to  bacon factoriesduring the coming year.   Once a new quota and contract year had started, no more contracts for delivery within  that year could be signed. Although this system has the great advantage  that it gives a farmer security for at  least a year at a time,  it presents certainobvious difficulties discussed later which we believe can be over-come.  We are fortified  in this  belief  by the consultations  whichwe have had with producers from  all parts of the country.   We do not, however, exclude the  possibility  that, to  manyproducers, and particularly those who both breed and feed, there willbe attractions in a contract for a longer period  than one year,  andwe think that such contracts  should be encouraged.   25. The Contract Route. Contracts coidd  be made betweenthe individual  producer  and  the individual  curer i.e.,  the  &quot; directmethod &quot; or  they  could be between  the  producer and the PigsMarketing Board on the  one hand, and between  the  Pigs MarketingBoard and the individual curer on the  other i.e., the  &quot; collectivemethod &quot; ; we have given  considerable thought to  the relativemerits of  these two alternative contract  routes.
   We think it essential that contract prices should be determinedby negotiation between authorized representatives of pig producers and bacon curers, respectively, and that the agreed terms should apply to all contract sales throughout the United Kingdom.  If thisis accepted, it would seem that the bargaining strength of individual members of  the  two groups is not a relevant  factor when con-sidering between  whom the contracts should be made.   The  direct feeder-curer contract route has certain advantages.It encourages the  continuation of  the personal  connexions thatexist to-day  between the  feeder and the factory.  It  places uponcurers the  responsibility of getting contracts and of arranging forthe equalization of deliveries from week  to week.  It involves theminimum of administrative interference between the parties.  Onthe other hand, it places upon curers the risk of having contractedto buy more pigs than the home  quota subsequently permits themto sell  as  bacon.  Moreover,  by  permitting  curers  to contract to buy  pigs  wherever they wish, it encourages criss-cross traffic in pigs over long  distances and the retention by factories of agents in all parts of the  country, both of which must add to marketingcosts.   The feeder Pigs Board curer route  also has advantages.  Itwould permit control over the movement of pigs from farm tonearest  suitable factory.   Moreover, the administrative work  on contracts has to be done by someone, and it could probably be done as economically by the Pigs Board as by, say, CO firms of curers.The fact that, under the direct method, the expense would be borne in the  first  instance by  curers would not, in reality,  prevent itfalling ultimately on  the  producer, for every item of curers&apos; costhelps to lessen the price which they can afford to pay for pigs.   The allotment of contracts to curers, under the collective method,could be done en bloc, by areas, and, in the case of factories whichare compelled to draw supplies of pigs from all parts of the UnitedKingdom, contracts could be allotted with an eye to certain ad hoccollecting stations.   It would, however,  place  on the Board the difficult task of allotting contract pigs among the competing curersfairly and with clue regard to the  curers&apos; efficiency.   It has  also  been necessary to consider other factors, such aswhich S3&apos;stem would be more equitable, which would  give moreencouragement to the most efficient factories  and to  the rationaldevelopment of the curing industry,  and  which would facilitate the operation of the quota system.  We have not found it easy to determine on  which side the balance of advantage lies, and in recommending, as we do,  the adoption in principle  of the directfeeder-curer method, we have been greatly influenced by a desireto leave undisturbed  as  much as possible of the existing tradestructure and methods.   We find it necessary to qualify this  recommendation  for several reasons.   Firstly, it has been  represented  to us by  bacon  eurers   51SS                                                     B-
that they would be glad to be relieved of tho necessity for enforcingcontracts  against  individual  producers,  and we ourselves seeadvantages in and recommend  the assumption of that duty by the pig producers&apos; own marketing  board.  We think, secondly, that itwill be wise to require that all contracts shall be registered by thePigs Marketing Board before they become valid ;  this will permit the Board to ensure that all contracts adhere to the standard con-ditions and prices, and that contracts are not unwittingly  made inexcess of the maximum possible home quota, the volume of whichwill be known in advance (see paragrajm IS).  Thirdly, provision has to be made  against the normal mortality, among growing pigswhich producers have contracted to supply, and for the  protectionof contracting producers who  have defaulted  on  their contracts for reasons for which they are not responsible.  These  points are referred  to in paragraph 2S, but we recommend,  as part of thesolution  of these difficulties, that the Pigs Marketing Board should retain under its own control a reserve pool of contracts from which to replace casualties.  Lastly,  we foresee that two classes of pro-ducers might find difficulty in securing contracts direct with curers,these being the very  small producers and the breeders who want along contract over several years ; we have accordingly made pro-vision to enable these producers to contract with their  marketingboard.   The machinery which  we recommend which is incorporated in paragraphs 37 and 38 of the Pigs Marketing Scheme (appendix a) preserves the principle of direct contracts between feeders andcurers, but permits the departure from that  principle in the casesdescribed above.   We suggest  that,  at the joint request of a pro-producer  and a curer,  the  Pigs Marketing Board shall  be required,with  certain  qualifications,  to buy pigs from the producer and tosell them to the  curer.  Thus, it is the Board which actually signscontracts with curers and feeders, respectively, though both curersand feeders retain entire liberty, in the one case, to send pigs toany factory  and,  in  the other, to buy pigs from any producer.We suggest also that the Board  shall have general power to buyand sell  pigs, which  will permit the maintenance of the  reservejoool and the making of contracts by the Board with  those two classes of producers,  mentioned above, who we think  may have difficulty in arranging contracts  with curers.   26.  Payment  of  Transport   Costs. We  have   considered whether  the  nationally agreed price for a i standard rjig should be&quot; ex farm &quot;  or  &quot; at factory.&quot; If the  national price  were  &quot; atfactory,&quot; then, as  no farmer could sell for, and no curer  could buyat,  other than the national price, farmers would tend to  contract with the  nearest factory.   Factories situated in pig-producing areas would therefore  probably  be able to obtain  contracts up to full capacity.  Curers located outside such areas (whether they operate
large urban factories or small country  units)  would tend to  boshort of supplies.   Thus, farmers not in  the vicinity of factories,and  factories outside major pig-producing areas, would both tendto be prejudiced.   On the other hand, if the national price were &quot; ex farm.&quot; therewould be no break with the current practice according to whichcurers to-day habitually pay transport charges, and though factoriessituated in producing districts would, as to-day, obtain pigs at lessfreight-cost, the ability of large and efficient factories to pay rather more for their  pigs would enable them to contract for pigs fromgreater distances and in competition with local factories in producingareas.   This  would, of course,  involve  some overlapping of  the regions  of supply of different factories.  There is also the objection that farmers, situated in those parts of  the country from whichrail  charges to the nearest  factory  are  abnormally&apos;  high, might find  difficulty in securing  contracts ; this difficulty is clue to  theuneven  distribution of factories  throughout the country,  and wosuggest that it should be given weight by the Pig Industry Dcvelop-mcnt Board when considering the licensing of new factory construc-tion.   We  think that the balance of equity  rests  on the side of  an&quot; ex farm &quot; national price, and that this system would also favour the more efficient factories ; we therefore  recommend its adoption.   ii.  Operation of the  Contract System. Briefly,  we  visualizethe contract system  working in  the following way: Before  thebeginning of each quota year, producers would contract to sell, andcurers to buy, pigs upon the basis of the  price formula, subject toany profit addition that may from time to time be fixed by national aggreement.   These contracts would specify, inter alia, the month of delivery-;while producers,  particularly those  on a large  scale, would  be encouraged to  deliver equal monthly quantities, contracts  could also  be  made for deliveries only  in one or more specified  months.Shortly before the beginning of the quota y7ear,  the register of contracts for that year would be closed and the sum total would be reported to the Quota Advisory Committee by the  Pig industry development Board, with a request that an equivalent home baconquota should  be granted.  We  have suggested in paragraph  is some rules which  should govern  the quantitative relationship of contracts to the home quota, but have said that  we do not considerthat these general rules should override the ultimate power of the quota Advisory Committee to recommend an arbitrary increase or decrease in  the home quota on  grounds of public interest.  Theprospect of any such arbitrary alteration, however, should be soremote  as to enable the Pigs Marketing Board  to estimate closelywhat will be the maximum home  quota in any ensuing period andto take steps to secure that  part of the quota is not  lost  for lack
of contracts  and,  equally, that the number of contracts accepteddoes not exceed the home  quota.   We consider that the Pigs Marketing Board should keep a register of contracts  made in accordance with paragraph 3S of our draftPigs Marketing Scheme (Appendix A),  and we provide that theBoard should be empowered to refuse to register further  contracts for any quota period, or any part of a quota period, if in its opinion there were a likelihood of the total number of contracts registeredexceeding tho number required to  fill  the home quota.  Moreover,unless steps were taken to prevent it, there would always be a dangerof deliveries  under the contracts fluctuating from month to month,with perhaps a pronounced seasonal swing. We  assume that the quota Advisory Committee will overcome this tendency by makingthe home quota conditional upon the spreading of contracts reason-ably equally over the year, and the  Pigs  Marketing  Board will,therefore, need to keep careful watch to make sure that the contractsbooked for any one  month are not seriously out of line with thosebooked for the other months.   It is possible that, at  times, the contracts offered by producerswill exceed the number required to fill  the home quota ; in suchcases, we think it  important at  all costs to preserve the  stability of total supplies, and the principle of &quot; first  come, first  served &quot;should rule ;  this will act as an encouragement  to early contractingand to long-term contracts, at the  expense of those  producers who might prefer to wait upon the course  of the pork market.   -28. Protection  against Contract Default. Any  contract for a longer period than seven or eight months must be partly in respectof pigs  not yet born.  The main difficulty  attaching to long-term contracts from the feeders&apos;standpoint is, therefore, the risk of smalllitters and heavy  losses  of young pigs before  weaning.  Over thewhole country, however,  variations in the birth  and  death  rates are not  very wide, and it is the individual^ rather than the collectiverisk which has to  be guarded against.   It is, of course, essential that the individual producer should be protected from incurring jienalties in the case of an  involuntarycontract default.  This could be done in several ways, viz. :         (i)  The rate of delivery under contracts could be subject    to a total tolerance of 5 per cent, over the year and to a tolerance    of 10 per cent, from month to month.  A tolerance  alone would    not suffice, for  if the tolerance is to be adequate for the pro-    tecrion of the producer, it must  be excessive for the stability    of  the scheme.        (ii) There  might  be what- woidd amount to  a sj-stem of    insurance  against damages through involuntary default.        (iii) The Pigs Marketing Board  could  and, in our oxainion,    would need to,  control a pool  of surplus contracts from which    to  replace net deficiencies which are bound to occur.   Such of
     these  surplus pigs as were not  required  to  replace contract     casualties would have to be sold in the pork  markets.    The three methods could be worked in combination.  Subject tothe payment of a levy on each contracted pig, a producer would beexonerated from  all subsequent involuntary default, provided thathe  complied with the Pigs Marketing BoarcUs instructions as toreporting immediately the cause of any default.  The Pigs Market-ing Board  would thus assume any liability for the default.  Theliability  would take two  forms :  firstly, there  would be  the  legalaspects of  the contract, and, secondly, the practical need to main-tain the supplies  at  a  level which will not result in any reductionof tho home quota.  The Board would on both counts  be anxiousto replace the missing supplies and could do so  (i)  from  the  reservepool or (ii) by buying pigs in the open market; in either  case, any loss should be financed from the levy fund.    Where  replacements proved impossible, legal damages,  due tothe curer,  would  be a charge upon the levy  fund.    Wilful default should expose e  ther party  to the contract to tholegal con equences.    29. Rate of Contract Deliveries. We have  suggested  thatcontract deliveries should be subject  to a  total tolerance of 5 percent,  and to a monthly  tolerance of 10 per cent, on  the  agreedrate of delivery.   This monthly  tolerance could  operate  in  the following circumstances (fractions of a pig counting  as one  pig) :         (i)  A producer supplying, say, 20 pigs a month throughout    the year coidd supply between IS and 22 in any month, provided    that his total yearly deliveries were between 22S  and 252.        (ii) A producer contracting to supply 12 pigs in June and     12 in December could be allowed to supply,  say, two  pigs in    May or July and 10 in June, and  be afforded a similar privilege    over his December deliveries.        (iii) A  producer contracting  to supply 20  pigs  a month    with a further 30 pigs in September,  October and November,     would enjoy  tho tolerance  on  the  regular  monthly  supply     and a further tolerance during  the three autumn months.   In  recommending that contracts  should specify the month of delivery, we have  had regard to the fact that, at any time withinthe month, the deliveries  may take the form  of pigs at  the  bottomor the top of the weight-range jiermitted by the contract.   This con-sideration must make it easier for producers to deliver in the specifiedmonth.   30. Contracts and the Small Producer. The experience afforded by milk and sugar beet, together with evidence given to tis on behalfof small Welsh and  Scottish producers, has satisfied us that evensmall farmers are accustomed to contracts of considerable complexity,and that they will be willing, and even anxious, to make contracts.
The difficulties of fitting small producers into a contract scheme arcof a more material character.    Tho very small producer who may only feed one or two pigsat a time may find curers unwilling to contract with him, on accountof the trouble being out of proportion to the value of the business.His pig-feeding operations may be so intermittent that he himselfmay have difficulty in estimating in advance when he is likely tobe  able to deliver fat pigs to a factory.    There  are, however, several possible ways in wliich these diffi-cidties may  be minimized.  We are informed  that, even to-day,some  curers encourage and even organize local pig clubs, the market-ing of whose produce is  organized  by a secretary who is paid acommission on all sales. The development of this system, combined with one of group contracts, would be of  value to small producers.Wc think,  further,  that there will  be  considerable  scope forauctioneers  and  other  persons  to organize group contracts amongfarmers,  and there  is nothing to  prevent auctioneers with  a regular  trade in fat  pigs from making  contracts with  the PigsMarketing Board, either as principals or as agents for producers.    Wc think, also, that the Pigs Marketing Board should always boprepared to make contracts with small producers who have difficultyin making a  direct approach to curers, and that the Board should use all existing agencies  and, if necessary, create fresh ones, fororganizing the  assembly and shipment of small lots of pigs (see also paragraph 39).    31. The Contract System and the Trade in Stores. The reductionof disease and  the equalization of supplies throughout the year andfrom  year to year are two reasons why producers should be encouragement-aged  to pursue a regular  breeding policy.  Nevertheless, under theconditions ruling in the United Kingdom, the breeding and sale  of stores are useful functions and no scheme  could  operate  which did not provide for this trade.  Under our scheme, the feeder cancontract to  sell  bacon pigs to a factory having previously madea contract with  a  breeder of stores or having taken his chance  ofbeing able to buy his stores in the open market when he needs them.Alternatively, a contract with a factory could be made by the breederand could be transferred at the time of sale to the feeder.  Thistransferability of contracts woidd also tend to make  the schememore elastic in other ways.    We  believe that this  procedure  will meet the reasonable needsof breeders and feeders of store pigs even though it will no  longer be possible for producers who have not  contracts to buy-in storepigs during any quota period (for delivery to a factory within thatperiod) as a means of converting seasonal or other surpluses of cropsor  dairy by-products, unless  (i) to  replace contract casualties.(ii) the store pigs were accompanied by contracts, or (Hi) there were a factory demand for pigs for &quot; export &quot; bacon.
       Reaction of the Contract System upon the Pork Market. Pig prices and feed prices normally follow inverse cycles (see para-graph 8).   When pig prices are high, feed prices am low, and vice versa.   It is proposed to peg the price of bacon pigs to feed prices, butnot so the price  of pork pigs.  Therefore, when bacon-pig prices arelow, pork-pig prices may be expected to be high, and vice versa.It is probable that until some scheme for stabilizing pork production is devised, tho cycle of pork-pig supi^lies will continue, although itis difficult to anticipate what will be tho effect on the pork  marketof an expanding pig population primarily7 caused by an increasingbacon industry.   If contract periods were as  short as four or six months, feeders,before making contracts for bacon  pigs, might prefer to wait and see what were the relative prospects of the pork and bacon markets.If bacon-pig  prices  were up and pork prices down at the beginningof a short-term contract  period, all would wish to make baconcontracts.  If the  opposite  were the case, some would go for  porkeven  though by so doing  they would depress  the pork  marketbefore most  of  them could get their pigs  on to it.  Under theseconditions, curers would never  be certain of supplies, and the conse-quent necessity frequently to  vary the home  and  import  quotaswould destroy the prospect of  a methodical  expansion of the home industry and might lead to gross deficiency of total supplies causedby continued instability abroad.  The shorter the contract period the greater the opportunity the feeder  would  have-of &quot;rushingfrom pork to bacon,&quot; or vice versa, and the more difficult it would beto segregate  the pork and bacon-pig markets and to eliminate the pig cycle, which is  the curse of both and particularly  the  latter :hence our  recommendation  that  the contract period should notbe less  than a  year.   Even a yearly  contract period  will not entirely get  over thedifficulty7.  Various palliatives  can  be suggested, even if none canbe  advocated viz. :         (i)  The  contract period might be  really long four y7ears    should cover a pig and feed cycle.        (ii) Part of the food-cost risk might be carried by the pro-    producer, thus lessening the  possible discrepancy between  pork    and bacon  prices.        (iii) A similar result could  be attained  by7  weighting the     defined ration * with foods (e.g. potatoes) which do not follow    the food-price  cy7cle.        (iv) Allowance might be made for pork prices as part of the    contract formula.   * The phrase &quot; defined ration &quot; does not imply a ration which must be used by all feeders but a typical ration which is used as the basis of contract pricecalculation see paragraph 23.
   If, however,  the danger  from the  alternate  attraction  andrepulsion of the pork market were as serious as it can easily be made out to be,  then we should have  to come to the conclusion that the orderly development of a  bacon industry under these  proposal is  impossible.   But there are considerations on tho other side.  In the  firstplace, every increase in tho pig population of this country will lessen the attraction of the pork market by converting it more  and more to a surplus  outlet; this we believe to be  an inevitable concurrentof an expanding bacon industry.  In the second place, the scheme will  offer to producers of  bacon pigs a security  which  they havenever had before, but with the knowledge that this security depends on their playing  up ;  if, to any considerable extent,  producersare likely  to persist in vacillating from  one  market to another,our proposals must be, as they in fact arc, such as will protect theconsumer and,  so  far as possible, enable the protection of the quotato be enjoyed  by those producers who remain in continuous pro-duction of contract pigs.  In the third place, the quota proposals will  offer the curers something  to work for, with the result  that every factory will have the strongest incentive to conduct propa-ganda to secure steady supplies.  If the concerted efforts of thecurers and the Pigs Marketing  Board should fail on any occasion to prevent a serious switch-over from bacon to pork, tho  penaltywill be visited upon the industry in the form of a lower home quota ;this  should convince all parties wherein lies their real interest.   Finally, if the above considerations do not avail, it may become necessary to widen the scope of the scheme to permit tho sales ofall pigs to be regulated ; this alternative should be avoided at the start but would be a less difficidt problem after practical experience had   been gained of  the  regulation  of  the   bacon side   of theindustry.   33.   Contract  and  Home Quota Provisional Arrangements. Under a system of  yearly contract and quota  periods, the fate of-the bacon industry, and of every unit, whether  producing or curingbacon pigs, will depend for a whole year upon contracts made beforethe  year starts.   We  have considered, therefore, whether special provision might not be necessary when the scheme Avas first intro-duced.   Accustomed as many farmers are to the signing of  contracts,there will  be some who will hang back through doubt of the pros-pects  or fail  to  make contracts  through ignorance  of  the full implications of the scheme.  There  will be others who, with theintention of going  whole-heartedly into the production of baconpigs, will require  time to increase their breeding stock and to get it in production.  We think, therefore, that it would bo unwisefor  the  first yearly contract and quota  period to start before
January 1st, 1934.  On tho othor hand,  we do not think that theexpansion of home production under tho shelter of the quota shouldlie delayed unnecessarily for a single month.  We therefore recom-mend that there should be an initial contract and quota period start-ing, say, on July 1st, 1933, and lasting until December 31st ofthat year, but that, in view of the possibility that the contractsystem will not have &quot; got  into its stride &quot; in the provisional period,rhe number of contracts made during the provisional period shouldnot be  allowed to limit the number ranking for home quota  whichmay subsequently be made for the first full  contract and  quotaperiod  (starting January 1st, 1934).   Ti our proposals are generally acceptable  to  the Governmentand  to the industry,  there will bo an  immense  amount of  pre-iiminary  work to be  done in passing  the necessary legislation,m submitting the marketing schemes and in guiding them throughthe stages of Section 1 of the Agricultural Marketing Act, and, mostimportant of all,  in making tho arrangements for the initial contractperiod  and in securing the  active support of all producers.   We  have considered how much time would be occupied in thispreliminary work, and  believe  that July  1st  next would  be theearliest date  by which it could,  with  reasonable  assurance, beexpected to be  completed,  and we do not think that this time-table could bo kept imless  some further  provisional measures were taken to expedite the original contract arrangements.  We therefore suggest that  immediately  pig  producers and  bacon curers havesignified  their approval of our proposals  in  general, though notnecessarily in detail, by the formal submission of marketing schemes,the Government  should appoint a provisional Pig Industry Dcvelop-ment Board, consisting of  three nominees of the National Farmers&apos;Unions of the United Kingdom, two nominees of tho Bacon Sectionof  the Food Manufacturers&apos;  Federation and one  of the  UlsterCurers&apos;  Association,   and  three  independent  members.    Theimmediate  task  before this body would  be  (a)  to conduct pro-pnganda in favour of  the  scheme and to get farmers &quot; contract-minded,&quot; and (b) to  negotiate inter se  provisional details  of the .basic formula which  shall operate until  December  31st,  1933,and also the contract terms and prices for the initial short-term con-tract period i.e., July to December, 1933. Once this provisional pig industry Development Board had  agreed upon contract  terms and prices,  feeders and curers could  start making contracts forbacon  pigs to be delivered from  July  1st onwards.  These con-tracts  would have to be conditional upon (a) the endorsement ofthe  two schemes at  the initial polls held in  accordance with theAgricultural  Marketing Act and (6) the  application  of  a  quota system on  or before  July 1st, 1933.  This Board would need  tobe financed by a loan from  public funds  under  the agricultural marketing  Act,  duly  amended for the purpose, and under any
corresponding legislation in Northern Ireland,  the loan being suh-scquently recoverable from tho Pigs and Bacon Boards concerned.   It is not unlikely that our proposals -vv ill be criticized as delayingunnecessarily the regulation of imports, but we would impress uponthe more impatient clitics that the adoption of our proposals will affect the breeding programmes of, and necessitate organization by,not only the  United Kingdom but every country which exportsbacon  here,  and  that  the  quota system  will probably involvenegotiation  with the exporting countries and will certainly involvetho construction of machinery  with which to administer it.   We would add that if this suggested time-table and programme should be adopted, the immediate practical effect will be that  pigsborn towards  the end of the year 1932 will be available for theexecution of contracts as from the  beginning  of the initial  short-term contract period on  July 1st, 1933.PART VI. GENERAL EFFICIENCY RECOMMENDATIONS :  PIG               PRODUCTION AND MARKETING.   34.  Standardization of Quality and  Type. Only two-fifths ofthe pigs killed for  bacon at factories  in this country are reputedto be suitable for the production of first-quality bacon.   although we admit that a misconception  of the  requirements of the porkmarket may be partially responsible for this state of affairs,  wethink that three of the present weaknesses of the pig industry inthis country   which  were referred to  in  paragraph 0 namely.superfluity of breeds and  types, lack of defined  carcase grades andthe absence  of payment for quality are still more responsible.These three weaknesses are all closely interlinked,  for the establish-ment of well-known carcase grades coupled with  cash discrimination against bad quality woidd soon react on the type and breed of pigsent to bacon factories,  and this, in  fact, is what we  anticipatewill happen.   One  of the  first actions of the Pig Industry Develop-ment Board should be to  prescribe both  carcase grades and qualityprice-differentials for contract bacon pigs.   We suggest that car-case weighing and grading should be done under the supervision of an official appointed by the Pig Industry Development Board in whose impartiality both curers and farmers Mould have faith.    The results of indifferent carcase quality would soon be reflected in the farmer&apos;s receipts, but, for rapid progress  in quality improve-ment, we  would recommend that  carcase grading  and weighingshould be  closely linked with pig-recording and litter-testing  (see below).  By analysis and broadcasting of the accumulated gradingresults, the  individual farmer&apos;s experience,  which  is necessarilylimited, will be corroborated by the investigation and publication
^ of the effects on quality of different types and methods of breeding, feeding and management.    As regards the type  and breed of pig to be recommended, wo quote and, in view of their wide experience, support the recommendations  - tion of the Pig Industry Council in its lleport, as follows :         &quot;The Council has expressed tho opinion that the continued use of     the Large White Boar would improve the standard of commercial stock.     It is therefore recommended that ovory encouragement should be given     to the u-;e of tho Largo White Boar as a premium boar and that, in addition     to the Large White Boar, premiums4  should be given only  to tho boars     of tho  Berkshire, Large Black. Middle White, Welsh and Essex and/or     Wessex breeds, those being the breeds recommended  by the trade as     providing suitable sows  for crossing with tho Largo White Boar.&quot;    To this list,  on expert advice, we would add the Long White Loji-carcd breed.    The eradication of scrub boars should not only help to standardize the pig population and thus improve potential  quality,  but should also improve the general rate of maturity  and ability  to convert feed  into  pig-meat.   We support  the  Pig Industry  Council in recommending legislation similar to the Improvement of Livestock (Licensing of Bulls) Act,  1931.    35.  Disease. Loss by disease, referred to on  page 11 as one of the weaknesses of the industry, is also serious.   The report of the Pig   Industry  Council  on  Veterinary  Researchf  stated,  inter alia,  that:         &quot; Tho Pig Industry Council is satisfied that the progress and develop-     ment of the pig industry in this country is retarded to an appreciable     extent  by reason of the very considerable losses that are either directly     or indirectly associated  with disease. Serious dislocation of markets is     often caused by a glut of immature pigs sent in and slaughtered because     of local outbreaks of various pig diseases.  .  . .&quot;        &quot; Diseases which are causing the most serious losses at the present     time are swine fever, swine erysipelas and certain diseases of the unweaned     pig.  It is our opinion  that special attention should be given to these     with the object of ascertaining improved methods of prevention, diagnosis     and  treatment. .  . .&quot;     The  Pig  Industry  CounciTs  recommendations  on  Veterinary Eesearch were summarized as follows :         1.  The establishment of a central station  where  continuous  and     intensive research regarding  the diagnosis, prevention and  treatment     of pig diseases may bo carried out.        2. The introduction of some system whereby the veterinary profession     and the pig industry may bo made acquainted from time to time with     the progress of research.        3.  The control of sera and vaccines with the object of maintaining     their standard of  potency for the  treatment or prevention  of the     diseases for which they wore devised.     Subject to due regard being given to such other recommendations as may  be made by the Agricultural Research Council, who have    * Under the Improvement of Livestock Scheme of tho Ministry of Agri- culture and Fisheries.    t Journal of the Ministry of Agriculture. Soptombor, 1931.
 tho matter of research into animal diseases under immediate con- sideration,  we concur with these proposals of  the Pig Industry Council.   Whilst we do not feel that the pig industry and, in particular, the bacon section  thereof, should be required to  bear the cost oi:&apos; this programme  of work for research  and services on these lines would also indirectly benefit other sections of the livestock industry and  also medicine we suggest that  a  portion  of the levy  of the Pigs Marketing Board should be earmarked for veterinary purposes. We would  point out that the Pigs Marketing Board, in its role as underwriter  of  involuntary  contract defaults by individual feeders,  will be  directly interested in  the reduction of losses by disease to a minimum.   36.   Improved Management. In the list of present weaknesses of the industry given in jmragraph 6, the lack of efficiency measures (of the  types provided by j3ig-recording and litter-testing) and the  undue prevalence  of inadequate  technique  in feeding and management were mentioned.   In this connexion, the Pig Industry Council  stated :*        &quot; Lack of success in pig-keeping, in so far as it may be duo to factors    within the producers&apos; control, may be attributable to mismanagement    by the breeder or feeder, unsuitable stock or unsuitable conditions under    which he operates.  Recording and litter-testing would supply a means    of measuring the efficiency of the individual breeder or feeder or of    his stock. . . .       &quot;The deputation, of tho Council which recently visited the Continent    found there a  more widespread knowledge of tho technique of feeding    and management than there is  in this country. This should not be&apos;difficult    to remedy. Proper housing, warmth and skilled management obviously    have an important bearing on production costs, and it appears possible    that is these matters we have not kept abreast of the times.&quot;   The results of the East Anglian Pig Recording Scheme confirmthis  view.  We  are  convinced  that  a  strenuous  campaign for improvement  in feeding  and  general  management is absolutely essential.  Not only do we urge this in  order that more and betterpigs  may be obtained from each sow, and in order that pigs maybe brought to  marketable weights with  greater rapidity and lessfood consumption, but also because we believe that, for the pro-duction  of good-quality pigs,  sound  feeding  and  managementare no less important than the use of good breeding stock.   We areaM&apos;are of the existence, in the constituent parts of the UnitedKingdom, of various services, both educational and administrative,to promote better  management;  in  expressing  the  view  thatorganized producers  should play an active part in providing and financing services of a similar kind, we assume that they will make thefullest use of such services as exist  and that they will continueto work in co-operation with and under the guidance of the appro-priate agricultural authorities.   * Marketing Leaflet No. 10, pages 5-6.
   (a) Pig Recording. No one now doubts the cash benefits thatthe farming community has obtained from milk-recording and egg-jaying tests.  Pig-recording has been shown both in East Angliaand in Wiltshire to be both practicable and valuable.  Pig-recordingon the lines suggested  in paragraphs 23 to 27 of the Pig  IndustryCouncil&apos;s Report on Litter Testing and Pig  Recording* should,in our opinion,  be an integral part of the efficiency campaign,and should be supported both by the Pigs and the Bacon marketing boards.   We feel, in addition, that a service of this value should not be restricted to  suppliers  of  contract bacon pigs,  and accordingly wehave made provision in our Pigs Marketing Scheme for this service to be performed by the Pigs Marketing Board for any producer,whether  registered under  the scheme or not or whether producingbacon or pork pigs, and for the Board to make special charges forsuch services on all who use them.   Pig-recording is  a  service of value to, and requiring the  co-operation of,  curers as well as farmers, and the Pigs Marketing board might well delegate its function in connexion therewith to the  pig industry Development Board.   (b) Litter Testing. We agree with the  Pig Industry  council that litte --testing lacks the urgency  of pig-recording and is  themore costly service.  It is true that litter-testing by itself measures the value of breeding stock and, if combined with pig-recording,enables the farmer to  find out how much of his success or failureas a pig keeper is attributable to breeding,  and how much to feedingand management.  Litter-testing, therefore, is likely to be of more immediate value to the pedigree breeder than to the general farmer.If the farmer could  purchase  &quot; tested &quot; stock or stock derivedtherefrom, pig-recording  on the farm would show  him that, if hefailed to reach the  standards previously  attained  at litter-testingstations by the stock  in  question, it was  due to his faulty feedingand management.   Pedigree pig breeders should,  in our opinion,take steps to create a supply of stock &quot; tested &quot;  in this way if only as their  contribution to the  benefits which  we believe willaccrue to them as a result of the adoption of our proposals.    37.   The Store  Pig  Trade. Approximately two-fifths  of the 3-J- million live pigs which, on the average, pass through the livestock markets of England  and Wales are recorded as  &quot; stores &quot; i.e. pigs which require further feeding before slaughter.  In addition, large numbers of store pigs change hands privately.  The trade is, therefore, of considerable magnitude.    We  have referred above (see paragraph 6) to what  is termed, in the  Ministry&apos;s Report  on the Marketing of Pigs in England and  Wales,^ &quot;the gamble of the store market.&quot; In the report in question,    * Marketing Leaflet No. 30.    f Economic Scries No. 12.
the gamble referred to was that of prices.  A feeder buys store pigs&apos;without any knowledge of the future prices of feed or of fat pigs.He may find when he markets the pigs he has fed that he boughthis stores too  dearlys or, on the other hand,  that&apos;he has made asubstantial profit.  But there  are,  in  addition, other gamblesin the store trade e.g. the purchasing feeder is uncertain of theage, weight, quality and economic capacity of the stores he buys.and cannot tell whether the pigs he  intends to feed come fromdisease-infected farms  or  have been  in contact with infectedanimals or premises  at markets.  In  addition, there is,  in the marketing of  stores, as the Pig Industry Council points out, &quot; incertain cases,  a considerable waste, as pigs change hands  in thestore period a good deal more  than is desirable.&quot;  These  movc-ments, and the prolonged transport and mishandling sometimesassociated with them,  often engender a  loss  of condition and oftime in feeding which is difficult to recover.    We agree  with  the Ministry* in wishing to see pig-breedingand pig-feeding concentrated on the same  farms, and in desiringa reduction in the volume of the store trade.   We realize, however,that, under conditions ruling in Great Britain, some trade in storepigs is more or less essential.    The store pig feeder will not, therefore, be denied participation in  our contract  proposals  (see paragraph  31),  but,  in order toprotect him further and to effect marketing  economies, we hopethat the  Pigs  Marketing Board will  take  steps  to  organize  the direct  farm-to-farm sale of store pigs from  pig-recorded  farms.Such a scheme, in reducing the uncertainties of the store pig feeder,would be  of considerable value and, if operated in connexion withthe pig-recording services, should be easy and cheap to administer.    3S.  Regularity  of  Production. We  have  spoken  elsewhereof  the cyclical nature  of pig and pig-meat supplies  and  its evileffects (see paragraphs S and  32), and have indicated how  ourbacon-quota proposals will tend to mitigate the extent of thesecycles, both at home  and abroad.  We do not pretend that  ourscheme will at  one  stroke stabilize pig production or,  indeed.home  bacon output.  We  appreciate  that,  under  our proposedsystem of contracts, the barrier segregating  the  pork and baconmarkets will periodically be removed and thus permit some change-over from one to the other, and, being voluntary7, will not guaranteecomplete long-period stability, particularly in view of our decisionto leave the pork market unregulated.  We feel, however, that ourquota and contract recommendations, if adopted, will go  a longway towards  ensuring long-period  regularity  of pig  productionand pave  the way for a scheme which ultimately might completelystabilize  home pig production.  In the  meantime,  much will   * Tlie Marketing of Pigs in England and Wales (Economic Series No. 12),page 21.
 pend on the ability of the Pigs Marketing Board to influence theproduction policies  of all producers, and  in this we  believe theioard would be greatly helped if it established a reliable service of [market  intelligence through  which  it   could  be  kept  well-informed as  to the current  and potential situation  in pigs, pigproducts and feeding-stuffs.   :S9.   Pig  Marketing Organizations:   Assembly,  Transport and delivery of Bacon Pigs. In the list of weaknesses of the industrygiven on page  11, we mentioned the fact that  many pigs do notirrive at the bacon factories by the most direct route or economicalmethods.   On this subject,  the Pig Industry Gouncil*  found that :        &quot; The bacon  factory, the wholesale pork market and the retail   pork shop are the destinations of live pigs, but it is doubtful whether   they arrive there, generally, either by the most direct or by the most   economical route.  There is an enormous annual charge on the industry,   which is non-essential  to tho true cost of production, in  tho form of   expenses incurred in auction markets and of profits, commissions or   salaries payable to dealers, or agents or employees of bacon factories.&quot;   Under  the  proposed  contract  S3rstem,   bacon pigs  will,  of course, normally be shipped by the most direct route  from farmto  factory.  If the  national  price were  to be for bacon pigs &quot; atfactory,&quot; which we do not  recommend, the farmer would tend,as  he paid carriage, to make contracts with the nearest factorythat was prepared to accept his pigs.  Thus, although there would lie  a  certain amount of overlapping, each  factory wotdd as  tosome extent factories do at present tend to have a zone of supply.On the  other hand, if,  as we recommend,  the  national  price is&quot; ex farm &quot; and the curer pays  carriage, each factory will wish todraw its supplies from a limited  area.   For the sake of factory efficiency and of economy in the assembly and carriage of pigs, we suggest that each contract might stipulateon  which day  of the week pigs  are  to be dispatched from certain areas.  For  instance,  farmers producing in, and  curers  drawingfrom, say, the Stowmarket area would  be allowed to dispatch orcollect  on any Tuesday in the month of delivery.  It  should notiie  difficult to organize collective assembly  for transport  throughthe medium of the railway companies, co-operative pig-dispatchingsocieties or  of other agencies, such as  auctioneers.  It would bepossible for the organization to be administered  by the Pigs Market-retraining Board or by curers operating separately or jointly, but we inclineto  the  former  alternative.  We realize that, in a few cases, largefeeders will be  dispatching lots of pigs big enough to make economicwagon  or lorry loads, but we would strongly suggest that organizedshipments to bacon factories (except from  farmers within  a fewmiles  thereof) should  be encouraged,  in spite of the difficulties* Marketing Leaflet No. 16.
which are anticipated in the identification of, and of fighting among-1 ;mixed consignments of pigs.   At the same time, the  industry should not  lose sight  of thepossible advantages of a more complete rationalization  of  bacon-pig transport, and, from preliminary investigations we have made.we have reason to believe  that  the railway  companies would  he prepared to discuss with the Bacon Board a scheme for equalizingon a zone basis all charges for the transport, whether by road  orrail, of contract pigs.  We trust that a scheme of this type  will  he brought to fruition, for, whilst it would still leave factories  free toobtain their supplies where  they  could, it would tend to encourage a  purer to restrict his  purchases to the particular transport zone inwhich his factory  was located, and  thus reduce the overlappingof supply areas that is inherent in the adoption  of a national &quot; exfarm &quot; price.  PART VII. GENERAL EFFICIENCY RECOMMENDATIONS :                       BACON CURING.   40.  Introductory. Up to this point,  we have been concernedwith weaknesses in the production and marketing of bacon pigs-the raw material of the curing industry.   But the latter industry itself, as at present established in this country, has certain con-spicuous weaknesses of its own, to some of which reference has beenmade in paragraph 6.   The costs of operating the bacon factories,as a whole, are unduly7 high, owing to the irregularity of supplies.to the excess of capacity over supplies in most factories, and to tiieexcessive  number and small average size of factories.  Further.the geographical distribution of factories is not as good as it mightbe.  The  technical practice  of factories, in particular  as regardsthe type  of cure  employed  and the disposal of offals,  is in  some respects open to adverse criticism.  Finally, improvements mightbe made in the marketing of bacon.   The efficiency of  the  curing  industry  concerns  not only thecurers themselves.  Faults in the siting, planning, operating andtechnique of factories may mean lower  returns to pig feeders aswell  as  to factories,  while  consumers also may suffer  throughunnecessarily high  bacon prices.  We  do not feel  justified in assuming  that with the expansion  of the bacon industry  theseweaknesses will automatically disappear.   We believe, rather, thatdeliberate measures to remedy  them, and  also progressively tointroduce any new improvements that may be desirable, should he made a condition of the granting of an increasing quota to the homebacon industry.   In  the following paragraph, we have set  forthbriefly the problems  involved, the reforms that we believe  to benecessary,  and the machinery whereby  these reforms might bebrought about.
  41.  Sources of Waste in Factory Operation. (a) Irregularity ofSupplies. Daily,  weekly,  seasonal  and  long-period  fluctuations in  supplies of bacon  pigs to individual factories arc at present aserious source of waste.   In order to be able to handle occasionalheavy&apos; supplies of pigs, it is necessary to invest more capital in plant,vehicles and buildings, and to maintain a larger labour force,  thanarc needed to deal with average supjilies.  Further,  it is  difficult10  maintain regular outlets for bacon, ham  and offals under theseconditions.   The causes of the  fluctuations are principally :        (i) the pig cycle, which governs the total supply of pigs ;       (ii) the  competition of the pork and bacon  markets for    supplies  of  pigs.   This is  dependent largely on  seasonal  and    short-time variations in the demand for pork ; the price that    can be offered by bacon factories is strictly limited by current    prices of bacon and by manufacturing  costs ;  and       (iii) competition between curers, causing short-period (3-7    days) variations  in prices  and  influencing the  allocation of    supplies  between factories.   The present irregularity of supplies is clearly illustrated by thefollowing Table, which gives the variations in  arrivals of pigs ata typical English factory (i) from year to year,  (ii)  from month tomonth, and (iii)  from week to week : . 1 rrrage Weekly Supplyof Bacon Pigs in the    Years 1023-9.    1923  ...

should at least be able to anticipate variations with some accuracy!and should thus be able to make arrangements to meet them.    (b) The Excess of Factory Capacity relative to Supplies of Pigs.- -Evidence from several sources  indicates  that English  factoriesoperate, on the average,  at a little more than half their capacity.Wc have seen no similar evidence for Scotland,  but it appears thatthe Northern Irish factories, like the English, operate, on the averajre.at about half capacity.   It is obvious that this excess of factory capacity relative to suppliesof pigs is very wasteful.   The following figures, which were supplied to us by a large English  factory, compare actual feeding costs perhundredweight  of  bacon with estimated costs  on the assumption of larger throughputs, and suggest that very important savings could be made  by utilizing factory capacity more fully : Cost per cwt. ofgreen bacon withaverage  kill  ofGS4 per  loceh.(Year    ended  Apr.,  1932)    s. d.     9  2Cost  per  cwl. ofgreen bacon withaverage   kill of002  per  week.(Year ended Oct.,     102S)     s.  d.     7  9JEstimated cost percwt. of green baconassuming averagekill of 2,000 per     week.   s.  d.   5  9fEstimated cost percwt. of green boonassuming averagikill of 2,500  ptr     week.     s. d.     5   1   The under-utilization of factory capacity is due partly to tin-excessive number of factories in relation to the total  supplies of pigs and partly to the irregularity and uncertainty of those supplies.which has deterred the British curers from attempting to expandtheir sales.  We hoi)e  that throughput will steadily approximatemore and more closely to capacity as the contract system develops.concurrently with an expansion of the home quota.  But if, as werecommend below, the increased output is to consist chiefly of tank-cured bacon, the actual capacity of existing factories will be greatlyincreased.   We have been informed  that the adoption of the wet-tank cure system by English factories would  enable the presentcuring facilities to deal with double the quantities.   In other words.if the capacity at present idle i.e. half the  total is utilized whollyfor tank-cured bacon, the  present output can be not  only doubledbut  trebled.  In addition  to the present factory output in GreatBritain of rather more than 1J million cwt. of bacon and hams-mainly in the form of dry-cure Wiltshire-side or  Midland cuts- -another 2 J- million cwt. or more of wet  tank-cured  bacon could beproduced, making an annual total of nearly 4 million cwt.  Further.in most factories, capacity  is limited not by the killing and dressingfacilities,  but  by the  available  chilling and curing space.  Thisis fairly  cheap and  easy to extend,  and we have little doubt that existing factories, with some structural  alterations, could be fittedfor producing half the total requirements of the United Kingdom.   Existing factories in the United  Kingdom, if properly  utilized,have, therefore,  a  capacity enormously in excess of their present
 aitput and of their probable output for some years to come.   In he interests of efficiency, it will be desirable to concentrate produc- lion as far as possible. We  therefore recommend that the Quota Advisory Committee should insist that the  curing industry should rationalize the utilization of its factory capacity.  The Pig Industry Development  Board should be the  instrument for preparing and supervising the plan of rationalization. The sanction of this body should be required for all new construction or for extensions of existing factories, subject to appeal to the Committee of Investiga- tion set up  under the  Agricultural Marketing Act.  In examining proposals for new factory  capacity,  the licensing authority would have to estimate carefully  the factors of size, design, location and prospect  of efficiency.  We think that consideration should be given to curers who, in the interests of both pig producers and the bacon industry  at home, are prepared to transfer factory accommodation from foreign countries to the United Kingdom and especially to those who are also in a position to sell  the bacon they produce  direct to the consumer.  We feel it  deserving of consideration whether the l&apos;ig Industry Development Board  should not be empowered to raise iands with  which  to  buy out  surplus factory units  at a price determined either by statutory arbitration or by agreement.   (c) Small Average Size of Factories. Available statistics covering 09 factories in England and Wales, 22 in  Scotland  and  118 in Northern  Ireland suggest that  the average  weekly throughput per factory is  350-400  carcases in the case of England and Wales, 40-50 in  the case of Scotland, and 50-00 in the case of  Northern 1 reland.  By contrast, the average weekly throughput of the Danish factories  appears to  be about 2,000  carcases.  It is probable that the average costs of production in the United Kingdom are unneces- sarily high, owing in part to the small average size of factories.  It has been stated in  evidence that  under  English conditions  the minimum economic capacity is 500 pigs per week ; yet half the bacon factories  of England and Wales, representing one-fifth of the total capacity, have an average weekly capacity of less than 500.   We recommend, therefore, that, in connexion with the  rationalisation - zation  policy  referred  to above, the licensing  authority  should carefully  examine the  question of the minimum economic size of factory, and should  aim at the expansion to an economic size or the elimination  of the small factories, so  far as either  policy is eonsistent with the interests of feeders and of the industry as a whole.   42. Geographical Distribution of Factories. The  Commission has not  considered in detail the question of the most  desirabledistribution of factories,  to which  reports of the Pig  Industry(&apos;council and the  Imperial Economic  Committee  have  referred. It  appears, however, that, at present, Wiltshire-side factories arefather  too  heavily  concentrated  in  the West of England.  with he expansion  of the industry, it will  become increasingly important
to have  factories well situated in respect of the supply of pigs;transport facilities, the  disposal of offals,  etc.  Good siting willbe especially important if large factory units are to replace smalleiunits.  We therefore recommend that, in preparing its programmeof factory rationalization, as suggested above, the Pig industry development Board should seek to determine the best distributionof factories in the interests of the bacon industry as a whole, andmight oven consider the purchase and shutting-down of badly sitec&apos;factories, while encouraging any desirable new construction, or exten-sion of old factories, on suitable sites.  In case private capital shoulinot be forthcoming for  all such construction, it is desirable  thatthe Pig  Industry Development Board should have powers itsellto undertake and to finance factory construction, on public utilitjlines or  otherwise, where it  is necessary in the  interests  of tlxindustry.    43.   Technical Practice. (a)  Bacon  and  Ham  Production-It is not within the scope of  the Commission to go into details othe curing technique employed in the United Kingdom.   home produced bacon at its best need not fear comparison with any otheibut the quality is by no means as-uniform as that of much importeibacon.   A comprehensive system of grading, operated  by  tinBacon Board, together with the use of the National Mark, will dmuch to produce the uniformly high standard that is so desirableThe Quota Advisory  Committee should  insist on the maintenancof  adequate standards  and on  adherence  to the  National Marlprogramme  of standardization as a  condition of increasing thehome quota.  In addition, we suggest below that, in certain casescontrol of technical methods may also be necessary.    The most immediate  problem, however, is to ensure that the types of bacon produced shall satisfy public demand. This,  webelieve,  will entail important changes in methods  of  production.The home quota is to be expanded at the expense of imports, whichconsist  chiefly of  tank-cured bacon.  On  the average, retained imports  of tank-cured bacon* during 1926-30 amounted to about million hundredweight, as compared with the total importation ofbacon*  of about 8 million hundredweight,  and  a  total  UnitedKingdom supply  of  bacon*  of about 9-J- million  hundredweight.It has been  repeatedly stated to us in evidence that the taste fortank-cured  bacon has become firmly established with very  large sections  of the public.  - If this is so and we believe the evidence we have heard upon  this point it is imperative that the increasein home production under the quota system shall consist chieflyof bacon cured by the tank process.  Tank-cured and  dry-cured  bacon can be produced economicallyii the same  factory, whilst the conversion of factory capacity fromdry cure to tank cure is a comparatively simple matter.* Excluding hams.
   It is possible, as has been claimed in evidence, that the market for dry-cured  bacon could be considerably extended if the baconcould be sold at prices competitive with those of tank-cured bacon.But, in our view, the success of the scheme would be imperilled ifretailers and consumers  were asked at  the  start to accept largequantities of dry-cured bacon, with which the majority of them are quite unfamiliar, in place of the familiar mild tank-cured product.   We recommend that the Bacon Board should make use of thepowers  it  Mill enjoy under  the Agricultural Marketing Act toregulate the  quantity of any  kind or variety of bacon  sold by&quot; curers,&quot; in order to ensure an adequate supply of tank-cured bacon,and that the Pig Industry Development Board should have regardto this aspect in licensing the construction of new or extension of old factories.   Tank-cured bacon has so  far  been produced in very small quantities in this  country, and any differentiation  there  may bobetween brands is still of negligible importance.  In the case ofdry-cured bacon, however, individual firms attach great importance(o the goodwill won for their particular brands by the characteristicflavour imparted by special methods of curing.   It M&apos;ould, there-fore,  be difficult,  and jierhaps  undesirable,  to impose  uniformity of technical  methods in  the dry-cure process.   But,  if  uniformmethods of tank curing are adopted at the outset of the neMr pro-gramme of expansion, it Mill be possible to ensure the same uniformity in the future output of British tank-cured bacon as is already foundin the Danish product;  nor can it  be objected that insistence onsuch  uniformity  is  unjust to  existing  interests.  We therefore recommend that  the  Pig Industry Development Board, in collabo-ratioii Mith the Bacon Board,  should conduct  a  thorough  andspeedy  enquiry into  the  technique  of the tank  eme, and on thebasis of this should lay down lines of curing practice which factoriesMrould be obliged  to  follow,  under  penalty  of prohibition on the sales  of their bacon tinder the powers of the Agricultural MarketingAct.   (6) Offal Utilization. Hitherto, United Kingdom factories have obtained,  on  the average, considerably larger returns from  theiroffals than have the Danish factories ;  it is partly as a result of this that  United  Kingdom  feeders  have frequently received higher prices for their pigs than the Danes, in spite of higher factory costs in this  country.  The higher prices of offals are no doubt partly due to the large markets available in the United Kingdom for the limited quantity of offals produced,  partly to more &quot;efficient organi-zation for their utilization at least in the  larger factories andpartly to the premium obtained by fresh, home-produced over frozen,imported edible offal.  As the available supplies of offals increaseMith  the development of home  bacon production, there will be atendency  for their value to  fall, although we have been assured that  demand is capable of considerable expansion, particularly in
certain areas of this country.   It will, nevertheless, become moreand more important that offals should be marketed  and utilizedin the most efficient way.    (c) Research. Both the production of bacon and hams and t!,vutilization of offals provide wide fields for research work.  We believe-that it is in the interests of the  bacon industry as a whole thaiinformation on technical improvements  or discoveries should b(made  freely available  to all factories.  As conservatism  in  thisrespect may persist among individual concerns especially, perhapsamong those which have  already developed  research  branchesof their own we recommend that the Pig Industry development board should operate a central research station.   This would collecttechnical information at home and abroad, investigate the problemsof individual factories on payment of a reasonable fee, and conductlong-range research.  All its information  should be  freely at tindisposal of registered producers of bacon.    44.  Marketing. The  consolidation of  the curing  industry inthe Bacon Board,  and its co-operation with the feeding industnin the Pig Industry Development Board, make it possible for vainable work to  be undertaken in connexion with the  marketing obacon.   We suggest that the Pig Industry Development  Boarior the Bacon Board should operate a market information servicegiving details of foreign killings and arrivals of imports, the extento which  quotas  are being filled, prices of rival  commodities, etc.as well as of current prices in the chief markets  for various gradeand varieties  of imported and home-produced  bacon and  hamsUseful marketing research could be done, for example, on consumerstastes in different areas, possible export markets, and on the coinsof prices under the quota system ;  this would probably fall withinthe province of the Pig Industry Development  Board.    We have not  explored the possibilities of  centralized sellingbut believe that it may prove an innovation useful to certain smallerfactories which have no wholesale outlets or desire to participate in large contracts, as, for example, for the supply of bacon to HJIForces.    We have referred above to the need for standardization as aiinstrument to secure uniformity of quality at a high level.  It willbe  one of the chief functions of the  Bacon Marketing  Board tprescribe  and enforce the use of such  standards.    Finally,  the advertising  of home-produced  bacon should bundertaken by the Bacon Board or the Pig Industry  DevelopmenBoard on an  extensive scale,  as  in the early years of the quotsystem it will be necessary to break  down fairly strongly fixedtastes for foreign products ;  in this campaign,  the National Markand the use of standardized grades should prove  valuable assetsAny costs incurred by  the Government Departments concerned inadministering a National Mark scheme  for bacon should be; defrayedby  the organized industry.
             PART Vm-NORTHERN IRELAND.   45.  We are required by our terms of reference to investigate,inter alia, the extent to which any scheme prepared by us underthe Agricultural Marketing Act &quot; could  be facilitated by co-opera-tion between the board  administering  it  and any  correspondingbody in Northern Ireland,&quot; and also &quot; to investigate the manner inwhich its operation could be facilitated by the quantitative regula-tion of imports. ...&quot;   We infer that we are therefore only concernedwith any action which may  or may not be taken by  NorthernIreland (a) in order to fulfil our terms of reference and (b) in ordert o make sure that any action taken in Northern Ireland will neitherprejudice the success of our scheme as a  whole nor react unfavour-ably on individual farmers or curers in Great Britain.   We have already indicated (see paragraph 10) that co-operationbetween pig and bacon producers in the United Kingdom as a wholecould best be maintained, in our opinion, through the Pig industry development Board, but we have also had to consider the way inwhich  our proposals would be affected by the parallel  proposalsfor Northern Ireland.  In this connexion, we have had the advantageof consultation with representatives of the Government of NorthernIreland, of the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union  and of the Ulster Curers&apos;Association.   We have been informed that, agriculturally, Northern Ireland *differs fundamentally from Great Britain in that it is essentially country of small peasant farmers.  Further, the local pork marketis almost negligible and, although some  quantities  of pigs and car-cases are sold on the pork market of Great Britain, the problem ofthe co-existence of the pork and bacon  markets has not arisen tothe same extent as in Great Britain.  Thus, while, on the one hand,the bulk of the farmers of Northern Ireland are apparently not ina position to enjoy the security and other advantages offered bythe contract system, there is, on the other hand, not the same urgent need to segregate the  pork and bacon  markets.   We realize that the contract system does not suit the prevailingcircumstances of the Northern Irish industry, but we understandthat, in the  future,  vigorous  steps are to  be  taken in  NorthernIreland to encourage the use of contracts.   There have been  shown to us alternative proposals which it isproposed to  apply to the  Northern Irish industry in the eventof the imposition  of a  quota system.  It is therein suggested thatthe Northern Ireland quota should be fixed by the Quota AdvisoryCommittee and based on an estimate of the anticipated supply ofbacon and hams made by the  Ministry of Agriculture for NorthernIreland.  In  advising  the  Quota Advisory Committee  as  to asuitable Northern Ireland quota for the  initial period, the Ministry* For statistics of the pig industry in Northern Ireland see paragraph 4.
of Agriculture  for  Northern Ireland would take into considora-tion :        (i) The number of pigs bought for curing in  a normal year    plus the number  of bacon pigs exported dead and alive to    Great Britain in a normal year ; and       (ii) the pig population as shown by the agricultural statistics    plus an allowance for store pigs imported from  the Irish Free    State.   Allowance would  be made for an expansion of production ata rate not exceeding 10 per cent, every four months, such increases to be subject to any conditions (apart from the contract requirement)governing similar increases in Great Britain.   We believe that these proposals, broadly, are an adequate comple-ment to our recommendations, provided that power is given to the quota  Advisory Committee to secure the same stability of supply as we think necessary in the case of Great Britain and other suppliersof the  United  Kingdom market.   On  this principle we  find  thatour views are shared by Northern Ireland.  We therefore suggestthat the Northern Ireland ciuota should be subject to a 5 per cent.annual tolerance and  a tolerance of i  10 per cent, on each  fort-nightly sub-quota period, and  that it should be readjusted duringthe course of the quota year if the quota output of bacon and hamsfalls below the lower limit of the sub-quota period tolerance for morethan three  consecutive fortnightly periods or  for  more than sixfortnightly  periods in six months.    We  understand, further, that  the proposals contemplate thatthe Northern  Ireland quota will  cover not  only bacon made  inNorthern Ireland but also pigs consigned, with quota certificates,to  curers in Great Britain.    We are informed that the Government of Northern Ireland will facilitate any  legislation  necessary to  implement the satisfactoryoperation of their proposals and will take steps to set up NorthernIreland Pigs and Bacon Marketing Boards.
23&apos;                PART LX. CONCLUSIONS.               Summary of Recommendations. 10.  General.    (i). Wc arc  satisfied that  recent  prices of pigs and pig ^SamA1 products have  been  dangerously low from the  producers&apos; *ompi\Vion point of view,  that these low  prices arc not to the ultimate iKept-varas.i&amp; benefit  of  the  consumer,  and that  the  orderly  expansion a:    m&quot; of the homo bacon industry cannot be achieved  unless the relatively high imports of bacon from established Continental industries arc regulated.    (ii).  Study of the effects  of the pig  price and feeding-stuffs        for price cycles leads us to the conclusion  :                     pricc^mi1&apos;&apos;^-         (a)  that the total  United Kingdom  bacon supplies cycics&quot;&quot;9 prlco     should be stabilized, in order to limit the effect of the pig- S/m/&apos;%,wl&apos;%2-     supply cycle, and                                       lty-         (b)  that, as far as  possible,  United Kingdom bacon-     pig prices should vary with feeding-stuffs prices.    (iii). Expansion of the home pig industry must take the form   !pcmb?6o1 of increased bacon  production, as the capacity  of the pork (Av^nil&quot;!!m?m9 market  is limited.  We therefore recommend that the pork- JJ? p&apos;&quot;J&quot; 10 ,l: pig  and  bacon-pig  markets should  be segregated as far as possible, and we make no  provision in our scheme for the regulation of the marketing  of pork pigs.    (iv). In order to  overcome  the difficulties  discussed in recommenda- paragraphs 6-9 of our Report, and to achieve the objectives (^&quot;homo0 ^ outlined in (i),  (ii) and  (iii) above, we recommend :         w&apos;5&quot;cmlorig            (a) that the volume of total bacon supplies should wn5c&quot;a&apos;rAi         be regulated by quotas both on home production  and l&apos;r&quot;Lsur r         On imports ;  and                                   \T*  $3             (b) that bacon pigs should be sold only on annual is-24).         contracts at a national price closely related to feeding         costs. In addition, we suggest certain measures designed to increase the general efficiency of pig and bacon production and market- ing, and to remedy some of the weaknesses of the pig and pig products industry as a whole.    (v). We consider the following bodies to be necessary for the Closed: successful operation of  our quota,  contract and efficiency * * ,&quot;ta,a&apos;a\t proposals :                                                271.        (a) A Quota Advisory Committee, similar in character comir,iucc!sory     to the existing  Import  Duties Advisory Committee, and     available for any future   subjects of  quota  regulation.     The duties of this  body would be quota determination and     allocation, and the guardianship  of the public interest.

This Board  should also be in               a position to undertake on behalf of the Pigs and Bacon               Marketing Boards efficiency and other  services in  which               they  are jointly7 interested.

(d) Section 15 (2) of the Agricultural Marketing Act.               1931, contemplates the continued existence of any  Re-               organization Commission set up thereunder.   We consider               that the orderly7 development of tho pig industry7, both in               the public interest and in the interest of those directly               concerned, woidd  be  facilitated by7 the  existence of  a               Permanent Reorganization Commission, independent and               non-political in membership.  The purview7 of this body               should not, however, be limited to pigs and pig products :               it should be a planning body for the agricultural industry as               a whole.           47.

We are convinced that the regulation  of  foreignprovisional   competition is now a matter of great urgency.  We therefore(^p.gepnro!3 33 urge the Government to expedite the passing of the additional   pages m-  iegisiati0n required before effect can be given to our proposals.          The industry itself should, we  think, need no prompting to          submit the essential marketing schemes at the earliest possible          moment.              We realize,  however, that there is  an immense amount          of preliminary work  to be  done, and we regret that, in con-          sequence, July 1st,  1933,  would  appear to be the  earliest          date by which our contract and quota proposals coidd come          into operation.   But, to avoid  delay, we recommend that as          soon as marketing schemes have been formally submitted by          the industry, the Government should appoint a provisional          Pig Industry Development Board, consisting of representatives          of producers and curers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland,          with an independent nucleus.   The  functions of  this  body,          besides  conducting propaganda among  farmers and curers          in favour of the scheme, would  be to arrange the details of an          initial  basic-price formula, and of  the  contract  terms and          prices for an initial  contract and quota period, starting on          July 1st, 1933, and lasting until December 31st in that year.           On the basis of these terms and prices, feeders  and cuxers           could start making contracts for bacon pigs  to be delivered           from July 1st onwards.  The first yearly contract and quota           period would then start on January 1st, 1934.           52. Concluding Observations. We have tried,  throughout,           to  take a  long  view.  In  our  recommendations,  we have           therefore aimed at a gradual but permanent building-up of a           home bacon industry and have avoided a policy that might           temporarily benefit  the farmer by causing a spectacular rise           in the profits of pig keeping with the risk of a corresponding           severe collapse after a short time.               We think, nevertheless, that the basic-price formula sug-           gested in paragraph 23 is reasonable and that, having regard           to current pig prices, it is sufficiently attractive to the farmer           to encourage the signing of contracts and so to secure, initially,           a substantial home quota.  We think it should be to the curers&apos;           ultimate advantage to give early encouragement to the suppliers           of their raw material and, in negotiating a price formula for           the six months contract period ending December 31st, 1933,           we suggest that the provisional  Pig Industry Development           Board should have this point in mind.
   It is difficult to estimate how far the curers will be affectedby the altered  circumstances of the trade.  But, with baconfactories better distributed  and  working  up to  their  full capacity, with  a  greater uniformity of carcase and stability of bacon prices, and with the more general adoption of the cheaper tank-cure process, the costs  to  the home industry should come down.   Bearing  in mind that time may be needed for  the betterorganization and improved efficiency to take effect,  we wishto emphasize the gradual nature of our proposals.  The curerwill still have his dry-cure bacon trade with its special price,and wo think that by the time he has developed the tank cure,where the keenest foreign competition will be felt, the efficient-encies should have had their effect in reducing the costs of theindustry and in producing a competitive  article.   One of the chief advantages at present attaching to thehome curer is  tho higher price obtainable  for his offals and subsidiary pig products, owing to the neighbouring demand ofan industrial population.  We  do  not suggest that a quotashould be imposed upon these products, because  wre believethat it would be complicated to administer.   If, however, itshould appear in the early stages of the reorganization of theindustry that these products were being imported to an extentlikely to  jeopardize  the  working  of  the  main  quota,  steps might need to be taken by the Government to protect thecurer in that respect.  We hope, however, that this contin-gency will not arise.   We believe that the recent level of bacon prices has beenunjustifiably low.  Subject, then, to a justifiable  rise in baconprices, we hope the  effect of our scheme, with the safeguardswe have suggested, will be to promote stability in a free market.If, however, steps should be taken by any7 section of the tradeto defeat this primary object of our proposals, it might  benecessaiy to invoke the alternative methods of control en-visaged in paragraph 12.   In some parts of our Report, we may seem to have suggestedin some detail the methods which we think should be employedby7 the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Boards ; these  expressions of our opinion are, however, only suggestions, for we recognizethat the future of the industry7 will be in the hands of producers,whether farmers or curers.  Agricultural marketing must  be founded upon the principles of self-discipline and self-deter-mination,  and with  these  principles our  recommendationsconform.  We consider that the Pig Industry  development board is the corner-stone of our plan.   It is right, but it is not sufficient, for pig producers and for bacon curers to be organ-ized in watertight compartments for the better control of their own affairs ; they have so  much in common on  which the   51S8                                                  ci
welfare  of the whole  pig industry requires  that they should speak   as one industry.  We  do not suggest that the pig industry Development Board should usurp any of the autonomyof the Pigs or Bacon Marketing Boards, or that pig producersshould control or be controlled by bacon curcrs ;  we suggestonly that considerations of  common policy  should be settled by a properly representative  body to which,  for reasons  of economy,  there might  also be entrusted  certain executiveservices for  the development of the industry as a  whole.   Inthis joint body is developed the idea of co-operation, in accord-ance with the spirit and intention of the Agricultural MarketingAct, between the various sections of the industry, upon which its success in the future must depend.    53. In  conclusion,  we  desire to  place on  record our appreciation of the manner in which our Secretary, Mr. J.  B.Baber, of the Markets Division of the Ministry of  Agricultureand Fisheries, has carried out his duties in connexion with out enquiry.  With his sound  judgment and wide knowledge  ofthe problems involved  in our terms of reference  and of the technique of  organization, he has proved a  most helpfulcounsellor and we are greatly indebted to him.   We desire to acknowledge our indebtedness also to ourAssistant Secretary, Mr. A. R. Manktelow, and to the othermembers of our staff seconded from the Markets  Division ofthe Ministry namely, Mr. C. H. Blagburn, Mr. A. N. Duckhaniand Mr. C. A. L. Irving.    As regards Scotland and Northern Ireland, our wrork hasbeen greatly facilitated by  the valuable assistance which  wehave received from Mr. H. Crow, of the  Scottish  Office, andMr. G. Scott Robertson, of the Department  of Agriculture  for northern Ireland, who were  appointed to act in liaison between their respective Departments and ourselves.

RESERVATION BY sir WILLIAM S. HALDANE.    I  have signed the  foregoing  Report under reservation  on a matter  of principle, which I  foresee involves serious practical consequence.    From  an early stage in our enquiries I realized that I differ from  my  colleagues  in  my views as to the need for adherence, in the jJroposals we should submit, to the main principles and purposes of the Marketing Act of last year, under which we were constituted ; and when it was decided,  for reasons good in themselves, to con- centrato our attention primarily on the bacon side of the industry, I pointed  out tho difficulty that might arise if we departed from the intention  of the  Act to deal comprehensively  and co-operatively with the marketing of the  &quot; agricultural product &quot; our instructions cover.    Though till the later stage of our deliberations we had in view that the marketing of pork-pigs should also be  regulated, possibly along with other  live stock, we have, I think, allowed the complex problems  which have arisen as to  tho regulation of  the  bacon side of the industry to distract us so much from the claims of its pork side that  the  final proposals in the Report almost  entirely ignore the needs of the latter, notwithstanding the wide  instruction we were given.   Could I have regarded the pork side in its  marketingas a matter of little consequence, or as  being satisfactory  in its present state, or even felt any certainty of its being dealt with soon in some satisfactory  manner, I should not have had much difficultyin concurring  with the  decisions finally reached by my  colleagues in this  respect, even if not completely fulfilling  our  statutoryduties.   The  pork side is estimated  to be over two-thirds of  the pig industry as a whole, and though the evidence we have taken  as toit has been limited,  the published reports before us, both english and Scottish, besides impressive representation as to its importance from Scotland, convince me that its marketing requires early and careful attention,  being far from satisfactory at present, as I believeis  common view.  Moreover, the proposals in the Report,  as isclearly stated, would involve increasing detriment to the pork-pigmarket by converting it into a &quot; surplus  &quot; market for the purposeof protecting the  bacon-pig market.   On legal advice  being  taken for  preparation,  finally, of thestatutory  Scheme on winch  our proposals must  be  based, nodefinition  of the bacon-pig has  been found differentiating it  fromthe pork-pig, to satisfy our advisers, and therefore, to conform withthe Statute,  the Scheme is drawn up to cover all pigs, even thoughthe actual marketing provisions are  confined to pigs  contractedfor bacon curing.   As I am advised, the effect of this  would be that,not only would we be doing nothing  to  help the industry in the marketing of pork-pigs  but that, so  long  as the Scheme  continued
n the form proposed and the Statute was not amended to suit, noother Scheme could deal with the marketing of such pigs.   It has been suggested that the Scheme being put forward nowcould be amended later on to cover the marketing of pork-pigs ;but this suggestion offers no practical remedy for reasons which Ithink are obvious on  study  of  the  difficult statutory procedurethat would be  required, and moreover would  be  dependent onsufficient support from the  contracting bacon-pig producers whoseintended representative Board woidd have absolute decision as towhether any such amendment might be proposed, even for any partof Great Britain.   I feel,  therefore, though with much regret, that, as matters are now, the difficulties involved are too  serious for my concurrence in the proposals of my colleagues, in so far as they stand in the wayof the  due regulation of the pork-pig  market at an early date.Greater effort  towards their  solution has not  been possible,  un-fortunately, owing to the urgency impressed on us  to issue  our report for reasons quite apart from the difficulties which have now arisen.   I  wish, however, to make clear that I am in full agreement withthe  conclusions reached to satisfy  the bacon  industry&apos;s needs,particularly as to the  essential necessity7 for methods of close and continuous co-operation between its constituent parts if it is hoped to meet home requirements in  competition  with imports fromabroad. I believe that in the peculiar position of the British bacontrade,  completely7 dominated as it is by unregulated imports ofvast quantity,  it is impossible to  regulate home production withoutregulation  of these imports, the extraordinary irregularity of ourpig-meat supplies being set out in paragraph S of the Report.   Although at first I felt difficulty in accepting proposals departingat all from the basal principle of the Act of last year placing the production-producer in full control of the  regulation of his marketing, I am con-vinced  as  to the  advisability7 of modifydng this  principle by theintroduction, through  the Pig Industry  Development Board and aPermanent Reorganization Commission,  of the wider principle of a proper  degree  of State guidance  and industrial control.

1IS   NOTES ON  PIGS AND BACON MARKETING  SCHEMES.                     1.   Definition of &quot;Curer.&quot;  All bacon, whether homo-produced  or  imported, that  passes  through    n^arka;tan2*.iholesale channels, is tho product of a factory industry, although the capacity Bacon^Farkct-i individual factories  may vary very considerably.                         i&quot;B Scheme,  On tho othor hand, it is known that pork is cured at times by a cortain para&apos; &quot; &apos;lumber of pork butchers, whose output is not only inconsiderable but may be  cribed as irregular and even occasional.  Such men sometimes  use curingisamethodof getting rid of asm-plus of pork left unsold on their hands, whilsthoy generally sell thoir output direct to tho consumer ovor their  own shop-hunters.  It would bo manifestly  difficult and, in our opinion,  unnecessary to applyhe contract system to tho output of this typo of producer while sales ofwrk pigs are uncontrolled, nor do wo think it necessary to  take note of theseapplies  for tho purposes  of  tho homo quota.  To  establish the prmciplohat bacon curing is a factoiy industry, wo have thoroforo introduced the st of whether machinory  driven by mechanical power is used, but we haveilso included a quantitative  dividing  lino which  will provent tho soriousxpansion of this butcher-curer trade, which might result in certain circumstances-tances and which we  should hold to be undesirable.  Tho effect of the definition will not bo to exclude from  the schomo  anymall bacon producer who  might wish to become registered.               2.  Constitution of Marketing  Boards.  Differont systems have been  suggested for electing tho Pigs and Bacon pins MarketingMarketing  Boards, respectively.                                           I^Tsm&apos;&quot;   In the case of the Pigs Marketing Board, we suggest  eight district  and Bacon Markct-liree special  members.  The eight districts were selected  on the  basis of ISSaa?1?,&quot;?!&apos; *heir  1932  pig population, which was  as  follows :52.District.1. South Western2. South  Eastern      Counties and areas          included. (&quot;Somersetshire J  Dorsetshire&apos; I  Devonshire   CornwallKentSurreyMiddlesex and London (in-  cluding the City)SussexBerkshire  ...Hampshire  (including  the  Isle of Wight)OxfordsliireBuckinghamshire  ...BedfordshireWiltshire   Pig population  according to theAgricultural Returns,       1932.480,500484,9003.

Cambridgeshire   (including   tho Isle of Ely) Cheshire Shropshire ...    ...... Staffordshire Warwickshire Worcestershire Gloucestershire Herefordshire(&quot;Cumberland Northumberland  ... Durham (tho whole County) Westmorland Lancashire ... Yorkshire  ...

In  the  case of the Bacon Board, the number of registered producers n\likely to bo small and therefore the need for district representation does notarise.  The problem in this case is to give adequate representation to factories Iof different size ; this our suggestion is intended to do.                             3.  Exemption of Pig Producers.ScheMarketing    This  paragraph deals with an  important point viz., what producers  iemc, para.  are ^Q ^ exempj. from registration.  The effect of the paragraph is that any            producer of pigs who does not desire to cater for the  demand  for pigs on            the part of the bacon factories need not, unless he wishes, have anything            to do with the scheme at all.  It is only producers who desire to deal with            bacon curers, either directly or (as subsequently provided in Part VI of the            Scheme) through the  medium of  tho Board, who will have any need to            register; but any producer  may become registered who wishes to  do so.            4.  Power of Bacon  Marketing  Board to Negotiate Contract Terms                           and Prices with Pigs Marketing Board.Scfieme&quot;^&quot;&quot;8        soverai occasions in our Report, we havo referred to the negotiation-  ieme, para.  qj oon i-act terms an(j prices between farmers and curers, and to the desk-            ability that theso negotiations should be conducted by the commodity boards
110X  X *Jii^fo aro advised, however, that it would not be possiblo under the Agricultural Marketing Act to empower a Bacon Marketing Board to rogulato in any way the purchase of pigs by its members.  Wo have therefore providod in para- ouph 38 of tho Pigs Marketing Schemo for tho negotiations to bo conducted ,in tho curors&apos; side by the members of tho Bacon Markoting Board acting in an individual capacity,  and in  tho Bacon Marketing Schemo wo have  been unable to make any roferenco to the negotiations.   This position is not  satisfactory, and wo recommend the amendment of the Act to enable  a Markoting Board regulating tho markoting of a manu- inetured article, to conduct negotiations, with regard to the purchase of tho iaw material, with any other marketing  board of which that raw material is tho regulated product.      5.   Participation of Pigs  Marketing  Board  in Contracts.   This paragraph embodies the central feature of tho Schemo.  It provides pjKS Marketing machinery for tho  supply of pigs by registered producers, through tho Pigs Scheme, para. Markoting Board, to curers, and it is on the  contracts made under it that the 8&apos; In.me quota for  bacon,  and the shares in this of individual curers, will be bused.   The procedure proposed is that the Board shall, after consulting represonta- lives of tho curers, from time to timo fix standard prices and a standard form (or standard forms) of contract which aro to bo employed in all cases whore a oiier wishes a purchase  of pigs  to count for  the purposes of tho bacon quota. The actual contract which tho curer enters into will  bo a contract, not  with in individual producer,  but with the Board ; but the Board need only enter into such a  contract if  the curer has already found a registered producer who is prepared to contract  with tho Board to supply the necessary pigs ; and if the curer does find such a producer, the Board will, subject to the (nullifications mentioned below, have  no right  to refuse to enter into tho contract.  The Scheme  thus definitely does  not involve the taking away from  individual producers of the right and duty to  find  curers who  will purchase their respective pigs.  It does,  however, put upon the Board the duty of securing to tho curers the supplies of pigs which they require to  fulfil their quota  obligations, and confers on the Board the corresponding power of enforcing against registered producers (if need be, by legal  process) tho fulfilment of their  contracts.   The substantial qualifications on the absoluto nature of the BoarcVs  duty to enter into contracts under this  paragraph are those contained in provisos id) and (6).  Proviso (a) empowers the Board  to limit their commitments over specific periods in  respect either of pigs generally, or any  particular kind of pigs.  Some such power is necessary to ensure that more contracts arc not entered into than  are  necessary to absorb the home quota or that deliveries under such contracts as are entered into are spread over the  year io the satisfaction of the  Quota  Advisory Committee.  Proviso  (6) is self- explanatory.    Proviso (c) deals with a different point.  It contemplates that, in certain classes of eases, at  any rate, the obligations undertaken by the  producer inwards  the Board may bo different from  those undertaken by the Board towards  the curer.  Tho terms  of the  proviso aro  elastic, but  we  have hud two main  points in mind. First, we  contemplate  the  possibility of a scheme by which  the  Board would, in effect, insure the producer against disease  or similar occurrences which  prevented him from delivering the contracted number of  pigs.   This would be done  by the insertion in his tontract of  an express provision that in the event in question he should bo freed from his obligations ; the Board would then have to supply the curer nth his pigs from  some other source.  Secondly, we consider that tho Board night wish to undertake additional functions, such as tho duty of  transport- ing the pigs from the farm  to the factory ;  this result could be attained
by making tho contract with tlio producer an &quot;ox farm&quot; conrtact, in ,tho  contract  with the  curer  a &quot;delivered at factory&quot; contract.  Thesetwo points aro, however, merely examples and  it is probable that there arcother respects in which tho Board  might with  advantage undertake themiddleman&apos;s risks and duties.  In cases where thoy do so,  it is, of course,proper that thoir additional functions should bo reflected in a margin betweentho price paid to tho producer and that received from tho curer, and the concluding words of tho proviso duly provide for  this.    It may bo obsorved, in conclusion,  that tho opening words of the pain-graph oxpressly &quot; save &quot; tho powcre  conferred  on tho  Board by tho earlierprovisions of tho Scheme e.g. the general powers conferred on tho Board to buy and sell pigs, etc.   Wo  contemplate that, at first, these genoral power-will only bo used in connexion with and in aid of tho functions of tho board under  this paragraph o.g. for tho cstablislunent of a &quot;surplus pool&quot; otpigs, which may be used by tho Board to make good  defaults by suppliersundor  contracts  entered into  under this paragraph but wo foresee tliepossibility that, in courso of time, tho Board may desiro to opcrato the mover a widor field, and wo think it proper that  thoy should be in a positionto do so.
