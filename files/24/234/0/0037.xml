(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 165-A.)  Note by the Chairman of the Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee.    THE Air Raids  Precautions  (Policy) Sub-Committee, in approving thisreport, wish to draw particular attention to the fact that, in their opinion, thequestion of age is an important factor when considering tbe appointment of theAir Raids Commandant.                                       (Signed)       JOHN GILMOUR.    2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,          October 21, 1932.     Report by the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee.    IT  will  be recalled  that  the  present  organisation of  the  Air  raids precautions Services  is based on two Committees one a Ministerial Committeeand the other a Departmental Committee and that the present  intention is thatthis organisation should continue to operate in  time of war.  The  form  of theorganisation,  as outlined  above,  was suggested in 1928 .in a Report to theCommittee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 162-A) and  was endorsed atthe 239th Meeting  of the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence,  Minute 8, andsubsequently received approval by the Cabinet (Cabinet 2 (29),  Conclusion  13).*    2.   Since  the form of organisation at  present existing was approved and brought into force a good deal  of experience has been gained  and the number and  range of the  general   problems has  been further explored,  with  theresult that the question of the general  organisation has inevitably at various times come  under  review.   It  was  originally thought, not  only   that  the ministerial and Departmental Committees  would be adequate  in time of war,but also the Chairman of the  Departmental Committee might assume the supremecontrol of Air Raids Services when the time arose.  It was always appreciated that, in time of war, the direction and administration of Air Raids Services might provide whole-time employment for those concerned, but it was hoped it mightbe possible to make  suitable arrangements  for the  services of the  personnelrequired to be made aA^available  in  accordance with the needs of the situation.    3.   The additional insight which the past four years&apos; work has given to thewhole problem has tended, however, to raise doubts as to the suitability of theexisting  organisation to assume  what must be a great number of  executive responsibilities in  time of war.   It would  appear that, as in  peace, the  right                          * See C.I.D. Paper No. 1G5-A.      [7707]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
employment for these Committees is to supply the main directive force and ensurethe necessary co-operation and co-ordination between all those concerned in air raids  Precautions activities;  and it has  come to be realised that to super-impose an executive function on top of the multifarious activities which already exist might have the effect of dislocating the machine.    4.  There is a further consideration of importance in this connection.  Thepurpose of the existing organisation has been stated above to be one of providing the directive force; that is to say, it  should be responsible for  laying down thegeneral principles on which the detailed schemes can be worked out and adapted to meet local conditions.   There has been  a not unnatural though undesirabletendency to involve this organisation  in a mass of detail with which it is hardlycompetent to deal,  detail, in fact, which can only be dealt with satisfactorily by theauthority or authorities who will be  responsible ultimately for the execution ofthe various  plans.  This accumulation of detail has tended to clog the machine and to slow down the work and, conceivably, to obscure the main issues.  Tosome extent, the great need for  secrecy has been  responsible for this state ofaffairs, but now that so much publicity is accorded to these matters abroad and owing to the fact that the  authorities  have agreed to relax to some extent therestrictions  imposed, it should be possible to divorce a great deal of this detailfrom  the work of the Committee and allocate it where it is most appropriate.    5.  These  reflections  have led to the opinion  that  it  will be necessary tocreate  some Central Administrative  Authority for the London area.   In areasoutside London, schemes for which will have to be  considered in due course, theexisting civil machinery should be capable of comparatively simple adaptation tothe requirements  of the situation.  County  organisations could probably be organised on a basis somewhat similar to that proposed  in the  last War to dealwith the population in case of invasion; that is to  say, a Committee could be setup under the Presidency or Chairmanship of the Lord-Lieutenant of the County.Large towns could be dealt with by means of  an organisation set up under the mayor Avith the  assistance of the Chief  Constable;  but, so far as London isconcerned,  no  ready-made  organisation  exists  Avhich is  comparable  to thosedescribed above.  It has been suggested that the Chairman of the London CountyCouncil might be a suitable person with Avhom  to inATest this responsibility, but alittle  investigation will show that his position is not in the least comparable tothat of a Lord-Lieutenant or a Mayor, and  that there are, in addition,  numerousinterests of vital  importance to  the  Air Raids  Services over AAdiich  he has no authority and which could not be put under his  authority without risk of graA^edislocation of existing organisation and, consequently, of efficiency in operation.    6.  This leads, therefore,  to the conclusion that it  Avill be better to set up some entirely neAv  and independent organisation to administer the special problem which London  presents,  and, after mature consideration,  it is thought that asuitable Head of  this organisation might be found in the Governor of ChelseaHospital or the Lieutenant of the ToAver.  Both these appointments, as is Avellknown, are held by Senior  Army  Officers. Neither  of  these  appointments isparticularly onerous in Peace time, and even in War it is not thought that therewould be any  insuperable difficulties in combining the  tAvo posts of  military governor and Air Raids Commandant for London.   It is conceivable that, in thelight  of  experience, it may  be found desirable to  appoint a special Air RaidsCommandant to organise and be executiA7ely responsible for the Provinces, and,although it is not proposed to submit any definite  recommendation on this point at present, it is desired to draw attention to this possibility.    7.  From Avhat has been said in previous paragraphs it  is clear that theappointment of an Air Raids Commandant for London should be made in Peacetime, and that the individual selected for this appointment should have sufficient time at his  disposal, and should also  be vested Avith sufficient authority to enable him to translate into practical form the general principles which will be given him for guidance.  He should obviously become an  ex officio member of theDepartmental Committee.     8.  The next question that  arises is that  of  staff  for  the  Air RaidsCommandant.   As a matter of principle it is thought that this staff  should be small, but should have the widest possible authority to consult any authorities or
persons concerned with the preparation of schemes, and should, if necessary, havepower to co-opt additional members ad hoc for any special purposes.    9.   Frojn the general point of view it would appear to be necessary that oneof the staff should be a representative of the Police,  since they will be responsiblefor the general control  of  London.  It would  also seem desirable to have arepresentative of the Ministry of Transport on the staff, since the organisationand control of all means of locomotion will be of primary importance.    10.  The two other matters which may also be ranked in the first flight arethose  connected with the Medical and Decontamination organisations,  and thoseconnected with the supply of food and  other necessities of life, and for these purposes it would seem  rational to complete the staff with a representative fromthe Ministry of Health  and the War Office (for advice on matters relating  toanti-gas  defence) and  also from the Board  of  Trade.   This would  appear  toprovide,  pending further experience, a nucleus representative of, and in  touchwith,  the primary services on which the successful organisation  of  London will depend to a considerable extent.    11.  There remains only the question of a second  in command, if. in fact,such  an  appointment is desirable.   For a  variety of reasons there  would  be considerable  advantage in such an addition to  the staff, and this appointmentmight, at the outset, provide a convenient opportunity for closely linking the directive organisation with the administrative organisation.   It  is, in fact,suggested that the Secretary of the existing Air Raids Committees might hold the appointment of Chief of Staff to the Air Raids Commandant, at any rateduring the preliminary stages of the organisation, though at a later date it maybe found necessary  to  arrange for the whole-time appointment of  a  selectedindividual.    12.  Briefly, then, it is suggested that there should be created the following-organisation  for London, which would be set up in peace time, and would  be composed as follows :          An  Air Raids Commandant (the Governor of Chelsea Hospital or the             Lieutenant of the Tower).         A Chief of Staff.         A Representative of the Police.         A Representative of the Ministry of Transport.         A Representative of the Board of Trade.         A Representative of the Ministry of Health.         A Representative of the War Office (for advice on anti-gas defence).    It is realised that, in the early stages, the work involved will  be considerable,:and,  if it  is  to be well  and expeditiously  completed,  may necessitate special arrangements in the Departments concerned.    13.  As  regards the actual work to be carried  out by this new organisation,naturally the details will have to be carefully considered, but as a general rule itis thought that the following principles would be found suitable.    14.  The Ministerial and  Departmental Committees to  continue  to operate as at  present; their work, however, should be, so  far as possible, confined to thatof laying down the general principles for the conduct of Air Raids  services andfor effecting co-operation and co-ordination with all the various authorities, both public and private, who are or may be concerned  in the various Air Raids plans;the actual preparation of schemes and working out of details to  be  handed overto the Air Raids Commandant and his staff.    15.  It  is anticipated  that a good deal of  the work of  the Air RaidsCommandant will be of a supervisory nature, but time and experience  alone will show  how far it will be necessary for this  new organisation itself to  prepareschemes, or how far it will be necessary for these schemes to be prepared by thosewho will actually be responsible for their execution  in detail.    As has been already stated, the Air  Raids Commandant will be ex officio a  member of theDepartmental Committee, and the very closest liaison must in any case be  main-tained  between  these  organisations;  it is  anticipated,   in  fact,  that the commandant should  be free  to associate himself  with the work of  any Sub-Committees which the Main Committee may set up  from time to time.
     16.  It is obviously essential that the Air Raids Commandant  is given, inconcise form,  a set of working principles on which to base his executive organi-sation, and for this purpose a handbook is in course of preparation, modelled onthe one which  has been issued by the French Ministry of the Interior, and to which reference is made in the  accompanying report* dealing with the question of publicity.     17.  A very general outline  only has  been attempted of the change it isproposed should be effected in the existing Air Raids Precautions Organisation.It is felt, however, that a stage has been reached in the course of preparation whenit is necessary to divorce what may be termed theory  and practice,  and theopinion  has  been  formed,  after mature  consideration,  that   the  war  timeorganisation originally envisaged would prove  unsuitable in the light of theparticular needs of the situation: and if this assumption is correct, it is obviouslydesirable from every point of view to amend this organisation in time of  peace,rather than to be forced in time of war to make alterations which might gravelyaffect the efficiency of the  schemes and might  even, under the worst conditions.prejudice the safety of the  capital.

This Report was approved by the Air Raids Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee                 at its  Fifth  Meeting  held  on October 17,  1932.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Air Raids Precautions.          PUBLICITY.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 181-A.)     Report by the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee.     ON the 13th November,  1930, a special report* was submitted requesting:permission to extend  somewhat  the  scope  of the activities  of the Air  raids precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee,  which hitherto had been restricted by the need for preserving secrecy as  to the preparations involved.     The Committee of Imperial Defence at its meeting held on the  19th March,1931,f  agreed to this request,  which had been  endorsed  by  the Air  raids precautions (Policy) Sub-Committee, in the following terms :           &quot; To approve  the  report of  the  Air  Raids  Precautions  (Policy)     Sub-Committee, requesting authority for circulation and co-operation outside     Government circles, subject to the stipulation that such consultation should     be  made  with discretion  and to every precaution being  taken  to  avoid     misrepresentation.&quot;     2.  In accordance with this recommendation, we were enabled to spread ournet a little wider, though any responsible officials outside the  Government circleto whom  our  confidence was given had still strictly to be enjoined to secrecy.Therefore, progress  was still  artificially restricted, and  it was found  almost impossible to  proceed  very far in  the practical implementation of schemes ofprotection against Air attack, even though many of these schemes had reached a stage of theoretical finality.     3.  We have from time to time, in our annual reports  and elsewhere, drawn attention  not only to the activities of  foreign countries, but also  to the  publicity which  is  freely accorded to everything connected with  the protection of their civil population  against air  attack.   This  volume of publicity  has steadilyincreased  as a natural corollary to the evident energy with which the  prepara-tion and execution of  Schemes have been pushed forward, and  we can find no evidence to show that these  preparations are regarded, either nationally orinternationally,  as anything but normal measures of self-defence to  which every member of the League of Nations is entitled under Article 8 of the  Covenant.     4.   It is not without interest to  recall that France, Germany  and Hollandhave all prepared for publication handbooks,  during the past two years,  in which  * C.T.1).

the principles of passive air defence are marshalled, the responsibility for thepractical evolution and execution of schemes is clearly fixed, and sufficient detailis included to enable the instructions  to be intelligently  interpreted.   Based onthese practical instructions, exercises have been held in co-operation with the AirForce (in  the case of Germany, with civil aviation)  to test the organisation, to practise officials in their duties,  and to ensure that  the population understandswhat it has to do.  This year in Germany full-scale exercises have been held inKonigsberg, and in France, not only have the local organisations been tested atMich places as Marseilles, Dijon and Lyons, but  the whole department of the pas-de-Calais was  recently  submitted  to  a  three-day  passive  air defence.programme.    5.  A French handbook, with six  annexes, is on sale in France at any book-seller,  as  also  are handbooks prepared  by other countries.  Marshal Petain,who was recently appointed head of the Air Defence of France, has been presentin person  at all  the important exercises and has held a civic reception  at all the towns visited Avhere he has delivered an address to the officials of the municipali-ties concerned, outlining their duties  and responsibilities,  and emphasising thenational importance of  their  work.   These ^activities have been fully reportedin the Press.    6.  Although we have taken such care to keep our activities quiet, we havenot received  credit  for  maintaining an  impassive attitude.  Quite recently ahandbook  of  instructions to German factories was received which contained, atthe beginning, an account of the alleged passive air defence measures being takenin other countries and included the statement that  in our case such training waspart of the curriculum of all  our schools!    7.  Briefly  then  we have arrived  at a position where  we cannot translateour ideas  into practice without incurring a measure of publicity and, although we believe we began to consider this problem before other nations and may indeed be still ahead of them in matters of general design, we have been left far behindin  the development and experimental application  of working plans.  In  airwarfare,  as  is well known, attacks are liable  to be launched  with startlingsuddenness at the outbreak of war, or even before a formal declaration has beenmade; and, consequently, previous defensive preparations  are essential.   Whenit is recalled that modern aircraft can reach London from the Coast in 15-20minutes and that London is perhaps,  not only the  most vital,  but also one ofthe most vulnerable capitals in the western hemisphere, the necessity for adequatepreparation need  hardly be emphasised.   The consequences of surprise are  toocalamitous even to contemplate.    8.  We have put forward suggestions in another paper* for the remodellingof the existing Air Raids organisation, which, if accepted, will, we hope, enablethe practical and executive side of our work to be pushed to its logical conclusions.But the proposals we have made cannot be put into effect without the co-operationof  local authorities  and the civil population itself and, as a corollary, we arenow asking that we may be released from our existing obligations of secrecy.    9.  We are aware that movements are on foot to prohibit chemical warfare and to reduce or even abolish certain types of armaments, and that, in consequence,it may  be said  the  present moment is inopportune to  initiate a campaign of publicity  in this country.  Against this argument we would  recall firstly, that every nation possesses the unalienable right to take such measures as it may desire for its national defence under Article 8 of the  Covenant, and that passive  air defence clearly is included under this heading, and is so considered by every other country.  Even  France has never objected to such preparations by Germany.     Secondly, that until war  has been abolished or made impossible, there must remain  a  definite risk that it will occur,  and that  so long as this risk  exists, nocountry is justified in failing to take  such reasonable precautions  as will enable it to withstand  the first shock and maintain an unbroken defensive front whileits resources are being mobilised.     Thirdly, that one of the most important measures to be taken in  defeatingenemy air attacks is the maintenance of public morale, and that without previouspreparation it may be impossible to dissipate or control the not unnatural panicwhich the sudden materialization of the unknown may engender.                             * O.I.D. Paper No. 188-A.
    Fourthly, that  since foreign countries have accorded such full measure of publicity to all their passive air defence preparations without in any way affecting-ad adversely national sentiment or  international relations, it is difficult to see how the knowledge that we were following the continental lead could have  any effectother than perhaps expressions of mild surprise that we should have waited solong.    Fifthly, that publicity is essential to efficiency, and, at the best, a good manyyears must elapse before efficiency is achieved.    10.  We submit, therefore,  that we may now be permitted to carry out our work unrestricted by such measures of secrecy as have been hitherto imposed.In making this request we would emphasise that we do not propose, or desire, thatour preparations should be made subject to any press &quot; stunts &quot; ; but rather that,since we shall make no secret of what we are doing, information will just percolateout and can  be  discreetly guided as necessary along the  lines we  desire. Theappointment of an Air Raids Commandant, if approved, might be announced ina carefully worded  communique or made the subject of a pronouncement  in theHouse.   Such details, however, can best be considered as they arise, and we asknow for a free hand, subject only to the proviso that we shall proceed to educatethe public gradually and  in such a manner as will  preclude any possibility ofunfortunate reactions or our intentions being misinterpreted either in this country or abroad.

(1)-AIR  RAIDS PRECAUTIONS.                (A) Suggested Administrative Organisation.                        (C.I.D. Paper No. 188-A.)    THE COMMITTEE had  under consideration a Note by  the Chairman ofthe Air  Raids Precautions (Organisation)  Sub-Committee,  on the suggestedadministrative organisation for Air Raids Precautions Services (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 188-A).    THE PRIME  MINISTER said that  this Report  contained a suggestedadministrative organisation for Air  Raids Precautions Services.   The  mainproposal, which was stated in paragraph 12 of the Report, was to the effect thatthere should be an Air Raids Commandant, who might be either the Governor ofChelsea Hospital or the Lieutenant of the Tower, and who should have a smallstaff to assist him, consisting mainly of existing departmental officers.    LORD HAILSHAM said that the Committee had suggested two alternativesfor the post of Air Raids Commandant,  and the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs had made a particular point of stating that  the question of age was animportant factor.  If this was the case the natural appointment would  be the lieutenant of the Tower, because he was still on the active  list, whereas theGovernor of Chelsea had finished his active service.   There were, however, other points to be considered.  The Lieutenant of the Tower served only for three years,and in the event of war would at once be given  an  important command.  TheGovernor of Chelsea Hospital,  on the other hand, served  for seven years, and intime of war would probably remain where he was.    He understood from theReport that, to begin with  at any rate, a good deal  of work would be involved,and it  so happened  that Sir Walter Braithwaite,  who was the present governor of Chelsea, was a first-class man and had sufficient leisure, and, moreover,  shouldbe  available throughout the important time when  the oi&apos;ganisation was  beingframed.   In addition, he would be available if war  broke out.  Having regardto these factors, he would recommend that Sir Walter Braithwaite was given theappointment.     In answer to a question from Mr. Thomas, he said that his (Sir WalterBraithwaite&apos;s) age was sixty-seven.     SIR JOHN GILMOUR said that his only anxiety was to  have somebody on whom to rely in time of war, and that he had felt a little doubtful on the questionof  age.   Everyone,  however,  knew  Sir  Walter  Braithwaite, and he had no hesitation in saying that he thought he would be  a most excellent person to hold the appointment.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the first thing was, he thought, to take in hand  the question of organisation, and he understood from  Sir John Gilmourthat the appointment of Sir Walter Braithwaite was  entirely acceptable.     SIR JOHN GILMOUR agreed.       [7835-1]
    THE PRIME MINISTER then said that he thought the Committee could accept the Report of the Air Raids Precautions  (Organisation) Sub-Committeewhich ought, he presumed, to be forwarded to the Cabinet.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a) To  accept  the  recommendations  for  setting  up  an  administrative          organisation  for  Air Raids Precautions  Services,  including the          appointment of an Air Raids Commandant with a small departmental          staff;    (b) That, from the point of view of continuity and availability  in time of          emergency,  the appointment of Air Raids Commandant should be          vested in the Governor of Chelsea Hospital, who is at present General          Sir Walter P. Braithwaite, G.C.B.                               (B) Publicity.                         (C.I.D. Paper No. 189-A.)    (Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 252nd Meeting, Minute 1.)    THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the second memorandum, which was really complementary to the first, a request was put forward that the work inconnection with Air Raids Precautions Services might be carried on unrestrictedby the partial secrecy hitherto adopted.  He&quot;felt little doubt that if publicity wasgiven in this matter, it might conceivably create some unsettlement, particularly at the present time when Disarmament discussions were proceeding at Geneva.He presumed that Sir John Gilmour had taken this point into consideration.    SIR JOHN GILMOUR said that every other  country, including France andGermany, was busy educating its public on this subject, and it seemed to him thatwe might lay ourselves open to grave reproach in the future if we continued to do nothing about this important subject.    MR. THOMAS  asked  whether it was necessary to have publicity at thepresent moment.   It seemed to him that in this  country we were always beingcriticised for things of this kind and, having regard particularly to the discussionsnow proceeding on Disarmament and the further consideration which the cabinet were directing to this problem, might it not be better to hold our hand for a little time ?    SIR JOHN GILMOUR said that the difficulty was that no further progress could be made in regard to  setting  up the administrative  organisation without some  increase in publicity.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that information had only come to lightyesterday that, in fact, we really had  more publicity  than was supposed, and Inreferred particularly to two pamphlets published  respectively by the Red Crossand  St. John&apos;s Ambulance Society, dealing with  first aid to gas casualties.  Itappeared  that these pamphlets had been on  sale  everywhere for the last  threeyears and had not caused any comment whatsoever so far as he knew.    MR. THOMAS said that he was so much afraid that the Press would fastenon to anything of this kind and make a &apos;&apos; stunt &apos;&apos; out of it.    SIR  MAURICE HANKEY said that the sort of publicity contemplated would go  very little beyond what was contained in these handbooks.    THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that  surely it  must include  somedemonstrations at some time or another.    SIR  MAURICE  HANKEY  agreed,  but  pointed  out  that  suchdemonstrations could not take place for some time as the  Committee were notnearly ready for this part of their programme.    THE PRIME MINISTER said in that case he thought that the committee could  agree  with the Report and  that the Conclusion should be  worded in
-accordance with the suggestion in paragraph 10.  The Report should then, he-thought, be forwarded to the Cabinet.                               CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     (a) To approve the Report of the Air Raids Precautions (Organisation) Sub-          Committee, requesting full discretion in  regard to publicity  on the          understanding that such publicity will be gradual and will be carried          out in such a manner as will preclude any possibility of unfortunate          reactions or of our intentions  being misinterpreted either in this          country  or  abroad;    (6) That  OLD.  Papers 188-A  and  189-A,  together  with the  recom-          mendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence thereon,  should          be forwarded to  the Cabinet.         ******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,      November 8, 1932.
