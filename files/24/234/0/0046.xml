(j o Jof Education recently established in London to serve as an imperial centre for post-graduate study and research.,            Partly by such discussions, but no less by theopportunity which it offers for personal contacts,  theConference serves a valuable purpose in bringing togethermembers of the British Commonwealth and in combating the danger that certain of the Dominions may tend to look to countries outside the Empire, e.g. to the United States, for educationalinspiration.            In view of the recommendation of the AdvisoryCommittee and of the wider issues of imperial co-operation which are involved, I think it very undesirable that the next meeting of the Conference should be indefinitely postponed.The only expenditure falling on the Home Government would beabout  1,000, mainly in respect of Government hospitality.            I have consulted my colleagues the Secretaries ofState for Scotland, the Colonies, the Dominions and India, andthey agree generally with me that every effort should be made tohold a Conference in 1904,   The Secretary of State for theColonies however expressly makes his support of the proposalconditional on a decided improvement in economic conditions inthe Colonial Empire before 1934,            The final decision as to holding a Conference in thatyear will in any case have to be taken nearer the time on thebasis of the replies received to invitations and in the light ofeconomic conditions as then existing;  but, as initial steps haveto be talc en now if there is to be any question at all of aConference in 1934, I ask the approval of the Cabinet to myapproaching the Oversea Governments accordingly.                                             I.                                    November 16th,  1932.
