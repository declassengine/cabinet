November 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.    9CP.  378 (32).                                CABINET.MALTA.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    WITH  reference to CP. 372 (32) and the discussion at the Cabinet Meetingon Wednesday, the 2nd November, I am circulating herewith, for the informationof my colleagues, copies of further telegrams which have passed between me andthe Governor of Malta, on the  political situation.    It was necessary to send the Governor immediate instructions with regardto the action which he should take in the contingency referred to in his telegramNo. 129 of the 2nd November; and, after consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and with  the approval of  the Prime Minister, I  informed sir David Campbell, in the terms of my telegram No. 114 of 3rd November, thatif Ministers tendered their  resignations he should give them  plain warning ofwhat the consequences would be.  If they insisted on resigning, he should accept their resignations and proclaim that the Secretary of State is satisfied that a grave emergency has arisen within the  meaning of Section  41  (1) of the malta constitution Letters Patent of 1921, and that pursuant to the provisions of thisSection he accordingly  suspends the Constitution and assumes the government ofthe Island.    Given the situation envisaged by the Governor, this course appeared to bethe only possible one to take.                                                 (Initialled)      P. C.-L.    Downing Street, S.W.1,       November  5, 1932.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Malta to the Secretary of State for.                                the Colonies.                         Dated 2nd November, 1932.                  (Received 1-36 P.M. 2nd November, 1932.)    No. 129.   Secret.  Your telegrams No.  108, Secret, and No. 110, Secret.    It is, I suggest, desirable to consider in advance steps to be taken shouldMinisters resign on receiving an intimation as in your telegram No.  109, Secret.If this were to happen, and I called upon Opposition to form a Government, youwill realise,  of  course,  that  the  latter could  carry no  legislation  through parliament.  I agree entirely with your view that fresh election  must in no circumstances be held on the  language issue.  If  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be forced  ultimately  to suspend Constitution again, I  should like to seethis step deferred until Nationalist Administration has had, if possible,  say, twoyears of office, and thus had time to make a considerable section of public opinionwelcome a return to Crown Colony Government.  But it is a question whether, ifthis is made impossible  by the immediate resignation of Ministers and by the       [7821]
necessity of avoiding holding election for the reasons given above, it would notbe better for His Majesty&apos;s Government to reply to Ministers&apos; resignation by theimmediate suspension or repeal of the Constitution, rather than to suspend orrepeal the  latter  after  some  weeks  or months  of  a  futile  and  impotentConstitutionalist Ministry hopelessly out-voted in Parliament.  The nationalist party and their friends abroad would in the latter event accuse His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of suspending  the  Constitution  merely because it  could  not  keepthe Constitutionalist party in power, while suspension of the Constitution wouldin the former event appear to follow logically upon Ministers&apos; recalcitrancy.    Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the                             Governor of Malta.                     (Sent 9-30 P.M. 3rd November, 1932.)     IMPORTANT.  NO. 114. Secret.  Your telegram No. 129, Secret.     If Ministers insist on resignation  they will be declaring in effect that theyrefuse to govern in accordance with the Constitution.  This action would creategrave emergency which would not only justify and compel His Majesty&apos;s  Govern -ment to suspend Constitution until such time  as Ministers are willing to complywith its provisions.  If Ministers do tender their resignations you must give thema plain warning of what the consequences will be.   If they insist on resigningyou should accept their resignation and proclaim that the Secretary of  State is satisfied that grave emergency has arisen by reason of which general interests ofHis Majesty&apos;s subjects resident in  the  Island and preservation  and continuanceof peace, order and good government therein are endangered and the carrying on of responsible Government under the Constitution  Letters Patent is prejudiced,and that pursuant to section  41 (1) of the above-mentioned Letters Patent  andthe Letters  Patent dated 14th April, 1921, constituting office of Governor  and commander-in-Chief of Malta you assume the Government of the Island.     There would not be any  justification for asking the Opposition to form aGovernment.  This course would be open to every objection.
