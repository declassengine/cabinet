RESOLUTION.

The Empire Resources Development Committee while anxious to refrain from any action calculated to ambarress His Majesty&apos;s Government in the conduct of peace negotiations desire neverthle? to express the strong hope and conviction that the return to Germany of any of her conquered Colonies at the end of the War should be refused, for the following reasons:-

(1) The record of Germany&apos;s administration on the continent of Africa and elsewhere, and in particular the ? inhumanity she has displayed in her dealiag?  with aboriginal natives, all stamp her as unfitted to be entrusted again with the guardianship of any of these peoples.

(2) Her continued occupation of these regions would be a standing menace to the peace and security of the world, on the ground -

(a) that they would be used as naval and military bases from which to organise attacks by land and sea upon her neighbours:

 
             (b)   that the supplies of talu&amp;hle raw m&amp;teri&amp;lg                  which can be drawn tram them are ossenti&amp;l                  to the re-building of her schemes of                  aggrandisement in Europe end in Asia.         On   grounds of security,  therefore,  she should be       deprived of the opportunities which th$ possession       of these regions would continue to confer upon her*(3)   The return to Germany of Colonies in the  conquest of       t?hich  Overseas troops of the Smpire have clayed such       a valiant  $nil important pert would occasion profound       disappointment in ths Lominions and territories from       which  those troops have been drawn, and v:ould not       improbably arouso such a sense of injustice and       injury as  nio*ht tend to weaken the bonds of Empire       unity, at  a time vhon it is  vital to strengthen       ti-ose  ties to the utmost possible extent.8 Whitehall Gardens,  S.r.6     March 5thk  1918,
