(Memorandum by  the Chief Secretary).     My presence in Dublin has enable? me  to  learn  from  Members ofthe Convention and fro;:: leaders of Nationalist  opinion outside  theConvention, something of the views which have been  formed,  amongmen who desire peace in the country,  of the suggestions  forsettlement embodied In the Prime iiinister^s letter  to Sir Horacexlunkett,   The letter was real in the Convention on Tuesday last,under sat very favourable conditions,  I believe; and its contentsare now known to most of the active politicians, and many of theleading people of oil sorts throughout the country.     Among the criticisms of which I  am aware,  the  most  powerfuland serious is contained in a letter  written  by the Roman CatholicPrimate, Cardinal I,ogua.   The Cardinal is, I believe, the  mostinfluential man in Ireland, and ho probably has more influencethan any other five men could exercise.    His letter stronglyopposes the idea of an Ulster Committee with  &amp;  veto, and also thatof special treatment of Belfast as a  place for  alternate meetingsof the Parliament and the seat of Government  in matters  of  commerceand industry,   3e would also reject  a settlement which  did notprovide for Irish control of customs  and excise  at  some  definedperiodt though not during the progress of  the war.   He  winds uphis letter v?Itb these obeervctiona:-         &quot;It may be uncharitable, but I find  it  hard to  resist  the     conviction that this whole business,  Convention and all, is     a pift^e of clever play - it would bo disrespectful to call     it jockeying - to keep the Irish question  floating till the     war is over ant? then leave Sinn  ?ein, Carsoniera and Socialism     to fight each other over the fate of  unfortunate Ireland,     This is the view which the public will certainly take  of     futile proposals of settlement.   Hence  I  believe it is the     duty of the Nationalist members  of the Convention to insist     on the earliest possible report,  or reports, as the case may     be, ana lcavo*9the &quot;Government the  responsibility of  acting,  or     refusing- to act on the report of the  majority.M     X*r.I&apos;eHugh, Roman Catholic Bishop of Berry,  is  an advancednationalist end a leader of the uncompromising  school of nationalistopinion,, but a law-abiding man vsho has not, so far  as I  am  aware,lent any countenance to revolutionary action.   He has writtenvarious letters about the situation which  I have seen.   like theCardinal he is sceptical of the good  faith of the Government  inits dealings with Ireland, and especially with the Convention.It woul*? not be useful to examine in  detail his angry criticismsof the various suggestions of possible settlement which  are  con-.tained in the Prime Minister7s letter to.the  Convention.    As tofinance, he thinks that what is designed-fto maintain the existingsystem of taxation until after the war in order that &quot;when  thetaxes of Ireland have been raised from the  original  11,000,000to about  40,000,000 or  50,000,000&quot; Ireland may bo &quot;saddled  forall time with the cost of a war from which  she derives no advantage,not even the temporary advantage of having millions soent in  thecountry,&quot;
     Br.MeHugk agrees, broadly speaking, with Cardinal logue asto Finance, as to the proposal for making Belfast a Seat ofGovernment. and as to the suggested right of vete of an UlsterCommittee.    As to the problem of safe-guards he writes ae followin discussing the Prime Minister *s letter.          &quot;Strange how ho brushes aside the proposal for increased     representation for the Unionists, which ts the only possible     solution of the difficulty, and  Jumps at the very ob^eetionabl     idea of an Ulster Committee with power  to exoluae the app-     lioation to Ulster of certain measure? &amp;c.   tftioover heard     of such e proposal under any constitution?  What a caricature     of a Parliament the Irish Assembly would bo with the right of     veto vested in a minority!  Surely if the Unionists had     increased representation and a right to appeal to a combined     session of the two Houses, it should be sufficient safeguard&apos;,     ^HIs suggestloh of an Ulster Committee is perhaps the most     insulting as it is the most objectionable of all     If there be any attempt at settlement on the lines (suggests     I predict a pandemonium ........*.*  The simple solution of     the question is Home ^ule for all Ireland, with Customs,     Sxcise, Post Office, Police &amp;c, increased representation     for Ulster and the Unionists of the South, with an appeal to     a Combines Session of the two Houses when they think they     have a grievance.   If this plan were adopted it would bring     peace to Ireland, support to England, anfl might mean victory     in the ^ar.&quot;     I have refrained from reporting a great deal of interestinginformation which has reached me during my present stay in Irelandwith regard to the doings and prospects of the Convention.   AllI hear satisfymme that the hour for a final decision of thequestions involved is very near at hand.   I have present to mymind the fact that in suppressing the latest crop of seditiousand agrarian disturbances, as we are doing, the Government has onthe whole the support which the !icman hierarchy can give.  And inview of all the circumstances cf the time, I thirl: the opinionsof two very prominent members of that class are worthy of seriousconsideration.fSd)   H.J3.DUE2.Dublin,   March 4th, 19X8.
