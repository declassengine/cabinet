The whole life of laru andof Tiflia depends on Batoum and the question Is can we helpthese people to raaist the surrender of Batoum, should they beprepared to do so.          Our occupation of Baghdad gives us, I thinks thepossibility of doing this provided we have Persia in friendlyneutrality with us,          V/0 ought to be able to&apos; raise sufficient men amongstthe Bakhtiaris and other Persian Tribesmen to safeguard thePersian Border  ron&amp;urdish raids and we already ha-ve a number ofBritish officers in Persia.          With a Fared of this sort and the backing of someIndian Cavalry we ought to be able to transport half a dozen,or a doses,  armed motor or oil-driven Launches, constructed inSections, from Baghdad by the Khanikin read up tc Resht andBnseli on the Caspian;  there to bo put together tc police theCaspian Boa.   With these wo could command Baku and all the oilcentres on both sides of that sea*   &quot;i?e should also be able tocontrol the Baku-Rostov Railway and be thus in direct eommani-e&amp;tion with the Don Cossack Headquarters at JWovooherkask, quite ret from all possibility of German intervention,  if the Cossackswere with US.   n&amp; should also command the rail from Baku toTiflis and Batoum.          Should the occasion arise therefore for us to interveneta help Russia against the Germans Baku seems to me to bo a mostimportant ^umping-off place.   There are no armoured ships at allon the Caspian that I know of end the few armed ships that theRussians have there ere so small that a good gun mounted on aMotor launch ought, I shoiild think,  to be able to sink them ifresistance wag offered;  bat on this you must consult the Admiralty
Whfe% the present attitude of the nussian sailors on the Caspiis of oourse X cannot say but if the people of the Caucasusare with us 3-ermsny ought not to be abls to get up any biggiuas against us before we arrive.          Our appearance at Baku would have an enormous.moraleffect, even if we did nothing more;  but I will not go-intofurther detail now.          All I would ask is that you will kindly lay thesuggestion before the Ear Cabinet for their considerationand if I can be of any us8 to them in the matter you may besure I am only too ready.                             Yours sincerely,                      (Signed)   CHAS. 3, YAT3.IIG0T)y of letter dated 11th March 1918 from Secretary, WarBear Oelonel Yate,          ilany thanks for your Interesting letter of the11th of March, 1518*   I am circulating it to the V.*ar Cabinsand to tho various Departments which are mainly concerned isPersian and Trans-Oauoasian affairs.
