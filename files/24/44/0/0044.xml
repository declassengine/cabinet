(This Document is the Property ofhhm 1183615/18OUTPUT OF BEER.reductions in-the -nerraitted standard barrelage of beer i-ith aview to- the saving.of tonnage. .     The Boc.rd desire to represent to the- War Cabinet (1) that im-portant. as;the question of tonnage is, there are other aspects ofthe: question which require to be considered before a decision isreached, and (2) that if, on grounds of tonnage or conservation offood supplies,, some reduction of the standard barrelage becomesnecessary, steps should still be taken to maintain -the bulk barrel-8ge at the amount now? available.     The Board believe that, so far as the last year is concerned,the shortage of intoxicating liquor has involved more risk to thegeneral efficiency of the nation than any that is to be fearedunder present conditions from excessive drinking...  This shortagehas been responsible not only for a certain, amount of actual unrest,,.but also for some of the excessive drinking and danger. :t&apos;o publicorder observed in.some localities during the past 1? months,.sineemany men Will scramble for drinks^ and will drink to excess, vhendrink is to be had during a period of famine,, who would refrainfrom doing so if they could count on the maintenance of a steady andeven supply.-.    The events of the -oast few months,..indeed,..suggestthat:the Board&apos;s apprehension that the sudden reduction of thestandard barrelage from 26 millions to .15 millions ( the figurefirst proposed by the Food Controller in January,  1917)  might&apos;cause                                                                    35hardly less irritation and unrest than a policy -of total prohibition,was by-.no merns without justification. .     The loW figure of 10-million standard barrels v/as fixed inFebruary-1917,- and some alleviation has since been afforded,and /  See War Cabinet Paper,  Gv 116 ..of 19,17., ,An^endix II.
and incipient unrest has &quot;been checked, by the increases inthe output which have been allowed during each of the lastthree quarters.     To reduce again the material availableso as to involve a decrease in the present bulk barrelage,except on grounds of overwhelming national necessity, ex-plained and accepted as such, .twould, in the Board1 s view,be to risk the spread of discontent amongst men engagedupon essential war industries to an extent which would bedetrimental to the successful prosecution of the ware  Thisrisk should be carefully weighed against the net saving oftonnage which it is proposed to secure.   Moreover, the Boardfear that, if restriction of the output of boer is pushedtoo far, there will sooner or later be a re-action which willendanger the whole advance in national sobriety which hasbeen attained during the last throe years.    On the&apos; otherhand, they see no reason why under a steady policy of regula-tion the whole national benefit which has accrued should notbe permanently maintained^     The Board therefore desire to submit that,  if it isthought right that the consumption of beer and spirits shouldbe allowed to continue, it is1 desirable in the national.in-terest that they should be available in such quantity as isconsistent with  reasonable contentment.   It is urgently nec-essary that the high standard of sobriety which has beenattained should be preserved during the continuance -of thewar, and the Boards experience-goes to shew that the contin-uance of this high standard may reasonably be  looked for,provided that efficient regulations can be maintained.-   Theprecise figure below which the bulk barrelage: of beer, shouldnot be allowed to fall may bo difficult to fix,  but it issafe to say thatwith the present means  of distribution,the&apos; &quot;existing,  figure  (nearly - 20 / -       - -
20 millions) should at least he maintained.   (Thisoould be done, end materials eould at the same time besaved by a reduction of the standard barrelage,  if stepscould be taken to. lower the gravity of the heavier beersstill being brewed^   It is in this direction that theBoard would recommend that aetion should be taken, ifconsiderations of tonnage are held to necessitate acurtailment of the materials available for brewing,8th March 1918c
