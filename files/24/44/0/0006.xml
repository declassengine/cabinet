WEEKLY REPORT ON ITALY. XXVIII.                      (March 1, 1918).     The alarm produced in Italy by the interpretation put uponW Lloyd George1s and President Wilson&apos;s New Year speeches hadpractically subsided before Parliament reassembled on February 12.Press demands for a collective statement of Allied War Aims, andeven those for an explicit statement from Signor Orlando, had beendropped.     This we believe to have been in large measure due to anarticle (summarised in our Pres, e.g.  k es, February 7),,whichappeared in the Tribuna on February 6, and which attracted muchattention.  The Editor, Malagodi, there affirmed that &quot;the Italianthesis and Italian interests had gained the day at Versailles&quot;,the Austrophil movement in England, France and the U.S. havingcollapsed so soon as it became apparent that Austria merelyintended to profit by Russia&apos;s broak-down in order to get closerto Germany.   This change of attitude had perhaps been facilitatedby generous and reasonable concessions on the part of Italy,concessions rendered possible by the changed situation producedby the collapse of Russia and Russian Pan-Slavism;  and it was notimpossible that Sonnino himself had accepted the dismembermenttheory in favour not only of Czechs and Poles, but of Jugc-Slavs.     These affirmations v^ere apparently based on informationobtained by the TribanaJ s Paris Correspondent, who, in a letter(published on February 7), says that he knoWe&apos;&quot;on the best authority&quot;that all reasons for uneasiness on Italy&apos;s part were dispelled atVersailles;  that Italy could count on the fullest support forher Allies in obtaining her national frontier in the Rhaetlan and
Julian Alps, with the Northern part of the Adriatic.  At Versailles,it was added, Montenegro was also discussed, &quot;on a basis ofperfect equality with the other Balkan States (here the Censorintervenes)  ...... None the less, Serbia and Montenegro wereassured of having the collective support of Allied diplomacy.The idea of negotiating separately with Austria had been definitelyabandoned as impracticable.     The effect produced upon public opinion by these assurancescan hardly have been materially weakened by a communicationphonogrammed from Rome, to the Gazzetta del Popolo of February 6,in which Signor Bevione, no doubt inspired by the Consults, deniedthat there had been any modification in the Italian Government&apos;sprogramme, as repeatedly affirmed in communiques and officialdeclarations.   This contained no demand for a dismemberment ofAustria and no proposal for co-ordination of aims and effortswith the other nationalities under the Habsburg yoke.  TheItalian Government, since it did not include among its aims fehedemolition of Austria, could not, in its dealings with the Allies,without contradicting itself, become the protector of the BohemianSerbs, Jugo-Slavs and Poles.  Orlando and Sonnino had, according toBev*0ne&apos;s information, limited themselves at Versailles to demandingthat the reasons for the alarm caused in Italy by the excessivebrevity of the references to Italy in Mr Lloyd George&apos;s andPresident Wilson&apos;s speeches, should be dissipated, and they haddemonstrated the righteousness of Italy&apos;s claims.   They hadsuoceeded in their aim and had received entire satisfaction.  As toconcessions on the part oijf Italy, the Government had no intentionof making anticipatory and gratuitous renunciations of what thetreaties assured to them.  A good understanding with the Serbs,Czechs, Poles and Jugo-Slavs was most desirable, but territorialadjustments must not precede but follow such accord.
     It will &quot;be seen that BevioneU statement hardly amounts toa denial of the substance of what the Tribuna had stated.  At anyrate, Italian public opinion seems to be satisfied that its fearswere groundless.     The Chamber of Deputies reassembled on February 12 and onFebruary 25, after speeches from all the Ministers whose policyhad been questioned voted confidence in the Government by alarge majority, adjourned until April 15. (fin account of theMinisters1 speeches will have to be reserved for our next Report)The Session was not remarkable for any Important debates.The normally numerous party distinctions have given place under.pressure of war conditions to a triple divj^ons (consisting of(1) the Interventionist League of National Defence, (2) theGiolittian - Clerical &quot;Parliamentary Union&quot;, and (3) the OfficialSocialists), and Deputies seems to be too much preoccupied withannoying or suppressing adversaries, by means of personal attacksand personal abuse, to have leisure for serious discussion.However, in spite of some violent altercations over the arrestof Lazzari and the responsibility oir &quot;Caporetto&quot;, the atmospherewas less disturbed and electrical than during recent sessionsand there was no concerted attack on Ministers.   The Governmentindeed, comes out with decidedly increased prestige, and SignorOrlando in particular seems to have conquered general respect byhis admirable combination of firmness with moderation andimpartiality in dealing with an extraordinarily difficultsituation.   Signor NittiTs direct appeal to the country and thealmost brutal frankness with which he has emphasised the realitieof the situation have also made a strong impression.   Eventhe position of Baron Sonnino, which had seemed to be in doubt,seems rather, for the present at least, to have been confirmed,and his speech on February 23 on the international situation and
                            *E .Italy&apos;s aims, is reported in sur Press as having been receivedwith enthusiasm.   This result,Which, in view of the discontentvith Sonninofs policy and attitude expressed on so many sidesduring recent discussions, may seem surprising, is probablyaccounted for &quot;by vhat has been pointed out above, viz. thatItalian politicians are now satisfied that, whatever reservesthe Government may have found it advisable to maintain, thesituation has really been cleared;  that one the one hand theAllies, though they may objeot to talking openly of the&quot;dismembement&quot; of Austria, have abandoned the hope of detachingher from Germany and have sanctioned an attitude on the&quot; part ofItaly towards the subject races which leads logically to thedisruption of the Dual Monarchy;  while on the Italian side,though, for the present, from motives of diplomatic caution andperhaps in order to allow more time for overeoming oppositionfrom Nationalists and Irredentists, and perhaps more formidableof all the Italian Naval Staff, no formal abandonment of theclaim to Dalmatia has been made, the Government is ready and hassignified to the Allies its readiness to remove that obstacleto an entente with the Slavs;  and so soon as it appearsexpedient Mill openly acknowledge the policy of championing theoppressed nationalities, abandoning in practice, if not inprofession, the principle of &quot;no dismemberment&quot;.    Indeed itseems inconceivable that so capable a diplomatist  as BaronSonnino should really insist on dinging to a policy vrhich mayhave been wise or necessary so long as Russia was in the field,but    is utterly inapplicable to the new problem created by theelimination of Russia.  Formerly Italy&apos;s Balkan and Danubian policyaimed at keeping the balance evon as between Austro-Germaninterests on the one hand and Russian Panslavism on the othorin order to secure her own footing in the Balkans.   The treaty ofApril 1C15 v,as from an Italian point of vicv a continuation of this
policy.  Dismemberment of Austria was not asked for and would havegiven Russia a dangerous preponderance.  The creation of a strongbuffer-State by unification of the Slav races was excluded byRussia&apos;s veto on the union of Catholic Croats with Orthodox Serbs.Italy, therefore, did the best she could to secure her positionin the Balkans against either Russia or Austria by claiminga large slice of the Dalmatian mainland.  The collapse of Russiafollowing the defeat of Serbia removes the counterpoise againstAustro-German expansion and leaves Italy to stem the tide alone.It must be obvious to Sonnino that her only hope lies now in firmalliance with a unified Slav State involving dismemberment ofAustria-Hungary.  Sonnino, it is felt, must have changed his policyto suit the entirely changed situation, and it is only his habitualcaution that restrains him from proclaiming the fact.   TheGovernment, willing the means, must will the end.     Meanwhile the movement towards an understanding with theSlavs is making good progress, as Signor Canepa told the SocialistConferences on February 22nd.   Evidence of this progress may beseen in the formation (reported in the Times of February 25) ofa &quot;Socialist Committee of understanding between Nationalities&quot;by the delegates v-ho at the recent Socialist Conference in Londonrepresented Labour or Socialist organisations in Rumania, Italy,Bosnia-Herzerovina and Serbia.  The delegates have issued amanifesto declaring that the object of the Committee is to workfor the recognition of the principles contained in the memorandumadopted by the London Conference, and laying down its plan ofaction.  The Comr-ittee is to have a permanent Secretariat inParis;  is to trganise conferences of the various groups, to studyall questions whick may arise between the nations and propose tothe Conferences the rules of procedure for the formation of newstates and the determination of the means of action.
     The manifesto, it was resalved, should be sent to the Czeoho-Slovak, Polish and Ruthenian Socialists with a request for theiradhesion.     M, Albert Thomas was elected President of the Association.&apos;     On behalf of Italian Labour and Socialism the manifestowas signed by all the delegates t-ho at the London Conferencerepresented the Italian Socialist Union, viz. Signori Oanepa,Area, Mantioa, Silvestri, Caetani, and Sestan.     At the London Conference the official Socialist Party ofItaly was represented by Signor Serrati (editor of Ayanti),Modighiani (Deputy), and Schiavi.     On the other side an &quot;irredentist Association&quot; is reportedto have been formed Kith headquarters in Rome having for  its objectto press for the fulfilment of Italy1s original war-aims.  It has 2sections, one concerned with, the interests and rights of Friuli,Trieste, iatria, Fiume and Dalmatia, the other v/ith those tf theTrentino and the Upper Adi^e region.     Attention was called in the Chamber on February 21 bySigner Pirolini, a o$6tdn magnate, to the contraband trade incotton and silk being carried on with the Central Empires throughSwitzerland with the connivance of the        (now nicknamed, hosaid, &quot;Societe sans scruples&quot;).   He named several firms vhich,he said, were in the service of Germany and pointed to thesuspiciously sudden expansion Sf a number of small busia^seesprofessedly of ?viss ownership,  fignor Pirolini demanded aGov rnmeht enquiry.&apos;     The Minister of Finance, Signor Meda, replying two days later,vent very fully into the whole question of cotton and Bilk exportsto Switzerland, in order to show that the Government,  whileanxious to avoid unnecessary disturbance of economic relations
1 ith Switzerland and to protect Italian commerce, had acted withgreat energy so soon as occasion arose.  An enquiry had at once&quot;been ordered into the abuses pointed out by Pirolini.     Telegrams to the English Press of February 26th report thearrest of two directors of the Lombard Silk Shred Company us theresult of a search made by the Italian secret police.     (In a former Report (No. XXIII, p.5) a statement was made inregard to Allowances to Soldiers&apos;  Families which requirescorrection.  It is not the case that &quot;there is no regularprovision of Separation Allowances&quot;$   Such Allowances are madein virtue of a series of laws and decrees which it is now proposedto co-ordinate in a single measure.  What is true- or was whenthe statement wag made - is that the Allowances were absurdlysmall - viz. about 7d per diem for the wife and 3d for each child.In the case of Italians enrolled in Great Britain the allowancesare supplemented from the funds of the &quot;Pro Italia&quot; charity).1.3.18.
