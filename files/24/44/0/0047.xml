FOOD PRODUCTION.

The long spell of weather favourable for outdoor operations was interrupted towards the end of last week by a heavy snowstorm.  Fortunately the effects of this passed away quickly and a return of suitable weather conditions for ploughing followed.  Seeding operations are being carried on and the land is generally reported to be in good condition for sowing.   The arrival of additional soldier labour has  helped to case the labour difficulty.

Machinery &amp; Implements - Tractor Ploughs

The amount ploughed per  tractor per week varies considerably according to the nature of the ;  fields ploughed,  and it is difficult in Scotland where farmers insist  on ploughing being done with ploughs of 8&quot; or 10&quot; cut to obtain the  acreage pv?,v week that can be got when a 14&quot; furrow is cut.  The record  fo:: Scotland GO far has been established in Forfarshire by an outfit  which ploughed 3-H acres in a week of 67  hours with the small con-  sumption of 9o gallons of paraffin.      The returns of the acreages ploughed havw not been received from  all counties but frura those received up to 16th February a total of  9153 acres  hua been ploughed by tractor.   For the throe weeks ending  16th February  411 acres were ploughed or an average of 11.6 acres  &apos;  per tractor per week.      A considerable amount of time was lost in the month of January  owing to a  hoary snow torn, when during a period of fourteen days  only 52 acrod we.ee ploughed with all tractors available.   The unfor-  tunate delay in procuring ploughs has hampered th* ^rork of Committee,  but it ia ejected that given another fortnight of suitable weather  )  the most of the eld grass land will be ploughed and in condition for  a owi ng cp er at i on a .      In potato growing districts Committees have used tractors supplied  by the Board for cultivating ground for potatoes, wMl-a in one or two  districtt! where ploughs v^vo not available the tractors wore employed  in assisting farmers to thresh the 1917 crop.5. Supply of labour  -  Stallion Leaders for 1918.      The Boa:?d have been in communication witli the K&amp;tional Service De-  partmcnt regarding th* release of stallion leaders from the Army for &apos;  the 1918 season.   An undertaking has been given that men with the  neoessary qualifications at present attacned to Agricultural Companies  will be released freely and also that an effort vili be made to ob-  &apos;-:  tain the services of othev stallion leaders who &amp;re at present sta-  tioned in this country and have be*n placed in one of the lower jnedical  categories.    All the o*n&amp;?s who have hcreos on the Board&apos;s Register  have been circularised to this effect and provided with the necessary  forms of application.   The number of applications r*?ceiv*?d to date  is small; but thece have ba*n forwarded for attention to the Nations J  Service Department.  Owners having ploughman in their employment who  are qualified to  l&apos;ad  &quot;stallions h*ve been advised to send their staJ -  lions out  this season  in cliargs of th*e* w*n and the National Service-  Department have pron.ia.od to provide substitutes for ordinary farm  work.6. Horse Lab our_-_Service o ^Mares^i n Jl&amp;I8^      The  increase  in the area of land under cultivation ha3 led to a  corresponding increase in  the amount of horse labour which has to be  perfoiisd  on farms throughout the country.   There is at present a  shortage in  the supply of horses and it is essential therefore that  farmers  should  so far  as possible make  the host possible use  of the  aniikals  Uisy poeecss.   Th? Boerd have, therefore, suggested  to far-  oers  that  in t*ce  coiling season  the  service of mares should be post-  poncd till  at lt;*st a  jsbnta  later  than  the normal date  in order that   the  maree  ia*y     Lopi  ct worfc  er, long  as  possible.   It has also been   euggect&amp;d/&apos;

The amount ploughed pertractor per week varies considerably according to the nature of the ;fields ploughed, and it is difficult in Scotland where farmers insiston ploughing being done with ploughs of 8&quot; or 10&quot; cut to obtain theacreage par week that can be got when a 14&quot; furrow is cut.  The recordfo:: Scotland co far has been established in Forfarshire by an outfitwhich ploughed 3-^ acres in a week of 67  houra with the small con-sumption of 96 gallons of paraffin.

Per the throe weeks ending1.6th l&apos;&apos;ebruary  411 acres were ploughed or an average of 11.6 acres  &apos;per tractor per week.    A considerable amount of time was lost in the month of Januaryowing to a hoary an arc torn, whsn during a period of fourteen daysonly 52 acr-od we.ee ploughed with all tractors available.   The unfor-tunate delay in procuring ploughs has hampered the ^rork of Committee,but it to o:&quot;oected that given another fortnight of suitable weather  -the most of the old grass land will be ploughed and in condition fora owing operations.

The Bo&amp;$d have been in eoasmunication with the K&amp;ulonal Service De-partmcnt regardin^ th* release of stallion leaders from tho Army for &apos;the 1918 season.   An undertaking has been given that men with theneoeseary qualifications at present attacned to Agricultural Companieswill be released freely and also that an effort will be made to ob-tain the services of oth&apos;r stallion leaders who     at present sta-tioned in this country and have be*n placed in one of the lower medicalcategories.    All the otrae.?s who hava horses on tha Boaad^s Register.&quot;have been circularised to this effect and provided with the necessaryforms of application.   The number of applications received to dateis small; but tha?*? have been forwarded for attention to the Nations jService Department.  Owners having ploughman in their employment whoare qualified to l&apos;.ad &quot;itailions h*ve been advised to send their staJ -lions out whia season in cksrge of th*s* rd*n and the National Service-Department have proniaod to provide substitutes for ordinary farmwork.Horse Labour_-_Sorvics of ^arastln,lQ18^    The inorease in the area of land under cultivation ha3 led to acorresponding increase in the amount of horse labour which has to beperfoxssod on farms throughout the country.   There is at present ashortage in the supply of houses and it ieessential therefore thatfarmers should so fax- as pcasiblo make tha best possible use of theanimals  V-ity poeeass.   The Board have, therefore, suggested to far-isers  that in t e  oozing season the service of mares should be post-poned till at ],t;5xst a s,0rrSh later than the normal date in order thatthe maree msjy    kop&quot;; t.t vorfc f-s long as possible.   It has also beensuggested/&apos;
   suggested  that stallion  owners should refrain  from  sending their   horses  to their districts till 1st May.      The District Agricultural Executive Committees  have &quot;been eir-   cularised  regarding this matter.7.  Supply of  Hay and Straw  for the Western Hi.ghl.ands and Islands      Feporte received  from the crofting districts of the vrest Highlands   show that  owing to the indifferent harvest  of  1917  there is at the   moment a serious shortage in the  supply of  fodder.   The Board have   been approached with  a view to supplies of  hay and  straw being secured   from other distriota  where a surplus exists.   Prom the information   before the Board it would seem that the scarcity is not oonfined to   the West Highlands.   The existing shortage in the  supply of oon-   oentratcd  feeding stuffs has caused farmers to retain for their own   stock a larger quantity  of hay and straw than  formerly and the great-   eet difficulty has therefore been experienced  in obtaining information   in regard  to farmers  who are really in a position to spare parts of thei   supplies.   Moreover, &amp;  considerable part of the normal surplus of   foddsr has already been purchased for Army  purposes and the Forage   Committee  of the Wejr  Offioe have  intimated  that none of the hav ac-   quired \y  them can he released to civilian  consumers.      Vith u view to ascertaining the exact position  the Board eir-   cularised  nearly the  whole of the Distriot  Agricultural Committees   in So ct land and in this  way information hao been received of several   lots of hay and straw whioh the owners ate  prepared to Sell.  Arrange-   menta arc  new being made fer the  transfer ef these  supplies to the   necessitous districts.                       /8&apos;  Corn Production Mt 1917  -  District T&amp;aes danoltteea      A sertifioate of  recognition  has been issued applicable to the   District &quot;Cages Committee for Dumfries and Galloway  district (Uo.8).1 Collection of gtatlsftfos  &amp; Returns relating  to  Agriculture   Returns under the Potatoes  (GrowsrcV B^urasA  Cft&amp;^c 1917      The tabulation  of the Returns for 1st February  has now been oom-   pletcd and a  summary  table  is appended showing the  results.
