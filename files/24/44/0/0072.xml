9Colonel Jones228C(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1s Government,)P&amp;^N       RECALL .IF CIVIL SERVANTS FRCM THE COLOURS,------* %--&apos;----1-  ,-,&quot;Y&apos;v ) -Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruetion.    -&apos; I should bemy Memorandum offrom the ColcursI then used.   Ihas only gone to                 glad if the War Cabinet would again consider                 November 19th on the Recall of Civil Servants                 (g.T, 2690)&quot;.   I will not repeat the arguments                 need only say that all my subsequent experience                 convince me that the question is becomingmore and more important every day,     I have had some correspondence with the Ministry ofNational Service and I understand that the Minister Is preparedto support the proposal that Civil Servants of approvedqualifications and experience now serving with the Coloursshould be recalled to their rivil work excluding for the timebeing men of Grade 1, Class.A who are under 3C years of age.     I am quite willing to accept this modification of myproposal and I think the decision of the Minister of National                upService to callall Civil Servants who have not attainedthe age cfa suitablein theArmy,.4 on January 1st, of this year, makes the presenttime to begin recalling the men who ore already     From the point of view of the general public this decisionby placing the Civil Servants in precisely ths same positionas other protected occupations would in my judgment undoubtedlyfacilitate the adoption of my proposals.     As regards the method of dealing with the men afterrelease, the Minister of National Service has suggested thatthe distribution should be carried out not by the Civil ServiceCommissioners as I suggested, but by a body in the nature of aPriority Board on which the Treasurys the Civil ServiceCommissloners, and the Ministries of National Service andReconstruction should be represented.     I agree with this suggestion and I should be glad if theWar Cabinet would authorise the other Ministers concerned andmyself to take the necessary action,CHRISTOPHER ADDIS ON    7th March 1918.
