8i     (1)   I wish to draw tlio attention of tho War Cabinet to thenecessity of arriving at an immediate decision as to the future ofbrewing,     (2)   On December 21st, 1917, tho War Cabinet decided to sanctionfor the quarter ending on the 31st instant tho 33-^ increase in thostandard barrelago of beer which had been permitted for the 1st quarterof 1917 (W.0.S04, Minute 9),  In the absence of any decision to thocontrary the permitted standard barrelage will revert on April 1stto the rate of 10,700,000 carrels per annum, plus JTavy and Armyrequirements,     (3)   As the War Cabinet will remember, the future of browing haslately been considered in connection with the restriction of imports. With a view to a saving of imports I submitted to tho Restriction ofImports Committee, in a Memorandum dated February 6th proposals for thesubstitution of solid glucose for barley and taking 250,000 quartersof barley from tho brewing trade for tho loaf,  ihe reduction in theQuantity cf barley meant a reduction of 1,050,000 standard barrels ofbeer.   In order to maintain the present bulk barrelage I proposed toenforce a General reduction in the gravity of beer.   This proposallas supported by the Restriction of Imports Committee,     (4)  At the time my opinion vies that the dilution involved in myproposal mentioned in the last paragraph represented all the saving  ,that could be reasonably effected by eliminating luxury beers whilemaintaining/
maintaining the production of yeast end avoiding a reductionin the present bulk &quot;barrolage, and I was opposed in presentcircumstances to any further reduction in the quantity or qualityof beer.  The Committee, however, recommended a further downwarddilution with a view to a saving of about 200,000 tons of freightper armum (G.194, Para. 13),     (5)  Having in view this decision and recognising the necessityof securing the greatest possible quantity of barley for use in theloaf, I arranged for the surrender of 500.000 quarters for thispurpose instead of the 250,000 previously suggested and I stoppedmalting as from the 1st instant.  The surrender of this quantityof barley represents 100,000 tons of freight which would have beenrequired had the barley not been surrendered for the leaf.  !7jJh.esurrender was possible only because the maltsters had made provisionfor brewing at the rate of 15,000,000 standard barrels.     (6)  In view of the surrender of this barley the maximum-standard barrclage that it will now bo possible to produce by meansof malt already manufactured and by the use of 112,000 tons ofsolid glucose is 12,590,000 standard barrels,   I am advised thatIf the War Cabinet are willing to face a drastic reduction in thegravity of beer and the consequent results on the interests ofhigh class brewers the present bulk barrleage of about 22^,000,000barrels per annum can still be produced.    To effect this theaverage gravity at which the statutory harrelage is brewed will haveIpftftto to be reduced to 1,C300 in Great Britain end 1.0450 in Ireland.where a higher average gravity is necessary in view of the greaterproportion of stout brewed thorot,   For the quarter ending
ending 31st December 1917, the average gravity was for Great Britainl,039o and for Ireland 1,0550,   These proposals mean a saving of200,000 tons of freight per annum.   (7)  The War Cabinet on consideration of the report of theRestriction of Imports Committee decided not to deal with therecommendation of the Committee in regard to downward dilutionpending the consideration of the question of the total prohibitionof brewing, which the Shipping Controller was bringing before theVar Cahinet separately at an early date. (W.C. 347, Minute 10).  Inview of this decision I have suspended action on my proposals fordownward dilution,   (8)  If, however, brewing is to be continued it is absolutelyessential that the brewers should be notified of any alteration inexisting conditions not later than the 16th instant so that they canmake the necessary adjustments and arrange for a new schedule ofdistribution to their customers.  As this requires at  least 7 to 10days on their part and several days will also be required by my staffin the drafting of any alterations, I shall be glad if the WarCabinet will come to a decision not later than the 9th instant.     With the materials which are now available only twoalternatives are open viz:-     (I)  To reduce the standard of gravity as suggested inParagraph 6 above and so maintain the present bulk barrelage.     (II)  To maintain the present gravity and consequantly reducethe present bulk barrelage by approximately 4,000,000 barrels per annum.     In my opinion It is essential to maintain the present quantityof beer and I ask for the ^ar Cabinet&apos;s authority to adopt the formeralternative.
