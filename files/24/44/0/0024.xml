gHBKBSBB(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government)IfMSiDRAKDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET.VEKEBEA1 DISEASE.        I have juat seefi the Kemorandum by Sir GeorgeCave with regard to the proposed V.D* Regulation underthe Defence of the Realm Act.   As Secretary of Statefor the Colonies I am of course not concerned with themerits of the measure or with the question of the pre-cise form which the proposed Regulation should take.What does concern me is that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere urged in the strongest possible terms by theDominion Premiers at the last Imperial War Conferenceto take immediate steps to remedy what is admittedlya -public scandal.        Speaking at the 12th Meeting of the Conferenceon the 24th April 1917 Sir Robert Borden said -     &quot;I do not think Canada will ever again send menoverseas to any war unless we are assured that suchconditions as have met our soldiers here will not meetthem again.   1 say unhesitatingly that if I shouldbe prime Minister of Canada on the outbreak of anotherwar I would not send one man overseas if the conditionswere such as have prevailed during the progress of thiswar.   It is a horrible outrage that they should be ex-posed as they have been&quot;;  and equally strong viewswere expressed by the other Premiers.        Since that time I have been repeatedly pressed.by the Dominion Governments on the subject and havebeen constantly asked what action has been taken.  To                                             theseJL
  these questions I  have  not been able  to  return any  satisfactory reply:   9  days  ago I  received an urgent  telegram from New  Zealand on the  subject asking for  an immediate answer,  but I have not been able to  make any reply pending  the issue  of the  Regulation  now in question-   In connection  with this subject  I would call attention  to the case repeated  in to-  day&apos; s paper of the Canadian  soldier tried for the  murder of a woman  who had communicated to him  venereal disease.   This is not an isolated instance  and unless some steps are immediately taken  to  remedy the present state of  affairs,  the feeling in  the Dominion,  which is  already angry, is likely to        most  become/gravely exasperated.          In conclusion,  I feel bound to point out  that the whole subject  was discussed  most carefully  by a Departmental  Conference at which all Departments  including the Home Office were present;  that the  Regulation to which Sir George Cave now  takes obj ec-:  tion was-agreed to unanimously at  that Conference;  and that it has been approved by  the  War Cabinet.  If further delay is permitted to  take place  in deal-  ing with the present scandal there is likely to be  very grave trouble with the Dominions and I  cannot  be responsible for the  consequences,  if  I should have  to meet the Imperial War Conference and  explain to  them that nothing  has been done because  the depart-  ment concerned objects  to carry out the  decision of  the War Cabinet.                                  W.H.L.COLONIAL OFFICE.                    6th Inarch,1918.
