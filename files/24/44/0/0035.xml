[This Bocument is the Property  of His  Britannic Majesty s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.1RT. 3S3$ )jj               MUNITIONS  PROGRAMME,  1919.  v^-^^^^t^^-         1. So far as munitions are concerned, the year 1918 is settled^^JSM^gJ^       for good or  for ill.   No decisive  changes  in  our modes of                       warfare can be produced in time to influence the campaign  now                       opening.  But it is imperative to  decide  quite soon what the                       character of the campaign of 1919 is to be.  It is no use consider -                       ing such a question  in October or November.  Practically a whole                       year&apos;s notice is required  for any great development in material.                       We ought to have made up our minds by the beginning of April                       what the main principles and general outlines of our munitions                       programme for 1919 are to be.  I would ask that this task may be                       undertaken at once.                           2. We  are  immediately confronted  with  the fundamental                       question &quot; How are  we going to win the war  in 1919?  &quot; It seems                       to  me a reasonable expectation if every effort is made, and unity                       prevails,  that by the end of this year  we shall have established                       three very substantial facts which are now disputed: (i) either the                       German will have attacked in the West and have been  repulsed, or                       he will have exposed himself incapable of delivering an offensive                       on a great scale; (ii)  the submarine warfare  will have entered                       upon a phase in which our tonnage will be greater at the end of                       every month, and not less as at present; (hi) the growing American                       army  will be becoming a real and great military factor.   It  is                       possible we may add a (iv) to this, viz., a definite and unmistak-                       able ascendancy in the air both as  regards numbers and quality.                       All these aims have, of course,  to be fought for and  worked for                       during the  ensuing months.  They  are reasonable  objects of                       endeavour.  Failure to attain  any of them would be disastrous, to                       us.  Our  success, on the other hand, in  attaining all of them will                       not necessarily be fatal to -the enemy.                           3.  (a.) We  must  further assume that a  new front will be                       made  against  the enemy in the East by Japanese armies being                       brought as deeply as possible into Russia, and by every conceivable                       inducement being offered to Japan to come directly into collision                       and contact with the German forces.  It will further be necessary                       to  stop the spread  of  German  influence towards India through                       Persia,  This can only be done by sending without delay sufficient                       troops to  dominate the Persian situation as was done by the Grand                       Duke in 1915 with such successful results.  (&amp;.)  We must assume                       that while Germany is absorbing and dragooning Russia, Great                       Britain will continue to break up and devour Turkey as an offset.                       albeit unequal,   (c.) We may balance the chances of  an internal                       collapse in Italy against those of an internal collapse in Austria,                       it being assumed, however, that we  shall do as much to hold Italy                       up to her task by the interpolation of trustworthy troops  in the                       Italian armies, and  by other forms of aid, as Germanv has done                       since the  beginning;  of the war,  is doing, and will continue to do,                       for her weaker allies.                           4.  All  these perilous matters being accomplished will bring                       us to the  campaign  of 1919,  and if we get so far the question                       repeats itself, &quot; How are we going to win then? &quot;  If. there is no                       method of winning  then which military men can discover, it will                       certainly be argued by many that it would be better to make peace                       at the least unfavourable moment in the present year,  abandoning                       altogether the hope  of a decisive victory in the war.  It therefore                                                                           B
becomes of the very highest consequence to discover  what is thebest plan for 1919, and whether there is any  plan or use we canmake  of our resources which will give us a reasonable hope of amilitary victory.    5. It  is clear that a military victory  (apart from internalcollapse)  can  only be  reached by offensive  action, and thatoffensive action can only be based on overwhelming superiority inone form or another.  Even if all the favourable assumptions madein the earlier paragraphs of this paper are borne out, it is  clearthat no overwhelming superiority wTill be available for us in severalof the main elements of war.  For instance, we cannot expect anysufficient  preponderance  in man-power  in  1919, even with theAmerican  armies,  to  enable  us to overwhelm by numbers theGerman front in the West.   The best it is reasonable to hope isthat the two  sides will be of about the same  relative strength asin 1917, before the Russian collapse.   Even  this is highly  dis-putable.   On the other hand, we  may fairly reckon on a  goodsuperiority in quality, which, added to the improvement in num-bers, will give us once again in the West undoubtedly  the strongerarmies. Still, the margin will not be enough to offer any prospectof a military victory by man-power.    6. There does  not either  seem to be any  good  prospect ofwinning a military victory through an overwhelming superiorityin guns and shells.  We are already at the limit of our shell pro-duction.  We cannot expect that the tonnage  of 1919 will, at thevery best,  do more than enable us, having regard to cur depletingstocks, to maintain our 1918 standards.   These give us no markedsuperiority over the enemy.  Further, the limits of what can beeffected by gun power have been coming very clearly into view.We see that after a certain point it tends to  defeat its own pur-poses as an offensive weapon, for the ground is so  ploughed up bythe necessary artillery preparation that it is impossible for troopsto advance over it.  It is a very practical and pregnant question atthe moment whether artillery has not been overdone, and whetherin the disposition of our resources for 1919  both personnel andmaterial should not be liberated from artillery for other forms ofwarfare.  I will return to this later.    7. Again, it is clear that our policy of blockade, on which theNavy have hitherto relied, can no longer be counted upon to pro-duce  decisive  results now that  the  Germans  have got enormousportions of Russia at their disposal.  Indeed, we are likely duringthe period under survey to suffer nearly as much inconvenience andpolitical instability through lack of supplies as are our enemies.    I therefore return to the fundamental question.  If you can-not starve out your enemy, if you cannot bear him clown by num-bers,  or blast him from  your path with artillery, how are yougoing to win?    8. I wish to avow, however, at this stage in the  argument, afirm conviction that the method  and the means do exist by whichin 1919 the German armies in the West could be decisively defeatedand their  front effectively broken up.  No proposition of this kindcan be stated in terms of certainty, because there are no certaintiesin war; but I believe that if the right decisions  are taken now, itshould be possible to impart to  the British armies in particular,and to the Allied armies in general, a means of continuous forwardprogression in  1919  which, if  successful, would yield  decisiveresults, and that the chances of success are good enough to justifythe prolongation of the struggle in the meanwhile.  I will pro-ceed  to indicate in general terms the lines of thought to whichattention should be directed in order to realise the result.
    9. Wars1 have hitherto  been conducted by infantry, cavalry,and artillery,  and these are  the three  recognised  arms of  theservice,  It has also  been observed, with some truth, that &quot; theinfantry is the army, and uses  the other arms as its adjuncts.&quot;Whichever way the question is  viewed, it  is clear that there are-no means of obtaining  an overwhelming superiority sufficient toenable a continuous advance to be made  by  any  developmentswhich it is in our  power to make in the  infantry,  cavalry, andartillery in 1919.  However, in the present war at least four newarms of the highest consequence have come into being, viz.:          Aeroplanes,         Tanks,         Gas,  and         Machine guns.    If we are to obtain the necessary superiority and the meansof effective, progression against the  enemy,  it can only be  bydevelopments  of a  far-reaching character  in  these  new methodsof warfare.    10. And let it here be  observed that every one  of these fournew arms has  already played or shown itself capable of playing adecisive part in the present war, in spite of the fact that they haveonly been tardily  and partially  and  doubtingly developed.  Forinstance,   it   is  the   machine  gun  which  has  made  thedefensive hitherto invincible.   Again, if  either side possessedthe power to  drop,  not five tons,  but  five  hundred tons  ofbombs each night on the cities and manufacturing establishmentsof its opponent, the result would be decisive.  If the  Germans hadused poison gas on a sufficiently large  scale the first time they usedit at all and before we were provided with effective masks., theycould undoubtedly have broken  up our whole front  in the  West.Similarly, if we had  developed tanks  in secret, or at any rate inmystery, till we had about 2,000, and then  had used  them as theywere  used at the battle of Cambrai, only on a much larger scaleand with carefully husbanded reserves of infantry to follow themup, we in turn might have broken up the German front and driventheir  armies into  a continuous  retreat.    We are clearly in thepresence of new factors, ail of which possess decisive  qualities.    11.  It must, however, be  remembered that the total quantityof our resources is limited,  and that the decision which has to betaken is one which involves the development  of these new arms,both in men and material, to a very large extent at the expense ofthe old.  Still, it is contended that this should be boldly faced, thatwe should create, in order to  attack the enemy in 1919, an armyessentially different in its  composition and methods  of warfarefrom any that have yet been employed on either side.  This  wouldonly be in accordance with the obvious principle that  if you cannotget a sufficient superiority over your opponent  in the  same methodsas he  employs, you should break away and develop  different andunexpected variants.  Thus we may contemplate (a) relieving thewant of man-power in the infantry, especially on defensive sectorsof the front, by great increases  of machine guns, automatic rifles,and the like; or (&amp;) putting most of the cavalry into tanks or othermechanical vehicles;  or (c) drawing  upon the artillery and thematerial which supplies it,  as far as may  be  needed^ to  raisechemical warfare  to its proper proportionate position  in  ourorganisation.   It  is unnecessary to sneak  of  the air, for  that isalready accepted.   We  have undoubtedlv the power at. the presenttime  of making such decisions  fullv  effective  for 1919 if we actwithout delay and upon a carefully  thought out and ruthlessly
 pursued plan.  The question is essentially one of proportion, but it is not capable of being  solved  unless  the  old proportions are definitely put aside and revolutionary changes in the composition of the armies and in their methods of&quot; warfare are unhesitatingly faced.     12.  On the other hand,  we need not exaggerate the extent of the  changes  which would be  necessary.   Let us  assume the figures are of  course  only tokens that at the present time our military  effort  in  men and material  combined is expressed as follows:          Infantry,  40 per cent.         Artillery, 40 per cent.         Air, 10 per cent.,          Cavalry, 3^- per cent.         Machine guns, 4 per cent.          Tanks,  2 per cent.          Gas, \ per cent.     The  kind of change that is suggested might be  expressed as follows:          Infantry, 35 per cent.         Artillery, 30 per cent.         Air, 15 per cent.         Cavalry, \ per cent.         Machine guns, 7 per cent.         Tanks,  8 per cent.         Gas, 4^ per cent.     This would give us an army substantially different in its composition from that of its opponents, and capable of confronting- him  with  offensive  propositions  fundamentally  different  in character from those which he has hitherto disposed of..     As stated above, the Air expansion is already practically con- ceded.  The development of machine guns and automatic rifles is also to a great extent assured;  bat  the two  most  vital of the new arms, namely,  tanks and ga.s, are  at present only  used  on  a miniature and experimental scale.     13. Yet  in  both of these  we  have  immense  advantages. inherent  or acquired, over the enemy.  Incomparably  the most effective method of discharging gas is1 by liberating it from cylinders to form a gas cloud when the wind is favourable.  In no otiier way can  results on the largest scale be achieved.   Although for some time we and the Germans have relied instead upon firing gas sheik from guns or mortars, there  is no doubt that the original method in spite of its difficulty and danger is by far the most formidable. It is undoubtedly possible if  the wind  is  favourable  to  dis- charge gas over a wide front  which will destroy life 15 or 20 miles behind the line,  and which,  if  the discharge is sufficiently  pro- longed or intense, will render all existing masks ineffectual.  The supreme fact is that the wind is at least six times, and  some say nine times, as favourable to us as it is to the enemy.  We are mad not to avail ourselves of this overwhelming advantage.  But with our  present pitifully  small gas service of perhaps 6,000 or 7,000 men we are only  trifling with the problem.     14. Again, take tanks.  Here our  advantage is  due to  our having started far in advance of the enemy and having with pain- ful slowness  but extreme thoroughness explored the difficulties, tactical and manufacturing, of this highly complicated arm.  The element of novelty has now  been  thrown  away,  but  numbers.quality, organisation, and training still  afford us opportunities of the first order if  we only had the wisdom and resolution to profitby them.  The year 1919 is still at our disposal. It is undoubtedly.
 within our power to construct in very large numbers armoured vehicles of various types, some to fight, some to pursue, some to cut wire and trample trenches, some to carry  forward men  or machine-gun parties, or artillery, or supplies, to such an extent and on  such a scale that 150,000 to 200,000 fighting men  can be carried  forward certainly and irresistibly on a broad front and to a depth of 8 or 10 miles in the course of a single day.  The resources are available,  the knowledge  is  available, the time is available, the result is certain: nothing is lacking except the will. We have never been able to get out of tire rut of traditional and conventional methods.   We have never  been  able to  plan on a sufficiently large scale, long in advance and with the necessary force and authority to. drive the policy through.  We have instead oniy carried out a series of costly experiments, each of which lias shown us the chance we have lost and exposed our thought to the enemy.     15.  It surely lies with  those who shake their heads to  say on what alternative method of attack or on what alternative form of superiority they can rely to win a military victory in 1919.  Where are they going  to get the numerical superiority which they had in the autumn of 1916 and the  spring of 1917, and which was then found not to be sufficient?  What more can artillery do in offence than it has  already done in the great battles of this year and last ? What grounds are there for  supposing that  we  possess  more staying  power  or  more national discipline  than the Germans? What more is to be looked for  from the blockade?  If there is  an alternative plan let us have it.  If not,  let this one have its fair chance!..  Let it be backed with as good an  effort as was given to the creation of the British artillery in 1915 and 1916.  Let.other interests be made to concede and conform to its essential require - merrts.  Surely we ought to have a plan for which we can strive? and not  simply go carrying on from  day to  day and from hand to mouth in the hopes of something turning up before we reach the final abyss of general anarchy  and world famine.    16.  There is a short way of ending this war; it is to defeat the German armies in the West.  For this purpose two conditions are necessary: first, we must have stronger and better armies our- selves; that  is the foundation on which everything rests, and there is no reason why we should not have it in 1919.   Secondly, we must  discover  a method of the  offensive  which enables  these stronger  armies to advance at a  certain moderate rate of pro- gression  along their selected strategical lines.   The  problem  is therefore definite and precise.   Indeed,  it is mainly mechanical. Discover a method by which a stronger army can regain its right-ful power of continuous advance, and  decisive victory is won.  It is mechanical methods which are preventing that advance.   Over- come  these by mechanical agency, and courage and quality will once again receive their due.                            III.    17.. There is one other aspect of  the  problem to  which  ireferred   in  my  paper  of  the  21st  October  last,   namely.the  scale and intensity of a  decisive  conflict.   War betweenequals in power  is   not  an   affair   which  can  be  carriedto  a  result  merely  by  quasi  business   and  administrativeprocesses  flowing smoothly out month  after  month  and yearafter  year.   It  should be a succession of climaxes on whicheverj^lring is staked,  towards   which  everything  tends,  andfrom  which permanent decisions are obtained.   These  climaxeshave usually been called battles.  A battle means that the wholeresources on either side that can  be brought to bear are during  the    [293]                           &apos;                  C
course of a single episode concentrated upon the enemy.  There hasnot been a battle in this war since the battle of the Marne of whiclithis could be said.  We in England particularly are misled by theincreasing scale of our casualties, due to the increasing size of ourarmies, into thinking that the intensity of the conflict is greaternow than in the opening stages  of the war.   The battle of theSomme in the period of its greatest fury involved no more than theengagement simultaneously of about  twenty British  and Frenchdivisions against probably half that number of Germans; and thebattle of Verdun ceased when the battle of the Somme had begun.All the great operations of 1916  and  1917, although so prolongedas to cause  very heavy losses.,  have involved  the simultaneousemployment only of comparatively  small forces  on comparativelysmall fronts.  The armies have been fighting in  instalments;  theyhave engaged perhaps 8 or 10 per cent, of their total strength.    18.  The  reasons which  have  led  to  this  are well known.The power of the defensive is  such  that  practically the wholespare artillery of  an  army has  to  be  collected  to  supporta  single  attack  in  which  there is  no  room  for  more  thana  tenth   of  the  available  troops.    There&apos;  has never  been,.and  there  will  never  be,  enough  artillery  to  enable,  say.six  battles  of  Messines   to   be   fought  at  one  and  thesame moment.  And thus the war in the West has dwindled dow?ito siege operations on a gigantic  scale which, however bloody andprolonged, cannot yield a decisive  result.    Thus, when a greatbattle is raging on the British front, six or eight British divisionsare  fighting desperately,  half-a-dozen others  are  waiting  tosustain them, the rest of the front is calm; twenty British divisionsare remaining quietly in their trenches doing their daily  routine.another twenty are training  behind the lines; 20,000 men are  atschool, 10,000 are playing football, 100,000 are on leave.  It is thesame with the enemy. Obviously we have passed out of the regionwhere the scale and intensity of the operations can be decisive onthe great armies which are in presence of each other. Still less canthey be decisive on the great belligerent  nations.   The idea  ofending the war by  &quot;killing Germans&apos;&apos;&apos; is a delusion.   You  havegot to kill or totally  incapacitate  at least 700,000 Germans  inevery year, i.e., a  number equal to the annual increment, before theslightest  progress is made towards  wearing down their manhood.And it takes at least one man&apos;s life  to kill a German.  We have tobe, in short,  merely exchanging lives, and exchanging lives upona scale at  once more frightful  than anything  that  has  beenwitnessed before  in  the  world,  and too  modest  to  produce adecision.    19.  Contrast this with the two first shocks of the war in theWest, namely, the first collision  on the frontiers or the supremestruggle at the Marne.  In the first three weeks of the war, betweenthe 20th August and the 10th or 12th September, the whole of theFrench and German armies,  every  division, every available man,were simultaneously, continuously, or repeatedly engaged in  openand moving warfare.   The battle of the Marne, for instance,  com-prised not only those operations near Paris of which we have read,but a general battle on a front beginning 50 kilometres west  ofParis right up to Verdun, and then  round the corner far downpast Nancy into Alsace, a total of certainly not less than 350  kilo-metres, along the whole of which the  armies were at death grips,hurling their last reserves at each  other.   The French, althoughultimately victorious, lost more men  in the first twenty  days offighting than in the whole of the year 1917.  The tempo of the warhas progressively languished.  It has steadily declined into a dead-lock more perilous and mere agonising, more disintegrating in itseffects upon the world, than any decision of armies, howeversharp.
    20. Until the arrival of the Americans in force, that is to say,during the whole of this year, we are not in a position, withoutrunning a desperate risk, to seek a general battle; but next year,in 1919, we may again be unmistakably superior in strength.  Itwill then be right to fight a battle; that is to say, to seek a militarydecision for which the whole strength of the armies is employed every man,  every gun,  every  resource within an   exceedinglylimited number of days.  But how?  By what means  can  we over-come the physical and mechanical difficulties that have  hithertoimposed such severe limitations upon our actions?  Possibly threetimes as many men as the enemy would be one way: we, shall neverhave them.  Three or four times as much artillery as we have atpresent might be another way: we shall never get it.  There onlyremain these novel methods, good in themselves, better still in com-bination with the older methods.  If on the British front we canonly afford the concentrated artillery necessary to sustain say twogreat simultaneous attacks, and the French an equal number, mustwe not look for substitutes which  will enable  other attacks, sup-ported only by the local artillery, to be delivered at the same time?Gas will certainly give you one of these.  Tanks, if we developthem, could give  us  at least two of the  highest order.   Possiblytrench mortars might offer another means.  If the French andAmerican armies folloAved similar methods, there is no reason whywe  should not once more see a general battle  on a 300-kilometrefront,  applying in its brief course  the whole strength of ourstronger attacking armies, and yet with each  attack supported bysome scientific method which overcame the wire and machine gunsof the  defence.    That would be  war proceeding by design through  crisis todecision not mere waste and slaughter sagging  slowly  down-wards into general collapse.                              WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.
