DOCUMElfT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS CrOVERIIMENiP           HOUSINGNote bjr the Minis-tor  of Roconstruotion...                                          t     I desire to  circulate for the information of mycolleagues a copy of  a letter-, which I have receivedfrom Lord Salisbury on the subject of Housing.   It will.be remembered that Lord Salisbury was Chairman of theAdvisory Housing  Panel p  the Reconstruction Committee.                                    C.ADDISON.                                       11th March 1917.
COPY OP LETTER FROM LORD SALISBURY TO PR.ADDISOH.26 th February 1918,Dear Addison,           The ffar Cabinet Office have &quot;been good enough to sendme Fisher *s- Housing sohoms and the successive Memorandaupon the question by the Ministers of the several Depart-ments concerned the last of which reached me this morning.I am very much obliged.   I do not know whether any furthercomment is expected on behalf or your Housing Panel hut Iwould make the following observations.           The Local Government Board scheme proposes a froefrant by the State of 75 per cent of tho loss and where it s required an additional grant up to the point which leavesa charge of not more than a penny in the   upon thedistrict.   The Housing Authority is to be the DistrictCouncil or the Borough Council as the case may be,   I amnot quite clear whether the schema is upon a voluntary orcompulsory basis.   Primarily no doubt the basis is volnnt-ary,- that is to say that the L.O.B. have every reason tothink that the Local Authorities will be willing to buildupon the foregoing terms to the extent of 150,000 houses inEngland and Wales,, that is up to 50 per cent of the estimateddeficiency.   Further they are taking power by a Bill now beforeParliament for County Councils to act in default of DistrictCouncils in respect of the remainder.   But at that point thereis a silence.   I do not know whether it is proposed to compelthe County Councils if they are also     in default.           This scheme is undoubtedly an improvement upon theoriginal suggestion of the L.G.B. because there is to be primafacie a fixed contribution by the State.   This contributionalso approaches in amoiuit nearly to the proposal of the Panel.The finance is not so simple as the finance jfn our proposaland simplicity is of importance where popular support it requi-site.   But undoubtedly there is a good deal to be said forleaving a charge of 25 p6r cent upon the Local Authoritybecause it will tend as the L.G.B. Memorandum indioates towardseconomy in the administration of the property as compared tothe possible working of our aoheme.           Beyond this the difference between the two schemeslies in the following points      1.   One to which I have already referred,- that theL.G.B. scheme is not a complete scheme.   It does not providefor 500,000 houses.   The other 150,000 houses must be builtsomehow and must be built on similar terms to the first150,000   Xt would be better to face that from the beginning.      2,   The Housing Authority is the District Councilinstead of the County Council.   For reasons which we havestated over and over again we believe that the CountyCouncil is a far somder authority.   It is both more public^spirited and more disinterested and it would work tc a
J237higher standard both of appearance and of efficiency     3,   There is no suggestion of any supervisory machinerybeyond what exists at present.   This would be qLulte inadequatefor 300,000 or even for 150,000 houses, so that in manycases these inferior Local Authorities would be free tobuild what houses they like where they like and to a largeextent tat l t them for what rent they like.  Consideringthat the taxpayer is to contribute at least three-quartersOf the loss and the whole of the capital that certainly  &apos;s&amp;emi to me a strong piropo&amp;al.   Fi3hor says in his liemo-rand\ i that in our scheme ihe number/sites and types ofhouses are to be finally Settled by the Central Authorityor its Commissioners.   It can be trtit in that way but I  do notthink it can be fairly so put.    ow far is it true to saythat the number character and site of Small Holdings are nowfixed by the Board of Agriculture?  It certainly is.not  trueat all, though it is true that the Board of Agriculture  throughits Coirrnls si oners has a supervisory authority which cfcligesa reluctant Coiuaty Council to do its work up to a certainstandard.   The proposals of the Panel were drawn upon themodel of these Small Holdings provisions and wore expresslydesigned to preserve within limits the free action of LocalAuthorities just as in practice it has been preserved in thecase of Small Holdings.  But, except by means of the ratherdiscredited method of byse-iaws, in their housing proposalsthe L.G.B. abandon all controlling authority by the Stateand secure no other return for the princely munificence  withwhich the taxpayer is to stand the racket.          I have nothing further to add except that Iam glad to see in some of the Memoranda suggestions forassistance to private enterprises   That matter was  not dealtwith in the Panel report partly because it was beingconsidered by another Committee and largely because ofits inherent difficulty.   But I agree that it ought tobe facod if a practicable scheme can bo found.   The Panellooked hopefully forward to the work of Public UtilitySocieties but something farther ought  if possible to bedone to help private enterprise directly,  though the diffi-culties are considerable,                           lours very  trvj,y,SALISBURY.
