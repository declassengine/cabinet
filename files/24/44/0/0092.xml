Colonel toss  &amp;IENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRlTOUaC di;Ji;STf&apos;S  JOV VS 1 C R E T.W A R   GAB X H IL (Reference j^g.38ffi sad 3891^Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil.-* *:* M* W4r C      I venture to express my entire concurrence with the noteof the General Staff/ dated 11th March,   (G*T.-J3891),      It is said that the policy there recommended should notbe carried out because of objections of a political  character.In the first place It is urged that to allow Japan to enterSiberia will mean the acquisition for that Power of  considerableterritories;  that ultimately ahe will or may  join hands withGerman expansion from the west, and that between them theywould dominate Asia.   The objection is often  p*it less defi-nitely than this, namely, that a great increase of Japanesepower in Siberia would be on general grounds objectionable.      It seems, however, doubtful whether the  Japanese willdesire great territorial expansion in that region^   They&quot;have shown no particular capacity for ruling other races,and no-one who is not obliged to would desire  to have oon-si&amp;ersble Slav populations under them.   A territorialempire in Siberia would not really increase but weaken thepower of Japan.   It would give her a great land frontierto defend with very little local population, and wouldtherefore involve an issaesse strain upon her man power.      X myself doubt whether Bhe will ever go  in for a greatcontinental empire, but if she does she is much more likelyto lock to China, where she would have a very  large  anddocile population with whom she has already many culturaland perhaps racial iies*    That Japan looks for considerablecommercial advantages In Siberia is more than  probable, butthese she will attain almost certainly whatever happens, andindeed by her last treaty with Russia she was  already givenconsiderable rights of this kind;  nor does there seem anyBritish interest which would b  directly injured by  a develop-nient of this kind, except on the principle that we wish topreserve all undeveloped countries for our own use,- aprinciple certainly not desirable as a guide to our  presentpolioys      finally It may be observed that expansion in  ^beria,even if it were territorial, would at any rate have  thegreat advantage of diverting Javanese attention from theSouthern Pacific and from India, where she is  likely in thefuture to be much more dangerous to British interests^      The second great politioal i;rgument against Japaneseintervention is that it would antagonise Russia.  That itwould antagonise certain of the Bolshevist leaders inPetrograd and Moscow I do not doubt, but I do not in theleast believe that it would have any such effect on  thegreat masses of the Russian peoples *   The Russians areEastern and not Uesteru in their modes of thought.   Russiaalready contains the most diverse races,   Turks, Mongols,Chinese, Georgians, Armenians, cr,d so on.  I have never
&quot;* 2 *heard of any racial feelings existing between  these com-penents of Russia.   On the contrary, men drav;n from allof them have been freely utilised in high administrativepositions.   One of their groat Generals came  from Turkestan,Many of the revolutionary leaders were Georgians, and I doubtnot other instances of the same kind could easily be given.Eor has there eveg been any groat bitterness left by the Russo-Japanese war.   Had a Ftestern nation engaged in warfare with ayellow race, and had been forced to code to it large portionsof the national possessions, it would have boon felt by &quot;westernminds as an intolerable disgrace, but I am not aware that anysuch feeling exists amongst the Russian populations.  Phrasessuch as &quot;letting loose Asia on Russia&quot; are&quot;really completelybeside the point.  Hot only in actual territorial extent, butin sympathy, in race. In culture, Russia, is,.far more Asian thanEuropean.      If the Japanese invade Russia and ill-treat its peopleor annexe large parts of its territory, that indeed mightleave bitterness behind it, but I see no reason to think thatthat is likely to happen,  Japanese troops havo always behavedwell in warfare, and when the ^oint expedition went to Pekinthe Japanese contingent gave an example to tho Germans, theFrench, the Italians * and even I believe to the British, whichmight have been followed with great advantage  to the Chinese.Kor is there any ground for thinking that Japanese foreignpolicy is treacherous.  On the contrary, she has always carriedout to the letter any engagement which she has entered into.Beyond the letter indeed she does not think herself bound to gobut I believe that it is an entire mistake to think that in herforeign relations she is untrustworthy,      Kven if che political objections alluded to above werethought stronger than I can think them, it seems thatJapanese intervention is the only real safeguard against theeventual Germanisation of the whole of Russia,  X cannot doubtthat, whether the Bolshevists be honest or dishonest, they aretotally incapable and inept.  At the best they are meredreamers,   At the worst they are scheming either for Germanor for Cssaristic interests,   As long as they are nominallyin power anarchy must continue to grow until it is intolerable,and I see no native force likely to be created which will over-come it.   We did our best, knowing indeed that the chance ofsuccess was extremely remote, to galvanise into life thevarious efforts in the south and east of Russia to reform her-self from within, but the Bolshevist poison hAs been&quot;too strongfor us, and e&amp;ch and all of them have come to grief, leaving thfield open for German or Turkish advance.    Indeed, theBolshevists have only shown energy in comoating those elementsof the population that were anti-German,   To me it seems thatif we leave our interests to defence by the Bolshevists Germandomination in Russia in some form or another is absolutelycertain,   As it is, they will get from the south some grain,muoh oil, all the man&amp;anese they want.   If they dominateSiberia and the UralgTalso, they will get hutter, cotton,linseed, platinum, copper, wool and raeat*   .&apos;.,part from thesethings, stores are scattered through the country, of whichthe great example is the enormous accumulation at Vladivostok,      ,,or do I see why they should not ultimately obtain agreat increase of man power, and if that happened have wc-any ri^ght to assume that our Japanese Allies, having beenprevented from taking in time the only effective measure forthe defence of Allied&apos; interests, would continue to support
- 3 -a cause which would seem to them doomed to disastrousdefeat?      I venture therefore to urge upon ray colleagues thenecessity for carrying out the policy approved at leasttwice by the Cabinet of encouraging Japanese intervention.If that policy is the policy of the Government, and is to becarried to a successful issue, It must be pressed by everymeans in^pur power, both at Tokio snd at Washington, and r,emust notpielay or hesitation give the impression to theJapanese and Americans that we are only half-hearted in ourproposals.
