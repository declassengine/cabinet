It had been  inferred              from  your tel&amp;gram of 11th  January last ysax that              Importance was attached.in Australia in view of              profit sharing arrangement to any wool so reXaasad              being sold to best  advantage and this infej^ase confirmed              by remark0.:a8 to anticipated profits in your  tale gram              15th  D member last  year as to insurance,   alo by              auction secured  this result and it hid therefore  not              been  expected that  embarrassment would be caused by              adoption of this procedure,   Beco&amp;niae that  it  is of              first importance to avoid trouble  of nature  indicated              in your telegram and I shall therefore be glad to have              as  soon m possible for  future guidance full infcraa-              tion  a&amp; to situation and dangers to be guardedagainst.              far Office earnestly hope that -situation will permit  of                                                        iaimediat a
inimmediate decision in favour of proposals my telegram21st February both as to the 200,000 bales merino andas to the additional 150,000 bales.   As to the 200,000bales they represent that matter is  most urgent assome of the wool has already arrived and more is onits way and United States Government are pressingfor answer.  War Office state that United StatesGovernment will be much inconvenienced by anyrestriction upon method of disposal  of the 200,000bales that apparently their intention is  to sellpart by auction but that they wish  to shape theirarrangemente according to circumstances.  It must beborne :ln mind that high prices realised Boston  sal adue largely to limited freight available for bringingwool to consuming maxScets and that freight for woolso sold was provided by iritish Government atconsiderable inconvenience.  Freight for the 200,000bales has to m found by United States Government andsame arrangement contemplated for additional 150,000bales,       L0&quot;G.
