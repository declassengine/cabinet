The usual conditions undor which (in the absence of a re-convict ion) a lioenoe is revoked do  not exist in Maclean1s case, though the general power to revoke exists.     From the point of view of law and order, there can bo no doubt that Maclean&apos;5 present immunity tends  to bring the law into contempt.

ANNEX I.

RECENT REVOLUTIONARY AGITATION IN GLASGOW AND CLYDESIDE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO PROSECUTIONS UNDER D.R.R. AND MACLEAN&apos;S LICENCE.

(Memorandum by the Lord Advocate)

1. During the autumn of 1917 and the winter of 1917-18, I have seen reports of many speeches delivered in the above area and and also (quite recently)in the mining districts of Lanarkshire and Fifeshire. Those reports crime to my notice as containing possible matter for prosecution under D.R.R.

2. There has for long been a small but active group of extreme revolutionary socialists in Glasgow. It is anti-national, anti-militarist, anti-oonscriptionist. It preaches class war, and tells the wage-earning proletariat that it is the tool and the dupe of a capitalistic and employing bourgeoisie in every international conflict (including the present war) in which this country engages.

3. Since 1915, this group has allied itself with each successive element of industrial unrest which has assorted itself under war conditions.

4. In connection with the "dilution" process carried out in 1916, several members of the group were deported from the Glasgow and Clydeside area, and others were successfully prosecuted under D.R.R. But all of these had returned to Glasgow or the neighbourhood by the summer of 1917 - one of the convicted (John Maclean) on license. Since their return, they have engaged, more or less, in the same kind of agitation as that in which (in 1916) they were  led to infringe D.R.R.

5.  The line  which divides socialist propaganda of the revolutionary type above described from attempts to "impede recruiting", or to "impair the discipline of H.M.Forces", or to "create disaffection among H.M.subjects", or to "prejudice public safety and the Defence of the Realm", is a thin one in the circumstances of the times (and the group is not without skill in playing close to the line without definitely crossing it). It was not until the disputes about the 12\\1//2 increase in wages, and the Man-Power proposals of the Government began to form the subject of violent passages (suggesting extreme and even forcible action) in the speeches delivered by Members of the group (McManus, Gallacher,  Maclean, McDougall, and others) that these speeches appeared to me worthy of consideration with a view to prosecution under D.R.R.

At this stage, the Minister of National Service visited Glasgow. Two of the worst offenders (McManus and Gallacher) moved,  seconded and carried a resolution against the Minister&apos;s proposals at an open meeting which the Minister himself addressed. The speeches were minatory in tone, and (though not themselves prosecutable) they ?heed those features in ether speeches delivered by them and their associates about this time which, in my opinion, did come within D.R.R. I considered that this incident made say attempt to make these speeches the subject of prosecution inexpedient for the time being.

A new factor emerged shortly afterwards, in the shape of threatened food shortage.  Like other elements of industrial unrest, it was seized on by the group, with  very ?arked effect, as fresh material for agitation, and some speeches were  made, especially  by
Maclean, which were breaches of D.R.R. Meanwhile, however, Maclean had become Russian Consul for the Bolsheviks, and several Russians, notably one, Shammas by name, appeared as participator in the agitation. This put a new complication in the way of immediate action against Maclean, and the situation was brought before the Secretary for Scotland at a conference between him, and a representative of Scottish Headquarters, and myself at the end of last month.

8. Public opinion in Glasgow and Clydeside has now manifested itself in a sense generally adverse to the agitation recently conducted by the group, and the agitation itself has for the time being tied down.  Subject, however, to the questions of policy which Maclean&apos;s Consulship, and the nationality of Shammas introduce into the consideration of taking procedings against them (questions which reflect also upon the propriety of immediate proceedings against their friends) I should feel myself bound to proceed, in any good case where satisfactory evidence was available, against Maclean or any other member of the group.

Sir,      I have  the  honour to draw your attention to the following facts  :* 1*     During  the  recent  Industrial unrest on the Clyde and in the Munition  Ar$a  of Glasgow my attention has boon continually drawn to the Revolutionary influences  at work in those districts.       Daring  tho  past few souths,  both in the Industrial Area of the Olydo and in the Coed  Fields of Lanarkshire and Fifeshire, an increasing  number  of Meetings have  boon hold.   The tone of tho speeches delivered at  these Meetings has gradually increased in virulenee,  and  some  of  the so speeches are now of a definitely revolutionary  character.    The  class of man who in particularly identified with  this  form  of  propaganda includes some of the men who wore deported  from tho  Hanitione Area of the Clyde in 1916 and others vno suffered imprisonment for their share in the agitation of that  time.    In  the former category there areArthur Ualianua and David Kirkwood;  in  the latter caterrcry there are John MoLe&amp;n,  J.DsMcDougall,  James Maxton and tf.R. OalX&amp;eher.   Of  all these  2&amp;Lean and McDougall are by far themost notorious.       It will be  remembered that  the  deportees Mcltaus andKir&amp;wood wore  allowed  to return to  Glasgow in May,  1917.   McLeanwas released on  licence in  June  1917.    MoBougall,  Iteton and Gallachor were released on  the  expiration of their terms  of imprisonment.       On their  return  to  Glasgow  these  men at first  tooklittle active part in  seditionary  propaganda but they havegradually increased their activities.    HcLean,  HoDougall,Kirkwood,  i&amp;i,tanus and  Gall ache r have boon particularly notiooable in their opposition to  the  recent  Man-Power Legislation of theGovo rnmcnt.                                 P     Attached are Police Reports  of speeches made  atMeetings at v/hich the  following men  took part                      HeLean,                      HcPcugall,                      Maxton,                      ICirliwood,                       111 &quot;                       Shaarjnas.
m     From these ep&quot;jeches it 7.111 &quot;be seen that the tone nowresorted to exceeds all limits of reasonable political criticismand that they arc made with the clear intention of inspiringmistrust of the Government and in some casea provoking to actsof violence.  Many of the statements made in these speechesare in direct contravention of the Defence of the RealmRegulations *     It will be seen that among these agitators the mostvirulent and noticeable are John McLean and J.D. i.cDougall.     John koLean is a man of considerable influence among themalcontent population of Glasgow, and has an influence in themining districts of Lanarkshire and Fifeshire, and is believedto be well known in England.  He has recently become appointedConsul General in Glasgow for the Russian Revolutionary GovermerJand has opened a Consulate Office at 12, South Portland Street,Glasgow.  This has given him an increased importrjice among the  jRevolutionary section in  Slasgew, and, assisted by a Russian   [Alien named Sheaaace as his Secretary, he utilises this new      ifound position to expound to his hearers his Bolshevik ideas.   [     Jamee MoDougail wields a very considerable influence among jthe disaffected persons in tho Lanarkshire 0e&amp;3, Fields,         j     Of the other offenders James Maxien, W.B. Gallaoher andArthur Hckanus have been mere careful to avoid the technicalbreaking of the law and have confined themselves  more closelyto Industrial questions.     Similarly as regards David Kirkwood, but his speeches attimes have been violent as will be seen from the attached Report!     There is in Glasgow a group of Russian Aliens of which theleader and most notorious is the above mentioned Lewis Shammas, Iparticularly since he has identified himself with the activities!of John McLean.  It will be seen from the Reports that he is alslguilty of inflammatory utterances.                              I     During the l&amp;st six months X have been watching carefullythe effect and degree of seriousness of this movement,  ivring  Ithe summer of 1917 the speeches were fairly  mild and mightlegitimately be classified as somewhat harmless,  I refrainedfrom taking action against these speakers beeaust I did notdesire b  means of prosecution to obtain for them a more preminelposition before the public *     The Speeches have, however, gradually become of a verydifferont type, partly, I think due to immunity from prosecutioniand partly also due to the Revolutionary movement reflectedfrom Russia.  The speeches have, however, now attained a degree Iof virulence which I em of opinion calls for action.     With this end in view I recently addressed n latter to the ISecretary for Scotland in regard to John McLean and Lewis ShemmJthe former being a oonvioted person released on licence,  while  fthe latter is a Russian Alien,     As a result of my letter to the Secretary for Scotland &amp;Conference took place at which the Secretary for Scotland,  the  ]Lord AdvooAte,  the permanent Under Secretary for Scotland andmy Chief General Staff Officer attended.
          At  the  Conference  the Lord Advocate  stated his opinionP    that  some  of McLeanVs utterances were breaches of the Iaw*     The Secretary  for  Scotland, however, considered that befara     taking such  proceedings,  in view of  the present labour  ean^lio-     ations and of  the  International situation,  that he should appri-s-e-     the War  Cabinet  and  the Foreign Secretary  of  the position; he     added that he  had  already made a communication to the Prime     Minister on  the  subject - &quot;I share  this view and realise that     there may  be considerations of policy known to Hi3 Majeetyfs     Government of  which  I  am  not  aware.          Having, however, watched the  growth  of this movement, I     consider it  my duty  to  bring  the whole matter to the knowledge     of the Government  and,  were it not fot the considerations to     which I  refer,  I should recommend  that proceedings be taken     against  the  following persons:-JOHN McLSAN   Either by means of cancellation ofhT&amp;TTITSnTc or by prosecution.  Of the two methodsI favour the latter so that it cannot be said thata man is victimised without trial, as was saidin the case of the Clyde Deportees in 1916.JAM^S MoDOUGALL*  By prosecution.LEWIS 8HAMMAS.  .  By deportation.                                    VI have the honour to be,          Sir,   Your obedient Servant^       (Sgd)  J.S. SWART.
