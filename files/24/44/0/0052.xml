Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.C. 21.MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATION IN FINLAND.General  Situation.     Since last report events have moved with startling rapidityin Finland.    On February 21 four vessels were reportod to havearrived at Vasa with rifles, guns and ammunition for the Finnishjagers and German volunteers serving with General Mannerheiir^sforces.   A marked coolness also became noticeable between theFinnish Red Guards and the Russian Bflshevik soldiers, whichresulted in the latter adopting first a position of neutrality;later under the influence of the approach of the Germans, andthe terms of Article 4 of the Rueso-Germon Peace which stipulatesthat all Russian troops are to be evacuated frem Finland, theRussian forces there have been gradually melting away, so ensuringthe ultimate victory of the white Guards.  Meanwhile the ecenpmiccondition of the country remains very bad, and food stuffs are atfamine prices.     while the Swedish Government definitely declined theinvitation of the Finnish Bourgeois Government te intervene inIts interests and render assistance against the Red Guards andRussian Bolsheviks, it acted in answer to a petition from theAland Islanders.   A small expedition accompanied by men of warwas despatched which acted In concert with Finnish White Guardswho had crossed over on the ice in demanding the evacuation of theIslands by the Russian troops and their direct transference toReval,  Everything seemed to be developing favourably, when .Germany announced that In response to on invitation from theFinnish Government, she intended giving military assistance insuppressing  the  revolt  in Finland and would  temporarily occupy
the Aland Islands as a base of operations.  The circumstancessurrounding this invitation are not clrar, and apparently therehas been considerable division of opinion amongst the BourgeoisGovernment itself.  But the facts remain that already the Germansare organising a commercial and economic campaign in Binland,whilst an effusive Address of Thanks was transmitted to the GermanGovernment by the Finnish Government on February 26th in connectionwith the services rendered by it in granting facilities for thetraining of the Finnish volunteer corps3 in which the expectationwas expressed that the German Emperor &quot;as the most powerfulprotector of Germanic culture and the evangelical faith willsafeguard the striving of the Finnish people towards liberty&quot;.It is also stated in the Politiken (Stockholm) of March 2nd thatshortly after the declaration Of Finnish independence, a Finnishdelegation left for Berlin in order to induce Germany to occupythe Aland Islands immediately.Views of Member of Finnish Delegation on the above.     The writer has had a further opportunity of discussingthe present situation with the Youag Finnish Delegate some of whoseforecasts, as reported in former Memoranda, have proved so accurate.The first point taken up with him was the probable reasons&apos;forthe present non-iaterferenoe of Sweden in Finnish affairs.This he attributed in the first instance to deliberate fear ^finfection of the Swedish troops by Bolshevist ideas;  a second-ground for non-interference was found in that general considerationthat the Majority parties (Liberals and Social Democrats) inthe Riksdag who support the present Government have always beenin favour of neutrality, and strongly objected to the pro-Germanviews prevalent amongst the Conservatives at an earlier stage of
the war.  He regretted that the Swedes had not interfered, sincethe Finnish people would then have realised that the Swedeswere ready to do something for the Finns, who have alwaysregarded themselves as the natural protection sf the Scandinaviancountries against the Russian^ yet had again in this war beenleft quite alone to deal with the Russians.   He felt thatthrough co-operation between the ruling classes in Finland andSweden, the future of the entente between the Northern countriescould have been based on mutual assistance against the Russiansduring the most critical period for tho independence of Finland,whereas the present refusal of Sweden to help them had compelledeven those Finns who were afraid of German influence to acquiescein the necessity of getting at least some foreign help against theBolsheviks, and as no other help could be obtained, Germanassistance was accepted.   This, however, would simply strengthenreaction all over the Baltic shores.   Further, as the result ofthis German intervention, tho Finnish bourgeois classes wouldnecessarily, to a certain extent at any rate, feel themselvesindebted to the Germans for the strong support given by themagainst anarchy.   On the other hand, it was probable that theGerman landing in Finland might create in Sweden a stronger prq-Ally sentiment than ever before.    He further considered it verynecessary that Great Britain, France and the United States shouldgive earnest attention to the present situation in Finland and theBaltic Provinces for the following reason.  The enthusiasmprevalent at Xthe moment in Finnish bourgeois circles wouldgradually disappear as the result of German interference,particularly as soon as the German egotism began to make itselffelt.   The sooner the Allies could send able mon to Finland inorder to show the Finns that they have the-moral^jjupport of
the Allies,  without endangering the political and ecsnsmic freedomof Finland in the same way as the Germans are aiming at doing,the greater  would he the importance not merely from the Finnishpoint of view but also from that of the Allies themselves.  Inthat way the Allies would help the Finns and at the same timewould create a good impression in Scandinavian countries.Norway and Sweden have just made agreements with the Allies inregard to shipping and other commercial relations.     With regard to the address to the German Chancellor from theFinnish Senate, he considered that it was most probably the workof the acting President of the Government Mr Renvall, who belongedto the Young Finnish party, and Mr Sario.  Formerly Mr Renvallwas a member of the Diet and a leader in it, but his tec Con-servative principles and inertia caused his exclusion from theparty and membership in the Diet.   He lived in private untilduring the war when he succeeded in winning the confidence of theextreme pro-Germans;  on that account Mr Svlnhufvud, the Presidentof the Government, accepted him as one of his Ministers in thepresent Government, which was an attempt to unite all thedifferent bourgeois parties.   Mr Sario, the present ForeignKinister, is one of the most active pro-Germans in the Old Finnishparty,   When the pro-Germans in Finland organised themselvesin the beginning of the war, he was sent as an Old Finnishrepresentative to S^ckholm in 1916, as Charge in connectionwith the Finnish volunteer force in Germany.  There he lived forseveral months and was subsequently sent to Berlin to representthe Finnish pro-Germans, and also to look directly after theFinnish volunteers in Germany.  In 1917 he published a bock inGerman Die Hordische Brupke, in which he explained the importanceof Finland frsm the strategical^e-conomio ^d^ulturaX-^oint of
  view,  and strongly recommended for Finland a pro-German orientation.  In the end of 1917 after the proclamation of Finnish Independence  he was chosn by Mr Svinhufvud to  be one of the Finnish delegates  to the Central Powers owing to his close connections with the  German authorities.  In that capacity he made a statement to the  yossische Zeltung in Berlin to the effect that close economic and  cultural bonds must be established between the new Republic and the  German Empire.  At the same time  he published a new pamphlet -  Die Nordisohen Dardanellen - in which he pointed out that even  after  the war the economic competition between Great Britain and  Germany would go on, aid that Finland should join German supremacy  in the Baltic as directed against British commercial interests.  In the Address the Germans are thanked for permitting the Finnish  volunteers to have their military education in Germany and  gratitude is expressed that Russia has been completely defeated.  The expectation that the German Emperor would support the Finnish  troops against the Russians was to be understood in the opinion  of the Delegate frcm the point of view of the express necessity of  getting rid of the last remnants  of Russian rule in Finland, viz.  the Bolshevik troops.   The reference to the German Emperor as  &quot;the most powerful protector of German culture and the evangelical  faith&quot; found its explanation in the fact that Mr Renvall is the  son of a former Archbishop, and has the reputation of being a very  religious man.       The delegate concluded by saying that when Mr Svinhufvri  made his last speech in the Diet in the middle of January, after  the reccgnition of Finnish Independence by France, Germany and  the Scandinavian countries, he paid his chief tribute to France,  as also did Mr Lundson, the Speaker of the Diet, though he isf supposed to be a pro-German.  &quot;This shows, I think, that the Diet
  s pursuing a policy of  most striot neutrality, whereas the pro-Germans in the Government,  Mr Renvall and Mr Sario, have newavailed themselves  of the absence of the Diet to pay theirpersonal tribute to the Germans.    I have also seen in the Britishnewspapers the statement  that amongst the members of the Governmentdissension prevails with  regard to German armed intervention.This is the more conspicuous  as General Mannerheim seems to objectto German intervention:   he expected only arms and munitions,not troops&quot;.8.3.18.ft
