                           WAR CABIl&amp;iT. Igj C R 22 T .                     American Shipbuilding:.^ 56(39.  &apos;           Memorandum by the. Rtifii Hon. G-t 1?, Barnes,, H.P.           I  have received a letter from the Secretary to the      Labour  Delegation, which is hoy; visiting ^erica, and I      think it throws some light on the reason for the disap-      pointing results of American shipbuilding, which are set      forth in the paper issued by the Shipping Controller.      (G.T,  3825),     The letter itself is long, and I do not think mycolleagues would care to read it in its entirety;  butthe following gives the most important information containedin it -           &quot;We were amazed  to  find  that  thoy are  trying to     build  ships on time work,   with  the  exception  of  the     yards  on the Delaware  river and  at Philadelphia,  all     shipbuilding is done  on  time.  \7g  are  going to explain     to the workman the splendid results  which have accrued     to hi si British contemporary,  by  the  adoption of a     system of payment by  results;  but above  and beyond     all, we will dwell on  the necessity  of keeping the peace     and having all grievances referred to  a State-appointed     State-paid, and representative tribunal&quot;.It would appear from the above that an American  workingman who is  employed on shipbuilding in yards other  than thoseon the Delaware River and  at  Philadelphia,  has no immediateincentive to put his back  into his work.     The Labour Delegation  are circulating  copies of theTreasury Agreement, the main  provision of which  is  that theGovernment undertake not to reduce piece-rates so long aswar time conditions obtain;   arid they are also circulatinginformation regarding the  Committee on Production - thenational safety-valve which conies  into operation  when  disputesarise affecting munition.trades.     But I  think that representations should be made to LordReading, so that American  shipbuilding employers  and employedmay be fully informed of what has  been done here  to expediteoutput by dilution, payment by results and  arbitration, sothat he may assist as opportunity  offers.                                    (SGD) G.N.B.2, Whitehall Gardens,       S..W.1.   11th. March, 1918.
