Sir,

I have to enclose copy of a Resolution handed to me by the Chairman of the Tramway Employers and the Secretary of the National Transport Workers Federation.

I may add that it is extremely expedient that instructions should be given for early action with reference to maximum tolls and charges, as the Provincial Tramway and Bus services may otherwise be in very grave difficulty.

Arbitration was brought about to-day after conferences extending the whole of Yesterday. A copy of this communication has been sent to Mr. Barnes, and to Sir Albert Stanley.

I am

Sir.

Your obedient Servant,

(Sgd) G.R., ?ITH.

RESOLUTION H? TO ? ?.
