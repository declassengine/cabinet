Despatched 27th February,  1918. Rcceived 28th February,1918.     Arrangements have been made to sow in Thessaly during March30,000 hectares of fodder crops (millet or sorgho) with a view toaugmenting the national production to cope with the needs of ourmobilised army and eventually contribute to the feeding of thehorses of the Allied armies at Salonika.  The 1200 tons ofnecessary seed were being bought at Alexandria, where, accordingto our information, ample quantities exist.  Refusal to exportby the Egyptian Government,  in spite of the intervention of theBritish Legation in Athens,  makes it impossible for us to pro-duce these crops which wc had estimated would ^-:ive us at least60,000 tons of fodd*er in June next, and from which all the Allieswould have benefited.     I should be obliged if you coulu get the E.-ryptian Governmentto reconsider their decision, and to authorise export, as sowingmust take place within a month.

Dear Mr. Lloyd George,              I have the honour to transmit herewith an urgent    telegram received,  only late yesterday, from M.

Yours sincerely,                                      (Signed)  J. GEKXABIUS..e Right Honourable,  D.

II. (Contd.)For Mr. Lloyd George.    In regard  to the  tonnage  at  the  dis-posal of C-rosce  the  Inter-Allied Committee  in  Athens hasadmitted, with reference to  the tonnage at  the disposal  ofGreece, that it  is inadequate  and  has expressed its  officialopinion on the subject.   Yet  not  only has  our tonnage notbeen increased,  but  not  even one of the torpedoed vessels  beenreplaced.   The  follovdng vessels  representing 13,000 tons,that is to say a quarter of  the total caigt-- capacity at  ourdisposal has been torpedoed;   The  &quot;Till&apos;1  end of December,  the&quot;Janinna&quot; also end of December, and the &apos;-&apos;Char i ton&quot; on Februarythe 5th.   Uot one of these  has been effectively replaced.The     Veniselos&quot; was conceded to us to  replace the ,TIili&quot;subject to the consent of the  French Government but  they haveinformed us that the &quot;3. Veni^los&quot; being chartered  by them isnot available.   I draw  your attention to the  above  factsbegging you to give  directions for the effective replacementof the lost vessels *   It is a painful matter  to  have to laystress on the fact that, whilst deaths from famine are beingreported from various parts  of Greece due to tardiness anddefaults on the  pert of  the  Entente Committee  entrusted  withthe apportionment of tonnage,  our  demands for  the assuranceof transport for food should remain unsatisfied.   If thisstate of affairs is  to continue nil the great  efforts Greeceis making to offer her military assistance  to  the Allieswill have been made  in vain,   Ag  a matter  of  fact our needof transport&apos; is  constantly increasing whilst the  resourcesleft at our disposal are as  steadily decreasing.     In taking the liberty of  drawing your  attention to  theabovo mentioned  questions, a prompt solution of -rhich I  hope-folly ar/ait..-   I beg of  you  to be  kind enough  to  issue thenecessary instructions for the grant to us  of  the supple-mentary tonna&amp;e  r/hich the Inter--illled Committee  in  Athenshas admitted to  be requisite, * aid which is  absolutelyindispensable for the pressing needs of the  Country.   Thislast mentioned tonnage is additional to that for  which I havemade the foregoing urgent appeal,                          (Signed)   VBNIZ3L0S.Whitehall Gardens, 3.77.   March 6tb, 1916.
