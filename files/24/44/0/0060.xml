WEBZZIY  HSXlRT  Oil  ITALY,  XXIX.                          (Kerch, 7th, 1918)   The very enthusiastic reception given in the Chamber to 3onnino&apos;sspeech of Jeb.  83rd ,:.nd those of Orlando of Feb. lEth and 23rd &quot;&apos;Ouldseem to have hf en the result not of any particularly reassufcingrevelations sr definite declarations in regard to policy - forneither Mi^istbr committed himself to anything of the sert - butrather to the serious anoreeiation of the gravity of Italy1s positionrevealed in&apos;their language,  ton&apos;e and manner of delivery, and to the iiiKprossipn    strength combined with moderation orsduoed hy them at amoment when strong and determined hut impartial government is whatevery sane Italian is longing for.   &apos;7e noticed in our Henori of Feb. 22nd the fact th&amp;t the Presidentof Council had expressed sympathy with the cause of the oppressednationalities of * us t r i a- Hung a r y.   It may be worth while to give thefull text of the passage.   Ifter re-affirming that Italy&apos;s maximumand minimum war-aims consisted in  (1) accomplishment of national unityand (2) security of frontiers both on land and sea, and that the course.of the war itself had shown how  closely interdependent and how indis-oensahle to Italy&apos;s existence these aime v^ere, the speaker continued;-        &quot;Nothing therefore is more painful to us than tr: suspicion,     unjust as it is harmful to  us and to others, that our     war-aims&apos; are determined not only by ineluctable life and death-     issues but also by imnerialist hankerings after domination and     opnresoion of other races.   On the contrary - I here proclaim     in the presence of Parliament that no one in the world can     possibly regard with greater  sympathy than ourselves the asoira-     tions cf the various nationalities.    (Loud apnlause accompanied     by cries from Socialist benches &quot;We are bound by the Treaty of     London.  We want to see the Treaty.  It is time to have finished     with it&quot;).  And their eauae,  if it meets with wide-spread moral     support -and arouses deserved  interest in every-civilised and free     country, finds in Italy, thanks to our Gomrnra historical fellow-     ship in sorrows and hopes,  hearts equally warm and sympathetic
   in this  Italy,  where to an objective sense of justice are added   memories still  burning of all that we have suffered and of all   that our brethren are still suffering.      Nor,  assuredly,  can it- be said that we limit ourselves to   following with  verbal sympathy and platonic admiration the efforts   mrde by  the oppressed nationalities to accomplish their liberation,   seeing that for the past three years, with untold sacrifices and   with the blood  of thousands upon thousands of our sons and brothers,   we have  been waging a war which, if it was embarked upon and is   now being presecuted in defence of the rights of our people and   cf our right to existence, is nevertheless war against our common   enemy.    And it is our common, and perhaps cardinal interest that   the inexplicable and painful misunderstanding, wMch has somehow   arisen in regard to our war-aims, should be dissipated.   V/e have   here once more  affirmed those aims in limpid and sincere language,   in the&amp;spirit which intimately determines them, as exclusively   directed towards assuring our national integrity and national   security against the secular and implacable menace of a hostile   state&quot;.   Baron SonninoTs speech of Feb. 23rd was in actual content littlemore than an up-to-date repetition of his speech of October, viz. adefence of  Italy&apos;s foreign policy against the charge of imperialism,and a stout refusal to don any sort of white sheet or, in his ownmetaphor, to take  a single step on the way to Canossa.   The defencethis time was in some degree weakened by the fact that the terms ofthe Treaty had now been made public property^;  having been read inthe Chamber by Signor Bevione on Feb. 13th;  but this seems to havebeen compensated by the straightforward patriotism of the speaker andperhaps by the knowledge or  suspicion which his auditors may have hadthat the uncompromising language was dictated rather by expediencythan by obstinacy.   Signor Orlando, replying  to critics  at the close of the session(?eb.  23rd) told the  Chamber that  Italy&apos;s grain-supply had been-guaranteed up to the  end of March.   He took the opportunity of againthanking the Allies for their generous  action in consenting to reducetheir  own allotted share  ox  supplies in ft/our of Italy, in view ofthe  impossibility of  increasing  the-tc4;al--am^un1^^^the  Allies.
   To those who demanded a Parliamentary Commission to  enquire  into the disaster of Caporettd he pointed out that  such a  procedure  would amount to setting uo a tribunal along side of  or-perhaps  in opposition to the Supreme Command to enquire into  the conduct of the array.  Any- body must see that this was impossible.   The  present Commission had been constituted with due respect to the rights  of Parliament.   It- contained three military Specialists, two Senators and  two Deputies.   The speaker went on to deal with the question of the Censorship&quot;and premised a reform which, while giving press writers freedom to  express their opinions, should also fix upon them the  responsibility for what they waeote.   He defended himself against the  charge  of reactionarism and then, turning to the Democrats and  the Socialists who taxed him with blindness to the new issues which  were moving the  world -  Uo one, he said, had higher respect for ideas than himself but  ideas were not sufficient in themselves:  they must make themselves  incarnate  in will                                                            new and act and sacrifice.   He was ready to do homage to these/ideas on one condition - a condition which was in the interest of  the ideas themselves - that the honour paid to them should take the form  of will to overcome the obstacles which lay in  the way of their realisation. This will the Socialists notably failed to display.   The speech ended on a note of intense patriotic feeling and  called forth frantic apolause.   The demand for a Parliamentary enquiry into Capoietto  had been voiced by General Narazzi backed by the Unione Parlamentare in  a speech tfhich betrayed violent personal rancour against  General Cadorna.   The speaker attacked the Government (1) for having nominated  a small Commis- aion of Enquiry instead of proposing a  much wider body  elected  by Parliament;  (2)  for limiting the scope of the  enquiry to the  respon-t sibilities for the tetreat itself instead of permitting an investiga- tion into the whole conduct of the war  since May 1915.    /*fter  giving
his reasons for believing that the German oolitioal offensive wouldbe fallowed, as soon as the snow melted, by a military offensive onthe Italian front, as being the weakest section of the single frontand as covering (in contrast with the northern front) rich andundevastated territory; the general went on to justify his demandfor a wider enquiry.   It was necessary, he said, to go far back inthe history of the war to find the real causes of the Caporettodisaster.  It was necessary to have knowledge of the relations whichexisted between hhe Supreme Command and the subordinate Commands, therank:Jc file and the Government itself.   He would not condemn on the grounds of a single mietate a man whohad a series of.victorious engage,ents to his record.   But Caporettowas the corollary of Bain3izza and Hermada.   The victory of fioriziawas rendered sterile by the orccrastination of operations on theIson-zo.... The action on the Isonzo was never carried through... Inthe Trentino mistake after mistake was committed.....A practicallyimmobile command, was set up at Udine and a servile press createdto adulate the Supreme Command.   As the speech progressed a tumult of protest arose in which manyof the General&apos;s remarks were practically drowned.   Neverthelesshe persevered, carrying his review back to the very beginning of thewar and contending that it was useless to give the enquiry any lessample scope.   In-addressing the Senate on March 4th Signor Orlando again lainstress on the advantages for Italy of solidarity with the oppressednationalities of Austria:  &quot;but this&quot;, he said, &quot;must come aboutwithout involving any need at the present stage to decide what in-fluence this attitude should have upon war-*aims&quot;.   There was atpresent but one war-aim and that was victory.   He again-affirmed the inexorable decision of the Government to
                           - 5 -Maintain the political and moral unity of the country.   He consideredit to be one of its principle duties &quot;to proceed against and punishall those, to whatever class they may belong, who violate or forgettheir duty towards their country   The absence of any declaration from Signor Crespi  in the Chamberof Deputies had apparently caused some uneasiness which the accountgiven by him on March 4th in the senate of his negotiations with theAllies was designed to remove.   According to/telegraphic reoort sent to the Times he stated thatthe agreement signed in London on Jan. 25th assigned to Italy for thepresent,year 34,000,000 quintals (a quintal equals 2801bs) of wheatequality of sacrifice between the Allies was now perfectly applied.Regarding coal, his proposal had been accepted on Feb. 18th and wasbeing carried into effect.   It placed at the disposal of Italy240,000 tens of French and 560,000 tons of British coal per month.Negotiations were proceeding to make up the full mimimum amount re-quired by Italy - namely 690,000 tolls of coal per month,  (jphere issome error in the figures here, as the sum of the monthly allotmentsof French and British coal already ancunts to 800., 000 tons - thequantity generally mentioned as Italyfs minimum requirement. \   Consumption for the civilian population had been reduced sinceFeb. 16th by 10$ in addition to the 50$ reduction already in force,The system of ration cards was being applied everywhere in Italy.   The Silk Ccntrabrand Scandal is attracting much attention andarousing great indignation.   A number of arrests have been made inconnection with it.   The most-sensational ate those of the Comm.Cesare Bonacossa, Deputy for Hareatiea In the pro^rinoe-^CuTTenlce, ofhis uncle Count Primo Bonacossa, of Comm..-ffnecohi and Comm.&apos; CarloPeltrinelli - all -directors of the Milanese Silk-epinning Company.The last named is said to possess a fortune of  8,000,000 and to betheinstead of 30,000,000 as previously arranged.   The principle of
                           -  6  -?che richest man  in  Italy.    On March  1st,  an  official  communique&quot;was issued giving the names  of those  who had  been  arrested up  to thatdate and stating that documents  had been discovered proving  the  ex-istenee of a branch company  at Stolen for  trade  with the  enemy.   The exports of the Company  to Switzerland  are said  to  have  risenenormously during the war, the figures given  being    for 19143000 quintals, for  1915  9000 quintals, for 1916  52,  000 quintals.   The total value  of Italian  exports to Switzerland is given  as 15,800,000 Of which  18,440,000 is covered by silk and silk-floss.   The arrest of these very  wealthy industrialists comes  opportunelyto confirm the President of  Council.&apos;3 declarations to  the Senate con-cerning the Government&apos;s determination to  treat  all traitors withimpartial rigour.   The telegraphic  reports also  describe an attack which  SignorMarconi made in  the Senate on  the Italian  Mission  to the  united  states,affirming that German influences were at work retarding satisfactoryprogress.   Numerous letters,  he said, containing  complaints&apos; from.Italians resident in the United  States had been  held up toy the Censer-ship.  He asked  for a Government enquiry which was promised  by theMinister of the  Treasury,  Signor Hitti.   On Feb. 27th, Lazzari,  Secretary of the Official Sooialist  party,and Bombacci,  Assistant  Secretary, were sentenced  - the f$rj)ae    35months imprisonment and  a fine of 2.500 lire, the  latter  t&amp;  2&amp;^Ctithsimprisonment   and a fine of  2,500 lire.   The Corriere  della  Sera oontinues  its anti-Austrian campaign.? pub-lishing aooounts from various  correspondents  of  a  nature  to  establishtl3e bona fides  of the  oppressed  nationalities, and the geoolo  ofFeb.  16th has  a leading  article  describing the stimulus given,among the Southern Slavs  by  the creation of the  Sseih  Constituent  Assembly of Jan  6th,  and the rapidity with whith the mtrement is gaining  ground.
186                             I  . .  I                            - 7 -  I  It is announced that a Conference is shortly to he held in London  between the British-Italian League and the three ether Societies  especially interested in the future of the Balkans via.,  the Anglo-  Serbian, the Anglo-Hellenic and the Anglo-Rumanian - with a view  to promoting agreement regarding the future of the lands bordering  the eastern shore of the Adriatic.   We may add that at meetings  quite recently held in London a definite agreement was reached be-  tween representatives of the Jugcslavs cn the one hand and an im-II portant group of Italian Parliamentarians on the other as to a detail-  ed programme-of anti-Austrian action, which will shortly be made  public and is likely tc have far-reaching-effects in.Borne..     Royal Decrees were published on Feb. 14th and 15th dealing respec-  tifoely with Civilian and Agrarian Mobilisation.   The former establish  lishes voluntary civilian service fcr war purposes in agriculture,  industry and public Cffioes.   Should sufficient volunteers net come  forward the Government reserves to itself the right to introduce com-  pulsion.   The latter invests the Ministry cf Agriculture, with a  view to augmenting agricultural production, with full powers to con-  trol cultivated lands, to organise agricultural work and tc provide  for the most useful distrib\rtion of the means for production.   The  decree  also empowers the Ministry of Agriculture to occupy all un-  cu&apos;tivated areas.
