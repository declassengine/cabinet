It281INTERIM INDUSTRIAL REOONSTRUOTION COMMITTEES.     The Government has already expressed its approval of theproposals put forward in the Whit ley Report (see copy enclosed)for the establishment in each industry, that has reached asufficient level of organisation, of a Joint Standing IndustrialCouncil consisting of equal numbers of representatives ofAssociations of Employers ani Trade  Unions, and it has entrustedthe Ministry of Labour with the duty of assisting industries incarrying Into effect these proposals,     A large number of such Councils is already in process cfformat ionj but in certain industries, owing to. various reasons,progress has, ae yet, been slow,-   In the latter industries,pending the establishment of Industrial Councils,- the Ministryof Reconstruction has undertaken, in association with the Boardof Trade and the Ministry of Labour, to promote tho formation ofinterim Industrial Reconstruction Committees consisting of equalnumbers of representatives of organisations of Employers andTrade Unions *  ...     What fcrm these &quot;organisations should take must depend onthe circumstances of each industry.   What functions the Committeeshould assume and what they should learn or delegate to existing-organisations or to bodies created for special purposes, are alsoQuestions which must be determined by those concerned.   But it Isnot Intended that the Interim Industrial Reconstruction, Committees,any more than the permanent Industrial&apos;Councils, to which It ishoped they will lead, shsulfi confine themselves to the considerationof subjects specially referred to them by a Government department.It is hoped that they will exercise a large initiative in devisingmeans by wh^ch tho transition from war tc peace conditions maybe most smoothly effected, and the wiry opened to the rapidrestoration of industrial enterprise,        WORK QP INTERIM INDUSTRIAL RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEES*     The most urgent questions to which the attention of InterimIndustrial Rscona^riction Committees should be given are hereindicated;-but it is desired specially to emphasise the importancecf those relating to the promotion.of Industrial organisations andto the questions of employment and supplies of raw materials whicharc the cardinal factors In industrial reconstruction.-(1)  THE. PROMOTION OP INDUSTRIAL ORGANISATION.     The first duty the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committeeswill be invited to undertake , will be the promotion in the industrycf fully representative industrial organisations, both on the sideof the employers and of the employed, together with the formationof a Joint Industrial Council in a form appropriate to the Indus cay./whereby,
I282whereby, apart from the problems of the transitional period under-standings may be arrived at, as scon as possible, which will enable-both parties to co-operate freely in restoring and increasing thoproductive capacity of the country and, in addition, provide thebasis of representative bodies of a mere permanent character foradvising and assisting tho Government Departments concerned, aswell as directly assisting in providing the peaceful and progressivedevelopment to the industry itself.(2)  DEMOBILISATION AND EMPLOYMENT,     (a^* Demobilisation.  The intention of the Government being todemobilise the forces so far as possible in the order determinedby civil requirements, the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committeesshould be prepared to furnish the Ministry of Labour who are dealingwith thia. problem with a comprehensive statement showing whatclasses of men now saving will be most urgently required for thorestarting of the Industry and the approximate numbers in each olase.     The Committees will also be asked to consider;-(b). The Arrangements to be made upon demobilisation for reabsorbinginto each&apos;industry soldiers and war workers for the preparation^,where necessary, of schemes showing the various classes of work-peoplerequired,(c) ,Questiens connected with war pledges affeoting the Industry.(d), Tho steps which may be required to facilitate the earlyrestoration of the trade to peace conditions.(e)  The problems connected with wages, hours, etc, during thotransition period, together with the consideration of schemeswhereby possible unemployment may be mitigated during that time.(f)  Apprenticeship and training, including the training, andconditions of employment of disabled men.                                                       the(g)  The rules and working conditions in connection with/Industryand any extensions thereof,(3)  RAW MATERIALS.     (a).  The Industries Sub-Comulttee of the War PrioritiesCommittee have undertaken ta consider priority applications inrespect of material required for tho manufacture of experimentaltypes, with a view to the post-war development of Trade.   Theycannot give proper consideration to such applications, If presentedseparately, but they would be glad to meet the Interim IndustrialReconstruction Committees and discuss with them the preparation ofa schedule of selected types for which facilities might be given(so far as supplies permit) during war time,     (b).  As regards the position after the  War, It seems probablethat some allocation of supplies by the Government between thevarious industries.may be necessary in the case of some materialsfor a  time, and in order that the total demand should be accurately/estimated
283     and sotting but the industries to which such new manufactures     would most suitably be attached;,  and to make recommendations:-          (a) on the establishment and development of such industries              by the transfer of labour.&apos; machines and otherwise;          (b) as to how a transfer could be made and what organisa-              tion would be requisite for the purpose, with duo              regard to securing the co-operatien of labour&quot;e     With regard to the last words, it is ouldent that thesettlement of working conditions must be undertaken simultaneously;and the- Ministry of Reconstruction has for that reason appointed aparellel Committee of Labour Representatives to consider thelabour questions involved.(7)  THE DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS GOVERNMENT STORES.     An Advisory Board has been established by Girder in Councilto consider and advise on and -    &quot;Tt espeoitc the preparation of any necessary inventories     of property and goods of all descriptions held by Government     Departments, and to consider and advise upon the disposal,     or alternative form of use, of any property of goods ?/hich     have or may become ; during or on tho termination of tho war,     surplus to tho requirements of any Department for the purposes     of that Department&quot;.     The interim Industrial Rdconstruction Committees will be askedto advise the Board on (a) the quantity and kind of goods that canbe absorbed by tho industry; (b; thh steps that should be takento minimize the dislocation of trade that might be caused by therelease in large quantities of marketable articles no longerrequired for war purposes.(8)  GENERAL.     In addition to the foregoing which will become of importanceimmediately upon the cessation of hostilities, Interim IndustrialReconstruction Committees are urged to invite tho ccooperation of .trade organisations referred to in Section (1) as soon as they areformed to take up the consideration of other matters affecting theindustry as a whole, ,such as transport, (involving the question ofcanals, railways, roads, warehouse storage and overseas transport)power-, and housing requirements in regard to education, technicaltraining and scientific research; the recovery and developmentof overseas markets; the stability of home manufactures and theirdefence against foreign combinations and alien penetration; theencouragement of invention and the protection of British rightsabroad, and other matters of a like kind affecting the commercialand manufacturing needs of the&apos; Trade and Industry in thereconstruction period,(I

With regard to the last words, it is evident that thesettlement of working conditions must be undertaken simultaneously;and the Ministry of Reconstruction has for that reason appointed aparellel Committee of Labour Representatives to consider thelabour questions involved.(7)  THE DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS GOVERNMENT STORES.
