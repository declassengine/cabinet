feiorandum for the War Cabinet by the First Lordof the Admiralty.        With reference to Sir Rennell Roddls telegram,No0199 of the 6th March, in which he makes representationsof the urgent necessity for granting coal for Italy, I hopeI may be       forgiven for Interfering in a matter which isnot my direct concern, to impress upon the Cabinet my veryurgent conviction, after personal discussion and investigationon the subject of coal supplies in Italy for Naval and trans-portation purposes, that, unless coal is supplied, Italycannot possibly continue in the war with any energy.   Anydelay in dealing with the situation vail result in its gettingworse - out of all proportion to the shortage of coalB   Notonly can ordinary traffic not move because of the poor andinsufficient locomotive power, but the mere delay in thecirculation of rolling stock, which has now reduced theefficiency by some 33;-, has direct reflex action upon theimportation of further coal, and unless the matter is dealtwith early the  . Fleet will be demobilised and the life ofthe country will come to a standstill with indescribable chaos.(Sgd)   Eric Geddes.Gth March 1918.
