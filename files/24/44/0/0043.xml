Union,  137, Great Clowes Street,     Broughton,         Manchester,            5th March, 1918Dear Sir,            I am  instructed to  ask you to place before the     Cabinet       the very serious  situation that has arisen respecting the payment       of the l2-%fc  Award to time  workers.            On January 7th, last, due to trouble that bad arisen, the       *7ar Cabinet  instructed Sir ^George Askwith to hear an application       and decide whether the 12M had to be  paid to Centre ttors and(5 Hot   others,  I enclose a eopyvof the  A??ard given as a result of thisWo-   Con fere no e,tod.            The members  of the  National  federated Electrical  Association       although they have in nearly all, gases paid the  Award since the       7fcfc4January, have  refused  to p.a*y back  time in accordance with the       Award, from  the 13th October^   The reasons they have given us       are that they have been  unable to obtain from the Ministry of       Munitions, the Admiralty,  an *  the War  Office, sufficient-       guarantees th&amp;t they will  be recouped  for these payments.            The Scottish  Electrical Contractors Association had an       agreement  by whioh wages rose  and fell with the wages  of Ship-       builders,  but they adopted the same  attitude as the National       Federated  Blectileal Association  in  respect to arrears*            The National  federated   Electrical Association have also       refused to pay       the  back tir.se from the  1st of December       of an Award  by the  Committee on Production in similar   terms       to the Award of the  Engineering and  Foundry Trades,            V;e have had interviews  with  sir George Askwith, the Chief       Industrial Commissioner, and Sir  pavid Shackleton,  Secretary       to the Ministry of Labour,  in each case unsuccessfully.            Due to  the non-compliance of these  Associations  with the       Government Awards,    h,ave had tha  greatest difficulty in       inducing our members to  remain .:t \?ork,  in fact over 200 of them       ceased *-orfc  on the  Clyde and caused serious delay in the  com-       pletion of some Government Ships.   The remaining members are       threatening  to cease ^ork  all  over the  Country unless we  can       give  them some assurance  that the money they are  clearly       entitles to  untfer  the Awards ia guaranteed to then.
     At eu  Bxecu&amp;lre Council meeting held  on  the 2ud torch,tha  e-Xlevying resolution FSS passad:-     m hat in Tiev? of the seriousness of the peeition, vie      request the War Cabinet to enforce the payment of the      Awards end they he informed that failing compliance      with the Awards, there seems no alternative for the      men but to cease work forthwith.  They be further      requested to  meet a deputation at once  to place      the fact before them *m6 that copies  of thie letter      bs for^hrdeci to the Minister of Labour, Mi-iietsr      of Munitions, Secretaries to the Admiralty and the      War Office&quot;.&apos;      la Tiew of the facts placed before you and the desirahili of preventlug a most undesirable dispute, I trust you will give this letter your immediate consideration^                               Yours faithfully,                                  (Sgd)  J.
