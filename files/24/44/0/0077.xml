The housing  situation if  the war ended  ..t  one;:,  wouldcore let in:(a) a housing shcrta e of between 300,000 and 400,000 for Eng-    land and &quot;ales and lu:.;., OCO for  Scotland,  and a substantial  &apos;  number dor the urban districts  of Ireland,    (This estimate excludes  the replacement  of  slum dwellings&apos;)&apos;.&apos;.(b) The existence  of large numbers  of slum dwellings and    slur, areas in  the  whole  of the  United Kingdom..    Those slures  ire greater  in number and worse as  regards    conditions than before the war  owing tc  the practical    cessation by  local Authorities  of work under PAkdo I, and    II, of the Housing Act and owing  to the  dnorhgg.  of Labour    and material  for the repair of  houses.    The urgent necessity for a large  scheme  for building newhouses immediately after the war is based on the ft Hewingconsiderations;     The clearance of  slum areas and  tho closing of elum houses
23cannot be offectively ur^o*tf4-on unless there is sufficientalternative aocoromodcebioje for those irhabitan os who arc dig -placed.    At present those slum dwellings arc not merely inhabi-tod but in many cases overcrowded.  On the cessation of hostili-tias and the demobilisation of tho army, the situation will be-come extremely acute and  a large  vpropo* tion of all existingaccommodation, whether bad or good, will be overcrowded.     The effects of health and physical deterioration ofovor-crcwding and of insanitary and defective housing.    &quot;whorethere is confined spa^e.  insufficient air, lack of sunlight,dampness, bad drainage  or overcrowding diceace spreads morerapidly and there is a  serious increased both in infant mortalityand the general death rate.   It is unnecessary  to give evidencein support of this statement  which is too well-known to needsubstantiation,   The following illustrations of Its truthmay be mentioned:-           &apos;&quot;Lr, Hair, who made a  special  investigation into  the            subject, found that the number of deaths from puimone            disease  and the diseases  of young children were            half as much  again in back to back houses as in            ordinary dwelling houses ,&apos;&quot;         again            &quot;An examination of the reports of the London Tuber-             culosis D  spenaaries shows that one half of the             patients under the care  of these its titutions IIvj             in dwellings, with one or two rooms only. . In the             report  of  ore of these dispensaries re find:-                u !Only  134 out of 756 patients  suffering&apos; from                  definite signs  of pulmonary tuberculosis oc-                  cupicd  separate rooms at night time.  The                  others  were  sloepin&quot; in rooms shared by ore or                  more  persons, and of  these only 179 slept  in                  doparato beds,  the  remaining  453 actually                  sleeping in the same beds  as  ore  or more mem-                  bcrs  of the  family.I1!     The effects upon the general standard of life of fcad andinsufficient housing.   Powers&apos;of  resistance  whether physical  -or mop  al are  steadily sapped  by the cumulative  effect ofunsatisfactory housing  conditions and. dismal surroundings.
240Thus,  the Interdepartmental Commit too on Physical Deteriorationemphasised the close connections between bad housing conditionsand intemperance.  Lioroover, where there is over crowding.it is impossible to arrange for the separation of the sexoov-ith results which need not bo elaborated here.     Closely connected with tho foregoing are- the effects ofbad housing upon Industrial unrest.    In seven out of theeight districts&apos; reports of the Royal Commission on Industrialunrest, attention is dra-;;n to the  fact of insufficient andbad housing being a cause of unrest.  (It must be rememberedthat those Commissions reported at a time when some four mil-lion men were awf  from their homes on active service orin can ps and hospitals in this country).   The followingextracts - Illustrate this:     North Eastern Area,   (Page 4).          Tho Commis si oners do not  think  It necessary to     refer to the Housing question in greater detail,     as  it is prominently before  tho nation as a problem     which must  be solved as  soon as  c ire urns tan cc s permit,     but they have thought  it right to point  out that - it     was put :3orward as one of tho general  causes  of      Industrial  Unrest, which should  in  the national      interest be dealt with at an early  date.Yorkshire &amp; Rast Midlands Area.   (Page 6)     It should be desirable  that a ssurance shouldbo given by the Prree Rinistor that at the end oftho &quot;&quot;war a large programme of Spcial Reform will beintroduced by&quot;the Government, this Including ospecial-ly sufficient increase In,  and improvement of,housing accommodation, and  provision for the prcven-tion and relief of unemployment.London &amp; South Eastern Area.   (Pago 3).     Further, owing  to the  largo  influx of labourinto areas where munition workRhas been largelyacrrioc on the housing accommodation has been aorohlem of considerable  gravity,  tho accommodationbeing wholly  inadequate  and tho   prices charged undulyinflated.South Restorn Area.  (Pago 3),     The following is a minor cause of unrest:-     Shortage of housi^e&quot; ac c cmwoC- at ion.
241&apos;^ly:.?JI-Qcluc&quot;Lin  Hormiouthshirc.   Pages  53  and 44).     It is  clear from the largo  amount of ovidoncoreceived that unsatisfactory  surroundinrs and  theinadequacy  of housin.  accommodation  in Wales andI&apos;:Ioit&apos;..outhsIiiroj and especially  in the South WalesCoalfield,  is a factor  of great  importance in  thocausation of unrest,  it is  estimated  that theshortage of houses in the period immediately precedingx-ne ear was between 4Q,0p0 and  60,000 and  owingto the practical suspension  of building operationssince the war tho position is  becoming&quot;daily more serious.        b Gotland..             T.e  have had startling revelations of the        acute need of houses in industrial centres.   The        want of  housing accommodation is undoubtedly a eer-        ious cause of unrest,  as well as a danger to the        public health,...... In round numbers,* the present        situation appears to be that in Scotland there is        immediate need for somewhere about 100, CCD workers&apos;        houses,  that practically no building has taken        place during the war,  and that, for some years        defer- that, the number of such houses built was        not sufficient to meet the increasing demand for        them.  The Industrial Unrest attributable to this        cause,  It is strong It represented&quot;, can enlw be allow-        ed by th-. Government taking steps to grapple with        a  problem which appears to&quot;have grown too. ereat far        private  enterprise now to meet, by in some way hav-        ing land in the neighbourhood of congested in-        dustrial districts made available on reasonable        terms for building working-class houses, and by        rendering financial aid for building ewped.itiously        the urgently wanted houses.        But the strongest illustration  of all is containedin the saoecial report upon Barrow-in-Iurness District by theCommissloners of the Perth v-eStorn Ares..    The Commissionersshow the appalling results of  allowing industrial developmentwithout ensuring the growth of housing accommodation.   Thewhole of the report should he  road, but we may refer to thefollow in--  specific passages : -     Barrow-in-Purness district    (Pages  51 and  54,)          he venture to suggest  that  it is a matter     the Par Cabin at should&quot;at once hand  over to some     really authoritative person to deal  with.   --hat     is wanted  Is  someone entirely different iirstatus     and. powers from the inspectors and other officials     who have from time to time  visited Barrow  and     made  reports to London.   Someone might well be     sent down  without delay,  with a  proper staff,     to formulate an emergency housing scheme and carry     It out with the full force  of the Cabinet  at his     each  and with power to  insist upon every dopart-     ment  in -London, inciting the treasury, obeying
      his orders promptly.           The condition,  to  our mind,  is  a  vcrv  serious      and urgent one,  and  if  not dealt  with  at  once  will      naturally be  the  cause  of  serious unrest  in tho future.   .  It is true that difficulties were  increased  in  munition andshipbuilding areas  owing to the  large influx of population,but it must be pointed  out that  on  demobilisation theconditions will he  as acute in practically all  the largo townsas they were in munition areas at the date of the Commission&apos;sInvestigation.   Moreover, shipbuilding areas will be stillmore overcrowded after  the war than they are  now.  In the  towns onthe Tyne, the hoar  and  the Toes  there is not  a  tenement house tobe obtained and many of the hotels  have been commandeered  forworkers.  In Bristol people are  paying  from  two to five poundsfor the key of a house,  while certain  of  the now populationwill return to their homes after the war this will be mere  thancounter-balanced by the return of soldiers and  callers.Pood productIpfl. - after  the war will be greatly  hindered if alargo rural housing scheme is not immediately undertaken.   The pre-war shortage in the rural  districts (estimated  at 120,000) hasbeen still further  increased by  the cessation of  building  during  thewar and by the policy of ploughing  up two  million additional acrescf grass land which will necessitate in Itself  the supply  of at least30,000 new cottages.    The soldiers and sailors are  not goingback to tho land whatever  the attractions  of an open air lifeunless they are reasonably sure  of  decent  homes.   VihilD marriedsoldiers who were formerly on the land  in  many  cases have  cot-tages to return to, single men desirous of marrying  will bounable generally to find homes in country  districts.   The samewill bo true of those who  wish to settle on  the land but f rmerlylived, in tho towns.     In tho urban districts also it must be  remembered thatbefore production can be increased  it is necessary to havehouses  fagj producers  to live  in.   This has  been  found in  thecase of -munition -areas  during.thc-w.   Housing  has been  thought
of last instead of first with the result that production hasbeen retarded and as wo have shown considerable unrest created.     Tho necessity for providing employment concurrently withrapid demobilisation Is one of the strongest arguments forsetting on foot a large housing scheme as soon as possible afterthe war.  It will not be possible to re-establish qtdoM-rthose industries for which raw materials -are scarce -or have tobe Imported.   gut building materials can bo produced almostontirel  in this country.  It is true that there will go ashortag  of timber, but experiments ar^ now being made forroducing the quantity of timber used In the building of cottagesto a minimum.     Practically, all tho other materials fee&apos;building such as bricks, slates, tiles, cement, ironmongery,and glass, can bo produced in this country from the home supply ofrW-matferl&amp;lc.  Thus a comprehensive scheme for the building ofof a large number of houses, ready to be put into operationimmediately after the declaration of peace, will materially assistin solving the unemployment problem.   honk would be provided  forbrick-mahors, and others engaged in the manufacture- of buildingmaterial, for bricklayers, masons, carpenters, joiners, anaplumbers and all others taking pant In the actual building  ofhouses.   Not only this, it would provide direct employment fora large number of workers In road-making, sewering, and estatedevelopment j and indirect employment to  others in the furnishingcoed other trades.  It  is not exaggerating  to  say that , having  regardto the  large number of houses reqi ired,  work might be providedIn this way  for over one million wen, and this would be thelargest s ingle contribution to the unemployment problem.     There will be cons iderablo saving wo the  State owing to  theorovision end employment  for  so large a  number of men e id theconsequent more rapid  demobilisation.  It  is  obvioi sly better  thai, ;men  should  be  employed productively  In making  building materialsand building rather  thanbo  kept for  a long  time  In  the Army,or paid unemployment benefit.,   honey which the State would other-wise pay the men as  soldiers  and.  their  families  by  way  of separation
2447,     allowance would &quot;bo paid for- proauotivo work,10.       Of course tho most important reason is that  hones must he     provided for the returning soldiers and sailors.   As Hr. YJaltor     Long, when President of the Local Government Doard said:-     &quot;It would Indeed bo a crime - u black crime -  ifreading as wo do tho wonderful accounts of the sufferingswhich our heroes have to undergo in the tronchec , . ,wo sat still now and did nothing, , ... To lot them comefrom horrible water-logged trenches to something littlebettor then a pigsty hero would  indeed be criminal onthe part of ourselves,  and would bo a negation of all wohave said during this war, that  no can never repay thosemen for what they have  done  for  us.1&apos;
