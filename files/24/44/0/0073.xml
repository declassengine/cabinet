The following correspondence has passed between the C.I.G.S, andthe British Military Representative at&quot;Versailles as to the procedureregarding the carrying out of the instructions of the Executive WarBoard, so far as such instructions affect tho movement of BritishTrocpge*                      (Signed), M,P,A.HANSEY,                   *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,081/148/424.The British Military Representative,      Supreme War Council,           VERSAILLES.     I think It necessary that we should arrive at an early understand-Ing ss to how the instructions of the Executive Committee of theSupremo War Council for tho movements of reserves should bo carriedcut, as far ae they affect British troops.   It appears to me that suchmovements may frequently affect questions of supply, administrationand organisation, and that the Executive Committee has not themachinery to enable them to deal adequately with such questions.   Itherefore propose that you should telegraph to me the decisions of theExecutive Committee,  repeating them to the Commandors-in-Chief concern-e&amp;, and that any executive orders which it may be necessary to issueto tho ConiBandoys-in-Chief should emanate from tho War Office,   Asdirect telegraphic communication has been established betweenVersailles and. the War Offioo, little, if any, delay will be causedby this procedure, which will, in my judgment, tend to obviate anypossible overlapping and confusion in carrying out.the rocommendationsof the Executive Committee,     I should be glad of your observations as oarly ae possible, and acopy of this letter is being sent to our Commandors-in-Chiof in Pranceand Italy,                        (Signed).
