Ueiaoraridiua by the secretary  of  otate                     for the Air -Porco. 1*     It is urgently necessary, in connection with  the  subject  of air policy at the supreme War Council, to define the  relation  between the Air Service and the (Supreme Var Council,   The  Chief  of  the Air Staff visited Versailles last week and discussed tho  -juestion  of a.ir representation there, 2,     By their joint Kote,  $o,7, of January 9th,  1918,  (which was approved by the S*W,C. ) the liilitary Representatives  of  the British, French and Italian sections made recommendations to the  s* 7.0, for promoting co-ordination in Inter-Allied aviation and  proposed  that an Inter-Allied Sxpert Committee should be formed and that  each Section of the S..(*0. should have upon its permanent staff an officer  who should be an ox-officio member of this Committee which would,  from time  to time, report to the  b*&apos;.&apos;/,C.        thereupon,  the ..&apos;ar Cabinet,  (V;ar Cabinet 322,  Minute IE) (January 15th)  decided that  it was highly desirable that each  Section of the S,W*0. should have attached to  its staff an officer who had considerable knowledge of air organisation,  etoa and they therefore requested the Air Minister to arrange  for the loan of an officer so that  the  Military ^Representatives on the i*,7.,C, might get as full information  as  possible  as to the possibilities of aerial attack and defence, 3*      In pursuance  of this  request  of  tho  War Cabinet,  an officer was selected from the  Air ^taff  by the  Air  Ministry to be attached to the  British  Section,  so ae to furnish  information  to  the  Military Representatives on the b,&quot;,C, 48      This  officer has  been  at  Versailles  for some weeks,  but  there seems  to bare been at  first some  misunderstanding at  Versailles ae  to his duties and  statue, as, up to  General  Tronch&amp;rd&apos;s  visit last week, ho had  aot been taken  on  the  strength of  the establishment or appoint- ed definitely to a position in the British  section.   MXV mieunder- etandlng, however, is  now  in  a fair way to be  cleared up,  and  what is needed  is that the organisation,  at regards  aerial  information  and advice, should be definitely  and  clearly  settled, 5,      In settling this  organisation, the following considerations must be borne in mind.   Tho British Air Itoree  la  in course  of being separated both from the ilavy  and  the Army and  it  in of great import- a&amp;tse that neither of these latter cervices bhould fcol that  its aerial fOros  is being absorbed by the other,   he harmonious  working of  thesow Air Force spends upon the B,ft.A,b, and  H.i\Q,  feeling that theft&amp;vy and the Army stand  on a common levels   AS  there  is already a Supreme Y/ar Council, with military representatives, and an Allied$aval Council, it would seem logical to create  an Allied  &amp;ir Council,But as none of our allies have a separate Air oorvioc  this would  be impracticable and, moreover,  since moat of the  aviation which comesunder consideration ii. necessarily connected with the  Uavy or thoArmyt  the functions of providing aerial information and advioe  will bobest discharged by securing close and direct association  both with  the s&amp;naaeni Military Representative at Versailles and v;ith  the Britishrepresentative on the Allied Naval Counoil,
                             KM   w 6 9     By the so nwana it will bo possible to keep  in close touch with proposed schemes of operations and to study how bost to eapv* the Air Force in connection v/ith these operations.   2or example?^ the question will constantly arise, what is tho proper amount and kind of aircraft required to essist in a giyen operation and from what source the aircraft required could be obtained.  Again, the EC suitable objectives and methods of bombing - ould form a subject of study by such an organisation. 7,      Up to tha present none  of our Allies represented on the 3,W, have appointed any Air Officer and Col, arises is therefore as yet without any corresponding colleague; but it is presumed that th* ether Allies intend to act upon the joint Hots referred to in para- graph 3 of this memorandum in  the same way in which we have already acted upon it,    ^hen this occurs,  it will be possible to fcrs tha later-Allied Committee which is part of the echoes laid down in tho joint JJote,  and this Committee would moot at Yersaillea from time t\ timo*   It should aleo contain,  on the  British side, an&apos;  officer sent for the  purpose of  representing the Air i&apos;oroo in jPremce,  and another sent  expressly from the  Air Mini at ry.    iho Chief of the Air  staff would himself  attend,  in  place  of this last named officer, whenever circumstances made this desirable, 8*      The  organisation,  therefore,  which should bo formally author isod and set  up  forthwith,  is  as follows  i-      (a)  An Air  Branch,  immediately under the  British lorm&amp;nent         Military Representative,  to bo set  up at Versailles.   The         head  of  this Branch will ultimately be  a Brigadier-General,         appointed by the  Air Ministry,  with an  6,0*1*(at  present         Cole  Armes)  under hiau   $or the  present  It will be  sufficie        until a  Brigadier-General becomes available,  for  CoLArmes         to  be the head of tho  Branch,   Ro will  noed one assistant,      (b)  The  head of the  Air Branch should  be directly under,  and         should have  direct  access to,  the Permanent Military         Repre sentat i vo *      (c)  The  head of the  Air Branch, together with an officer  rep-         re senting tho Air Force  in  J?ranoa,  and  a representative         specially summoned  from  the Air Ministry,  will be  the  Briti        Members  of  the Inter-Allied Aviation  Conmittee vvhich will        meet  from timeto  time  for ths  purposes  above  indicated, &amp;E         soon  as  the  other Allies have  constituted  their oral Air         representatives at  Versailles.      (d)  At the  same  time,  arrangements should be  ma da whereby, v.fce        the Allied Naval  Council meets  in London,  the .iir Ministry         should be rep resented  on tho Council by  an  Air officer: one         officer  would probably bo sufficient, 9,      She  Secretary  of otate for the Air i&apos;orce  tmbmits the above observations  to  the  War Cabinet, with the request that the necessa.w action may now be taken up  authorise and make tho above arrangementAs soon as the position is  thus  defined, Col, Armes will be in aposition  to supply to the liilitary Represent at ivo aerial infona&amp;tio&quot;and advice, and the  objoct  aimed at in tho joint Kote will be so faaooompllahad.Air Ministry,   March 5th, 1918,
