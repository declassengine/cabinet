     It seems now to be practically certain thatRoumania will shortly regard herself as being compelledto make peace, and that one of the terms of that peacewill confer upon Germany the right of railway access toOdessa,     The desire to obtain supplies of corn furnishesa sufficient motive for Germany&apos;s policy in this matter.But is it the only motive?     Railway facilities to a port on the Black Sea wouldenable Germany to have access first to Batoum, then toBaku., and finally, by the Caspian., to North-West Persia.     The political consequences of this change in therelation of South-East Russia to Germany, especiallysince, by the Bolshevist surrender, Trans-Cansasia ishanded over to the Turk, are evidently important; buttheir Importance, at least in the immediate future,largely depends on the military value of this new routefrom Berlin to the Caspian.     Tt seems to me therefore to be very important thatthe General Staff should consider and report upon thevarious aspects of this question; e*g.t the transportof troops to Odessa, the facilities for carrying themasross the Black Sea to Batoum, and then by railway toBaku or Julfa.  We should be told whether we are likelyto be forced, under these now conditions, to modifyour military action in Mesopotamia, Palestine,, or North-Most Persia: and we shall thereafter have to considerwhether these modifications in the military outlookinvolve corresponding changes in our diplomatic policy.(Initialled)AeJ.Bt.Foreign Office.
