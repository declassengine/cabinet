U      47.1,1&quot; lil&apos;%&apos;rf\ T  14*43CJMXTIEE  ON  CIVIL  DISTURBANCE.n A1 1------yj-__-__________.____-    ^                                                                      1     On the 5th February the War Cabinet appointed a Departmental  Committee  over which Ipresided to consider the steps to be taken in the event of serious industrial  troublearising in connection with the attitude of the engineers to the Government^ manpowermeasures (War Cabinet Minutes 339, Conclusion 4.b.).   Representatives  attended from theWav Office, Admiralty, Ministry of National Service, Ministry of Munitions,  Local  Govern-ment Board, Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Pood.   The Committee report  as follows:-      The present position is that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers have voted by a  majority of 9 to 2 against the proposals of the Ministry of National  Service for calling:  up men for the Army, and that this may be followed by a strike.    The indications are  that no general strike is likely to take place;  but the danger  is that there may be a  local strike, e,g. if one or two shop stewards were oalled up on the  Clyde or at  Sheffield, and that a strike once begun in one area may spread to others and become  general.   If the Amalgamated Society of Engineers were to strike, the Electrical Trade  Union, the Moulders and some other Unions would be likely to follow.      We have considered what action should be taken in that event.  This will necessarily  depend on circumstances, and no exact scheme of action oan be laid down beforehand. Deportation.  The suggestion that leaders should be deported under Defence of  the  Realm  Regulation 14 was mentioned, but we were unanimously against it.. Prosecution under Defence of the Realm Regulations.  Jf drastic aotion becomes necessary,  we think that, if evidence is available, the instigators of the strike should  be  prosecuted under Defence of the Realm Regulations 42 and 48 and proceedings  taken to  prevent the payment  of  strike pay.   In order to facilitate aotion under this  head, we  recommend the insertion in Regulation 42 after the word &quot;attempts&quot; of the  words  &quot;or  does  any act calculated or likely11.   Persons inciting to a strike which is calculated   (e.g.)  to impede  shipbuilding can then be prosecuted under Regulation 48 for &quot;inciting&quot;;  and persons paying  strike pay in such a strike may be oharged with &quot;aiding and abetting&quot;  under the same regulation.   It must, however, be borne in mind,  in any proceedings  under Regulation  42,  that a pledge was given by Mr. Lloyd George  in the House  of  Commons  in January  1916 that that Regulation would not be used against individual work-  men whose  offences  could  be dealt with under the Munitions of War Act, 1915, without ill   .   imprisonment.  rwteotion of Workers,  As  regards  the  protection  of workers who refuse to  strifeie, it is &apos; anticipated that public feeling will be so strongly against  the Amalgamated Society of  Engineers in the event of a strike that protection will  not  be required.   In any case,  it would be impossible for the Polioe to give non-strikers protection in thoir owft  homes.   It is generally impracticable even in time of peace, when  the  total number of  Police Constables in England and Wales is about 55,000,   At present, owing to the with-  drawal of men for the Army and for special war services, the trtal  number of Police is  reduced to less than 42,000.   The Police should, however,  give what protection they  can at the works and should at once put a stop to picketing, the Law Officers having  advised both as regards England and Scotland that in a strike which affeots the pro-  duction of war material the Police have power to deal at once with  piokets.      It is desirable that soldiers and War Munition and War Work Volunteers should injV^the evont of a strike of the Amalgamated Sooiety of Engineers remain at work.  If it  is likely to be necessary to keep them within the works, arrangements should be made
  to house and feed them.Rict or Disturbance.  The question of dealing with disturbance has also been oonsidered.  Here again we do not consider there is serious danger, public opinion being so strongly-  opposed to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,   If disturbances should occur, the  number of Police to deal with them is much restricted owing to thoir depleted numbers,  Un the other hand, they will, in many places, have the assistance of large bodies of  Special Constabulary.   It would be most undesirable to employ troops except in the ver;,  last resort when actual rioting is taking place.   The military forces now in this .  oountry, both officers and men, are for the most part only partially trained, and the  same discipline and patience cannot be expected of them as of regular troops in peace  time.   When troops fire on rioters, the persons killed are almost always innocent  spectators, and an untoward incident might oause an outbreak of feeling whioh might do  far more mischief than the direct result of any riot.   The Home Office has already-  issued a circular to Chief Constables warning them against applying for military  assistance except in cases of extreme necessity.Substituted Labour.  In case of a strike of the Electrical Trade Union, it may be  necessary in the interests of public safety to employ soldiers and sailors to work soms  of the Power Stations - particularly those which are necessary for the maintenance of  cold storage of meat, for the working of searohlights, and for the working of munition  works and of tramways carrying munition workers.   The War Cabinet has already given its  assent to arrangements for this purpose being made in the MetropolisJ and schemes for  selecting certain works and employing soldiers and sailors are being worked out by the  Commissioner of Police In consultation with the Military Authorities.   In other towns,  where the maintenance of electric supply affeots the national safety, it may be  neoessary for the same course to be taken, and arrangements for this purpose should be  concerted between the Police, the Naval and Military Authorities, and the Managers of  the Works involved.   It is, however, very undesirable that any general instructions on  this subject should be issued.   We think that the Ministry of Munitions should indicat  those places - as few in number as possible - where interests of vital importance are  involved, and the local Naval or Military Authorities and the Polioe should receive  instructions to work out the necessary arrangements with the Managers of the Works und  conditions of absolute secrecy.   There is no doubt that public opinion would support  such action when it was known that the supply of food or the protection of the town  against enemy attack was in danger, but if the proposal to employ soldiers and sailors  in place of workmen wire to become public before the absolute necessity for suoh actic  and its narrow limits were realized, serious trouble might result.                                                                 0. CAVE.5th March,  1918.
