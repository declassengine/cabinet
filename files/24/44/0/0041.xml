March 1918.SECEET.G.T.-3841.1QTHE  LABOUR  SITUATION.Report fi&apos;om the Ministry of Labour for the week ending&quot; the 6th March, 1918.                                  SUMMARY.Part I: General Remarks.    The Labour situation and the food situation are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.    The opinion of the Labour press on the Inter-Allied Conference, the Russiansituation, Lord Northcliffe and propaganda,  the A.S.E. and man-power, the LabourParty&apos;s constitution, on food, and war aims is summarised.Part III:  District Reports.    The general situation continues distinctly satisfactory, and the food situationlias improved.  Unrest is apparent in certain  areas owing to the dismissal of workersfrom munition factories.Part IV:  Disputes.    (a.) Involving stoppage of vjork. There  are  few  serious strikes,  the  mostimportant being those of the ioiners at Dumbarton and at  Harland and WoliFs,Belfast. Several strikes at aviation factories  have occurred.    [b.) Not involving stoppage of work. The most important dispute threatenedis that  of the tramway workers, who demand  an advance of 11. per week on pre-warrates.   The number of disputes has decreased during the week.                            i. GENERAL REMARKS.Labour Situation.    The  tranquillity in the industrial  world which has been reported for the lasttwo or three weeks continues.  There are few existing  disputes or strikes of anyserious importance, and the latest  information with regard to the attitude of theA.S.E. in connection with  the man-power proposals indicates the possibility thatthe problem which has existed in connection with that union may prove capable ofsolution.    The reduction of the staffs  employed in certain munition factories hasnaturally given rise to anxiety with regard to future prospects of employment.  Thematter has not, however, as yet become acute, and a fair proportion of the  displacedworkers are stated to have  obtained employment  elsewhere.Food Situation.    The most marked feature of the week has been the increased unrest among theworkers in the Tyne Area,  which appears to have been  due practically entirely todifficulties in connection with food.   The food situation in general, however, showssigns of improvement,  and  the arrangements for compulsory rationing in Londonand the Home Counties have not only  been  welcomed by the working classes, buthave indeed been more successful  than could have  been anticipated at the commence-ment.   It is true that these arrangements have  not entirety disposed of the  food      [1100-19]                                                     B
queues, but this will probably right itself when people learn that postponement ofpurchase to the last possible minute entails waiting in queues.    On the whole it may be said that compulsory rationing had a good press.  Thereare, however, widespread  complaints that the amount of meat allowed on. the meatcards is insufficient for men  whose work is of specially onerous kind.;  This is doubt-less a fact, and considerable  pressure will be brought to bear to ensure special treat-ment  of the &quot; very hard &quot; and the &quot; hard &quot; worker.   Though such treatment isjustified in principle, in practice it will prove exceedingly difficult to discriminatebetween the workers of different classes, and, with the experience of the 12^ pei cent.advance, it seems very probable that any attempt to grant special rations to specialclasses of workers will result in grave and widespread unrest, which would probablyonly be overcome by extending the  more liberal ration to manual workers of everykind.   That this measure is impossible is  indicated by the necessity for rationingat all.    Apart from the difficulty of  discrimination  between the various classes ofworkers, there is the additional difficulty of ensuring that special cards for specialworkers are only used by men actually employed in the privileged  class.  This isa difficulty which is by no means  insuperable, but which will add to friction in theadministration  of the differentiated rations.                             II -PEESS COMMENTS.The Inter-Allied Conference.     The Conference of Inter-Allied  Socialists in London is the principal subject ofdiscussion in the Labour and Socialist press of the past week.     On the whole,  the comment  is  extraordinarily  favourable, discordant  notescoming only from the extreme wings.    The &quot; Call,&quot; for example, thinks  that theInternational has again been betrayed, and that &quot; the outcome of the Conference iscalculated to prolong the war.&quot;  The &quot; British  Citizen,&quot;  on the other hand, poursscorn on the whole affair, calling  it &quot; a  comic interlude.&quot; and  affirming that  &quot; themountain in labour has brought forth a mouse &quot; &quot; the business of Allied Socialistsis now in liquidation, and for the.present we need not worry much in regard to  whatthey choose to say or do.&quot;     &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; New Witness,&quot; however, confess to being &quot; agreeably dis-appointed,&quot; though the programme of war aims enunciated is far from being thatwhich they desire the former goes so far as to say that it might be willing to supportan Internationa,!  Socialist Conference.     The XL.P. papers seem fairly satisfied.    The &quot; Labour Leader &quot;  thinks thatthe Conference reached &quot; a measure of unanimity greater   than  was  expected,&quot;though the proposals as regards Alsace-Lorraine and Italia Irredenta, are  &quot; highlyunfortunate.&quot;    This expresses the views of the front-page writer in &quot; Forward &quot;and  of the &quot; Bradford Pioneer.&quot;   The  &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; Common Sense &quot; take asimilar view, though the latter does not regard the memorandum as rigid, but ratheras a &quot;basis  for negotiations, framed and intended as such.&quot;  The I.L.P. press  is,needless to  remark,  very angry about its exclusion from the Conference.     The most whole-hearted support comes from the moderates, such  as the &quot;  NewStatesman,&quot; which regards the memorandum &quot; as a frank and honest avowal of whatthe organised working class of the Allied nations believes itself to be fighting for &quot;;the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; which talks about &quot; a  big  step forward  &quot;; and themiddle-page writer in &quot; Forward,&quot; whose views are always less pacifist  than is thegener^il tone of the paper.The  Russian Situation.     This topic has forced itself into the press, which has recently been rather charyof dealing  with  it.    The comment is, however, more sympathetic and  favourableI ban might have been expected.     The extremists tend more and more to  blame the Western Allies for the coursewhich events have taken.  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; &quot;  Forward,&quot; &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;and  &quot; Call &quot; affirm in almost identical terms that the Governments  &quot; hate the Eevo-lution much more than they hate  German militarism,&quot;  and  that they  desertedKerensky and the Revolution in their hour of need.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; rather
naively suggests that if the Allies had been present at Brest the  German  termswould have been  impossible.    The &quot; Herald &quot; is bold enough  to  hold  that  theBolsheviks &quot; are establishing themselves and bringing order out of chaos.&apos;&apos;    The attitude of the &quot; New Witness/&apos;  &quot; Clarion,&quot; and &quot; British Citizen &quot;  israther that of &quot; I told you so.&quot;  The last named continues its fierce attacks on Trotskyand his kind, while the &quot;  Clarion &quot; hopes that our pacifists will take the lesson of&quot; No annexations and no indemnities &quot; to heart.   The &quot; New Vfitness &quot; also warnsthe nation, and says  that  &quot; we do not want Mr. Ramsay Macdonald,   as  PrimeMinister, explaining that a knee on his chest prevents him from expressing himself.&quot;Lord Northcliffe and Propaganda.    The  new  Department of  Propaganda, more particularly Lord NortheliftVsposition in it, comes in for a  surprisingly  large  amount  of  hostile  criticism, allsections being united in deploring what has happened.    Perhaps the &quot;Co-operative News&quot; is most characteristic when it doubts whether&quot; any good is done by so-called propaganda in enemy countries,&quot; but. even if it isdesirable,  &quot; it by no means follows that Lord Northcliffe is a fit and proper person tobe charged with that mission &quot;- it is like asking &quot; Von Tirpitz or Count Reventlowto try to persuade the English people that  German aims were innocent of all terri-torial ambitions.&quot;   &quot; Justice &quot; looks forward &quot; with grave  concern and anxiety &quot; tothe effect of Lord Northcliiie&apos;s energies, while the I.L.P. papers, such as &quot; Forward &quot;and the &quot;  Leicester  Pioneer,&quot; are bitterly satirical.The A.S.E. and Man-Power.    This  subject attracts  rather less attention than  during previous  weeks,  thegeneral impression being that the A.S.E. are marking time.  The &quot; Herald &quot; does, infact, suggest that the &quot; next move appears to lie with Sir Auckland Geddes.&quot;    The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot;  and the &quot; Call &quot; hold that the result of the ballot isin reality  a clear vote for &quot; peace  by negotiations,&quot; though such questions as  thecalling up of dilutees may have had  something  to do with  it,   The  &apos;&apos;&apos; BritishCitizen &quot; continues its attacks on the A.S.E., who &quot; consider themselves as craftsmenapart from  and superior to all others &quot;; while in the &quot; Clarion &quot; there is the con-tinuation  of the noteworthy article, &quot; The Engineers and Ma,n-Power : a  Statementof the Workers&apos; Case,&quot; which was referred to last week.   The writer reflects much ofthe current suspicion that the war has become^ even if it did not start as, a capitalistenterprise.  His main thesis is, however, that &quot; we must democratise the machineryof the war, and until we do the Government will get all the opposition it  asks fromthe engineers and the  people.&quot;The Labour Party&apos;s Constitution.    The adoption of their new Constitution by  the Labour  Party is taken rather asa matter of course, and but little is added to the commentary of a month ago.    The &quot; Nation &quot; makes  the  somewhat trite remark that it &quot; is an event of highpolitical importance.&quot;   The &quot; New Statesman &quot; takes particular note of the bid forthe women&apos;s vote contained in the representation of women on the Central Executive.The  &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; reflects the apprehension of the  textile workers  asregards the admission of individual voters, but has come to the conclusion that &quot; thereis no real  fear.&quot;  &quot; Justice,&quot; however, refuses to modify its  view on that point.    The &quot; Labour Leader&apos;s &quot; joy is marred by the treatment accorded to the I.L.P.,and the paper talks about the &quot; narrow-mindedness of some trade unionists &quot;; whilethe &quot;  Herald &quot; is  very optimistic, and hopes &quot; there will be  a large accession of menand women of all ranks, and that Labour at the next election  will secure a triumphantmajority in the House of Commons.&quot;Food,    The compulsory rationing scheme is the chief topic of discussion under thishead, though most of the papers are of opinion that it is not yet time to express anydecided opinion as to its success or failure.   The &quot; Herald &quot; is rather non-committal- &quot; the new scheme appears to be working as smoothly as was to be expected &quot;- butstill harps on its old demand that all supplies should be pooled and rationed.  Thisattitude is in some  degree supported by the &quot; Co-operative News,&quot; and the generaltone of the other papers shows  a somewhat unexpected vein  of carping pessimism.
War Aims.    Apart from the Inter-Allied Conference, attention centres very largely on CountHertlingY recent speech.   It is welcomed by the &quot; Herald &quot; and &quot; Labour Leader &quot;by the former as being singularly moderate &quot; for a war lord flown with insolencea,nd annexation/&apos;1 and by the latter as being &quot; the most  definite  pronouncement vetmade by a spokesman of the German Government.&quot;    Such papers as the &quot; New Statesman &quot; are, however, much less favourable, whilethe &quot; British Citizen &quot; draws particular attention  to  Lord  Miiner&apos;s speech atPlymouth, which it regards as exceedingly important.                            III. DISTRICT REPORTS.London and South-E&apos;astern.    The general situation in this district is still somewhat unsettled.   As regardsthe question of man-power the position is satisfactory.   It was stated,  however, ata meeting of the A.S.E. on Saturday that a notice is shortly to appear in the tradepapers advising members who are called up to return their papers, as they are notliable for military  service.  The meeting subsequently turned its attention to thequestion of overtime, and carried a proposal that this should be abolished during therest of the war.   The Ministry of Munitions reports that at a meeting of a localLabour Advisory Board a speaker who had been on one of the trade unionist visits tothe front acknowledged that he had been completely persuaded of the necessity ofrecruiting skilled men for the Army.    At Woolwich some unrest has arisen owing to the discharge of women workers,and their rumoured replacement by discharged soldiers.  The women  resent this,.though it seems that their grievance is largely aggravated by the fact that the wagesoffered for their work in other directions  is not so high as in their present employ-ment.  At a meeting of the Women&apos;s Party  at Woolwich, on the 27th, referencewas made to this cause of discontent, one of the speakers stating that she  hopedevery able-bodied man at Woolwich would be combed out.    There has also been a certain recrudescence of activity among; the shop stewards,who seem chiefly concerned, however, with such matters as the alleged  prosecutionof M. Litvinoff.    So- far as food is concerned, the situation is quiet, and the rationing  schemeseems to have produced general  satisfaction.South- Western.    From this district some agitation against the continuance of the war  is reported,and at Dorchester the agricultural labourers held two mass meetings, both of  whichwere well attended, and at which they carried resolutions agreeing to do their bestto increase food production, but demanding that the Government should immediatelyenter upon negotiations for peace.    The food situation in this district is reported to be serious, the meat shortagebeing particularly acute.&quot;West Midlands.    Reports from this district are satisfactory.    Excitement as  regards the man-power question has to a large extent subsided,and the A.S.E. are at present fairly quiet, though they have raised objections tothe calling up of two of their members.  Eligible young men in Birmingham are,however, again showing a keen desire to enter  the  technical units of the  army.An important meeting of the Workers&apos;  Union is reported, at which a resolutionwas passed against the A.S.E. being allowed  a separate conference.   Some oppo-sition was, however, evident.    The South Staffordshire and East  Worcestershire  Miners&apos; Association haveexpressed willingness to assist the Government  in obtaining men for militaryservice, on condition  that all men of whatever medical  category who have enteredthe mines since August 1914 are taken first.   A number of women are being dis-missed from the Rudge Whitworth and Triumph Works at Coventry,  a course whichis anticipated at other works.
     Discontent centres chiefly around the food question, which has grown moreserious.  At the  food protest  meeting at Birmingham, mentioned in last  week:sreport,  resolutions were passed demanding that the Government should take overall supplies, institute a system of rationing, and make a drastic reduction in foodprices.  Strong denunciations of profiteering were also made, but the workers wereurged to use only constitutional methods to enforce their demands.  Much satis-faction  is being expressed with the work and personnel of the Birmingham FoodCommittee.   At Coventry it is again the meat shortage which is arousing discontentand is much discussed in the various works.Yorkshire and East Midlands.     The situation in this area is on the whole satisfactory,  and  little unrest isreported.     Opposition to the man-power proposals has apparently to a great extent sub-sided, and the South Derbyshire Miners have  decided in favour of the Governmentby a considerable majority.  Again, the Women&apos;s Party held an enthusiastic meet-ing at Nottingham on the 26th, at which Mrs.  Pankhurst spoke  in strong condemna-tion of  the attitude of the Engineers.   It is also reported that a number of youngengineers are joining up voluntarily, realising that the A.S.E. officials are powerlessto prevent the man-power proposals being carried into effect.  At  Derby, however,the local branch of the A.S.E. has decided  that,  pending instructions  from  theExecutive Council,  members of the branch are to  refuse  to submit themselves tomedical examination.     The Sheffield shop stewards  are  proposing to  hold a national rank and filedelegate conference, to  discuss and decide questions of man-power  and war aims,and are issuing circulars to that  effect.     Discontent is said to be spreading among the woolcombing operators in York-shire again.  The men are proposing to  substitute a  forty-hour week for  one  of55^ hours, but require the same  wages.    This  is in consequence of the restrictedamount of raw material.     No complaints  are  made of the food  situation,  which is said at present to  besatisfactory, and queues have disappeared.North-We stern.    With the exception of the  unrest among the tramworkers,  matters are calm  inthis district.   The situation as  regards  man-power has altered  materially.  AtLiverpool  all is quiet,  but the  shop stewards  are said  to be watching carefully tosee if any skilled man is taken before all  dilutees have been combed out,   This isstill the crux of the matter, and it is thought locally that if the Government willdefinitely guarantee to take ail fit men up  to the age of 32, who have entered thevarious  works since 1914, the problem will be solved.   Among the skilled engineeringtrades there is a distinct feeling that otherwise trouble will ensue.     The activities of the I.L.P. at Liverpool and Barrow referred to last week havebeen continued, while the B.S.P. have held meetings  in the Manchester district,     Complaints  as  regards the food question are less  numerous, but  at Wallaseyand Birkenhead considerable unrest is said to prevail among  the dock hands andmunition workers. owing to the public meals order, which  prevents their obtainingtheir accustomed  quantity of food at tea  time.Northern.     The situation in  this district with regard to the  man-power  proposals is stillsatisfactory, and at a meeting  of the  Tyne and Wear  pattern-makers a resolutionwas passed  pledging the meeting&apos;s support  to the Government  in every way.     Some improvement is reported in &quot;the food  situation, which was recently veryacute, and much larger supplies of meat have been available.South Wales.     Reports from this district are fairly  satisfactory, and only slight  unrest  isreported.  A number of miners  are being  dismissed in Glamorganshire owing  tothe intention of the management to close down the mines.       [1100-19]                                                      C
tScotland.     The Ministry of Munitions regard the situation on the Clyde as better than itlias  been for some months, and reports received from other sources tend to confirmthis view.     Unrest,  clue to  the scheme of closing public houses which is in force, has beenreported.   The workers complain that the public houses are never open at the hourswhen they  are off work, and it is feared that trouble may result unless some systemis set up. by which the public houses remain open on Saturday evenings.     As  regards  man-power, the agitation seems at present to have died  down inthe  Clyde area.   Among the miners, however, the voting is much divided,  but it isthought on the whole to be going against the Government&apos;s proposals.     The Clyde Workers&apos;  Committee are  turning their attention to the abolition ofpayment by results,  and at a meeting on the 2nd  it was proposed that this should beincluded in the propaganda which  is being organised to fight the Government  onthe  man-power  question.     Considerable unrest has arisen in the jute  industry at Dundee on account ofthe  necessary stoppage of machinery due  to  shortage of  materials.  Negotiationshave been  in progress with the Ministry of National Service, and  at a meeting ofemployers  on the 15th February it was unanimously decided to provide unempioy-ment funds.                                      IV. DISPUTES.   (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.        The situation is still satisfactory,  and the number of disputes reported is again   comparatively small.        The Shipyard Labour Department reports 8 new cases of stoppages and 24 old;   in 27 cases work has been resumed.              In  the new stoppages 2,215 men have been involved in all.  The most important           these is a strike of platers at Armstrong, Whitwortlfs, Walker, involving in all 1,213 men,           the grievance  in question being one regarding  allowances  for repair work on new work           executed on shore.   The men have been advised to resume work on condition that negotia-           tions are commenced.   Of the rest, the more important are a strike of joiners at Dumbarton           for the abolition of the system of piecework, which is seriously impeding production  of urgent           war material, and another of 2,050 joiners at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs, Belfast, which           was mentioned last week.   On the 27th February the  men at a mass meeting decided           against  a resumption of work, and the case has now been referred to the Ministry of Labour,           and will be considered further when the new evidence which is to be put in  against the           finding of the  Committee on Production has been  produced.              The electricians in the Clyde area who were last week  reported to be on strike have now           returned to work on agreement that  the arrears of pay due  to munition workers under the           award should be paid, and negotiations continued in respect of the  other men.              The shipwrights who were on strike at  Messrs. Silley, Wen,  and Co., at the  Albert           Docks, over the non-unionist question, returned to work  on the 1st March on the  under-           standing that all non-union men should join the union within six weeks.        The Ministry of Munitions reports  that a  total  of 2,377 workpeople were   involved in strikes during the week ending the 27th February.    Of these about half   were involved in stoppages  which  occurred in the West Midlands.              Eight strikes were still in progress at the end of the week, but these are said to be of a           trivial character.              Several strikes have occurred at aviation factories in the London district.  One of these           occurred at the Faery Aviation Co., where 600 employees struck work on the 28th February           as a protest against the action of a supeiwisor, who  had found fault with one of the girls for           &quot; slacking,&quot; and in consequence had  an altercation with a forewoman, who was eventually           dismissed.   The firm refused to consider the demands of the workers for  the supervisor^           dismissal.  The matter is now,  however, being investigated, and work was  resumed on the           4th March.              A  somewhat serious strike  of moulders  employed by firms in West  Bromwich and           Oldbury, arising out of a claim to be  paid the Birmingham district  rate, has involved some           500 men.   The men were induced to return &apos;to work on the 1st March, and the dispute has           been referred to arbitration.              Another strike is now reported at  an aeroplane works at Park Boyal, involving 500 men.        Five new strikes are reported  by the Coal Controller, in addition to two strikes   which have alreadjr  been mentioned.    The number of men involved was rather more&apos;   than 5,000, but  in three cases the men  have already resumed work.              An  affair at the Pleasley Colliery, Derbyshire,  is unfortunately too typical of  much  of           the prevailing unrest.   Owing to the prosecution of *a boy for the intimidation of  another,           all the boys stopped work, and involved some 1,700 men employed in the colliery.
            Considerable unrest is reported  in Lanarkshire,  where there  have recently  been  a        number of short stoppages of work for only unimportant causes.     JSTo new stoppages are  reported this week by the War Office Contracts Depart-ment.            The strike at Messrs.  Bichard  Green&apos;s, Cradley Heath, still  continues,  as the  men        ceased work for a second time owing to some queries raised by the firm as to the amount of        increase to be paid.            The strike of enginemen at Blackburn has now been settled, and work has been resumed.(b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.     Thirty-three new  controversial cases are reported  by  the  Shipyard  LabourDepartment.            In 88 cases settlements have been achieved during the week, a number which consider-        ably reduces the&apos;178 cases  which  were still  pending at the  beginning of the week.  In the        Birmingham area  it is  reported that  serious trouble  is likely  to ensue at Messrs. J. G.        Walker  and  Sons, unless   arrangements  are  made  to  supply the  men with  a  certain        quantity of beer  while  at work.   Trouble is also threatened at  Messrs. Vickers, Barrow,        among certain of the general workers, who object  to the  employment of a non-unionist.     The Ministry of Munitions mentions a dispute regarding the payment of awardsat Messrs. Taylor  and Sons, Briton Ferry, which  involved  the  question  of  shopstewards.            The firm made a strong  stand against what they  regard as the unconstitutional action of        the shop stewards, and  at a conference between  the firm and the workers&apos; representatives        it was finally agreed that in future all correspondence should be sent direct through union        officials to the employers&apos; association.            Strikes from all over the count-rj are threatened by  about 80,000  tramway workers,        who are demanding an advance of  1  per week over pre-war pay as a  national settlement.        A conference  at Leicester resolved to  tender seven days&apos; notice,  expiring on the 9th, unless        this demand is conceded, and the matter is now being dealt with by the Ministry of Labour.            There is a prospect of  serious trouble arising at Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, Ltd.,        Leeds,  where, owing  to the completion  of  contracts,  some  1,200  employees have been        dismissed.            No  bad feeling has so  far been shown  by the  workers, though many are still  out of        work.   The firm has,  however, been  reported to  intend to  supplement  its  staff by further        diluted labour, and the A.S.E. tin-eaten in this  event to withdraw all their  members in the        firm&apos;s employ.     Two new controversial  cases are reported by  the  Coal Controller.            In one of these the winding enginemen at the New Hucknall Collieries, Nottingham, have        threatened to strike for an  advance of Is. per day on the rates laid down in  an  award of        December 1916.  Both  owners and men hold that the rates in the  award were minimum        rates,  and could be advanced without the sanction of  any Government Department.   The        wording of the award does  not, however,  support this view.     The War Office Contracts Department   has  two new  controversial  cases  toreport.            One of these is a dispute in the clothing  trade for an advance of 25 &quot;per cent, on current        wages,  on account of which the Garment Workers&apos; Union threaten a general strike.    The        masters made a proposal, which was rejected by the  men at a conference at  Manchester,        and further discussion was postponed until after the London meeting, which took place on        the 1st March.            Another demand for an increase of wages has been received from their foundry employees        by Messrs.  Gillespie and Co., Bonnybridge.   The men are now claiming 50 per cent.        increase, and appear to be somewhat restive,  though  no strike has as yet occurred.     The Chief Industrial Commissioner  reports about 210  differences during  theweek,  of which 95  are claims  for the 12^ per cent, bonus, and 85  of the total fallwithin the engineering and  shipbuilding group.            In Dublin a general sympathetic  strike of bakers was threatened, owing to the refusal        of one firm to allow the claims of  their employees to be  referred to arbitration.   The strike-        was, however, finally averted when the Food  Control Department had taken over the firm.     The Committee on Production report that 23 arbitration cases  have been heardin London and 8  in Scotland during the past week.                                                             D.  J.
