(This  Document is the  Property ofHis  Britannic fv*ajesty&apos;s  Government.)E 12f Per Cent.  BONUS  TO  TIMEWORKERS  AND       PARALLEL QUESTIONS  IN FRANCE.    In view of the discussion  which, has taken place on  the  policy of  the 12i percent, bonus to time workers, it will be of interest to the Cabinet to see what the Frenchpractice has been.  It will be observed that they have  made  even larger advancesproportionately to the skilled men and  the  timeworkers,  and have succeeded inexcluding the bulk of the pieceworkers from the grant.  In fact, they have followedin practice the  same policy as was adopted and  urged by the Ministry of Munitions.The scale of their advance is, however, larger.  .                                               WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.     It is not only in England  that the conditions imposed  on industry  by the warhave produced the &quot;skilled rnens  grievance.&quot;  In France, too, repetition work on agreat scale has created a serious disproportion  between the earnings of semi-skilledand  unskilled pieceworkers and those of skilled timeworkers.  In both countries  theresult has been unrest and  unsatisfactory  work among the  skilled men.   In bothsimilar remedies  have been  applied, though the contrasts  in methods  and details.isfrequently striking.     The reduction of piece-rates has  been forbidden, as  in England, except whenchanges in the method of manufacture justify changes in rates.  The rights  of piece-workers in this respect are amply safeguarded.     Action was taken on the claims  of skilled  timeworkers much  earlier in Francethan in England,  and from a different  starting-point.   On 16th  January 1917.M. Thomas, in a  decision for Paris, which is the chief seat of repetition work  and ofits problems, laid down the general principle that skilled men who cannot be put onpiece must be given a compensating bonus.  It was the duty of the  French LabourRegulation Department (Le Service de la main  d&quot;o3Uvre  au Ministere  de VArmemeni)to see to the carrying out of the decision.  The principle was elaborated by the Comite,de  Co7iciliation in  an Avis  dated 28th February.   In a later  Avis of  the  Comite(28th June), which was formally approved by M. Thomas  (30th June), the claims oftoolroom men were specifically mentioned.   On 22nd July M. Thomas, in a ministerialletter, instructed  the  Controleur de la main d&quot;ceuvre at Paris to urge on employersthe  claims of the  &quot; maintenance men of the engineering trade,&quot; viz.: &quot; fitters, turners,smiths, boilermakers, &amp;c.&quot;   Thus  the signal was given  for the piecemeal settlementof the question by agreement between the parties.     Action for the Paris district was completed by a decision (November 30th) witheffect from 1st September.  In pursuance of an arbitrative decision of the Paris Comitede Conciliation (20th  September) bonuses  of from 15 to  45  centimes per hour weregiven to various classes of skilled men (professionels).   Expressed as percentages ofthe  minimum guaranteed rate per  hour these bonuses range from 13 * 6 per cent, to40  per cent.   The  departments  included were smelting, rolling mills, forge, hotstamping, and the classes of  workmen, for  example, smelters, pourers, lifters,  rollers,drawers, sectional iron men, straighteners,  cleaners, holders-up,  steam-hammermen,pressmen, stampers, diesinkers.   The only engineers mentioned are those engaged on the machines for these departments.     It is noteworthy that  skilled men in the engineering shops  proper are  notmentioned, their  case  having  already been met under the declarations  of  policydescribed above.   It  is also to be noted that the question of bonuses for crucible menwas reserved pending the issue of  negotiations between  the parties before the Comite de Conciliation, and that all future demands for similar bonuses were ordered to bereferred to the Comite.     On October  15th a decision of M. Loucheur gave a bonus of 20 per cent,  to skilled timeworkers in  various departments  at Belfort and Montbeliard.   This decision  was based on an agreement between the parties.   The departments covered were general engineering, electricians, steelworks, rolling mill, boiler-making, sheet metal, foundry and maintenance.  Among the  last were included masons,  plasterers, slaters, painters, lock-makers, saddlers, joiners, wheelwrights.     ,i  (33^)5254  Pk 25  125 3/18  E &amp; S
     On 4th. February 1918 a bonus of 20 per cent,  was given to skilled  timeworkers in the important industrial district or St. Etieime, Roanne, and Charlieu.  This decision covers the departments included at Paris and Belfort, and, in addition, springs,  files, and tinsmiths.   v  Other decisions are in preparation.     The  bonuses have  not  been extended  to labourers, nor has auy advance  been given in  compensation to  pieceworkers.   The men&apos;s bonus, however,  in Paris at least, is paid, with the deduction of 10 centimes per hour, to women  on  skilled  work at time-rates.  The  Paris decision also enjoins the revision  of piece rates which  leave the pieceworkers worse off than the timeworkers who get a bonus.     Thus,  the original French policy  was  enunciated  several  months before the Munitions Act of 1917 gave  powers to deal by statutory order with timeworkers&apos; rates.   By  the date of Order  1061,  which  synchronised closely  with,  the Belfort decision (15th October), the principle of extending the  bonuses to other classes of skilled men than toolmakers and maintenance men in the engineering  trade proper had already been established in the Paris conciliation of 20th September.     It  is remarkable  that  though the French policy dates much farther back, the bonuses have not been extended to semi-skilled  or  unskilled timeworkers or to piece- workers.     No general solutions of wages questions are attempted in France.  All decisions take the  closest account  of the circumstances  of each  claim.  At  the  outset of the war, wages questions were  settled  locally under the supervision of the  u Inspection des Forges,&quot; an organisation which for many  years past had  represented  the  con- tracting departments, mainly on the  technical  side, in the chief industrial districts. In July 1915 M. Thomas appointed local controllers to relieve  the inspectors of all labour questions.  The regime of the Controllers lasted till January 1917, when the prevalence of  unrest obliged M. Thomas to  make  certain changes, the  chief being the institution of Gomites de conciliation et  d&apos;arbitrage for each industrial district. These Comites are  not confined to the  metal trades.  The Ministere de VArmement may enunciate a general policy, but the  details are  left to the  trades in the various localities  to  settle in  accordance with  local conditions.   When the parties   have agreed  on the details, the Ministere de VArmement  gives  their agreement executive force.   This is the normal method.  Thus, cost-of-living advances have been  strictly regional throughout  the war, and in practically  all  important centres these -advances have been graded by reference to earnings, dependents, and other family circumstances, e.g., disablement.    Owing  to an elastic  and decentralised  system and to the close supervision  of industry by a staff  of  competent  local controllers,  the French  are able to settle questions  as and where they  arise.   They have no  regular  or national  cycles  of advances such as are recognised by the Committee on Production.    The functions  of the Ministere du  Travail (M. of L.) have  been taken over, sofar as regards all work on munitions, by the Ministere de VArmement.    An interdepartmental Committee, representing  all the departments  which  haverelations  with labour,  has been set up.    On this  Committee the Ministere deVArmement has the leading voice.
