Tho Committee, appointed by ^ar Cabinet 359, Minute 10, werefaced with two alternatives :-    (a) To requisition immediately the Dutch Tonnage now lying idle        in United States Ports, amounting to some 400,000 tons.    (b) To give the Dutch Government one more chance of completing        the agreement, which they have been considering for the pasj*        9 weeks, whereby we should obtain the use of their vessels,        not wanted for thoir own purposoa, in waters outside the        war zone.     In the course of discussion the following reasons were putforward against (a) and in favour of (b) :-1.  If now without any warning we were to break off the negotiationsin regard to the agreement, it would be difficult to defend ouraction before public opinion In Holland and in other HeutralCountries, especially Sweden.    We should be in a much stronger position if we gave the Dutchiwtice that, unless they ratify the agreement by a certain date,we should then requisition their tonnage.2.   If we break off negotiations without warning, the Dutch mightretaliate by hampering our imports of Margarine, Borneo Oil, etc.     They could increase the flow of agricultural produco intoGermany.     They might create difficulties in connection with BelgianBelief by withholding shipments of    at.   They might even makesome sort of terms with the Germans as to the use of Dutch ports.3.   We stand to gain rather more tonnage under the agreement thanwould be obtained by requisition.   On the other hand the vesselsobtained under the agreement would only be employable outside thewar zone.   It is therefore important that our position as to warzone areas should be safeguarded in view of the possibility of theGermans declaring all waters to be in the war zone.     It should be clearly    stipulated in the agreement  that &quot;safe&quot;waters are those that were safe at the time when&quot; the agreement wasfirst proposed.     In view of those considerations the Committee decided that       The Dutch Government should be given one final chance cf         ratifying the agreement.       In tho event., however,  of their failing to do so by Mondfty,         Harch 11th, the date  of the first meeting of the Allied         Maritime Transport Council, wo should encourage  our         American, French, and Italian colleagues on that Council         to agree to the requisitioning of the ships *       Lord Robert Cecil undertook to instruct Sir W. Townlty in         that sense.(Initialled)   U,2 ^Thitehall Gardens, 3.W.,      6th March, 1918.
