ET.Department of Information,       ETW/002.WEEKLY  REPORT  OH  TtfolvEY . &amp;  QTH2H  MOSLEM  CCUHTRtES.  II.                  (March 6th, 1918)Chief recent developments.      1.  Feb. 24th;  Constantinople announces occupation of                      Trebizcnd.      2.  Feb. 26%h:  An inspired statement from Tokio f*re-                      aha-dews Japanese intervention in Siberia.      3.  Feb.  6th:  Sir C Marling telegraphs from Teheran                      suggesting military intervention in                      N. 17, Persia.      4.  March 3rd:  Berlin announces occupation of Kiev.   These developments taken together affect the entire situationin Asia.   Germany, Tufekay and Japan are in process of extendingtheir power, by a combination of military and political methodsY$ver the area of the former Russian Emoire;  and at the same mo-ment the imminent viotory of the anti-Entente elements in Persiathreatens to debar Great Britain, from intervening in these criti-cal events, ^and to confine our influence on the Asiatio continentwithin the Indian frontier and our military lines in Mesopotamiaand Palestine.   This may be no more than a momentary phase, butit is perhaps more unfavourable f$r British interests in Asia thanany phase since the beginning of the war.The Turkish Advance.   After the occupation of Trebizond by Turkish troops, announcedon Feb. $4th, came the statement from Petrograd that the cession6&quot;f the Kars-Ardahan-Batum district (annexed  fry  Russia  frpaTurkey in 1878) was one of the new demands added to the Germanconditions of peace.   The rumour to this effect, mentioned inlast,week&apos;s Report, is thus confirmed.
   If they advance uo to the frontier-line of 1878, the Turkswill be able to establish direst contact with the AzerbaijaniTatars of Trans-Caucasia and the Jangalis in the Persian nrovinceff Gilan.   Hothing stands in their way except the embryonieGeorgian and Armenian national armies.   The published terms ofthe Central Powers give these nationalities every reason forfighting, but it is impossible to judge how far they are in aposition to do S3.   The failure of General Dunsterville&apos;smilitary mission to make their way further North than Kasvin isa serious military,, lo3s to Trans * Caucasia.   Unless a militaryr$ute can be opened across l.V7.?ersia from Bagdad to Tiflis, itseems inevitable that the Georgians and Armenians should be sub-merged by the advance of the Turkish troops and the rising ofthe Kurds and Tatars,The Anti-Entente Movement in Persia.   On Peb, 25th it was reported that fighting had broken out be-tween the Assyrian (Nestorian Christian) Volunteers, who are be-ing organised at Urmia by British and ex-Russian offioers, andthe Persian Cossaoks stationed in that town.    On the Cossacks*s side, two Russian officers and severalPersian troopers were killed.   The Assyrians accused theRussians of being German agents.   This outbreak, oc-ourrLrig simul-taneously with the Turkish advance and following on the dissatis-faction produced among Moslems by the raising sf Christian troopsin N.VJ,Persia under Entente leadership, has createa a dangerousstate pf tension throughout the Persian province of Azerbaijan.The Julfa-Tabriz Saiwway has been attacked by bands, and thepersonnel are evacuating it,   Resht is in the hands of the Jangalis and the disbandedRussian  troops.   Bath are anti-British - the Jahgalis as Llcsiems
    rI                             -  3 -    and  Persians,  the  auesians  as Bolsheviks,  on  the  ground  that  we    are  trying  to  assist  the  Commissariat  of Tran3-Caucasia  wMch is    an anti-Bolshevik  government.    Their  action  entirely isolates    Trans-Caucasia from us.      Harch 2nd the Persian Cossaj&amp;ks at    Resht gave  the Jangalis their rifles and equipment,  apparently    with the  oonnivanoe of the  Russian officers in  com-nand.   The    Jangalis  are threatening  to advance on Kasvin,      Meanwhile the political  situation is becoming  more critical    at Teheran.  The Goxrernment resigned because  it found itself  un-    able to meet both  British requirements and Persian publio opinion.    ^blio opinion is  rapidly growing  more violent, and it seems  as    though demonstrations and threats  of terrorism  would make it  im-    tossible  f*r any government not unfriendly to Creat Britain to    take offioe, without  the  support of British troops.(4)   Russian Central Asia.      On Bee.  6th, 1917, the Bolshevik Government  at petrograd sent    out  a wireless, calling on  Moslems in  Russia, and also in other    European  emoires,  to  exercise the  right of self-determination.      On Bee  23rd, 1917, a  special Moslem Congress  assembled at    Tashkend  and proclaimed the independence of Russian Turkestan.    Kokand  in Perghane^ was chosen  &quot;as  the  seat of goveramen-t,  and a    ministry  was appointed consisting  of six Meslems  and a Jewish    Chancellor  af  the  Sxchoquer.       Telegrams,  dated Fob.  21 and 23, from the  British Consul at    Kashgar to  the Viceroy of India and the Minister  at Pekin re-    spectively, give the  information that  the former  Russian ofifioials    are  carrying on under the new regime and thafr the Russian    garrison  are virtually prisoners.       The  Consul  adds that  the Austrian prisoners  of war are unaer    control.  On the other hand Sir C Marling reoorts that  parties    of them are arriving  in Persia.
     The new autonomous state nominally remains part of theRussian Federation, hut there is a fanatical party, lr*d by the:&apos;ollohst which is working for the severance oi the connectionwith Russia and the establishment of a separate Central  siaticMoslem federation.   The same division of parties appeared inBokhara early in the Revoluticn.   The Khanates of Khiva and Bokhara were autonomous under theold Regime and have been virtually independent since the verybeginning of the Revolution.   They are not included in the newTurkestan, n^r is the Siemiryechensk District, East sf LakeBalkash.   This latter distriot, where the expropriation of the nativeMoslems in favour of Russian settlers was being pushed withparticular energy under the (Fsardom, is presumably assigned tothe Kirghiz.   The Kirghiz, who extend scress the stepoes fr*m Lake Balkashto the lower Volga, ore also organising as autonomous Kirghiz-iston, though they are more backward than most other RussianMoslems (being still in a semi-nomadic state) and had till ro-cently advanced no further than a &quot;Cadet&quot; programme.   The line taken by the Kirghiz is worth watching, because theyare the strongest group numerically among the Russian Moslems(nearly five millions), and are the geographical link betweenthose of European Russia and Turkestan.Bre-fik-down of the &quot;All-Russian&quot; Moslem Hovrmcnt.   In the last Report it was mentioned that the &quot;Ail-Russian&quot;Moslem Movement, which aimed at collecting the 19.000.000 Moslemsof the former Russian Empire into a single political bloek withina united Russian State, appeared to be resolving itself into ascheme for the culture 1 autonomy of the Volga-Ural Tatars withoutincluding the Crimeans, Caucasians or Central Asiatics.
(I- 5 -   This scheme was worked out in great detail by an &quot;Autonomy-Commission&quot; established at Ufa as y result fsf the ,\11-RussianUoslem Conference at Kazan in August 1917.   On Deo. 3rd 1917 itwas ratified by a national assembly, - nd the other Ms siem andTuranian groups in Russia were notified ef the event.   It ischaracteristic that a proposal to notify the Ottoman Turks alsowas both brought forward and voted down.   The scheme wa3 singularly moderate.   . Local branches nf theorganisation were already forming, and subscriptions were comingin, when the ne^s arrived that the Bashkirs, who constitute thelargest and the only compact element in the Volga-Ural group (morethan S millions out$fof five) had proclaimed the territorialautonomy of Bashkiristan.   The assembly thereuoon decided to carry out the culturalautonomy scheme without the co-operation of the Bashkirs, but tochange its headquarters from Ufa to Kazan (the traditional centreof Moslem culture on the Volga).   The scheme will still embracemore than 2 million Tatars in Ve Volga provinces and WesternSiberia who are too scattered to form political units of theirown, and must in any oaoe remain within the Russian State;  butthey will not be strong enough to take the lead among the 16million other Russian Moslems who have now organised themselvesinto compact, politically autonomous territorial entities.   Theterritorial autonomy of Bashkiristan marks the defeat of the &quot;AllRussian&quot; policy and the victory of/the local movements.  It re-mains to be seen whether the new autonomous states retain theirconnection with Russia, declare their separate independence ,  or                              Xform an independent federation.^------------------------------------------------------------- In the telegram of Feb. 23rd from the British Consul at Kazan,  itis stated that a ,:Eoyalist&quot; (Cadet?) newspaper in Turkestan wasappealing to the Bashkirs &quot;not to desert the Russian Federationwhich they had agreed to join&quot;.
   The Bashkir orovisifcnal government established itself atOrenburg,  where there was a Moslem garrison which gave it suboort.This garrisih must have taken bOssession of Orenburg after thoBolsheviks had dispersed the forces of General Dutov, Hetmah ofthe Orenburg Cossacks, who was previously holding the town.  Nodoubt the breaking of the Orenburg Coss-1 ck3&apos; power made the oro-clamation of Bashkir autonomy possible.   By holding Orenburg the Bashkirs secure contact with the au-tonomous states cf Kirghizistan and Turkestan via the OrenburgTashkend Railway (unless the reeorts that it is out of workingurder are true).  The Trans-Siberian Railway also traversesBashkiristan betvreen Samara and the Urals.   If, therefore, theBashkir Government gains effective control over the territory itclaims (which is not certain, for there are large Russian  settle- ments there), the Russian population  in Siberia will be isolatedby an autonomous Moslem belt from the  Russians Ih Europe,  unlessthey can still use the Tinmen-Yekaterinburg-Berm railway.   The autonomy of Bashkiristan is thus important in view  of theproposed intervention of  Japan from the Eastern terminus of theTrans-Siberian line.
