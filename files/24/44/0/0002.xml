Confidential.I^ABOUR  POSITION  IN  MUNITION  INDUSTRIES.                       (27th  February  1918.)    I circulate the following notes which, have been prepared  in the Intelligence andStatistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the  labour position in munitionsindustries.                                                  WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.                                    SUMMARY.                                         I.    The percentage of possible time lost through strikes on munition work in the week ending the 20thFebruary was the lowest  recorded since the week ending  the 12th December 1917.  It. amounted  toone twenty-fifth of one per cent, or to no more than the loss of one day in eight years.                                        II.    Arrangements have been made by the Ministry of Munitions for mobilising ex-army munition workersin the event of invasion.                                        III.    Nearly 500 discharged soldiers  are being trained for munition  work in  36 training centres uuder thegenerel  supervision of the Ministry of  Munitions.   About  1,600 former soldiers have been placed inmunition factories at the close of their training.                                         IV.    After a period of suspicion and  distrust, the  welfare work of the Ministry is being regarded moreappreciatively both by employers and by workpeople. On the part of the workers  there is a desire to beassociated with the practical working of the system.                                   I.-STRIKES.     If stoppages of work in munition factories  be taken as a criterion, the laboursituation  is abnormally peaceful.   The number  of  strikers at the end of the weekending  the 20th February was 772 ;  the  total number of strikers during the weekwas 2,588.  The number of  working days lost during the week was 6,789* as against29,034 in the preceding week.  The percentage  of  total working  days lost  throughstrikes was about ^5-th of 1 per cent.     This is the lowest record  since the beginning  of  the year.  The highest was inthe first week of the year, when the percentage of lost days was just over one-third of1 per cent.              II.-MOBILISATION  OP RELEASED  SOLDIERS.     If  the  country  should be invaded not, perhaps, a  very probable  event thereleased soldiers at work in munition factories might form a valuable element in thedefensive forces.    Arrangements  for  their immediate mobilisation  in  case of  anemergency have been made in the Ministry of  Munitions at the request of the WarUffice.  The scheme includes (1) soldiers released from  the colours, and  (2) soldierstransferred to the  Reserve.   The necessary arrangements are made and kept up to dateby a special branch of the Release from the Colours Section.     Cards are issued to employers for eveiy man concerned, giving particulars of theman and the military depot  to  which  he has to  proceed.   To  each card  a railwaywarrant is attached.  Cards and  warrants are  preserved  in safe  custody,  and  nomention of the arrangement is made  to  the men.   Should  an emergency arise, atelegram (in  a prescribed form) will be sent to  the employers. . Each of the men willthen be handed  his card and railway warrant, for  which he will sign a receipt, andhe will be instructed to proceed as quickly as possible to the military depot.  If he    * These figures would be even more favourable were it not for the inclusion  of a strike of glassworkers.at Ci-atesliead, where the work done is only remotely munitions work.     a  (33)526(5 Pk 20 125  3/18  E &amp; S
can do this without making use of the railways,  the  employer is asked to give anyassistance possible, e.g., by providing  motor transport.  Any refusal to accept a cardand sign a receipt is to be reported at once.  As soon as the instructions have beencarried out, a  telegram  (again in  a prescribed form) is to be  despatched  to  theMinistry.    The number of men  included in  the scheme is increasing daily, and revision ofthe list and the issue of a new card are involved whenever a man changes his employ-ment.  As many of the men have seen service  overseas, they will prove,  in the eventof an emergency, a valuable addition to the Home Forces.           III.-THE TRAINING  OP DISCHARGED  SOLDIERS.    Discharged soldiers  have been trained  by the Ministry of Munitions from thefirst, though in the early days there were probably very few in the training centres.    Last  year an arrangement was concluded with the Ministry of  Pensions underwhich this part of the work is now performed by the Ministry of Munitions.  The menare recommended for training in the first instance by the local Pensions Committee,and are then interviewed either at the training  schools themselves or at headquarters.Probably 30 per cent, at least are rejected at  this stage  as unsuitable in many casesbecause of serious physical disability or shell-shock.  Only such men are accepted asseem  likely to become  munition workers as quickly as other  persons accepted fortraining.    Most of the men are trained as machine hands or fitters, but  efforts  are made todiscover employment  for  them  in other occupations  connected with  munitions foundry work, for example, and  woodwork, and oxy-acetylene welding.   This last isparticularly suitable for men who are unable to stand, and 50  per cent, of the accommo-dation available for training welders is now reserved for ex-Service men.    As might be expected, these students vary greatly in aptitude and temperament.Occasionally there have  been disciplinary difficulties.   As to these, the withholdingof a certain amount  of maintenance allowance at the end of a course has proved  auseful corrective. Empkwers generally are sympathetic.  Difficulties arise as a rule inthe shop itself, and are attributable mainly to the attitude of union men,  and to someextent to slackness and bad timekeeping on the part of the ex-Service men themselves.Discharged soldiers  are a rather difficult class of workers, but the care  taken inpreliminary selection goes far to prevent unsatisfactory results.    Of the 50 training centres under the general supervision of the Ministry, 36 areeither actually training  ex-Service men or are  prepared  to do so.  The  trainingcentres  in the Birmingham area  have perhaps  done more  than  any others,  specialuse being made  of the foundries for training men as moulders.  The Loughboroughcentre has the largest number of  men in training at any one  time (about 70); thenumbers in other centres vary from two or three upwards.    At present there are rather less than 1,000 men in training.  Of these practically50 per cent, are ex-Service men,  and the numbers are increasing.  Figures showingthe total number of men of this class who have passed through the training schoolscannot be  given with certainty, as at first there was no differentiation between ex-Service men and others.  It  is estimated, however, that  since the 1st January  1917not less than  2,000 ex-Service  men  have  been  accepted under  the  Ministry  ofMunitions  scheme, and it is  known that 80 per cent, of these have been placed invarious munition factories.                  IV. PROGRESS IN WELFARE WORK.    The Welfare work of the Ministiy was  at first looked  at  askance-by manyemployers, to whom  it seemed philanthropy not related  directly to  business, andby many workers, who feared  it as machinery for &quot; speeding up &quot; in the interest ofoutput.   If it cannot be said  that  these misconceptions have disappeared completely,it is at least certain that they have diminished enormously and are still diminishing.One welfare  officer reports of the employers in his district  (Yorkshire  and EastMidlands): &quot; On the whole, firms seem to look upon welfare supervisors as necessaryevils.&quot;  It is at least a gain that they regard  them as  necessary; and the officercontinues: &quot; They are beginning to realise  the  amount of trouble the managementmay be saved by them.&quot;
     On the side of the workers the change of attitude  is agreeably illustrated in avaluable memorandum prepared by the Joint  Committee of  the  Woolwich Tradesand Labour  Council and  the Woolwich Labour Party.  This  memorandum,  to  areprint of which the  Woolwich Pioneer^  (22nd February 1918) devotes an entirepage,  relates mainly to the  Welfare Supervision Department of  the Arsenal,  butit also takes a wider view, glancing back at the first beginnings of welfare  work inthis county, and ranging  over the entire field  covered by the memoranda of  theHealth of Munition  Workers&apos; Committee.     Of the Welfare Department the writers say that in spite of its short existence (ithas been in active existence about two years) its work &quot; has been tremendous in scope&quot; and carried out, on the whole, in a real spirit of  understanding of the needs of the&quot; workers.&quot;   This frank and cordial expression of appreciation is followed by a seriesof suggestions as to conditions which should be realised in order to command the fullconfidence  and support of the workers.   The  suggestions, which contemplate that&quot; welfare supervision will probably become a permanent and extending element of the&quot; industrial system,&quot; have reference  chiefly to a  share  of the workers in the systemof control, the recognition of trade unions and  trade union standards, and the holdingof local welfare conferences under the auspices of trade unionism and labour.Hostels.     There are now 570 hostels in the country  for the housing of munition workers men, women, and boys.  The Government own 243 ot: these hostels, and 327 belongto religious and charitable societies and private firms.     The total housing  capacity is about 44,000 workers, 27,000 of these being women,and fully two-thirds of the  accommodation is occupied.     The charges have  been increased lately, but  they compare very favourably  withlocal charges for lodgings.  The average amounts paid weekly are 18s. 7d. per head formen  and 14s.  Sd. for  women, while the  corresponding amounts paid hj those inlodgings are 22s. 4d. and 16s. 2d.     There are in all 29 hostels which have been established by private firms for theirown workers.  A trade union leader who. at the request of the Welfare Section, sent aconsidered statement of trade union opinion on  hostels, expressed the fear that thelinking of hostels to factories would bring the workers  under the control  of the firmduring the whole of the 24 hours and might lead to the revival of the truck system.   * A weekly newspaper eouducted in the Labour interest.  On the industrial side it is concerned mainlywith the engineering and allied trades.
