NOTE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF OH           LEHORAKBUll T.21169 OF THE 7th MARCH,            C EMULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN                              AFFAIRS. (G.T.3840) .  151/422.     The Secretary cf State fcr Foreign Affairs asks the GerejalStaff to consider the effect of German access to Odessa, thepossibility $f the enemy transporting troops aoress the Blaolc Seafrom Odessa to Bat cum and thence to Baxu, and the effect of thesepossible developments on our military- action in Palestine or M^rthwest Persia,     I de net conceive that the presence of Germans in Odessa-willhave very material effect upon immediate or future developments inthe Hear&quot;East.  The Russian fleet having entirely succumbed toBolshevism, the Germans for a long time past have had access tothree parts, Constansa, Varna, and Constantinople, giving themaccess to the Black Sea.  Either Constansa &amp;r Constantinople wouldserve the enemy better as a base for enterprises in the Caucasusthan would Odessa.  I do not consider therefore that the possibi-lity of the Germans getting to Odessa has materially affected thesituation, but what hefi affected it is the continued break up ofRussia and the spread of Bolshevism in the Caucasus, with theresult that it is now easier for the Germane than it was to get afooting in Caucasia, while it is becoming hourly more difficultfor us to do so*  These are developments which have been long fore-seen by the General Staff who pressed as long ago as last Octoberfor Entente action in Armenia, have been pressing for an evenlonger period for Japanese action in Siberia, and, in vie?/ of sucheventualities as are hinted at by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, advised that our forces in Mesopotamia should notbe reduced to the extort proposed by General Smuts, but should bemaintained at a strength, sufficient to enable us to exert ourinfluence effectively on the Persian frontier.     2*  It is necessary to take a wide view of the situation inorder to appreciate its dangers.         Germany went into this war with the object of makingherself the dominant world power..  To gain this object sherequired first facilities for naval expansion in Western Europesuch as would enable her to contest on at least equal termsBritish supremacy on the sen.  Secondly, she aimed at establishingcomplete control over Central Europe and the Hear East with a viewto expansion eastwards *         It seems certain that Germany has not yet abandoned theattainment of these objects but the course of the war has alteredthe methods of attainment.  It is improbable that she still hopesfor such a sweeping success in the West as would give her controlof the Butch and Belgian coasts and of the French channel ports!                                                         but
but ff her full scheme of sea development is unlikely to  berealised it is far from probable that she has abandoned italtogether.  She still has hopes that the U boat will improveher maritime position, and the recent capture of the Balticand of the B&amp;ack Sea will almost certainly give a fillipto her ambitions in this direction.  Our answer is to destroythe U*.boat.   3, As regards her second object ^ Germany^ originalprogramme was almost certainly to first moke herself para-mount in the Balkans, and then cut us off from our shortestline to India by establishing herself at the head of thePersian Gulf and in Egypt.  She now finds herself debarredfrom the Persian Gulf and from Egypt , but the collapse cfRussia has opened to her a new and more northerly road tothe East by the Black Sea, the Caucasus and the Caspian.If she succeeds in dominating Russia effectively she willhave secured the northern flank of this line of advance andmay even hope&apos; ultimately to develop a new 1 drang nach osten&apos;,which will place her eventually on the shores of the pacific.   4,  At present the difficulties of communication betweenMesopotamia and North-west Persia, and the spread ofBolshevism in Trans-Caucasia, threaten to out us off evenfrom the Caspian, and make it increasingly doubtful whetherwe shall be able to get our agents into Armenia,  It ishighly probable that Germany will at once take advantageof this situation.  It was reported on the 19th Februarylast that the Russians were.evacuating Batwum, and, therefore,enemy parties would meet with no opposition at that port.It is unlikely that for scans time, to come Germany will beable to place any considerable bodies of troops in this area,but we may expect a very highly organised propaganda backedby German officers and small parties of German Jroops whowill do everything that the wit of man can suggest to under^mine our power in the East.    5.  The first practical steps which we may expect Germanyto take will be               *    (a) To reorganise agriculture and the railway systems        in Southern Russia.&apos;        &apos;    (b) To organise and exploit the western Black Sea        ports.  It is to be noted that Constanza, by the        terms of peace with Roura&amp;nia, falls to Hungary        and not to Bulgaria.    (c) Establish agents and small, parties of German        officers and men in the eastern Black Sea ports.    (d) Take such steps as they cap to establish German        influence in Caucasia,    (e) Stretch out by rail, road and sea, and get into        the closest possible touch with the real East and        gradually drive ua out from Mesopotamia and Persia.    6.  Our answer to this must be to establish an effectivebarrier to German progress eastwards.  Our interests aremore vitally affected than those of any other of the EntentePowers, but if Germany&apos;o Eastern ambitions are realised theytoo will not be unaffected.  We must&quot;endeavour to get them,and particularly America, to understand this and induce themat once to encourage and support Japanese intervention in                                                    Siberia.
Siberia.  President Wilson appears at present to regard thequestion of Japanese intervention as an abstract politicalpufsblem rather than as on urgent and practical., militarynecessity.  It is urgent that we should clear Ms mind onthis matter.  Without some such support from Japan our own affnx-t-scan hardly be successful.  The only effective bases from whichwe can work in the last are kesopotamia and India, and suchefforts as we can make from both of these may, and probablywill be ineffectual  if wo leave Germany free to turn our flankby the north at her leisure.  Our immediate answer therefore  tothe dangers which German access through Russia to the Eastopen up are     (i) To get Japan to join at oncea and to act with         the greatest possible energy and with the greatest         possible strength.     (ii) To continue our pressure in Palestine and maintain         our position in Mesopotamia.   (iii) To stretch out from Baghdad into North-West         Persia and on a foundation of organised military         strength between Baghdad and the Caspian build         up local organisations and work our way into the         Canvasus with the firm intention of winning over         Armenia, and making our influence predominate on         tho eastern ports of the Black Sea.    (iv) To be certain of anticipating German agents and         propaganda in Turkestan by sending out military         missions at once from India into that country,    7. X desire to press upon the War Cabinet my convictionthat unless immediate action on the above lines is takenwe run a grave risk of permitting the Germans to establishthemselves in a position which will eventually lead to thodownfall of our Eastern Empire,(Sd).
