The matter before the Conference was to consider whetherLord Beaverbrook should undertake any responsibility in regardto Home Propaganda.      The Committee had before tbem Paper Ho. G.T.-3703 by theMinister of Information, and Memorandum G.T.-3809 by thePood Controller,      CAPTAIH GUBST explained the existing organisation of theWar Aims Committee and indicated&quot; the advantage obtained bymaintaining the unity of the various political parties composingit.      LORD BEAYERBROOK said that he WBS satisfied that any attemptto put the War Aims Committee under his control would result inthe break up of that body,      CAPTAIH GUEST explained that to a limited extent the WarAims Committee were co-operating v?ith the Publicity organisationsof the various Government Departments, the Ministry of Pood,National Service and Munitions,  etc.
      MR* HEHHES drew attention to the work which was beingdone &quot;by him as Editor-in-Chief by circulating material tothe provincial paparg throughout the country *      It vi&amp;B decided that the Ministry of Information shouldnot take over the political work of the War Aims Committee and tthat for the present it was inadvisable for the Ministry ofInformation to deal with Home Propaganda.   A number of depart-mente oarried on home propaganda in connection with their workand it seemed the wiser  course to leave this work to them atany rate until the new Department of Information should havehad sufficient time to make a complete and careful survey andstudy of its future scope and activities.Whitehall Gardens, S..iv.
