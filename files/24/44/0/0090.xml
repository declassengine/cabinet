(Note by the Secretary)

With reference to Conclusion (c) of the draft Minutes of the Meeting of the 8th March, 1918 which was held to consider the question of Tanks the Minister Of Munitions wishes this conclusion deleted, but the Secretary  of State for War wishes it to remain an record. I  understand that the Minister of Munitions bases his objection on the fact that by the terms of the Anglo-American Agreement the Americans undertake to replace the steel provided by the British Government for armeur? plate on or about the date of delivery of the latter to the factory on the basis of ten per ton, and that therefore no allocation from British sources will be made if the Americans do not adhere to the terms of agreement. Further, the Minister of Munitions considers that the allocation as between the British Tank programme and the Angle-American programme is a domestic  matter for the Ministry of Munitions.
