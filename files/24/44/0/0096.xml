273Lord Robert Cecil has been good enough to  sondMEKORAKDUIM FOB THE WAR CABINET.me an advance copy of a. memorandum which he is  circulatingto the War Cabinet with regard to the accommodation at  theForeign Office.  His proposal is that either the  IndiaOffice or the Colonial Office should be turned  out  inorder to make room for the staff of his department,  andthose connected with it, and before it comes up fordiscussion I feel it my duty to let the War Cabinet knowhow seriously I regard the matter so far as the ColonialOffice is concerned.to the history of this matter.   Lord Robert says thatthe absolute necessity for throwing the Foreign Officeand Colonial Office into one has been constantly urged,and that objections were raised at the last moment.   Itis, I think, more accurate to say that the subject wasmooted last summer, and after I had stated my views,  itwas, as I thought, finally put to rest;  and I submitwith great respect that, while the Foreign Office arefully entitled to dwell on their own difficulties, andto make demands for increased space if they can justifythem, it is not within their province to assume thatthe Colonial Office is to be selected for eviction.   Ifully appreciate the difficulty with which the ForeignOffice is confronted.  We also have our difficulties.There is however this difference between us -  that thoughduring the War our work has more than doubled,  we havemanaged to struggle along with a very small increase  inFirst, I am unable to accept the statement asthe
274the number of our staff.   And I may add that I have,as the Cabinet knows, undertaken work which requiredthe setting up of a not inconsiderable Executive andstaff:  it was impossible to house this in the ColonialOffice.   The work is of the most secret a2id confidentialnature, and absolutely vital to the War, hut I, at  allevents, have found no difficulty whatever in communicatingwith my officials through the telephone, and in securingtheir presence within the course of a very few minutes      1                                  vwhen it has been necessary for mo to discuss questionswith them,, and I venture to submit that the adoption ofthe same method by the Foreign Office would be attendedwith no greater)!ifficulties than those with&apos;which I  amconfronted every day.   Almost the whole of the ForeignOffice argument for turning out the Colonial Office isfounded on the assumption that it is necessary to bringSir A. Steel-Baitland1s new department under the ForeignOffice roof.,    I hope it will not be thought I amtra,Yelling outside my province if I say that so farfrom accepting this argument, I am strongly of opinionthat it would be unwise to make the proposed change.If the new department is to win the confidence of thecommercial world, it seems to me highly desirable thatit should continue to be located in the City,  where itnow is, within easy reach of commercial people.  It isa well known fact that business men will not willinglycome West, and it is for this reason that the businessofficer, of the Dominion Governments are gradually beingtransferred from Westminster to the City.         I cannot see how the work of the Colonial  Officecould be carried on if we were to be turned  out of  ourpresent offices. &apos; The War Cabinet are well aware of the                                            importance
275 importance and urgency of the questions between us and the Dominions that spring up from day to day, and I submit,  with great respectbut with great  confidence that those questions are at  least as important as are any of those for which the Foreign Office -demand. additional accommodation-,      1 am not prepared to admit that the work of my department is less important for  the successful conduct of the far than that of tho  Foreign  Office, and if we are to be moved at presentt  I can foresee nothing but chaos as the result.      There is another aspect&apos;to which I would earnestly ask most serious attention?    The Dominions would I am convinced, see in this step  confirmation of the ous^ picienrwhich ram sure they  entertain from time to time, that our prof essionBin regard to  them-are little mere than-words,  and that&apos; in practice  we  pay little or no regard to them.when any interest  of  ours seems to pull in the contrary&apos;direction.   They  would especially re- sent the change- when they realise&quot;that - the Colonial Office was being sacrificed  for the,  benefit- of the Foreign  Office.    It may be  said  that this is a matter of sentiment., &apos;and I-do  not deny that sentiment does enter very considerably into  the&apos;&quot;  question.  The Colonial Office has teen in its  present premises-&apos; for very many years..   They are well  known to the Representatives of the Dominions and Colonies,  and they would regard it as a most- unfortunate  and deplorable thing if these old associations were  to  be &quot;terminated.- suddenly-,-and during the&quot; continuance  of the&apos; Wa,r.-  As a- practical matter,  I really do  not&quot; know  what the Foreign^ Office- proposal as&apos;regards  the Colonial Office is.  It is part of my.duty to  hold Conferences very  frequently in the Colonial Office.   They ere attended by Representatives                                               of
276        of the various Dominions,  and by others,  and  they        can only be held in a room of considerable  size.   I        at least know of no building where proper accommodation        for this purpose could by any possibility be  provided.        I am quite certain that the effect on the Dominion        Ministers, who are due to  arrive in this  country in        May, for the Imperial Conference,  would be  of the  very        worst possible character.     Confusion must arise  from        the uprooting of this great department, with  its records        and papers.    We have already a. very heavy task before        us in making the necessary preparations for the Conference,        This work cannot be adequately performed  in any less time        than that which we have at our disposal and if we  are to        spend&quot;a month in clearing out and settling  in somewhere        else, the effect on the wori  of the Conference must be        bad, while that produced in the minds of  the  Colonial        Ministers, will, I am satisfied be most unfortunate.             If I am asked whether I have any proposal to  make        I do not hesitate to say that with the telephone and the      .  taxi-cab or motor-car,  there should be no difficulty in        securing suitable accommodation at a very short distance        from the Foreign Office,  I am informed that  there is        more than one suitable  building with very considerable        accommodation which could  be made  an adjunct  of the        Foreign Office,  and.I at least am not prepared to admit        that there is any justification for creating  enormous        departments all under one  roof when supervision and con-        trol become extraordinarily difficult,  and  when it is        perfectly well-known that  by the mechanical means of the        day it  is quite easy to  get in close  touch  with officials        and secure their prompt  presence when they  are wanted,        even though they are not housed under the same roof.             I  desire most  respectfully to  cay that in no cir-        cumstances can I consent to the proposal-COLONIAL OFFICE,                                W.H.L.                                                   12th March,1918
