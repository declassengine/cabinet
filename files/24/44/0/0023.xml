The Rt,Hon.J.C,Smuti,K.C.  (in the Chair)   The Rt.hin.Lord Hardinge of      under Secretary of State        Penshurst,K.G.,G.C.B.&amp;c. -    for Foreign Affaire.   The Rt*Hon. Lord Beaverbrook  -  Minister of Information.   Admiral Sir Reginald Hall     -  Director of Intelligence                                      Division, Admiralty.   Colonel B&amp;T.Buckley           -  Intelligence Division,                                      War Office.   Mr* Gaze-lee                   -  Department of Information.                             Mr. Pembroke Wicks * Secretary.THE CHAIRMAN explained that the Conference had met to consider       whether it was desirable to reverse the decision contained       in War Cabinet 349/      Minute 11, that the Intelligence&apos;       Branch of the Department of Information should be trans-       ferred to the Foreign Office.   Lord Beaverbrook, in order       to do his work properly, must have information and       intelligence, and the question was, how best that could be       secured.LORD HARDIHGE pointed out that the decision to transfer the       Intelligence Branch to the Foreign Office arose out of a       suggestion made by Colonel Buchan and approved by Sir       Edward Carson.LORD BEAVERBROOK expressed the view that his Department must have       an Intelligence Branch of its own and must have direct       access to the War Office and the Admiralty for the political       intelligence they required.   If he were only able to       obtain euch information on political matters in foreign       countries as filtered through the Foreign Office, his       department would be dependent entirely upon the efficiency       of the Foreign Office and, if the Foreign Office failed,       his Department would fail.THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that the Intelligence Branch had been       under the Department of Information for a year and that the       situation had been strengthened by the appointment of a       Minister to take oharge of the Department of Information. He       suggested that the Intelligence Bureau should continue to       form part of the Depart/nsnt of Information and that the       Foreign Office, already being the recipient of ^screi       political intelligence from all sources, should constitute       an Intelligence Branch of its own.
           The Ministry  of  Information should use its own           Intelligence  Branch for  purposes  of propaganda while           the Intelligence Branch  of the  i^ozeign Office  should           issue  to  the  Cabinet the memoranda on political           intelligence  in  foreign  countries which had hitherto           been Issued by the  Department of  InformationsLORD EABDIPOE suggested  that,  if  there were  any Members of the           Intelligence  Branch of the Department of Information           who would desire to be-transferred to the  Foreign           Office, they  should be allowed  to do so.XIOT BEAVSRBROO&amp;  demurred to this and the  Chairman suggested           that it would not be desirable  for the foreign Office           to deprive the Department of Information of ^mberg           of the staff  of  its Intelligence  Bureau,LORD HARDIHGE made the reservetion  that the  decieion  that the           Intelligence  Branch should remain under the Ministry           of Information,  should be submitted for the approval           of Mr. Balfour.LORD BHAVERBROO&amp;  said he would prefer to  have a direct liai           between his Department and the  Admiralty end the           War Office for all  purposes.  He  was  prepared  to           accept the ruling of General ilac&amp;onogh es  to whether           the liaison with the War Office should consist oft           military officer appointed by the  Department of           Information,  or an  official  of  the Department  of           InformationTHE REPRESENTATIVES of the War Office and  Admiralty  *           expressed the view  that,  as  the political  infomK.-           tion they received  was necessarily incomplete  and           unco-ordinated,  it  was essential  that  it should be           sifted by experts in foreign politics  who  had  access           to all sources of political  information, end for           that reason they could only agree  to  transmit           political information coating into  their nands  to           the Ministry of  Information  thro ugh the me Altai  of           the foreign 0:!fice.SIR REGINALD HALL also emphasised the  ^reat  importance  of           protecting the&apos;&quot;secret sources of his  information.           A single set of carelessness in giving  publicity           to some fact might  endanger  the lives  of half a           doze$ secret agents.  Re hed the 51ret Lord*s           complete oonourrereo in  refusing to give political           information to any Department except the foreign           Office, who were\aceustomed  to handling most secret           matters of this kind.THE CHAIRMAN suggested that for the  time being the War Office           and the Admiralty should continue  to supply  their           information to the Foreign Office and  that the           Foreign Office should co-ordinate  it and pass on           whatever was necessary to  the Department of  Informa-           tion*LORD 3KAVEEBR00K said he was not prepared  to accept that           decision as final and would raise the matter again           after some time and experience of the working of           this provisional arrangement.  This was agreed  to. i)J*
The conclusions come to wero therefore that:-      1,    The Intelligence Bureau should remain      with, the Department of Information, subject      to Mr. Balfour!s concurrence, and that the      Foreign Office should constitute its own      Intelligence service for sifting and co-      ordinating political information reaching it      from other Departments.      2.    The Admiralty and ftar Office would pass      their political intelligence to the Foreign      Office who would be responsible for supplying      the Department of Information with suitable      intelligence.   This second point was accepted      by Lord Beaverbrook as a provisional arrangement,      which could be revised later.&quot;/hitshall  Gardens,  3.&apos;w:.  March 6th,  1918.
