Colonel tees 20SECRET.               (TlVB DoCMWWt i*     0----------. ^:iL!i.::JzJ&quot;e Property ofN.S.R, 28,           JH^ri^un^ ^JJc7y;^^m^^RECRUITING OF COAL MINERS.Memorandum by the Minister  of NationalIS            Service.     The War Cabinet Committee on Man-Power, in paragraph 52 oftheir draft report (0.185),  has recommended the recruitment of50,000 category A men, and 10,000 lower category men from thecoal mines.   The Ministry of National Service has agreed withthe Coal Controller the quotas to be allotted to the variousmining districts.     The Miners&apos; Federation at their meeting on the 27th Februarylast passed the following resolution;-         nThat this Conference of the Miners1 Federation     of Great Britain decides that a Ballot of all its     members shall be taken, and that the form of the     Ballot Paper shall be:-     1,   Shall the Miners1  Federation of Great Britain agree          to the withdrawal of 50,000 men from the Mines for          military service.     2,   If so, shall the Federation machinery be used for          the purpose of finding the required number?     It is anticipated that practically all the post-war minerswho are of a sufficient degree of medical fitness to be acceptedfor service in the Army, will have been withdrawn from the minesby the middle of this month.   It is essential that the withdrawalof these men should be followed promptly by the recruitment of thenecessary number of pre-war miners.   It is, therefore, proposedto issue immediately a decertification order, withdrawing all cer-tificates of exemption issued on grounds of employment to pre-warminers between the ages of 18 years 8 months and 2&apos;5 years,   It isconsidered essential that this order should be issued and that therecruitment should, proceed without waiting for the result of theballot on the above resolution, for the following reasons:-     1.   The necessary intake of men for the Army cannot be ob-          tained otherwise,     2.   All the information obtained points to the fact that          the miners expect the Government to proceed,     5,   Any hesitation would play directly into the hands of          the pacifist element in the Miners1 Federation, and          would seriously damage the growing prestige of the patriotic          element.     4.   The revised Schedule of Protected Occupations-came into          force on the 1st February; and if the comb-out of the coal          mines is held up it would establish an unjustifiable differ-          entiation of treatment, which would inevitably cause resis-          tance to recruiting in the munitions industries.     In these circumstances I ask for the authority of the &quot;&apos;ar Cabinetto proceed with the recruiting of the prescribed number of men on the   I^r  indicated.
