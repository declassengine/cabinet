W. ft&apos;JIP4-  I                                           Colonel Jonas    141(This Document is the Property of           / cf                                      Intelligence BureauSECRET                                Department of Information            WEEKLY  REPORT  OH  GDRfi^NY  XLI.                    (Maroh 7th 1918)    The peace with Russia, i,e. with the Bolshevist Government at Petrorrad, has been achieved, as the Kaiser  says in his telegram to Count Hertling. &quot;by the German sword1&apos;.   It  therefore does not fulfil the&apos; demands of the Reichstag resolution  of last July 19th, whioh oontemplatod a poace &quot;by understanding and declared    &quot;with suoh a peace forcible extensions of territory and political,     economic or financial acts of ooeroion are  incompatible&quot;.    On tho other hand the novel taotics of Trotsky at Brest-Litovsk; his desperate attempt to obtain a cessation of  war without a troaty of peace;  the excesses of Bolshevist &quot;bands in  Esthonia, Finland and tho Ukraine j  and finally the open appeals  of the Bolshevists to the working-olasso6 in Germany to bring about peace by revolution, completely alienated all German publio opinion  which at present oounts.   The German Majority Socialists have frankly declared that strikes, revolutionary movements or propaganda in the Army intended to weaken the German military fronts are not proceedings whioh will approve themselves to the German proletariate.   The Great majority of the Gorman masses, It is maintained, are repelled by Bolshevist methods.    The alienation of Gorman popular opinion by  the terrorist regime of the Bolshevists in the Western frontier territories will doubtless reoonoile the Majority Socialists to the ominous terms of Artiolo III, Seotion 2 of the Treaty which says:-    &quot;Russia undertook to refrain from all interference in the^   internal affaire of these territories, and to lot Germany and Austria decide the future of those territories in agreement  with;. thoir populations&quot;.
                         - 2 -   The  savins clause &quot;in agreement with their populations!1  is not initself  reassuring,  as Germany has already shown that she counts uponthe classes in these territories whose traditions and interestsrender  them averse  from any effective consultation of the masses.Moreover 1&apos;sthonia and Livonia are to be occupied by a &quot;Germanpolice  force&quot;, that is by German troops, until their security isguaranteed by their own national institutions and until their ownState organization is restored.   The restoration of the formerState organization of Esthonia and Livonia especially under tho eyeof a &quot;German police force&quot; would probably  result in something verydifferent from giving their populations a voice in their future politicaland economic relations with their neighbours.   The  references to Afghanistan and Persia are negative in form.The contracting parties undertake to respect their political andeconomic independence and territorial integrity.   But German schemesin Persia and German attempts to influence the Amir of Afghanistanduring  the war furnish indications of the policy which mir;ht befollowed at leisure after the withdrawal of Russian influence fromPersia.2,   The ratification of the treaty with Ulcrainia by the Reichstaggainst the feeble minority composed of the Independent Socialistsand the Poles does not mean that the rest of those who claim torepresent the German working-classes are free from misgivings.Scheidemann!s speech In the Reichstag on February 26th betrayedthe greatest anxiety regarding the action and aims of Germany inthe East.   Ee reminded the Chancellor that when on a formeroccasion amid the applause of the House he had declared himselfsupporter of the &apos;*self-determination- of peoples, he had not set   any bar  against permitting the peoples which had formed partor the Russian Empire to revert to their mother-country.
                        - 3 - According to the German terms of peace  it now  appeared Inevitable that the frontier peoples of Russia were going to oe torn from her.   It was doubtful whether this represented a gain \or the German people.   In the opinion of the  Majority which they thought ii their duty to express, these countries ought not to be brought into any relations with Germany which   they themselves did not approve of.    It was true  that the Bolshevists themselves were chiefly to blame for the turn events had taken.    As regards the West the Majority Socialists did not desire any such a position of power for Germany as would  enable her to impose upon the Entente a peace such as she had compelled Trotsky and Lenin to sign.   Tho German peoplo felt no satisfaction in the fact that Lithuania, Courland and Poland had boon moro or loss violently      compelled to lean towards Germany.   The  only subject of rejoicing was that at least one step towards a general peace had been made. For himself he viewed with the greatest mistrust the inclination towards Germany which these frontior peoplea had been induced to adopt.   The statement o;&apos; the Chancellor in the Committee concerning the  Vest w; s unfortunately unconvincing being capable of more than one interpretation, and the impression still prevailed abroad that the German Government had intentions with regard to Bricy and Longwy.   Like Lord Lansdowne in his  latest letter to the gaily Telegraph, Horr Soheidemann welcomed Hertling^ acceptance of President ,ilson&apos;s four points and his readiness to begin negotiations on that basis.   President Vilson thought that  these principles X,   Each part of the final settlement to be based upon the essential justice of that particular case and upon such  adjustments as will bring about a peace likely to be permanent. 2.   Peoples and provinces not to be bartered  about from sovereignty^to sovereignty even in the great game, now for  ever discredited, of the balance of power. 3.   Every territorial settlement to be made in tho interest of the peoples concerned and not as a part of any mere adjustment or compromise of claims among rival States.
                            - 4 - had been accepted by all except tho German militarist  and  annexationist party but, according to Sohoidemann, that party  was no longer  of decisive importance In Germany.   Whoever accopted Presidont Wilson1s four points must give up all plans of  conquest and violence.. Belgium must regain her complete independence and  thero must be no attempt to interfere in her domestic-.affairs -such  as the relations botween the Flemings end the Walloons.   Any attempt to Impose a peaoe by force upon tho East would result in the greatest  danger to Germany.   The world would have to  sleep sword  in hand.   Forj these reasons ho strongly condemned the Kaiser!s recent &quot;viotory:iI speech at Homburg deliverod at a moment when every word from anj authoritative quarter ought to be weighed in the gold  balance1 He saidJ-I    &quot;Therefore I now declare in tho name of the majority of thoj     people we represent that we do not sharo the views expressed     In that speech but. on the contrary, omphatically  repudiate them,I     We desire no humiliation of our enemies;  we wish  for  no peace     reposing on force.   We wish for a peace based upon freedom,     friendship and the mutual confidence of the  peoples.&quot; 3.   It seems worth while to have recapitulated  the main points[] of Scheidemann1 s speech in so far as it dealt with the questions of peace and war annexation and &quot;self-determination&quot; because it represents the high-water mark of opinion among  tho majority of the German people on these questions.   But the fatal  thing is  that                                influence this opinion has neither decisiveAin time of German reverses nor consistency In the faco of German victories.   Scheidemann himself In the second part of his speech, dealing  with tho reoent strikes and the domestic situation, showed that the Government horo too relied upon force and that tho highest triumph of this policy &quot;as achieved when the Commander-in-Chief in tho Mark of Brandenburg took complete charge of the strike situation.    &quot;What von Kesscl did        ......... ......................................... ...... .......[JPeotnote oont.)IX   All well-dofined national aspirations to be accorded thGfctmost satisfaction that can bo accorded thorn without introducing neu or Perpetuating old elements of discord and antagonism that would be Ukely in time to break the peace of ;.mropc...
for Berlin and the Empire v/ith his proclamation years will notundo&quot;.   There were Germans who hugged themselves with pleasureat the thought that Germans might &quot;be called upon to shoot downGermans.   He contrasted the attitude of Walraff, ImperialSecretary of State for the Interior with that of Mr Lloyd Georgewho went down to Wales and personally dealt with the workmen onstrike.   The action of the Conservatives and National Liberals inregard to the suffrage o/uestion In the Prussian Chamber was anotherthing that had intensified the grave discontent among the masses.   The lesson of the domestic situation in Germany and of theattitude of the masses towards questions of peace and war seems tobe such that no propaganda from the outside could be more effectivethan what is happening daily before their eyes and vitallyaffecting their interests.   If they are unable to make their willor their desires prevail under the spur of these events and theexhortations of their own leaders, they are not likely to pay muchattention to the most persuasive or eloo^uent foreign representationof the case against their rulers.   The best that can be hoped isthat when Hertlin;;, for purposes of his own, discusses speeches 111:President Wilson1s, Germans may be induced to bestow more impartialattention upon these authoritative utterances and to exercise inan increased degree their own judgement in regard to them.Otherwise there could be no better propaganda than the circulationin collected form of utterances by     German critics  Socialistand other of the German Government.  But the drawback is thatpropaganda of this kind would enable the German Government throughnumerous channels at its disposal to denounce these home critics asreally working in the Interests of &quot;the enemy&apos;&quot;&apos;.
4.   The  speeches or Eertllng and Payer - tho Radical Vice-Chancellor  who appeared for the first time In tho Reiehstag -are now to  hand in tho  original German,   Hertlingfs speech isvitriolic as  regards England with an admixture of tho peculiaraversion  to this country which many German Catholics entertain.The speech  is much more compact than Bethmann-Hollwog1s and avoidsthose digressions or side-controversies which laid Bethman opento alliod criticisms.    It gives the keynote which reappears inscores of German newspaper articles by carefully distinguishingbetween the attitude of President Wilson and that of the spokesmenof the European Allios, especially Mr Lloyd George,   It is manifostthat the  German Government hopos for further opportunities ofemphasizing this alleged distinction and will doubtless endeavourto find them  in the matter of Japanfs intervention in Siberia.It is noteworthy that Hcrtling frankly rejects the judgement of thev7hole world upon Germany&apos;s policy   Y/hen tfr  V/Ilson in one part of his speooh says that the German   Imperial Chancellor  is addressing tho Court of the whole world,   I must,  as  things now stand, decline In the Name of the German   Empire and its Allies to recognize this Court, as It is   pre judiced.   Kortling as an academic personage has adorned his speech withtags from St,  Augustine and Aristotle, but ho would &quot;as things nowstand&quot; reject the tag &quot;oecurus judicabit orbis terrarum&quot;.   He isthoroughly  conscious, as all Germans are,  that the judgement andsentiment of  the world  is against Germany, but, for the present,he evidently  thinks that the Imposing tangible successes of theGerman arms in the East outweigh this adverse verdict *    Thefuture, he  evidently considers, may be saved by stubborn militaryPersistence on tho wostcrn front and by diplomacy in dividingGermany&apos;s western adversaries and dealing  separately with them onvital questions.   The  verdict o.&apos; the world would then perhaps be
                         &quot;* V **reversed as  a  tribute to Germany1 s final sucoess.   In the meantimeHertling does  not feol any necessity for cloaking the real natureof Germany1 s intentions with regard to &quot;liberated:!Poland forexample.    &quot;uite  apart froi. the cutting and carving which it isto undergo  for the benefit of Ukrainia and of the strategicalsecurity of Germany1s eastern frontiers, its political constitutionis to be decided  not merely provisionally under the supervisioncf Germany  in  conjunction with Austria-Hungary,   Hertling says:-   &quot;The constitutional problem in the narrowor sense, the question    what constitution tho new State is to receive,could naturally    not be  decided straight away and even now is still in the    sta^e of detailed consideration by the three Powers concerned,&quot;   This conception of the&quot;independence&quot;of Poland is on all fourswith German intentions with regard to the future of Lithuania, which.,according to Erzborger, one of the most outspoken of Hertling&apos;sformer political  associates in the Catholic Centro and himself aleading propagandist, is to be an &quot;independent&quot; State but is alsoto be &quot;In perpetual alliance  with Germany;1   Count Hertling&apos;s theories of &quot;liberation&quot; do not extend beyond thejfrontior portions of Russia which It is in Germany?s interest toliberate.   Tho emancipation of Jerusalem and a great part ofPalestine from the sw y of the Turk does not appeal to him,&apos;and in[this regard he must find himself, as a Catholic leader, in[embarrassing divergence from the views of the Eoly See whichfcith the great majority of Catholios throughout the world hasExpressed its  joy at the restoratidn of tho Holy Places toIhristendoivi.J.   In connection with what Hertling said on the subject of BelgiumIher-e has boen a  discussion of this subject in the German press.Jis suggestion that negotiations regar\liri(T^be               ofBelgium should be opened by  an exchange of views between Berlin

Hertling says:-   &quot;The constitutional problem in the narrowor sense, the question    what constitution tho new State is to receive,could naturally    not be decided straight away and even now is still in the    stage of detailed consideration by the three Powers concerned.&quot;   This conception of the11 independence &quot;of Poland is on all fourswith German intentions with regard to the future of Lithuania, which,according to Erzborger, one of the most outspoken of Hertling&apos;sformer political associates in the Catholic Centro and himself aleading propagandist, is to be an &quot;independent&quot; State but is alsoto be &quot;ih perpetual alliance  with Germany   Count Hertling&apos;s theories of &quot;liberation&apos;1 do not e::tend beyond thefrontlor portions of Russia which it is in Germany Js interest toliberate.   Tho emancipation of Jerusalem and a great part ofPalestine from the sw y of the Turk does not appeal to him,&apos; and inthis regard he must find himself, as a Catholic leader, inombarra8sing divergence from the views of the Holy See whichwith the great majority of Catholics throughout the world hasexpressed its  joy at the restoration of tho Holy Places toChristendom.5.   In connection with what Hertling said on the subject of Belgiumthere has been a discussion of this subject in the German press.His suggestion that negotiations regardiiig^the^rt^^        of Belgium should be opened by  an exchange of views between Berlin
148  1and Kavre, the present seat of the Belgian Government,is eitherextraordinarily naive or extraordinarily cynical.   One of thefundamental difficulties in the way of any &quot;peace by Understanding&quot;with Germany is precisely the fact that Germany seems determinedto detach Belgium from the Western Powers, with whom the Germanonslaught has driven her into military and political alliance.The Belgian Government Itself has Indicated that it cannotoontemplate a return to the political status  quo ante beHum,that is to say perpetual neutrality, and territorial, Integrityguaranteed by an international treaty, to which Germany wns apartner.   It would be worse than no guarantee to have to trust  to thegood faith of the Power which violated its treaty obligationsand did Belgium a terrible&quot;wrong &quot;which- the moralist,Hertling,shows no willingness to right.   It is difficult to see howBelgium could In future maintain precisely the same relations  withGermany as with her present allies.   Incidentally it may bementioned that there is a vigorous revival of the German attacksupon Belgium for her own alleged violation of her neutrality beforethe war In her relations with tho Powers of the Entente especiallyEngland.   These charges were finally disposed of long ago byBaron Boyens who was Belgian Minister in Berlin, when the war brokeout.6.
