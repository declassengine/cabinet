(This Document is the Property oftransfer of the Control of Refrigerated Meatto the Ministry of Food.Memorandum by the Food Controller.        As meat rationing  is now  established in London and  will be extended to the whole .country  next  month, it is  essential  that I should be able  to  control all supplies  of  meat,  since any failure  in the present meagre ration  will certainly  cause  trouble.        I must, therefore, ask that  an end be put  to  the present arrangement by which the Board of Trade control the bulk of the imports of refrigerated meat and  allocate it to the Army, to  the . French, to the Italians or to the civilian population without any control by the Ministry of Food or any reference to the needs of this country  or of the Allies at  the moment, but under agreements made under totally different circumstances 2 years  ago. As  a  result of these agreements  the Board of  Trade now proposes to divert to Prance 2 cargoes  of  meat purchased by  mo  and carried  In British ships on which I am relying to carry out the ration scheme.        Further during the month  of  January, i.e.  during the  period at which the  Meat Shortage- in this country was  most acute,  the Board of Trade - without reference to this Department -  delivered to Italy no less than  2,500 tons of Meat mere than they  were required  to do ever. under  the existing agreements with that country.        These allocations  are made by  the Board of  Trade without any reference to  the  Inter-Allied Meat &amp; Fats Executive which is  part of the general machinery of the Inter-Allied Council  as  set.up by agree- ment between  the  countries to deal with allocations of meat supplies between Great Britain, France and Italy 5.n the  same way as  the Wheatf                                                   Executive/
Executive deal with the allocation of Wheat supplies.        The continuation of these separate agreements between theBoard of Trade and the French and Italians with regard to suppliesis incompatible with the general arrangements for the distributionof supplies among the Allies., on which the Americans have so stronglyinsisted.        I must ask, therefore, that the allocation of meat betweenGreat Britain, France and Italy, shall be made by the Meat &amp; FatsExecutive acting under the Interallied Council and that thearrangements for the purchase of frozen meat abroad should be placedunder my control..        I fully appreciate the proper anxiety of the Army Councilthat Army supplies should not be in any way endangered, and Iwould arrange that the supply of the amount required for the Armyon the scale laid down by the War Cabinet should be the first chargeon any supplies brought to the country, and that an adequate reserveshould be kept under the Army control.  This system is workingperfectly well with regard to Army imported bacon, cereals, sugar andother foodstuffs and I see no reason why meat should- be differentlytreated.                                                RHONDDA,MINISTRY OF FOOD,     8th March, 1918.
