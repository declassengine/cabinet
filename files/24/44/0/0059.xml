(Copy of letter dated 7th March, 1918, from ?. Macnamare to Secretary, War Cabinet).

--------------------

"On Tuesday last, the 5th March, at the close of the discussion on the question raised by Mr. Butcher, M.P., that the rates of separation allowances now payable to wives and dependants of petty officers and men of the Royal Navy and to warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and man of the Royal Marines should be so readjusted as to equal the rates in force for the wives and dependants of warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Army, I suggested that this question should be referred to the War Cabinet Committee on Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay over which sir Edward Carson presided. I have asked Sir Edward and he will be glad to serve again as Chairman if the War Cabinet wishes.

In case your attention has not been drawn to this matter, I should be glad if you would take the necessary action to bring the matter to the notice of the War Cabinet at an early date".
