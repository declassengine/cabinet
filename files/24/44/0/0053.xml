Report for week ended 6th  March,  1918                         Flax Production Branch.          ;The land contracted for- flax growing now amounts to7,709 acres.   in view of the fact that the Dutch seed has not yetarrived in this country, existing stocks of 2-nglish grown seed are&quot;being distributed so that early  sowing may not he delayed,Samples of seed grown in this country la9t year have now beenexamined and seed of Dutch origin and satisfactory germinationis being collected at a central  depot and cleaned.   The remainder-has been released and placed at  the disposal of the grower,   Thedistribution of the 7,709 acres  contracted for is as follows:-Yeovil area, 2,460 acres;  Selby  area 2,706 acres;  Peterborough area1,255 acres; Suffolk area 659 acres;  Fife area 629 acres.                               Kelham Estate.          The Committee of Management have now decided upon theirlive stock policy, and a start has been made.   Of the 2,000 acresto be taken in hand by the Committee in April next and farmed bythem, 1,065 acres have already come under their contjol, and this-area is being ploughed, cleaned  and sown with cereals  and roots.Cf the remaining 935 acres, it is now arranged to mow 400 acres forhay, use 400 acres for grazing purposes, and let off 135 acres forfeeding.   Purchases of cattle,  sheep and horses were  decided upon,estimated to cost  8,500, the class of live stock to be providedbeing determined in the light of local requirements for milk., thespecial conditions now obtaining with regard to this question andtheir effect upon prices, and the necessity of providing a minimumnumber of cattle from year to year for the purposes of the generalfarming policy.   A decision was also made as to the initiation ofthe sugar beet cropping scheme.   It was agreed not to rely uponimported seed for the proposed first factory campaign of 1920. inview of the shortage of seed in Europe,   Arrangements were made tosow in 1918 five plots of 5 acres each for production  of seed inthe autumn of 1919.   Pour plots to be sown with seed  of French andGerman origin reproduced in this country bs&apos; the Society.   Two ofthese plots to be reserved for seed for 1920, and two  for selectionof roots according to the sugar  content as the foundation of aseed-station for providing seed  in later years.   The  remaining plotto be sown with &quot;mother1&apos; seed acquired, if possible, from Holland,would act as a further safeguard against the failure to commence thesugar beet scheme with seed of a satisfactory charaoter.
