Oolonel Jones282.SECRET.( This Document is the Property otHis Britannic)V.eniment.)Secretary,Copy Ho.19War Cabinet.       The question of the days upon which Summentimeis to begin and end at present produces an annual cropof correspondence between our own and the French Armies.As we are fighting in France, and now in Italy also, we.naturally have to give way when the French and Italiandate differs from ours.    This leads to considerableinconvenience.   The Press in particular are affected,as night Communiques often reach them at an inconvenientlylate hour during the period when Summertime prevails inFrance and not in Great Britain.   This year there isonly a fortnights difference between the introductionOf Summertime In France and in England, and I think itwould have been possible to arrive at an agreement as toa uniform date with the French and the Italians,  if the&apos;matter had been taken up In time,   I suggest that thisbe done as regards the change from Summer to Winter timethis year, and all changes of time in future0(Sd.) Henry Wilson.OaI;GsSo11th March 1918.
