(1)        6th March, 1918,Sir,          I beg to submit  the  following report on the work of theFood Production Department for the  week ended 5th March 1918:-                      The  Weather.          Ploughing progressed favourably during the past week inspite of the fact that   severe frosts,  and In some counties snow-storms, were experienced.          A large acreage  of spring corn has  already been sown inthe Midlands, and cultivation  is  well  advanced in the northern andnorth western counties.                 LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.  &quot;               Agricultural Executive  Committees.Devon. The Chairman and  three  other members of the ExecutiveCommittee (Earl Portescue,  Sir Ian  Amory and  Sir Henry Lopez andthe Earl of Portsmouth)  have undertaken to help the Devon Farmers&apos;Union in a test case wherever  it  may be found that a landlord hasgiven notice to quit a farm in consequence of the breaking up ofgrass land under an order  of the  Executive Committee.Kent. The Committee have been  authorised to take possession of afarm of 144 acres at Molash comprising  92 acres of arable landwhich is in a deplorable state.   They will cultivate the  fa&quot; mthemselves, and the manager employed will make arrangements forthe breaking up of a large  area of  grass land which is  availablein the immediate neighbourhood and  with which the present occupiersare not in a financial position to  deal.Somerset. The Committee  are about to take possession of 78 acresof market garden land in the Cheddar and Axbridge district,  which
has been  seriously  neglected.    They will cultivate the  land forfearly  and second-early potatoes.  They have also given orders tothe occupiers  of  65 acres  of land in the same neighbourhood to  Icultivate similar crops.    This  scheme has been prepared aftercareful inspection;  most  of the land selected has been  known asgood potato  land  in former years but has now fallen into a bad  Jof cultivation.           As a result of an inspection by a representative of dTechnical Division, the Committee have also been authorised to  tjpossession of  two derelict farms aggregating 550 acres on theCheddar Hills. They will  cultivate these farms themselves brin^as much land as possible under the plough.Yorkshire, North  Riding.   Owing to the dilapidated state of thedwelling  house and  buildings, a farm of 176 acres in this distrlcannot be adequately cultivated.   The landlord has been approacbut cannot be  induced to spend any money on repairs.   The Northallerton  District Council  have made a closing order with regardthe dwelling house, but the Committee have now been authorised  ttake possession and carry  out the necessary repairs^ and have ttfore asked the District Council to defer the operation of theirclosing order.Anglesey. The Committee have arranged to cultivate 26 acres  of.Holyhead  Golf  Course.Monmouth. The County Executive Committee have issued cultivaticorders in respect of a long list of gardens.  The Committee repothat excluding the  County Borough of Newport there are now 9,487allotments covering 651 acres in the county, which is about fourtimes  as  many  as  there were in 1916.            ..Prosecutions.   In Leicestershire Captain Bellville was fined  50
  and 5 guineas costs for failure to comply with an order to breakI? up grass land;  his bailiff had been granted exemption from military  service on the ground that the grass land had to be ploughed.:            A fine of  25 and  10 costs was imposed on the tenant of  a 200 acre farm at Rushden, Northamptonshire, for failure to comply  with a notice ordering him to plough up 56 acres by February 1st.  Drainage of Lands *   The Norfolk Committee are taking up, under  paragraph (h) of Regulation 2M, the clearning of the drainage channels  about iest pereham, and the Worcestershire Committee are taking  similar action with regard to the Bow Brook.  Damage by Game.  Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from  Essex, Kent and Surrey, and under the Pheasants Order from Essex.  Determination of Tenancies *  5 Orders have been made during the  ;?eek authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of  bad farming in respect of 56 acres, and2&quot;Orders have been made by  the Board determining the tenancies of 354. acres.                      HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.  Horticultural Organisation.   Horticultural Sub-Committees of the  Agricultural Executive Committees have been formed in 20 counties  and efforts are being made to secure the appointment of similar  committees in the remaining Counties.   In some counties the  Horticultural Organisation is now complete and comprises the county  Horticultural Sub-Committee and District Committees, to each of which - is attached a Horticultural Representative of this Department and  village correspondents.   In those counties where the organisation is  most successful, these committees are working in close co-operation  with the Women&apos;s far Agricultural Committee.            As an example of the useful work whioh is being done -where  the complete organisation exists, Warwickshire may be taken.   During  the past year the County Horticultural Organisation provided 70  demonstrations in fruit bottling, secured the spraying of potatoes  on .an extensive scale, founded 120 Food Production Societies and  Allotment Associations, secured the cultivation of the gardens of  men on military duty, established a scheme for the disposal of
surplus vegetable produce, distributed 400 dozen glass jars forfruit and vegetable preserving, and arranged for Horticultural,instruction In different parts of the country.   As a result ofwork the area under cultivation in many villages was Increased b100$.Fruit Section.   During the past week 73 demonstrations in fruitvegetable preserving have been given.   Arrangements have been mfor starting a small canning centre at St. Neots,Fruit and Vegetable Empties.  Owing to representations made by tDepartment, Railway Companies are now dealing with the accumulatof empties in northern&quot;markets.Osier Growing and Cutting.  The Department has arranged for thecutting of osier beds in the Trent and Ouse Valleys.   18 soldieare engaged in this work which is progressing satisfactorily. 7tons of brown osiers have been purchased in this district for thMinistry of Food.Agricultural; Baskets for Market Work.  As the result of negotiatwith Mr. V. Vandenborght,&apos; a basket works has been established atHammersmith and it is estimated that there will be an output fronthe,factory of not less than 700 baskets per week.   The factoryis run as a co-operative society and from 30 to 40 workers of whoa certain number of women, are employed.          Basket making centres are also being started innumerouvillages in Nottinghamshire.Fruit Preserving-.   The propaganda work in encouraging fruit presing is reflected in the great Increase in the number of ordersreceived by makers of fruit sterilising and preserving apparatus,communications from manufacturers indicate that there is an unprecedented demand for this class of apparatus.   Considerable diffi                                    15culty is being experienced by the manufacturers in obtaining thenecessary material and it is hoped that It may be possible toarrange for the allocation of the tin plate necessary for themanufacture of the apparatus.
                                                                   I6iMunitions Forks&apos; Allotments,  jfcs-ja ^e^uli--^ tint negotiations betweenthe;Ministry of inanitions  and this Department,  it  is hoped  thatthe Ministry of Munitions  will  circularise  the  whole of  the Munitionworks and controlled  establishments  (over 4,000) laying  before themthe suggestions made  by the Department  to secure the increase inallotments cultivated by munition workers .   The Belgian munitionfactory at Colnbrook  and the  Pelabon Shell  Factory at  Twickenhamare both prepared  to  cultivate  an additional 4  acres of  ground.Mr. Van Crshoven of the Belgian Ministry of Agriculture  is  endearvtniringto  secure a similar arrangement at other Belgian munitionfactories.Provision of land  for Allotments.  During the past week  theAllotment Inspectors  visited  34 local  authorities  and  as a  result oftheir visit the latter are taking steps to  secure  an additional600 acres of land  (8,000 allotments).    At  Coventry 60 acres havebeen secured (480  allotments),  Cheltenham 32 acres (443  allotments),Bedford 53 acres (812 allotments), ^allasey 27  acres  (415 allotments),.Stockport 36 acres (548 allotments), and Hyde 31 acres (465allotments).          The number  of applications for &quot;war plots&quot; providedunder the Cultivation of Lands  Order,  1917  (iio, 2) which have beenreported to the Department is 258,283,  and  the  number  of plotsprovided is 232,289 containing  a total  area of  16,920  acres.Marketing.  Representatives of  the County Horticultural  Organisationswere invited to r.  conference  which was  held on  the 28thFebruary.     The  delegates from 32  counties attended  and there  warealso present representatives  of the  Ministry of Food,  the LocalGovernment Board and  the Board  of Education.    The Conferenceexpressed its opinion&apos; tnu* the  marketing of surplus produce shouldbe  organised-on a  county basis, *and  the delegates  undertook totake steps in their several counties to start an organisation forthe purpose.    There was  general agreement that transport  offersthe greatest difficulties.   The existing large surpluses ofcarrots amounting  to  1,000 tons in Shropshire Is engaging the
tattention of the Department, and arrangements are being madewhereby a considerable number of these surpluses will be disposed ]of.                         TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land,  (1) An officer inspected an area of about 600acres on the Buckminster Estate, Leicestershire in  order to enablethe Department to consider more fully  a  scheme submitted by theExecutive Committee for the cultivation  of  this land for 1919,Almost the whole area is under grass,  of quite fair quality, but itpresent condition is deplorable, and a considerable proportion ispractically derelict.  Generally speaking,  the land is  eminentlysuitable for ploughing and  would probably yield good crops, althougconsiderable expenditure  on clearing,  draining, etc. would berequired.  The land is at present  let  to&apos; several occupiers, some ofwhom live at a distance,  and  in view of  all  the circumstances theInspector is satisfied that the only way to ensure  its  adequatecultivation is fcr the Department  to authorise the  Committee toproceed with the scheme they have  submitted,  namely, to enter Intopossession and break up the land immediately, with a view  to sowingit with wheat next autumn.        (2)  Tooting Bee  Golf Course,&apos;  in Surrey, has been  inspectedand suggestions made as to  the cultivation  and cropping of portionsof the Course *Soiling Crops for Dairy Cowso  At  the  request of the Committee  on tProduction and Distribution of Milk, a memorandum  on this  subjecthas been prepared, and  sill shortly be issued in  leaflet form.Potat  Spraying:Exper.iiaent3 in,.-19-18.   A  scheme  of  large scale expeiments  with horse-drawn  sprayers has been drawn up  and  will be putinto  operation this  season.   The experiments will  be carried  out itthe potato-growing  areas  in the Eastern counties  and in Lancashire.Many  of the large  growers in those districts are  sceptical as to tladvantages  of  spraying,  and further propaganda  on the  subject isdesirableo
Frit Fly Experiments.  A scheme of simple experiments in thecontrol of Frit Fly will be carried out in areas specially subjectto this disease.  It is desired to secure information as to theresults of (1) date of sowing, (2) different manurial treatment,with tillering and non-tillering varieties of oats respectively,                        LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour. Under the recent Sfar Office decision to releasefurther skilled men in exchange for the unskilled men still t* besupplied under the ffar Cabinetfs decision of the 27th June last,a few additional men are arriving at the Distribution Centres, andCommissioners have been instructed to examine them as to theirqualifications.  50 of the ploughmen home from Overseas on threemonths1 agricultural furlough have gone back during the week,leaving 1,232 on the land.  All these men will be returning ttFrance this week.         Exclusive of the men above mentioned, the number ofsoldiers attached to Depots to date is 36,521 (25,976 so-called&quot;skilled&quot; and 10,545 &quot;unskilled&quot;).  Of these 32,849 (24,629&quot;skilled&quot; and 8,220 &quot;unskilled&quot;) are out with farmers.

A somewhat noteworthy change in the method of  salehas been agreed by the British Basic Slag Company,  as a result  of thdiscussion with makers as to the arrangements for next season.           &apos;*   .........This firm has hitherto sold on the basis of citric  solubility andhas been the principal- exponent of the value of the citric  acidtest  as against the method of selling on a total phosphate  basisiThe Company has now decided to sell their slag next year  on thebasis of-total phosphate,-without a guarantee of citric solubilityand the principal difficulty which has hitherto existed in  establishIng a uniform scale of prices will thus be removed.Drain Pipes.  Enquiry has&quot; been made in regard to the supply of  draiipipes in Essex  and Cambridge. -. . It. appears that although  consideratequantities are- being- produced the demand is ,in excess of  the supply-             ......Some  of the  firms&apos; xyoncerned -appear to be willing to employ  prisoner             * - &apos;  -  -  -......  .....labour, and  as&apos;in  several ^oases-there are camps near the  works, itis hoped that it may be possible to. supply their needs from this  VJsource.
 Stable Manure.   An Army Council Instruction drawing the attention, of all Commands to the ,urgent importance of distributing manure from remount, depots, has now been approved.   No price has been fixed for delivery, but manure can be obtained by farmers direct, in their own carts, at 1/- per load, or, by -allotment holders at 6d.. per load.    A. further concession granted is that allotment holders are all.o?;ed to cart single, lots of one ton. free of charge. Enquiry is being made as, to what; accumulations of manure exist in the different  Commands. Materials for  Insecticides.. . Active steps are being.taken to secure a sufficient supply of materials- such as soft soap, nicotine, arsenate of lead and soda crystals for. use in &quot;connection with fruit and potato spraying.&apos;   In the case of&quot; soft soap, the Oils and Pats Branch, of the. Ministry of Food, have &apos;allotted ample rav.- materials, and arrangements are being made i whereby&apos; the&apos; makers, will&apos; giv.e . priority to agricultural demands.   A similar arrangement is being,made in the ease of nicotine.   As regards arsenate of lead,  the Ministry of Munitions have agreed to allot to this Department substantial quantities of- raw material leaving the distribution among the different makers to this Department.   The supply of soda crystals  for potato spraying is drawn in the main from two large firms, who.have now agreed to a uniform delivered price for one ton to approved towns, whence smaller quantities can be distributed in.rural districts.   As soon as this arrangement is finally. concluded it will be possible to giveapriority to requirements for agricultural purposes. ,      .    --,                   &apos;- Seed Vheat for Spring Sowing.  The Wheat Commission-have been asked to,allocate 5*000 quarters of No.l. Northern Manitoba wheat for seed purposes at Liverpool, and 2,500 quarters at a Bristol Channel port, preferably at Bristol. .            &quot;- .Seed.Qats.  The,demand for. Irish Black Tartarian oats still exceeds:&apos;the supply  and the stocks purchased by the Department are for the                              &quot; -11-
present exhausted.   Some 2,000 quarters of Kanx Abundance whit^oats remain-on hand, 5,500 quarters having been disposed of.   Thestocks of Scottish white oats now amounts to 1,800 quarters;Licences for the Export of Soed Oats from Scotland.   In view of vurgent necessity for expediting supplies of seed oats for theSouthern counties of England it has been decided to issue Generallicences for the delivery of oats in the counties of Norfolk;Cambridge, Northampton, Oxford and Gloucester, or any place southof these counties, in order to avoid the delay involved by theapplication for, and the issue, of individual licences.   13.9 ofthese General Licences have been issued.   During the week 903licences covering 40,688 quarters for seed purposes and 24 licencescovering 775 quarters for milling oats have been Issued.Seed Potato Supply.  The total quantity of seed potatoes ordered Iforv/ard amounts to 22,147 tons, and the total quantity delivered il7,612 tons.                                             -        IPotato Spraying.  During February 300 lectures on Potato Sprayinghave been given.   lectures are being arranged for detachments ofmen  as they are drafted into the Agricultural Battalion stationedat Reading Barracks.         Arrangements have been made \;hereby the University                                                                 iauthorities at Cambridge will carry out experiments in the FenDistrict this season.Seed Experts and military Service.   At a Conference held on-Fridflast between representatives of the Ministry of National-Serviceand of this Department, the Ministry agreed to give favourableconsideration to applications for the temporary release from thecolours of Seed Experts of low category at present serving in thicountry.   In order to allow seed firms to get over the spring ruof business the Ministry also agreed to instruct their LocalRepresentatives that no man should be taken from any of the prince                              -12-
firms during the next two months.   The Ministry further agreedthat in cases where the Pood Production Department guaranteed aman (not Class &quot;A&quot; and not under 30 years of age) to be indispensableand employed in certain specified work in connection with theproduction, cleaning and distribution of seeds, will not becalled up for Military Service.Provision of Labour for,Seed Growers.  The Departments SeedsAdvisory Committee recomnend that special steps should be takento ensure lhat farmers engaged in seed-growing should obtain suchlabour as they may require.   The Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees in the seed-growing counties are, therefore, beingasked to give special priority to all applications for labourreceived from this class of farmer.   Enauiries as to the possibilityof securing men with experience  in seed-growing from the prisonercamps which are being established throughout the country are alsobeing made.Importation of Seeds Grown on Contract Abroad.   The ForeignOffice is being asked to arrange with the responsible authoritiesin France, Italy and the United  States of America, that norestrictions shall be placed on  the export from those countriesof seeds grown on contract for British Seed Houses from stockseeds sent out by those Houses.I am,Sir,Your obedient Ser ant,8Director-General.
