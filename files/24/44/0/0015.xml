WAR CABINET.

SUPPLY OF DOCTORS FOR THE ARMY.

Memorandum by sir Edwin Cornwall.

1. I desire to express my strong concurrence with the  Memorandum of February 19th by the Minister of national service (G.T.3670), and? to support his view that "it would not be either politic or justifiable to proceed with the arrangements necessary to meet the present demand unless the War Office are able to show that all possible plans have been considered and put into operation to secure the fullest use or the medical personnel, of the R.A.M.C. now at their disposal, both at home and abroad".

2. I am bound to inform the war Cabinet that the constant withdrawal of doctors to the Army from the civil population has already reached a point at which the civilian medical service has been brought to the verge of a breakdown in many places,  and would is certain places actually have broken down unless certain doctors had quickly been returned specially from the Army  to civil practice in those places.

? There is abundant evidence in my Department as to the serious state of affairs in this respect. I will here only mention two facts.

(a) On January 1st of this year, there were 13,234 doctors serving the Army (say 5,000,000 persons) or one doctor  to 37? persons; the number of doctors available for the wh?ls civil population of England and Wales (?ay 34 1/2 million persons) was 14,718, or one doctor to 2,344 persons. Thus, on present R.?.M.C. standards,  the Army  possesses Six times a as many doctors as the civil population, for the ? number of persons;

(b) To illustrate the same point in another way, the three following places may be taken :-

Jarrow, with a population of 55,489 persons has now only 12 doctors left; whilst the Army has, for the same number of persons,  142 doctors:

Luton, with a population of 49,978 has now only 13 doctors left; the Army has, for the same number of persons, 133 doctors:

?ancera, with a population of 17,353,  has now only 3 doctors left; the Army has, for the same number of persons, 46 doctors;

4. These three towns are full of munition workers,  shipbuilders and other essential national services; so that, quite apart from the needs of women and children, the danger to the  health of essential war workers that if being occasioned by the Army&apos;s continuous drain of doctors it  most serious.

5.


5. Should the War Cabinet seriously contemplate giving sanction to these further demands now from the Army, for more doctors to be taken from the civil population, I beg to be allowed the opportunity of submitting full memoranda of facts and reasoned statements on the whole subject.

(Signed). EDWIN CORNWALL.
