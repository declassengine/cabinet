The question has arisen as to whether Russian goodsordered against British, American and French credits shall belisted and passed through a sort of clearing-house with a viewto their absorption, so far as possible, by the countries fur-nishing money for them and , subsequently -as to the remainder,which would be chiefly munitions of war, applying it to thebeet uses of our respective armies.  In suggesting such a clsar-ing-house I had in mind that, as to the munitions at least,this work had boat be done at Versailles,  I am still of thatopinion.  Others differ with me,          I regret to ask your attention to a matter relativelysmall as compared to tho great questions which thrust themselvesupon you every day.  However, I think I know your attitudetoward the Versailles Council.  I think it is llr. Wilson1 s at-titude,  Kence, it is my duty to support that view.  If I maybe permitted a figure of speech in an official communication,permit me to say that,  although fully aware of the fact that theorganization is still weak there, X cling to the skirts of theVersailles woman, skeleton though she may be, in the hope t&amp;Mbelief that flesh will be put upon her bones and that she willbe a fair and helpful person in carrying on the war,   I,  there-fore, am of opinion that matters even of relatively small  im-portance should be referred to Versailles, even if, for &amp; time,they cannot be taken over , in order that impetus may thus  begiven to build up centralized organizations to determine forus all questions affecting military operations which cannot  intheir nature be wisely determined independently ,          By reason of the facts above stated, I lay  the mattirbefore you and ask whether or not you desire, so far  as yourGovernment is concerned, that the clearing-house for  Bussiongoods of military character remaining after the absorption bythe respective creditor Governments of what they can  take  over,shall, or shall not, be established by the military advisersto the Supreme War Souncil at Versailles,(Sd.) OSCAR T. CROSS?.
