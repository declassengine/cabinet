WAR CABINET

RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO PRISONERS OF WAR.

Memorandum by Lord Newton.

A number of questions have occurred lately in connection with prisoners of war in regard to which there has been disagreement between the various Departments. There  is at present no means of arriving at a decision in such cases except by a reference to the war Cabinet.

Two of the questions concern the repatriation of German women and children and men over military age from East and South Africa, and the repatriation of German merchant Seamon from this country. These questions are complicated and would require some time to consider in all their bearings, and they are not of sufficient importance in my opinion to refer to the War Cabinet.

As a result of there being no Minister with a deciding voice in prisoner of war questions a great deal of correspondence is conducted between the various Departments without any result being arrived at. The consequence is that there is frequently on unnecessary delay, and I that the interests of British prisoners of war are gravely prejudiced, I think the time has  come when I should be empowered to settle such questions as involve no important political considerations, without reference to the War Cabinet, and to issue directions to the Departments of the War Office. Admiralty, and Home Office concerned as to the course  to be pursued. I realise that this suggestion can only be carried out with the consent of the Ministers in charge of those Departments and so? conflict of jurisdiction may be involved, but the present state of ? is so unsatisfactory that I think it is essential to provide for decisive action in certain prisoner of war questions without reference to the Cabinet.
