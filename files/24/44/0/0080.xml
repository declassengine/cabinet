 This Document is the Property 6t           247His Britannic (V?ajesty&apos;s Government)rfft T  5$W*,i?     CONTROL OF EEFPIGSPATED MEAT -  i^^^^^^    MEMORANDUM BY SIR ALBERT STAPLEY.     The position of the Board of Trade since early in 1915has been that they act as Agents of the War Offices of theBritish, French and Italian GoveraE&amp;ntc for the purchase ofsupplies of frosen beef and mutton for the Allied Troops.For this purpose the Board have entered into obligations withHew Zealand and the Australian Statos for the purchase of alltheir exportable output, and into contracts with the sevenprincipal meat packers of the Plats (Argentine and Uruguay)far tho purchase of not less than five-sixths of thoir suppliesin both cases for a period extending till three months aftertho termination of the war.   So much .jf the Australian muttonas is not required by tho Armies together with all the lamband also the remaining one-sixth of the Plate meat is broughtto the United iiingdom and made available through tho foQiOcntrcller for British civilian needs, but tho Board buy norefrigerated meat for French or Italian civilians.     While the above represent eur main sources of supply ithas been necessary from time to time to meet emergencies -mainly du* to shipping losses and delays - from nearer homeand the Board of Trade have had to make special purchases inCanada and the United States of America for the Armies.   Undertho Cabinet decision of last December all such purchases weretransferred to the Pood Controller on tho understanding thatArmy needs were still to have priority as they had previously.The two oargoos for Prance mentioned in Lord Rhondda?s memoran-dum were urgently required by the French Government  to meet a                                                   effectdeficiency in  their  supplies, representations to that/havingbeen                              (i)
made &quot;both to the Inter-Allied Meat &amp; Pats Executiveand to tho Board by the French Commission de Ravi-taillement.   To meet the Pood Controller it has beenarranged that the two ships from the United States ofAmerica originally proposed to be sent to Pranceshould bring their meat to the United Kingdom and thattwo later shipments should go in replacement to Prance.     The Board have not sent in any year either toPrance or Italy moat in excess - or indeed up to theagreed amounts - of our undertakings undor our Gon-ventions with tho Governments of those countries, butoccasionally a shortage in one month is made good inanother as in the case of the 2,300 tons named byLord Rhondda. and the needs of the Forces in thatcountry have of course been recently increased owingto tho presence there of considerable British andFrench troops.     The Board of Trade are in close touch with thoPood Controller - who has s representative on the-Shipping Committee which allocates insulated shipsaccording to the necessities of the moment at frequentmeetings - and also with hie representative on the Moat&amp; Fats Executive, and duo weight is given to the rcprc-sontations of his Department.     The question as to the Department which should infuture control the purchase of refrigerated moat appearsto be one entirely between the Pood Controller and theArmy Council.                                  A.H. STANLEY,                                     Board of Trade,                                        March 11th.,  1918.                         f p \
