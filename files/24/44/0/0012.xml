 Thfs Document Is the Property of                       f  g.-&apos;His Britannic Ftfajesty^s Government.           The Yfar Cabinet on the 22nd February approved  a  draft Regulation under     the Defence of the Realm Act making it an offence  for  a woman suffering     from a venereal disease in a communicable form to  have sexual intercourse     with any member of His Majesty1a Forces.    It  was  obvious that the     Regulation if made would be open to criticism  on the grounds (l) that the     penalties imposed would apply only io women and not  to men and (2) that     the Regulation would operate for the protection only of members of His     Majesty^ Forces and not of civilians? but it was considered that some     sdch Regulation was essential for preserving the health and efficiency of     the forces engaged in the war -  particularly of the  Colonial Forces.     There is no power under the Defence of the Realm Act to extend the     Regulation to the whole population;  this can  only be  done by legislation)     which would undoubtedly be opposed and would mean  considerable delay.           I now learn that the Secretary of State  for  War  feels considerable     doubt as to the policy of the Regulation  and its utility for the purpose     for which it was framed, and is  reluctant either to  defend or enforce it.     I also learn chat the Secretary of State  for the Colonies, on whose     proposal the Regulation was approved,  holds the view that the Regulation     falls within the sphere of civil administration, and that if questions     are raised in the. House the responsibility for the defence of the Regulation     must in the first instance devolve upon me.    I am unable to accept this     position.   If the matter is to be dealt  with  from the point of view of     civil administration it is plain that the Regulation cannot be defended in     its present form, and that the rule if made Bhould be  imposed by statute     upon the whole population.   It is only as a military  measure and from the     point of view of the defence of  the country that the prosposal is capable     of being defended;  and if the military authorities  do not approve or     desire the Regulation. I think it should  be abandoned.           In these circumstances I hope the War  Cabinet  will further consider     the matter.                                                   G. GAVE,5th March, 1918.
