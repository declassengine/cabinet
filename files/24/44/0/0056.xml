(This Document is the Property orHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmenSUMMARY. OF BLGO&amp;AM UitfQiCJLSlQliMarch 1-7, 1918.til.  iiUSSlA.s^,   Dana 2?he -ax-Governor oi&apos;  ifolhynia  states that  the  1917crops harvested in the Ukraine  ore at ill  virtuallvuntouehed.  the amount of  ^ruin which can actually  bemade available f orexport  from  the Ukraine is,  hosever^almost impossible to estimate.   Before the war  theUkraine, together with the annexed Polish provinces.produced some 30,000,000  tons of cereals;  but  this canhardly be taken us a caiide in estimating  the  1917 harvestIn 1915 the Eieff Mills received 50$  lees wheat andrye than in either of the  two preceedint   ears  and  in1916 they apparently received no corn  at  all.  Therewas a shortage in 1917 of  every iind  of agriculturalproduce in all the towns of the ukrdne.   All theavailable stocks disappeared  into the  private reservesof the fanners.  To  collect these reserves in presentconditions is lively to be  extremely  difficult.     \&apos;lo noted last wues that  there were  serious object-ions to the latest counter-proposals of the i)unishGovernment for an agreement with  the United states.  TheUnited L-tates Government have now informed the  DanishGovernment that they cannot accept these  proposals.  The;?&apos;particularly object to the refusal of  the  Danes  to bebound for more than six months, or to  put  on^ furtherShipping  into dangerous services.  Thoy are informingthe Janish Government that  further negotiations  willbe useletja unless Denmark consents (a) to  charter theships for which we are stipulating for  the duration ofthe war and (b) to e-llow l/Srd.  of the shippingallocated to the  United states  under the Agreement to

U&quot;;BM&amp;*      The Swedish Government have signed the provisioned           Agreement under ahioh Croat Britain and the United ;.Wtes           will obtain the use of a number of Swedish ships for allied           servicee,  Tho  terms  of this agreement were noted in u           previous Summary (January 25th to January 51st.)iH.   HQHiq.      The German Government are protesting strongly against           the ratification by Borw&amp;y of the Norwegian-American Agree-           raent.  -hey eompltdn that the agreement virtually prohibits           the export of Norwegian products to Germany,  The attitude           of the German Government is menacing.  They threaten to sink           Norwegian ships bringing supplies to Norway from the United           States im&amp; point out that certain Norwegian towns are within           easy roach of the German aircraft.                 The Borwegian Government propose to date their exports           of fish to Germany under the forthcoming agreement (4.000 tons           per month) aa from March 1st.  The exports will largely consist;           of dried and waited fish;  we have urged the United States           Government to insist that nuoh exports shall bo t&amp;tcen at the           !\fresh weight&quot; of the fish.  One hundred tons of sun-dried           fish represents four hundred tons of fresh fish, and therefore           our point is one of considerable Importance.                 The is or we gi an Government have granted the British           ,urchasing Agency licences- to export 15,000 tons of fresh           herrings in return for a&amp;reed cuian titles of salt.                 Tho German Government still insist upon receiving           a guarentes that my Dutch ships leaving Dutch ^orts will           return to Holland direct.  Thoy state that unless they           receive this guarantee they will blockade the  Initoh coast.           So long as the Dutch allow themselves to be overawed by
this threat they will  be unable either  to  aign the proposediener&amp;l Agreement with the Allies or  to carry out the termsof their provisional Shipping Agreement with the UnitesStates.  Tho United States Government have already released9 Butch veseela for the voyage to Holland under this Agree-raent;  but until they  ore sure that the Dutch Governmentwill release corresponding ships for the voyage to ;jnerieathey will not til low any further sailings.  The ProvisionalSnipping Agreement also remains unfulfilled by the Dutch  inregard to the employment of the Dutch ships in the UnitedStates Forts,  The United States Government desire to sendsome of these ships to the Argentine to load cex*eals forSwitzerland.  The Dutch shipowners are objecting to this andare insisting upon onerous terras for the use of their shipsIn the American coasting trade.      Unless the position is rapidly cleared up the allieswill shortly be compelled to requisition the Dutch shippingin Allied ,;orts.  The  United States Government have proposedthis step on their own Initiative, t-nd they will not delaytheir action very lon *       Government have also consideredand approved the step  and the Dutch Government have beenwarned,  fir. Loudon hae stated that the requisitioning ofDutch ships by the Allies would arouse very strong resentmentin Holland,  fe have proposed to the Dutch Government, us analternative to requisitioning * that they should guarantee todeliver to the Allies  the shipping due to them under theproposed General Agreement before March lltlu  The Allieswould undertake in return to out 100,000 tony of cereals atthe disposal of the Dutch in a United States Port beforeApril 1ftth.      Sir f. Townley does not think that the Dutch oan longpostpone a settlement.  Mr. louden has stated that unlessthe Dutch ships in Holland can sail within the next fort-
                                                     4.ni^ht they will not return to ho11and In time to relievethe food position.  She killed Ministers at the Hagueappear to think that the Dutch will hold the German Govern-raent responsible for their hardships if the German Govern-raent refuse to allow these vessels to sail.  Mr. -uoudonstill hopes to persuade the Germans to abandon theirpresent attitude.      She transit question has this week been temporarilysettled by the action of the German Government.  The Dutchhad decided not to allow any further transit of German sandand gravel through Holland to the Occupied Territory untila Dutch Commission had been allowed to make a thoroughinvestigation in Belgium and northern France.  The GermanGovernment have informed the Dutch Government that Inpresent circumstances they cannot admit such a Commissioninto the Occupied Territory and that in order to avoid anyfurther difficulties they will not require the transittraffic to be resumed after March 15th.  They reserve ,however, the right to reopen the question.      The Dutch Government propose to control very strictlythe export of Dutch sand and gravel to Belgium.  Exportswill only be allowed under licence and the finul destinationof the materials will have to be declared.  Mr. i*oudon sta-tes that no further exports can be permitted for sometime, as the Dutch will need all their av&amp;iluble suppliesfor home requirements.  We note, however, that ver^nearly 100.000 tons of sand and gravel of Dutch origin wereexported to Belgium between February 9th and i&apos;*ebruary20th.      The Swiss Government have made a general appeal-to the  Hies to do their utmost to assist Switzerlandwith cereals  aid raw materials for Swiss industries.  A
                                                              -     171                                                                    5.                similar appeal may possibly be sent to the Germans, who                are understood to be ready to help Switzerland if it                should be necessary,                      Tno uppeal of the Swiss Government has greatly                impressed the united States state -Department, who urge                that immediate steps be tLiken to fulfil the American                Swiss Agreement,   he United States Authorities have                so far arranged to export 40,000 tons of the wheat due                to the Swiss under this Agreement, but on&amp;y 17,000 tons                have actually been shipped.  *2hey propose that the                Inter-Aiiied Wheat Executive should deliver another                SO.000 tons during March and that the Inter-Allied                Chartering Executive should find at least 50,000 tons                dead weight of shipping to lift Argentine wheat for                Switzerland between now and August,   hey would them-                selves be responsible for another 50,000 tons.                      We have ourselves already had to face this                Question of providing tonnage for Swiss supplies in                our negotiations for a British loan in Switzerland.                We cannot give the Swiss any definite assurance as to the                amount of tonnage we can provide, and we have had to                inform our Minister at Berne that, if the Swiss insist                on an actual guarantee, we shall have to abandon the                negotiations.87.
