I. - THE  LAW.     from the attached Memorandum &quot;by tho Cenoral  Staff it will besufficiently clear that the question of what are  legitimate  object-ivos for bombing aircraft cannot bo determined by Article 25 of theland War Convention of 1907*;  This Article is the only  Internationalrule which touches the: question-of aircraft bombardment,&apos;  It forbidstho bombardment ,of undo!ended- towns, --villages, - dwellings or.&quot; build,-ings &quot;by -arry-means /whatever&quot;, -words which/were vci reesly insertedto covor attacks-by Jaiircr-aft * --as \\&apos;:&apos;  A- &apos; - - &apos; a-    t*  v.;..u  .&quot;n      *u. &apos;  *  * lew-II         W-  -;          &apos;    ; ;     Though tho Convention was signed and ratified by nearly ail thePowers now at War,0 tho latitude of interpretation which the word&quot;undefended&apos;1 admits of renders it nugatory for the present purpose.As the General Staff points out it is therefore necessary to go upongeneral principles*     The only rule that can be said, to have long  prescriptive author-ity is tho old one that no placo should be bombarded, unless, in theface of enemy forces ready to attack it &quot;in form&quot; it had refused tosurrender,,     Such a rule is obviously too narrow to bo accepted under modernconditions of warfare  and a wider latitude has already boon recognisedby express convention  for naval bombardment, and it is to navalpractice  rather than to military that it seems natural to look for theprinciples that should govern aircraft.  The conditions of aorialwarfare,  owing especially to tho range and mobility of aircraft, areftuoh more closely analogous to the conditions of tho sea than tothose of  tho land.     Article 1 of tho  Convention of 1907 relating to $aval Bombard-inonts,  which was similarly ratified,  also forbids tho bombardment of&quot;undefended0 places, but article 2 materially modifies the prohibition,as follows :-     &quot;Military works,  military, or naval establishments, depots of   arms or war material,.. workshops or plant which could bo utilised   for the needs of a  hostile fleet or army, and ships of war in the   harbour arc not  included in this prohibition&quot;.     If so much latitude is allowed to ships there seems no reason    it should not be claimed for aircraft,  especially as it did noacre than embody the traditional practice.     Traditional practice however had always placed a certain res-triction  upon a bombardment of this cliise of objective  and this was-xprossly retained,  Tho Article further providej that  &quot;a navalcommander may destroy  them v/ith artillery,  after a summons followedby a reasonable interval of time,  if  all other moans arc impossible,&amp;nd When  tho local  authorities have not themselves destroyed them ithin the time fixed&quot;, To tho ortont of this proviso it is obvious                                                       that aircraftIjTiJJq&quot;^^                                               e,  Japanf   Roumania,  Portugal,  Belgium,  France,  Russia,  Italy and others.
1  I Iaircraft bombardment of %ha kind under consideration cannotbe justified on the principle of the Article, but it isequally obvious that to insist on such a proviso for aerialbombardmentawould be to disallow then altogether.II. - THE PACTS.!S w &amp; oi (*- w u is (* a ss o c *     Up till the end of 1914 all bombing raids both of theAllies and the Enemy were confined to objectives coveredby the Naval Article,  During thtf year we attacked therecognised fortresses of DUSSELDORF and COLOGNE and Um AAgshipFactory at MEDRICHSHAPEN.  The first of these attackswhich mm at DUSSELDORF took place on September 22nd,Previously to this PARIS, LUNtVILLE, GHENT and ANTWBRP, whichat the time was not being besieged, had been attacked fromthe air by the Germans.     It wag not till January 1915 when Zeppelin raids onthis country were initiated that objectives began to be fcttasked^which were obviously not cohered by the principle of the JfavalArticle.  luring the first raid, January 19th/20th, two inlandvillages in Norfolk,HBACHAM and SHETT1SHAM, were bombed, andthis became a regular feature of the rfefede.  During that ofApril 29th/30th bombs were dropped from a military airshipon no less than eight such villages.     In the raid which took place on May 26th there was afurther departure from at least the. spirit of. the Article, .;inaugurated by the new military airshipa.  On this occasionone of these ehipa1 dropped twenty-three small; man-killing bombs6n; SOUTHSHXJV ; Similar proceedinge marked the first raid onLONDON ft few days later.  It was carried out&apos; by Hauptmann Lianasin the military airship  SL,Z.38BB  On this occasion besidesincendiary bombs thirty  5-lb9 grenades useless for destroyingmilitary works, etc   were dropped in the East 2nd of  theMetropolis.  ?ros April&quot;  onwards there were also numerous casesof bombing  country towns ,  such as MALDOH, DRIFJIELD, TUNER IDOL&apos;WELLS which contained no military objects of importance withinthe meaning of the $aval Article.     &apos;      l-&apos;-.. .    ...     In Germany no secret     mn.it of the fact that In theseoperations the 7object. of, the General Staff ym. not to  destroymilitary  establishmentsbut to terrorise the civil population.The attacks &apos;on LOHDOU they nerertheleBs justified on the plea tWttit was a :defended town :and;as such  could,be lawfully bombardedby any means whatever, nor does it  seem possible to rebut thiscontention  completely,&quot;for although it may not be strictly *defended  place, it is a  place liable to bombardment under theNaval Convention.  -
      ;  After,this,. grenade dropping stopped, but in subsequentraids the bombing of villages- in the open country which &quot;couldnet be justified. ,ee-.de.r: either the ITaval. or the Military Conventioncontinued to be the,-rpjmeon practice,; both of naval and militaryairships up to 11: e,:.* Attempt in October 1917*   In the raid onSeptember 24th/25th of that year Tillages were hombed indaylight when the agricultural nature, of&apos;the country was apparent *During the.last Zeppelin raid of all on October&quot;19th/20th, 1917,a &quot;larger number of villages than ever before were attacked overa very extended area of &quot;open countryv        Subsequent raids by aeroplanes were as a rule, but notentirely, confined to objectives which might be claimed aslegitimate under the principle of the Kaval Convention.        The first raid of which tho Germans complainad was a3*rench raid on May 27th, 19^5* against the chemical factoriesnear LUWIGSHAFEft and MA17EHSIM, objectives clearly within thoITaval Article.   Tho next was on June 15th of the same year uponKARLSRUHE also by French airmen, and was officially announcedby the French to be &quot;a reprisal for the bombardment by the Germans!!of open French and British towns.&apos;1   KARLSRUHE, though claimed bythe Germans to be an open towht far from the theatre of operationshad a regular garrison and an arme factory and was thereforealso covered by the ITaval Article.        On June 22nd, 1916, KARLSRUHE and KAI7KKEIM wars againbombed by French airmen in reprisal for recent German raids onthe &quot;open&quot; towns of BAR-LB-PUG and LUHSSVILLS, b*th certainlylegitimato objectives as being places of military importance.        Our own first raid announced a-q &amp;. reprisal was thatmade on April 14-th, 1917, upon PREIBCHG in retaliation for thesinking of hospital ships.   The Germans officially protestedthat it was an &quot;open town&quot;, containing no military objectsimportant enough to justify the attack, though the protestadmitted tho presence of soldiers and anti-aircraft guns.In the same commimiquS they complained of the, attacks ondefenceless villages in South Germany without specifying datesor places.   They also repeated their complaint of the raid onKARLSRUHE the previous June.        Up to this time two points come out clearly:            (l)   There is no kind of agreement as to the        moaning of an &quot;open&quot; town, and therefore of what is        a &quot;defended&apos;5 town within the meaning of the Conventions,        and            (2)   The Allies have confined themselves to        objectives of military importance within the moaning of        the Naval Convention except for the alleged, but        unspecified, attacks on villages In South Germany.        From the commencement of the war our airmen I ad definiteorders to refrain from attacking undefended towns and villages,and so far as is known, they have confined themselves eversince to bombing aerodromes, bivouacs, munition dumps, factories,railways and other objectives of military importance behindtho enemy&apos;s lines,        It is to bo observed also that our raids on townshave boen made in the main by daylight when it was possibleto distinguish special military objectives, whereas those                                                of
of the Germans were nearly all made at night when the damagecaused could only be indiscriminate.                     IllCONCLUSIONS.         From the foregoing statement of the law, such as itis, and the facts, it would seem that apart from tfce Germanprovocation of grenade dropping and attacks on country villagesno question of reprisal arises.        &quot;Reprisals&quot; connote retaliation for illegal acts, andin the existing state of International Law no Indisputableillegality can be charged against the Germans since their air-ship attacks ceased.  The few cases there may be of villagesbeing bombed by aeroplanes may have been accidentale         It is submitted therefore that our real position, ifretaliation on &quot;open&quot; German towns is contemplated, is this:iJrat although we have been reluctant to extend the principleof naval bombardments to aerial bombardments of objectivessituated in or near centres of population, yet the enemyf spersistent and reckless indulgence in this practice forces usunder protest to act on their view of what Is legitimate.         In reply to the special question as to who beganattacks on &quot;open&quot; towns it can only be said that ws have neverattacked towns which could be considered as &quot;undefended&quot;within the meaning of the two Conventions or which did notcontain objectives of military importance within the meaningof M&amp;ie &apos;&amp;a^al;&apos;Conv:enf^    The Germhe- on the ;ot,her&apos;;hahd didi^e^e^s^dt^ntl^-id^                      of their Zeppelin raidWhitehall Gardens * S.W.I.

The development of the air arm is of such recent data thatit is not surprising that the legislation in regard to theof aircraft bo&amp;be is very scanty^   The Hague Declaration of1899 prohibited combatants from launching projectiles orexplosives from balloons or other kinds of aerial vessels, butit was only made operative for a period of five years;  at theHague Conferenoe of 1907 a further Declaration was drafted forthe purpose of renewing the 1899 Declaration, but it was onlysigned by 87 out of the 44 Powers represented, and was ratifiedby none of the present belligerents except Great Britain, theUnited States, Portugal and Belgium,   Moreover it containsan express provision that it shall cease to be binding when,in a war between the Contracting Powers, one of the belligerentsis joined by a non-Contracting Power:  accordingly it has nobinding force in the present war,           In order, therefore, to arrive at any regulative principle      it is necessary to have regard to the established laws of war-      fare in general, and to the Hague Hegulations governing land and      naval bombardment in particular.Jele 25,    By these regulations the bpmb&amp;r&amp;ment of undefended places  to  is forbidden both from laud and sea;  in neither case, however,IHag&amp;s is the precise meaning of 1undefended&apos; given.Fsn- of                                                                          1[Hague      This point was discussed at the Conference, but no\m-   definition was agreed either in regard to land or naval bom- of   bar&amp;msnt, owing, in the latter case, to the difficulty of      drawing a distinction between the defence of a coast and of 1,   a town near the coast* s de2oa-        As regards the application of tb&amp;se regulations to2Bce   bombardment from the air, it is to be no tod that tho.106 &amp; Convention regarding land warfare forbids the attack or      bombardment of undefended places by sayi ggans whatever      and that tho words underlined weroinserfeS&quot;&apos; express iy&quot;to.B58   oovor attack from the air.   The Convention in regard to      naval warfare, probably owing to an oversight, contains no      such words.           The definition of an undefended town has always presented      some difficulty.           The Manual of Military law takes the view that the      bombardment or attack by any means whatever of undefended      towns, villages and buildings, whether fortified or not, is      forbidden.   It lays down that the fsot that a town contains      supplies of value to the er&amp;my, or railway establishments,      telegraphs, or bridges does not confer the right of bombard-      meat, but that these objects must be destroyed, if it is      necessary to de so, by other means*   That is to say that the      hostile commander may not employ bombardment for the purpose      of inducing  the surrender cf an undefended town;  but if he      enters it, he is at liberty to destroy these objects.  A locality      which is not fortified may yet be  * defended;;  for example it may      be considered &quot;defended7 If a military force is in occupation of or      marching through it*  A fortress or other fortified place is prima
facie considered to be &apos;defended&apos;. It may be bombarded unless there are visible signs of surrender: but if it is bombarded, steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible buildings dedicated to public worship, art, science or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and ? are collected. These objects must be indicated by distinctive and visible signs to be notified to the enemy beforehand; but this provision is a totally insufficient protection against ? by aircraft.

Professor Holland, writing in May 1914, goes further and maintains that a great centre of population is prima facie undefended, altough it contains barracks, stores and even bodies of troops. He holds that a place prima facie undefended ceases to possess that character as soon as access to it is forcibly denied to the land forces of the enemy, but not if it merely declines &apos;to submit to the dictation of two men in an aeroplane&apos;. He admits however that the Hague Convention of 1908 is ambiguous and considers that, in the absence of more precise rules, the only safe course for any town is to take such measures as wholly to forfeit such claim as it may in ordinary times possess to be considered an undefended town.

The German General Staff on the other hand argue that the sole criterion as to the legality of a bombardment is whether the place possesses a military value to the enemy at the time, and consider the insertion in Article 25 of the Hague Convention of words "by any means whatever" to be superfluous as modern military history knows of hardly any case where open towns and village not occupied by the enemy or defended.

All the jurists, however, appear to have considered this question solely from the point of view of defence against land and naval forces, and not to have contemplated the development of aerial warfare and the consequent armament of places, otherwise totally undefended, against aerial attack.

The legality of bombarding undefended towns from the air was recently considered in connection with the liability of the German Government to pay compensation in respect of the early raid on this country. On that occasion the War Office expressed the that the distinction between &apos;defended&apos; and &apos;undefended&apos;, originally made in regard to land and naval bombardment, was inapplicable to modern warfare; and they recommended with the approval of the D.G.M.A. that, in the absence of any appropriate legilsation on the subject, the matter should be regulated solely by considerations of expediency. From this standpoint they thought that all air raids upon places for the defence of which no guns other than anti-aircraft guns are mounted should be regarded as contravening the laws of war.

Thus it is seen that the existing Conventional legilsation on the subject of aerial bombardment is totally inadequate to meet the present condition of aerial warface, and it is therefore necessary to act in conformity with the principles of International Law.

Unless the principles applicable to land or naval bombardment are not to be applied also to bombardment from the air, a place be regarded as &apos;defended&apos; and therefore liable to bombardment from the air if access to it is denied to the land forces of the enemy. But, just as a merchantman is not converted into a warship by the fact of carrying a gun for defensive purposes, so the presence of anti-aircraft defences, it is submitted, would not alone sufficiently deprive an undefended place of that character.

According to a strict interpretetion of the law, therefore, the bombardment from the air of an undefended town or of any military work in that town appears to be prohibited; and indeed without such a prohibition it would be impossible to secure the immunity to which the civil population and hospitals and other protected buildings are entitled to at the hands of belligerents.


254      Another jpoe&amp;iblc  view,  skich the- German Government appear to h^vXd^ is tha^ tho  AosircajrkSjm&apos; of objects of military value  in onomyI torrrt^i-y^  whorovor situated,  is legitimate-.  This theory wouldjinvolve  the contention that  the  distinction made between defended and undefended places  in  regard  to land and naval bombardment is inapplicable to aerial warfare,  and would prejudice the safety of private  individuals and protected ^buildings.      Tho  recent development  of the air  arm affords a striking instance  of tho sciontific advance in the  mechanism of armaments foreshadowed in the preamble of  the ot.  Petersburg Declaration of 1868.   The intention  was then oxpreeaed of convening furthermeetings  to reconcile  the advance  of science in  regard to armamentswith  tho  dictates  of humanity, and indeed  tho  Institute of  Intor-national  Law meeting at Lladrid in  1911 adopted the  principle  thataorial warfare  must  not comprise greater danger  to  the  person andthe property of the  peaceful population  than land or  sea warfare.      In short,  the  question to what extent  aerial bombardmentundor modern conditions is Lawful  seems  open to  legitimate  doubtand appears to  be eminently one for mutual  agreement  between  thebelligerents.GE&amp;SML STAFF,      WAR OFFICE,          7.3.18.H.1.6.X.2 7*
