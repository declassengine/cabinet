&apos; This Document is the Property of    AHis Britannic SV1ajesty&apos;s Government.)HOME  PROPAGANDA.       MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER.     I have fes^. Lord Beaverbrook s memorandum of 22nd Februarybut do not think that any  advantage woe Id be gained by thesuggested transfer to the Ministry of Information of the propagandawork of this Department,   Our present system works satisfactorily .rand the space given to the food question in the London and Provincialnewspapers is as much as the Food Mnistry can reasonably expectin. view of the restricted space available in war time.   Theattitude of the Press has, moreover, with few exceptions, beensingularly sympathetic when regard, is had to the numerous andinfluential vested interests with which the Ministry, in the perform-ance of its duties,can hardly fail to come into conflict.     Statutory Orders and official announcements areissued through the Press Bureau;  in addition to this, thePublicity Director has conversations every day with representa-tives of the Press on points of interest or of difficulty:  Pressconferences are periodically held to meet the Food Controlleror the principal officers;  mis-statements in newspapers arecorrected by means of letters to the Editors, and special articlesare inspired by means of interviews or written suggestions.   TheNational Food Journal, which Is the official organ of the Ministry,circulates chiefly among Food Control Committees, and officialscharged with the administration of the Food Controller!s Orders,but from 20/000 to 50,000 copies are sold every month.  ThisJournal has been welcomed by the Press - for example,- the currentnumber of the &quot;Sphere&quot; photographs Its front page and exhorts allreaders to buy it.While/J
     While, then, the present system works well, the suggestedtransfer would net, in my opinion, give such good results.    Nosatisfactory propaganda could be carried out by anyone who  wasnot in daily and almost hourly touch with the Department-, and thecontrol of this work could not be centralised without loss  ofefficiency.     Pood Administration has involved a multiplicity of Orders.and instructions^ and no one outside the Ministry could possiblyassimilate these in such a way as to deal promptly with thedetailed policy of the Food Controller.   The explanatoryinformation daily given to journalists, which forms an importantpart of our propaganda, must be given by an Officer stationed inand directly responsible to the Department, and similarly,  thearticles which appear by arrangement in the newspapers could onlybe inspired from within..     It is obvious that all Press Notices and articles must beprepared in the Department; to pass these through anotherDepartment for issue would needlessly warrant the imputationof dual control.     In short, the present system is economical and, I submit,quite satisfactory, and I cculd not agree to the change suggested                                         PdiONDDA.MINISTRY OF FOOD, 4th March, 1918,
