TRANSLATION CP MESOAGE PROM THE ITALIAN PRESIDENT OP    THE COUNCIL TO THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER,               FEBRUARY 25th,     In reply to the communication received from YourExcellency, received through His Britannic Majesty&apos;8Ambassador, I hasten to inform you that nothing couldhe more agreeable to the Italian Government than to beable to accede to a r^uest put forward by: the BritishGovernment for a matter of high common interest..     I must, however,earnestly beg Your Excellency toexamine with the most benevolent consideration the f ol-lowing points,     When the French Government asked us to supplysixty^thousand labourers (who, added to the forty-thousand who are already in France, make a total of ahundred thousand) the Italian Government began by o&quot;b*serving that the deficiency of labour in Italy was notsensibly less than that in France,   And in fact, tak-ing into account the number of classes under arms andof the exceptionally high figures of emigration ofItalians to America, it can be said that the percentageof labour remaining available in Italy- is not superiorto that remaining in France *     The best practical demonstration of the absolute-deficiency of available labour is seen in the factthat, to accede to the request of the French GovernmentItaly was compelled to have recourse to militarylabour, sending to work on the French Front sixtythousand fighting men.     This was a very great sacrifice which Italy im-                                              posed
imposed upon herself;  but she did not think that inthe circumstances it was possible to do less.     To-day the Italian Government have neither civilnor rrilitary labour to dispose of, while it would be agreat disadvantage to the common cause to convert&quot;fighting men into labourers.   This difficulty seerrsthe more obvious in so much as at the present momentall the Allied Governments have agreed at Versaillesto contribute to the formation of a reserve, and theItalian Government therefore, by recalling the sixtythousand men at present on the French Front and armingand enrolling them, could have at their disposal-alarger military force which would increase the numberof troops available for the formation of a reserve.     Further, the Italian Government would observethat in the spirit of the above-mentioned concessionmade to the French Government of sixty-thousand menit is manifestly understood this exceptional contribu-tion of military labour is for the service of theunited British and French Front..   In this last caseit is not clear what practical utility there can be inmaking a distinction between the French and BritishArmies as it is obvious that the improvement in the defences of one army is to the benefit of the other andvice versa.   The Italian Government therefore declarethat for their part these men were not considered asdestined for that section of the front occupied atpresent by French troops., but for the whole united                                            -ie stern
Western front occupied by French and British troops,The Italian Government hold therefore that the BritishGovernment have full risht to demand from the French-Government the services of a portion of these men, andfor their part the Italian Government are ready to sup-port such a demand as being consistent with the spiritin which they made this concession?     Finally I have to inform Your Excellency that atthe last meeting at Versailles the chief of the Ameri-can General Staff made me a similar request and I wascompelled to reply to him in the same terms as above:-     1,   That there is already an absolute deficiencyof labour in Italy;     2*   That the concession of military labour madeto France represented the extreme limit short ofdemobilising military units actually serving;     3.*   That the concession made to France was madewith the intention of being of service to the wholeFront defended by the French, British and Americans *
