CAP&apos;iv    ---&apos;------       In view of the situation created by the collapse of ussia and of the two main objectives of the enemy,  i.e. theexploitation of Russian resources and the penetration formilitary purposes of Central Asia, it is vitally necessarythat Allied policy in the East no less than In the Westshould be regarded from the standpoint of the single front.2.     In spite of the fact that the British share Inmilitary and foreign policy in the East has been predominantand that consequently the necessity for delays inseparablefrom inter-ally consultation is largely absent, importantmeasures have been rendered Impossible or delayed with graveconsequences by the lack of co-ordination involved by thepresent machinery.       The existing machinery consists of !-           (a) The Russian committee,           (b) The Persian committee,           (c) The Middle East committee.       The above committees meet nominally about once a week,but in practice meetings are liable to be postponed owing topressure of work of individual members.   The composition,status and executive powers of these committees vary.       Their very existence has led the War Cabinet  to treatsuch questions as that of Japanese intervention, Britishaction in Russia and the Caucasus, British policy In Persiaand British policy In Mesopotamia and Egypt&apos; as Isolatedproblems, rather than as vitally interdependent.       It is  submitted that an Eastern Committee should beformed under  the presidency of a Minister of the Crown with                                                  executive
executive functions similar to those no?/ possessed by theRussia Committee (which has achieved a general speedingup between Government Departments concerned) to deal withall matters short of decisions of general policy.   Itshould be one of the duties of the Committee to presentsuch schemes of general policy when duly co-ordinated forthe decision of the War Cabinet.        It Is suggested that the Committee should meetregularly at such intervals as the President may decidebut that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should beauthorised to ask the President to call meetings wheneverthe military situation calls for prompt action.   TheProceedings of the Committee should be circulated to theTar Cabinet and to all Departments concerned.General Staff,    War Office.(Sd.)Henry Wilson.        C.I.G.S.
