IS TIG PROPERTY 0? HIS. BT..IM^ie lAk3&amp;z&apos;l!Y*!i GQV$:..uAmawAR GAB&apos;BET.     I have received from Lord Rothermere the foil owing Bepori enthe organisation in France of anti-submarine aoastal patrols byaeroplanes.     The Secretary of State for Air statos that he considers thematter of the utmost importance.     A system of coastal patrols fcy  aeroplanes was  started  in Franceat the beginning of 191?, and  is now nearly  completed.    The re-stats attained by this patrol  have been highly successful,  ana  itcan be assumed that there is now practically no more sinking ofships in the daytima alongside and within  15 or 20  miles  of theFrench. coasta   The charts  issued weekly show tact  all the  patrolledarea is practically devoid  of  submarine attaoks.    Those  shown  onthese maps being- entirely at night and very  few in  number *  The?ronoh fishermen who bad ceased entirely to  go out  with their boatsas they ^ere Yery frequently attacked in broad daylight with machineguns or gxm&amp; by German submarines have now entirely resumed theirwork and hsvs oven lost the thought of possible attack.   Ho sinkingof ships sailing in oenroys occurs now in  this area in the  daytime,as the weekly reports show.        The French sea-frontage has been divided into sections of   roughly 60 miles front&amp;go, each one slightly overlapping the   neighbouring sectionsf and being in the charge of one squadron,   The depth patrollod is as far as 15 miles out at sea.  &quot;occasion-   ally if a oofcvoy of ships is to tbe protected it may be extended   a little further,   Bach section is divided into numerous sub-   sections, easy to spot from out at soa by land alignments suoh as   capes,  church towers, etc., and carefully drawn and numbered on   aaoh pilot*s maps.   Saoh squadron consists of eight pilots including   the flight-commander.   These pilots are generally chosen from among   those who have suffered from nerve or altitude fatigue at the front   as tho  height at which patrols are made aces not exceed 2000 feet.   Each squadron has 12 complete machines with Bpares,  a wireless station   and a station of SO carrier pigeons.   The staff includes ono aeohanie^  and one aosistant psr machine,  three wireless operators,  and two men   for the pigeons.        The machines used are land machines,  and this  is the  key to tho   success of these patrols.  Ta^^m^KIma must be used instead of   seaplanes for the following reasons:-        (A)   A fairly large number of machines must bo  available quickly   and as  there is  no question of  epeed or  climb required it  is  possible   tc  use  sasbines  having become obsolete at  the front.(Sd)   2 .P,A,Eankey.2, Whitehall Gordons,       11th March, 1918,ffggBRAS CROAK18AfflQN.
B)    It  is necessary  to  establish  In  a  short  tins  a  numberof bases regularly placad  along  the coast.   It  is  always  easyto establish  quickly  and cheaply and  practically anywhere anaerodrome for land machines;  whereas a seaplane base  requiresa specially sheltered place like a cove or harbour which  canonly  be  found in a vary  few places, and necessitates the  buil* - ing  of  slips, hoisting  apparatus, special sheds.  etc.,0)    More Important still  is  the reason that  land  machinascan fly  iu practically any weather, especially  over  the sea atlow altitudes.  They  can always  take  off and  land  easily  in awind  which would make the  sea fer  too rough to  allow of sea-pianas starting and lauding safely.   Besides, a land machine beidevoid of heavy and bulky  floats is always aerodynamic&amp;llybetter centred end much  more  easy  to  handle in  rough weather,D)    Hot carrying floats a land  machine is able to liftmuch  more weight with a  given engine  than a seaplane,  consequentthe necessary load of bombs or armament, wireless  apparatus,etc,can be carried en lead machines  of comparatively small horse-power, which enables  tho use  of  obsolete types  of  engine  in asmuch  ss  it is never necessary ta go to  any great height,      The only drawback to  land machines for this use  is  therisk  involved by engine  failure, but  it may bt  assumed that thisrisk  is very small    engines nowadays  are very reliable^  Theyare subjected to very little  a trails during these patrols  as,there balng no question  of speed,  it  is always  possible to flywith  half throttle.   The machines  nover go very far  from  thecoast, and being fitted  with  wireless can ask for  help and berescued  in a oompsxdfo.vely  short  time,   Also it  may be  assumed tbif the sea is even very  little rough  a  small li&amp;ht sesplans isVtry  likely to crssh  when  force-landing on th^  sea.  Besidesall these risks are now  obliterated by  the use  of  the  deviceinvented by COi*MJLHDEB BU3T33D, which, fitted to land maohines,enables thsm to float safely  for a very long time  even in roughweather.  To tske the full benefit of this device  it should onlybt necessary to provide  the machines  with a small  emergencycollapsible mast and  light battery which would  allow them tosend  wireless signals while floating.                   Tim  Os  U0HI33 USED.      The beet type of secbine for  this  kind of  work  is a usher*  It if indeed sbsolutely compulsory for the  observer tosee oefors he is s^en.   He has to watch the whole herizon andthe whole area and net a given point  or line ea is the case inland  observation.  Consequently  he must have a  very  clear Yiewover  the widest possible are  and below, and these -conditionscannot    fulfilled in tractors.   It  is suggested  that amongEnglish, machines the jTJB*  would  bs moat suitable.   This machineaffords s perfect view,  is not tiring to fly, which  would allowof Ion,, patrols, and  angina with 160 h,p* B&amp;&quot;JSB 0?.B  or a  similarmotor would easily carry the  necessary  load.            EQUXPMEHT 0^ MACHINES     POLICY Of                         PATROLS.                      *l exit M* 41 tft*f*4  M      patrols are made by two  machines flying in peirs*   InFrance where we use VOISI-Fmachines each pair is made of  onebomb  carrier and wireless machine, and one gun-plsnt.   The firsmachine carries two 140  bombs of a special type and  powerful wir&quot;loss  equipment both for  transmitting  and receiving.  Ike secondplane carries a 37 m/ra l  pounder gun of high aussle velocity,fitted with &amp; special sight for  firing  downwards.  xhis si^ht hasShortly to be replaced by twin-engined CAUDROB (110 h.p.La Hhone) and twin Eiaoano (LET^OED.)
22b- 3 -iix)8l^9fTQfetive^^    a copy of tests made on sea targets is attached to  this report.    (These tests were made in practical flight by an  ordinary pilot  and gunner of one of these squadrons).   The two machines patrol their area in a zigzag course.   If they Sight&quot;a submarine or anything that looks suspicious both machines make at  full speed for  the place at which it was seen, the gun machine firing as scon as  it is within reach and the bomber in the meantime sending by wireless the exact bearings of where it was located, always roferring to the land alignments specified above.   If the patrol picks up a mine, the gun plane tries to  blow It up, tne other machine in the meantime seziding the exact bearings, then circling round over it and keeping it in  sight until a patrol boat comes and destroys it.         In case of scouting a convoy of ships, the machines always follow the  convoy by making huge circles over and around it.   When they have completed their time of flighty machines from the neighbouring squadron come and replace them.        If anything is reported from the land, information is  sent to the patrolling machines by wireless and they are told to make immediately for the given point or area in which they are believed  to be neeced.    In such case . two other machines start immediately to take their place for the standard patrol.         In order  to increase the offensive qualities of such aeroplanes, a new automatic gun is actually being designed, with a bore of 3&quot;.   This gun weights 560 lbs.,, and fires a shell of special design, weighing 14 lbs. with a muzzle velocity of over 1350 feet-second.    The shell fitted with a special base fuse9 after perforating a plate \ inch thick, easily destroys a  second armour plate 1 inch thick made of special steel and  placed 3 feet beyond the first one.   Any submarine hit by such a shell should suffer damages severe enough to  render it unable to dive and consequently become an easy prey to  patrolling destroyers.(Signed)    L.  PIERROH.
