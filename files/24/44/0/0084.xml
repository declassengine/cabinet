    s Document is the Property ofHis Britannic SViajesty*s Government.)QoJbaei J       . w -1---,--- ..e -fey the Minister of lie const ruction on the draft Bill(G*fe  3830) and the Memorandum by Mr, Hayes Fisher attached51  thereto.1.      I  observe  that  Mr.  Hayes  Fisher states  in his  coveringMemorandum  that the Bill  as  now  circulated is  in the  formaccepted  by the Committee of Ministers to  which it  wasreferred  for consideration.2,      I  feel bound to place on  record and  to  bring to  thenotice  of the War Cabinet the points  in the Bill to which Ihave repeatedly drawn  attention  as being objectionable  inprinciple and certain  to  arouse  controversy in Parliament.5.      2ho  areas  for which it is proposed  that local  authoritiesshould  act  under  the Bill  are novel in sige and  depart  fromthe compromise embodied in the Bducation Act,  1902.   I  thinkthat opposition to the Bill  will be aroused on this ground.4.      The  Bill enables Rural District  Councils  to  act  asauthorities for the purposes which it  covers,    his proposalwill excite determined opposition from the  representatives ofthe Health  Insurance organisations,5.      Tho  existing unregulated  competition between the healthauthorities  in charge  of local services  has made  it necessaryto exclude  from the Bill  the provision  of proper  andsufficient  medical attendance and treatment in the home.  Thismarks most  clearly the fact  that the establishment of aMinistry  of nealth is  the  necessary condition of anyeffective measure ox health  reform.  Ehe first duty of such aMinistry  should be to work out a proper  scheme for the futureadministration/

I have proceeded&quot; so far with the negotiations for theestablishment of a Ministry of health that I should be ablewithin the next week or two to submit substantially agreedproposals on the subject to the War Cabinet.7*     In the meantime I would strongly deprecate theintroduction of the Maternity m Chile: Welfare Bill, which islikely to have the effect of seriously prejudicing thesenegotiations.8.     If, however,  it is thought proper to introduce the Billin advance of the conclusion ol these negotiations, I wouldurge that the Government should announce at the same timetheir intention of introducing legislation as speedily aspossible for the establishment of a Ministry of Health. , Theeffect of introducing the Maternity &amp; Child Welfare Billwithout any such declaration will be, I fear, to arousecontroversy which will imperil the passage both of thepresent measure and of any measure proposed in future forsecuring the Ministry of health, which alone can dealsystematically with the health services of the Country.
