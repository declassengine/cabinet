The statement mado then that no more doctorswould be available after September must bo qualified by the phrase&quot;except as replacements, so far as circumstances allow, for thosereturning to civil practice1.1.    The correctness of this statementhas been established by the experience of the Committee as set forthin the following paragraphs.      E. The demands foreshadowed by Sir James Galloway in a roughestimate submitted by kirn to the Committee on 1st February, 1918,would involve the withdrawal from civilian practice of from 700 to900 msdical practitioners in the year 1918.      3* The Committee is of opinion that the withdrawal of aconsiderable number of civil practitioners such as may bo involvedin this estimate is impossible for tho follov&amp;ng reasons .:-      (a) The efforts ox the Committoo to supply medical officers          for the Services from August to December, 1917 (inclusive)          resulted in diminishing the general practitioners of          England and &quot;.*&apos;ales by 48 only.   On August, 1st, 1917, there          were in England and Wales 11,530 general practitioners.          On January 1st, 1918, in spite of all the efforts of tho          Committee there wore in general practice 11,482 practitioner          that is to say, 48 less than five months previously.                The proof of the contention that this figure of 11,482          marks approximately the attainment of tho final limit of          depletion of the profession in present circumstances is to          be found by a consideration of the method adopted by the          Committee to secure a close examination of tho availability          of every eligible man of military age.   By means of a Sub-          committee (the Local Arrangements Sub-Committee) which sits          frequently, tho areas into which the country i3 divided,          and the circumstances of each eligible man in those areas.          are closely scrutinised in the light of information already          collected in the Office or furnished for the purpose oi          assisting the scrutiny by the Local Medical War Committee          of the area.   The Sub-Committee decides on this documentary          evidence which men can most probably be epared for service          from the areas in vhich they practise;  and these men aro          then called upon to stato their caso if they so desire,          before the full Committee,                That severity of the scrutiny thus exercised is shown          by the fact that for the period under review, 43&apos;/-- of the %          appeals hoard by tho full-Committee wore allowed, and it          is&quot; certain that     circumstances of various kinds will A          prevent the release of some of the men those appeals were      .    not allowed.                It is to be noted that the figure 48 does not re pro-          sent tho number of men dealt with by the Sub-Committee and          the full Committee in tho interval, or the number of men          actually recommended for commissions, or the difference          between the number recommended for commissions and the
429,  Strand,  W.C./2  4th March,1918       numbor rolinqiilshing commissions, but tho difference between       tho nuuber of men in gonoral practice on August 1st, IS17,  and       January 1st, 1918.   This difference depends not only on tho       action of tho Committee on the one hand^aud the military       authorities on the other, but also on the normal wastage in       the profession due to deaths and retirement,       (b) Trie total number of men of military service age in Sngland       and V/ales not known to bo ineligible for commissions on service       grounds is 2,163.   The categories of v;holo-timo officors and       consultants ere practically exhausted.   Thus there are loft       1,558 general practitioners not known to be ineligible,from       whom the bulk of those who would be required to meet tho fore-       shadowed &quot;demands&quot; would have to be- drawn.   Of these, 1,558       general practitioners about 1,200 have already been found by       the Local Arrangements Srb-Committce, or the Central Medical Yfar       Committee on appeal, to be indispensable.   A considerable  pro-       portion of these are men in colliery and industrial areas where       the presence of  active young men is absolutely essential on       account of tho naturo of the work.   Of the remaining 358,  whose       cases have not yet been completely scrutinised, it is known       that a certain number are r^en whose return has releasod men pre -       viously found indispensable.   Thoy are, therefore, themselves,       for the time being, indispensable.   Some aro men already re-       commended for commissions and not yet posted;  others are men       whose cases aro still subject to appeal.   for these and various       other reasons, it is certain that the large majority of the 358       will eventually be found unavailable for service.      4., The Committee, after consideration of the evidence in itspossession, has come to the folloving conclusions          (i) That a sufficient number of medical men to meet the              requirements foreshadowed for the Uavy, Army and Air              Force, cannot be obtainod from civilian practitioners              under present conditions and with existing powers.          (ii)That at the present time the adoption of legislation              to moat the position is deemed improbable.          (iii)SPhat no reliance can be placed upon a scheme for               voluntary transfer of practitioners to areas other               than those in which they aro now practising,      5. The Committee desires to call the attention of the Ministry efSatLcnalSarrice totharisk to health  and efficiency to which the civilpopulation has already been exposed;  to the hardi&amp;iyg alreadyinflicted on individual members of the medical profession in providingmedical officers for tho Services, and to the intensifiodhardshipwhich must he inflicted on individual practitioners and on the civilcommunity if there is to bo any further reduction of the personnelavailable for civil practice.   The Committee requests the Ministryof Rational Service to urgo on tho proper authority the considerationwhether it tvoH3.d not bo possible to revise the duties of medicalofficers serving with tho forces so as to meet any further rcq ireraentsof the Army without add! tl onal calls on civil practitioners.
