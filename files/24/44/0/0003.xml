     (This document is the property of His Brittanio MaiestyJs Government).iG R El,                          HOUSING.^Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Reconstruction.^ /N-l     i^fiy//    I desire to  make some  observations  on the  ^^w^... - Memoranda which have  been furnished to the War CabinetG.I.Papers  on this  subject by the  President  of the Local Government 3617 3665        Board and by other oolleagues,  and I regret  to say that 3682 3693        I  am  of  opinion that  the  soherae,  as it stands at  present,            will  fail to meet the essential conditions of any successful            housing  scheme.    It               It  will not  be disputed  that  any  housing scheme            to be satisfactory must -                 (1)  result in the building of houses;                 (2)  result in the building of houses  in a sufficient            degree where and when they are  urgently required,  and                 (3)  it  should, in the conditions  attaching to  it,            place a  premium on economic construction and on the fixing            of rents,  as soon as  possible,  to  bring the  scheme  on  to            a  self-supporting basis.                     I regret to  cay  that in my opinion  the scheme as            put forward  by  the  President of the  Local Government Board,            with  the  concurrence  of the Treasury,  fails  to meet these            essential conditions  in an adequate  manner.    2.               The grounds  for  this opinion arc m follows                 (l)  The provision in the emergency period after the            War of any public money to assist housing is  qualified            by the following  conditions in  the Treasury Note            &quot;  (5) Owing  to  the  financial exigencies of the tine                 and the number  of objects for  which money will be                 required by the State, the assistance available                 must,  it  is feared,  be limited in amount as well
        as  in  time and one objeot of  the Government will        naturally &quot;be to secure the erection of as many        houses as practicable where they are most urgently        required.     &quot;   (6)  In communicating their proposals for        financial assistance, their Lordships expressly        ask that it may be made quite clear that the        precise date at which the execution of any schemes        approved by the Board can be commenced must depend        on  circumstances which cannot at present be foreseen        and that the financial position may be such that        it may be necessary to give precedence to the more        urgent oases even to the exclusion for the time        being of the less urgent.&quot;         It is quite clear, especially from paragraph (6)that there is herein no obligation from the Treasury, duringany particular time after the cessation of hostilities, toprovide facilities for housing loans for the erection ofany given number of houses and there is nothing to assurethe Local Authorities that assistance will be given forthe provision of houses stated by the President of theLocal Government Board to be required within any term ofyears whatever.    The whole thing is conditional.    I amthe last to suggest that a blank cheque should be givento Local Authorities, but I am convinced that we have noright to make statements which might arouse hopes whichwould not be fulfilled, or to prepare schemes,  howevernecessary and however much approved by the Local GovernmentBoard,  which will ,not certainly result in the provisionof houses.         (2) The scheme as it stands will, I believe,provide inducement to delay because,  with a possible fallin the prices of building materials during the  years afterthe War, the inducement is to wait  rather than to  takeprompt action.         (3) The wealthier authorities,  to some extent,would possibly be able to raise  loans on their  own credit,but this would certainly not apply  to those where  the
 housing problem is most  aoute  *-  certainly  not  in rural districts,  so  that,  without  a  firm offer of assistance, it  oannot be anticipated that  adequate  and hearty progress will  he made with the preparation of  sohemes.          (4) The  Bill referred to by  Mr. Hayes Fisher does not impose  a duty upon the County Councils to provide houses judged  by the  Local  Government Board  to be neoessary, and there is no adequate machinery for dealing with  inert or recalcitrant authorities.         These  considerations  satisfy me that the scheme as it at present  stands  would  fail to oomply with the two conditions above  recited, viz     the  prompt provision of houses  when and where they are required.         With  respect to the question of urgency, there is a vitally important matter not mentioned in the  scheme either  of the Local Government Board  or of the Treasury, that is to say, the prolongation  or cessation of the Rent and Mortgage-Restriction Act.   So long as it oontinues, which in the nature of the case it could not do for long, it clearly inhibits the development of housing schemes. On the  contrary,  if the Act were  allowed to expire without due houses being  provided, rente would rise to a competitive almost  prohibitive - figure.         Further  on the question  of urgency, the position arising  at the end of the war will, I am convinced,  impel the people to demand that prompt  and  adequate steps are taken to provide houses,  because     (a) there is a serious shortage of houses&quot;already in many  districts, despite the  absence of,  say, four millionmen in  the Army :     (b) there is a great accumulation of arrears, as thePresident shows, owing to the war.   Much additional housing
accommodation  is essential in rural districts, if we areto promote the production of food on successful comprehensivelines.      (c) it is equally necessary with regard to providingfor the capacity of increased production in many of ourindustries.      (d) it is at present a serious cause of unrest and,in the absence of any effective attempt to grapple with it,would, I believe, confront us with formidable dangers.         Personally, I think that the proposals of myHousing Panel, of which lord Salisbury was Chairman, oralternatively, the proposals of the Scottish HousingCommission, are preferable to those of the Local GovernmentBoard and the Treasury.         These respective proposals of the Panel and theCommission are summarised in the appendix and their pointsof similarity are indicated.         But assuming that the Local Government Boardscheme is adopted,  I strongly urge that the followingalterations should be  made for the purpose of -       (a)  ensuring that sufficient houses are built;  and       (b)  preventing delay.The alterations I propose are(l) Paragraphs 5 and 6 in the proposed Local Government    Board circular to  which I have already referred,    should be deleted,  or amended,  as  they are practically    an invitation to inert or recalcitrant authorities    to delay.(2) That,  to quote  the words  of the Scottish Housing    Commission, &quot;the State should explicitly accept    direct  responsibility for the  housing  of the working-    classes,&quot;  and &quot;to  fulfil  this  responsibility there
    should be placed on the Local Authorities a definite    obligation to provide or see that there is provided    a sufficiency of houses.&quot;    The Local Government Board to have power to act in    default.(3) That the  State should definitely undertake to provide    the necessary capital at the lowest rate at which it    can afford to lend.(4) While accepting the  proposal that the Treasury should    bear 75$ of the annual loss and the Local Authority    25$ it should be*made clear that this undertaking only    applies in the case  of schemes formulated and submitted    to the Local Government Board within six months after    the conclusion of the war and commenced within a    definite  period from the time of the Local Government    Board sanctioning the scheme.(5) As regards the valuation and the capitalisation and    loss at the end of a definite period,  I strongly urge    that in BO far as the difference in value  is due to the    decline in the cost  of building, from the  abnormal  inflation    likely to exist immediately after the war,  the whole    of this loss should  be borne by the  State  because    (a)  This  inflation is directly due to war  conditions    (b)  To prevent Local Authorities having an inducement        to delay building so that their  portion of the  loss        when  capitalised should be reduced.        An illustration  will make this clear.    Suppose that    the  housing scheme by a Local Authority costs   100,000    in the immediate post-war period;   suppose  that the cost    of building declines,  as it  is expected to  do,&apos;by say     0$ during the 7 years after the war,  then  at  the end    of that 7 years there will  be a loss  in capital value    of  80,000.    The Local Authority under the  Treasury
    scheme would have to hear  5,000 of this loss.   If the    Local Authority had delayed until the third year after    the war their scheme would only have cost  90,000 and    when valuation took place the loss in capital value    would he only  10,000.    The Local Authority would then    only have to hear  $,500 of the loss.   The Local ,   Authority therefore which delayed would he considerably    better off than the public-spirited authority which    undertook its scheme immediately after the war.(6) In so far as the loss in capital value was not due to    the decline in the cost of building,  I agree that it    should he divided between the Local Authority and the    State as suggested by the Treasury.(7) It is expected that the rate of interest will also    decline and whereas the State may only be able to lend    at 5^fo immediately after the war, at the end of 7 years    it might be able to lend at say 5^.   I suggest  that the    Local Authority should  have power to replace this loan    at the end of that period and get the benefit of the    falling rate of interest, having regard again to    considerations (a) and  (h)  in paragraphs (5) above.(8) finally, I would like to emphasise the necessity for    strengthening the staff of the Local Government  Board    so that it may be s^^*OT^tT5^-e^4^y out as large and                                 A    comprehensive a scheme  as is indicated to he necessary    by the Heturns already  received from Local Authorities    as to the shortage of houses.         I 7/ould like to point out that if the proposals    I have indicated above  were adopted the scheme would    be practically the same as that proposed by the  Scottish    Commission, except that ZSfo of the annual loss would    be borne by the Local Authority and also 25fo of any    loss over and above that due to the fall in the  eost    of building.                             ,        Sgd.

APPEIH      The following are the chief provisions of the scheme of the Majority of the Royal Commission affecting the present discussion^      (a),   The shortage  of houses on the existing standard is 121,000o  To bring the standard of houses up to the minimum of comfort and decency 235,000 houses should be built.   It is proposed that the building of this number should be spread over a period of ten years,,      (b).   That the State should explicitly accept a direct responsibility for the housing of the working classes in Scotland*      (oK   That to fulfil this responsibility there should be placed on Local Authorities a definite obligation to, provide, or see that there is provided, a sufficiency of houses t,      (d)c   That the Local Government Board themselves should have power to carry out the necessary work and recover the cost from the Local Authority on default0      (e).   The Central Authority should be enlarged so as to enable it to deal speedily and effectively with the vast work which will be thrown upon it0      (f)e   The Central Authority should have adequate control of capital expenditure      (g)0  Local Authorities are in many cases too small. Ultimately, for the purposes of the administration of public health, including housing, the establishment of areas/
areas with a population of not less than 50,000inhabitants is desirable.  For the immediate needs ofthe situation the Central Authority should be empowered torequire the combination of existing Local Authoritiesfor these purposes,     (h).  That to enable Local Authorities to fulfil thestatutory obligation above referred to, the Stateshould for a period of seven years subsequent to thewar, make up by way of subsidy the difference betweenthe rentals received by Local Authorities from theirhousing schemes and outgoings for such properties.     (i)o  That at the end of the period of seven years theGovernment should have the houses which have beenerected during that period valued, and should thenpay the Local Authorities the whole capital loss,i0e. the difference between the cost of the housesand the ascertained value.     (j).  That loans at the lowest rate of interest (atwhich State itself can lend without loss) should begranted to Public Authorities to enable them tobuild the necessary houses,     (k).  The Central Authority should exercise effectivesupervision over the rentals to be charged for thehouses.          The proposals  of the Advisory Housing Panel,as  far as they effect the present discussion, are asfollows     (a)  It  is imperative that the Government shouldsecure/
secure within the first year after the war the &quot;building ofefficient houses for the working classes to make up thedeficiency caused by the cessation of building and tosupply some part of the special rural needs.     They estimate on this basis the requirements in 1918to be 300,000 houses in England and Wales and 75,000 addition-al houses  for each year following.     (b).  That the State should provide the whole costof the building and should own the houses for a period to befixed, say, five years, at the end of which pricesmay be expected to have attained a normal level.  Thisperiod is referred to as the transitional period.     (ch  During this period the looal Authoritiesact as agents of the State for building and managingthe houses and collecting the rents.     (d).  At the end of the transitional period theownership of thG houses will be transferred to thelocal authorities at a figure to be fixed by a valuation,based on the cost of building at that time.     The difference between this figure and theoriginal cost will be written off as a free grant fromthe State, and the remainder held a3 a loan upon theusual terms prescribed for such loans and at the rate ofinterest then current.     (e).  During the transitional period, the rents,collected by the Local Authorities as agents, vri.ll bepaid over to the State,  In Urban Districts the aimshould be to fix rents at a figure likely to provide afair interest, sinking fund, etc. when normal conditionsare restored and the abnormal cost has been written off.In/
In rural districts, the rents should &quot;be fconsultation with the Agricultural Wages Board, andin co-operation with that body raised by stages to asimilar figure, which should be reached by the end ofthe transitional period.     (f).  The Government should insist on a high standardof design and lay-out, and, save in exceptional circum-stances, on a restriction of the number of houses builtto the acre to* say, 12 in the towns and to 8 in thecountry.     (g).  The local Authorities which should be employedunder this scheme should be in urban areas the Councilsof the County Boroughs, non-County Boroughs of 10,000population and over and the Urban Districts of20,000 population and over (Part 3, Education Authorities).          In the case of the urban areas below theabove limits, and of the rural areas as a whole, thework will be more efficiently carried out by theemployment of the County Councils.     (h).  If the local Authority fails to carry out thenecessary building, the State will have power itself toundertake the building forthwith, but the Local Authoritywill not thereby avoid the compulsory transfer at theend of the transitional period.     (i).  Unless some effective scheme of decentralisationis adopted, the work of the Central Authority will proveimpossible.  The country should be divided up intoareas/
areas of a suitable size and over each area should beplaced a District Housing Commissioner, who should besubject to the control of the President of theLocal Government Board.          The similarity of the two schemes is striking.Both agree -     (a). Tha^ the State should accept a directresponsibility for the provision of the houses.     (b). That during the transitional period the wholecost should be borne by the State.     (c). That in default of action of the LocalAuthorities, the Central Authority should have power tobuild.     (d). That the areas of existing authorities arein many cases too small.     (e). That the Central Authority should exercise aneffective supervision over rents, construction and lay-out.
