To meet this situation, the Treasury have agreedto a recommendation made by the Committee appointed bythe Cabinet to  consider  questions  of  unemploymentdue  to  restriction of imports, that the Governmentshould, if necessary, subsidise the existing UnemploymentFund administered by the Cotton  Control Board to theextent of about  500,000 up to June 10th next, by whichCGI&amp;ERCB XW INDUSTRY.COTTON.It is anticipated that the further reduction ofdate

In conjunction with the Ministry of Shipping myDepartment have approved the appointment cf mJhe Textilereports Shipping Committee&quot;,  which will consult withthe two Departments as  to  requirements and supply oftonnage for the export  of  textile manufactures,  andwill administer the distribution of the facilitiesavailable.     The Paper Restriction Order, 1918, made  by theBoard on February 27th  limits the amount of wrapping andpacking paper, strawboard, millboard, wood pulp board,cardboard, pasteboard boxes and cartons made of paperor of any of these aaieritfls, which may be supplied byimporters, manufacturers or dealers to their customersdiuring the next 12 months  to two-thirds of the amountsupplied during the year ended 28th February, 1918.  Inthe case cf all other kinds of paper, and of papermaking materials the oorresponding proportion is onehalf.     On February 27th the War Cabinet approved aMemorandum in which I proposed the appointment of  aPaper Controller.   Steps  are now being taken todissolve the Royal Commission on Paper, the members ofwhich will be invited to serve on an  Advisory Committeeunder the Controller.                        (p)
     The Department of Overseas Trade (Development andIntelligence) has been studying specific proposals fordeveloping and strengthening British Trade interestsabroad particularly in Brazil, Spain, Greece andPalestine.     Arrangements are being completed for the despatch toSouth America of a special investigator to examine theconditions and prospects of Sritlsb trade in electroplate,jewellery and cognate goods,     The United States Government have announced that theywill no longer permit the export of any goods from theUnited States whether on Government or private account tothe United Kingdom (cr to the other Allies) unless theexport is recommended by the Import Licensing Authoritieson this side.   The Board of Trade through their Departmentor Import Restrictions, are accepting the responsibility ofrecommending those exports, which they will do by means ofthe issue of permits to the would-bo importers,  which per-mits will be confirmed periodically to the British RarMission in the United States direct.   It has been decidedto issue permits after consultation with a small committeecomposed of representatives of Departments whose interestscompete with private trade interests, and to establish dir-eet communication with the British War Mission with a viewto making them intimately acquainted with the principlesgoverning our action.     The tour of the delegation was brought to a verysuccessful conclusion.  .0ne recult has been the  formationof an unofficial Anglo Serbian Committee  designed tocontinue and extend the relationships formed during thevisit.

Eepresentatives of the two compan-             iesare conferring as to the  allocation of capital in such             an  amalgamation,AX GROWING        A Committee has  he en  appointed ruder the  Chairmanship             of  Lord Colwyn to  consider the  question of Flax-growing             within the Empire.PALIiiN  ZIKC        It has  he en decided that the contract  entered  into byKCENTRA^S             the Board of Trade in 1916 in , respect  of  Australian Zinc             Concentrates shall he replaced by a  new contract which it             is  believed  will be financially  more advantageous  to ELM.             Government whilst  giving them complete  control of  a supply             of  raw  material which before the  War went largely to             Germany;  we  shall  thus be  in a position to supply  our own             and French and Belgian requirements  whilst depriving             Germany,  -except as part  of  a bargain, of an important             material  for her industry.
            PUBLIC  SERVICES  iPIJIIISQJRATIOIT.     My Department have &quot;been  giving  careful  attention  tothe position of the railways  caused  on  the one hand &quot;byincreasing  shortage both &amp;g material and personnel and onthe other by the increasing demands  upon them.     Their  difficulties which have for  a long time beenserious will bo accentrfc&amp;ted fl) by the  necessity of provid-ing conveyance for coal from  South v/ales for Ad:miraltypurposes which in  the past was conveyed by coasting collierto B.E. Ports and  the Forth,  and  (2)  by the  necessity  ofproviding conveyance by rail  to replace the  conveyanceformerly afforded  by colliers which  are to be diverted tocarrying part of the 600,000  tons of coal a  month requiredby Italy.     In view of the present and prospective  food situationI conferred with several members of  the Railway ExecutiveCommittee and asked them to report on the steps necessaryto ensure prompt transport of food if at any time itshould be found necessary,  owing to  a sudden shortage inany particular district,  to distribute  at short noticesuch commodities as may be stored in this country.    As sresult, I am assured that the railways will be able &amp;bany time to cope with such a situation  so long as thereis a prompt clearance by the consignee.    I am incommunication with the Departments concerned with aview to securing that the railways should be prepared inadvance with the necessary information upon which questionsof priority of traffic may bo determined.     In consultation with the Minister of ReconstructionI have appointed a Committee under the  Chairmanship ofLord Wrenbury to enquire what amendments are expedient in
the Companies Acts, particularly having regard  tocircumstances arising  out of  the Wsr  and  of  the  develop-ments likely to arise  on its  conclusion.   One  of  theimportant matters on which  the Committee  will &quot;be askedto report is the  question how far  there should  &quot;be  anylimitation of enemy or alien  interest in,  or control of,British companies and how far such  interest  or  controlshould bo  ipubished.     Under the scheme which has  beon  in force since thebeginning cf tho war, cargo has  been  insured by theGovermae&amp;u?:  at a flat rate, whatever  the  voyage, andwhatever the value.   This system was not  altogethersatisfactory, as the Government  always had to take themore hazardous risks and the  higher values,  and  the flatrate has now been replaced by a  scale  of  rates basedon the ascertained loss ratio in the  different  trades.(The change  came in force today, Thursday, -: rch 7th.)             MISCELLANEOUS.                   COAL CONTROL.     The Coal Mines Control Agreement Confirmation Act1918 received the Royal assent on the 6th February.     LABOUR.-  The war Cabinet has now decided, notwith-stending the pending miners1 national ballot, toproceed at once with the recruitment of 50,000 menfrom the ?nines.     The final scheme for transferring by means ofMobility Bureaux miners from pits in tho exportingdistricts losing much time to pits in districts whichare short handed is now before tho miners for acceptance.
Transference to other work of national importance,such es shipyards, continues to make satisfactoryprogress.     Several applications for the 12-J per cent increasemade on behalf of various employees in or about coal mineshave been resisted in accordance with the general policyof keeping the 12-1&quot; per cent out of the mines.     DISTRIBUT101.  Arrangements have been made to railabout 30,000 tons of coal weekly from Durham to the South,about 20,000 being for the gas works in the interior, and10,000 for shipment ct Hull.   Besides reducing uneuiploy-ment at gas coal collieries in Durham this will relievethe pressure on supplies in the Midlands and also assistin meeting shipping difficulties both on the Eumber andthe Thames.     legotiations are proceeding with the public utilityundertakings and other consumers using sea-borne coal asto the diversion of tonnage from the coastwise trade toassist in the increase in the su-pply of coal to Italy, whichhas been decided on by the War Cabinet.                  TIMBER CONTROL.     H0M5 GROWN PRODUCTION^  Every effort is being made toencourage and assist the Home Timber -rade to maintain andincrease its production, and success is being attained inthis direction in spite, of the many and varied difficultiesregarding: labour, machinery etc. which are being experiene-ed.8   The Department itself is also exploiting home gownwoods and these operations are continuously being extended.The Pitwood position is fairly satisfactory and there isno prospect of any immediate shortage.
     riPOETATIOH OF IvORTlTG-N WOODS.    Special  * arrangements  have  been made for co-ordinating  the purchase  of timber in the U.S.  and  a representative of  the Timber Supply Department, with Headquartere at  Washington is arranging such purchases through the Trade War Mission.    SUPPLY 0?  TIMBER FOB WiR RWJISffENTS ETC.  This Department is  responsible for the supply of  timber to Government Departments notably  the  Admiraltvs  the War Office, Air Council, the  Ministry of Munitions and the Offico of -forks,  &apos;  Special steps are being taken to  obtain the ash necessary to meet  the large  demands  of the Air Board and considerable progress has been  made  in this direction.                       TOBACCO  CONTROL.    The stock of Tobacco in the  countrv in Bend at the end of February was estimated at 53,500 tens.  The imports of Tobacco during the first  two months of the year amounted  to only 3,500  tons,   -/he position there- fore has been  causing the Department much anxiety.   The average consumption per month is estimated at practically 7,000 tons, and owing to  it  taking  the best  part  of sixmonths for Tobacco to reach  the consumer from theproducer an amount which  is equivalent to  six months&apos; stock in hand  is considered  to be the absolute minimumwhile the&quot;consumntion is allowed to  remain at tho present   The policy of the Department  is to  restrict  thecivil consumption of petrol within the narrowest
 limits by confining- its use as far as possible to necessary purposes.   The quantity licensed for purchase:- during February was about 6-g- million gallons as compared  with 10 million gallons  before 1917.   2,000 permits have been issued for  tile  use of  Gas instead  of petrol in the propulsion&quot;of  vehicles, thus reducing further the consumption- of petrol by 10,000 gallons  per month.                  - ROAD TRANSPORT.    The first meeting of tho Road Transport Board was held on the 28th February.    The Board, of which Sir Bvan Jones is chairman, consists of a representative of the Ministry of Munitions,  the  Ministry of Food,  the War Office, tho Post Office,  the Ministry  of Reconstruction  and the Rorse  Transport Department  of the Board of Trade, while  arrangements have been made  for other Government Departments  concerned  to keep in  touch with  it.    The  decisions  of  the Board will  be .carried  into effect by  Divisional Boards  (  in  each  of the  Food -Commissioners Areas)  and sub-Committees,  the  appointment of which is now under consideration.  All existing local Committees dealing with read transport  questions will be represented on  the  new organisation, but  there will be only one road transport authority  in  any  one area.    In  the above SuiBar&quot;  I have dealt only with thomain matters likely to be of  interest  to my colleagues, and have net referrcf to a number of miscellaneous                     (S)
questions and important work of a more or lesscurrent character on which my Department has beenenraged.  Among these may he mentioned the waterpower scheme of the British Aluminium Company;a proposal for largo additions to Blectrical plantin the Birmingham Area; the question of facilitiesfor overland trade with Italy via a train-ferry; thepreparation by tho Statistics Department of variousspecial compilations, and regular returns of shinning,coal output, Bondon coal supplies, stocks of oil-seedsand oils (other than mineral oils) glycerine productionand cotton imports which are furnished to other Bo-partments of the O-overnment, or are published at monthlyor more frequent intervals; and the administrationof tho provisions of the Trading with the Bnemy Acts,which throw duties on the Board of Trade.
