vir-culat6d.t^ ghe.&amp;in&amp; and-Wax Cabinets;.-BY: LaD    CJICII,:DUTCH SKIPPINGThe situation appears to he as follows:-vve have urgent need of more shipping both for thesupply of coal to Italy and the supply of cereals tothe Allies in general;  The Dutch have some 6 to 7QQPOOtons of shipping lying idle in Allied ports, of which400,000 tons are in United States ports;  */e are innegotiation with the Dutch Government to obtain anagreement by which, among other thingswe shall&apos; ootainthe use of the Dutch shipping now in Allied ports, pro-vided it is not sent- into the danger zone.  Pending theconclusion of this agreement we. have made a modusVivendi cy which the Dutch tonnage in United States portsmay he used temporarily for Allied purposes.  It is anOssential part of this modus Vivendi that 150,000 tons ofDutch shipping may be used for the Belgian Relief pui^-poses upon the terms that for every ship that sails forRotteindam with cargo for Belgium a similar ship will hesent simultaneously from a Dutch port to the UnitedStates.  The Dutch have given us notice that they areunable to fulfil this last provision because theGermans will not allow any of their ships to sail fromHolland.-  The American Government have thereuponsuggested for consideration that they should forthwithrequisition all the Dutch tonnage in their portst  Weare ad-vised that such action would be strongly resentedin Holland;!and might, result in the breaking off ofcomi$$v-ciali..-,r e lations at any rate, and perhaps more.
We are dependent on Holland for margarine, flaxseed,and for Borneo oil which is important in the rcanu-facture of toltPQfc,  If we lose these Dutch products weshould suffer v.ery grave inconvenience or worse.  Onthe other hand it seems extremely unlikely that theDutch would involve themselves in a permanent commercialquarrel not only with us hut with our Allies and&apos;America.Speaking for myself I do not believe that they wouldtake any such action.  One way out of the difficultywhich has been suggested is that we should continue themodus Vivendi, waiving the- clause as to Belgian Heliefvessels which could perhaps be arranged otherwise, thatwe should -say to the Dutch, if you will si^h the Americanagreement by the middle of April, we will undertake tolet you have in United States ports 100,000 tons ofcereals which it seems we could do. and if you do notsign the Agreement by then, we shall requisition allyour tonnage.  The disadvantage of this, course is thatwe do not get the tonnage now when-it is most necessaryand that it is at any rate doubtful whether we shouldhave control of as much Dutch tonnage in the middle ofApril as we have now.  Another course would be to tellthe Dutch quite frankly that we must have the tonnage,that it is evident from their failure to withstandGeiTnan pressure over. the modus Vivendi that we havevery little hope of securing the tonnage by agreement.At the same time we nrefer to proceed by agreement ifpossible provided it does not involve any further greatloss of timec.  If therefore they are orepared to signthe agreement forthwith, so far as it affects tonnage,we would undertake to let them have 100,000 tons ofcereals as soon as they can send shippinrr to fetch it,.                                                But
But we must have the answer immediately,   The firstmeeting of the Allied Maritime Council is to takeplace next Monday and the Allies will then have todetermine what their policy on this kind  of mattersis going to be.  If no agreement has been come to by-then there is very little doubt that the  Allies willdecide to requisition the whole of the Dutch tonnagewhich, from a purely shipping point of view, is pre-ferable to obtaining it by agreement, since by theagreement its use is to some extent fettered.  On thewhole this last course seems to me the best in thecircumstances.Foreign Office.      March 4th,1918.

I  need not  enlarge  to you upon the gravity ofthe situation; &quot; we  have had to sacrifice every pilingin :;larch to bring  foodstuffs for ourselves and ourAllies  and  we may  have to continue this policy duringthe spring.  I do  not like to think of the effectwhich this  is going to have on the nitrate and otheressential rmmition supplies later in the year.      It is  impossible to exaggerate the importanceof securing for  the Allies 400,0(30 tons of promptocean-going ton lag e available for bringing supplies toEurope.  It would  tide u3 over the critical months ofthis  year in so  far as the food situation is concerned,and it  would make  infinitely easier the task of                                           dealing.  Lord Robert Cecil,  A.C ,,/hP.,Foreign Office,
dealing with the  Italian coal situation. 

There is no comparison between the value to us of tonnage which can be brought into the war zone and tonnage which is subject to the restrictions on trading stipulated in the draft Dutch agreement. Even if this agreement were signed in the course of the next month or so the ships could not be employed so as to bring any relief to the European situation before the late summer.

The facts set out in Lord Reading&apos;s telegram demonstrate that Holland is not in a position to enter into any agreement with us of which Germany does not approve and Germany is never likely to give her assent to an agreement which gives us material help. There is every probability therefore that we shall have to face sooner or later the political consequences of requisitioning and if that is the case then the sooner we make up our minds to do it the better

 4  million tons of United Kingdom imports  and this  cut, has been allowed for in the  documents  we  have been discussing with the allies.-  The Curson Committee  at subsequent meetings have indicated  that a further 2  million tons cut would be  possible with very serious results., but  beyond that have  not felt it possible even to  surest any further  reduction.      This leaves us therefore  with  a very hard deficit of at-least 6 million tons  of  imports  on  the ; assumption that France  and  Italy could live  in spite of &quot;Riminished stoeis  during  1918 on the amount  of imports-of 1917 except  for the increase in cereals0 Their stated  requirements, however, largely  exceed their 1917.imports,  the- Increase  In the case of France being over 2  million  tons in addition  to  the cereal increase.&quot;  This deficit  may  be taken as representing&apos; the  continuous  employment&apos;of something  over li million tons:d;w.&quot;&apos;of  shipping.   Towards  this we have nothing exeeet any additional help we can obtain&apos;fromAmerica,:from further neutral vessels&apos;or  from internedvesselsv      with regard to .  /erica, it  Is  evident that further help-will  be extremely difficult to obtain,causing as  it necessarily will a limitation of theAmerican military  effort,  at the samo  time it willbo essential  that we shall gst substantial  help fromthem  even at  this  cost,  1     For  the  rest,  there are  in effect only the .;wedisn                                        and
and Dutch vessels with remote possibilities ofinterned vessels on which we cannot rely.  The Dutchtonnage is of course an immense factor and woulditself, having regard to its position etc0 probably moosomething like l/3rd of the outstanding deficit ifaction is taken at once and the ships immediately gothold of.
