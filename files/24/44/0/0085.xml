       -i?l?J^ocument is the Propertv(/oT       Jjis Britannic Majesty^ Government)RE STRICT I OF:- OH USE OF GAS &amp; ELECTRIC LIGHTBoard of Trade Memorandum;257/In accordance with the decision arrived at by the  WarCabinet on Wednesday 27th February,  coasting steamers normallybringing coal to London and the South of England are being with-drawn from the service for the purpose of conveying coed forItaly either by direct sea route or through the Biscay ports,with the result that a severe restriction on the use of coalhas become inevitable immediately.      The transference of the conveyance of this coal from thesea route to the rail route from the North-East Coast ismainly governed by the amount of additional rail-bcrne coalthat the London public utility companies are able to handle,and from the information at the disposal cf the Department at  themoment this doe3 not exceed l  million tons.   The conveyance  cfoven this quantity by rail will involve considerable furtherrestrictions in public facilities.   Normally the summer is used  bypublic utility companies to build up their stocks to provida for  theincreased use cf coal during the winter months; and, if disaster  isto be avoided next winter, this practice must bs continued.      At tho present time the stocks in London generallyspeaking are rather under five weeks&apos; supply, though thebiggest consumer (the Gas Light 2c Coke Company) has leasthan three weeks&apos; supply.   With a possible reduction in thecoal that can be brought into London for these undertakingsof over 1,000,000 tons (although daylight saving will providea relatively unimportant saving) nothing short of a drasticreduction in the amount  of gas and electricity used for lightingand power will avcid a very serious position arisipg next winter.It is therefore thought  necessary that, as an. immediate step,an Order should be  issued prohibiting shop-window lightingthroughout the country.   It is further proposed  that  either
258in the same Order or in another Order provision shouldhe made that no meals are to he served in the  publicrooms of any restaurant, hotel or club after 9.30  p.m.     It is further suggested that careful considerationshould be given to the question of a limited supply oflight or power to all places of amusement, and thatdomestic supply should be severely curtailed.    Thereare two methods of effecting the latter purpose,  viz:Fixing a standard supply for the consumer over a periodof time, and if he is found to be in excess of the fixedamount cutting his supply off entirely until the surplushas been worked off.   The enforcement of such a measurewould be attended with great inconvenience to  the con-sumer, and may be considered unnecessarily narsh,  and abetter means of securing the desired end would seem tobe an appreciable increase in the charge by way of a.penalty on all amounts consumed in excess of the standard.This method has been adopted abroad, where amounts con-sumed in excess of, say, 60 per cent, of the normal con-sumption are charged for at rates varying from double tofive times the normal rate.     The use of gas aa a motive power for vehicles mayalso have to be further restricted.   In the&apos;case  ofsome areas where the supply of gas for munition worksis insufficient orders have already been made  prohibit-ing ita use for traction, and similar orders may haveto&apos;be made elsewhere, whilst the issue of permits  foradditional gasdriven vehicles might be suspended.     The effect of the reduced quantity of coal car-bonised will be a serious one in so far as by-productsused for munition purposes are concerned,  and  it ha3                                            been
                                                         259  been suggested that the difficulty might  be met by  further drastic reductions in consumption of domestic  fuel.   But in regard to this, as  mentioned before  in  this memorandum, the position is governed mainly by  the amount of coal that the undertakings  can deal with  which reaches them by railway, so  that  any reduction,  however large, in the amount of coal  for  domestic  purposes cannot entirely meet the  needs of the  situa-  tion.       It is however proposed that a further severe cut  shall be made in the coal rations  permitted in  the  Metropolitan Police area, and it is also  proposed to  impose these rations on all parts  of the  country  south  of Westmoreland and Durham, excluding South Wales.
