(This Document is the P^dperty ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)ftSECRET..Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BPW/026.Weekly Report on Poland.  XXVI.     (6th March, 1918.)     1.    In conversation with a member of our  bureau, M. Kamenev,one of the Bolshevik members during the first negotiations  atBrest-Litovsk,  stated that the frontier between Poland and  Lithuaniaas planned by the Germans was to run from Suvalki ^y Grodno in  apractically straight line towards Slonim and the Ukrainian  frontier,the town of Grodno being included in Lithuania.   Thus the  forecastin our Report of October 25, 1917, that &quot;the White Russians will bethrown to the wolves, i.e. to the Polish and Lithuanian  Imperialists&quot;has proved exact; the occupied parts of White Russia are to bepartitioned between Lithuania and Poland.   The Germans  openlyadmitted that the separation of White Russian districts  from thegreater part  f. TPMte Russia which remains with Russia,  could be &apos;justified on racial grounds; their aims were obviously  strategic.A frontier attributing to Lithuania only Lithuanian districts andto Poland that only which is due to her on national grounds,  woujdleave to Russia the two important parallel strategical railwaylines which run from Dvinsk by Vilna to Grodno, and from Polotskby Lida, Volkovisk towards Siedlets.   It will  further be markedthat the Germans thus propose to establish a frontier betweenLithuania and the Ukraine - this explains why they have  includedsome White Russian districts round Brest-Litovsk in the  latter.As Germany means to keep Lithuania under strict tutelage, she willestablish direct contact with the Ukraine and encircle both Polandand Austria-Hungary.
     2.    Count Kertling in his speech on February 25th statedthat ^in the regulation of&quot;the-dTr-on-tiBT. question only what is in-dispensable on military grounds will be demanded on Germany-1^part&quot;.However skilfully placed in a mislAauiing -o-onneci;ijon-, this sentenceclearly points towards &quot;frontier rectifications&quot; for-Prussia atthe expense of Poland, an-i confirms the rumours to that effect whichhad been current for a long time.   It is certain that the Germansintend to retain for themselves the Bobr-Narev line v/ith thefortresses of Ossoviets and Lomzha.   How far to the West theypropose their frontier to extend along the Harev is &quot;not knoYm,but the rumour that this is to be down to its very junction withthe Vistula hardly deserves credence.   It would mean that the newGenpan frontier would approach to within 15-20 miles of Warsaw.rtf is further rumoured that the Germans propose to annex themining districts of Tcheritochova, Dombrova and  Qlkush.   Thishowever would mean such a blow to Poland&apos;s economic future that noPolish statesman could ever agree to such conditions.     3.   The excitement over the cession of Cholm to the Ukrainehas been  oaly slightly diminished by the promise of a readjustmentof the frontier in accordance with nationality.   After all,  it isnot a just frontier based  on nationality which  the Polish bourgeoisparties desire, but annexations at the expense  of their neighbours.Of these  there  is nov/  little chance except for  a small share  inV/hite Russia.   The danger  of German encroachments  in the West,the general unsettlement caused by recent events, and lastly  thefeeling  of Ibland^ absolute impotence renders the political atmos-phere in  Poland extremely  tense.   Pro-Austrian feeling hasreceived  a  deadly blow even in Galicia,  anti-German passion isrunning higher  than ever.   It is amazing to read the things  whichappear nowadays even-in the tamest Cracow papers,  it is stillmore amazing  that they should  ever have passed  the Galician censor-
     4*   The cession of Cholm served incidentally to the irinumer-able Polish, politicians and parties as an opportunity for hayinga day of general readjustment, atonement and forgiveness.   Henwho had previously discredited themselves &quot;by excessive subservienceto the Central Powers tried to clear themselves by Joining in thegeneral din of indignation.   On the other hand, a deputation fromthe tnter^aparty Union, whioh in the past accused all adherents ofa Polish Gov-ernmerrt in ^garsaw of being pro-Germans, or at leastpro-Austrians, declared to the Regency Council that &quot;the RegencyCouncil as the symbol of sovereign power ought to remain at itspost&quot;.   (The parties of the Left demand the resignation of theRegency Council and a complete break with the Central lowers.)     5.   As was to be,expected, the Polish, army in Russia hasjoined hands with, the Germans.   The German official report ofMarch 3rd, which reviews recent operations against Russia, statesthat &quot;at Bobruisk a junction withAPoiish divisions waB effected&quot;.These are obviously the two divisions under General jyowbor^lkisnickiwhich operated in that region.  The capture of Minsk nin concertwith the Germans&quot; is the last recorded exploit of the Polish army.Also on the Ukrainian front the- Polish regiment a- hare joined theGermans.6.2.18.
