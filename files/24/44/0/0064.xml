ball GVMINISTEY    OP    FOOD.Report  for Week  ending Wednesday,  March  6, 1918.                         PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN.     Allied Requirements - A cable has been received from Mr. Hoover stating that asa result of a freer transportation movement with better weather, and  of the conserva-tion campaign, there will be 450,000 tons of  pork products available for shipment tothe Allies in March and April, as well as a materially increased supply of meat.     Mr. Hoover points out that it is impossible&quot; for the United States to allow thisglut to break the prices to lower levels than&quot; at  present on the ground that it  woulddiscourage  farmers and demoralise  the  whole  of  next  year&apos;s production.   He isreluctant to remove all the restrictions on the  consumption of meat  and pork, whichwould in turn demoralise the food conservation  movement, and result in decreasedexports to the Allies  at a later date.  He  therefore suggests that the Allies shouldundertake a blanket order  for all excess production of pork products until the end ofApril, and either to ship them to the Allied countries for storage or arrange for theirstorage in America.     Mr. Hoover adds that they are entirely short  of  breadstuffs in the United States,and that they cannot go on  exporting  at the  present rate per month, and that theAllies by materially increased  consumption of pork could reduce  the demand forbread stuffs, butter and cheese.     If the American beef  industry is to be  maintained, Mr. Hoover  states it will benecessary for the Allies to  take beef products of a higher class at somewhat higherprices than at present, otherwise  conservation  of meat in America  will have to beabandoned.     Important cables have been received from Lord Reading at Washington, in whichhe states that Mr. Hoover  informed him that  the Allies may have to do without anywheat for April shipment from North America.  In- view of the  seriousness  of thisposition, Lord Reading asked  for  the latest  figures  of our reserves of cereals, whichare being forwarded to him by the Wheat Executive.     Mr. Hoover has already temporarily done  away with  the porkless Saturday anddaily meatless meal.   Dealing with this in a further telegram, Mr. Hoover states :            &quot;  Nothing I regret  more than the  necessity to allow any increase in con-      sumption in  these times, but I could see no other solution.   We can supply      any amount that the Allies  will agree to  take of meat products during the next      two months, after that  the seasonal slump  in  market arrivals of animals will      make the  situation  most  difficult to  maintain unlimited supplies although we      are prepared to go to any measure to try and fill their requirements.&quot;     Cablegrams have been sent by Lord Rhondda and tLe Wheat Executive to LordReading, urging the vital necessity of continued wheat exports from North Americain order to maintain the minim am of reserve necessary to safety.     An inquiry through the Secretary of State  for the Colonies has been addressed tothe Governor-General of Australia as to whether the Commonwealth would be preparedto accept a proposal for the  purchase of the 1917-18 wheat crop,, which,  however,could not be based upon the ordinary considerations of commercial&apos; transactions.     In answer to a cablegram from Mr. Hoover asking for his views as to the totalcessation of brewing on both sides  of the Atlantic, Lord Rhondda has  sent thefollowing cablegram :            &quot; Referring to  your cablegram received February fith, I have issued an      Order  to  take effect March 1st, requisitioning all home-grown  or  imported      barley, thus preventing at any rate for the present further  use of any barley     A (33)6259-1  Pkl  115 3/18  E&amp;S                                           A
      for malting purposes.  By another Order, also to ,take  effect March 1st, I have      prohibited the manufacture, sale, purchase, delivery, or use  of  any .malt or      malt extract, except under licence, the term malting to include the steeping,      roasting,  or treatment of any  cereal.  The latter Order permits the brewing      for existing contracts of the maximum barrelage allowed under the restrictions      previously imposed, which reduced the output of beer  in the United Kingdom      to fifteen thirty-sixths of the pre-war output, besides decreasing its strength to      a considerable extent.  The practicability of further restrictions is  still under      discussion by the War Cabinet, but I feel sure  you  will  appreciate the      difficulties and dangers of  imposing  upon the working classes any sweeping-      measure  of  prohibition especially  at a moment when drastic compulsory      rations are coming into force.&quot;    Consumers1  Council. Mr. Clynes presided at the weekly meeting of this Councilon 6th March.  Lord Rhondda was present at a discussion on the subject of tea prices.Mr. Beveridge gave an outline of the  national meat  rationing scheme and explainedthat it was  intended  to give a supplementary meat ration to all industrial workers inthe first instance, to  be followed, if supplies  allowed, by a further supplement to thoseengaged  in specially heavy work.  A resolution was passed approving these proposals.Mr. Buckley addressed the Council on milk supplies.  On the proposal of Sir WilliamAshley,   resolutions  were carried in  favour of increased  attention  being given tosupplies  and  preparation of vegetables, and  it was arranged  that this question shouldbe referred to the appropriate branch of the  new Food Survey Board.    Diminution of queues. The hope expressed in Lord Rhondda&apos;s message to themen at the front that under the new rationing arrangements queues  would disappearhas in considerable measure been realised  so far as the  London and Home Countiesscheme   is  concerned.  A  comparative return of the estimated number of personsattending food queues in the  Metropolitan Police area during&apos; the week preceding thescheme  and the first week in which  the scheme was in  working shows the  followingtotals :  -	Monday.	Tuesday.	Wednesday.	1 Thursday, j Friday.		Saturday.18th to 23rd February 25th February to 2nd March	46,316 700	143,933 1,200	131,809 4,330	157,223 6,900	317,158 67,335	542,953 110,565    Such queues as there were collected mainly at the week-end for meat, and insome cases for bacon, owing to a mistaken notice in some newspapers.  There waslittle apparent  shortage  in supplies of margarine, and complaints regarding  meatwere not so much of actual shortage as of the lateness of the supply.    It is hoped that the ascertainment  of these facts, and the  publication of thesefigures will go far to counteract the  depressing effect on our soldiers of complaintsfrom home about the food situation.   Arrangements  have been made, in conjunctionwith the War Office and the Y.M.C.A., to send speakers over to the front, and to  issuespecial  leaflets.  The speakers who  have  gone were carefully instructed beforehandas to the actual situation, and  reports from France show that this propaganda work,which will not be allowed to slide, has been instantly successful.     Food Survey Board, The  Food  Controller has decided that the functions hithertoexercised by the Food  Economy Division (in  so far  as they do  not fall within thefunctions of  any existing division) shall in future  be re-allocated to  a  Board to  beknown as the &quot; Food Survey Board,&quot; under the chairmanship of  Lieut.-Col. Weigall,M.P., and representative of the following branches       (1)  Food Survey (Public Services) Branch under the charge of Lieut-Col. Weigall           and  Major G. Henderson,  dealing with the consumption of food in the           Army  and Navy, as well as by prisoners of war, official or semi-official           canteens serving soldiers and  sailors, prisons, Poor Law institutions, and           the like.     (2)  Food  Survey (Civilian) Branch   dealing with  hotels,  clubs,  restaurants,           munition canteens, hostels, and  eating-houses other than those dealt with           under  (1).   This  branch will also be  responsible for  the  issue and           distribution of all sumptuary orders.
    (3) National Kitchens Branch dealing with the organisation of national kitchens,           other than,  canteens, hotels,  or  other  catering  establishments.    The           National Kitchens Order, 19.18, dated the 25th February, 1918, provides           for the establishment and maintenance of  National Kitchens by the Local           Authorities.    (4) Educational Branch,  under the charge  of Professor E. H. Starling, F.R.S.,           dealing with the teaching of cooking and domestic  economy.   This branch           will also be responsible for the issue by the Ministry of all advice relating           to the economical consumption of food and the use of substitutes.    Joint Orders Committee. The  Committee have had  under discussion the policyto be adopted with-regard to the 1918  crops  of cereals and roots; it was decided torecommend the  cultivation of grain and potatoes rather than roots, that those whohave one acre or less  under cereals should  be allowed to feed the  produce (exceptwheat) to their pigs and poultry without any  restriction, and that holders  of  10 acresor less in Ireland  should  be granted  a similar concession,   ft was also decided thatdifferent prices to the producer should  be fixed for cheese that would keep until dis-tributed next winter and cheese that required to  be put into immediate consumption,such cheese being bought by the Government factor and  sold at the Government flatrate ;  all cheese  of an inferior quality would  be considered as  &quot; damaged cheese,&quot; andwould be sold with all  faults direct to  a retailer  at a  lower price than that given forsound cheese.    Local  Administration. Applications  continue to be received for  sanction forincreases in the  membership of &quot;committees, and in 28 cases during the  past  weekapproval has been given, the object being to secure additional representation of labour,and also in some cases of women, and of the co-operative movement.    Ships&apos; Stores. Under the Ships1 Stores Restriction  Order it is compulsory forships to render to the  Ministry of Food Inspectors  at the ports a manifest declaringtheir surplus stores on board on arrival, and  their requirements for  the forthcomingvoyage.  The first two  months&apos; returns  from  18 ports show  that approximately2,500 tons  of essential foodstuffs were prevented from  leaving the country as surplusstores.    A scheme has been inaugurated to encourage shipowners and those responsiblefor storing ships to fill ail their spare store room  and  cabin room  space with essentialfoodstuffs upon their return to Britain.  These surplus foodstuffs are landed at thefirst port of call, and placed in a Provision Pool for the express purpose of ships thatmay require foodstuffs hereafter.  These Pools are managed  by Committees of Ship-owners and Ships&apos; Store Merchants, and  are in constant  touch  with the Ships&apos; StoreSection at the Ministry of Food.  Upwards of 3,000 tons of  meat,  flour,  sugar, tea,coffee, bacon, butter,  &amp;c, have already been brought in and  placed  in the Pools, andin some cases the Pools have released foodstuffs for the civil population.                               SUPPLIES AND PRICES.     Bacon. Adequate supplies  were  forthcoming  for the  rationing  scheme  inoperation in London  and  the Home  Counties, and no serious complaints have  beenreceived from  within that area.   Some  districts  outside,  however, suffered from  atemporary stoppage of supplies which, it is anticipated, will be remedied next week.     Batter. -A distribution of butter is being made this week to the amount of one-eighth of the applications received for the month of March.     The total  quantity of butter  on the water is now  17,688  tons ; 115 tons  havebeen received from the United States of America this week, and 157 tons  from theArgentine.     Cheese.-The  total amount of New Zealand cheese available is 54,000 tons, of which  25,552   tons is awaiting  shipment.   The  quantity  available for March is 5,705  tons,  for  April 5,143 tons, for  May 8,714 tons, and  for  June  1,714  tons. Arrangements  have bee]]  made for the  shipment  of  1,000  tons of ^ cheese  from Australia in March, but no advice of  actual  shipments has yet been received.  43 tons of  Dutch cheese have arrived, but no information has been received as to there beingany further quantity available.
    Dried  Fruits. It  has been  decided to  revoke the Dried Fruits  (Restriction)Order, and  to  adopt  a new policy with  regard to dried fruits.   The  AdvisoryCommittee have been summoned to consider the new situation.    Fish. The Freshwater  Fish  (Ireland) Order,  1917,  Amendment Order, 1918,dated the 26th February, 1918, deletes the words &quot; or pollen &quot; from the  definition offreshwater fish in Clause 3 of the principal Order.    Meat. The Meat (Retail Prices) Order has been issued, prescribing  one scale ofmaximum retail prices for London and  the Home  Counties and another scale for therest of England.   The  issue of these uniform scales has been rendered necessary bythe advent of rationing schemes, since it would be inadvisable to have different valuesfor the meat coupons in different areas covered by the same rationing scheme.  A newschedule of maximum wholesale meat prices has  been issued as an amendment to theMeat (Maximum Prices) Order, corresponding  to  the new retail schedules mentionedabove.  The wholesale price of imported  meat will  be  the same  as  for home-killedmeat; arrangements have been made with the importers to collect for the Ministry ofFood  the difference between the importers&apos; price  and the wholesale  price, less 2 percent, commission.    The London Central Markets Order has been issued, prohibiting the retail sale ofmeat  in the wholesale portion of Smithfield Market, and giving power to  the FoodController to make  directions as to the opening and closing of the market and as tothe sale and distribution of meat in the market.   The rationing  scheme for Londonand the Home Counties has rendered it necessary that  the Ministry  of Food shouldhave effective control of Smithfield Market.    The London and Home  Counties rationing scheme is proving more successfulthan could reasonably have been expected, though the experience of the last week hasdisclosed certain defects in distribution, which are being remedied.  The experiencegained in this way will be most valuable when, the scheme is extended to the rest ofGreat Britain, the date for which has now been postponed till April 7th.    The home  slaughtering figures are  now very close to the estimate  on which therationing scheme was  based,  and the  latest  reports from the United States wouldappear  to indicate that all the frozen meat  likely  to  be required  for making  updeficiencies will be available from  that,  source.   This,  however, depends  upon theprovision of the. necessary refrigerated tonnage, a most urgent problem.    Great pressure, has been brought to bear for the increase of the ration in the caseof certain classes of industrial workers.   The question of how far this demand can bemet cannot be settled before the introduction  of the  general rationing scheme.  It issatisfactory to note that there is a decided tendency for voluntary rationing schemesto be  adopted in provincial centres.   This recognition of the value of the principle ismost  desirable.    Miscellaneous  Foodstuffs. An  Order fixing the maximum  price  of desiccatedcocoanut at 41. 10-s. per  cwt., and  the  maximum  retail  price at Is. per  lb. fromMarch 4th and  March 11th respectively, was issued on March 2nd.    Oilseeds. The purchase of premier  jus  in  South America  is proceeding satis-factorily; arrangements have been made  for  freight room for linseed, but owing tothe difficulty of making financial arrangements it  now proves impossible to purchasefor prompt  delivery.   Every  endeavour  is being made to bring forward as largesupplies of whale-oil as possible.    Tea. A general meeting of the  wholesale tea trade held to consider the Govern-ment Distribution Scheme  decided by a large majority to accept it.    Full instructions have been given  to the Government agents in China as to theproportions  and qualities of tea to be purchased in that country.                          DISTRIBUTION AND ENFORCEMENT.    Distribution. There has again  been  a decrease  in the complaints of shortage^ ofsupplies, in the past week, and those received  have  been chiefly from districts whichhave  not adopted Local Rationing Schemes.    Complaints from the urban districts are more insistent  than  those for  the ruralareas, but the difficulties  of obtaining  supplies in country districts are considerable.It is stated, for instance, that in some Midland villages supplies of meat  are entirelycut off,  owing to lack of facilities for distribution..... .    The question  of provision of additional supplies for Easter,  Whitsuntide, and inthe summer months has been-raised,, and reports on the subject have been called for.
     Rumours that men in sedentary occupations in the army are shortly to be put  on:army rations, in place of making their  own arrangements in billets as heretofore, arestated to  be causing some  uneasiness amongst munition  workers,  and miners  inLancashire, who regard the proposal as unfair.     Enforcement--The number of prosecutions in  London, Scotland, Ireland, andWales for  the  week ending the 23rd  February is 1,135, of which 1,107  resulted  inconvictions.  Of these, 530 were in Ireland-from which returns have not hithertobeen received.  Out of the 530,458  were successful.  The average penalty inflicted was11. 5s. Ad.  in Ireland, and 51. 13s. Ad. elsewhere.  135 prosecutions related to butter,114 to flour and bread, 86 to milk,  and  75 to bacon, ham and lard.   Four cases underthe Food Hoarding Order may be noted :            At  North London Police Court,  L.  Danni,  furrier, was  fined  50Z. and       5 guineas costs- for having in his possession 56 lbs. margarine.   The household       consisted of three adults and two young children.           At  Cardiff, Chong Ding Chu,  boarding-house keeper, was fined  100Z. for       having 22 cwts. of rice in his possession.           At  Chipping  Norton Police Court, Mrs. Ellen  Hinds  was convicted and       lined 50Z. and 101. costs for hoarding 112 lbs. of  tea.   The  tea  was ordered to       be  confiscated.  The point was raised that tea was not food.           At Wellingborough, G.  F. Williamson, iron founder, Wellingborough, was       fined 40Z. and costs for hoarding 25 lbs. of ham, 62 lbs. sugar, 12 lbs. Quaker       oats, 10 lbs. tea, 13J lbs. tapioca, 56 lbs. flour, 14^- lbs. biscuits.     At Uxbridge  Petty Sessions,  S. J. Price  was sentenced to 2  months  hard labouron each of two counts  relating to the  Milk Amendment Order, the sentences  torun concurrently,.    &quot;At Tower Bridge  Police Court, Joseph Thomas Healey, dealer in poultryfood, trading  as Messrs. J. T. Healey  &amp; Co., Borough Granaries, Great  Maze Pond,Southwark, was  fined  2801. on  56 summonses  for  buying wheat  and barley  sodamaged as to be unfit for milling at  a price exceeding the maximum fixed by theGrain (Prices) Order, 1917.                                  &apos;PART II.-SUMMARY  OF  THE  FOOD POSITION.

Flour fell off 7,000 tons, and barley 5,600 tons, but maize increasedby 18,000 tons.    Large consignments of beef and of mutton were received last week.   The averageimports of all meat and lard  during  the  five weeks January 27th to March 2nd, were23,500 tons ;  this is slightly above the average for the whole of the pre-war year 1913.If last week&apos;s rate of imports could be maintained for 6 months, the requirements formeat estimated as necessary to reach the standard of 1916 would just be met.    The imports of butter, margarine, and cheese were low ; those of sugar below theaverage for the  year    far ; tea maintained the good level of the previous week.

                                 CONSUMPTION.    Meat. The supplies of home-fed  meat at four  principal markets in the weekending February 23rd were 3 per cent,  below the previous week and little more thanhalf the supply in the corresponding  week last year (Table  B).   There was a furtherfall of 6 per cent, at the Central Market in the week ending March 2nd.  On  theother  hand the supply of foreign meat at  these markets was 37 per cent, above  theprevious week, and only 5^ per cent,  below the supply last year ;  it actually exceededthe supply of home-fed meat.  At the Central  Market there is a slight falling-off inthe week ending March 2nd.    At  the  59 markets  summarised in Table C the supplies of  fat cattle  and offat sheep  increased 7 per  cent,  and 4^ per cent, respectively in  the week  endingFebruary 27th over the supplies of the previous  week.  The supply of  fat cattle atthese  markets has increased every week this year.    At the larger number of more typical  markets  from which we now get returnsthe number of cattle  and sheep  stalled  increased  9 per  cent, and  10 per cent.respectively in the week ended March 2nd over the previous  week.

These  stocks  changed little betweenJanuary 5th and February 2nd, and unless they have been  rapidly depleted duringFebruary the consumption of flour has not increased in that month.    Wholesale Price. The Gazette price of barley fell to 57s. Qd.  in the week endedFebruary 23rd.  It had varied from 58s. Id. to 59s. since January 12th.
