BEE&quot;&quot;&quot;Odosel :hml 12SECRET.          1 7&apos;Copy No *  -if0.1/151/433..7,5,18.POSSIBILITIES OP GUERILLA WARFARE IN RUSSIA.     Guerilla warfare is more difficult now than it was100 years ago, for railways, telegraphs, aeroplanes,armoured cars and machine guns are against it,  It istrue that modern communications are vulnerable and theRussian Armies in 1914 very difficult by continuallycutting telegraph and telephone wires and by murderingorderlies, but the German Command would soon put a stop tothis sort of thing if tried on in Russia by making villagesresponsible.     Much has been written in Russia of the guerillaattacks of the Russian peasantry on Napoleon1s retreatingArmy in 1812,  These did not amount to anything.  Thepeasants merely cut the throats of stragglers who wouldin any case have died of cold.     Any success gained by the Spanish guerillas in thePeninsula War was as much owing to the presence of organisedBritish troops on Spanish and Portuguese territory as to alavish expenditure of British gold.There are undoubtedly many and increasing elements ofdiscontent in Russia, and our policy should be directed tomaking the most of them.  The Bolsheviks have so far suc-ceeded because they have appealed to the lowest Instinctsof the psople, cowardice, laziness and cupidity, but theirdays are numbered, for they have alienated the Church andall the decent elements in the country.     Local discontent will soon -spring up against theGermans,  If they wish to get grain in any quantity theywill have to requisition it for they have no material tobarter with the peasants of the Ukraine,  and the peasants                                                   ofpopulation of East Prussia made the direction of theJ
of Northern Russia will be left to starve.     The Letts in Oourland will not long remain on goodterms v/ith the German proprietorso     If we are to get any real value from thoso who are,or may become, hostile to Germany and to Bolsheviks, wemust form military bases of reliable foreign elements onRussian soilo         Our agents at Stockholm or Tehranmight distribute large sums to swashbuckler Russians butthey would get no results o     The further West these bases are the better, for thoywill be the better able to control the distribution of theproducts that the Central Powers require from Russia..These products are grain from the Ukraine, NorthernCaucasia, Volga Governments and Western Siberia, oil fromCaucasia, cotton from Turkestan, butter from Siberia.  Ifwe continue our policy of abandoning the loyal elementsof Russia to their fate, the enemy will probably carrysuch of these products as he requires up the Danube,shipping from Nikolaev, Novorossisk and Batoum, and usingcoal from the Donetz region to work the railways.     It Is urged that the Caucasian and Japanese projectsare necessary preliminaries to the organisation of guerillawarfare.   The position has been rendered more difficult byour delay.   However, once the Caucasian Mission can reachthe Armenian country, it has plenty of material to work onin the Armenians, Georgians, Caucasian mountaineers andCossacks0   If the Japanese could be induced to move asfar West as Chelyabinsk,- a British or Allied Missionaccompanying them could make use of patriotic Russians  toextend Allied influence further West.      Numbers ofRussians would welcome Japanese intervention and such men                                                  -  of

Any early agreement as to Japanese  interventionand encouragement to the Japanese to act quickly  andthoroughly, together with an energetic policy on  Persianfrontier, so as to open the road to the Caucasus,constitute the best means still at our disposal of dev-eloping military opposition to the enemy1s  design onRussia.
