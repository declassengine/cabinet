The American Military Representative presents his complimentsto his colleagues and has the honour to advise them that he  inquiredof his Government by cable as to the status of the nitrate supplyin the United States, in view of the statement contained in  sub-paragraph 1 of the 6th paragraph of Joint Note No. 13 to the effectthat Great Britain has a &quot;comparatively amall stock of nitrate left,whilst France has almost, and Italy entirely exhausted their stocks&quot;,   2.  The following cabled reply has been received :            &quot;There are reserves of nitrate in United States       sufficient for two months for manufacture in this country       of explosives for ourselves and Allies.  The tonnage  has       been allotted for 125,000 tons a month.  Total nitrate       requirements are 150,000 tons a month of which our explos-       ive programme remainder of year requires 650,000 and  that       of our Allies 417,000 tons.  Commercial needs are estimated       at 585,000 tons,  but it may be necessary to reduce com-       merci&amp;l supplies.  Additional tonnage for 25,000 tons       monthly will be requested from Ship Control Committee to       meet the requirements shown above.  Including commercial       needs 26,500 tons of nitrate were diverted during January       from United States to Prance and England.  Arrangements       are now being made to divert 12,000 additional to France.       Reserve stocks in United States so low that further diver-       sionsare impossible.  By international agreement a Nitrate       Executive has been established in London.  Demands on us       for nitrates should come through him.&quot;                                     (Sgd.)
