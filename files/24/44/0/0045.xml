CONFIDENTIAL.&quot;  7    I CIRCULATE a translation of a letter which T have  received from  the ItalianMinistry of Munitions.                                                  WINSTON  S.  CHURCHILL.    March 7, 1918. Excellency.                                            Rome, February 27, 191.8.    I have received your letter of the 5th instant, and learn with much concern thatafter next Jane Great Britain will be unable to continue  sending shell-steel to Italy.Such steel is absolutely necessary to this country, because the Italian steel works havebeen obliged by the serious deficiency of coal to reduce their own  production by morethan two-fifths, and the situation shows no sign of improving.    I mast therefore  beg your  Excellency  to do  everything  possible to secure  theiransmissiou to Italy of the promised 56,000 tons of shell-steel at the earliest moment.and to grant a continuance for  the second  hall&apos; of this  year  of the progressive transmission by land  if sea transport is impossible-of an equal  quantity of the above-mentioned steel of which, I repeat, our need is extreme.    As  your Excellency knows  well, our  tonnage  from America has been  muchdiminished by the  special  necessity of importing  grain.  The  quantity of steel fromAmerica  on  which  we were counting has thereby been reduced  to such small pro-portions that without English aid the situation will become excessively  serious.    I therefore hope that your Excellency will consent to  reconsider the question inthe light of what I have said above.    I take  the   opportunity  to  exchange  the  most  cordial  greetings with yourExcellency.                                                               A.  DA LI,OLIO.
