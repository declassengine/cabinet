234i.Gable from Mr. Owen Smith, received. 20th November.! 55745.  For Poodminders from Owen Smith for Executive:-   He have received intimation from the U.S. Food Administration,asbington, that a plan of procedure has been evolved to be followed inarchases of fresh meat and packinghouse products for the following buyer   The U.S. Army and Navy and other Government Departments.   American Red Cross.   Allied countries of Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, Belgium and  others.   Purchases for these buyers will be handled by a Department in the U.S.food Administration designated &quot;Division of Co-ordination of Purchase,&quot; and Packers1 Committee has been constituted to work with this body.   So far as we represent or  act for the Allies above mentioned, theIrocedure we shall have to follow is:-  (1) On or before 15th day of each month we must furnish to the Division      of Co-ordination of Purchase a statement showing the actual re-      quirements which each Ally is ready to purchase for shipment during      the following calendar month.  (2) At the same time we must furnish a statement showing estimated re-      quirements for  the five calendar months succeeding the calendar      month for which actual requirements are shown as in head  (l).  (3) The total actual requirements of all purchasers enumerated in first      sentence of this cable will be tabulated by the Division  of Co-      ordination of Purchase and allotted among the packing houses by the      Packers&apos; Committee.  (4) After allotments are made among, and  accepted by, the packers the      quantities covering the approved requirements of each Ally will be      tendered to each Ally through the Division of Co-ordination of      Purchase.   Said tenders shall be for  immediate  acceptance or re-      jection by the Ally concerned.  Contracts will be made by each Ally      with the packers as  at present.  (5) Conferences will be held at the offices of the Division of Co-      ordination of Purchase  on or about the 2 5th of each month, attended      by all parties  interested, ?rhen prices that are  &quot;fair and just&quot;to:      apply to purchases for  shipment during the following month will be      ascertained.    The first meeting will be held this month.  (5) Current contracts of the Allied Governments shall be filled in      accordance with the terms thereof, but, as soon  as this plan is      definitely adopted, no  further contracts  for  food products above      named shall be  entered  into/dependent  of  this plan.                                 in    In view of the supreme control of the IJ.S.Food Administration over the &apos;port of  foodstuffs, we can only acquiesce  in the above proposed plan,, hut J any case we should decide to do so, as we  consider it fair and workable, * obtaining our supplies on the same  terms as U.S. Arm?/ and Navy.    Further, we understand  steps are  being taken to  control  the  prices of -e products by limitation of packers&apos; profits and of the prices  which they ttl  pay  farmers for hogs.    You  will note, under head  (l) above, the  words &quot;actual requirements &apos;ich each Ally is ready to  purchase.&quot;  This  of course raises the questions ?finance and shipping facilities, both  of which must be provided for by &apos;e respective Governments before you  give the actual requirements referred ;in head  (1).    As  U.3. Food Administration intend to put  above  plan into operation for i(*ember  purchases,  it  is essential we receive  Immediately  the figures of  oh toal requirements  (i.e. buying orders)  of  each  Ally for that month, other- se  we  shall be left  out of the- allotment and run grave risk of  not being fle  to  obtain  our requirements.                           oOo---.......
