CRtf/039.                 WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XXXIX.                      (March 7th, 1918).       The negotiations at Brest Litovsk which opened on December 22  came    their final conclusion on March 3 with the formal signature  of peace.   An examination of the attitude of the Bolshevik  Government during the negotiations shows that there were three  distinct currents.  The first current represented by Lenin was  in favour of an immediate peace on the ground that the Russian  armies could not fight in their present condition and that the  prolongation of the negotiations would merely lead to a worse  peace a month or two months later.  Lenin, with all his revolutionary  fervour, is more of a realist than his colleagues.  Lacking the  brilliance of Trotski and Radek, and without any special gifts  as an orator, he is more evenly-balanced and less likely to lose  his head in times of crisis;  he also possesses greater constructive  ability than any of the other Bolshevik leaders.  According to  information supplied to the writer by Kamenev, a member of the  early delegations at Brest, Lenin never swerved In his view as to  the necessity of an immediate peace.  He maintained that it was  absolutely essential that Russia should have some months&apos; respite  to recover both morally and materially, and that at the end  of  this period a new army filled with revolutionary fervour would  &quot;fight like devils&quot;.  At the early stages of the negotiations  at the end of last December Lenin was in a minority and he did  not feel justified In insisting on his views being carried out.jl The opposition was led by Radek, the brilliant but net-headed   SECRET.
Polish Socialist, who has identified himself during the lasttwo months with the party that demands war a ouisrance againstGerman Imperialism.  Radek hadl a considerable following, but inface of Lenin1s opposition it was necessary to find seme via mediabetween immediate peace and an immediate rupture of the negotiations.It was this via media that Trctski sought to find, and during theearly stages of the negotiations Trotski&apos;s policy was adopted.His view was that sooner or later peace would have to be signed,but that every effort should be made to spin out the negotiationsas long as possible.  Tha latter might bo used as a means ofexposing tho German rulers to their own people and of rallying theproletariat of Western Europe to the peace principles of thoBolsheviks.  If the negotiations were prolonged much might happenin the meaintime;  in any case if the Germans proved threateningpeace could be concluded before it was too late.  This policy,which ended so disastrously owing to Trotski1s miscalculations,was never really approved by Lenin, who remarked at the time&quot;This compromise with- Trotski will cost us Pskov&quot;.     The final failure of Trotski1s policy md his formalcapitulation are fresh in the memory.   His acquiescence in thesigning of peace after his bold talk at Brest was a rude shockto those who maintained that under no circumstances would theBolsheviks prove false to their principles.  The explanation ofTrotski*s change of front is that he lost his nerve at the lastmoment when he heard that the army at the front was melting awaywithout any attempt at fighting;  he realised that he had overshotthe mark and saw no way out save to  adopt the views advocated byLenin from the very beginning.  Tr^tskils via media had disappearedand there were now two clearly defined parties - that led by Lenin,who by reason of his great personal  influence, commanded amajority in the Sovyet, and that led by Radek with the support
of most of the Left Social Revolutionaries.  At the same timeTrotski has now clearly stated that the peace is not a real oneand must soon be succeeded by the declaration of war either onthe part of Russia or Germany.     Though Lenin has had his way and peace has been formallysigned, It is by no means certain that hostilities will cease;  inany case there can be no real peace between two Governments of suchfundamentally different views.  Hftiere Lenin differs from hiscolleagues is in the best tactics to be adopted against GermanImperialism.   He mai ntains that the European Revolution cannotccme yet, that Russia1s main contribution must be to save her ownRevolution and build up a Socialist Republic which will in duecourse be a most powerful instrument against German Imperialism.But for this purpose immediate peace, if not a sine qua non, is atany rate the safest course.   The war party, on the other hand, saythat the Bolsheviks, as International Socialists, can under noconditions sign a peace false to their principles, for by so doingthey strike a deadly blow at the cause of social revolutionthroughout Europe.  They must continue the war whatever theconsequences.  It is this question which has to be settled ct thecoming Congress of the Sovyets in Moscow on March 12.  Presentindications seen to show that the majority will be in favour ofwar, but this may largely depend on what move the Germans may, makein the meantime.  It is impossible to foretell what the Germanplans will be;  whether they will march on Petrograd, or, whatseems more likely, occupy the Ukraine and sweep down to Odessa.Russia and Japanese Intervention.     Japanese intervention  in Siberia would be strongly resented
amongst every class in Russia.  It would undoubtedly lead to bitterfeeling against the Entente and the blame will be laid uponBritain in particular.  The Bolsheviks will, of course, say tothe people:  &quot;This is what we always told you.   All the ImperialistGovernments are hastening to  divide the spcil.  fthile theGermans are seizing the Western provinces, Japan is occupyingSiberia and England Archangel and Murmansk&quot;.  Attacks such asthese will readily be believed and will help the Bolsheviksto justify their policy in the eyes of the people.  But thechief danger is that Germany will profit by the outcry againstthe Entente to attempt a reconciliation with Russia,   There islittle doubt that if the average Russian were asked to choosebetween Germany and Japan he would choose the former, and it isnot unlikely that Germany will endeavour to make the choice aslittle disagreeable as possible.  If resistance worth anythingis offered to the Germans by the Bolsheviks it can only be asa result of real revolutionary fervour, as Russia^ presentcondition is a desperate one, and anything, such as Japan1sintervention in Siberia, which wpuld weaken the present hatredagainst Germany might go far to break the resistance that otherwisemay yet be offered after Germany&apos;s shameless policy of violenceand annexation.7.3.18.
