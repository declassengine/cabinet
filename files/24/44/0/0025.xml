His Britannic fviajesty^ Government.)fThis Document is the Property ofif63AMERICA AND SHIPPING.                  When America entered the War not only did the Alliesy^Wj^^xpect her to be self supporting in the matter of tonnagef  iS II     with Minute No * 0 of War Cabinet&apos; 555.-urn submitted by, the Shipping Controller in accordance(especially as almost her first step was to requisition some800.000 tons d.w. Qf British shipping building in Americanyards) but they confidently anticipated that she would he in aposition to make a substantial and steadily increasing ccn-tributicn to the common cause.          On 20th November 1917 the Prime Minister informedColonel House and the American Mission categorically that GreatBritain could not spare a single ton to assist America intransport.          At the Paris Conference of November and Decemberthe Allies, including the American representatives, unanimouslydecided to present and recommend to the American Government, aprogramme involving the immediate allocation by America of500,000 tons (increasing ultimately to 1,250,000 tons) for theservice of Prance and Italy, and the provision of 300,000 tonsof tankers to increase the dangerously low fuel reserve of theNavy and release double bottoms for the carriage of grain.          These expectations have so far been grievously dis-appointed.          Not only has the amount of tonnage placed in theservice of the Allies been insignificant and far short of the newtonnage taken over from Great Britain, but in spite of the PrimeMinister&apos;s categorical statement as to our inability to help..we have In fact - no doubt under pressure of the urgent need ofadditional/
additional man power in Prance - given very material assistanceunder tho following heads:-     (I)  American troops In British liners.     (II) Conveyance of 92,740 American troops and their baggageetc. through England, involving railway strain, and Cross-Channel,involving serious strain on Channel tonnage.    (Ill) The provision of American supplies, particularly woollenclothing and foodstuffs, in the United Kingdom has been equivalentto supply of tonnage for Trans-Atlantic transport.     (IV) These supplies, estimated at 70,000 tons, have had to besent across Channel in British tonnage^ and It is alarming tolearn that contracts continue to be placed, now amounting tosomething like 400,000 tons deadweight, exoluding coalo     (V)  In France General Nash roports that 6 to 8,000 British/French wagons have been given over to the Americans for themoving of their material and up to the present not one wagon hasarrived in Prance from America.   The result is to aggravate theexisting shortage of wagons in Prance and to add greatly to thedifficulty of sending coals through to Italy by rails          These are contributions which we could&apos; not afford tomake.   We have had in addition to assume the sole burden ofmaking good the serious deficiency in the Allied cereal harvestswith the result that our own supplies are in extreme peril.   Thecoal shortage in Italy is acute,   Prance either cannot or willnot, and we cannot, give the necessary help - though a desperateeffort is being made at this moment to narrow the margin ofdeficiency - and there is now imminent danger of the collapseof all the supply arrangements of all the Allies unless Americaoan be persuaded at once to take the most drastic action for therelease of tonnage for Allied Service4.                              i                                                 The/
          The Shipping Controller submits that the time has comewhen the position must be faced in a most definite way withAmerica, as unless a stand is made America will tend to leanmore and more on us and will never take a proper place in the war;          In particular the Shipping Controller urges that thearrangements under which supplies for the American Army (clothing,transportation, material, $tc.) have been furnished from thiscountry should at once be reviewed.          He Is convinced that in many instances these arrange-ments are Indefensible from a tonnage standpoint, but even iffrom the general allied tonnage point of view it were moreeconomical on paper to send the supplies from this country,the fact would still remain that unless the American burden isplaced on American shoulders, an adequate contribution ofAmerican tonnage will never be obtained.   We have been toocomplaisant In the past and have created a false conception ofthe extent of our resources.          Farther, the Shipping Controller submits that theforegoing considerations require that the recent agreement toprovide tonnage for a further 150,000 American troops should hereviewed.         . The proposal put forward by the Restriction of ImportsCommittee in December was that the British Government should offerto transport extra American troops on two definite conditions:(a) that the American Government should give compensation intonnage and(b) that the men should be included in the British Army so as tobe in substitution for British recruits who would otherwisehave to be withdrawn from home production.          The Ministry of Shipping pointed out the serious effect                                                  ,  whi oh/
which such an arrangement must have upon the importing capacityof British vessels but it was decided upon in view of the greatadvantages anticipated from the above two conditions.           The Agreement as concluded,  however)  does not appear tc meet either condition.   Moreover the situation has altered recently in the following respects:-      (a)  The food position has become steadily worse and is new of extreme gravity.      (b)  Three of the vessels which would have been used for the purpose - the &quot;ANDANIA&quot;,  &quot;AURANIA&quot; and &quot;TUSCANIA11 have been tor- pedoed.      (c)  It is clear from the figures now obtained from the American Authorities that the American Government is already experiencing difficulty in arranging supplies for the numbers they anticipated transporting and that the increase in these numbers by the use cf British troop carrying tonnage is bound to render mere difficult,  and perhaps impossible, the provision of American cargo  tonnage on which the Allies are  relying for the transport of absolutely vital imports.           In this connection General Nash states emphatically that unless the American Army import the necessary transportation material before increasing the numbers of their personnel,  it will not be possible to make that personnel Into an efficient fighting machine from a transportation point of view.    He  points&apos;cut that the absence of American rolling stock  in Prance can only result, if the American Army is to go on increasing in numbers, in congestion at the ports  and resultant delay to  ship- ping.    The congestion exists now.           The extent to which the conveyance of the 150,000 extra American troops will reduce our imports of food etc*  will depend (a) upon what French and Italian passenger vessels we  are able to obtain, and (b) upon the date by which the men  must all arrive in                                                   France/
   * * *France.   In any event, however, the arrangement must affect ourimporting-capacity prejudicially.          The following conclusions therefore seem inevitable:-     (1)  America must provide a substantial amount of cargotonnage to enable the European allies to carry on.     (2)  The provision of this tonnage and the necessary cuttingoff simultaneously of a large proportion of the suppliespreviously furnished from this country, will greatly aggravatethe difficulty - which is already being experienced - of providingcargo tonnage necessary to keep the American Army supplied.     (3)  Accordingly all further increase in the personnel of theAmerican Army should1 be suspended for the time being.     (4)  The transport of American troops at the rate alreadydetermined may continue; but all such troops, whether broughtin American or British ships. should be Incorporated in theBritish Army,&apos; where, as part of an established organization, theycan be maintained without imposing any material strain on tonnage,     (5)  The temporary-transfer to the British forces of partof the existing American Army in France may even have to becontemplated If America proves unable both to keep that Armysupplied and to provide the Allies with the additional tonnagewhich is essential in order to tide over the present emergency.
