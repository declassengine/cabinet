This DocHis Brijt,y&apos;8 Government.^military Secret.913rom Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,23rd Ma//1919.2138. Your Foreign Department telegram elated 21st May. The information that you now give and the argument that you elaborate on it are quite convincing. I entirely agree with you as to the importance of grappling resolutely with the Afghan menace, and I note with satisfaction that you consider your display of force and determined action in ejecting Afghan troops from British territory and seizing Dakka have steadied the tribes, have done much to rally India, and may possibly even have sown, seeds in. Afghanistan of a reaction against Amanullah and his policy.2. 1 appreciate the advantages of an occupation of Jelialabad, set forth in paragraph 10 of your telegram under reference, and, therefore, authorise the advance to that place. It is a matter for regret that this advance has become necessary at this time of the year when the climate in the valley of the &quot;Kabul River is very unhealthy. This makes it all the more important that you should he sure before advancing that you have ample transport to bring up the good food, liberal tentage, and medical supplies that will undoubtedly be necessary.3. You will, I am confident, not have forgotten the lessons of history that we have not so much to fear from the Afghan regular army as from the irregular tribesmen, and their constant attacks on ourTines of communi-, cati6n and isolated camps, and you will no doubt have provided troops in sufficient quantity and of good quality to hold the line and to protect your convoys between Jellalabad and.Peshawar.4. I share with you the hope that it may not be necessary for us to1 proceed beyond Jellalabad, and while I consider it very important for us to display our military strength by an early occupation of that place and by consolidating our position there, I am not without hope that when this has been satisfactorily accomplished, it may be possible to open negotiations with Kabul in some form or another and thus to avoid the risks of a prolonged war.w&quot;I
