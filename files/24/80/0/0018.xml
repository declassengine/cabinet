jyfevDJcument is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]/-VCONFIDENTIAL May 9, 1919.Political Intelligence Department, (11249.)       /9 Foreign Office.France /009.MEMORANDUMONSOCIALISM IN FEANCE.&quot;**TWO memorandums written last year (P.I.D. /003 and /005) dealt with changes in the Socialist Party. Perhaps it may be worth while to &quot;add another, dealing with the Socialist Party Congress, which was held at Easter.It was preceded, as usual, by the meeting of the Socialist Federation of the Seine, which has long been the stronghold of the Extreme Left of the party. This it showed itself to be once more, and more than ever. No doubt this section, both at the Federation and in the Congress, gained additional stimulus from the foolish and criminal acquittal of the murderer of Jaures at the end of March. Paris juries always commit these follies, and it is not easy to see why it is worse to acquit the man who assassinated Jaures than the woman (Madame Oaillaux) who assassinated the editor of the &quot; Figaro.&quot; The latter acquittal was, however, no crime in the eyes of M. Caillaux&apos;s friends of the Left: but these inconsistencies do not disturb the consciences of party rhetoricians; and the acquittal of Villain was, naturally enough, made the occasion of indignant speeches and articles and of a great popular demonstration. Fortified in this way by fresh hatred of the bourgeois, whose repre-sentatives in the jury box had shown their indifference to the death of Jaures, the extremists made very revolutionary speeches, and,&apos; what is more important, showed great voting strength. They did not defeat Longuet, the leader of,the new majority, himself a semi-Bolshevist, but they got twice as many votes as the old National majority. Longuet secured 17 delegates to the Congress; Loriot, the Bolshevist leader 12, ; and the old Majority with the Centre only 6.But the Left have always been very strong in the Seine. Even so long ago as February 1918 the old Majority only got 3 delegates to the Council to the 7 of Longuet and 2 Kienthahan or Bolshevist; and for the October Congress, in spite of a successful speech by Thomas, the Seine only provided the Majority with 12 delegates out of 46, while Longuet got 27, the Centre 4, and the Extremists 4. At that time no doubt many Extremists voted for Longuet, as their own chance had clearly not come, and the first step was to help him to overthrow Thomas and Eenaudel. They may not be much more numerous now, but they are strong enough to come into the open. Whatever the explanation the fact is striking enough that they now get more than a third of the Delegation, while in October they got less than one-eleventh.The Congress showed the same movement, though not to the same extent. Longuet has to maintain his position between the two oppositions of Eight and Left. Though he always makes himself the apologist of Bolshevism, he dare not commit the party to Bolshevism, and consequently to save himself from those who are quite ready for that or any other extravagance he has to keep on terms with as many as he can of the Eight. So, finding himself not able to get any text unanimously adopted for the electoral programme of the party, he chose one that could be accepted by Thomas, and faced the opposition of the Bolshevists. They submitted two alternative texts, of which that proposed by Loriot obtained 245 votes, and that of Verfeuil 2&apos;96. The official programme obtained 1,394. The Extremists were thus very easily defeated. But their power is seen in the programme which defeated them. It includes not only such items as the abolition of the Senate, universal suffrage for both sexes, the conscription of capital, the giving a share to the State in all businesses sufficiently concentrated to allow of it, which are all more or less familiar Socialist projects, but a Constituent Assembly for the reform of the Constitution, and a referendum giving the &quot; initiative&quot; to the people (that is, the right to command the Parliament to pass a particular law), neither of which seem to be necessarily involved in Socialist theory; no doubt they are signs of the prevailing impatience with Parliamentarism. Most significant of all, while some saving clauses are put in about the party desiring social peace and order, and not confounding revolution and violence, it not only declines to [1130]-630
renounce &quot; any means of struggle&quot; for the revolution, but announces that &quot; whatever may be the form in which the revolution comes it will probably be followed by a period of dictatorship,&quot; which must be exercised by the &quot; proletariat politically and ecouornic-ally organised.&quot;It is clear that Bolshevism, if officially defeated at the Congress, lias gone a long way in educating its temporary masters in the party. For the rest the programme is, as usual with Socialist pronouncements, an extremely verbose, doctrinaire, and one would suppose, for electioneering purposes, most ineffective document. It is divided into six parts. The first attempts the difficult task of proving that the war was the result of capitalism and is the j ustificatiori of Socialism. The second is devoted to the social revolution and its necessary preliminary, the dictatorship of the proletariat. The third gives the actual programme, the chief items of which have already been quoted. The fourth deals with economic restoration on familiar Socialist lines, and denounces any policy of retrenchment. The fifth proposes many labour and other &quot; social &quot; reforms on familiar &quot;advanced&quot; lines. The sixth discusses the International organisa-tioo &quot;of peace, wants &quot;all the peoples&quot; united in a Society of Nations, and exhibits the usual indiffeience of Socialists to the fact that the law of gradual growth is the first law of politics. It proposes to entrust to the infant Society of Nations such functions as the control of the conditions of production, and the transport and tariffs of the different countries belonging to it.But to return from these clouds to the actual proceedings of the Congress. This business of the programme was, of course, the most important submitted to it: and perhaps the most important fact about it is not anything which it contained (except, indeed, thjs approval of a dictatorship of the proletariat), but the support which it obtained from moderate men like Thomas and Renaudel. Thomas spoke, and was listened to with great attention. He declared that he adhered with all his mind and soul to its doctrines. But he pointed out that it contained nothing contradicting the policy which he and the old Majority had followed during the war, and nothing which placed democracy and socialism in opposition. It is evident that certain phrases, such as one which fixes the primary responsibility for the war on the Central Powers, were inserted to secure him and his friends. It is less easy to see how he reconciles a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, which he defended, with his assertion that there was nothing in the programme separating socialism from democracy.There were two other big divisions in the Congress.   One was about a manisfesto of the party, another very wordy document containing the usual economic assertions of the party, implying that all countries were equally to blame for the war, declaring that the class war implies the systematic refusal of all votes for either the military or civil services of the country, refusing to permit any alliance at elections between the candidates of the party and those of any other group, warning the people that the society of nations as likely to be constituted by the Conference will only be a league of capitalists, denouncing intervention in Russia, and finally attacking the policy of uncertainty and compromise pursued by the party during the war.   For this, of course, the old Majority could not vote.   They abstained to the number of 789, while 232 Bolshevists voted for an alternative motion.   The motion of the majority obtained 902 votes.   The chief interest of the speeches lay in the attitude of May eras, formerly an extreme supporter of Longuet, whose attitude on the war was so little to the taste of the Boshevists that they denounced him as having become a &quot; jusqu&apos;au-boutiste,&quot; to which he replied that he had been all through the war in favour of the policy of national defence, and was in no way ashamed of being so still.   There was also an interesting speech from M. Grumbach, the Alsatian (he and the other Alsatians agreed not to vote in any of the divisions), who roundly declared that Germany was guilty, and was only defeated by the arms of the Allies, whose victory had alone delivered both Germany and Russia from tyranny.    This speech was a striking contrast to that made in the debate on the programme by  M. Verfeuil, the  Bolshevist, who created a storm of protest,  led by the mayors of Lens and  Roubaix, by  saying  &quot; our atmosphere   is   still  poisoned   because   we   are   still   dragging   the  chain  of victory.&quot;    Finally,  the Congress   decided its&apos; position   with   reference   to  the International.    As to this there  were three  motions.    One  proposed  to join the &apos;i hird  International proposed  by  Lenin and Trotsky and accepted by the Italian and Swiss Socialists.   In opposition to this, Mayeras proposed unconditional affiliation to the Second International, which succumbed in 1914 and met again at Berne the other day,   He had at the Seine meeting fiercely denounced the traitor Guilbeaux, who after being condemned to death for his dealings with the Germans is claiming to represent the French proletariat in Russia, and he now strongly attacked
378him as a dubious adventurer, and declared Lenin&apos;s International to be a mere fraudulent sham. Grumbach said the same, was howled down by the Bolshevists, and left the tribune in indignation, saying he would tell the Alsatians how he had been received. The third motion was presented by Longuet, and adhered to the Second International on condition that its &quot;executive&quot; was purged -this &quot;purge&quot; is admittedly aimed at Vandervelde and Branting, who had denounced Bolshevism), and that it returned to the principles of the class war and &quot; followed the example of Russia and Germany in guiding the International towards the social revolution.&quot; This last motion was carried, receiving 894 votes against 757 for that of Mayeras, and 270 for the motion in favour of adherence to LenhYs International.What does it all come to ? The &quot; Debats &quot; roundly says that the results of the Congress pleased everyone except the Kienthalians or Bolshevists. If so, it would appear, at least at first sight, that the others were easily pleased. After all, every ^successful motion had in it distinct elements of what plain people would certainly regard as Bolshevism. No doubt the avowed Bolshevists were in each case very badly defeated, and the &quot; Debats&quot; may be right in regarding this fact, and the approximation between Longuet and the Right which led to it, as signs proving &quot; the relatively moderate tendencies of the Congress and its preference of evolution to revolution &quot;In confirmation of this view there are a few things to be noted. One is the evident movement of such a man as Mayeras away from the Extreme&apos;Left. Another is the abstention from the Congress of the group of the Forty Deputies who&apos; are on the extreme Right of the party. The defeat of the Bolshevists was accomplished without them. Another may be the respectful treatment accorded to Thomas, in spite of the fact that in one of his speeches he said that he intended to hold himself free to vote the credits as before. Another, perhaps more significant, is the question put. to the Congress by Renaudel: &quot; Is the neo-revolutionism of certain members of the party in accordance with the tendencies of the General Federation of Trade Unions ? &quot;There is the important point. By itself the Socialist Party is of no importance whatever. Even now, after much beating of drums, its members are given by its own organ as 57,000 ; a negligible quantity by itself, as far as a general election is concerned. But how far will it be able to retain or increase its voting power of a million and a-half, as shown at the last election? How far can it keep Labour in its leading strings? Will Labour as a whole make a party of its own, or will it work with the existing Radical parties? The General Confederation declared recently, in a manifesto to the peasants, that it was a trades union or &quot;professional&quot; organisation, not a political one. Its leaders are known to have been at first opposed to the procession on the 1st May, and were said to have been only pushed into it by the Bolshevist Socialist Loriot. Some reports declare that the soldiers, though committing no acts of violence like the police, who are generally condemned for their rough treatment of the demonstrators, were yet by no means sympathetic with them, regarding them as embusques who had had an easy time and high wages while they were suffering and dying in the trenches at 5 sous a day. These are the three elements who will decide the fate certainly of the Socialist Party and perhaps of France the workmen, the peasants, and the soldiers. Of the latter 80 per cent, are peasants. Will they support a semi-Bolshevist Socialist Party ? Will the workmen be conciliated by the measures, such as the eight-hours law passed the other day, which already Parliament is taking in their favour, or will their strong class feeling make compromise and conciliation impossible ? The French workman is very &quot; heady,&quot; and has always been fonder of abstract rhetoric than his English brothers; but Frenchmen are even shrewder and more alive to the interests of their pockets than Englishmen. Who can tell how these conflicting tendencies will work out at an election ?On the whole, if a prophecy must be made-and it is made with great diffidence  the probability seems to be that the Socialist Party will move more to the Left, but return fewer deputies, and very possibly split up into quarrelling sections. The &quot; Forty &quot; Deputies can hardly retain their places in a semi-Bolshevist party, though they still remain more or less under the party discipline, as may be seen by Compere MoreTs resignation after the 1st May of the minor office he still held. They are often said to have no following in the rank and file of the party, and though they assert the contrary even in private, this is probably true. But a more important question is what following have they outside the party ? It seems likely that many of the same sort of people voted for them who voted for the Majority Socialists in Germany. Most of such people will probably shrink from a semi-Bolshevist Socialism, and will either vote no more for Socialists or will vote for such Socialists as Longuet and his friends will find an embarrassment rather thai., a support.   Thomas always remains on the fence, and
Ilenaudel has for two years been crying unity when unity in fact there was none. They will have ultimately either to oppose Longuet or to sink into insignificance as his followers. Their weakness of political character and their fondness for the abstract theories of their party makes it quite likely that they will do the latter. But if so they will simply have been swallowed up and will disappear. And a party which crushes or sheds all the men who, like Bran ting, Vandervelde, and Thomas, and even Vnrenne and Compere Morel, have had some actual experience of great affairs will, to say the least, run the risk of becoming a mere quarrelsome and verbose debating society of rhetoricians.A good deal of the increased success which the Socialists seem to have h;;d during the last few months, if one may judge by the alleged great increase in the sale of their newspapers, has been due to the apparent failure of the Peace Conference and the general atmosphere of expectation as to social and labour reforms. And a further fillip has been given by the violence of the police on May Day in Paris. But in the rest of France the demonstrations passed off quietly, and seem to have aroused no great interest. Nor did the Chamber show much interest in the attempt of the Socialists to raise a debate on the crimes of the Government and the police on May Day. Of course its mind was filled with more important matters. Now that the peace terms are announced, the Government may recover some of its lost prestige, especially if they are accepted and begin to be carried out. And the eight hours law and other reforms of a similar order may quiet down the excitement in Labour circles. One cannot be sure. All one can say is that the prospect on the whole appears better than it did a few weeks ago.P.S. Further details received since this was v/ritten tend, on the whole, to confirm the view taken. May eras, who used to be thought one of the most advanced men, now writes cautiously about the Congress, saying that the present is scarcely the moment for &quot;liquidating the capitalist regime,&quot; and doubting whether any of those who voted for the Bolshevist revolution, would really &quot; go to Moscow.&quot; It is less surprising to find the &quot;,France Libre,&quot; the organ of the Forty, pointing out that it will not be easy to win over the peasants; and adding that it will not be done by frightening them : if they are really opposed to the revolution it will not only fail but will give rise, the &quot; France Libre&quot; thinks, to a most brutal repression.It may be noted that a feminine orator of the Bolshevist faction frankly declared that their object was to get free of any obligation to support Longuet and his new majority, which in her view was identical with the old. If this means anything, which it may not, it means that between the Forty on the one side and the Bolshevists on the other it will be quite impossible to maintain the unity of the party.The Socialist interpellation about the conduct of the Government on the 1st May ended in a vote of confidence being passed by 356 to 1; the Socialists leaving the Chamber before the Minister of the Interior spoke, as a protest against the absence of M. Clemenceau.o
