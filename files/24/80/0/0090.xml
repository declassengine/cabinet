As a matter of urgency. I circulate for the Information of the War Cabinet, the following Memorandum relative to a difficulty which has arisen between my   Department and the Board of Education as to the Temporary Occupation off&apos; School premises at Albany Street, Cardiff.and ask for a decision.(Sgd)   L.Worthington Evans,The iYar Cabinet have approved the decentralisation of certain functions of the Ministry of Pensions and under the scheme a Wales Region has been inaugurated with headquarters at Cardiff.-The Office of.Works propose the Albany Road Schools, about to be vacated by the Army Medical authorities, as suitable temporary accommodation for the Ministry Regional Headquarters staff pending the acquisition of permanent buildings.The Local Education Authorities are understood to be willing to place the Schools at cur disposal and explain that It will not be practicable owing to labour shortage to commence the work of.re-adapting the School for Educational purposes before September, by which date it is expected that permanent, accommodation for the Regional Headquarters staff will be available*.    The President of the Board of Education is not prepared to sanction the occupation of the Schools by the.Ministry staff,     . *I consider it of the utmost importance,.if the scheme of decentralisation is to be successfully administered that the Regional Headquarters Staff, which is estimated to number fromft 400 to 500 persons, should&apos;be housed temporarily in the Albany Road Schools which are the only really suitable premises immediately available.   \.L.Y/.E.
