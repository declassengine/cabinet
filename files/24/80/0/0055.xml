ACTI3SG-PKESIDEST of tho BOARD OF (GRADE AND THE MINISTER OF MUNITIONS.In accordancevith the decision taken at the Meeting of Ministers on Monday, 19th May, we mot the Prime Minister of Australia.on the 20th May, and informed him of the terms of-the-arrangements which His Majesty1s Government were prepared to make as to Australian Load and Copper  -applies .   These inrolv^dr in the case of Lead the purchase at a fired price of 130,000 tons of Pig up to April 1st, 19J?C, and 65^000 tons in the following six months at a fize-d price of  18 per ton less ifo net fooob. Sydney, the British Government bearing any loss on resale and any profit being divided equally between the British Government and the Australian producers,   is regards Copper, the proposal was that the British Government should purchase 25,000 tons during the next 12 months, at the price for electrolytic ccopper of  80 per ton, less ifo net f.o.b. Sydney, and subject to adjustment as to other qualities.After consultation with his trade Advisors, Mr.Hughes informed us on the 21st May that, whilst the Copper proposals were acceptable to the interests concerned, the Lead proposals were not acceptable, as the Australian producers did not desire a purchase by the British   Government, but only a guarantee of a minimum price.   Tio pointed   out that His Maicstyrs Government did not see their way to give a guarantee and regarded a purchase as the only practicable course.   Any scheme of purchase being inaoeeptabls to the Australian interests, the possibility was suggested of an arrangement whereby the, British Government stock of Lead and the current Australian output should be pooled so far as related to sales in the United Kingdom, and that sales should be made in such mannar as might be agreed on so as tosafeguard the interests of both parties.   We informed Mr.Hughes that we would be prepared to consider favourably an arrangement of the kind and Mr.Robinson, the   representative of the Australian-producers, was instructed&apos; to prepare a Draft Scheme.   This was submitted on the 22nd May, and after consultation with our advisers we informed Mr.hughes that the scheme was not acceptable to us as it related to European sales generally and not merely to sales in the United Kingdom, and, further, under its provisions the liquidation of the Government stocks would be very greatly    j retarded.   Mr. Hughes stated that,he also, from a different point of view, objected to the scheme, since it appeared to him to be  \ a hard commercial bargain, which paid no regard to the services ; which Australia generally, and the Australian Lead producers particularly, had rendered daring the war.  We informed Mr. Hughes that we were quita unable to admit that interpretation; and that in the circumstances it did  not appear to us that any arrangement was practicable, or that any useful purpose would be served by further discussion^We had previously informed-Mr.Hughes that, in our opinion/ the Copper and Lead proposals must be taken together, and that, failure to arrive at&apos;any agreement as to Lead must involve the&apos; Abandonment of the Copper proposals, also. ; iITORFOHTH. &apos;A.C .GED33ES.23rd May 1919.AUSTEALIAJJ LEAD AM) COPPER - MOMTOUM BY THE
