The demand for out-patient treatment for officers and men suffering from functional nervous disorders continues to increase to such an extent that it is impossible for the clinic to take all the cases which require treatment.   A waiting: list of 60 cases having accumulated it was found necessary to limit further recamriendatiohs from the Special Medical Hoard to urgent cases only.   Extension of the clinic is being considered.22.   Panel Treatment in Ireland for demobilised men.   The arrangement made with&quot; the T?a Ional fTealTn&quot; &quot;Insurance Commissioners for Ireland for the extension of medical benefit to discharged disabled men resident in Ireland (Seb Report XC, paragraph 16) have further been extended to demobilised men who establish their claim that they are suffering impairment due to or aggravated by service.   The facilities will also be available to a demobilised man, pending the Ministry&apos;s decision on his claim, provided that a certificate from the Medical Referee that treatment is needed for a disability due to or aggravated by service, is forth coming.23o   Treatment of Officers.(l)    Interim TreatmentUnder Article 6 of the Officers&apos; Warrant of&quot; 1917 an officer &quot;in receipt of retired pay may be allowed treatment.   Treasury sanction has been obtained to permit treatment in advance of the aware of retired pay in cases where it is probable that retired pay or gratuity will ultimately be awarded.   This removes what would have been a hardship to the demobilised, officer requiring treatment for a disablement caused or aggravated by war-serviceIf the disability is subsequently found not to be due to war-service the cost of the treatment is recovered from the gratuity given in non-attributable cases.(2) Numbers and JDisabilities .- The following table shews the treatment provided &quot;&quot;for OfTTcers &quot;during April and the Waiting List; together with the disabilities for which-treatment is being provided:,Provided.

The principal law dealing with Military and Naval pensions dates as far back as 1831.   Dur.ir.ig the War several short enactments have been passed giving temporary relief to discharged; men, but until the present law there has been no comprehensive measure.   - -The introductory Articles make the Law retrospective. All previous assessments are to be modified so as to be in accord, with the previsions of this Law, rejections are to be reconsidered, and prevision is made for payment of arrears on the basis of this La.Wc   This will presumably, entail many hundreds of thousands of re-assessments.The law is divided into five parts.Fart I provides for the assessment of pensions of soldiers or sailors, including all ranks from private to General and&apos; from sailor to Admiral, and gives the rates of children&apos;s allowances.Part II deals with Widows and Orphans:-(l)   in respect of entitlement,(2)   as to assessment of pensions and allowances,(3)   as to forfeiture, and(4)   as to illegitimate children.   &apos;Part III provides for allowances to Ascendants, i.e., parents &amp; granft parents in certain cases.Part IV constitutes courts for deciding questions in dispute, and on appeal, and lays down the procedure to be followed.Part V deals with miscellaneous matters, mainly the application cf the Law, or portions of the Law, to different semi-civilian units auxiliary to the Army.Part I.   Men&apos;s pensions.   The grounds of entitlement are practically similar to those of the Royal warrant except that pensions begin on a 10% disablement, whilst disabilities below that percentage are totally disregarded,   A certified disease arising during mobilisation, or within 6 months of a man&apos;s discharge is presumed to be attributable to service, until the contrary is proved - in the case of men already discharged the 6 months begins from the publication of the law.   There is no Schedule of specific injuries but a decree will be issued classifying disabilities in accordance with their gravity.   Y/here there are several disabilities a man&apos;s pension is increased beyond the scale laid down.   The pension of a private totally disabled, is 2400 francs a year, equal to  96 a year or 37/- a week; a-corporal would get 27/5f a week; a sergeant 37/H a week, and so on by additions of about 5gd per.week. A 2nd Lieutenant would get from  120 to  144 a year ana a Colonel  536 a year.Children&apos;s allowances vary from 300 francs a year (4/7 a week) in the case of total disability, to 30 francs a year in the case of a 10$ disability, for each child, whether the first or the tenth child, up to the age of 18.Partll.Note on French Pension_Lawpassed on the 31st March, 1919.
Part II. Widows and. Children.   Widows are placed In three classes i -(a) Widows of men whose -death was due to war-injuries receive exceptional rates;(b) Widows of men whose death was due to disease contracted or aggravated by service receive normal rates; and(c) Widows of pensioners having a disablement not leas than 60% of total disablement reversional rates.There is a strong presumption in favour of attributability.Marriage must be prior to the disability, except in the case of a woman who marries a man with a disablement of Q0% or oyen, but in such a case the marriage must last one year.If the widow remarries she may either retain half her pension (the other half going to her children till they reach majority) or may receive the capitalized value- of 3 years&apos; pension.The widow of a private would receive 800 francs, or  32 a year (12/3 per week), at &quot;exceptional&quot; or &quot;normal1&apos;&apos; rates, and 500 francs, or  20 a year (7/8 per week), at &quot;reversional&quot; rate.The widow of a sergeant major would receive 1200 francs, or  48 a year (18/5 per week), at the &quot;exceptional&quot; rate, 1050 francs a year (16/- per week) at the &quot;normal&quot; rate, and 800 francs .. (12/3 per week) at the &quot;reversional&quot; rate.It is to be noted that the difference between the &quot;exceptional&quot; and the &quot;normal&quot; rates increases as the rank rises.Forfeiture of the widow&apos;s pension may take place through the action of the Court (a) 7;here her husband had presented a petition for judicial separation or divorce or had expressed in writing his intention of doing so or (2) where the widow had &quot;forfeited the paternal control&quot;,No provision is made with respect to the &quot;separated wife&quot; nor the &quot;unmarried wife11.Children&apos;s allowances are at the rate of 300 francs a year (4/7 per week) for each child up to the age of 18.   If, however, the mother dies the children under 21 receive her pension.   Mother-less children, being minors (under 21), receive the mctherTs pension in addition to the children&apos;s allowances above mentioned for those under 18.   Where a mother remarries and takes the 3 years&apos; gratuity her children, being minors, are given her pension; and if she dees not select the gratuity but retains her pension, half the pension is transferred to the children until the last has reacheo majority.   There is special provision where a man has children by two or more marriages,   Illegitimate children who are recognised are treatea t.&apos;s children of marriage.Part III.__Rights of Ascendants.   The Law provides only forparents and, where these&quot;are no parents, for&apos;grandparents.   Incapacity or age are the main grounds for pension.   The allowances range for 300 francs a year (4/7 per week) tc a grandfather to 800 francs a year (12/3 a week) to a widowed mother,   !For any additional son who has fallen an addition of l/cj- per week may be granted,PART IV
Part IV.__Settlement of matters in Dispute *   In each   .department&quot; of Prance is set up a &quot;Dep aliment a! Pensions Tribunal, and in each Region a Regional Pensions Court.   The Regional Court is the Appeal Court,   The Council of State, anl advisory;Vodf with many functions and acting as a species of Administrative Council to the Government, is the supreme Court of Appeal; this Council also deals with certain questions as a Court of first instance.   The Law fixes the composition of the two first-named tribunals and sets out the procedure to be followed.   Legal assistance is granted to any person who applies for it, proceedings are exempt from stamp duty and registration, but otherwise there is no reference as to who is to pay the costs, except in Article 24 where it is provided that the State shall pay the costs where the public prosecutor fails in an application for the forfeiture of a widow&apos;s pension.Part V.   Miscellaneous provisions *   Fire Brigade men stationed in fortress towns are brought under the law, certain civil functionaries of the Ministries of War and of the Marine are given the benefits of some of the Articles; mobilised men seconded for national work or engaged on railways are given advantages; medical and sanitary units are brought within the law, provision is made for re-enlisted men, and foreigners serving in the French Army are dealt v-ith as French soldiers.Accumulation of pensions for the same service is guarded against; provision is made lor the review of pensions in ca-ve of error, in case of Increase of disability and in certain cases of industrial accident.   The full rate is granted to Algerians, and to soldiers from those Colonies where conscription was in force, special provision being made with respect to Mahometan and Colonial  -&quot; widows and orphans.     Provision is made for medical treatment (Art.64) both by the State and by Benefit Insurance Societies and for men who are insane.The right of a man, unable by reason of his disabilities to ply his former trade, to State assistance is declarer., and the National Office is charged generally with the duty of apprenticing such a man, who may be granted a maintenance allowance (which would be in addition to his pension and.children&apos;s allowances) not less than 1 franc a day nor more than 2 francs a day.15 Tables are appended to the Law.

The answer is : special and lorder-line cases. Here is one typical. An Irish Iroman bereft of her husband and caring for wo children longed to go back to her own people, jihe was faced with heavy fares and the burden I if many pawntickets.   The Boll of Honour fund redeemed the articles and paid her fares. )ver a year ago, the Committee had dealt with ,645 cases, including 3,588 orphans.  This is ood work.  It is also necessary for bridging and jjilling gaps which must occur between what is nd what is not possible out of public funds.That these gaps exist will be obvious to all thinking minds.  Some delay in settlement of claims is unavoidable (Circular 165 N6 Charity,   of April 3rd has just been designedby the Ministry to reduce this to a minimum).  Pensions granted by the State must be governed by regulations.  Begulations once made must be observed.   These are the inevitabilities of pensions granted on a statutory basis and not &quot; out of charity.&quot;  But a host of cases arise which compasaion and gratitude de-mand shall be provided for; cases which have no relationship to wounds or disabilities ; cases which, from the very nature of its functions, the Ministry of Pensions is debarred from helping. Here comes in the Liverpool Boll of Honour Fund, and   such  like voluntary institutions. There is no question of charity.   The men or their widows or children should be helped.   The nation desires that they should be helped and subscribes accordingly, but in such a manner that the funds can be disbursed at discretion.  Besult: Assistance and alleviation to infinite gradations of hardship which could not possibly be legis-lated for.Notably among these voluntary subscriptions, and administered at the discretion of independentTrustees, is the King&apos;s Fund. The King-s Fund. The contributions to this haverecently reached the &quot; million-mark,&quot; including donations of  50,000 from the Straits Settlements and from Mr. Thomas Paul Latham, Deputy Chairman of Courtauld&apos;s, Ltd. The disbursements of this Fund have been averaging something like  15,000 a week. Yet there are those who cavil at it. Why? The odious word &quot; charity &quot; is responsible.  It cannot
be too strongly asserted that the welfare and difficulties of the ex-service man are not subjects for charity. They who subscribe the money to the King&apos;s Fund, or any other fund, would be the first to decry such usage. Charity is for the shipwrecks and failures of life. More useful than opposition to and criticism of these funds would be a set of regulations to cover every case. And that is an impossibility.   Therefore As evidence of the particular activities of the King&apos;s Fund it can be stated that since the first grant on September 25tb, 1918, A Transfer    no fewer than 10,875 cases have of Activities, been dealt with by grants ranging from a few pounds up to  150. Among these are 120 pensioners assisted to be-come taxi-owners. It is, however, no longer to deal with restarting men in business. This func-tion will be taken over by the Civil Liabilities Commission, by which grants will be made out of State funds. But the King&apos;s Fund will remain, not diminished nor curtailed in usefulness, a power to assist the widows and children of those who have fallen in the war; disabled officers and men who need special assistance over, and above what is provided for can also benefit. For instance, the Fund will be available to start widows in business, to assist orphans, to enable disabled officers and men to start life in the Dominions overseas. It is a comfortable Fund, limited in its disbursements only by its Trusteeship.   Therein lies its value.We print elsewhere the Prime Ministers appeal for the employment of disabled soldiers.It is significant that, amid his An Obligation, multifarious Peace pre-occupa-tions, he should have considered, or been told, that such an appeal was desirable. Stark justice -makes the obligation self-evident. Before anyone disabled soldiers deserve prefer-ence: and all those employers whose sense of right has not been smothered by success or frightened by the prospect of industrial corn-petition recognise this fact. It is apparently to the others that the Prime Ministers appeal is made. In addition to their pensions the men want independence. Those who have been dependent on them for safety during these danger years are the ones to assist them to it. If an appeal for this sort of thing is necessary, it should be a demand.As for the wounded so also for the luckier soldier.   The preference to the ex-service man for  employment  need not be Another     limited to the disabled.   Where Obligation,    two applicants for a job are of even approximate suitability, theman who has served should be chosen. It is an obligation. We make no apologies for reiterating what has been proclaimed time and again as a public duty, and professed (in many loud voices) as the one- desire of all. The Prime Minister does not write letters for amusement. So now when we.are all talking so much about a new Heaven and a new Earth, they who have the opportunity can at least start on the Earth, and do a simple thing to make it a better one for the man who has served. As a country our record of behaviour towards the old soldier has been none too creditable in the pastAt a most appropriate time of year Spring, the season of Nature&apos;s resurrection the Houseof Commons has been discussing Land Settlement, the great question of land settle-ment. The returned and return-ing soldier have come in for mention. And natur-ally. It is stated that something like 800,000 men have at one time or another intimated their willingness to settle on the land, and the Board of Agriculture will need to get busy quickly if these men are not to be allowed to drift away into other employments or even other lands because of delay. As great care is, how-ever, required by the men themselves, as by those responsible for framing the conditions. In industrial employment, a man may learn bj imitation and instruction of his neighbour at the bench or desk. But the vagaries of Nature demand a longer apprenticeship ; the infinite subtleties of climate, soil and weather-wisdom present pitfalls for the inexperienced. The intending settler good luck to him ! wants to make quite sure that his inclination is a goodj deal more than a desire for nice surroundings and,&apos; imaginary ease.  It is a hard life, if a jolly one.Having uttered a warning, we pass quicklJ to encouragement.    No opportunity offers J healthier, happier return to civil and Quickly life than cultivation of the soil Please. and none is of more value to thi future of the country. The result! of hard working and patience and ingenuity ail visible. Fruition can be watched. The conl pleted thing can be seen. That after all is[ great help to toil. It is not here, as in so man! industrial occupations, the mechanical productiof of one stage in manufacture. So if only for thj joy of the vocation, every facility should given and that quickly to the soldier or sailol who feels the call to the land. There is anothef reason : They who really need this life will get i somehow. Delay and excessive restrictions this country will turn them looking at othel lands. We cannot afford to lose the husbandmen

The size of the pages will be increased andthe number of them will be maintained at a uniform sixteen, monthly. It is intended, too, now that the paper restrictions are relaxing, to effect some improvement in appearance. And now comes the small necessary evil without which great good is seldom accomplished. The price will be twopence. The support which has been given to the Gazette in the past ratines the belief that this increased price will be accepted with proper stoicism. Having said that, it only remains to add that there is every intention to turn that stoicism into approval.. We want to make the Gazette &quot; worth the money &quot; and more for the ex-service man and his dependants. Present readers can assist by using and quoting it more and more, and by telling others interested to do likewise.Ith hovTRADES FOR THE DISABLED.By Major R. Mitchell, C.B.E.Director 0/ Training, Ministry of Pensions.^rlINow that the training of the disabled man passed its experimental stage, it is possible Indicate with some degree of accuracy the occupations which are particularly suited I he different disabilities. The most difficult J been the one-armed man; and the number , &quot;occupations in which his training can be Fu mpted with a fair prospect of success are Pni sssarily somewhat limited. Good results have, Rp, ever, been observed in. the following :  ! ibstation Switch Board Surveying ts Work Commercial WorkBook-keeping Commercial Travellership Telephone   Exchange Operatorsand certain forms of Agricultural work. 1    [en suffering from leg amputations are not so pusly handicapped in their choice of a new ng, and a selection of suitable trades is not leu It to find.  At present the Diamond Cutting Polishing Classes at Brighton are reserved hese men, and their progress in this industry, :h is practically new to Great Britain, is jnishiDg.  About 500 men are already at work, as soon as the new factories are completed e will be accommodation for over 2,000. here are also: J go( wholesale Tailoring s ai xtile Trade .     3rich Polishing I   &apos; aughtsmanshipsuitable to those who are not able to engage in heavy occupations and require lighter indoor work. This category would include men who are suffering from Heart Trouble, Chronic Bheu-matism, Sciatica, &amp;c. Dental Mechanics is also an attractive subject for such men, but delicacy of touch and some mechanical aptitude are necessary. Where specialised machinery and tools are used, the Furniture trade brings employment within the reach of those whose strength is not equal to work which involves much physical strain.Men with bodily injuries but able to use both legs and arms may select from the many processes of :-rs&apos; soi jo tl esulcoi: 11 is[ maq ictilH tIdBuildingEngineering and Electrical Engineering TradesOptical and Surgical In-instrument-makingFittingBrass Finishing Moulding Pattern-making Coppersmithingnd-sewn Boot-making -Hid Kepairing (where sailSimputation is below LOthihe knee) get ltam processes of En-ng lineering florinothrCabinet-makingBrush-makingJewelleryWatch and Clock Jobbing Certain processes of Printing Commercial work Musical Instrument-makingTurning- Certain branches of Aircraft Manufacture can be safely attempted. Printing and Kindred Trades require good intelligence and ad apt-ability, and, for some processes, sound eyesight and freedom of movement generally are necessary.For Shell Shock, Gas Poisoning, Neurasthenic, Tubercular and Chest complaints, most indoor occupations are unsuitable, and bench and machine work should be particularly avoided. Fitting employment, however, can be found out of doors, and a choice can be made of the following : 3melPen ^0 ^e man wno kas ^os^ a um^ an(^ a^s0AgricultureHorticultureForestryEstate CarpentryPoultry-keepingBee-keeping.
Farming requires fairly robust health, and the strain of working out of doors in all weathers is severe. The use of Motor Tractors for farm work is increasing; and advantage may well be taken of training for this industry, which will offer steady employment. Men who cannot do a full day&apos;s work in the open.may be offered training in the manufacture of Oane and Willow Furniture. Basket-making and Brush-making are good occupations for those whose health is below the normal.For men suffering from Deafness training is provided in Lip-reading, but a change of occupa-tion will only be necessary from those trades where sound-warning of danger or frequent aural directions are required.The above will serve as a guide in recommend-ing suitable training and employment for the general cases of the disabled. There will, of course, be local industries where the conditions of work have been specially adapted to meet the needs of the disabled men of the district. But such cases are not numerous, and the foregoing suggestions are intended to meet the wider needs. . This article, of course, deals only with those disabled men who are able to face the strain of industrial competition. There remains a large number of seriously disabled who will need medical treatment for some considerable time, and who will be able to attempt only the lightest work. The forms of employment suitable to this class of case can be made the subject of another article later.Awards of disability, retired pay and gratuities to retired and demobilised officers and nurses, and pensions to the relatives of deceased officers are now dealt with from New North Street, Theobald&apos;s Eoad, W.0.1.In order to assist the Local War Pensions Committees and sub-Committees in selecting, for appointment as Secretary or Assistant Secretary, a qualified officer, non-commissioned officer, or man who has served in the war,. a course of training has been arranged by the Minister of Pensions which can be attended by a candidate if he has the necessary educational qualifications or past experience likely to make him an efficient Secretary.The training will be given partly at the Ministry and partly at a Local War Pensions Committee, and will b$ followed by an examination on the Eegulations and pro-cedure.The Special Grants Committee&apos;s Eegulations for Officers have been extended. The Committee is prepared to con-sider applications from married disabled officers for sup-supplementary allowances in respect of their children, if there are circumstances which would justify special treatment, notwithstanding that their disability has been assessed at less than 50 per cent.Applications, which should give the grounds on which an allowance is claimed, should be forwarded to: The Secretary, Special Grants Committee (Officers&apos; Branch), Ministry of Pensions, MillbanhHov.se, Westminster, S.W. 1.From Overseas.australia.Out of 412,066 enlistments provision has be made up to April, 1918, for the dependants 52,536 deceased soldiers.   To the same da 25,345 applications  have been  received positions found for 20,970.   Of the men so placed 37 per cent, have been absorbed und &quot; general labour and miscellaneous&quot; ; 12 per ce under pastoral, agricultural and rural occupation 8 per cent, under engineering and metal worke, canada.The Bepatriation Committee at Ottawa concentrating on public works, railways shipbuilding, housing, land-settlement and ro making for the employment of returning soldie For housing the Dominion Government is putt up something like  5,000,000. To those going the land loans up to  500 will be made, payable eighty instalments and bearing interest at 5 cent.france.For acquisition and improvement of small ru holdings, soldiers and sailors, holders of St disablement pensions on account of wow received or illness contracted during the pres war can now borrow money at 1 per cent, intei&apos;11 with a reduction of 0 fr. 50 for a legitimate ch born after the conclusion of the loan, so t&quot; if two children are born no more interest need paid.

fA Motion Withdrawn.Some points of the Ministers reply in Parliament to following motion, which was eventually withdrawn :-I J1 That, in the opinion of this House, the pensions and Uituities now awarded to men ivho have served in Hisijesttfs Forces, or their dependants, and the allowances , mted to the wives and dependants of men serving in the Uces are inadequate in view of the services rendered by se men and the present cost of living, and&apos; ought to be reased; and the present Regulations governing the pay-fit of pensions, gratuities, and alloivances ought to be ended.&quot;Sir L. Worthington Evans said:-Let me first say, I am extremely grateful to the House athe way in which this motion has been handled. The p: sion, of course, in terms condemns the present scale as   lequate, and in one sense no scale could be devised ch would be adequate to recompense the men who have r in such great service to the State and who have suffered   0 doing. But this scale of pensions is not framed with e ew to bringing monetary compensation for those great iotic services rendered by the men ; but what it is framed This to give some compensation for the physical disability ch has resulted from the services rendered by these men, I want to emphasise the distinction that it is not a ard for their patriotic services, but it is a mere compensa-1, in part at least, for the physical damage which they e suffered.The question of adequacy is another question altogether. Regard to the men, on the question of the amount of blement, practically no two men are exactly alike, except , jre you get the loss of a limb, where you have a com-plely fixed scale, but as regards any other two men we die got to act upon the doctor&apos;s advice. If I had to age, or if the hon. Gentleman had to judge, without any ence from the doctors at all, we should be wrong. We Id very likely say : &quot; They look both of them equally bled, and we will give them both 30 per cent, or 50 per t.&quot;; but I can assure him that much more care is in than that. The medical board examines the man ^jmakes its report, and then the decision of the medical q &apos;d may be altered by someone who has never seen theII doner. That is a very startling proposition. I remem-&apos;&apos; 1 that when I first discovered that, I looked into itfully.Let me explain.  It is said to be necessary in order there should be uniformity in awarding pensions. With [eat number of doctors all over the country, examining a number of men, you may well find that one doctor Id take different views of what another doctor would was the same set of cases: and so, where there is an arance of difference, highly, skilled, highly trained -Jical officers at the centre in London do examine these ids, and in cases of necessity are entitled to alter them, if what is the result of the alteration ?  The result in tice has been that in the majority of cases these awards 2 been increased by reason of the re-examination in ion.   But supposing in a case it is decreased, does the r necessarily suffer a hardship ?  He does not, because I An go to his Local War Pensions Committee and say, y pension is inadequate &quot; and the Local War Pensions Jpmittee can refer him to a medical referee. If the medical i^jree says that the pension is inadequate, and instead of .g 40 per cent, it ought to be 60 per cent., then the Local I Pensions Committee is entitled immediately to make.advances to that man on the 60 per cent, basis instead of on the 40 percent, basis, and the reforee&apos;s judgment is taken pending a further examination by another medical board.f Let me take the question of tho mothers pension. A great many hon. Members referred to the inadequacy of the mother&apos;s pension. They said-and quite truly that great hardship &apos;arises where a son has gone to the war, perhaps during his apprenticeship, at a time when he had little or no money which could assist his mother, but with the hope and belief that in the future his mother would get some benefit for her sacrifice, and so forth, on his behalf. What are the facts ? There is a flat pension of 5s. payable to any mother who applies for it in respect of the loss of a son, but the question of apprentices is in a different posi-sion and I do not want to deal with their case in detail to-night. The other pension in excess of 5s, depends upon the dependence-that is to say, the mother can get up to 15s. a week provided she shows that she was dependent upon her son. Note what it means, and let the House con-sider whether it is reasonable or adequate 1 The amount the mother receives from her son must always depend upon whether or not he is in work, and as to whether or- not he is having other calls upon him to prevent that contribu-tion to his mother&apos;s household. When he marries and goes forth into the world, it may be that he continues to make some allowance to his mother; but in the majority of cases that man goes forth and, having a wife and home to maintain, and, may be, children, there is very little or has been in the past, at any rate very little left out of his wages to contribute to his mother&apos;s household. What does it mean? Instead of receiving some precarious contri-bution of the son, that contribution is turned into a per-manent State pension for the rest of the mother&apos;s life.f Another case was given by my hon. Friend, that of a man suffering from tuberculosis. The man had gone into the Army, and the question was one that is known as a question of entitlement whether the man&apos;s disability was due to his military service or aggravated by it. This. ques-tion of entitlement to a pension is one of the most difficult questions with which we have to deal. Upon it depends not merely the amount of the pension, but whether the man is to have a pension at all. He may have a gratuity in various cases, but whether he is to have a pension at all is another point. If a man is refused a pension on the ground that he is not entitled to it he can appeal to what is practi-cally an independent tribunal. These tribunals are just as independent of being influenced by the Ministry of Pensions as if they were, in fact, set up by Act of Parliament. &apos; There are nine of these tribunals sitting now, and another will be sitting after Easter, and any man whose pension has been disallowed on the grounds I have stated is entitled to go before that tribunal, which perambulates the country and goes wherever it is required. It consists of one lawyer, a discharged sailor, a discharged soldier, and a medical assessor, and the decision of that tribunal is accepted by me as to whether a man is or is not entitled to a pension. That is not only a better security for the man than the so-called statutory right, but it is infinitely quicker.If There are several other points. The question of widows&apos; pensions was raised by. quite a number of hon. Members. I would like to say that not enough stress has been laid upon the fact that a widow can claim an alterna-tive pension if her husband was earning 27s. 6d. a week or more. The. present position is, in the case of the widow of a man who was earning  5 before the War, she need not take her 16s. 6d., even though she has no children, but she can take 50s. a week, which is the amount for her alternative pension.  I have no reason to believe that any
difficulty is put in the way of getting this pension, but there are not enough of them granted. I believe the present number is about 15,000 for widows out of 185,000 widows.rv   &quot;-&quot;-VJf;*J I think that the principle of the alternative pension is a good one we are agreed upon that and if there is tp be an alternative pension we have to take some period, pre-war, in order to ascertain what was the man&apos;s position in life. The year 1913 was not taken out of any desire to reduce it, and I do not think that the wages were lower in 1913 than in 1912 or 1911. I am hard at work on the Warrant hon. Members may call it tinkering trying to find places where it really wants what I call strengthening and supporting.   Since January  2,100,000 has gone on personal.Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice Craig, M.A., M.D., F.B.C.P., has been appointed Honorary Con-sultant for Neurological and Shell Shock cases to the Ministry of Pensions. Lieutenant-Colonel Craig, during the war, has acted as Assistant Consultant to the &quot;War Office in this class of case, and, in addition, has been Physician to the special hospitals for officers which were in-augurated by Lord Knutsford.The King has approved the appointment of Vice-Admiral Sir Herbert King Hall, K.C.B., C.V.O., D.8.O.-, as a Trustee of the King&apos;s Fund for the Disabled.The resignation of Ccionel F.

In regard to artificial limbs, officers have bee put on the same footing as men; they are entitled to second, limb, and to have their artificial limb maintains Thus about twelve strengthenings of the Warrant hai been put in practice during the last three months at a co of between  2,000,000 and  3,000,000.FOR NECESSARY ACTION.The Prime Ministers Letter to Employers.10, Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W.1, Gentlemen, Active hostilities have ceased and indust must now adjust itself to normal conditions. The ckiu of officers and men who have been disabled in the nation service merit full and generous consideration at the ban of the State, and provision is already being made for the support in the form of pensions and other allowance But just as the disabled man went forth to battle to figl for his country&apos;s cause he desires now to resume his plai in the ranks of industry and to make his contribution i building up a better Britain. The State will provii industrial training to fit a man for work if he cannot resuu his old vocation, but the first step is obviously I employers of labour, wherever possible, to reinstate the old workmen and to use their services for their own ai the country&apos;s good in employment suitable to their strenjl and capacity.A great overhauling is necessary.

There is no more serious waste tk unemployment, and I am confident that British indusii; by reorganising its ranks and speeding up and inteus fying production, can provide the opportunity for hone labour and remuneration for every workman in the land.I have every confidence in appealing to the workpeopl of our country to co-operate with employers in fini; employment for their kinsmen who crowned our arms \i success, and so kept our shores inviolate from the ravage of a desperate and brutal foe.Employers and employed throughout the land will sem their country right well by co-operating with local adviaj committees which are at work in all areas so as to see 41 every discharged soldier is back at work as soon as posslIt is superfluous to say that, notwithstanding the pens paid to a disabled man, no employer will desire to payte than the full value of his labour, but the Home Officefc arranged to relieve employers of any increased liability under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act which this rnai employment may involve.My final word&apos; is to say to everyone concerned in t! welfare of the State and the wellbeing of the people ft there is no more urgent problem than to give our disalfc soldiers the sense of just and honourable treatment, and&apos; re-establish our industrial life on the basis of the friend co-operation and goodwill.

whilst at the same time the path of the Local War Pensions Committee will be smoothed.The Committees will look to their regional headquarters for guidance and instruction. They will not feel that rather disheartening sense of distance and detachment from the centre which has hitherto prevailed, because they will, so to speak, have the Ministry at their own doors. It is a very practical truth that five minutes con-versation with a responsible representative of the Ministry is of much more value than voluminous correspondence &quot;spread over many days. The regional Office will supply this short cut. By decentralisation it will be possible to do things more quickly, and to give to the particular circumstances and needs of localities that special attention which they deserve and, indeed, must have, if pension administration is to be above criticism and reproach. A little time must elapse before the new regional system is in working order. When it has been given a fair start Local Committees can combine to help it forward in the assurance that it will emphasise their own efficiency and contribute to the welfare of disabled men.A monthly Official Journal for all interested in War Pensions; in those who have earned them; and in their&apos; widows and children also.No. 25.MAY, 1919.ONE PENNY.The Editor will be pleased to &quot;consider contributions and will return them if unsuitable-Communications for the Editor should be addressedMillbank House, Westminster, London, S.

Stationery Office (address ason backpage), or through any Bookseller or Newsagent.THE FRIENDSHIP OF SERVICE.The cynic has it that obligations breed hate : that if you do a man a service you make him your enemy. A poor doctrine. But*then cynicism is a poor doctrine : and those who are administering pensions . and supplementing the cash with personal service and sympathy have no place for such a creed. The fighting man is a poor subject for cynicism. Furthermore, like most cynicisms, this one is only true in part. For the poor in spirit, for the falsely-proud, an obligation may leave a sense of enmity.   The little man enviesthe power that can render the service: the inflated man fears for his dignity in accepting it.Now in the true test it is all quite different. There is joy in giving and joy in receiving. Just as friendships may demand service, so service can create friendships: not the for-what-we-are-going-to-receive sentiment, but a friendship called forth and based upon a recognition of the qualities that induced the service. Gratitude is not a bad basis for friendship : and in these days when &quot; rights &quot; is the universal battle-cry it is a sentiment that might easily be cultivated more. There is nothing derogatory in gratitude.The other party to the proposition, he who renders the service, will certainly feel his share of the friendship if only the services are properly received. His interest is aroused: and interest is not a bad basis for friendship either. He can do a lot to encourage this friendship in. the one whom he befriends if he go carefully.Of course there are horrible folk who make the slightest service a patronage. With them it is one for the receiver and two for the giver every time. They condescend; and they thank God rather like the Pharisee of old. To them comes ridicule or servile lip-service of thanks. . But they are permanently relegated to the C3-dom of intercourse with their fellows. They carry a label of danger in their smile, and a yellow quarantine flag on their manner. They are out-side the idea and always will be.But where the service is deserved, and willingly given, it is equal shares. Both benefit. Both experience a friendliness. Proper gratitude on the one side and kindly interest on the other draw folk together. Each feels in the other a contact with another circle, a link with that great mass-sentiment, commonly called humanity, which has been so definitely vindicated in this war by the cohesion of so many nations against its violation by Germany. Both are the better for an additional infusion of this sentiment: and looking to the author of it they feel friendly. Besult friendship.True, this is not usually a conscious process. But given the proper circumstances it can be very real: the result very lasting. So we can all take comfort. Whether we have to give or to receive, to render or accept a service, we are the gainers. Never mind the sovereign lent (indefi-nitely) : never mind the brusqueness of the cur-mudgeon : nor the grumbles instead of thanks: nor the tilted chin of condescension. They react on the offenders. Occasions are mapy when the r3ceiver appreciates the giver, and the giver returns the appreciation. The widening, edu-cating friendship that comes out of this is worth many disappointments and rebuffs.
IN PARLIAMENT.Disabled Officers (Children.)Mr. Pennefather asked the Pensions Minister if he has considered the question of allowances for the children of disabled officers whose disability is 50 per cent, or lower; and if so, can he make any statement on the subject ?Sir Laming Worthington-Evans : My hon. Friend pre-sumably refers to the Regulation of the Special Grants Committee which in special cases permits the grant of supplementary allowances to a married disabled officer with children where the disability is assessed at more than 50 per cent. I am glad to be able to state that I have now approved an amendment of the Regulation which will permit the grant to be made in proper cases, whatever the degree of disability. /Soldiers (Sanatorium Treatment.)Sir Kingsley Wood asked the Pensions Minister whether a reduction of 20 per cent, is made from the pensions of soldiers whilst inmates of a sanatorium, as also the sum of 7s. a week, towards the cost of their treatment; and whether any reduction is also made in respect of national insurance benefit ?The Minister of Pensions (Sir Laming Worthington-Evans) : A disabled soldier under treatment in a sanatorium or other institution for an attributable disability receives an allowance at the maximum rate of pension, from which a deduction of 7s. a week is made, not for the cost of treat-ment, but for maintenance. Tho bonus of 20 per cent, is not added to the man&apos;s allowance, the reason of the exclu-sion of this class of case from the grant of bonus being that the deduction made for maintenance is so small as largely to relieve the man of the burden of the high cost of living which the bonus is designed to meet. With regard to the insurance benefit, I would refer my hon. Friend to Section 1 of the National Insurance (Part I, Amendment Act), 1917.Appeals against Assessment.Major Barker asked the Pensions Minister if disabled soldiers whose appeal against the assessment of their pension award is upheld by the medical referee, and who receive the difference of ,pay from the local pensions com-mittee, are nevertheless compelled to refund the difference if the opinion of the medical referee is not upheld by the subsequent board; and if he will reconsider the desirability of this method of procedure ?Sir J. Craig: In the circumstances stated in the first part of the question, advances paid by the local committee are recovered by small instalments from future payments of pensions. Committees are instructed to warn applicants on the first issue of advances that this recovery will take place if the opinion of the medical referee is not upheld by the medical board. If the advances were not recovered in these cases, men might be encouraged to put forward frivolous appeals in the hope of finding a medical referee more inclined to take a serious view of their disabilities than the medical board and thus obtaining a temporary increase of pension in the interval before re-examination.Soldiers&apos; Funeral Expenses.Sir Kingsley Wood asked the Pensions Minister whether he is now in a position to state whether any arrangements have been made which will obviate the necessity of,appli-cations to the Poor Law authorities in respect of soldiers&apos; funeral expenses ?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions(Sir James Craig): I am glad to be able to announce an increase in the maximum funeral grant for discharged dis-abled men from  &amp; to  1 10s. The increase is being immediately notified to the local war&apos; pensions committees.Old Soldiers.Captain Brackenbury asked the Pensions Minister whether he is aware that old soldiers discharged before the War consider it a hardship that they should not receive such increase in their pensions as is given to soldiers dis-charged since the beginning of the war in order to cover the higher cost of living; and, if so, whether he will take steps to remove this injustice?The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions (Sir James Craig): So far as has been found practicable  that is, in the case of total incapacity and of certain specific disabilities-the pensions of previous wars have been raised to the level of those of the present war, and where so raised the war bonus of 20 per cent, now in payment in respect of present war pensions is also added. It is not in contemplation to extend the bonus to other classes of pension.Remarried Mothers.Mr. Briggs asked the Pensions Minister whether the mother of a soldier who marries or remarries during his service is entitled to a pension; if not, under what article of the Warrant is a pension refused in such circumstances; and, if pensions to remarried mothers are refused on grounds of other than ineligibility under the Royal Warrant, whether he will state the nature of those grounds ? &apos;Sir J. Craig: Pension is refused in the circumstances stated on the ground that on marriage or remarriage a mother ceases to be dependent on her son. The intention of the&apos; Warrant on this point is faultily expressed in Article 21 (4) and an opportunity will be taken when the Warrant is revised to make the position clearer. I may add that a pension under Article 21 (1) (6) may be granted to a mother so marrying or remarrying if at any time she becomes incapable of self-support from age or infirmity, and is in need.Soldiers&apos; Graves.Mr. Gilbert asked if the Graves Registration Committee can supply photographs, when obtainable, of the graves of soldiers who are buried in France or Belgium; if such photographs are supplied free; and, if not, what is the charge for the same, and to whom should the relatives apply if they desire them ?Captain Guest: The Directorate of Graves Registration and.Inquiries is supplying photographs of graves free of charge to relatives on request as quickly as circumstances permit. Photographs of registered identified graves have been supplied since June, 1915, funds for the purpose being generously supplied by the Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Since that date 98,300 photographs have been sent out. All applications for photographs should be addressed to the Directorate of Graves Registration and Inquiries, Winchester House, St. James&apos;s Square, London, S.W.I. Relatives are informed when notification of death is sent that photographs will be supplied if such application is made.Blinded Service Men (Training).Lieutenant-Colonel Hilder asked the Pensions Minister what arrangements are being made for the proper provision for the needs and training of the blinded sailors and soldiers; and whether, in view of the exceptional nature of their affliction, the whole cost is borne by the State, whether in public or private institutions, or is dependent upon private subscriptions ?Sir James Craig: A blinded sailor or soldier is cared for
and trained at St. Dunstan&apos;s or at Newington House, Edin-burgh. These institutions are maintained out of private funds The State pays to the man pension at the highest rate with allowances for his wife and family, without any deduction for the cost of maintenance. On leaving St. Dunstan&apos;s, or Newington House, he receives, in addi-tion, an attendance allowance up to 20s. a week. No deduc-tion is made on account of earnings, and in most cases the training given to the men enables them to secure substantial earnings.Alternative Pensions.Mr. F. C. Thomson asked the Pensions Minister whether, seeing that the widows of officers ikilled during the War were not informed individually or by any direct means of the system of granting alternative pensions, and in many cases are still ignorant of it, he can see his way to alter the rule that alternative pensions can only be granted from the date of application therefor ?Sir L. Worthington-Evans: If the application for alter-native pension is made within three months of the notifica-tion of the award of the fiat-rate pension, payment is made with arrears from the day following the. death. In other cases, payment is made as, from the date of application. (In reply to further questions.) I want the widow who is entitled to an alternative pension to have an alternative pension, and I will see whether it is possible to give each widow some direct and personal notice of her rights.Higher Education (Service Men).Mr. Robert Young asked the President of the Board of Education how many applications have been received by the Board of Education since the date of the Armistice, from officers and men, and ex-officers and men, for financial assistance to enable them to pursue courses of higher education at universities and similar institutions; what is the number of individuals to whom financial assistance has been given; and what is the average amount of such assistance given in each case ?The President of the Board of Education (Mr. Fisher): At present the Board have dealt only with applicants in urgent need of financial assistance under special regula-tions, and interim Grants have been made to these students pending. settlement of their applications for a final award. The total number of applications for interim Grant received up to the 5th hist, is 1,623, and of these 1,149 have been approved. The average amount of assistance granted per applicant is  28 per term. The amount of the interim Grant does not indicate or prejudice the amount of the final award, which I will expedite as much as possible.Royal Naval Reserve (Engineer Officers).Major Henderson asked the Secretary to the Admiralty whether any decision has now been arrived at in regard to the payment of gratuity to Royal Naval Reserve engineer officers who signed on under T 124 Z Articles ?Dr. Macnamara : Yes, Sir. They will receive a discharge gratuity under the same conditions and at the same rates as General Service Executive Royal Naval Reserve officers of relative rank. Thus an engineer lieutenant, Royal Naval Reserve, will receive  74 for his first year&apos;s service and  37 for each subsequent year or part of ,a year. The gratuity will be paid on application as soon as possible after an officer is signed off his agreement.Artificial Limbs (Officers).Major Cohen asked the Pensions Minister whether he is now able to announce any relaxation of the rule which compels retired officers to repair and renew their artificial limbs at their own expense ?The Minister of Pensions - (Sir Laming Worthington-Evans) : The Regulations at present in force as to the supply, repair and renewal of artificial limbs for dischargedsailors and soldiers will be extended to retired officers, with the result that every retired officer will&apos;be supplied with the artificial limb which he requires, and also with an additional limb as soon as the stump is ready to receive it, and the supply is available, without charge. The Ministry will also undertake all repairs and renewals of limbs.Tuberculosis (Clerical Workers).Sir Arthur Shirley Benn asked the Pensions Minister if, when granting a disablement pension to a soldier accustomed to clerical work who contracted tuberculosis on active service, the pension is sufficiently high to ensure his not having to continue earning his livelihood by clerical work.Sir L. Worthington-Evans: A disablement pension is granted with reference only to the degree of physical disable-ment, and without regard to occupation. But if the nature of the disablement is such that it would be dangerous to the man&apos;s health if he were to resume his pre-war occupation he may be trained for a new one. During training he receives allowances equivalent to the highest rate of pension or, if more favourable to him, allowances based on his pre-war earnings. If, when trained, he finds his earning capacity lessened to such an extent that his disablement pension does not provide adequate compensation, he may be eligible for an alternative pension.Destitute Younger Children.Mr. Thomas Griffiths asked the Pensions Minister whether in the case of a pension being awarded to a father in respect of the death of his two soldier sons, and the father himself dying, there is any provision for continuing the pension to two younger children who are left destitute and would have been maintained by the two soldiers had they lived ; and, if not, whether steps will be taken to secure the continuance of the pension in such circumstances ?Sir L. Worthington-Evans : In the circumstances stated, if the pension was granted to the father in respect of previous dependence, a portion of it may, on the father&apos;s death, be awarded under Article 22 of the Royal Warrant to the younger children for their maintenance up to the age of 16. And even without previous dependence it may be possible for the Special Grants Committee to assist under their regulations. Cases of this nature must be decided on their individual merits.Free Passages.The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lieutenant-Colonel Amery), in reply to several questions: His Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the following decision: Ex-Service men, who are accepted as approved settlers under any settlement scheme of the Oversea Governments, or can show that they have assured employment awaiting them and are otherwise acceptable to the authorities of the Dominion to which they wish to proceed, will be given free passages for themselves and their dependants to the nearest convenient port to their destination overseas. The same privilege, subject, of course, to the same limitations, will be extended to ex-Service women, i.e., women who have served in one of the recognized women&apos;s service corps, including for this purpose the Land Army.I should add that, in view of the prior claims of their own ex-Service men for resettlement, the Dominion Governments are not likely to be in a position to welcome any British ex-Service settlers before the end of the present year, even if shipping should be available for the purpose before that date. Applications from ex-Service men and women will, however, be received for a year from 31st December next, or from the date of release from service, or if necessary, for such period as may be found requisite as to afford them ample time in which to make their choice between the opportunities for employment and settlement available in the United Kingdom and those available in the British Dominions overseas.

Circular 158.-Out-of-Work Donation.DISCHARGED AND DEMOBILISED MEN.(1) All soldiers, sailors and airmen below commissioned rank who have given actual service during the present war, and who have been paid out. of public funds, are entitled to&quot; an Out-of-Work Donation Policy (H.M, Forces).&quot; Discharged or demobilised men, including disabled men, can obtain this policy on application to the local Employment Exchange. Out of-Work Donation is payable on the policy to a man if is ho capable of work, but, in fact, unemployed and unable to obtrtin suitable employment. Disabled men in receipt of pension are entitled, if capable of work and unable to obtain suitable employment, to receivo Out-of-Work Donation in full, but Out-of-Work Donation is not payable concurrently with the allowances authorised under Article 0 of the Royal Warrant (or Instruction 3-4 of the Instructions on Treatment and Training) in tho following cases :-(a) To discharged mon who are receiving treatment (or awaiting admission to a hospital for the purpose of treatment) and are being paid the full disablement allowances (in lieu of pension) on the basis of a medical certificate that they are incapable of work. (6) To disabled men undergoing a course of training and in receipt of allowances, such men being doomed to be, for the purpose of Out-of-Work Donation, in employment. Where possible, Local Committees should make arrangements with the Employment Exchanges to ensure that the Out-of-Work Donation and treat-ment or training allowances are not paid concurrently.(2) If a discharged disabled man discontinues a course of training without reasonable cause, and claims Donation, the claim will not be admitted by the Employment Exchange or Branch Employment Office, but will be referred to a Court of Referees (under Part II of the National Insurance Act, 1911) for adjudication on the question whether Out-of-Work Donation should bo with-held from him. If any case in which a man so discontinues his training without reasonable cause comes to the knowledge of a Local Committee, they should at once communicate particulars to the Manager of the Employment Exchange.(3) If a discharged man attends at an Exchange and it is not possible because of his disability to offer him work in his ordinary occupation, the Exchange Manager will, if it appears to be a case where treatment or training would be beneficial, submit the case to &quot;the Local War Pensions Committee to consider whether treatment or training should be offered.If treatment with full allowances is offered by tho Local Committee and the man accepts it, the case should be notilied to the Employment Exchange, when Out-of-Work Donation will cease to bo payable as from tho date that allowances are paid by the Local Committee.If tho man is found eligible for training by the Committee and the man [accepts it, the case should be similarly notilied to the Employment Exchange, and Donations will cease as from the date of the commencement of training. If the man declines training, Donation will bo suspended and the case referred to the Court of Referees for adjudication on the claim for Donation. If the Court of Referees decide that the man should accept the trainingithe claim for Donation will not be allowed. If, however, the Court of Referees consider that it is not a case for training, and that Donation should be allowed, the Ministry of Labour will, if thoy think proper, appeal from the decision to the Umpire, and will give the Local Pensions Committee notice of the hearing in lorder that, if they so desire, they may attend and present their views.Childless Wives and Dependants.(4) An Out-of-Work Donation Policy (Civilian Workers) may be claimed by my woman over 15 years of age, who, if over 16 years of age, was an employed contributor under the National Health Insurance Scheme at least three months prior to tho 20th November, 191S, or who, if between 15 and 10 years Df age, can show that she entered employment at least three months prior to that date, and Out-of-Work Donation is paid on tho policy by Empdoymonfc Exchanges to any woman who, being capable of work, is not, in fact, employed and is unable.to obtain suitable employment.

Circular 159.-Demobilised Men (Class Z).Mote. This Circular is in substitution for the last paragraph of Circular 148 and for the neostyled Circular distributed to Local Committees on February 7th, ivhich are hereby cancelled.A.-During Period of Twenty-eight Days&apos; Furlough. (2) Army Pay and Allowancei.-1\\a soldier is entitled to pay and rationpwn Intsex- illowance for the period of the twenty-eight days&apos; furlough.jn :f On leaving the Dispersal Station he is given an advance of .42 and the I emainder is remitted to him by post in threo weekly instalments from his ate. &apos;ay Office. Complaints have been received that delay occurs in the payment if Army Pay and Allowances. In all such cases whore a man applies to i Local Committee, thoy should direct the man.to communicate, or may hemselves communicate, with the Regimental Paymaster, and, in the eventJver, theHod if failure to obtain satisfaction, with, the War oitice, marking the fettere inonAccounts 2 (Complaints Branch).&quot;(3) Medical Treatment.-Any man, whether or not he claimed to be impaired lOliefore leaving the Dispersal Centre, is entitled to medical treatment free of harge at the nearest military hospital at which accommodation is available ar him, and an officer of the Local Committee may help the man by com-nmnicating, over tho telephone, with a responsible officer of the hospital, and arranging for his admission. At the same time, the Commandants of the Military hospitals are ompowored to issuo travelling warrants to the men, and the issuo of such a warrant should he requostcd if the man applies to the&apos; Local Committee. If ho resides more than two miles from a military hospital or accommodation is not available, he may apply to a civilian medical prac-titioner, whose fees will be paid by tho War Office. Doctors so employed should prefer their claims on A.F.O. 1007, which may bo obtained from, and when completed should bo forwarded to, tho Deputy Director of Medical Services at tho Headquarters of the Command in which the soldier is temporarily residing, The soldier must produce to the doctor ids Protection Certificate and must inform Records Office that ho is obtaining treatment so that, if necossary, airaiigpments maybe niado for his removal to a military hospital as soon as possible.(-1) Pension Claims,-A Class Z. man, who during his furlough applies to the Local Committee, and claims pension, on the ground of disability due to sorvice, should bo asked whether or not ho claimed to be impaired before he left the Army (sen para. 1 of Circular 148). If he did make such a claim on Form Z 22 the Local Committee should communicate with tho Ministry of Pensions (&quot;Z&quot; Branch), Burton Court, King&apos;s Road, London, S.W, 3, and ascertain whether tho claim has been admitted ; if tho claim has been admitted, the pension or gratuity will be awarded after the twenty-eighth day of furlough.(5) Xf the man did not claim to be impaired before leaving the Dispersal Centro,&apos;it is open to the Local Committee to consider the case for pension or gratuity under Articlo 9 of the Royal Warrant. (For procedure see Cir-cular 143.) At the same time, tho Local Committeo are authorised to apply to tho Record Office of tho man&apos;s late Unit for a summary of his medical his-tory during his military service, which should bo shown to the Medical Referee, if received in good timo, to enable him the better to givo tho necessary certificate. The papers in the case may bo forwarded to the Ministry of Pensions (Awards Branch), Burton Court, King&apos;s Road, London, S.W. 3, if completed boforo the termination of furlough, so that the case can be dealt with at once.(6) It will be seen from tho above that the man on furlough receives full Army pay and allowances and is entitled to medical treatment at the expense of tho Military Authorities. Whatever his disablement, therefore, he cannot during this period be provided with advances or medical treatment out of Ministry Funds.B.-After the Conclusion of Furlough.(V) Pension Claims.-A man is entitled at any time after the conclusion of furlough, and notwithstanding that he did not claim impairment on de-mobilisation, to represent that he is suffering from a disability caused by his war service, and to make a claim for a pension under Article 9. If he does so, tho procedure should be, as before stated, in accordance with Circular 143.(S) A demobilised man claiming pension should be asked whether or not he claimed impairment on demobilisation. If he did, the &quot; Article 9 &quot; procedure should not be followed but the Local Committee should communicate with &quot; Z &quot; Branch, as in para. 4 above.(9) Recoverable Advances.-!!, on being referred to the Medical Referee, tho man who claims under Article 9 is cortilled by him to be suffering from a dis-ability duo to or aggravated by his war service, the Local Committee is authorised to make him a recoverable advance of pension weekly, at the rate appropriate to the finding of the Medical Referee (with proportionate children&apos;s allowances), until the Ministry have decided whether his disable-ment was due to, or not due to, his war service, and as to what amount of pension or gratuity is due.(10) Similarly, a man who claimed impairment on demobilisation, but to whom the decision of the Ministry has not been communicated prior to the expiration of furlough, may be given recoverable advances on the certificate of the Medical Refereo pending the result of communication with &quot;Z&quot; Branch (see para. 8).(11) Medical Treatment.-lt a Medical Referee certifies that a demobilised man needs treatment on account of a disability due to or aggravated by military service, the Local Committee is authorised, as from the expiration of furlough, to obtain such treatment for him (whether he claimed impairment at the time of demobilisation or subsequently under Article 9), and to pay allowances in accordance with Article 0 of the Royal Warrant. * (12) Local Committees are reminded that, at the conclusion of furlough, any demobilised man, if he was previously an insured person, or if on de-mobilisation he lias made a claim of impairment which has been admitted by tho Ministry, becomes entitled under tho National Health Insurance Acts to sanatorium benefit for tuberculosis and to medical treatment at home for any ailment. To obtain theto benefits he should communicate with the Insur-anco Committee and produce to them the medical card already issued to him or procure a medical card from them.(13) A demobilised man, whose claim to impairment has been admitted, is entitled to treatment (with the usual allowances) for his impairing disability under the same regulations as an invalided man.C.-Class W. Reserve and Other Discharged Men. (14) The foregoing paragraphs, so far as regards the power of the Local Committee to make advances and to give medical treatment (with allowances), on the Medical Referee&apos;s certificate, apply to any other cases of discharged mon (e.g., men formerly in &quot;Class W &quot; Reseive) who claim disability, due to service under Article 9 of the Royal Warrant and whose claims have not previously been adjudicated. In &quot; Class W &quot; cases, it should be noted, dis-ability must be due to service given before transfer to the Reserves.D.-Assistance in Other Forms to Demobilised Men. ,(15) The Local Committees are only concerned with disabled men, or with men who appear to have a good claim to disablement pension and who may be temporarily assisted, to the extent above indicated, pending decision on their, claim.(10) Local Employment Exchanges, and the Local Advisory Committees attached to them, are the bodies constituted to deal with the re-settlement of labour, and any difficulties arising on the re-employment of demobilised men should be referred to tlieso authorities, or, where necessary, to the Demobili-sation and Re-settlement Committee of the Ministry of Labour Local War , Pension Committees are not empowered to deal with these cases
E.-DllMOUILISATION BY POST.(17) Opportunity is taken to notify Local Committees that a system of demobilisation by post has been introduced. The men so dealt with aro for tho most part those already in civil employment, o.g., men in Class W. of the Army Hoserve.(18) II tho men were not examined by a Medical Board (on A.F.B. 179 or A.F.B, 179a) before leaving the Colours, they will receive Form Z 22 with instructions as to its completion and return. Should a man claim to bo impaired ho will be required to take the form to the nearest Military Modical Officer or Hospital receiving military patients ; and if this involves a railway journey ho will be entitled to receive a return railway warrant, &amp;c, on apply-ing to his Officer in Charge of Records. In the event of bis applying to a. Local Committee, lie should be instructed accordingly.(19) Form Z 22 should not be completed by a Medical Iloferee.F.

If their condition does not warrant dischargo, they are demobilised but they do not fill in Form Z 22, having already made thoir statement as to disability on A.F.B. 179b. Any claim to pension is investigated in the ordinary course on this and the medical papers.March 23rd, 1919.   Circular 160.-Out-Patient Treatment pending Decision as to Attributability.- Sanction has been obtained from tho Lords Commissioners of n.M. Treasury to the extension of Art. 8 (3) of the Royal Warrant so as to include payment for tho cost of out-patient as well as in-paliont treatment during the currency of a temporary allowance issued under sub-section (1) of that Article. This sanction is subject to the condition that the cost of out-paiient. treatment cannot ho defrayed by the Local Committee beyond tho date on which intinia-tion is received that the invaliding disability has been hold to bo neither duo to nor aggravated by service in the present war, and the importance is emphasised of malting satisfactory arrangements to ensure tho fulfilment of this condition.March 25th, 1919.   Circular 161.-Training of Disabled Men and National Health Insurance.(1) With reference to Circular 83 relative to Insurance benefits during training the following decisions have been reached in regard to the position under tho National Insurance (Health) Acts of disabled mon who are under-going an approved course of training.(2) Under the National Insurance (Part T Amendment) Act, 1917, the rate of any sickness benefit to which an insured man under training may become entitled whilo receiving an allowance in lieu of pension is reduced by 5s. a week, and he is not entitled to any disablement benefit. This reducion of benefit: continues, subject to the conditions stated in tho next paragraph, so long as any maintenance allowance is payable, whether at the full rate or at a reduced rate consequent upon the payment of wages by the employer. During the period for which the man is subject to such reduction of benefit arrears of contributions do not accrue against hiip. A man undergoing training is not entitled to sickness benelit unless his Approved Society is satisfied that he is on medical grounds incapable of work.(3) When a man has since his discharge been in insurable employment ior 26 weeks and 26 contributions have been paid in respect of him ho is no longer subject to reduction of sickness benelit. Similarly he regains his right to disablement benefit when ho has since discharge been in insurable employ, ment for 104 weeks and 104 contributions have been paid, and his insurance then becomes subject to tho normal conditions.(4) While the man in training is in receipt of allowances only, no health insurance contributions are required to bo paid in respect of him. In the case, however, of training under an employer who pays the disabled man a wage in return for.services rendered, tho employer is required to pay health insurance contributions in the usual way, notwithstanding that the training allowances corresponding to tho highest degree of disablement are reduced by tho amount of the wage. The rate of contribution payable is 7(1. a week (in Ireland, 5 Jd.) of which 4d. a wegk (in Ireland, 3d.) may ordinarily be deducted&quot; from the wage.(5) Any further information which employors who are training disabled men may desire 1o have in regard to -tlio paymont of contributions will bo furnished on application to the appropriate National Health Commission at the address given below :-England. Buckingham Gate, London, S.W. 1.Scotland. 83, Princes Street, Edinburgh.Ireland. Pembroke House, Upper Mount Street, Dublin.Wales. City Hall, Cardiff.March 26th, 1919.   Circular 162. - Advice on Pension Matters.Certain newspapers are charging a fee for furnishing advice to discharged men, and to the wives and dependants of serving men, in respect of pensions, allowances and other matters connected therewith. Representations have been made-to the Minister that he should endeavour to effect the discon-tinuance of the charge, but this is a matter in which he has no power-to interfere. Moreover, he recognises that the columns in the press devoted to pension questions aiford useful publicity to the work of the Ministry, and he is desirous that the activities of the press in this direction should not be in any way discouraged.At the same titno he is anxious to ensure that all information on questions concerning pens&apos;ons, allowances, &amp;c, should be known to be available to the public free of charge, and it is suggested that suitable opportunities be taken by Local Committees to announce through the local press or otherwise that reliable information on all such matters will be gladly given free of charge to any person applying to the Office of a War Pensioh Committee.March 27th, 1919. Circular 163.  Part II. Regulations.S-.Tlie following important changes aro made in tho Part II. Regulations and in tlio Instructions relating thereto:-I. Regulations1 (l)(o),It has been decided that in calculating the present income of an applicant for a supplementary allowance under Regulation 7 (l)(o) tho further increase in State separation allowance conceded in November, 1918, should be dis-regarded, but tho October, 1918, increase and earlier increases should bo included.The following tabular statement sets out the scale of separation allowances for the wives and children under 14 of privates, Sc., as altered in October, 11)18 - 	Navy	Army and Royal Air ForceWife........ ,, and 1 child under 14 ,,    ,, 2 children ,,    ,,3 children ,,    ,, 4 children Motherless   children under 14	-  s. a. 11  0 19 8 26 0 29  6 31  6 2s. for each additional child For any child living singly, 10s.

Two or more children of tire same family living together, 10s. for first child and 7s. for each of others2.  Regulations 7 (1) (d).(a) This regulation as amended by Circular 120 and the circular letter of November 21st, 191S, will now read as follows :- &apos;&quot;(d) (i) Where it appears that a wife without children is not earning wages, an allowance shall be granted of 6s. 6d. a week.&quot; (ii) Where a dependant is physically unfit or unable for other reasons to obtain employment an allowance may be granted of one-half of the assessed dependence, but not exceeding for one dependant 6s. 6d. a week; for two dependants 9s. 6d. a week; fur three dependants 12s. a week, and for each additional dependant Is. 6d. a week.&quot;(b) For tho purposes of this Regulation unmarried wives in receipt of State separation allowance as Class B dependants, or irr receipt of the maximum special separation allowance under Regulation S (a), should bo treated in the same way as married wives, i.e., they should be dealt with under sub-section (i) of the Regulations as wives, and not under sub-section (ii) as dependants.. (C) It is particularly pointed out that the childless wife is entitled to the allowance of 6s. Gd. on the sole condition that she is not earning wages, and no other matter or consideration is to be taken into account. As there seems to be some misapprehension on this point it is requested that Local Com-mittees will take an early opportunity of explaining tho position clearly to all their Sub-Committees Casual earnings or earnings of small amount may for this purpose be disregarded.(d) When the husb nd is in receipt of family allowance, the wife is still entitled to the benefit of this Regulation.(e) Allowances to childless wives under this Regulation should be paid with effect from November 1st, 1918, provided that tho Local Committee are satis-fied that the applicant has been eligible since tlrat date, or from any later date on which she ceased to earn.N.B.-This is an exception to the general rule that giants and allowances under the. Part II. Regulations should irot be paid with effect earlier than the date of application, but. arises from the fact, tlrat the allowance was granted by H.M. Government from the above date tn all cases satisfying the condition.(f) For the purpose of Regulation 7 (1) (d) (i) a woman may be regarded as &quot; childless &quot; if she has no children in respect of whom she is drawing separa-tion allowance.(g) A woman receiving the Government out-of-work donation is not eligible under this Regulation.(h) The Declaration Form C.W. 1 which has been prepared for uso by appli-cants under Regulation 7 (1) (d) (i) should bo regarded as the &quot; case paper&quot; relating to the application,.and the applicant should irot be required to fill in a form S. 1 or other case paper unless assistance is also sought under another Regulation.3.  Regulation 13 (a).This Regulation has beerr amended, and will now read as follows :-&quot; (a) i. In the case of a serious illness of a wife, child or dependant of a sailor, soldier or airman where p&apos;cuniary need exists and financial asistance is not available from insurance or benefit society or other source, a grant not exceeding 5s. a week, but such grant shall not be continued for a longer period than two weeks except upon a medical certificate, and in no case for riiore than thirteen weeks. I&apos;provide always that the Spectal Grants Com-mittee may. on the recommendation of a Local Committee, increase the said sum of 5s. to a sum not exceeding 10*., and may eitend the period jor which such allowance is granted in any case where, owing to special circumstances, such increase or extension is necessary; and provided further that they may sanction a grant not exceeding  5 in respect of expanses arising out of serious illness, but not forming part of the ordinary expenses of an illness, sw as travelling expenses for upatient removed to a hospital lor treatment.&quot; ii. The provisions of this Regulation may be applied during the continuance of the war to a widow or child of a deceased sailor, soldier or airman.&quot;
of mdBfltbutAVOorepm; me the ing mdin art forthe lor,Note A.-The amendment consists of tho addition of the underlined bortion of the final paragraph. In submitting recommendations to tho jipecial Grants Committee undor this now provision. Local Committees iliould furnish a report showing (a) the amount of the lump sum grant ocommended, (b) particulars of the expenses in respect of which the grant 5 required, (c) tho circumstances in winch tho oxpensos in question were lecessary, and (d) that tho applicants financial position is such that tho xpnnses cannot bo met without tho aid of a grant. Local Committees re reminded that it is not competent for them to make lump sum grants nder this Regulation without the sanction of tho Special Grants Com. littee having previously been obtained, and further, that thoy have no owor to deal with any expenses arising out of sickness by making grants nder para. 53of the Part II Instructions as for an &quot;unspecified emergency.&quot; In connection with the foregoing, the attention of Local Committees is rawn to&apos;tho serious delays which frequently occur in tho settlement of pplieations to the Special Giants Committee for authority to extend the period of sickness grants, owing to protracted correspondence which might be voided if sufficient information were fur1 ished in tha Local Committeo&apos;s iginal report. With a view to reducing&quot; such correspondence to a minimum, is requested that in submitting these applications the following particulars iay bo given in all cases :-1. A medical certificate of recent idato showing the nature of the illness, and, if possible, its probable duration. If the illness is of a prolonged kind, the approximate date on which it began, and a full copy of Form S. 1 showing any assistance which has been granted under Part II. of the Regulations. 2. Particulars of any treatment being undergone or recommended. 3. If a grant of more than 5s. a week is desired, tho reasons for rocorn-mending a higher sum should be stated.Note B.-If the case is one of Tuberculosis and tho wife or dependant is insured person, the Local Committee hhould notify the Insurance Com-ittee before making more than a provisional grant under this Regulation, jid should only continue to make payments thoreunder if satisfied that the psurance Committee is unable to deal with the case. As the Local Com-jittee are no doubt aware, Insurance Committees have discretion in certain [ses of Tuberculosis to pay travelling expenses to an Institution and to lake grafts for the provision of extra nourishment. This instruction should also be taken to apply in Tuberculosis cases falling ider Regulation 13 (g) below.Note C-Where two or more members of a family are seriously ill at the line time, the maximum grant which Local Committees are empowered to :e under Regulation 13 (a) without reference to tho Special Grants Com-ttee is 5s. for each individual patient, but the grant should not exceed the tal additional expense involved if less than this maximum.Note D.-Local Committees fare asked to impress upon all their Sub-mmittees that Regulation 13 (a) does not (provide for grants to defray o expense of medical certificates which are required to be produced in incidence of entitlement under the Regulation, and further, that the services Medical Referees are not available for investigation into tho question of litloment in these cases. Tho reference to &quot; cases of sickness&quot; in para. 1 of Circular 87 is not intended to cover applications for emergency grants der this Regulation. Regulation 13 (g).This is an entirely new Regulation and will road as follows: &quot;A grant not exceeding 5s. a week to meet tho expenses of extra nourishment required in a case of illness which is not of a serious nature, and therefore cannot be dealt with by Sub-Section (ft) of this Regulation, e.g., in cases of incipient tuberculosis, anaemia, nervous debility, &amp;c, provided that a medical certificate is furnished to the effect that the extra nourishment is necessary to prevent the condition of the applicant from developing into that of a serious illness, and provided further that such grant shall not lie continued for a longer period than four weeks, except with the sanction of the Special Grants Committee.&apos;1 S&apos;ote.-In submitting recommendations under this Regulation it will be ;essary in every case to furnish a medical certilicate to the effect that i extra nourishment is necessary to prevent applicants condition from celoping into that of serious illness. Loosely worded or vague certificates t containing a delinite assurance on this point will not meet the require-nt of the Regulation, and will lead to delay.t is pointed out that this Regulation only applies to the wives, children i dependants of serving men and the grant is limited to 5s. a week. If s case is one in which it is probable that the grant will be needed for more m four weeks, application for the necessary extension should be made if ssiblo in time to enable the Special Grants Committee to give their decision Tore the four weeks have expired.&apos;ee also Note B above, with regard to tuberculosis cases falling within s Regulation.1 Regulation 13-General.t has been represented to the Minister that para. 9G of the Part II Instruc-ns, prohibiting the grant of assistance for the purpose of enabling relatives visit sick and wounded men in hospital, operates harshly in a certain numbers of cases where owing to the condition of the patient the relatives detained In the vicinity of the hospital for some days, and are put to extra lense, which their separation allowance and other income are inadequate meet.  These ases are found to fall into two distinct classes, viz. :-(a) When at the request of tho hospital authorities a relativo remains at or near the hospital because the condition of the man is-such that the presence of the relativo exercises a beneficial influenco which assists the treatment, and (6) Where a relative stays with the permission of the hospital authoritiesin a case where a man&apos;s condition remains critical for some days, he Special Grants Committee have decided that, whore either of the above ditions can be shown to exist, Local Committees may make grants under unspocilied emergency provisions to assist the relative in meeting the extra enses incurred, provided that those expenses are reasonable and the licant is not in a position to meet them without assistance, local Committees, however, are not empowered to make grants in these !s beyond the sum of  2 without obtaining the sanction of the special grants Committee, and it must bo understood that in no case will the grant be sanctioned in respect of the ordinary cost of the journey, e.g., railway fare, for which whore help is required provision is already mado under existing arrangements.The grants should be made by tho Local Committoo for tho district in which the hospital is situated, but that Committoo should communicate with tho Local Committee for tho district in which tho applicant resides and inform them of the action taken.6. Further Exceptions to the Rule Against Overlapping Payment.Allowances under tho following regulations can be given, notwithstanding the fact that&quot; tho &quot;applicant is in receipt of a grant from tho Military Service Civil Liabilities) Committee :-Regulation 7 (1) (d). ,,      7 (1) (ft). ..     7(2). ,,     10 (a). ,,    in (6).12.It is requested, however, that beforo making an allowance under Regulation 7 (1) (h) in cases where tho child in question had already attained the age of 14 before the award of the Civil Liabilities graiit, the Local Committee will communicate with the Civil Liabilities Committee and ascertain whether the amount of the grant made by the latter Committee is likely to be affected by tho proposed allowance.The Special Grants Committee have arranged to take this action &quot;before making awards in cases submitted to them under Regulations 7 (2) and 12. .Local Committees are reminded that Regulations 8 (a) and 13 have already been excluded trorn tho rule against over-lapping payments.March 31st, 1919. Circular 164.-Supplies of Stationery, Stores and Printing to Local War Pensions and Joint Disablement Committees,Arrangements now completed with the Stationery Office for the free supply of Stationery, &amp;c, to Local Committees (including District and Sub-Corn-mittees), and to Joint Committees.April 3rd, 1919. Circular 165.-Statistical Returns of Ad-vances.Returns to be made by Local Committees of payments mado to tide over the period between lodgment of claims and settlement.April 4th, 1919. Circular 166.-Provision of Dentures for Soldiers demobilised while awaiting them.At the urgent request of the Army Council, the Minister of Pensions has undertaken to arrange for the supply of artificial dentures to soldiers whose teeth have been extracted or who have received partial dental treatment with a view to the provision of dentures, but who, at the time of their deinobilisa-tion have not been fitted for the necessary artificial appliances.(2) Accordingly it has been decided that when a soldier is being medically examined for demobilisation under the provisions of paragraph 743 of the Army Demobilisation Regulations, the Medical Officer of the t nit will, if the soldier is awaiting the provision of dentures, endorse Army Form Z 22 in red ink with the words &quot;Awaiting the provision of artificial dentures.&quot; He will, at the same time furnisli the man with a certificate to the following effect :-&quot;I certify that (Nime)....................................(No.)..............(Rank) ....................................(Regiment)...............................,. .has received dentaltreatment whilst serving with a view to the provision of artificial dentures which have not yet been supplied.&quot;(Signed)..................................(Medical QtJkcr in Charge of Unit.)(3) When a demobilised soldier applies to a Committee, having in his possession the certificate referred to above, the Committee will arrange, subject to the provisions detailed below, for tho completion of his dental treatment and for the supply and fitting of the artificial dentures that he may require, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 of Correction Slip No. 9 to the Instructions on the Treatment of Disabled Men, 1918. The fact that the soldier has the certificate in his possession will be sufficient authority for a Committee to take action. It will not be necessary to consult the Medical Referee. When there is no such certifi-cate, a Committee should ascertain from the man the name of the Dental Centre at which bis teeth were extracted, and should telegraph to the Deputy Director of Medical Services of the Command in which the Dental Centre is situated, to obtain evidence of entitlement and to ascertain whether dentures are under construction (see paragraph 4 below).(4) Many cases will occur in which soldiers are demobilised during the actual making of their dentures by the Military Authotities,-.and in order to utilise these dentures where possible and thus avoid the waste of public money, arrangements are being made under which the Deputy Directors of Medical Services of Commands will distribute such dentures direct to tho Local Committees in whose area the men reside. On receipt of such dentures a Committee should arrange for them to bo litted (a) at tho nearest Army Dental Centre if practicable ; or if this is not practicable, (b) by local dental surgeons, in accordance with Correction Slip No. 9. Payment of the men&apos;s travelling expenses may be made in the usual way.(5) The fact that the soldier&apos;s Army Form Z 22 has been endorsed as indicated in paragraph 2 above, will be intimated in due courso to Local Com-mittees by memorandum from the Ministry, and in forwarding claims for payments made in cases dealt with under this Circular whore no extract from a Medical Board Report is available for submission as required by para, graph 5 of Correction Slip No. 9, this memorandum, or the Medical Oflicer&apos;s Certificate, or other&quot; evidence of entitlement obtained through tho Deputy Director of Medical Services of Commands, may be substituted for it.
Questions and Answers.Q. 241. Does the 20 per cent, bonus which was put on pensions, dependants allowances, &amp;c, last November apply to African War Pensions in the same manner as men disabled in the War 1914-1918.A.-Tke pensions of men disabled in the South African War are increased to the rates allowable for men disabled in the present war if the men are totally incapacitated by disabilities wholly due to war service, or if they received wounds or injuries corresponding to those specified&apos;in the first Schedule of the Royal Warrant of 11th April, 1918; and further, increased pensions and aivards receive the benefit of the 20 per cent, war bonus recently sanctioned.Q. 242.-While a pensioner is a patient in a hospital entirely supported by voluntary contributions, should the 7s. be subtracted from his pension ? If so, to whom and for what is it paid ?A. Yes; if the Local Committee has to pay for his maintenance and treatment. Paid to the hospital authori-ties as a contribution towards his maintenance.Q. 243.-AnN.CO. elects under Article 1 (4) of the Royal Warrant to renounce his claim to Service Pension in favour of the Conditional Disablement Pension at the rate appro-priate to his rank. If, in the event of its reduction, the Conditional Pension ceases to be more favourable than the Service Pension in addition to the Disablement Pension on the lowest scale,does his original choice debar him from claim-ing the latter which has then become the more favourable ?A. A Warrant or Non-commissioned Officer should always be given the award most favourable-to him at the time, e.g., if he elected to receive the disablemeni pension according to his rank and his health improves so that the disablement pension according to ranlc for which he would be eligible is less than he would receive as disablement pen-sion at the Class V rate in addition to his service pension he ivill be awarded the latter on his case being reviewed, without special application from him. Should he subse-quently become worse he would automatically revert to his disablement pension according to rank.Q. 244. Why is a wife&apos;s separation allowance in the case of a discharged disabled soldier continued for two weeks only, whilst the wife of a demobilised soldier draws hers for four weeks ?A. Disabled and demobilised soldiers are now treated&apos; alike i.e., they all receive the equivalent from one source or another of full Army pay and allowances for twenty-eight clays after discharge or demobilisation.Q. 245. I was transferred to Class W for mining on 14th December, 1918, after four years thirty-one days colour service, part active service in fyrance. Am I entitled to twenty-eight days&apos; pay and ration allowance ?A. This inquiry should be addressed to your Regimental Paymaster, who would have all the particulars available for a reply.Q. 246. I have received my discharge under Para. 392 XXV A ICR. Is this my final discharge or am I liable to be called for service again ?A.-Your discharge under Para: 392 XXV A is your final discharge.Q. 247. A son who has been serving has made an allotment in favour of his mother during the&apos; past two years, to which allowance has been added and the money drawn from the Post Office by ring paper. He has signed on for four years in the New Army. Will the mother still continue to draw the allowance ?A. It is understood that Separation Alloivance already in issue will for the present be continued to dependants of men re-enlisting in the New Army.Q. 248. A son of 16i has now signed on for the Air Service. Can application on P.A,5 be made for the mother?A. The lowest age at which a man can claim Special Parenfs Allowance is 18, so that a boy of 16i is not eligible for this allowance. If his parents were dependent on him prior to his enlistment he can, however, put forward a claim to Dependants Allowance.Q. 249. Is there a new &apos; Army Order consequent on increased rates of pay to serving men by which a wife may receive a larger compulsory allotment from her husband than 4d. a day ?A By Army Council Instruction 498 of 1918 the maximum amount ivhich can be compulsorily deducted from the pay of a private soldier was increased to 9d. a day for the support of a wife or children, and to M. a day in respect of a bastard child.Q. 250.-For how long and during what period, was the Army Order in force which refused Separation Allowance to a dependant for whom the soldier had not claimed within one month of enlistment? Was there a similar order for the Navy, and if so, was it for the same date ?A. Under Army Order 218 of 1915 it was laid down that, to secure consideration of applications for Separation Allowance for their dependants, soldiers must make appli-cation to the Commanding Officer, within one calendar month from the date of their enlistment. This was can-celled by Army Order 1 of 1916, in which it was stated that claims for separation Alloivance for the dependant of a soldier who enlisted before October 1st, 1915, ivould be considered if the application was received not later than December 10th, 1915.This Order was cancelled by Army Order 310 of 1916, by which the time limit was abolished. It ivas laid doion, however, that in cases of belated claims preferred more than one month after a soldier&apos;s enlistment, no payment was admissible prior to August 12nd, 1916. In Navy cases, an order limiting the period during ivhich a claim to Separation Allowance could be preferred to six months, came into force in October, 1915, but was abolished in Sep-tember, 1916.london published BY HIS MAJESTYS stationary OFFICE.
