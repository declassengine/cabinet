. gfltannlc-i....   *y of^&apos;&quot;&quot;(local GrOVERNMEKT BOARD, Whitehall, S.tf.l. 30th Hay, 1919.Sir,I am directed to forward herewith the following report on the work of the Local Government Board during the month of April.Yours faithfully,si     jif     $14**-&apos;&quot;***,  The Secretary,The War Cabinet.Secretary.1. HOUSING.Housing Bill. The Bill, which was introduced on the 18th March, has&apos;now (15th May) passed through Standing Committee A of the House of Commons,The principal modifications made in the Bill are as follows;-the terms of financial assistance to be afforded by the Government to Local Authorities are included in the Bill itself;if re-housing is to take place on part only of a cleared slum 3ite, the reduced compensation for the acquisition of the site (under the Bill, the compensation is reduced 7/here re-housing on the site is undertaken) is to be apportioned among all the owners of the site, including the owners of the part not to be used for re-housing;housing authorities are given power to acquire land to be sold subsequently for building development;   they are also given pov/er, subject to the consent of the Local Government Board, to sell (as well as to lease) houses;the provisions as to the conversion of houses into tenement dwellings have been remodelled and much amplified and now constitute a code to secure proper conditions as to sanitation, water supply, safety, etc., in houses which are converted into Yforking class dwellings, or which are already let in tenements;hpusing authorities are given power, in default of theowner, to execute repairs where necessary and to charge the cost to the owner;housing authorities are given power to lend money for converting houses into v/orking class dwellings;an authority may be required to prepare a town planning scheme in any case in which the Board think it is necessary;   and within three years after the 1st
January, 1923, the preparation of town planning schemes is made compulsory for all urban areas with a population of 20,000 or over;under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, local authorities may lend money to enable an occupier to purchase his house;   under the Act these powers could be exercised only in respect of houses not exceeding  400 in value; it was proposed to substitute  500 in the Bill;    700 has been substituted in Committee.(2)   Regulations as to Financial Assistance. The Board have issued two Parliamentary PapersTcopfes annexedf   appendices 1 and 2) setting out the proposed regulations governing the financial assistance which it is proposed should be paid under the Bill, (a)   to Local Authorities in respect of approved schemes involving a loss in excess of a penny rate, and (b) to Public Utility Societies.    One of the principal purposes of the proposed regulations is to secure that all reasonable economy is exercised and, as regards Public Utility Societies, that due security is afforded to tenants.(3)   Advisory Housing Council. An Advisory Council is being set up for the consideration of large questions of principle and it is contemplated that this Council will be a nucleus from which sub-committees will be formed with additional members to consider detailed technical questions.Three such sub-committees have already been formed, on each of which a member of the Advisory Council will serve as Chairman.     These sub-committees are to consider - (l) the standardisation of methods and materials and the use of new methods and materials;   (2) the revision of Forms of Contract, Specification and Schedules;   and (3) the financial safeguards required in connection with housing schemes.(4)   Parliamentary Housing Group. A Housing Group, the members of which at present number about 80, has been formed in the House of Commons.     It is proposed that this group shall meet each week.     Sir John Tudor Walters was elected Chairman of the Group and Sir Kingsley Wood is acting as Secretary.The object in forming the Group is to provide a means for frank discussion of difficulties with Members particularly interested in the question of housing and to secure the help of Members in pressing forward measures for the solution of the problem, for stimulating any laggard authorities and for disseminating information as to the government proposals.    Bach Member is being furnished regularly with particulars as to the progress of housing in his constituency;   and arrangements are being made for conferences between the Housing Commissioners and the Members for constituencies in their area.(5)   Housing Manual.. A Manual on the preparation of State-aided Housing Schemes was completed early in the month and issued to^local authorities.     It contains infor-mation as to the State financial assistance, the kind of schemes to which assistance will be given and the supply of materials and suggestions as to the selection and the planning of sites.     A number of model house plans also are reproduced.
(6)   Public Utility Societies. Progress is being made in the submission of scnemes by Public Utility Societies. Building schemes have been submitted in 14 cases, involving, eventually, 11,000 to 12,000 houses, and in addition to these the Board are aware of tentative proposals which will add another 4,000 houses to the total.    Over 200 inquiries have been received from companies, societies, firms and individuals who are interested in the promotion of Public Utility Societies.As previously indicated the Board have issued a White Paper (Cd.128) setting out the proposed regulations governing financial assistance to Public Utility Societies and Housing Trusts.     A Housing Trust will not need to borrow from the State, but the Trustees may receive a subsidy similar to that which would be granted to a Public Utility Society, if they undertake the provision of working class houses during the present emergency period.The White Paper in question also contains model rules for Public Utility Societies;   the rules will be regarded as sufficient compliance v/ith the draft regulations, so far as those regulations deal with matters which must be provided for in the rules.The Board have also published a booklet (appendix 3) explaining in simple terms how a Public Utility Society may be formed for the provision of working-class houses and what are the proposals of the Government for encouraging and assisting Societies.(?)    regress of Housing Schemes. The table in appendix 4 gives information of the progress of housing schemes up to the 3rd of Kay.    Up to that date - 1,096 applications for sites (covering about 16,620 acres;   sufficient, roughly for some 166,000 houses) had been submitted by Local Authorities, exclusive of applications withdrawn or rejected. 413 of these applications had been sanctioned.211 applications for lay-outs had been received from Local Authorities, of which 89 had been sanctioned.In 153 cases house plans had been submitted for 8,990 houses, and approval had been given in 77 of these cases, for 3,449 houses.Tenders for the erection of houses have been passed in seven cases, for 817 houses, the largest scheme being at Sheffield,    Arrangements are being made for the Board to be kept informed of the progress of building and information has been received in a number of cases that the building of houses has commenced,M   Supply of Materials, The negotiations undertaken by the Board to secuFe a supply of materials for the housing schemes assisted by them have proved very intricate, involving as they do not only matters of supply but matters of transport.    Arrangements are, however, being   -made to obtain the necessary supplies and so far the following arrangements have been made.    Orders have been placed by the Ministry of Supplies for nearly 840,000,000 bricks (there is now a large quantity of bricks in stook); about 200,000 tons of cement are in stock and available; definite orderB have been placed for over 2,000,000 slates and negotiations are in hand for the purchase of a further
20,000,000 slates.    There will be no risk that approved schemes will be held up by inability to obtain materials.(9) Housing and Building Trade Exhibition. It has been arranged, in agreement with the Board of Trade, to hold ; a Housing and Building Trade Exhibition in the autumn, and a . request for a grant haB been addressed to the Treasury. It is confidently expected however, that the Exhibition will pay for itself;   the grant is required only as a safeguard.The advantages of an Exhibition in stimulating competition among builders and manufacturers, in bringing to the notice of Local Authorities and others concerned the best and most economical designs, fittings and the like cannot but be great, and may result in laige savings.A small Exhibition at Birmingham is being arranged for July and it is hoped to arrange for similar Exhibitions at other provincial towns.II. HEALTH.(l)   Ministry of Health Bill. The Bill was read a third time in the rfouse of Commons early in April and was read a second time in the House of Lords on the 1st of May.    The Committee stage in the House of Lords was completed on the 13th of May, the most important alterations being the insertion of amendments providing (a) that the Ministry shall have one Parliamentary Secretary only, and (b) that in the making of appointments of secretaries, officers and servants, equal consideration shall be given to the suitability of persons of both sexes.(2)   Small Pox, There have been several localised out-breaka of Small Pox in England during the month of April, the most serious being at Pontefract where eleven cases were notified.    This outbreak, like eome others that have recently occurred, was due to the introduction of disease by a demobilised soldier returning from Italy through Prance. The Local Government Board make prompt investigations of all outbreaks of Small Pox at the present time, and during the month the Board1s Medical Inspectors enquired into cases at Lincoln, Pontefract, FeatherBtone, Chorley Wood, East Ham, Twickenham and Bury St. Edmunds.(3)   Venereal Diseases. By the end of April, 1919, 141 U&amp;tn Treatment Centres for Venereal Diseases were open, an increase of 6 during the month, and further facilities for treatment have been provided by the opening of additional Auxiliary Centres and by the holding of additional clinics at some of the Hain Treatment Centres.    Hiie number of persona dealt with in England and Wales under the arrangements for providing free treatment for cases of venereal diseaae during the calendar year 1918 amounted to over 56,000, these persons made nearly 474,000 out-patient attendances at the Centres.(4)   Tuberculousia. A memorandum has been issued to the local authorities&apos; responsible for the schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis asking them to inspect hutments which have been used for war purposes with a view to the acquisition of suitable hutments for use as additional accommodation at sanatoria or hospitals for the treatment of tuberculosis.
138 additional beds for the treatment of tuberculosis were provided during the month and proposals for the provision of some 600 further beds were received.



(5) Rabies. Rabies in England and Wales had up to the commencement of April occurred only in Devon and Cornwall and in South Wales. During the month the Board of Agriculture confirmed the prevalence of the disease in dogs in Surrey and Middlesex and muzzling orders embracing wide areas in the neighbourhood of the Metropolis were issued.



The Board, in order to provide additional facilities for the treatment of person bitten by rabid dogs, arranged that treatment should be given at St. Thomas&apos; Hospital, London, with material supplied from the Pasteur Institute Paris.



The Board also issued to every Local Authority and Medical Officer of Health in England and Wales and sent to the Press a revised memorandum giving information as to the procedure recommended to be followed in the case of persons bitten by rabid dogs.



(6) Mecca Pilgrimage. The pilgrimage to Mecca has largely been in abeyance during the War. The movement of pilgrims over long distance has in the past afforded means for the spread of exotic disease over large areas and on several occasions it has been the means of spreading disease of this character to Europe from Asia or Africa. The re-opening of the pilgrimage, with the railway facilities which now exist, has necessitated that the question of the control of the pilgrimage from the stand-point of health shall be very carefully considered and an Interdepartmental Committee has been set up at the Foreign Office for this purpose. Dr. Bucharan is the representative of the Board on the Committee.



(7) Maternity and Child Welfare. The Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, enables local authorities to make such arrangements as may be sanctioned by the Board for attending to the health of expectant and nursing mothers and of children under the age of five years who are not being educated in schools recognised by the Board of Education. The Local Government Board make grants equal to half the approved expenditure of the local authorities and of voluntary agencies who co-operate with them in this work.



Schemes have been adopted by all the Metropolitan Boroughs, all the County Beroughs, 58 of the 61 County Councils and 310 County Districts. Of the County Schemes 14 cover the whole county and, with five or six exceptions, the remainder cover the whold county excluding County Districts for which separate schemes have been approved.



During the year 1918-1919 the Board made grants amounting to nearly £220,000 - £161,000 to Local Authorities and £58,000 to Voluntary agencies. The grants to Voluntary agencies include £21,000 to Centres, £18,000 to Homes, £13,000 to County Nursing Associations, and £5,500 to other Institutions providingthe services of midwives. The grants to County Nursing Associations aid the Midwifery service provided by 2,200 District Nursing Associations.



The total amount of the grant to be paid by the Board during the present financial year in respect of maternity and child welfare is estimated at £400,000.




During the past month the Board have approved proposals by 64 Local Authorities for extending their schemes. The number of Health Visitors was increased by 14, the number of municipal Centres by 4, and the number of Voluntary Centres by 3.On the 30th of April, 1919, there were 856 municipal and 661 voluntary Centres;   Local Authorities employed 819 whole time and 854 part time Health Visitors;   voluntary societies employed 333 Health Visitors;   1,105 District Nurses were also employed as part time Visitors by Local Authorities who make payment to the Nursing Associations.(8)   Food Standards.   The Pood &quot;Controller has forwarded for the Board&apos;s observations a draft of a Bill to obtain permanent powers to prescribe standards of quality for foods and requiring certain foods to be sold by net weight.   The question of issuing standards of genuineness for food and food materials has received considerable attention on the part of the Board in the past and a Bill on the subject was put forward by them in 1913 but did not reach second reading.   The Beard are arranging to co-operate with the Food Controller in his proposals.III.   GENERAL.(1)   Loans for Public work.- The Treasury have now completely withdrawn their restriction on the borrowing of money by Local Authorities and a circular letter informing Local Authorities was issued by the Board on the 17th April,The Board are therefore new in a position to consider applications for their sanction to loans on their merits, but, in deference to the wishes of the Treasury, they pay special regard to the question whether the works are urgently required either in themselves or as affording work for the unemployed.During the month of April, 139 applications for sanction to loans were received by the Board, as against 117 during 1/iaroh,The total amount of the loans sanctioned during the month was  717,282 as against  967,185 during March.   The decrease is largely accounted for by the fact that during March it was necessary for Local Authorities to obtain further sanction before they could borrow money under sanctions issued prior to the 12th March, 1915, and the figure for March included loans thus resanctioned.   The resanctioning of loans sanctioned prior to Karon, 1915, was rendered unnecessary by the withdrawal of the Treasury restrictions and the loans sanotioned in April related almost exclusively to new expendi-ture.The principal purposes for which loans were sanctioned during April were electricity undertakings (accounting for nearly three-fifths of the total), sewerage works, street improvements and schools.In view of the removal of the restrictions on borrow-ing, it has been decided that it is no longer fteoesBary to limit the Board&apos;s sanction to the amount which it is estimated will be expended within nine months,
A White Paper has been issued (Cmd.140. oopy annexed; appendix 5) giving particulars of public works being executed or contemplated by Looal Authorities.(2)   Third Register of Electors -   The Autumn Register of Eleotora is due to be prepared very shortly.   A oonferenoe has been held with representatives of the Admiralty, War Office, Air Board, the Scottish and Irish Offices, Registration Offices, and Head Party Agents as to the preparation of this Register. It was considered that the conditions still prevailing rendered it very desirable that tho dates and periods fixed by the Representation of the People Act, 1918, should be altered so as to give sufficient time for the Register to be properly prepared to come into force on the 15th October next, and that an Order in Council should be made fixing the qualifying period at the six months ending on the 15th June and modifying the dates for the publication of the electors lists, the making of claims and objections, etc., accordingly.(3)   Relief of War Distress.- The following grants have been made from the National Relief Fund on the recommendation of the Government Committee during the month of April:-To Local Representative Committee for  .the provision of direct assistance (including  5,950 to Local Representative Committees in East Coast districts) .........   8,060To Local Representative Committees for the relief of air raid distress.............       80To the Central Charities Committee for the relief of repatriated British civilians .....   1,500Total ......   9,430(4)   Repatriation of Belgian Refugees. -   The work of repatriating the refugees is now rapidly drawing to a close. During the month of April the number repatriated at the cost cf the British Government was just ever 10,000.   upwards of 6,000 returned at their own expense during the same period.Since the end of April a further 1,000 have gone back at their own expense and nearly 1,000 by the last two Government transports, which sailed on the 6th May.   more Government transports will not be provided.The work commenced in the latter part of November and although much hampered at first by restricted shipping facilities has proceeded smoothly.   Up to date 73,000 have been sent back free of charge, cf whom 61,000 proceeded to Antwerp;   some 26,000 or 27,000 have travelled at their own expense, the majority going from Dover to Ostend.Assistance from Government Funds to refugees in this country will cease generally as from the 3rd instant, and those who have neglected to Navail themselves of the offer of a. free passage, to Belgium will be left to their own resources, except in &quot;cases where their failure to accept a passage was due to   . illness or other- suffioient cause.   The Belgian Government have arranged for assistance for a short time in this claaa of cases, by a Belgian Society in..London, who have been supplied by their own.government;.with the*BeGessary funds for the purpose.  &quot;The . Board will kive,&amp; free passage by the &quot;Belgian mail service and --/ C:-S .   ; -a- -
also free railway transport to Dover for any of these refugees who are able tb travel during the present month.(5)   Poor ^aw Officers, Conditions of Service. -   The Executive qi the Hational Poor Law Officers&apos; Association passed a resolution approving the principle of a 44 hours&apos; working week, with one whole day&apos;s rest in seven, and asked the President of the Local Government Board to receive a deputation on the subject.   The President replied that although the Department has a special interest in the conditions of work of Poor Law Officers, he feels that the responsibility for the consideration of the Report of the Committee on relations between employers and employed and its application must rest with the Kiniatry of Labour, end that the Deputation should address itself to the Ministry of Labour.   A copy of the correspondence was sent to the Linistry of Labour.A number of other representations on similar subjects have been received.   The Board have intimated in reply to enquiries on the subject that no special legislation in regard to a revision of the Exchequer Grant made to Guardians in respect of salaries of officers (under Section 26 of the Looal Government Act, 1888) is at present contemplated.(6)   Pauperism,* During the quarter ended Karon last there have been a number of disturbing factors, eaoh tending to bring about an increase in the number of persons receiving relief, namely, increased unemployment, labour disputes, and a third, but milder, epidemic of influenza.Normally, the number of persons receiving relief, after rising during January, remains about stationary during February end falls by several thous&amp;nd in liar oh.   This year, however, there waa a rise of 5,000 in February and a further rise of 1,000 in March, to a total of 466,000 due doubtless to the obnditione already mentioned.   Even the 466,000, however, is muoh below the figures for the corresponding period of previous years,(V)   yilitary Occupation of Poor Law Premises.-  The Military Authorities continue to&apos;&quot;return to Boards of Guardians Poor Law Institutions used as Military HospitalB.   Up to the end of April the number of beds vacated by them was according to information obtained from the War Office, 16,678, the number still in military possession being &quot;56,808,   The total amount of the claims lodged by the Guardians up to the end of Maroh for compensation for the military use of Poor Law premises was  4,420,000.   Up to the end of April the district Auditors had dealt with claims amounting to  3,891,000 of whioh they had certified  3,844,000.W   Off^oe Staff Committee.- Ab a preliminary to the establishment of a Whitley Council for the Department cf the Ministry of Health, it has been deoided to set up in the Local Government Board a provisional Staff Committee. Representatives of the clerical and adminiatrative grades of the staff have been elected and the Committee haB held its first meeting.

SCHEDULE.Rules with regard to the determination of Rents. 1. The rents to be charged after the 31st day of March, 1927, should be sufficient to cover (in addition to the expenses of main-tenance and management of the houses and a suitable allowance for depreciation) the interest which would have been payable on the capital cost of building the houses if they had been built after that date,2. The Local Authority in first fixing the rents under an. assisted scheme may have regard to the rents obtaining in the locality for houses for the working classes, and to the operation of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act. 1915, and any Acts amending or extending that Act; but in that case the Local Authority should also have regard to:  (a) any increase of rents authorised by any such Acts:; and(b) any superiority in the condition of the houses to be letby them under the assisted scheme or in the accom-modation provided therein. 3. If it appears that the rents as first fixed under the assisted scheme will require to be increased before the 31st day of March, .1927, in order that the intention of these rules may be complied with, such increase should be effected by yearly or half-yearly additions to the rents during the nnanciaF years or half-years succeeding that in which the rents were first fixed.IL-Copy of Circular issued by the Local Government Board to Local Authorities on the 6th February, 1919.Sir,1. I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to inform you that His Majeisty&apos;s Government have reconsidered the terms of financial assistance previously pro-promised to Local Authorities in connection with the provision of houses for the working classes at the present time. The Govern-ment desire that the partnership between the State and the Local Authorities should be such as to secure the rapid erection of the large number of houses needed to make good the existing shortage, and they believe that under the terms now proposed they will be able to rely upon the active support and energetic co-operation of the Local Authorities as a whole.2. The Municipal Corporations Association and a number of individual Local Authorities in the representations which they have addressed to the Government in regard to the previous scheme have referred to the element of uncertainty as to the burden which might have to be borne by Local Authorities, and have pressed for a declaration that in no case should the annual burden falling on the Local Authority exceed the produce of a rate of one penny in the  .3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been desirous of meeting these representations as far as practicable, and they have now
approved the adoption of a scheme under which the burden \Ifj[p Local Authorities would be limited as nearly as possible to the amount suggested.    Parliamentary approval for these proposals will be obtained at the earliest practicable date.4. In accordance with the revised scheme the terms set out in the paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 of the Circular Letter of the 18th March, 1918, will be superseded by the following terms:  Assisted Schemes.(a) The housing schemes of Local Authorities to which the State will be prepared to grant financial assistance, if they are submitted to the Local Government Board within twelve months from this date and carried out within a period of two years from this date, or within such further period as may be approved by the Local Government Board, are:  (1) Schemes carried out by Local Authorities under Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, for any area for which the Local Government Board are satisfied that it is desirable that houses for the working classes should be provided.(2) Rehousing schemes in connection with Improvement and Reconstruction schemes under Parts I. and II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except that no part of the cost of acquiring and clearing a site would be made the subject of financial assistance if either (a) the site had been acquired or cleared before the date of this letter, or (b) the needs of the district could, in the opinion of the Local Government Board, be adequately met by means of a scheme under Part III.Loans.(b) The full cost o&apos;f a scheme will in the first instance he met out of a loan or loans raised by the Local Authority, and it is particularly desired by the Treasury that Authori-ties should raise such loans in the open market wherever it is possible for them to do so. As the financial assistance to be granted from Public Funds for housing schemes will take the form of a subsidy as explained below, and as it is important to secure that the whole of the State assistance may be given under one head, any loans granted from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of assisted schemes will not be made at the preferential rates ordinarily allowed for housing loans, but at a rate fixed by the Treasury so as to correspond with the full current market rate of interest.General Principle of Financial Assistance.(c) In respect of any housing scheme or series of housing schemes carried out by a Local Authority within the period referred to above, Parliament will be asked to vote financial assistance calculated on a basis estimated to relieve the Local Authority of the burden of any annual deficit in so
far as it exceeds the produce of a rate of a penny in the   on the area chargeable, but there will be no contribu-tion towards the cost where the annual excess of expenditure over income would not exceed that amount.Provisional Estimates.(cl) In order to avoid delay in the commencement of schemes the settlement of the actual amount of the State subsidy will be deferred until after the houses have been built and let, but payments on account will, if necessary,; be made on provisional estimates of income and expenditure approved by the Board.Settlement or Subsidy during Transitional Period.(e) When the houses have been built and iet the amount of the subsidy to be paid thereafter during&apos; a transitional period ending 31st March, 1927, will be settled on a basis of a revised balance-sheet showing the actual expendi-ture incurred and the actual rents obtained. The interest charged on loans will be taken at the amounts actually to be paid if the loans are raised from the.Local Loans Fund of other outside sources. Where the money is provided from accumulated funds in the hands of the Local Authority interest will be calculated at the rate in force for loans for assisted housing schemes from the Local Loans Fund (unless the Local Authority is also borrowing from other outside sources in respect of its scheme, in which case interest should be charged on advances from accumu-lated funds at the rate paid for the loans from such other outside sources). Where there is found to be a deficit in excess of the produce of a rate of a penny in the  , the rate of annual contribution so determined will hold good for the remainder of the transitional period.In making this interim adjustment the Local Government Board will reserve the right of reducing the amount of the subsidy in any case in which there is evidence of failure on the part of the Local Authority to secure due economy in the erection or management of the houses, or that the best rents obtainable are not in fact being obtained.Final Adjustment.(/) At the end of the transitional period the whole posi-tion will be reviewed in the light of the actual working of the scheme during that period, raid the annual amount thereafter to be provided out of public funds will be adjusted as follows. The amount of the estimated annual expendi-ture will be compared anew with the amount of the esti-mated annual income, and if as a result of this comparison it appears that the future annual charges to he borne by the Local Authority are likely to exceed the produce of a rate of a penny in the  , the annual subsidy for the remainder
of the period of tho loan will be finally fixed at a calculated to cover this excess, subject only to such adjuft-mentas may be required in consequence of any variation in the amount produced by a penny rate.At the final adjustment it will be open to the Local Govern-in ent Board to reduce the amount of the State contribution if there has been evidence of failure on the part of the Local Authority to exercise due economy in management or in securing the best rents obtainable. In the event of the Local Authority and the Local Government Board being unable to reach an agreement on any such question the matter will be referred for final settlement to some indepen-dent tribunal.(^) In the case of a Rural District the produce of a rate of a penny in the   for the purpose of the scheme will be based on the assessable value of the whole District unless very strong grounds are shown for a declaration under Section 31 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc. Act, 1909, which would impose the cost of a housing scheme on a contributory place or contributory places in the district. 5. In order to secure that Local Authorities may have advice and assistance locally available to them and to avoid delays, the President is arranging for the appointment of a certain number of Housing Commissioners whose duty it will be to consider and discuss with the Local Authorities in their areas the needs of each district in regard to housing, and to advise and assist them both in the preparation and in the execution of schemes.Each Commissioner will have an office in his district, and his address will be comnrunicated to each Local Authority and otherwise notified in due course for the information of all oon-cerned. It is the desire of the President that the greatest possible use may be made in every instance of the Commissioner and his expert assistants, but he wishes to make it clear to all Local Authorities that the object of the appointment of these Commissioners is not to diminish the responsibility of the Local Authorities., but to give them assistance and advice and at the same time to relieve the Central Department of some of the detailed work in connection with the schemes.Under the new organisation it will be possible for schemes to be dealt with by stages, and thus to avoid the friction and delay which might be caused if schemes did not come before the Central Department until they have reached the final stage.0. The Local Authorities will recognise that, while the revised terms of financial assistance set out in the earlier part of this Circular are exceptionally advantageous from their point of view, they will impose a corresponding responsibility both upon the Local Authorities and. upon the Central Department to secure economical construction and management.Under the organisation above described the Housing Commis-sioners will be working in the closest possible co-operation with the Local Authorities at all stages. At the same time the Local Government Board will expect the Local Authorities themselves
njf&amp;xercise effective supervision in regard to the cost of con-struction and the rents obtained, which should approximate as nearly as circumstances permit to the economic level.7. In order to promote economy and to assist Local Authori-ties and others engaged in the provision of houses for the working classes, the President is causing certain articles used in the provision of such houses to be standardised. Local Authorities will shortly be furnished with a list and description, with dimensions, of the standardised articles, and it is contem-plated that unless the circumstances are shown to be very exceptional these shall be specified and adopted in every scheme. Steps are also being taken to secure the production of large quantities of doors, window frames, and various other fittings of standardised patterns, and to secure an adequate supply of bricks suited to the needs of various localities. A further announcement on this subject will be made shortly, but in the meantime the Local Authorities need have no hesitation-tion in proceeding with the preparation of their schemes on account of anticipated shortage of materials.8. The Board are about to issue a Manual embodying detailed proposals in regard to the preparation and submission of schemes, suggestions as to lay-out and designs with plans, including premiated designs of the Royal Institute of British Architects and plans recommended by Sir J&quot;. Tudor &quot;Walters&apos; Committee, and the latest information in regard to improved methods of construction and building materials and house fittings.9. With regard to the acquisition of land, an arrangement has been made with the Board of Inland Revenue, under which the Superintending Valuers in the service oi that Department will be prepared on the invitation of the Local Authority to express an opinion as to the present value of any site definitely selected by the Local Authority for housing purposes, and, if desired by the Local Authority, the Inland Revenue Valuation Office will undertake negotiations for the purchase of such sites provided that prior notice of their intention to acquire has been given to the owner by the Local Authority. This arrangement will provide for both parties the opinion of an independent authority to serve as a guide to the real value of the property in question, and it may be anticipated that the number of cases in which the parties fail to agree will thus be reduced, and the delay and expense of arbitration avoided..10. With a view to supplementing the provision of houses by Local Authorities the Government desire to encourage Public Utility Societies to undertake building operations, and it is accordingly their intention to propose to Parliament that finan-cial assistance should be given to such Societies carrying out housing schemes within the same period as that which will apply to Local Authorities. A Memorandum explaining the scope of the proposed assistance, and the conditions on which it will be granted, is in- preparation and a copy will be forwarded for the inforrnatiomof the Local Authority at an early date. &quot;
11. I am to add that it is the intention of the Government ^r\ propose legislation during the coming Session to give furihtr poAvers to Local Authorities in regard to the provision of houses for the working classes, to&apos; enable Local Authorities under the Housing Acts to assist Public Utility Societies by subscribing to their capital and otherwise, to deal with bye-laws and local Act provisions which may be found, to impede desirable housing proposals, and generally to facilitiate the execution of schemes,.12. In view of the pressing urgency of the housing situation, the preparation of their schemes by the Local Authorities should not be postponed until the introduction of the proposed legisla-tion. Having regard to the terms of financial assistance now offered, the arrangements which are being made for the pro-vision of materials, and the supply of labour which is becoming available owing to the cancellation of war contracts and the demobilisation of the Forces, there should be no reason for any delay. The Government and the Country are looking to the Local Authorities to start at once upon the housing schemes which are rightly regarded as forming one of the most urgent and essential parts of the whole programme of Reconstruction.I am, Sir,Tour obedient servant,H.

(2) The amount of the Exchequer subsidy shall be the equivalent of thirty per centum of the annual charges which would have been payable, in respect of interest and repayment of principal, on the capital expended by the Trustees for the purposes of the approved scheme if that capital had been raised by way of a loan advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, on the same terms as those granted for the time being to a PublicUtility Society for the like purposes : Provided that the Board may reduce the amount of the Exchequer subsidy in any case in which they are satisfied that the capital expenditure incurred by the Trustees has been excessive.

III. Draft Model Rules for Public Utility Societies.MEMORANDUM.In order to qualify for financial assistance under the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Bill, which is now before Parliament, a Public Utility Society will have to frame its rules so as to comply with the require-ments of the Bill, when it becomes law, and of any regulations which may be made by the Local Government Board thereunder.The rules must show that the objects of the Society include the provision, improvement, and management of houses for the working classes, and must provide that the rate of interest on any share, and on any moneys borrowed by the Society or any loan stock issued by them, shall not exceed the rate of 6 per cent, per annum. These requirements can be met by the adaptation of existing &quot; common form &quot; rules.Complete sets of model rules have been drawn up by several associations whose object is to promote the formation of Public Utility Societies; and these include the rules (embodying the requirements of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts) which have been prescribed by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, by whom the Society must be registered.The further requirements which would have to be met in order to comply with the draft regulations are set out below in the form of rules. It is intended that these rules should be regarded as models which may be adopted subject to such modifications as may be necessary to meet the particular circumstances (provided that the regulations are complied with). The)?- are not intended to deal exhaustively with the subject-matter to which they refer, and in practice they will be incorporated with other rules or groups or rules dealing with the same subject-matter.MODEL RULES.1. Membership. The members of the Society shall be those persons whose names are appended to these Rules, and any other persons whom the Board of Managementjmay admit. Every member shall hold at least one share in the Society. The Board of Management shall not refuse to admit to membership^&apos;of the Society any person who has been a tenant of the Society for not less than three months.
2. Tenant Members&apos; Committee. Tenant members shall elect annually from among themselves a Tenant Members&apos; Committee* consisting of members and each tenant member shall be entitled to one vote for the election of such Committee. The Committee, in addition to the rights, powers and duties which are conferred on or vested in them by these Eules, shall have such rights, powers and duties as may be delegated to them, with their concurrence, by the Board of Management.3. Management of Business of Society. The management of the business of the Society shall be vested in the Board of Management for the time being, who may either directly or by delegation exercise all such powers as may be exercised by the Society, except those expressly required by these rules or by statute to be exercised by the Society in general meeting.i. Appointment of Board of Management. The Board of Manage-ment, from the date of registration of the Society to the first annual general meeting of the Society, shall consist of those persons whose names are appended to these Rules, with power to add to their number. In all subsequent periods the Board shall consist of not less than five or more than twelve members. Two of such, members, or, if the total number of members exceeds eight, three of such members shall be tenant members appointed by the Tenant Members&apos; Committee.. The remaining members shall be elected at the annual general meeting of the Society, f5. Votes of Members. At all general meetings of the Society each fully paid-up share against which there is no set-off in the books of the Society shall carry one vote, and five times that amount of loan stock held by a member or tenant member shall carry one vote, but the possession of loan stock apart from membership shall not entitle its holder either to a vote or to attendance at meetings. Votes may be given personally or by proxy.J6. Security of Tenure. Each tenant shall have undisturbed &apos; occupancy of his house and garden so long as (a) He fulfils the tenancy regulations made by the Board of management;(b) He pays any rent or debts due from him to the Society; and(c) He and the occupants of his house avoid any conduct detri-mental to good neighbourship : Provided that a tenant shall not be given notice to quit by the Board of Management on the ground of conduct detrimental to good neigh-bourship except with the concurrence of the Tenant Members&apos; Committee.* The Committee may, if desired, be a Tenants&apos; Committee, appointed by all the tenants of the Society. But in that case the Rules must provide that the members of the Board of Management appointed by the Committee must be tenant members of the Society.  See Rule 4.t The Rules may if desired provide for the representation of Local Author-ities on the Board of Management.X The regulations admit of further limitation being imposed on the number of votes which may be recorded by any one member.
* Under the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Bill the rate will be 6 per cent.Local Government Board, 28th April, 1919.   4. .. m7. Application of Profits. Any profits remaining to the Society after providing for (a) The annual charges in respect of interest and repayments of principal, on the loans and loan stock raised by the Society ;(6) The taxes, rates, rents, insurance premiums, or other charges payable by the Society in respect of any land or houses belonging to them;(c) The costs of administration and management and of repairsof property ;(d) Such allocations to a reserve fund as may be determined bythe Board of Management;ie) Any other necessary expenses incurred by the Board of Manage-ment; and 4(/) A dividend not exceeding the rate authorised by Eule *, ,on the share capital of the Society ;shall be applied, in such manner as the Board of Management may determine, for the benefit of the tenants generally.8. Regulations by the Local Government Board. In order that financial assistance may be obtained from the Exchequer under the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act, 1919, towards the loan charges in respect of any houses provided by the Society under a scheme approved by the Local Government Board under that Act, the regulations made by that Board, which are set out in the appendix to these rules, shall in all respects be complied with, and these rules, so far as they apply to any subject-matter of those regulations shall have effect subject to&apos; those regulations.

Public Utility societies and the Provision of Working-Class HousesHow the Government I    will Help ThemIM^^HE  Governments intention (as outlined I j      in the Housing Bill) to provide financial I ]      help to Public Utility Societies to en-I courage and enable them to build working-lass houses has evoked a series of questions as to (hat Public Utility Societies are, how they may be jrmed, and by whom, what qualifications they must pssess before Government help can be given them, lat assistance it is that they can get from the Govern-lent, and so on. These questions it is the aim of this amphlet to answer in simple terms, with a view to roviding preliminary and general information to all lose for whom the Governments proposals may have i interest.(957) Wt. 952/964/SOP 90 4/19 20m  D.St.  (2)
i.o0;the formation and scope of a public utility society.it will be realised that public utility societies t^,, with the assistance offered, do much to supplement j provision of working-class houses by local authorif I existing societies, such as co-operative societies, g extend their scope of operations to include the provifj of working-class houses; and new societies may formed.   suppose, for example, that fellow worljj in a factory or works, or on the land, or fellow memi of a club or society, or any other group of men or wofj having some link of common interest, wish to hi houses and to get government assistance in the builoj it is through a public utility society that they can if readily obtain it. by this means also an employer ii be enabled to combine with his workpeople in the I vision of suitable houses, and others interested enlightened housing reform can be helped to s^j their object.thus, the public utility society attains a I importance in the solution of the national housing pjr2) lem, as affording the readiest channel through \*J groups of people anxious to provide workings
Buses My obtain the help which the Government pro-jses to afford.Qjiflt is a Public Utility Society ?.jj (i) It is a Society registered under the Industrial 1 and Provident Societies Act of 1893 (the fl Act under which Co-operative Societies are J registered), for carrying on &quot; any industries, )rl businesses or trades specified in or authorised nj    by its rules.&quot;f0lIn order to qualify for registration under that Act a Society must have not less than seven members, and a secretary, and the share holding of any individual member must not exceed  200, but this limit does not apply to holdings of Loan Stock. It must also comply with the regula-sc tions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies as I   to audit, examination, and publication of itsI   accounts, etc.a II Hp) It must by its rules prohibit the payment either n   of interest or of dividend at a rate exceeding the ig-jj   statutory limit. (This is at present 5 per cent.,
but under the housing bill it is piooseat extend the limit to 6 per cent.).(3) it must include the provision of working-cw houses as one of its &quot; industries, businesses! , trades.&quot;!rFurther Necessary Qualifications. heIbuin order, however, to qualify for the financial hjfj which the government proposes to provide for wdrldjd class housing schemes, a public utility society mj conform with one or two further conditions. it nfu submit its housing schemes for the approval of is local government board, and must comply with s(j regulations as may be made by that department w^en the housing bill becomes law. lcjihit may be explained at this point that any a regulations will be framed mainly to ensure that 1 3 interests of the tenants and the community i adequately safeguarded in such matters as fair refal sentation for the tenants on the society&apos;s boarcjh management, reasonable security of tenure, the pr&amp;e\ supervision and audit of the society&apos;s accounts, \ ai the preservation of good neighbourship. f t
illTo Form a Public Utility Society.Clfcow may a Public Utility Society S : formed ?I Seven or more persons wishing to promote a scheme I building working-class houses meet together, heir first step should be to consult the Government busing Commissioner for their district.  (The names % addresses of the Housing Commissioners for Eng-kijjd and Wales are printed at the end of this leaflet in nj Appendix. In the case of Scotland, communications nfluld be addressed to the Local Government Board f I Scotland, Edinburgh). The Housing Commissioner - si be ready to give information as to whether the wfeme is likely to conflict: with others already in ad in the same area. He will also be able to help h advice as to the suitability of proposed sites and ^ns, and as to the availability of materials.y Ij-glaution.areffhe next step in ordinary circumstances would be pr&amp;even members of the group, and the Secretary, to :Sj I an &quot; application for registration &quot; and to send it, I two printed copies of their proposed rules as a.
Society, (which also must be signed by the l%t eigi persons)-to:The Registrar of Friendly Societies, Central Office, British Museum (North Entrance) i Montague Place, W.C.i.    f!But people who have had no experience in 4 formation and working of a Public Utility Society wo i be well advised, before attempting to draw up rules ijjP to register their Society, to communicate with one^ other of the central housing organisations which rn^ ( a speciality of the promotion of Public Utility Societs and to obtain their guidance and help, which will readily given. ^.In the report to the Government of the Hobhl Committee on Public Utility Societies, several of tl central housing organisations were mentioned I (3. name, among them : The Garden Cities and Town Planning Assof ^ tion, of 3, Gray&apos;s Inn Place, London, Wl;sjiThe Housing Organisation Society, of the jpuj address. lavi
J      .(j.e Welsh Town Planning and House Trust, Ltd., of 32, Park Place, Cardiff.Why Expert Help is Desirable.e\; These organisations (among others) are ready to &apos; supply copies of model rules which meet all the legal requirements.Some such expert help is desirable in drawing the rules of a Society because it is necessary to s f dude :-jujjj (1) Certain fixed rules needed to comply with the provisions of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act.i (2) Rules precisely explaining and governing the management and administration of the Society&apos;sbh(l     business, andif tl .lCd i (3) K-mes t0 carrY out tne requirements of the Local Government Board.Assifi A further advantage of consultation with a central 1 Wising organisation is that if registration is completed he tough one of them on the basis of its model rules, tsaving can be effected upon the fee for registration
charged by the registrar of friendly societqj whi^ normally is  5.once the promoters have completed these formaliti&apos;1 and have received from the registrar of friend societies an &quot; acknowledgment of registration,&quot; thl society is formed, and the eight persons who sign! the application for registration become its commit! of management until the first general meeting is hei when their positions may be confirmed or not.ii.help that public utility societies can obtaiuit now remains to explain what assistance towalj the building of working-class houses a public utilise society can obtain, and from whom.(2Two Sources of Help.a public utility society can obtain assistance fr^ two sources-either or both-namely, the governml and the local authority of its area-whether com council, town council or district council.10
ssista(^ from the Government.This help is of two kinds: itij (i) Loans of money, and adi (2) Money subsidies.any(1) LOANS.-Public Utility Societies have been able to borrow money from the State hitherto, it is true. But under the new arrangement they will be able to borrow much more. Their former powers of borrowing were limited to a sum equal to two-thirds of the value of the land and the houses they built. Under the new scheme it is proposed to allow them to borrow up to three-quarters of tlie cost of their land and buildings. With labour and material at its present prices, three-quarters of total cost is )Wal considerably more than two-thirds of total value, U^l for the &quot; market value &quot; of a house built to-day I    is by no njeans as high as the cost.(2) SUBSIDIES. In addition to making loans to Public Utility Societies the State will provide :e frfl   them also with subsidies.  These will be given rnml   in half-yearly payments, and each Society&apos;s Coujl   subsidy will be an amount equal to two-fifths of the charges for interest and gradual repayment u
of principal on the maximum amount wJch thS Society is entitled to borrow from the State-?! whether it borrow that amount from the State oi not. hAn Illustration. ^Thus, supposing a Society decided upon a buildim scheme to cost  40.000. and borrowed from the Staii three-quarters  of that  amount, namely,  S0!0Q!&apos;  Supposing, for the sake of example, that the rate a interest was 5I per cent, per annum.  Allowing ml gradual repayment in 50 yearly instalments, the year-^ charges for interest and repayment to be paid on thfj  30,000 loan would amount to roughly  1,770.  Tl$ Government subsidy to which the Society would fp entitled would bz two-fifths of this  1,770, namelS11  708 every year during the period cf repaymep31 leaving the balance of  1,062 and the charges on tjf01  10,000 capital privately subscribed, together with c$31 of management and upkeep, to be met?&apos;out of the rejfe of the houses built. 031tlThe subsidy, it will be noticed, amounts to a grantj, ^ roughly one-third of the total cost of the building schenfis,sMoreover, it must be remembered that a Socif F may not wish to use to the full extent its powers ftll( borrowing from the State.  It may well be ablePP0
gnbtainQnn members or other sources, such as banks, J housing societies, employers or others money at a Oiower rate of interest than that which the State will have to charge.  And herein is opened a way in which [a&quot; thrifty &quot; Society may reap a fuller advantage of the , state&apos;s subsidy proposals.  Though the Society borrow ir&apos;its money, or a part of it, at less than the interest ^charged by the State, it may still claim its yearly subsidy )0W the same basis as though it had borrowed three-fuarters of its capital from the State and were paying%e full Government rate o interest.arfty More precise details of the &quot; Financial Assistance jl Public Utility Societies &quot; which the Government is ^ Mepared to give, and the conditions under which it iefln be given, are explained in the Memorandum under ieJjat title issued by H.M. Stationery Office, Imperial t jouse, Kingsway, London, W.C. 2, as Command Paper JL price id., obtainable directly or through any book-rJler.  This should be read carefully by all persons pntempiating the building of houses under this scheme.iiei^s&apos;s&apos;ance ^rom i^oca&apos; Authorities.0CuJ Further assistance may be obtained from Local  rslthorities. The Housing Bill now before Parliament ^ejttpowers Local Authorities-whether County Councils,13
m1flbfIfluTown Councils, or District Councils to htLyin til1 formation of Public Utility Societies for the promotid of schemes for building working-class houses.   SubjeL to regulations of the Local Government Board, Lotjf Authorities may provide money for these Societies loan or free grant, may subscribe for shares or lot capital in them, or may act as guarantors of paymd of interest on the money borrowed by them from otlf sources.MlPrivate Capital. 91Though the assistance obtainable from these tfa sources will be most valuable in the formation: &apos; Public Utility Societies, and may open to nifty groups of working men and women a road towajpff the possession of homes of their own devising, the   yet remains something to be done in the way of self-h^ts Each Society must obtain from its members or fijpst private sources in the shape of loans, loan stock,fe &apos; shares, a reasonable proportion of its capital, equal! s&amp; at least one-third of the money borrowed or borrowlen from the State, i.e., one-quarter of the total cost of?1? housing scheme. Each Society must be prepared]-/7? rank its debt to the State as a &quot; first charge &quot; onf^ property, and its loan stock as coming before its skom capital for purposes of interest.

It must be prepared to charge fair and reasonable eats.  Further, it must hurry on with its building. The State&apos;s offer is made expressly to meet the problem if the urgent need for houses, and the high cost of jjuilding them, and is limited, therefore, to schemes which are carried out within two years of March 31st, ,919, or such further period as the Local Government ard may allow. onl; Societies which are prepared to fulfil these conditions mlay count on the readiest assistance and co-operation )waj)m me Government.

MEMORANDUMOP THELOCAL   GOVERNMENT   board in regardlto the Execution of Public Works (Exclusive of housing) by Local Authorities in England and Wales.It is clear from the number of questions recently addressed to the President of the Local Government Board and from the number of communications on the subject which have reached him, that considerable interest is being taken, both in Parliament and outside, in ihe question of the extent to which public works are being put in hand at the present time by Local Authorities.He thinks it desirable therefore, to publish a statement indicating the progress which is being made in this matter. The following particulars relating to the matters concerned are therefore supplied : i &amp; ii. Summaries, dated 28th January and 29th April respectively, of information mainly obtained by Engineering Inspectors of the Board from Local Authorities with whom they have conferred upon the execution of public works.iii. Comparative Table showing periodical increases in the cost of works in progressat the time of the Inspectors visits, and of works fully authorised together with certain other figures useful for puposes of comparison.iv. Statement showing in summarised form [a) the applications of Local authorities for sanctions to loans received by the Local Government Board in each week from that ended on the 28th January, 1919, to that ended on the 29th April, 1919, and (5) the amounts sanctioned by the Local Government Board in each week during the same period.The Local Authorities with whom Inspectors of the Board have conferred and to whom Statements i, ii and iii, relate, numbered, up to the 29th April, 766, and included County and Town Councils, Urban and Rural District Councils, and Joint Boards, in ali parts of the country. .In considering the figures it must be borne in mind that one half of the Local Authorities of England and Wales have not yet been visited, and that the Statements do not, therefore, give anything like a complete picture of the works in progress at the time.It must also be remembered.that in addition to the money obtained from loans, Local Authorities are now spending large sums out of revenue, including in many cases savings from rates collected in excess of expenditure during the War and invested to meet the emergency works which it was foreseen would have to be undertaken on the conclusion of the War.The figures in the Statements are interesting both from the point of view of the revival of industry, which is assisted by many of the works undertaken by Local Authorities, and also from the point of view of the prevention of unemployment.As regards the first point, attention must be drawn to the fact that in most cases works carried out by Local Authorities necessitate the production of manufactured goods in other parts of the Country. Electricity, gas, sewerage and waterworks are examples which readily occur to the mind. Consequently, the benefit as regards the revival of industry is by no means confined to the neighbourhood of the area of the Local Authority executing the works.Or
For the same reason the statement, frequently made, that works undertaken by Local Authorities are often unsuitable for the employment of the persons who are unemployed, must be received with caution. It is perfectly true that cotton spinners, textile workers, lacemakers, and many others cannot to any large extent be remuneratively employed on road work or other strenuous manual labour, or without some possible loss of efficiency in their own trade. But, as already pointed out; the effect of putting works in hand cannot properly be looked at from (&quot;his restricted point of view.The Local Government Board have been for some time in communication with the Treasury on the subject of the removal of the embargo by that Department on the lo;ms of Local Authorities, and from time to time various concessions in that direction were secured.On the 2nd of April, the Treasury informed the Board that the remaining restrictions on borrowing by Local Authorities in the open market were removed. A circular letter to Local Authorities informing them of this was therefore issued.This decision on the part of the Treasury will have a material effect in facilitating the execution of works by Local Authorities. High prices and scarcity of materials will still remain as retarding influences, but a perusal of the Statements now published suggests that these influences are not operating to such a serious extent as is sometimes supposed. The Statement of loans sanctioned by the Board each week from that ended the&apos; 28th January last inclusive, indicates a material increase of activity on the part of Local Authorities.Attention should also be drawn to the fact that whilst the largest loans are being sanctioned in respect of electricity, gas and roads works so essential for securing the commercial interests of the Country an analysis of the loans sanctioned shows a remarkable variety of work about to be undertaken, including water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal, works of sea defence, the provision of schools, cemeteries, tractors, scavenging plant, etc.In order that the Board may be kept informed of the putting in hand of works carried out by means of money borrowed with their sanction, they have, recently asked every Local Authority receiving such sanction to report to them when the work is put in hand.   Sanctions are given on the condition that the work is begun immediately.H. C. MONRO.Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W.1.Secretary,(23086.)   Wt. 4051-300.  2000.   5/19.   D &amp; S   Gr. 2.
