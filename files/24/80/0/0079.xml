Returns have now been received &quot;from 36 guilty Councils shDwing that &quot;&quot;of 13,499 applicants for small holdings 852 have boon interviewed.     Of the number interviewed 5.314 (or c6%) Jive boon approved.     The approved applicants comprise;-3,168 who require small holdings amounting to     59,039 aores, and 146 who require cottage holdings amounting to      610-5&quot; acres,The above figures differ in severalmspodts from -what was aticipatod a few months ago.     In the first piaoe, enquiries made cn 2haif of the Board among tho trocpo- in Franco three or four months ago [iggetitod that a largo proportion of the applications received would ttfKor Cottage Holdings.     It wasa also thought that a large number cfservice men with little cr no experience of agriculture and no fcpital would send in applications for cottage and small holdings. s?.ther of these forecasts have proved to be true.     The figures just liven are confirmed by reports from the Board&apos;s officers in most frts of the country, which state that a very high proportion of tho plicanta are possessed cf both practical experience and a fair amount
fa U ifcf capital.    More-over, the applicants arc to a,very largo extent men who desire to obtain thoir whole livelihood from cultivating their holding, and not, as was previously thought, men who intended earning wages as agricultural labourers, or in some other industry, but were desirous of obtaining a cottage with a small piece of land attached.Speaking generally, it may be stated that the tctal number of applicati. ons recfjivod is .less than was expected.    On the other hand the proportion of applicants approved after being intervieirT&amp;d (C&amp;fo) is so high that the net number for whom small /holdings will have to be provided is quite as large as was anticipate;&apos;..In the case of County Boroughs, the number of applicants:.r.&apos;.tervicv:ed is not yet sufficient to enable any deduction to bs drawn as to the compaiative demand for small and cottage holdings, and for the present no analysis can be given of the   applications received by the Councils of County Boroughs.Land Settlement.r through.

AllotmentsiRetention of I-and acQuired under _p_.Q_jR._A.     A number of difficult problems&quot;&quot;have been submitted to the Xocjrd by Local Authorities with regard to land cultivated as allotments cf which the owner desires to resume&apos;immediate possession.-     The Board, have, therefore, sent tc all -Allotment Authorities a statement cf their policy in this matter.
The Board have pointed out that while the retention of land as allotments cannot he permitted to restrict the development cf a town, or to prevent the erection of houses, factories, works, etc., they consider that no land cultivated as allotments should be given up for building purposes until immediately before building operations begin.     Authorities have, therefore, been asked t-- &quot;satisfy thymsolvcs that the plans  &apos;.f buildings have been approved by the L-eal Authority, and that the building material is available t - commence the mrk. Councils have also been instructed to notify applicants f-r possession that if building operations do not commence within one month of the date from which possession is given the Council will have to consider whether they should not exercise their compulsory powers for the acquisition of the land.In cases where the owner proposes to sell the property cither by private treaty or public auction, or to lease it, he often desires to resume possession for the purpose, and in some cases owners hare stated that they were prepared to continue to cultivate the land ponding its disposal.     In such cases Councils have been advised to give a written undertaking to the owner that if the property is sold . or agreed to be leased they will be prepared to give up possession to the purohaser or person entitled to the agreement as soon as he re-quires immediate possession of the land for building or industrial purposes, subject to the safe-guards outlined in the preceding para-graph .(iv)   Tithe, Commons,n[ Copyhold and JSurrey^.Arrangements have been made for the representation of the case for the Regulation of Ccity Wall!a&apos;Commons in tho County ef Glamorgan before the Select Committee of the House of Commons which has been set up to consider the hoard&apos;s Provisional Order under the Commons Act, 1876 in the matter.The Board continue to receive from landowners, desiring to redeem tithe rentcharge, compllints as to the obstacles plao-in their way by the tithe collectors .    Among these is one fron. the Surveyor to tho London United Tramways Ltd., and the Metro-politan Electric Tramways Ltd.      These Companies are the owners of certain lands in the Parishes of Finchley, Tottenham, Baling and Hanwell, which are subject to small tithe rentcharges payable to the respective Hectors of the Parishes.Application was made tc the firm of Tithe Agents, who collect the whole of these tithe rentchargeu, for information a3 to rates payable, land tax.payable, cost of collection, etc.     All information was, however, refused, the Companies being informed that cn payment of the fee the Agents themselves would be prepared to carry cut the redemption.   vThe Surveyor paints out that the tithe rentcharge in these cases was small and to have to pay fees q  to third parties dees away with all incentive to landowners to redeem tho charges.     The lieard hays arranged to obtain, them-selves, the necessary particulars from the local Rating Authorities and Land Tax Commissioners without reference to the tithe collectors.

At a moderate computation the manurial value of the excrements of the population of the United Kingdom has been estimated at nearly  18,000,000 per annum, but hitherto only a email fraction of this value has been recovered.     Recently,   A however, sewage chemists have evolved a method of treating sewage      j which eeeme to open up the possibility of better utilisation.    Thie .\\ method is being carefully investigated at Rothamsted:   an experimental unit has been set up at the Harpenden Sewage Wo vies, and the sludge produced ie being subjected to careful field and laboratory tests.Possibility ef,Using Poison Gases in Agriculture and Horticulture. Experiments, are in progress to utilise :Tn agriculture &quot;poiBen gases,&quot;&quot; or.their constituents.   &apos; The meet promising direction appears   to be as applications to soils ridden with pasts or disease germs such as cause considerable trouble in intensive culture under glass, and experiments ate in progress at the Rothamsted laboratories and in large commercial glasshouses at Harpenden and Waltham Cross,Plant PiseBsee -   The reports for April submitted by the Plant Disease Correspondents of the Technical Committee have been summarised. A few of the move interesting cases may be noted.     As regards cereals, slight damage was Teported from Yorkshire to a crop of winter wheat by attacks of JWheat^BuJLb^Ply. and by l^it^fly.     In the latter case the two fields Attacked &quot;were&quot;&quot; next to a plot on&quot; which oats were grown last year. In another field ploughed out of grass and planted with potatoes in 1918, wireworms have seriously damaged the wheat, a patch of about an acre being practically destroyed,     Samples of &quot;seed&quot; potatoes suffering from Skin Spot oontinue to be received in large numbers, In many cases complaints are ra&amp;de that the eyes have been damaged end killed,     Although the eyes av*e often killed it doee not follow that the fungus is always responsible, even in badly affected tubers.     The varieties noted affected are King Edward, British Queen, Pioneer, Sharpens Express, Arran Chief, Duke of York, and Up-to-Date, and in ti large number of cases the seed is said to have come direct from Scotland.     The Board have received a detailed report as to the occurrence of Covky^jscab in gardens in the county of Lancashire.    The distribution of sune of&quot;the most serious cases is given.     The disease occurs principally on heavy loaai and clay and there is evidence to shew that it increases in intensity each time jgotstoes are grown in infected soil.     In certain localities where pr Latoes have been repeatedly planted the disease is so bad that it is no longer profitable to grow this crop,   As regards vegetable pests, it ie reported that a large number of tomatoes hf ve&quot;&quot;be&apos;en lost in the Cheddar Valley district and in Northumberland from a cause not yet determined.

The highest acreage ,,was again dealt with in Anglesey where 20 tractors ploughed 96 acres and cultivated 768, average 4*8 acres and 38.4 acres respectively.During the week the proposals of the WestmorlandCommittee for the retention of a proportion of their tractors alter the end of this month were approved.    The Cardigan Committee is now the only one that has not yet submitted proposals,    The number of Tractors to be retained after the end of May is now approximately 1350 out of 4050.Mechanical Section.Complaints have been received as to the difficultiesin the way of importing spare parts.    The Department ef Import Restrictions have arranged to grant licences to import spare parts for agricultural machinery subject to a guarantee that they will be utilised only for replacement purposes on foreign machinery. i\During the week ended 24th May, returns of saleshave been forwarded by Warwick, Derby, Somerset, Montgomery, Northants, Northumberland, Lancashire, East Sussex, Essex, Devon, Lincoln (Holland), -//orcester, City of Birmingham,Bedford, Cumberland and Carmarthen.

Up to date 370 sales have been held for which 326 returns have been submitted.    73 further sales have been arranged.Sales still continue to be well patronized and to yield good prices*     In Nottingham a Clayton Tractor has been sold for  436, a tfordson for  220 and a Titan for  215. Threshing Iniachinery sold at Bideford, Tavistock, Spalding and Worcester realised about cost price.     Nottingham Agricultural iUxocutive Committee have sold two threshing machines at cost price to farmers and Contractors who will, retain and work them in the County.    The results of sales afford valuable information as to the implements and machinery most popular and suitable in each district.Her-ee Section.The total number of horses sold to date amounts to 6,800, 1,600 of these being cast horses.     The other 5,300 were all in good working condition and have realised  340,000.Details of the sale of 630 horses by the 31st May have yet to be reported.Arrangements have been made to sell 1,200 horses in June, but information is still awaited from Borne of the Counties which will probably bring the total up to about 2,000. The total number of horses to be retained until the 30th September is not likely to exceed 1,500.A considerable number of the horses to be retained until after the harvest include horses solely employed in transporting Prisoners of tfar to and from their work, and it is expected that when the Prisoners are repatriated, these . horses will be immediately disposed of. .Ho steps have been taken to send any of the mares still in the poseesoion of the Board to the horse, as very few, if any, of the mares which were selected for breeding purposes, remain in the Board&apos;s possession.     It was felt that as these sales were proceeding so quickly, purchasers could make their own arrangements in this, respect,Grass keep has be*n taken in all those Counties where it is proposed to keep horses until the end cf September on the same terms as last year.The stock\ of harness at the Depot is being disposed of as quickly as possible,    A further sale by Messrs.

Some of the demands which were anticipated owing to the withdrawal of soldiers have not materialised and there are others which it ie anticipated will probably be made when the date is fixed for the withdrawal of the German prisoners.     It is difficult to recruit women for so uncertain a demand,450 women have been asked for in the Holland Division of Lincoln,     It ha3 been decided only to send 150 until further negotiations have been satisfactorily settled with the employers. This 150 will be billeted centrally and will start work on June 14th. IA further 400 women will be required from the second week in July to pull flax in Huntingdon.     They will live in empty . cottages and billets, and marquees will be set up as mess tent3.Two resolutions were passed last week at a meeting of representatives of the Women1s War Agricultural Committees of all Wales to the effect (!) that the billeting rate fixed by the Agricultural Wages,Board for the various districts is too low and compares unfavourably with the billeting rate outside the farmhouse;    (2) that the same billeting race should bo fixed throughout Zngland and Wales, as at- present women naturally prefer to work wheie the billeting rate is lowest and the real wage received is higher in proportion.Good reports of the work done by women motor tractor drivers continue to be received.femes Institutss.      18 Institutes were started during the week,&quot;&quot;making.IPtotal of 1,079.
