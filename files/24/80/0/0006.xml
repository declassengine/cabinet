Idii        q&quot; 8 &quot; 10SUMMARYThe most important event of the week has been the landing of Esthonian troops under British guns near Narva.    As the Soviet Government is reported to have been contemplating the evaouation of Petrograd in July, it seems probable that no effort will be made to hold the oity.In France there has been a lull in revolutionary activities, and the Frenoh are taking steps towards repatriating some 17,000 Russian troops and civilians to Odessa.In Belgium there is an improvement in the Labour situation.The reoapture of Munich and the precarious position of the Soviet Government in Hungary has depressed the Communists throughout Germany.    In Berlin the Officers of Noske^ Army have restored strict discipline and are to be seen swaggering about in uniform with their swords, in the old pre-War fashion.There are complaints that the Czechs are distributing the Allied supplies of food unfairly.    On May 13th the Cabinet at Prague resolved, with the support of the 3ooiallst Minister, to take drastio action against the Bolsheviks in the event of disorder.In/
- 2 -In Hungary Bela Kun 1 s Government has beoome stronger sinoe the Roumanian Army oeased to advance.    A oounter-revolutionary Government has been formed at Brad for the purpose of overthrowing the Bolsheviks and establishing Democraoy. -...India iB quiet internally&quot;and on the frontier, but a large quantity of Bolshevik propaganda is finding its way to Kashgar, where a notorious Bolshevik agent has been arrested.In Spain the Military Censorship has temporarily suppressed Bolshevik propaganda.Egypt is quiet, but there is a widespread strike in the Canal zone.    The Soudanese have potdtiutied not to be handed over to the Egyptians.    The tfgyptiari Delegation in Faris is disseminating false reports of outrages by British soldiers.The Japanese are reported to be secretly working behind the Bolsheviks in the United States and in&apos;Russia, and to have engaged ten German Submarine Officers for the Navy and German Military Offioers for the toy. &apos;&apos;In the United States the negroes have.beoome restless.The Sduth African Nationalist Delegation is described to be little more than &quot;u-vote^catohing&apos;expedient&quot;. &apos;Anti-Bolshevik placards are said to have been effeotive in North Italy.      \ *&quot; , &apos;
FEMC33- mil-Mi m - - - -* MlitWThe genera], opinion of the advanced Socialist Press, is that President Wilson, has been overbidden by the British and. French Pre.mj.ors;   that the. Terms &apos;.of the Treaty are ^Imperialistic and provocative of international strife in the future&apos;.    Generally speaking, there&apos; is not much enthusiasm &apos;.&apos;      about the peace Terms, and people are inclined to grumbleabout the financial provisions as&apos;pressing hardly upon France.In the Chamber-,&quot;the&apos; vote of confidence in the Government on the Socialist interpellation&apos;of Caohin was accepted by ,356 votes to 1,    The Socialists,are greatly disappointed at the weakness shown by their Deputies, and are renewing their violent attacks upon Monsieur Clemenoeau.&apos;   The strike of Stock Exchange and Bank employees, which began on the 5th May, oontinues.     The strikers demand the recognition of their Union, a minimum wage, and a pension. Speaking generally, however, the Labour situation is calmer, and there is a decrease of propaganda among the working classes.    Food prides show a 3light downward-&apos;tendency, though ., the cost ,of living i.s still excessive,, Except in respeot of the delay in the settlement of pay and gratuities, the morale&apos;of the French Army continues to be satisfactory.,.,,    * , &apos; &apos;.&apos;&apos; The troops, returning from Odessa had a large number of Bolshevik leaflets, and pamphlets, but it now appears that they used them, as a&apos; saf e.-opnduot in. the territory occupied by the Bolsheviks, and. that,they have -brought them horns merely as souvenirs.....      \ &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos; .., &apos;.,; . ;&apos;-&apos;it is interesting to find .that the French Authorities have discovered no evidence of enemy influence in revolutionary circles, nor&apos; of &quot;any &quot;increase in revolutionary funds in France..,, -:        .,:   &apos; ,.. v;:.t. &apos;:.&apos; ,......     The/
(Foreign)&apos; - 2 - I&quot;The Egyptian Delegation suooeeded in buying one or two - Deputies and oertain extreme newspapers, and have been heard to oomment with surprise upon the cheapness of Deputies as compared with the other things one buys in Paris.    The Frenoli Government has now undertaken to suppress the publication of all information about Egypt of an anti-British charaoter. &apos;  The Delegation have been showing photographs of allegedBritish atrooiiies. Specimens of these photographs have been; received, and their authenticity is being investigated.The Frenoh Socialist Party proposes to send a Delegation, headed by the Deputy Renaudel, to confer with British Socialists on the subjeot of Allied, intervention in Russia, a S revision of the Peaoe Terms - which are considered too imperialistic - and other questions.BELGIUM.The publication of the Peace Terms has, to some extent,  I silenced the oritioisms against England and Amrioa whioh wert common in the. Press and among the public during the past fortnight, though there is still a residuum of ill-feeling-against Great Britain,   The anti-British policy in a section of the Belgian Press suggests that there is a seoret influence at work behind it.    Anti-British artioles have appeared in different papers on the same date, in differing   1 terms, but praotically identical in substance.    The statement! contained in them have had so long a start that it would be difficult to overtake them by counter-propaganda, though then! are suggestions that a Propaganda Agenoy might still be established in Belgium with advantage to British interests.  IThe Labour situation is very much relieved, and if the j rate of exchange were to improve, it is thought that there   !would/1
(Foreign) - 3 -would be a quick trade recovery.   There is now very littlediscontent among Municipal or State employees.    The most active movement at the moment is in Flanders, where the Socialists and Catholios are fighting for the Flemish vote.Although certain of the prominent Swiss Bolshevists think that Germany is a safer country to be in than theirown, nevertheless several Gorman Bolshevists have reoentlyfled to Switzerland from Germany..    fiiohhom.. formerly policepresident in Berlin, is reported to be amongst the number,and is believed to have brought with him considerable sums ofmoney for propaganda in Switzerland,On April-23th an orderly meeting took place among bankemployees to discuss certain grievances against their employers, but unfortunately the military wer$ instructed to intervene.    This incident has been the subjeot of muchadverse comment, and has been made full use of by the extremists,The following in the form of a printed pamphletpublished by the. &apos;Zurcher volkzeitung&apos; has been received from switzerland-ffla/bten1 s true picture.^Aooording to statements of Swiss people who,while undergoing 11 days quarantine at Terioki on their return from Russia, were lodged in the same house asPlatten, the latter expressed his views on the Russian,,. situation as follows&quot;Suoh a miserable Government as at present exists in Russia oannot hold out muoh longer;, it will defeat its own ends.    I have now ,    oonvinoed myself that Bolshevism from apraotioal point of view is impossible.   Lenin is&apos;a fanatic but his associates are robbers . and murderers&quot;.The pamphlet then goes on to show how this attitude ofPlatten&apos;s/
Platten&apos;s is only a cloak under which to hide his true charaot er.The Swiss Consul at Helsingfors has been disavowed by the Federal Government for his intervention on behalf of Flatten and Axelrod.    It is thought that Flatten may attempt to return to Switzerland to serve his sentence and so pose as a martyr.A large number of volunteers have enrolled themselves for the purpose of carrying on vital services in the event of another general strike.-...-The recapture of Munich and the precarious position of  Ithe 3oviet Government in Hungary is having its effect on the jI&apos;   Communists throughout Germany.South Western Germany has not yet, however, reached the end of her troubles.    Munich has become, to the Bavarians, a unpopular capital; the presence of Prussian Auxiliary Troops is looked upon with suspicion and the Extremist Hoffmann and his party do not enjoy the support of the Bavarian State nor ! the sympathy of other parts of Germany.In Berlin the situation is rapidly assuming pre-war oonditions.    The Officers of Noske^s Army, whioh is really controlled by General Groener, have succeeded in restoring discipline.   The men salute, and the Offleers are now to be seen in uniform with their swords and their general swaggerifl carriage.    There are reports of meetings of Officers1 Corps,&apos; and there are general indications that the Military Party is beginning again to rear its head.a meeting of the Offioials and Teachers&apos; Association of Bavaria and Augsburg on May 5th, it was stated that all supplies of foreign products still left would be exhaustedjuiy
(Foreign) . -&apos; 5 -        - -.   , -July,- and that national bankruptcy was imminent.The German-Press has been at some pains to contrast the quietude of Berlin With the disorders which took plaoe on the 1st. May in Paris, Madrid and Cleveland.In the: British zone of occupation&quot; the. Bourgeois and Conservative elements show some- resentment at the easy-going&apos; temper of the British Authorities, whilst, on the other hand, the industrial work people are surprised at the facilities granted for demonstrations.    There appears to be a&apos;general movement in1schools to teach the children that they must, look forward to a day of revenge, and their present plight is only a temporary one.The treatment of the Russian prisoners in Germany is said to point W&apos;a&apos; deliberate policy of contaminating all the Russians that come into the hands of the German Government with Bolshevism.    Further reports have been reoeived that the German Propaganda Service is at work: another notorious agent has appeared in Geneva.German financial agents at the Hague state that Messrs. Henderson and Ramsay Haodonald assured their German comrades at the oooialist Conference that the Peaoe Terms might be toned down.   They owned that the Terms would be severe, but urged their comrades to do nothing rash, as there would be plenty of time for negotiation.AUSTRIA.      -  -   - :&apos;&apos;;j^&apos;IV;---^v-;&apos;:,:;;;ii::-Bohemia,    The eoonomio effect of the occupation of German Bohemia by Cseoh troops is becoming serious.    In dis-tributing provisions the agents of the Czeoh Government give -   preferential treatment to Czech districts in Bohemia, and ignore the claims of German Bohemia.    There is besides ruthleas&apos;requisitioning &quot;In the agricultural and cattle-breeding districts by Czech troops.The/
Foreign) 6 -The provisions sent by the Entente are reported to be insufficient and certain&apos; districts are described as being in a state of famine.    These conditions are a most favourable soil&apos; for Bolshevism, and the Communist Party has issued a proclamation urging the people to revolt.    It is suggested that the Allies should take over the distribution of the provisions supplied by them.On way 13th, the Cabinet at Prague resolved, with the support of the Socialist Minister, to take drastic aotion against the Bolsheviks in the event of disorder.UKGAflY.Owing to the indeoision of the Allies, and the faot that the Roumanian Army has ceased to advance, BHIA ICUN&apos;s . Government have decided to remain in power.    The Government . has gradually got stronger and   its organisation   is Improving.     It is very unpopular, but expressions of disagreement are mercilessly punished.Small counter-revolutions are constantly breaking out is the country distriots but are quickly suppressed by Ked troops.,The Hungarian Army is reported to be mainly anti-Communist, and would refuse to fight against any offensive of the Allies.The peasants are refusing to send food to the towns, as they are not in sympathy with the movement, ^nd there is famine in Budapest. \Outside Budapest the people are said to favour a Britiej oooupation.Budapest is desoribed as being a dead city with olostd shops.    The Americans report that at a meeting of the Centra Soviet, Bela Kun stated that the working men are divided into two groups:   the largest group refuses to defend Budapest
and considers the situation so desperate that all saorifioe 1 would be useless; the second group would defend the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, and in case of failure would retreat by way of the Bakny Woods to Wiener Heustadt.A Counter-Revolutionary Hungarian Government has been formed at Brad, under leadership of Count Julius Karolyi; twelve ministers are associated with him in manifest.    The Government regards itself ?m only temporary, with the purpose of overthrowing the Bolshevik regime in Budapest and the establishment of democracy,Bukovina is reported to be quiet, food is sufficient and good crops are expected.    On the whole, the population-is said to be anti-Iioumanian.ITALY.    -The wave of Bolshevism which originated in MILAH and was assuming an alarming oh&amp;r&amp;cter, has been considerably checked by the work of the Milan vnti-Bol3hevist Association, The work of this Association has been carried out in the form of placards giving cietallo of all Bolshevist crimes.    These placards -vre posted in the streets and the effeot on the workpeople and particularly on the women, is said to have been very great,Bolshevism appears to have had no sucoess with the Military.Labour unrest appears probable but Bolshevism has . undoubtedly decreased and is no longer a menace.greece. &apos;     vThough there is no indication that the Bolshevik Party in Greece is increasing, the industrial situation is oritical.    Prices are very high, and enormous wages are being demanded.    The Royalists, who financed and encouraged the/
(Foreign) - 8 -the movement on May Day, are muoh depressed at the failure of the demonstration and at the strong Military measures te&amp; by the Government.CZECHO-SLOVAK STATJBS.The Hungarian bolsheviks have been distributing pamphlets in Slovak territory, inoiting the soldiers to establish Soviets.   The documents point out that the Hungarian Republio has reoognised autonomy for the Slovaks by the law of the 11th March, 1919, and that the working classes will profit by seizing upon the capitalists&apos; wealth as soon as a &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; has been established.RUSSIA.1It is reported from an American souroe that the Soviet Government is advising the people of Petrograd to leave the city as the Government will evacuate it after the 1st July. All intercourse between Soviet ;tossia and the Neva area will then oease.    This advice was apparently given before it was I known that the Finns were about to advonoe at Xaskolovo. The situation in the large factories in and about Petrogrud is pitifulj most of the workmen, who have not. been mobilised for the Red Army, have drifted aWay, being unable any longer to submit to the intolerable food situation.    Only a residuuf of uneduo^ted labourers, whose sole wish is to do  as little work for :.s much pay as possible, remains,xiailv/ay transport will soon be at a standstill for laok of fuel and rolling-stock.    The only commodity whioh is plentiful is war a&amp;terial.   The Ukraine -t on which the Soviet Government relied for food supplies, has ff.ifl.ed it for lack of transport..    In Petrogr/id, people appear ,u be indifferent to/
to passing events;   their personal Bufferings occupy their whole minds and they can take no interest in the privations of their friends.    The situation in moscow is said to be worse even than in Petrogr, d.it a Session of the Council of Peoples Commissioners in Petrograd on the 6th my, Trotsky declared that, &quot;The  astern Front is in imminent danger i.s Koltohak is at present succeeding in organising all the counter-revolutionary forces.    The propaganda of wenahevik and revolutionary Socialist traitors is very active in the Lorth :,nd renders the people defiant towards the Soviet power&quot;,Revolts among the peasants have become more frequent during the last few months, and Trotsky has threatened severe punishment to the Local Soviets and Committees of poor peasants who have failed to maintain order.Insurrections in the rear of the Hod Army are very frequent.    On the Bast err: Front, the fteds have to retreat the whole time through a hostile country.    The rear of the. Archangel Front is also f.*r from quiet.It is interesting to note th-t the Tomsk Semitio Society has placed  100,000 at the disposal of Koltchak for the needs of the Vray and  5,000 at the disposal of the -   educational section of the Army.    According to the report of the Ministry of Finance the revenue reoeived by Koltchak&apos;s Government keeps on increasing.    January, February and March, 1919, brought in  31,488,900.Aided by Finnish Volunteers, the Karelians have succeeded in freeing their country from the Bolsheviks.They h:vve established a provisional Assembly at Oldneta,whioh, owing to luck of suitable Karelians, is composedentirely of Finns.    It is proposed to form a national government at Olonetz as soon as possible.    This assembly is to be composed as far as possible of Karelians.    Thequestion of independence or union with Finland is to bediscussed,/
. discussed.    The Finns deny emphatically that they are trying to annex Karelia-, or mix theasolvea up in Russian politics.4 senior official of the Salvation ;moy, vthioh is regarded by the Bolsheviks, an a oountor-revolutionary organisation, has state in a letter th:*t human flesh has been offered  -or. sale in the market place in Mosoow,A report, which must bo accepted with /^reat reserve, repeats the xnwysc, tliat the Military Party in Germany has concluded a formal agreement with Japan and the Soviet Government-, und^r which Germany is.to re-organise European Russia, and Japan, asiatio Russia,.    While Russia provides Germany with food and personal for the -Army,&apos; Japan ::nd Germany are to spread ,Bolshevism in EnglandFrance and the British colonies.Food conditions are fair, but prices are very high. The country ia in great need of manufactured-commodities and of raw materials..The present Government is apparently stable and strong, The newly elected Diet is practically agreed upon the establishment of a Republic, but the form oi the constitution is still under debate..   . The Bolsheviks appear to have been crushed, for the Finnish Socialists are not Bolshevik, and the danger of Russian Bolshevists over-running the oountry is more remote since the Esthonians launched their offensive at Kaskolovo and iterva.The Finnish troop3 state that,they.are fighting for the liberation of the Kwrelians.     The, f eelin-.,;: on the Front has become notioeably pro-Uly, though a small pro-Germ.:n groupremains.

One correspondent says that&apos;.he oannot write at length on the causes of the rebellion &quot;for fear of vindictiveness on the part of our discredited Bureauorats&quot;.The most serious event of the week has been the strike on the Sues Canal, whioh is extending to all trades in the &apos;- &quot;zone,&apos; inoludi^g the cigarette makers. 1&apos; Though the causes of the strike are said to be economic, it is impossible to believe that they are not to be looked for among those who are engineering the general Moslem unrest.    On the other hand, oommunioaticns are beginning to be opened up in the Delta, though some time must elapse before they are normal, owing to the damage to rolling stook and the prolonged strike.There are prospects of forming a Ministry within the &apos;&quot;&apos; next few days..   In the meantime native officials are oarrying on their work adequately under British control.The Soudanese are disturbed by the fear that the British may leave the Scudah and hand them over to the Egyptians, and the Soudanese religious leaders have written two letters to the Governor General emphatically dis^assooiating themselves from the Nationalist aotivity in jSgypt.-   These letters are quite spontaneous and representative of the Soudanese generally.
