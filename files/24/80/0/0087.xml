YTEHM-V .&apos;        From Viceroy, Foreign Department, lsi^the  1919.(Received 1st June, 2 p.m.)     ,, *Clear the line.Secret. Afghanistan. Following from Maffey, Chief Political Officer with General Barratt, dated Peshawar, 5.20 p.m., 31st May : &quot; Letter from Amanulla to Viceroy, dated 28th May just received. Full transla-tion follows by wire.   Rough impression of first verbal translation as follows : &quot; &apos; Cur fear of disorders in India led us to take steps to protect Afghan border. This led to mistakes on both sides. Our soil was invaded and we had to fight. But Abdur Rahman gathered in Simla-that British Government did not want war. We therefore asserted by proclamation Jehad and our National Council decided that Envoy again be deputed to explain matters and stop bloodshed. Nevertheless your aeroplane bombed Jalalabad and Kabul Royal Palace and tomb of my forefathers. Our regret is great to see British copying German example. In spite&quot;of all we do not wish old friendship to be broken and enmity grow through bloodshed. This friendly letter proves our good intentions. We have sent instructions to commanders to stop hostilities and movements of troops. Certified copies of orders enclosed. With the greatest sincerity I inform Your Excellency my Government never intended severance of friendship. We desire an honourable peace useful to both parties. Matters may be settled in this way that some personage from both sides be selected to meet at Landi Kotal or Peshawar for discussion and for settlement and the sooner the better for both parties.&apos;&quot; Tone of letter is a satisfactory climb down.&quot;
