INDUSTRY o &apos;Memorandum by the President of the Board (if Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland,1. As authorised by the War Cabinet on the 22nd May (XJ,0,570Min.l) we have communicated to the members of the Herring fishing Industry the offer of assistance contained in the War Cabinet&apos;s decision as follows:-&quot;If on 15th September, 1919, there should be no market &amp;s only such market as involves errors in a loos, the Government *?oul&amp; be prepared to share the lyes equally with the curers on a limited bar-collage,&quot;2. A working scheme (set tut fully in app.A.) has been drawnup in accordance with that decision.     Its essential features are;-(l)   A limited barrelage of 400,000.(2) Tho cost of the various Qualities of cured fish to be reckoned at scheduled rates subject to reduction if a reasonable price is not paid to tho fishermen for the fresh fish,(3)   Allowance for cost of cure to be fixed at 25/- per barrel which will leave the curer nothing for profit, interest on capital or personal remuneration and may involve him in loss.(4)   Zi at 13th September, 1919, herrings covered by the scheme have been sold at a loss or remain unsold, one half of tho curer&quot;s deficit will bo paid to him by the Government,3, This scheme has been discussed with a duly authorisedrepresentative of the industry.     The members of the industry greatly appreciate the consideration 7/ith which the War -Cabinet hove received their request and fully recognise that the offer of assistance made by the Government is intended to meet the exceptional difficulties of the industry.,     They agree also that tho machinery of the above mentioned scheme is, generally speaking, the best vrhich can be devised upos the given prino,iples*4* It is, however, their considered opinion, that the scheme will not achieve the object to which it is directed, namely, the prevention of a collapse of the fishing.     Their reason is that it will not enable the, curoro to finance their operations, upon which the continued emplojTnent of the fishermen depends65, Under present conditions the curer requires far morecapital than formerly.     fresh herrings (his principal raw. naterial) cost, on the average, twice as much as in 1914, because the fisher... men&amp; expenses are enormously increased.     Barrels and salt cost i    respectively three and four times as much as in 1914.     for the same volume of business therefore the ourer must employ more than twice, as much capital as previously,G. Moreover the curero (most of whom have little free working capital) could not get the usual credit from the Banks on their stocks, evon if, as proposed, the Government undertook to chare * equally in any loss.     The Banks formerly lent on the strength of an early and assured market,     Tho Government*s undertaking to Dhr.ro in a loss would not, we fear, be an effective substitute.
In considering pvactical alternatives *?e adorrt the principle of a limited barvelagy which is workable though with some difficulty.     Instead of a aliasing of lose we have been compelled to fall back on the principle of a guarantee modified, however, so as ti meet the criticism that our former rcrcajosalo mi&amp;ht leave the error with a possible margin of profit if the guarantee became optative.0,, Accordingly an alternative has been drafted with thefollowing main fea turee:-(l)   A limited b^rrelage of 400,000*(2)   Purchase by the Government at scheduled prices up to the limit of 400,000 barrels if the closure of l^i&quot;eign markets prevents tho stock from being disposed of by the 15th September, 1919 .(3)   Reduction of the scheduled prices, if a reasonable price is not paid to the fishermen for the f-^esh fish.(4)   Allowance for cost of cure to be 20/- per barrel, whioh will leave the curor nothing for profit, interest on capital, or personal remuneration, and may involve him in loss09, A serious situation has already arisen owing to the inability of the curers to commence operations.     prices last week fell far below the fishermen&apos;s working expenses and large quantities of herring were thrown into the sea,     Iftery effort will he made by our Departments, (supported we believe by the leading ttfpr* &amp; e nta tive e of the industry), to prevent repetitions of this depIsraels waste of food.    We are satisfied, however, that the only alternatives are (l) that the boats should discontinue fishing, which in our view would be disastrous, or (g) that arrangements should be made ta enable the curers to cure the surplus catch.,0, Por the reasons which we have stated we urgently recommend the adoption of the proposals mentioned in Par. 9, briefly(l)   A guarantee to buy, if requested, at the 15th September,1919, stocks then undisposed of within a limit of 400,000 barrels.(2)   The prices t^ be such that the curer wha sells to theGovernment under the guarantee must necessarily lose all chance of profit, interest on his capital, cr remuneration for his own services:   und may incur a further loss on the actual curing.ROBERT MUNRO.[I

Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph,the    ;cost to the curer for the various Selections and Qualities shall be reckoned as at the 15th September, 1919, in accordance with the appended scheduled rates.4. Should it he found on making up a valuation at the scheduled rates of a cureT&apos;s total cure for the season from 1st June to 15th September, 1919, that after allowing for the cost of the green fish he would be left with a margin for cost of cure in excess of 26/- per barrel, completed ready for market, the rates at which the coEit of the various Selections and Qualities is to be reckoned shall be the scheduled rates reduced by the amount of &amp;uch excess.MACHINERY.5.
