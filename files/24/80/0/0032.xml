WAR   CABINET.i^^^ Owing to the failure of the local supply of Tibben due to recent disturbances and the reluctance on the part of Egyptian farmers to part with their crops, and also to ths loss by fire of 33,000 tens, together with baling machinery etc,r at Aseivt, supplies of Hay for the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, including Constantinople and the Blaok Sea Ports, will have to be drawn from elsewhere,   Further, Egypt, although self-supporting in Grain for 7 months of the year (November to May inclusive fcve hitherto imported from India their requirements for the other 5 months. India, howevers owing to drought, is unable to undertake additional export either of Hay or Grain.As regards the Hay for Constantinople and the Black Sea Ports,the requirements for which amount to 4,000 tons per month, arrangements have been made for this quantity of straw to be supplied from Algiers, and other North African Ports.As regards the Hay requirements for Egypt, the only alternative is to supply the hay required from England, and, to a smaller extent, from Northern Prance, supply from which latter locality will enable surplus stocks to be cleared off.As regards Grain both for Egypt and Black Sea ports, the only possible source of supply is England, and, to a smaller extent, North France, where large surplus stocks have accumulated.The Shipping Controller has been asked to allocate the necessaryfreight, but, in view of the fact that the quantity of shipping involved will necessitate the withdrawal of cargo vessels from other important services, states that he is unable to provide the shipping required without a special direction from the War Cabinet.The question is, thereforef submitted to the War Cabinet for decision as to whether cargo vessels canf in the exceptional circumstances prevailing, be allocated for the necessary provision of Hay and Grain for Egypt and the Black Sea; the tonnage involved being approximately 30,000 tons monthly; composed as follows?-(a) 11,000 tons monthly of Hay from the United Kingdom and North Prance for delivery by 1st July and onwards for consumption in Egypt. ft(b) 4,000 tons monthly of Hay from North Africa for p delivery in July and onwards for distribution to Constantinople and the Black Sea portst(c) 9.000 tons monthly of Grain from the United Kingdom . and North Prance for delivery in June and onwards,ffor consumption in Egypt.6,000 tons monthly of Grain from the United Kingdom and North Prance for delivery in June and onwards, for consumption by the Army of the Black Sea.(Sd)   Peel.m May, 1919.
