/ol 5Cn&apos;1&apos;/ATTlS^ary Secret. oilifywu Viceroy, Foreign Department, to Secretary of State for India,2Ub May 1919.(Received 22nd.)Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 17th May, 2053. has obviously crossed several of ours, which gave you much of information for which you ask.It was not without full sense of our responsibility that we advocated the forward move in our Army Department telegram (3623, dated 15th May.2. To take your points paragraph by paragraph : (.1) It is our hope that occupation of Jalalabad would not only allay tribal unrest, but also promote early termination of hostilities by bringing home to Afghanistan consequences of their aggression. In that case there would be no need for any advance on Kabul or Kandahar.Chances of having the tribes on both sides of the frontier against us are infinitely greater if we adopt defensive policy within our borders than if we advance to Jalalabad, where we shall get behind our own tribes, and impress both them and Afghan tribes with our strength. Past experience in our frontier campaigns proved danger of purely defensive operations against Orientals, military impossibility of protecting effectively whole of our long, and in parts roadless frontier by passive attitude, and consequent abandonment of British territory on a large scale (temporary evacuation of portions may be unavoidable in any case) precludes us from contemplating any action other than our offensive limited in the first instance to Jalalabad.(2) Seriousness of and, we may add, publicity of, provocation and menace are such as to render attempting (corrupt group) pacific handling hazardous in the extreme, and this aspect is dealt with fully in latter part of this telegram.(3) We are unaware whether Amir (gist of whose letter has since been telegraphed to you) has made formal declaration of war, though we know that such declaration was posted in Peshawar on 11th May, but torn down before it could be secured. Point, however, is immaterial in view of his open incitement to Jehad, despatch to Ningrahar, Khost and Kandahar of (corrupt group) and troops with instructions to raise tribesmen on both sides of frontier and preach Jehad with a view&apos; to co-operation with Afghan advance, which was timed to synchronise some ten days later with general rising in India. Such action is far beyond category of frontier trouble and can only be regarded as deliberate embarking by Amir on an offensive war with all forces at his command.(4) We can only speak of effect on Moslem India. So far Afghan war has not affected it prejudicially, but distinctly the reverse&apos;. We cannot answer for effect of prolonged hostilities, but it is safe to say nothing could be more calculated to prejudice feeling in India than any policy which in the face of public challenge and inherited dread of Afghan invasion could be interpreted as weakness. Owing to her traditional hostility to and fear of Afghanistan, Persia seems hardly likely to be adversely affected so long as we remain on offensive in Afghanistan and our policy in Persia does not lend itself to anti-British agitation. This seems to be borne out by the feeling-in Meshed reported to you yesterday which will be reinforced by receipt of news of our prompt action to repel Afghan aggression.(5) Oommander-in-Chiefs intimation of cessation of hostilities could not be utilised as suggested. It was designedly insolent in tone unaccompanied by any cessation of action and is now commonly regarded on frontier (we believe correctly) as ruse to gain time. Opportunity has, however, been left open to Amir for negotiations by Political Agent&apos;s message that if he wished for peace he should approach Viceroy through General Officer Commanding the forces. -3. We now proceed to give our appreciation of the problem as it presents itself to us. It would be difficult to exaggerate either degree of Afghan provocation or (had we  not grappled with it resolutely) the
seriousness of Afghan menace. Peculiar gravity of both provocation and menace lay in AmanuhYs attempt to secure unity at home by combining Jehad and Indian agitation against Kowlatt Bill into anti-British conflagration embracing Afghanistan, the frontier, and India.4. In Afghanistan everything was to all appearances quiet up to murder trial at Durbar of 13th April. Thereafter reaction against Amanulla speedily set in. Unexpected acquittal of Musahib and family evoked unrest among the troops who had been responsible for their arrest and Nasrulla condenma-tion evoked unrest among the Mullahs. This synchronised with the arrival of highly-coloured reports of disturbances in India, whioh evidently suggested Jehad with prospect of easy invasion of distracted India as remedy for internal disunion. Preparations were at once put in hand to despatch three Gom-manders with regular troops to three points on Indian frontier. Nadir Khan left for Khost on 23rd, Saleh Muhammad for Dakka on 25th, Abdul Kuddus for Kandahar day or two later. Each Commander was armed with inflammatory firman under Amanulla&apos;s seal inveighing against Rowlatt Bill and our cruelty to India in connection with religion, honour and modesty, and winding up with incitement to Jehad. Meanwhile, Amanulla held special Durbar at Kabul and after speaking of tyranny in India and seizure of Baghdad and holy places, asked audience if they were Jehad and, of course, got expected answer. By 30th April Kabul was covered with inflammatory placards.5. These movements of troops, coupled with preaching of Jehad at Kabul and en route, quickly affected frontier tribes whom Amanulla plied with letters, emissaries, and lavish promises of munitions. As was to he expected, the wdiole frontier became swiftly charged with electricity.6. Of internal conditions of India, and especially of Punjab at this juncture, you. have been fully apprised. Rapidity with which Peshawar responded to Afghan postmasters machinations is some indication of the situation Avith which we should have been confronted if Northern India had become flooded with seditious propaganda which Afghan postmaster and envoys and doubtless other Afghan agents in India had been officially instructed to distribute.7. On 4th May, in spite of our moral certainty of authenticity of Amanulla firman and fast gathering evidence that-Zar Shah in violating British territory was acting under orders of Commander-in-Chief under orders of Amir, we gave Amir at eleventh hour opportunity to repudiate firman and acts of hostility. Nog only has he not seized the opportunity, he has reiterated his challenge by calling upon, us to remove our tyrannical laws and tyrannical treaties under threat of bloodshed.8. For in -the meantime our hands had been forced by the replacement of Zar Shah&apos;s tribal lashkars by Afghan regulars, their occupation of territory indisputably British, and immediately threatening Landi Kotal, and con-sequent signs of frontier tribes coming off the fence. By our display of force and resolute action in ejecting Afghans from British territory and seizing Dakka, we steadied the tribes, have done much to rally India, and may possibly even have sown seeds in Aghanistan of a reaction against Amanulla and his policy. Had we shown weakness or irresolution, there can be no doubt that whole frontier would by now be in a blaze, Afghanistan would have been as one man against us, and Northern India doubtful of our capacity to defend her.9. Similar considerations compel us to advocate advance on Jalalabad^. The tribes on both sides of frontier are still closely watching progress of events, and their attitude is steadied and shaken from day to day by what they consider ups and downs of the conflict. Internal unrest in the Punjab-has been quelled by display of military force, but half-heartedness in quelling of threatened Afghan invasion would he interpreted as bankruptcy of our military resources. Until we are in occupation of Jalalabad, Afghans will not realise our overwhelming military superiority our real guarantee against repetition of trouble.
10. At Jalalabad we should be between Kabul and tribes of Tirah and Mohniand country, and intercept their supplies of arms and ammunition. We should threaten Kabul, compelling; Amanulla to concentrate his forces for its defence, and thus relieve our whole frontier of menace of presence of large Afghan forces. Inaction at Dakka would lose us those advantages, while withdrawal to Landi Kotal would be interpreted as inability to advance, and conflagration throughout frontier would be certain.11. We are not without hope that it may be unnecessary for us to proceed beyond Jalalabad. We have been at pains to make it clear by propaganda in Afghanistan that we have no designs on her independence, that we hold Amanulla and his evil advisers, and not Afghans generally, responsible for jeopardising peace on frontier and welfare of Afghanistan. The discontent with Amanulla regime in which present trouble has its origin, may be expected to revive and gather strength with demonstration of AmannbVs failure. There&quot; is no room for failures in Afghanistan, and when AmanuhVs failure is made manifest by our occupation of Jalalabad, there is good chance that Afghans will repudiate him and leave way open for new Amir, with whom we shall have no difficulty in treating. But though we find it difficult to see how we could with any sense of security treat with Amanulla after his outrageous aggression in defiance of his professions of goodwill, and his tampering with the allegiance of our Indian subjects, you may rest assured that we have no desire to continue hostilities one clay longer than is necessary, and will gladly seize earliest opportunity to treat with Amanulla should he remain Afghanistan^ chosen ruler, if we are satisfied that we can do so effectively.12. In short, unless Afghanistan tenders her submission in the mean-time, we are convinced that our best chance of restraining tribes from coming-in against us, of rallying India, and bringing whole operations to an early conclusion lies in earliest possible advance on Jalalabad.
