From Viceroy, 22nd May 1010.(Received 23rd, 10.40 aim.) Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following two telegrams from. Roos-Keppel, 21st May.First. &quot; Following.is a translation of letter dated Tuesday 19th. - Shaban 1337 Hijra, 20th May 1019 from Sardar Abdur Rahman Khan, the Afghan Envoy, to the General Officer Commanding the British troops, received at camp, Dahlia, 10 a.m. 21st instant, to-day. &apos; When I was staying at Simla 1 was deputed by Foreign Secretary to come to God-granted kingdom of Afghanistan and remove misunder-sfcandiug between military officials on both sides. I hurried to Afghanistan, paid my respects to the King of Islam in all haste, and represented matters to His Majesty; I explained to His Majesty certain responsibilities binding on the parties. I am accordingly deputed to start this important business, and am now in Jalalabad. I therefore request you to communicate this to Foreign Secretary by telegram as soon as possible asking him to appoint someone and to fix a place where the parties may meet and discuss matters,&apos;and if it pleases God I shall secure a good name both for you and for myself by the settlement of this great business. If you permit I should like to have a friendly interview with you. I can come to any place you may like to fix for the interview, and until the settlement is arrived at, it is essential that both parties should refrain from committing unfriendly acts. I trust you will send me a receipt for this.&apos; British Agent also writes from Jalalabad that he is on his way to Simla with authentic information that Afghan Government is ready to come to an understanding. Agent asks that bombardment of Jalalabad should he stopped, but I consider pressure should not be relaxed.&quot; Will wire you text of British Agent&apos;s letter as soon as possible.&quot;Second. I feel it my duty to point out to Government of India that Sardar Abdur Rahman&apos;s overtures are, in my opinion, another proof of Afghan bad faith. Had Amir been in repentant mood he would have sent a letter signed by himself. Sardar Abdur Rahman&apos;s conduct in India, as proved by his intriguing in Peshawar and by interception of his correspondence, does not give us much confidence in his sincerity. Afghans have done us all the harm in their power. They are pouring arms, ammunition, money and inflammatory letters and messages into our tribal territory, but are (? clearly) disappointed that the tribes have * not risen. In my opinion, present half-hearted oveiture for peace is a ruse to gain time in hopes that tribes will rise, and rise they will unless we can show some definite success such as the capture of Jalalabad. Amir can always disavow Sardar Abdur Rahman, who brings no credentials. I recommend that Political Agent, Khyber, should meet Abdur Rahman at Dakka or Peshawar and should give him brief reply that as he has no letter from the Amir, we cannot recognise him as accredited envoy. In the meantime, preparations for advance should be pushed forward faster than ever, and Afghans in Ningrahar harried to utmost extent.&quot;Time is of such vital importance and situation is so critical all along the frontier (vide to-day&apos;s telegrams) that we are authorising General Officer Commanding to invite Afghan envoy to meeting, with the following intimation :-&quot; In view of Amir Amanulla(s) wanton unprovoked and deliberate violation of British territory, his incitements of the &quot;tribes to Jehad and his nefarious attempts to tamper with the allegiance of His Majesty the King Emperor&apos;s loyal subjects of India (documentary evidence which is in our possession) hostilities cannot cease until the British Government has secured guarantees that peace of frontier and welfare of Afghanistan will not again be jeopardised by wicked folly of a few evil advisers. Meanwhile best proofs Amir can afford of his sincerity, will be at once to order return of his troops on all front(s) to their peace stations, sending a signed copy of such orders under his own signature to myself. Until the Afghan troops so moved, His Excellency the Viceroy cannot direct Commander-m-Chief in India to order com-manders in the field to cease their operations.&quot;
