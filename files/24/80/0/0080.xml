From Viceroy, 2$)th May 1919. (Received 30th, 10.40 a.m.)757. Secret.&apos; Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 28th May:  First. &quot; I saw full jirga of the Tarakzais, Plaleiiizais, Isa Khel, and Burhan Khel Mohmands at Shabkadr this morning. They were very proud of service they had done in restraining their tribesmen from joining the Afghans and claimed that they had now given definite proof of the efficacy of settlement last year. They have undoubtedly done very well. I restored to them their allowances which were forfeited in 1915. They are much delighted and I think that we can now count upon them. Mohmand militia have also clone very well. Political Agent, Malakand, telegraphs that he has (heard from?) JandoL that the Chitral force drove Afghans down Kunar River as far as Narai and Sao, 10 miles above Asmar, threatening Asmar, which was evacuated by Afghans. Salarzai lashkar collecting to seize Asmar if possible (before ?) Chitral&quot; force. Eldest son of ex-Nawab of Nawagai has written offering his services.   Pie is quite unreliable, but offer is a favourable symptom.&quot; Khyber reports Upper Mohmands threatened to attack Afghans if they retired through their limits, and that it is rumoured there was some fighting between Afghans and Mohmands during the retirement. New telephone line from Peshawar to Dakka via Mnllagori country and Shilman has been erected as far as Shilman Hajihai, and arrangements have been made for tribal guard. From Shilman Hajihai to Dakka it will be protected by Kam Dakka villages. Tribal arrangements have been made lo guard Mullagori road for transport. Aka Khel and other Afridi elders have been visiting the Political Agent, Khyber, to excuse their tribesmen for joining in sniping at Ali Masjid. They put all blame on Yar Muhammad Khan. They have undertaken to recover rifles of Khyber Rifles deserters. Mutilated message from Political Agent, Kurram, dated 27th, state(s) that Nadir Khan has sent urgent letter to Mullah Malunud Akhundzada asking that jirga of the Orakzai should be summoned. Rest of message undecypherable.   There is no other news. Roos-Keppel.&quot;Second, &quot; Copy mutilated message from Political Agent, Kurram, received adds to previous information that troops at Lakatiga border under Kazi Shah Bazurg (to) have moved southwards towards Thai. Report of large increase of regular Afghan troops on Kurram flank corroborated. Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, telegraphing yesterday from Hangu, reports that Afghans had occupied Thai town and looted it. Police evacuated Thana safely. Constabulary ordered to hold post. Khaibat Shah Jamadar removed two lakhs of treasure to post on his own initiative. Deputy Commissioner, Kohat, wires to-day from liangu, reports that Nadir Khan attacked Thai fort several times unsuccessfully last night. Enemy occupied Thai (corrupt group) and police station and mission hospital. Constabulary held out during the night against several attacks. Efforts will be made to relieve them to-day. Evacuation necessitated of Forawari, Manzalli, Karbogha and Gurguri constabulary and police posts. Commandant Southern Waziristan Militia wires from Moghal Kot, dated 27th instant, that about 450 all ranks and followers arrived in the evening at Moghal Kot from Wano and Upper Gomal posts. This represents all who remained loyal. Political Agent, Wano, who withdrew from Sarwekai and Lower Gomal posts to Murtaza has not yet reported numbers brought in, but 61 desertions during evacuation reported.   No more news.&quot;Baluchistan considers that fall of Fort Baldak, considered to be strongest fort in Afghanistan and almost impregnable, should have the greatest effect on Kandahar and all along the Afghan-Baluch frontier.
