FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 21st May, 1919.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

The number of applications for loans for the purchase of machinery received during the past week was 9, and the total value  machinery ordered to date is £18,345.

TILLAGE SECTION.

Notice of the Department&apos;s intention to make a certificate default in accordance with the Regulations under the Third Schedule the Corn Production Act, 1917, was served during the week on an occupier of a large holding situated in County Longford, who, in the opinion of the Department, has failed, without reasonable cause, to ?ltivate the minimum tillage portion of the holding in 1918. The penalty prescribed in the Draft Certificate amounts to  £68. 15. 0.

Up to date Notices of Objection to the making of certificates of Default by the Department have been lodged by twenty-? occupiers on whom Notices of Draft Certificate were served.

PROGRESS OF FARM ? WORK.

Heavy rain at the beginning of the week, followed by great ?, produced a remarkable improvement in growth, and in many places ? are now almost as advanced as in the corresponding week last ?, notwithstanding the lateness of the sowing season. It is expected that the corn crops will suffer less injury than usual from insect attacks, on account of the rapid growth now being made. The condition of the land interfered to some extent with the sowing of mangels and the preparation for turnips during the week, but there is still plenty of time for these operations. In districts where begs are available ?armers are proceeding with the cutting of ?, and owing to the ?ost of other descriptions of fuel the quantity being cut is considerably in excess of the average. Sowings of grass seeds are still being made, the demand for seed mixtures of good quality being maintained.

CATCH CROPS.

Plots of ryo and votches are now yielding heavy cuts and are ?ost uesful in supplementing supplies of hay and glass.
