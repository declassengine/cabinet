-the from Viceroy, 23rd May 1919. (Received 10.45, 24th May 1019.)Clear the line.Secret. Afghanistan. Following two telegrams from Roos-Keppel, 21st May :-First: &quot;British Agent&apos;s letter: &apos;0amp, Jalalabad, 20th May, to the Officer Commanding, Dakka. Sir, You will receive a Persian letter from Bardar Abdur Rahman, Afghan Envoy lately in India, which has been addressed by him to you with my entire agreement. I am here on my way to India, and am staying in Ark (Government House), of Jalalabad, where since this morning I am noticing contiguous bombardment made by your airships at the Ark and city. A few exploded a few yards from my room and had therefore a narrow escape therefrom. Afghan Government, as I am in receipt of authentic and reliable information, is ready to come to an understanding with British Government. Will you kindly take urgent steps to submit this letter together with letter addressed to you in Persian by Sardar Abdur Rahman, the Afghan Envoy, who is also with me here in Jalalabad, to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India, as soon as possible, and stop meanwhile totally bombardment of city and Ark (Government House) till you receive orders from Government of India on the matter, and let us know of result. We both are trying our best to mend situation as soon as possible. Measures have also been (taken by?) us through the local authorities and other means to stop and cool fanatical excitement of the unwelcome word, of Ghaza and prevent any hostile activity by the foolery of Gliazis (waiting for instructions ?) camp or elsewhere on the British border till understanding come to.&apos; Military Intelligence has received repeated reports that Amir is at Jalalabad. It is quite possible that Hafiz Saifullah&apos;s letter was written under compulsion as he does not mention -Amir&apos;s whereabouts.&quot; Second: &quot; Khyber reports that Sardar Abdur Rahman, late Afghan envoy, Col. Nile Sarhad-ad-Darab and Nazir (F.S. Your telegram of yesterday) Hababulla Khan have arrived Dakka camp to receive an answer to Abdur Rahrnan&apos;s letter. General Officer Commanding, Dakka, is keeping them Dakka until further orders. Abdul Aziz, ex-envoy, also at Dakka. Abdur Rahman Khan has brought a letter from British Agent, written from Jagdalak, to the effect he has been recalled to Kabul by Amir. All these men are unaccredited and army commander objects most strongly to these visits which are probably for the purpose of espionage, and he objects to their return to Afghanistan after seeing our arrange-ments. . I entirely agree with him and consider that as they have violated customs of war they should be brought to Peshawar fort, where they can be honourably treated, but not allowed to use information they may have gained. Amir apparently intends to keep British agent as hostage, and there appears to be no reason why we should not do the same.&quot; We have directed that Abdur Rahman should be allowed to say what he has to say and be put across the frontier at once with General Officer Commanding^ reply (as already telegraphed) in writing. He was to be told verbally that British agent&apos;s release was sine qua non of further representations. His two companions are being retained meanwhile.
