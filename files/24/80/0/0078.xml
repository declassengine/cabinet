In August 1918 a claim amounting to  169:7:0 was submitted by one of the dispossessed tenants in respect of (a) loss of hay on land on whioh the dia-:pos8essed stock were grazed, (b) depreciation in value of cattle through being deprived of good grazing land.   The claim was sub-:sequently reduced to  94:5;6, and after negotiation with the claimant&apos;s agents, they decided to accept the offer of the Board of a payment of  52:10/- in full settlement of all his claims.2.   Tractor operations.During the four-weekly period ending loth May, the following operations have been carried out by tractor:-Ploughing 1325 acres, Cultivating 173 acres, Grubbing 140 acres, other operations 163 acres, making the total figures from the beginning of the season 1910-19 as follows:-   Ploughing, 4740 acros, Cultivating 279 acres, Grubbing 203 acres, and other operations 173 acres.During the week intimation has been made to District Agricultural Executive Committees that it has been decided to dispose of most of the tractors, implements, etc. which have been used in connection with the Board&apos;s schemes for the increased production of food.    This will be done as soon as Spring opera-:tions are completed, leaving in certain districts only those tractors and binders which it is estimated may be required for harvesting operations this year.     In districts where the acre-;age of binder work done last season does not justify the retention-:tion of machines for this year&apos;s harvest, all the articles will be disposed of at once.    A suitable plough along with a trolley will be kept for each tractor which is retained so that when the remaining tractors are disposed of after harvest, prospective purchasers will be given an opportunity of securing a complete outfit.It has been arranged to retain for the purpose in-:dicated 50 tractors, 69 binders and 50 ploughs.   &quot;All other machines, implements, etc. will be sold at 12 selected Auction Marts between 3rd and 28th June.     The centres for sale have been chosen with a view to giving farmers an opportunity of purchasing the machines and implements that have been used in their respective districts.3*   Claims under the Corn Production Act, 1917,, Part I.A notice has been issued to the press calling the B     attention / &apos;
attention of farmers to the special need for aocuracy in the filling up of the schedule for the Annual Agricultural Returns, since the entries relating to wheat, barley, oats, mixed grain and rye will in the first instance be taken as evidence of the acreage of these crops in respect of which payment (if any) will be made under Part I of the Corn Production Act.     Further intimation will &quot;be made regarding the actual making of claims.II. COLLECTION OF STATISTICS AND KBTITOS RELATING TO AGRICULTURE. Monthly Returns of Live Stock.A table is appended showing the estimated number of each olass of live stock in Scotland at 4th May, with the usual comparisons.    As compared with the estimated numbers at 4th May 1918, dairy cattle show an increase of 12,000, other cattle a decrease of 21,000, sheep an increase of 143,000, and pigs an increase of 20,000.     It should however be notod that the estimate of the number of sheep is more conjectural than those of the other classes of stock, owing to the fact that the lambing season was in progress at the date of the returns.III. FORESTRY. Forest Nurseries.Reference is made to the Board&apos;s Report of 23rd April last regarding negotiations with the Scottish Sesd and Nursery Trade Association for the sowing of soed by members of that body..    The Board were unable to agree to the financial conditions proposed by the Association, and arrangement 3 -*ere thereafter made with an individual firm of Nurseryman for the sowing of the additional quantities of seed obtained through the Interim Forest Authority.    This will permit of an area of approximately 7 acres of seed beds being laid down this season.During the current season, the Board have forwarded to the various nurseries where facilities have been obtained for additional seed bed areas, &amp; total quantity of 4000 lbs. of coniferous tree seed.      Further consignments of approxim-:ately 450 lbs. of seed are expected to arrive in time for sowing this season.The yield of two year seedlings resulting from the seed sown during the season of 1917 has been approximately 2,200,000 plants, 50,000 of which were sold to a trade firm of nurserymen not only in order to meet the requirements of an immediate planting scheme, but chiefly to provide additional space for seedbeds.     The Board have also disposed of 130,000 plants to be lined out in the nurseries of one of the trade firms on the understanding that the Board retain an option to repurchase the resulting transplants.   The Board have obtained facilities in the, North of Scotland for lining out in a private nursery approximately 750,000 plants.    The remaining plants of the 1917 crop are being lined out at the Craibstone Nursery of the Aberdeen College of Agriculture.IV.   LAND SETTLEMENT.1.   Applications for Small Holdings from Bx-service Men. The /
The total number of applications received from Soldiers and Sailors to 24th May 1919 is 1,219.    Of these 218 have been reported upon by the Board1s Officers.2-   Small Holding colonies Acts 1916-1918.The Board have approved, subject to Secretary for Scotland1s and Treasury sanction, the purchase of the Estate of Thirdpart in the East ffeufc of Hfe, extending to 1,440 aoros.Negotiations are in an advanced stage for the acquirement of properties in Ayrshire, Haddingtonshire and Kincardine; whilst progress has been made with the War Office in regard to obtaining part of the land in their possession at C4retna, Dumfriesshire.
