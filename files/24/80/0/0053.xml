3l   I  (&quot;^^    jfttthis document is the property of his britannic majesty^ g y^ornmeht.hjm nip w uiiMGRANTS IN AID OF THE BLIND.i,.0.13. ftall GMj^frrandum by the President of tUe Local Government Board.1.       I desire the sanction of the Cabinet to the pro-Vieion of an annual Exchequer Grant to be disbursed by the tocal Government Board, in order to oarry out what has been universally regarded as a pledge (and was, I believe, intended to be regarded as a pledge) given in the House of Commons by my predeoeesor in May; 1918, when the President of the local Government Board was1 Mr. Hayes Fisher,   Great dieeatiefaction ie being expressed ai the nonfulfilment of that pledge, and I have no adequate answer to give in defence of the Government in this situation,   the history of the cutter is briefly as follows a.       A Departmental Committee was set up, under pressure from the Labour Party, in May, 1914, when Mr. Herbert Samuel was President of the Local Government Board;   Mr. Hayes Fisher, then Parliamentary Secretary, being Chairman of it.   It reported on July 20th, 1917, by which date Mr. Hayes Fisher was President of the Local Government Board.   Th.it report unanimously urged - (a) the establishment of a Department in he Local Government Board for dealing with the b&amp;ind; b) the provision of a capital sum of half a million for the new oentral authority, and an annual grant of about a quarter of a million, also for the central authority, to disburse in aid of various kinds of work;   and (c) the establishment of an Advisory Committee and other  matters.   Ho mention was made of the necessity of a looal authority, or other matters requiring legislation, as a condition precedent to Exchequer Grants, except in a Reservation by the Treasury representative and Sir Arthur Downee.3.       Mr. Hayes Fisher submitted these proposals to the Cabinet on October 18th, 1917, inoluding the sums named above; and on November 8th the War Cabinet authorised the setting up of the special Department in the Local Government Board (also in Scotland) and the expenditure required &quot;for immediate administrative purposes&quot;, and the establishment of an Advisory Committee for England and False and one&apos; for Scotland, &quot;whose first duty would be to advise the Departments on the prepara-tion of schemes for the consideration of the Fair Cabinet&quot;.4.       Mr. Hayes Fisher accordingly appointed an Advisory Committee in December, 1917, uith Mr. Stephen ^alsh (Parliamentary Secretary of the Local Government Board) as     \ Chairman, and an official of the Local Government Board as Secretary.   This Committee worked hard for 4 months, elaborar ting speoifio aohemee for disbursing the grants, in detail, on the lines of the Departmental Committees recommendations, particularly for training, employment u.d maintenance, i.e. money allowances for persons in their own homes.   The Committee dropped the suggestion of a capital grant as the war was on; but pressed for  135,000 for the yearfe maintenance grant, seating that their schemes vvould in due course require the larger sum of  350,000 which had been indicated fcp the Departmental Committee.5.      The Committee1a proposals were submitted to the Board at the beginning of liay, 1918,, and were adopted or passed by Mr. Hayes Fishar (with the knowledge of the Advisory Committee) on May 5th, 1918, to be elaborated and submitted by the Department to the Treasury.   At the same
time, in on important Statement in Parliament on the Estimates of the Local Government Board on &amp;ay 3nd, 1918, Mr. Hayes Fisher (then President) mode certain strong statements on the subject;   detailing oome of the things needing to be done for the blind,;   he sail, amongst other tflings - &quot;now,&apos; for the first tiusj the State is going to do for the blind, what it should have done many years ago;   it is going to make special provision for then; &quot;i   He named various mutters, the establishment of the Advisory Committee and so forth;   and concluded - &quot;.ve want td establish work-shopa for the. blind, to help them to oell their goods at profit in what I admit is a limited market;   and, for those who cannot work, even when  we have trained them, it is necessary to provide an adequate pension.   That is all in . process of being done.&quot;6.     It       inevitable that the Advisory Committee, and their numerous friends outside with f&amp;offi tney have been in constant communication, particularly the Labour Party, should read in this Statement of the President an official pronouncement that their proposals, which they had just then submitted to Mr, Hayes Fisher, were being adopted by the Government with a view to being brought into speedy operation.7,    Subsequently, the reoommendations of the Advisory Committee, after negotiations with the Bootoh Departments, who eventually adopted the same lines, were submitted for Treasury sanction on December and, 1918, by v&amp;ioh time Sir Auckland Geddes .vae President of the Local Government Board.   The Treasury replied on January 7th, 1919, refusing . any grant on the . round that &quot;they would not feel justified  . &quot;in etmin-. on a policy of assistance (for the blind) &quot;involving both immediate and prospective expenditure of &quot;very larye amountd, without a prior settlement of the &quot;principles in accordance with which the respective spheres . &quot;of responsibility of local authorities and a central &quot;authority in deal in;; with the Government should be clearly  : &quot;laid do*n,* which settlement they said   &quot;cannot be arrived &quot;at without legislation and they ^duld deprecate most &quot;strongly providing funds rtitnout an Act be in;. first passed &quot;which should deal-exhaustively with the position of the &quot;blind and the methods of treating and ae^ietin^. them.&quot;8.    By this date Dr. Addison had become President of the Local Goieminent Board;   and, learning of these faots, directed a second submission of the proposals to the Treasury on February 3rd which they a. lin refused on February 13th.9.    The Advisory Committee (of which Sir Arthur Pearson, the blind Director of Bt.Duns-cans, is the leader) on bein? apprised of this refusal on Iwarch 6th were extremely amry and talked cf resi^nias and raising the whole issue in public outside, but they decided first to approach Dr. Addison by Deputation which took plaoe on March 19th.   Dr. Mdiscn assured them that he would look carefully into the matter including the possibilities of legislation.10.    But the more closely the question of legislation was investigated the greater the difficulties appeared.
The Advisory Committee were however, eo angry at the continual absence of any favourable decision that in order to deter them from passing a resolution of resignaiibn whioh they intended to publish broadcast, they were asked to investigate some fresh possibilities of some alternative forms of sraat aid, for various kinds of services to the blind, w,hich, in tne absence of legislation requiring o* empowering local authorities to act in the matter, might permit of Exchequer aid being disbursed by the Board through and to voluntary agencies for the Blind on more restricted lines which (it v-ae. hoped) mi^ht more readily obtain the concurrence of the Treasury than tneir previous proposals waioh had been rejected.11.    The result of their furtner efiorts *ere sub-mitted informally to the Treasury on May 14th, but the Board were told on the 17th that ftr. Baldwin and the Chanoellor of the Exchequer remained of the opinion that no Government 3*ant oould properly be provided for the blind in anticipation of legislation.13.     I should like to say frankly that I concur strongly in the view of the Treasury that, properly -ipeukinr-, money should not be disbursed to or through voluntary bodies, in such a ca*e a* thi* of the blind (particularly in re .pect of ca*h allowance,, for per*on** in their own home:-), except under the direot supervision or control of suitable local authorities, which themselves contribute from the rate.* arid thus have a direct interest in economy and -iOund administration;   there i*, a special advantage rained by *uch an arxon-vemvut when it is a question of withholding or siting particular *u.n* of money to particular indi.iduals who*e ca*e* may at any moment be raided     grievances in Parliament.13.    But I have now been sufficiently carefully into the question of *uoh legislation to -,uti^fy myself that, in the present ssa-te of Parliamentary tou*iaes,t, and in vies of the specific promise of the Government to deal a* soon a* po*?lbls with the question of Public &amp;4*i*t&amp;ne.e as a whole, it ia quite i.upo**ible to introduce, with any hope of pae.winv; it thin Seiaion, any Local Authorities1 Bill that would suffice for producing even the bare minimum of a*.ii stance to the Blind.   I will not burden the memorandum with a recital of the difficultiei in the way of tbU legislation, whioh are, in my view, insuperable at the present ti...e;   they are *st oui in Appendix A.hereto.14.    On the other nand, there i*, a* I think ha* been bhown above, co widespread a oonviction that the Government iu absolutely pledged to giving substantial pecuniary assistance to thf - blind, that it *eem^ to me quite impossible any lc-n^er to defer feome specific flinancial provision to be disbursed in the oominc; months.15.    The faat that the Advisory Committee ha* been fitting nov; for nearly eighteen months (with constant protest at the delay in seeing any result from their efforts);   that Looal Advisory committees have, as planned, boen established in the seven regions to uhioh the oountry is divided for these purposes;,   that the**e bodies are daily waiting to be provided with the expected means for assisting
the blind in their respective areas;   that every corner of Great Britain has b*en atirred up by the assiduous and suooeaeful investigations of the Advisory Committeea, rniulting in a oompleto register of practioally every blind pur*on in the oountry (about 30,000 in all) and a list of Approved Institutions? (now published) that deal with blind persons;   all this makes it certain that, unless-; a favourable announoement can be made in the next m-k or two, there will be universal public outcry, accusation, a. to broken pledge-,, and the labour Party will oertainly move a hostile r**dluti-n in Parliament and v.ill obtain v/ide*paead support.    The Parliamentary Secretary of this Bo^rd ha a, indeed, been .trongly yrs* ed in the lave few day 3 by *om of the Leadera, and ha* only been able ,.ith difficulty to porjuade them to refrain from thi-$ pour.y by she     surance that the matter la at thi* moment reoeiving the earnest con.consideration of the Government.16.    In the circumstances I would eu-k for sanction to a *um of (*ay)  135,000 for England and  ale a and Scotland together, for the next 13 month * from now, to be disbursed aa proposed in Appendix B., under very careful r&amp;strictiona to be laid down by the loc^d Government Boards through the instrumentality and under the advioe of the Central Advisory and Local Advisory C6omittae*;   and that each Institution participating mu-t have been approved by the*e Advisory Comtritteev with the acquits ;Cenoe of the appropriate County or County Borough Council.-,, which will indicate the adherence of the Government to the principle of the local authority being involved in the*$ matter?.   The main liae* of the pro-po*ed grant are *et out in Appendix B. hereto.   I think the announoement of any *uoh  rants should be aeoompanied by an explicit *tawment that the vtep iv merely an interiw makeahift, pending the e*tabliih.ment by legislation at the earliest possible moment of suitable powers for suitable loow.1 author!-ties in respect of the blind.   And the conditions to be attached to such grants will.of course be submitted for Treasury sanction, and should be devised with every possible safeguard against undue expansion, and against the creation of vested interests whether in Institutions, or in voluntary bodies, or of i ndi v idual par tic iv: ant a.17.    But that &amp;uoh a .?rant cannot any longer be delayed if the Government are to avoid a very grave and justifiable accusation of breach of faith, I venture to submit can hardly be questioned in vie;, of the faota above set out.Local Government Board, Whitehall, 3.W.I.C.A.26. 5. 19.
;v,  APP21TDIX A.Difficulties of Legislation *The Government have given specific pledges to &apos; undertake the reform of the Poor Law in accordance with the general principles laid down by the Maclean Committee at the earliest practicable date.   In view of these pledges it will be extremely difficult to select one particular class of recipients of Public Assistance and to legislate for the needs of that particular class alone. The analogy of the Mental Deficiency Act is a false one, inasmuch as that Act was passed before any sort of under* takinfgjferaa given &quot;by the Government to undertake a general ref orzSfcf the Poor Law.Most of the difficulties which will have to be dealt with when the general reform of the i^oor Law is undertaken, would arise in connection ,vith legislation in regard to the Blind.   The difficulties of areas and of local authorities are the same.     There will be the same controversy as to the relative position of the County Councils and the minor local authorities, and the same ouestion as to the medical services of the large and the smaller authorities, as to the composition and functions of the Committees of the different local authorities, including the questions of co-option and of the- precise character and duties of the Home Assistance Committee.It may be said that the Blind have a special claim by reason if the distressing nature of their affliction but strong claims -:r*uld certainly be put forward on behalf of other classes of persons suffering from physical defects and infirmities.     The case of tuberculous persons, ex-soldiers and ordinary civilians of both sexes, are eminently a case if this kind in respect of r,hom great pressure already exists for grants in aid of inadequate maintenance.Assuming these difficulties to be overcome, there will still have to be faced the almost certain reluctance of the County Councils and Municipal Authorities to embark upon a new method of public assistance in a piecemeal fashion.Pending a general transfer of public assistance to the County and liunicipa! Councils, probably all that these bodies could or would do *-?ould be to act as agents if the Central Government in passing cn grants to voluntary organisations for the Blind, and it would seem to be of very doubtful advantage ti legislate for this purpose.permissive legislation would be almost entirely  -valueless.   Compulsory legislation would be strongly contested.The Blind constitute a limited and a scattered population.   The voluntary organisations dealing with the Blind have seldom any purely local connection such as would justify the Government in attaching them, to any particular Local Government Area - both the persons assisted and the funds disbursed by them are derived from all parts of the Country.
PROPOSAL K)R GBAHT3 71 without LEGISLATION.Assistance from Bxchoquer Grants could legitimately be given at once tt tho Blind through voluntary agencies.    This assistance would take the form of grants in aid of specific services, with satisfactory safeguards both as to financial control and efficiency.    A precedent is to be found in State Assistance to voluntary scheola.    The services to be thus aided might be as follows:-(a) Vorkshops: -   In vie1-&apos; of the reduoed output resulting from blindness of tho workers, workshops cannot pay adoouato wages and remain self-supporting on a commercial tasis, and recourse has to be had to voluntary contribu-tions to supplement these wages  .   further workshop provision is urgently needed.     It is suggested that per capita grants in aid should be given to workshops to render them more efficient as employment agencies and also ta induce them to extend their provi ;ion for workers, including supervision of blint workers in their -own homes.(b) Homes and Hostels:- It is desirable that Homes and Hostels should be encouraged to extend their accommodation and precautions can be taken to prevent the grants from being used merely to relieve the paor Rate of the expenditure at present borne by it in respect of the inmates of these Homes.(c) Home-Teaching:-   The adult blind are taught in their own names how to read embossed type, are read to, and are supplied with books.   At present the number af teachers is inadequate ta the needs and it is suggested that grants in aid could be so given in respect of each teacher efficiently employed as tc encourage the employment *f more teaohers. This service offers scope far the suitable employment of the better educated blind persona(d) Boak-production: - There is a shortage of books for the Blind in embossed type and the cost af production is very high-.   Book-production for the Blind is praotically a monopoly of one Society and a grant based on the cost per volume might properly be given with a view to stimulating further production.(e) Miscellaneous Services:- There are a number of Societies which do a large amount of valuable work for the BlindsTho Sacietica form the chief source of information as ta tho Blind in any district and are affiliated      one or other af seven regional Associations.   It ib proposed that theae Societies should be assisted by grants based on the number of blind persons registered in each area.There are other services which might well call for assistance e.g. research w^rk in respect of new industries for the blind or^for the prevention of blindness such as experiments with protective goggles in certain industries etcGrants would not be payaale except after expert inspection.
