The distribution by type is shown comparatively in Appendix I. This instruction also affects to some extent the value of Appendix 2 which shews the distribution by Industries of Out-of-Work Donation Policies lodged.   But inasmuch as the Industries in which the part-time is mainly existent are the Textile Industries, the reduction of 15,500 in the Insured Industries may be regarded as a genuine reflection of the improvement in the state of employment.Appendix 3 gives an analysis by Industries and by type of the 69,156 Extended Donation Policies lodged by Civilians.   The Insured Industries have a larger proportion of extended policies as is seen from the follow-in,n comparison of the percentages of Extended Policies to Total Policies lodged * -Men.Boys.Women,Insured Industries; Uninsured Industries:17.6 7.7 10.4     5.114,9 10,1Girls.11.34.6The state of unemployment in the 24 largest towns of the United King-dom is illustrated by Appendix 4.The rate per 10,000 is reckoned on the figures of the sugar-buying population as at November 1917.
