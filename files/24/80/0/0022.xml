Secret Afghanistan. Following reports from Roos-Keppel, 20th May:-

First. "Mulla Said Akbar with Afridi deputation to Jalalabad met Kahi Commandant en route and made demands for money, arms, ammunition and rations. Commandant said Afghans could not trust Afridis, who had betrayed them in last Afghan war, and would only issue arms, money and rations after Afridis had definitely risen, but would issue ammunition now. Afridis replied with counter accusation of betrayal by Afghans in 1897 and 1908. Afridis are going in mass (?es) to Kahi, where ammunition is being distributed in enormous quantities. Gossip is that Afghans are sick of fighting and are giving away all their ammunition in order to induce tribes to fight for them, and Afghans have probably unlimited supplies. Informer reports that Mallas in Bajaur have reconciled warring factions there and are collecting lashkars to attack Mohmand border next Friday. This may be premature, as Lower Mohmands, who are easily frightened, seem quite confident, and Hindu women and children have not left Shabkadr as they invariably do when trouble is brewing. All quiet everywhere except on Kurram border, where Afghans continue to make warlike preparations, but have not moved."



Second.-"Latest Mohmand information is three regiments of Afghans, six guns and large Afghan lashkar from Kunar, under Mir Sahib Jan Badshah at Ghalanai. Also many Bajauris, Mamunds, Salarzais and Ambahar Utman Khels. Haji Turangzai has been left behind to raise the Upper Mohmands who have not yet joined. Local opinion at Shabkadr is that force [two groups undecypherable] troops, and that arrival of guns and aeroplanes may possibly cause them to break up."



 Mahsuds still quiet. Kohat Pass Afridis came in for allowances as usual, and are quiet. Zhob reports presence of four regiments at Wazikhwah, some sixty miles north of Kamaruddin Karz. He points out that occupation of Kamaruddin Karz would present no difficulties, and would have very disturbing effect on Zhob Valley.
