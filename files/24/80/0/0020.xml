 hall &amp;*r..From Viceroy, 22nd May 1919, (Received 23rd May, 10.40 a.rn.);Be;c7et.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 21st May : &quot; The Black Mountain tribes wrote to Amir of Hindustani fanatics that they had heard that Jehad had commenced, and asked what they should do. Amir replied that the tribes had previously given him no help when he required it, and that he now wished to have nothing to do with them; also that he is on friendly relations at present with Government, who have treated him well, and has no intention of rising. Mullah Mali mud Akhuudzada is preaching Jehad among the Orakzai in a half-hearted manner, telling tribesmen that, for the present, they should not rise openly, but should damage railways and telegraph lines in their neighbourhood. Kurrain wires situation unchanged. Whole Zaimusht jirga came in to see him when summoned, which is a good sign. Tochi reports that General Nadir Khan, accompanied by a cavalry regiment, three infantry regiments, and artillery estimated at 16 guns, of which one is heavy and is carried on elephants, arrived Almerai (? Almerache). No further news of any advance towards Wano. Reports from Ldazara, Kohat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan districts are to the effect that all is quiet. Amir&apos;s proclamations have penetrated everywhere and have doubtless affected mullahs, but all four independent reports are unanimous that there is little or no feeling of Jehad now that Bannu are faced with the real thing. Our success on Dakka front and the sueing of Sipah Salar for armistice has very favourably affected public opinion and there is, if not loyalty, at any rate a general hope that we shall crush the Amir and prevent Afghan invasion. Afridi deputation to Jalalabad has returned without getting there, much annoyed by their reception by the Afghans. All have dispersed to their homes in Tirah. There is no gathering in Bazar Valley or Chura and all is very quiet.&quot;
