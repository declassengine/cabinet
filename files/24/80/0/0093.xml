WAR CABINET.POWERS TO ACQUIRE LAND.Note by the L^w Officers of England and Scotland on sir Albert Graj1 sjjbserraticna[Hou3,e*&quot;ofjL5rda P5 H30,f I^i L5&quot; tra&quot; Report ofjlr]. Le&quot;slie Scott&apos;s Corr^iTtee -&apos;&quot;]Cd. 8998J&quot;.(Reference: Hone Affairs Committee 25, Minute 2..&apos;) .The precise functions and powers of the sanctioning authority, although stated generally, are net specifically de-fined in the Report and their relation to parliament and to private &quot;Rill and provisional Order Legislation is by no means clear.   We agree with Sir Albert Gray&apos;s criticism of the Sanctioning authority which is contained in head III of his observations at pp. 9 to 12 of the White paper.As regards the proposal to establish &quot;one general system for the obtaining of compulsory powers for the acquisition of land&quot;, our view is that this is impracticable and that it ,loses sight of the vital distinctions that arise in oases where&quot; land is required for public purposes by a public authority in contrast with those cases in which the expropriation of land is desired for trading or prof it-earning enterprises.   We agree generally with the views Sir Albert Gray expresses on this subject on pp. 5 and 6 of his obeervations.We do not agree with the suggestions of   Sir Albert Gray in part IV ss. 61 and 62 of his observations in regard to the operation and suggested amendment of the Lands Clauses Acts.We agree with the conclusion of the Committee that the Lands clauses Act3 are now out of date and should not be applied where land is acquired for public purposes,   jt is suggested, however, that tho Committee&apos;s recommendations on betterment, injurious affection, and recoupment will, if carried out, reintroduce many of the abuses which arose from the compensation clauses of the Lands Clauses Acts.(Sd.)
