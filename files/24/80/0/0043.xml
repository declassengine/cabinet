Information up to morning of 23rd May points to the following distribution of Afghan troops : A. Detachment in Chitral direction and in Mohmand country about 13 miles north-west of Shabkadr.B. Main Afghan force estimated at three cavalry regiments, 14 battalions, and . about 50 guns in the Jalalabad-Dakka-Kahi area ; reinforcements are reported to beon their way from Kabul.   Expansion of forces reported from Kabul but increase is  &amp; not yet known, and we believe that there are five regiments of cavalry, two battalions and 60 guns of the old Army still there.C. On the Peiwar and at Karlachi forces entrenched of about half regiment of cavalry, five battalions and 24 guns.D. About Matun If cavalry regiments, seven battalions and 30 guns.E. At Urgun half regiment of cavalry, four or five battalions and some guns with a small detachment on the Tochi-Khost border.E. Reinforcements on the route to Kandahar were reported in Makur area half way between Ghazni and Kelat-i-Ghilzai, but these may have [corrupt group] to Wazikhwa, where a report speaks of the arrival of four battalions.Tribesmen generally are still hold(ing) aloof, though in some cases tribal lashkars are said to be with the Afghan forces.2. Our proposed plan is an offensive towards Jalalabad in order to (a) divide the tribes and cut them off from Afghan support and influence ;(b) strike at any Afghan concentration within reach ;(c) compel recall of Afghan forces from our tribal borders elsewhere in order tocover Kabul.In the Kohat-Kuram sector, we propose to maintain an active defence, while in the Tochi and Derajat areas we are prepared as a last resort to evacuate temporarily portions of the country now held by Militia garrisons between administrative and political borders. In Quetta we intend an active defence for the present of our Cham an rail-head while holding as much of the Zhob as circumstances permit.3. To carry out this we are concentrating three divisions, two cavalry brigades, plus area troops in Peshawar-Dakka area, one division, two cavalry brigades and area troops in Baluchistan. Kohat has been reinforced by one brigade and one mountain battery, Bannu by one battalion. In reserve we have one cavalry brigade, three infantry brigades, ^one brigade of artillery, and internal security troops, including two mobile brigades.
