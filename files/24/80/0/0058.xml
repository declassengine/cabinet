IffiDTOTOM m APBUTTO.Commander N.1?. Diggle, h.N., is appointed Naval Attache to Italy to date June 7th, and will also he accredited to such States on the Adriatic Seaboard as are constituted by the decisions of the Peace Conference.There has been sone show of insubordination in &quot;Europa&quot;gmongst demobilisable and time expired men.   Commodore Fitamaurice as been ordered to proceed to lucres- at once.The following arrangements have been made with regard to sending out reliefs to the Mediterranean&quot;Benbow&quot; with new crews for &quot;Queen Victoria&quot;, &quot;Empress&quot;, &quot;Ispiegle&quot;, 10 Danube M.L*s, and 700 ratings sails for Malta May 31st and will pay off for refit on arrival.&quot;Canada&quot; witn about 1,100 reliefs leaves Portsmouth on 14th June and proceeds as directed by C-in-C, Mediterranean, eventually returning with reliered ratings.&quot;Ajax&quot; with new crew for ^Blenheim&quot; and as many reliefs as possible sails for Malta about June 17th.  This ship will probably return to England with men relieved &quot;by &quot;Benbow&quot; after whicn she will make another trip to Malta where she will pay off and refit..The Greek Minister has notified *the Foreign Office that the Italian troops have manifested no intention or evacuating Corfu, and desires our Government to join the French Government in advising the Italians to withdraw simultaneously with the French.Detachments from British, French, Italian and Greek men-of-war landed at Smyrna on 14th May and occupied the Forts without incident.  Greek troops subsequently arrived and disembarked and the Forts were handed over to them.   There are now 15.000 Greek troops in Smyrna and its vicinity.   The town is reported quiet and the Greeks are making serious attempts to re-establish administration through the Vali,Intelligence dated the 28th Anril shows that the relief of the British Forces at Varna by Italians is practically com-plete.  All the British troops are now concentrated at Varna waiting the arrival of the transports.Captain k.A. Fremantle, D.S.D., it.N., left&quot;on May 23rd to take up duties as Naval Liaison Officer attached to the Staff of General Denikin.The s.s. &quot;Grotava&quot; has arrived at Constantinople with Russian refugees and has proceeded to Novorossisk, tho undesirables having been landed at Chanak, Dardanelles, and interned.C-iu-C has reported against the project of sending &quot;Aphis&quot; and &quot;Ladybird&quot; up the Don as, owing to the difficulties of navi-gation, and the changing &quot;battle front, there would be a grave chance of losing the ships as well as the crews.   Their with-drawal could only be guaranteed so long as the Volunteer Army continue to hold the Kertch peninsula.Admiral TroubridiTQ has accordingly been told that he may keep the &quot;Aphis&quot; and &quot;Ladybird&quot;.  He*has been compelled to withdraw the Serbian monitors as the crews,not receiving any pay, were becoming most dissatisfied.     He is going to man the snips with recruits whom he hopes to find more amenable to discipline.The .......tho 19th May on the River Vaga,a strong Russian patrol broke through the enemy&apos;s outposts on the Mala Berosnik - Ignatovskaya* &apos; road, killed 20 of the enemy and captured 2 officers,o9 other ratings and 2 machine guns.  H.M.S. &quot;Cicala&quot; materially assisted the operations.
British Motor Launches are not proving very satisfactory as their crews are most discontented bjit as above stated new crews for these boats leave England this week.,. ISELAJLThe Bolsheviks are reported to have occupied Alexandrovsk on the East side of the Caspian&apos;.  A British squadron proceeding to attack this place on the 15th May, encountered an enemy convoy consisting of a Destroyer and 3 steamers towing barges.   The enemy escaped in the mist abandoning the barges, containing coal and wood, which were sunk and their crews captured.   It has been confirmed that the forces at Astrakhan are very short of fuel.The Bolshevik flotilla is at Astrakhan and consists of about 10 small T.B.D&apos;s, a few armed merchant vessels and two submarines. They have been at sea but always retire as soon as our forces are sighted.  It is difficult for submarines to operate in the Caspian owing to shallow water.The Caspian Flotilla ha3 been definitely offered to the Italians, and if they decide against taking it, it is proposed to hand it over to General Denikin, an,d the C-in-C. has been instructed to assist Denikin in organising crews for the ships.mm MM,, ARMISTICE GQMt!TSSIflLSubmarines tThe large submarine pressure dock left Germany on the !22nd May for delivery at Harwich &apos; and advice was received on the 24th instant that she was proceeding in tow of tugs under escort of the Cruiser &apos;^Regensburg&quot;, at a speed of 3  knots.On the 22nd instant the Germans reported that the mine-fields numbers 14 and 65 of the German North Sea mine charts had been remoged and that sweeping operations on the barrages North of Norderney and in the great shipping channel. Borkum Reef -Terschelling had commenced.  Work in the Langelands Belt is con-tinuing.   They also report that there are no minefields in the mouth of the Elbe.A considerable number of drifting mines having been reported between Buoy No. 4 and Heligoland, Admiral Goette has been direoted to keep this channel clear, as these mines may interfere with vessels carrying food supplies.fisrmaa. Mercaufcile.. Marina.Four additional German Ships have been handed over during the week, and the numbers that have now arrived are :-For British .... 136  out of 251 French ....   31 93U.S*A.   .... ...11.,, ,61,,1Z8L 410.;7ith reference to the German Ships in Spain no reply has yet been received from Admiral Goette to the repeated requests of the First Sea Lord for information.   The present situation appears to be that 6 ships of over 2,500 tons, without cargoes, have been handed over to the French but that ships over 2,500 tons with cargoes are being placed under the care of the Spanish Authorities who refuse to surrender them without further instructions from the Germans,   i/ith regard to ships under 2,500 tons, these are reported to remain entirely under German control and the Spanish Authorities will not recognise any right of the French to obtain possession of them.     The claim of the Germans to exempt anyvessels .....
vessels over l,6u0 tons has never been recognised by the Naval Armistice Commission, but it seems clear that the parley with regard to higher tonnage and cargoes which has been permitted by the Commission at Rotterdam has been taken advantage of by the Germans.The German Delegates at Rotterdam now state that the Spanish Military Authorities have taken charge of all ships in Spain and the Canary Islands and removed the crews, and the Germans claim that this action prevents their doing anything further in with regard to the dlivery of the vessels.   If this statement is f-correct &quot;it would appear possible that the Spanish Government has taken this steo in collusion with the German Government in order to enable the latter to evade the terms of the Armistice, and it is suggested that pressure should be at once brought to bear on the Spanish Government to hand over the ships to the French who are sending the necessary crews and tugs.Ttolfiss Ttilfigraphy.The Germans have been informed that permission to re-open the tf/T Station at Cleves for navigation purposes is suspended and cannot be granted until a list of call signs, wave lengths, etc* has been received and approved.   This list was called for on the 24th March, but has neuer been forwarded.Blocfca.de.The Germans have been informed that trade between Germany and Esthonia cannot be allowed.   There is no change in the situation regarding the blockade.The attention of French Government Departments is being increasingly devoted to the necessity for the development of French ports, water ways, roads and railways to fit that country for the economic struggle following the conclusion of peace.   It is realised that the development of French ports and com-munications assisted by her geographical situation will place France in a position to become an entrepot.for trado between America and Central Europe.    Particular attention, therefore, is being paid to be necessity for the development of the deep water ports at Brest, La Fallice, and Cherbourg, and the communications &quot;between these ports and the existing canal system of Central and Eastern France.Admiralty,   So7.1o 27th Say, 1919.
