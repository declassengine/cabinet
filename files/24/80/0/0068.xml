There is some restlessness in Lancashire, and the Police Union is working very hard to obtain a promise of support from the Triple Alliance if it calls a Polioe strike in order to foroe the Government to give offioial recognition to the Union.    The seoret ballot is reported to be a partial ballot, leaving out men whe are known to be stanch. It is thought that if within the next forty-eight hours the Government were to announce an inorease of pay and a determination to dismiss every striker without hope of reinstatement, a large number of the Foroe would stand firm.    Even in the Union itself there are many men who are strongly against the policy of striking.The disclosures in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; are still causing unrest.The agitation about the minimum for Inoome Tax has spread to Lancashire. *The oonoession of six million barrels of beer is not considered suffioient.The/
The disorderly procession to the House of Commons on Mai 26th was not planned beforehand. The men acted on impulse. 1 Underlying their obvious grievances is the feeling that the! sympathetic Interest in the soldier on the part of the publi] has evaporated. !On the whole, though there has been a deoided increase I revolutionary propaganda, probably owing to the fine weathexj situation is not disquieting. There is no increase in the! war. and in some plaoes it is certainly decreasing. Ho doul the association of men of the working olass with Offioers, il Nurses, and V.A.D&apos;s. during the War has done a great deal toj break down the old class barriers. Street oorner orators a: aotive, but they do not appear to,have been making very manyi 0 onverts.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is the most spiteful of the Labour Pi the other &quot;Rebel&quot; papers have so small a circulation that thl influenoe is negligible. I
THB POLICE). &quot; &quot; &apos; vvr&apos;* &apos; &quot; &apos;   &quot;r &apos;The Polioe are taking a seoret balloxi in favour4, or against the strike of Polioe all over the country, and if they obtain a two-thirds vote they intend to call the men out.    This was deoided at a seorot meeting held in the Central Hall on the evening of the 26th, and it was there announbed&apos; that the Triple Alliance had promised to oome out in sympathy if soltora were used in piaoe of the Polioe.    As far as oan be judged at present, the ballot is not being fairly conducted, for a small body who are known to be loyal has not received any ballot papers. Probably the Union is sending papers only to Divisions where it is oertain of a majority.If the ballot is in favour of a strike, it is intended to send oode telegrams to every Foroe where there are Union members, and a mass meeting is to be held on Sunday next in Hyde Park... Meanwhile, Hayes, the aeoretary to the Union, has made the mistake of publishing a letter in the &quot;Daily Herald-&apos;,, apologising.to Labour for the Police having done their duty on the evening of the. 26th, in stopping a prcoession to, the. House, of Commons.,, contrary to the Standing Orders.    In other words Klie has admitted that if the Union is recognised, the public, who pay the Police, will not be able ,to count upon, them for, protection..THE! &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;.       **Si: &apos;*:U n&apos;the agitation oailea&apos;&apos;&apos;:forth by the unfortunate  -circular published by&quot;tiie; &quot;Daily Her&apos;a^d&apos;^ hai :not died down. The Derbyshire MhOrs hoVe followed the1 example of the Yorkshire miners in &quot;calling upon1 the Government to withdraw the Military Servioe Apt, and are in communication with the Trade Union Congress Parliamentary Committee, with a view to taking direct action as a protest against&quot; what they regard/
(English) i * 2 - ijiregard as breaches of faith on the part of the Government, The Leicestershire miners are expeoted to follow suit.My Liverpool correspondent puts the oiroular first among the questions that are disturbing Labour in his   -distriot, but adds that the workers are disinolined to tak action, and are merely sending resolutions of protest to tl) Labour Party and the Seoretary of State for War.The wHerald&quot; staff are delighted with the increase In olroulation that they have achieved, but they admit that advertisements are slow to oome in, and that it will take some months before it oan be said whether the paper will pay.    They claim also to have achieved the early release of the Derby men.    It will be some time before the irritation o&amp;used by the publication of this oiroular will die down.mmmMm w wwmui m &apos; m$sm*Ths visit of the King and Queen to Sheffield and Birmingham gave an opportunity for gauging the revolution^ feeling in the two towns.    In Sheffield one of my correspondents who mixed with tho orowd said that the work! men generally were rather apathetic and uninterested, but nothing oould have exceeded the warmth of the welcome givef by sight-seers on the line of route and by the hands of both sexes in the works that were visited.As to Birmingham, there were no two opinions.    The same observer noticed a considerable difference between th feeding In the two towns, and said that he was convinced that if anyone had had the temerity to say something disrespectful of the King in Birmingham, he would have ben lynched.    There was a complete stoppage of work, and no jj j . general application has been made for pay.    On the nl$tbefore/
1 ,(English) - 3 -before the Royal visit a crowd of about 3,000 people wore watohing the ereotion.of gaslight decorations in front of a building,    Thoy belonged mostly to the artisan olass, and quite spontaneously they began to sing the National Anthem and to give cheers for the King.My correspondent is muoh impressed with the ahsenoe of aoute revolutionary propaganda in the West Riding, but there is evidence of a ohange.    The Yorkshire Miners Association are holding a series of ma3S meetings to protest against the &quot;secret orders&quot; published by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. The Railwaymen are more prepared to support Mr. Cramp than Mr. J.H. Thomas, who&apos;they think has gone to America to avoid the coming storm.    At present the only speakers the workers listen to are men who attack the Government, and my correspondent thinks that a visit from two or three . Ministers who would congratulate the workers on keeping their heads during the abnormally critical period of reconstruction, would do, good.COVENTRY. &apos;tf&apos;&quot;Coventry has for some time given oause for anxiety. ; v During the, demand for labour, men orowded into Coventry fromall parts, of the country, and particularly those who were ,v; not wanted elsewhere.    It is natural, therefore, that there should be a rather large proportion of ill-conditioned men with no corporate feeling or pride in their town to steady them.    Nevertheless, my looal correspondent says that the agitators are complaining that their propaganda is falling on deaf ears, and that the workers are sunk in apathy and prefer constitutional means to revolutionary.    He adds thatthe/
(English) - 4 - irthe meetings held by T. Dingley are not supported by the I respeotable workers, but only by the looal rebels.TO ALIENS&apos; RESTRICTION BILL. . , 1On the 22nd Mfcy the Parliamentary Committee of the Labour Party reoeived a Deputation at the House, of Common! from the Stepney Trades Counoil, whioh demanded a modification of the new Aliens&apos; Restriction Bill, Clause ; Seotions 1 and 2,    It was pointed out that under the proposed Bill no Alien Trade Union in the Bast end oould be affiliated to the Stepney Trades Counoil for fear of a member being arrested for taking part in a political body suoh as the Trades Counoil, and aliens would be excluded from participating in Municipal Eleotions.The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; is anxious to find out how the authorities are carrying out the deportation of Russians.THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PA&amp;TY.The meeting of the Independent Labour Party have been very poorly attended during the week.    Only 25 attended to hear Walton NeWbold at Selly Oak on toy 17th and 200 at Southwark Park. .SOCIALIST LABOUR PARggThe Sooialist Labour Party is urging the British Sooialist Party to join them in a frankly Bolshevist policy on the model of the Moscow Internationale.    Biey describe Henderson and Macdonald as &quot;politioal opportunists&quot;.It is reported that the sales of the &quot;Call the       Iofficial organ of the British Sooialist Party are droppitif-The &quot;Call&quot; is the only Labour weekly paper sold at Id.,.

ftMALQMMED SOCIETY OF -A correspondent reports that a Secret Conference of Shop Stewards was held at the Euston Theatre on Sunday, May 25th, at 7 p,m., and that the future taotios are to be of a Revolutionary character.. Sam Bradley was in the chair. . Tom Mann and Ksaley made violent speeches.RATIONAL ^DERATION ,0? DISCHARGED ft IMMOBILISED SAILORS mO SOLDIERS . ,.   .A demonstration of the London Branohes was held in Hyde Park, May 26th.    &quot;Work and not doles&quot; was the dominating motto of the speeches,    Mr, Wardlefs reply to a deputation that had waited upon him was not considered satisfactory, so after the mass meeting the demonstrators formed a prooession with the intention of laying their grievances before the King.    Having been . headed off by the Polioe they proceeded to the House of Commons, and in Parliament Square/struggle with the Polioe took place, lasting for about an hour.The Nottingham. Bran oh are very much opposed to costly monuments being erected to commemorate those fallen in the War, and think the money oould be more usefully employed for the benefit of disabled men, and widows and orphans of those who have fallen.In Coventry the Federation is more concerned in the housing and unemployment problems, and reoeive&amp; much.sympathy from the general public.frOKDQN WORiCERS &apos; COMMITTEE. &apos; &apos;This oommittee metson the 18th, 21st and 25th May to arrange for a &quot;Hands off Watson&quot; conference, and to demand the release of Ramsay and all political prisoners./

The Conference is to be a Bank and Pile movement to foroe the Trades Unions to aot, and oft Sunday June 15th there is to be a demonstration in Hyde Park, followed by a one day strike the first week, a two days&apos; strike the seoond week and so on, until the Government give way.Tom Mann ha3 promised to take the chair.    The Committee hopes to have the support of the Sooialist Labour Party and the Communist League.WORKERS SOCIALIST FEDERATION^A Demonstration to protest against the Peace Terms was held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, May 25th.    Victor BEACHAM - mentioned in last week&apos;s report - was in the Chair. ;The prinoipal speakers were Tom MAMf, Walter PONDER,, Guy ALD3BD and Sylvia P4NKHUR8T.Tom  Mann made a violent speech describing Parliament ft : as the Exeoutive of the Master Class. v .Ponder said, &quot;We want an international Sooialist Revolution,    It. is up to you to get it.   It is the&apos;bounden duty of every soldier who is ordered to Russia to refuse to go&quot;,Sylvia Pankhurst said, &quot;We went to see a general 1strike, and in addition to the strike, seize the seat of Government.   Set up your Soviets&quot;.On a call.for cheers for a social revolution, Sein Fein and Red Flags were waved and a roar of cheering went up. ;LONDON UlTIVERajTY SOCIALIST. SOCIETY.A Society with about 60&quot;members has just been started Iat/
(English) m 7 -at the above University by Eden PAUL.    This sooiety appears to favour direot industrial action.    The meeting place is Delft Restaurant, Sandland Street, Bedford Row.THE COMMUNIST LEAGUE.. This League has just issued a manifesto on the familiar lines.    It olaims to have five branohes all in London and five more in oontemplation, and it is proposed to open a Communist Club in the City Road,    Its policy is to follow the Soviet system, to proclaim a Proletarian Dictatorship, to effeot the transformation of Capitalism to Communism, and then to build up a representative system through the looal Soviets,    The general secretariat of the League is at 16a, Heddon Street, Regent Street, but though many of-the extremists have joined it, the membership at present seems to be small.BOW AMD BROMLjBY SpCjLaLIST FEDERATION.A meeting was held at Saxon Hall on May 22nd. 400 present.  LANSBURY in the chair and the speakers Robert - . WILLIAMS and SMILLIE.Lansbury said that he wanted a revolution, but without blood-shed.    Williams referred to various strikes that had collapsed through want of unity.    He oould not understand why it was that when the workers had organised so well industrially, two out of three voted for their masters when a general eleotion came along.   The reoent election was a oase in point.    The workers Could get whatever they wished if they would only present a united front.Smillie got a great ovation and talked mostly of what he had done on the Coal Commission.    The Capitalists he said wanted to oontrol the air as well as the land and ifthey/
they oould bottle up the simsnine they would charge the workers for using it.    It was impossible to get an indemnity from G-JR-uny-if we insisted on preventing the import of raw, m;its.r:Lal.    What right had we to interfere in the internal affairs.of Russia?.   2To matter what the definition of Bolshevism is, there was only one true meaning and that.was Socialism.     If the women of Bow had 1 opportunity of tcoding German children, he was sure they would.do it willingly.There was the usual collection.MR. ROBERT CELLIAM3, .&apos;On his ro+omi from AustcivUm WILLIAMS states -that the Sooialist movement in GeriD-xiy has gained ground and the next party in power will be muoh more ad van oed than the present one.    The Spar^aoist and Communist movement has suffered very much, but is far from being knocksd  out. He says everybody in Germany now seems in favour of an alliance with Russia.    One reason why the Socialists of til rftght want an alliance is because they think it will stop the advanced propaganda whioh is controlled from Moscow.Writing to Professor MAHtfOUEY, at Amsterdam he regret! that Robert Smillie is too busy to go to Holland,   (it is j reported that he is going to live permanently in London), i but Williams hopes to oome over himself in3ide two months in connection with the above.    He goes on to say that the; attempt to impose arbitrary peace t^rms on Germany will ha! the same effect on our Militarists and Imperialists as the Brest-Litovsk and Buoharest terms had on the Hohenzollerns Hindenburgs, ludendorff&apos;s and Von Capelles.    The govern!^ t* olasses of this oountry, with their inherent capacity fox double-dealing etc.   are bound to break on the rook of tWworld/

MI am really anxious to talk these matters over with you as I see with more and more clearness that World-Shaking and epooh-&apos; making developments are awaiting .usM.Mr, Maodonald, Longuet and Huysmans are said to be going to Italy at an early date in oonneotlcn with the Internationale.Maodonald is a supporter of the Berne Internationale, and is very much oppji&amp;ed to the Red Internationale.MISS MARY MAC ARTHUR.Miss Mary MaoArthur (wife of the late W.C. Anderson, M.P.) is leoturing in the united States en the progress and aspirations of British Labour.   An exohange of &quot;Labour Professors&quot; between the two countries is now being seriously discussed.THE COMMUNISMThis new revolutionary paper, fine organ of the Communist League, has made its appearance (Vol. 1, No. 1, prioe 2d. is dated May, 1919) and is edited by MOTLER, the doaf mute, who used to run &quot;Satire&quot;.    It will probably have the Borne ephemeral life,     A correspondent Informs me the copy has to go before all branohes for approval and this will hamper it very muoh.    After two months strenuous effort only  16 was oolleoted to start it.    It is printed by the  National Labour PreBS and published from 5, i.jueen&apos;s Ro:.i.d, Peokham, S.E.THE REPUBLICAN.The organ of the English -Republicans started two yearsago/

-farmers and small shopkeepers.While some members of the Sinn F$in Executive are urging a polioy of violence, de Valera and others of the more moderate views, are acting as a brake.    The outrages are apparently not carried out under the orders from the Central Offioe, but are local enterprises.B.H.T,
