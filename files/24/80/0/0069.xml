In Norway, Holland and Switzerland no immediate outbreak is probable. In Bohemia, where it was thought that the example of Hungary might be infeotious, Hungarian Communism has had the opposite effeot, and though   Bela Kun&apos;s Government appears for the moment to be more seoure, it has oertalnly lost suoh popularity as it ever had.The position in North Italy is less satisfactory and the oountry is now suffering under an epidemic of strikes.In Spain the publio is pre-oooupied with the eleotion and there have been eleotoral riots.In Portugal the extremists are not gaining influenoe.In Franoe, though there is a great deal of grumbling on aooount of the high prioes, it is not estimated that revolutionary parties have muoh inoreased in number.In Canada, the United States, and the Argentine there is certainly a growth of Soviet doctrines, and in the United States the Negro question is assuming a new and disturbing aspect.It is now dear that the Amir of Afghanistan has been making overtures to the Soviet Government in Russia and that Bolshevik f propaganda is being supplied to him for circulation.    There is also strong reason for believing that the Young Turk Party is behind the Moslem unrest and that German officers have been at Kabul.Though Egypt is quiet and the Nationalist Delegation has had little success in Paris, it is dear that we must be prepared for trouble with Egyptian and Indian Nationalists in this oountry, unless there is legislation provided for expulsion of natives of British dependencies who make themselves undesirable.
Disoussion of the Peaoe Terms has occupied all minds. There is disappointment that Germany has not been made to pay the Frenoh the entire oost of the war.    As it is, the oommon opinion demands the oontinued presence of armies of oooupation as a guarantee of payment, and there is muoh, . criticism of the announcement that -American troops will be withdrawn from Europe by August 1st., The general opinion is that Germany will sign, and, except in the extreme Socialist circles, the feeling is strong that the Allies ought not to give way on any point.The oost of living in Paris has gone down, but there has been no corresponding fall in I^rons, Havre or Calais. The financial outlook is causing muoh anxiety, for people are beginning to see that the Peace conditions will be no alleviation.   They are now talking of the evil that is being done by restriction, of trade.     There are a good many trade strikes, but most of them are partial, and though there is unrest in and about Paris, no trouble is -expected.* The morale of the French troops is reported to be satisfactory.    The Congress of Railwaymen ended on the 17th after a three dayB&apos; sitting.    Resolutions were passed in favour of the nationalisation of railways, the adhesion of the Railway Union to the General Confederation of Labour, and a solid front against oo-operation with capitalists.    There were also the usual resolutions of &quot;Hands off Russia&quot;.   It was further deoided to withdraw the sum of 70,000 francs invested by the Union in French National Defence  ends&apos;, as a protest against the polloy of the Government.It is estimated that the number of extremists in Paris is not greatly in exoess of that which existed beforethe/
Labour conditions show distinct improvement.    Serious efforts are being made to deal with unemployment and a large number of people have been refused allowances.    Communes &quot;also have been compelled to bear 25^ of the cost of the allowances.    There are complaints, of oourse, about the slowness of demobilisation, but it is expeoted that as soon as Peaoe is signed this will prooeed more rapidly.    There is a recrudescence of complaint on the part of Flemish soldiers of an unfair share of promotion being given to French-speaking men.    The British Y.M.C.A. in Bruges is doing good work among Belgian soldiers, and is described as a very efficient form of propaganda.As regards the Peace terms, if it were not for the demand for an outlet in German 3ast Africa, the oountry would be satisfied.    The farming classes of. Western Flanders are speoially pleased with the Clause requiring the replacement of live stock by Germany.    The International Socialists, who are agitating about the severity of the terms, must not be taken to represent a large body of opinion.      A split in the party .led by Camille liuYSMAHS appears to be imminent.SWITZHRL^D. - -&quot;&apos; -   &apos;    :In Switzerland, the Communists have had a set-back and have consoled themselves by&quot;saying that time is their best ^ ally.    They appear to be olosely in touch with the Communists in Germany.    Public opinion is against them.&apos;   -  * - $he/(Foreign) - 2 - &quot;;the war, but they are more vocal in consequence of so many revolutionary Delegations, all intriguing for their own ends, being congregated in the oapital at the same time.
(Foreign) - 3 -The Americans report that Genevese soldiers have formed an association called &quot;Lea Oitoyens Soldats&quot; to wage war on Bolshevism and Anarchy, and have obtained permission from the Federal Military Authorities to form themselves into a group.Tne latest news from Helsingfors is to the effeot that Platten has been sent back to Russia.GERMANY.It is stated from an American source that the German &apos;; Army comprises nearly a million men.    The polioy of forming an alliance with Russia has an open adherent in Baron Rosen, formerly a Russian Ambassador in Washington and Tokio, who recently left Berlin for Copenhagen.    He says that an understanding between Germany and Russia is the only means of putting an end to the struggles between Soviet Russia &quot;and the Border States, and he intends to approaoh all the official representatives of the Russian Border States in Soandinavia.    Rosen oarried a diplomatic passport from the German Government.    &apos; his policy is openly advocated by Georg Bernhard in the Vossisohe Zeitung.&quot;Herr Heiner, Prussian Minister of the Interior, has stated that the Military occupation of Leipzig was only just in time to avert a Soviet Revolution like that in Munich.    He points to the looting of Stettin as an example of what might occur everywhere if the Government troops were disbanded.    In his opinion, if the Government were to accept the Peace Terms in their present form, they would have to face a rising in Eastern Germany.From a trustworthy souroe, it is reported that the Bolshevik Congress at Essen on the 15th Kay was attended by 189 delegates, of whom 8 belonged to Allied and 16 to neutral nations.    Ill voted for and 70 against the signing of/
of the Peace Terms.    Those who voted for signature were for the most part Independents from Berlin and members of the. , . Basse Group.&apos; - :$he-representatives of the neutral and Allied.  . nations voted against signature.The strike movement in&apos;the occupied territory has died down.      The (ierman Government is calling for proofs of Bolshevik propaganda in Germany, according to a telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the German Legation in Copenhagen.Count Rantzau appears to be flirting with the Zionists, wttiile he regards the German Colonies as definitely lo3t, he is said to favour the creation of a Jewish Delegation to the Peace Conference, in the hope of introducing his own agents into Syria and Palestine as Zionist officials * -      ;A very haig letter has been received by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs from &quot;Several Russian Bolshevists&quot; It  protests against the delay of the Peace Conference and the severity of the Peace Terms which, it declares, are.net in accordance with President V/llson!s Fourteen.Points. .. It urges that russia needs a strong solvent Germany just as England needs a fleet, and that Germany requires in return a strong solvent Russia.    The letter contains a threat that if a Peace is conoluded which is not in accordance with President Wilson^ Fourteen Points, Bolshevism will be oarried to France and later to England.The writers say&quot;Revolution and unrest are on the ebb in Russia and we are endeavouring to restore quiet in Germany as we realise that Russia- and Germany, together with Neutral Countries, oan only be helped by rest and orderliness, to return to peaoeful pursuits&quot;.-The appeal to the &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;, the statement that the letter has been written in German, whioh would befound/
(Foreign) - 5 -found easier to understand than.Russian, the suggestion of a polioy far removed from chat of the Soviet Government, t*nd the threat of reprisals leave little doubt about the real authorship.In Vienna and the provinoes the majority appears to be strongly in favour of adhesion to Germany.   In a speech before his departure for Paris, Dr. SEM&amp;R said that he was goingto France to save whatever was possible of the adhesion policy,and that if he failed it would be only a temporary failure.The Provincial Election in Upper Austria has given the control of the local Diet to the Bourgeois Parties.In Grass there has been some agitation at meetings and in newspapers for separation from the Central Government.    This is apparently being engineered by capitalists, who oppose measures such as socialisation, abolition of bank accounts, and expropriation of palaoes, which are supported by the Central Government.HUNGARY.Information regarding the Communist Government in Hungary will be given in a special report this week.    The little Oligarchy at Budapest is probably stronger than it was a month ago in its power to hold on, and weaker in respect of the violent dislike it has exoited in all classes.    This dislike has been the most effective anti-Bolshevik propaganda in Bohemia.   At the same time, no one seems to have the spirit to organise a counter-revolution, nor the courage to oarry it out, but if a Roumanian or any other force were to invade Hungary, it, is believed that the greater part of the Red Army &apos;  would go over to the invaders.The oountry is undergoing an epidemic of strikes.   One isno/
(Foreign) - 6 -no sooner settled than another breaks out.    The cost of ,   living is constantly rising. ITALY.In offiolal circles it is believed that if Flume is not granted to Italy, the present Government must fall, and that the extreme 3ooialist3 vrill take that opportunit for fomenting disorders.     But many people think that the spectre of Bolshevism is deliberately being.raised in ord to support the demands for Fiume.Though there is no definite evidence on the point, there seems to be ground for believing that highly placed Italians are lending thoinselvos as media of communication . between the Egyptian nationalists in Egypt and those in Switzerland.GREECE.A Bolshevik agent;named SKOLftAY has been prrested in athens.    lie Was carrying two forged Russian passporua an60,000 roubles, and he admitted having received 800,000roubles for propaganda work while in Russia.    He had beerrecent3.y in Roumania and was in touch with Russiansoldiers interned in Greece.ROuateNIA..-;   The problem in Roumania is not so muoh &apos;how to get food as the question of transport.    Prioes have fallen, but not so much aS was anticipated, owing&apos;to the shortage of locomotives.    The worn-out engines are derelict for lack of material for repair. ^ I- The \liied^relief cane into &quot;the; country just when it . was wanted, and the menace of famine is now-over, even?/ the food supplies from the Allies were now to be cutoff. Seventy per cent Of thepre-v/ar area is estimated now tobe/
(Foreign) - 7be under cultivation, but it is thought that some of the harvest will be lost for lack of men to garner it.Industries are at a standstill for want of raw materials and equipment, though the oil industry is now at work and will be inoreased as soon as belting and wire ropes are forthcoming.The Elections are still being postponed, probably in order that members of the new territories may be included in the next Parliament.    The Tr^nsylvanians want complete Home Rule with representatives in the Central Parliament to deal only with questions of defence and foreign affairs. Bessarabia would like Home Rule also, but the existence of Bolshevism on the left bank of the  Dniester makes this impossible at present.The looal administration in Slovakia appears to. ibe working smoothly.    The Slovak peasant is, at heart,very conservative and prone to be satisfied with existing conditions, under whioh he makes a good profit by sellinghis ocrn and milk at high prioes.RUSSIA......   .Events have been moving fast during the week.  The movement of the E3thonian troops with the Russian corps at their head has advanced under the cover of the British Fleet, while the British troops on the Northern Front have been showing great activity,ivQLTGHAiC1 s advance is developing slowly but consistently.    There are rumours that his Government is about to make overtures for the cession of Constantinople to Russia.    He has imposed obligatory service on the civil population of both sexes between eighteen and fifty-five/
(Foreign) - 8 -five; this brings in the intellectuals and teohnioal exper The recognition of&apos; his&apos;Government by the dlies, subject to guarantees against&apos; reaction,&quot;will doubtless accelerate his advance.In the South/General Deiiircin&apos;s volunteer army is -: Marching on Ts&amp;ritsin&quot; ori-the Volga.     It has already taken 10,000 prisoners, 26 guns and 192 machine guns.     If this town is taken the rear of the Bolshevik Army, opposed to t!i Don CossaokS, will be threatened.VThe evacuation of iviCsebw is reported to be developing -  rapidly. - -\     ,!(. .There are disquieting report3 of German intrigue amonj the refugee Prussians of the&apos; better classes, particularly ii the South.    Many of the^e former landed proprietors have lost faith in the Allies&apos;and look to the Germ-^s to put thf back in their old positions.    &quot;There is an intrigue for forming a &quot;Slavonic League&quot;^; embracing the, Poles, the Czechs and the Serbians, in olose allianoe with Germany, and it is intended to put pressure upon iCQLTCAAK to join ... the League as soon as he has suppressed the Soviet Governs. ;.     However this may be-, the fact that the Germans are making i great effort to combine with Russia oan no longer be doubted.The oost of living in soviet Russia is still.rising, and the ravages of famine and eoldemios. are spreading.    Ii Petrograd a bottle of new milk oosts 15 roubles , and owing to the shortness; of fudder, the live weight of a cow is said to hav&apos;3 decreased to forty stone.    There are many  1 oases of cho3ora in Potrcgrad.     it Moscow, horseflesh oosts 5C roubles a pound and oah only be obtained on a ration card.    There are 3.000 cases of typhus a week.According to the &quot;Red Gazette&quot;, the production of wor*and/
(For$Urn) ... 9 ...f:;n&apos;d-f actor lea iii  oviet Russia has decreased 90^. ,The Americans report that the Germans have offered the Bolsheviks Army Instructors and railway engineers, in exchange for the abandonment of Bolshevik propaganda in Germany and recognition of the independence of the Baltic Provinces.. Kartashov, the minister of Education under KERENSaY, now in Helsingfors, states that the Russians generally are opposed to the Finnish Expedition, but he thinks that the hungry masses of Petrogrud may welcome intervention from any source.    He said that the Russian Church w^s not to be treated as a political factor, for it had always learnt to serve under the temporal power and would fit&apos;in with any Government; even internally it had been very little affected by the Revolution. Siberia.In a memorandum dated the 28th February, Monsieur XLESM, local representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in VTadivcstock, points out that the :&apos;imerican representatives in Vladivostok: are surrounded by revolu-. tionary Socialists, and are therefore &quot;inolined to favour the extreme parties in opposition to the Government.    He says that the moral support&quot;thus given by the Americans will have serion.3 consequences -t&apos; and that; the duty of maintaining order in the country is rendered difficult by interference in internal affairs..American bympathy with the extremists is also commented on by the,Japanese Press, where it is stated that Bolshevism is spreading among the American troops, and that they object to the&apos;suppression of Bolshevik propaganda.poiMd.The position in Poland i3 still very confused.General/
1*   iGeneral Pli^DDOKi, till lately a socialist of peasant origin bids fair to become a sort of rational hero.    His men are Said to be ready to follow him anywhere, and he id inclined to ignore the authority of the oiyil Government.    He is m immune, however, from the weaknesses of his ola3s and is mi taking on the airs of a bourgeois of noble birth.    lie appij to be acting quite independently of, and to some extent in opposition to General H&amp;IIiER,Meanwhile, German agents are reported to be busy inoit General HaLUfc^s troops to commit atrocities against the Ji in order to enlist the Jewish Community in all the Allied : countries against the Entente. German agents are also-reported to be spreading Bolshevik Propaganda, and for tail there appears to be no remedy but the introduction of cap! and raw material to furnish employment.Generally speaking, it may be said that the Poles hat the Russians first and the Germans next.A report has been received that the Finns are turning the population against them on the Olonetz Front.    80jfe of the Red Cadets were reported to be anti-Bolshevik, and had I it not been for the wholesale butoheryjj, they would have gajover to the &quot;Whites&quot;.:   How they are fighting desperately.&apos;1JOKls/AY.It is not considered probable that any form of revolution will be attempted this year,    The- labourers af too well paid at the moment to be carried away by the extremists, whose policy is quietly to undermine the Army and to spread disoontent among the working class. jThe Labour Party is, on the whole, very much incline1 to the &quot;left&quot;.
Sweden. :&apos;&apos;The actual position of Bolshevism in Sweden, may be described as follows - &quot;    - In some of the Northern &quot;Swedish provinces, the &quot;&apos; majority of workmen are Bolshevik:.   In Westnorrland the &apos;&quot;&apos; Bolsheviks are in an absolute majority.    In Stockholm they are also very aotive and have some influential. : leaders,   .    ,. ........ ..,/;. ^v*^fjBoth in Westnorrland and Stockholm they are in olose touch with Moscow., probably through. Finland.Denmark; . 1 &apos; &apos;;&quot;&apos;A new Communist Association for sending propaganda to England has been started by Hussion Bolsheviks in Copenhagen, under the pretence cf being a charitable institution.Confixmation has been obtained that the publication of &quot;Volk und Land&quot; is subsidised by the German Colonial Office to oarry on anti-English propaganda, with Trisch, a Zionist., as $ditor.., .....Russian soldiers., who ore being repatriated, declare their intention of not going to...the Front, on their return to Russia, nctvlthstanding the measures&quot;whioh the Bolsheviks may U3e against them.HOLLAND. HV;.. n.T,;;.,;-   &apos;Acoordingto a 3enior Officer of the Dutch Police, conditions are better now than they have been for a long time past,   The. Bolshevists are short.of funds, and are quarrelling among. th pas elves. .. The working o las sea are beginning to settle down in the gradually improving conditions of-the oountry.     ......&apos;The Burgerwaoht is increasing! in popularity, and many professional men are joining it.    They are permitted to/
(Foreign) - 12 ^to retain their rifles and ammunition in their own homes, in order to be ready for any emergenoy.An American report rather confirms this, view, and adds that unless the Communists completely dominate Germany no serious developments noed be expeoted in Holland.SPAIN,     &apos;v^y. hn..i jvA-t^ *:;csv :rU where is little change in the political situation. Aooording to an intercepted letter to Tom MANN written by the Syndicalist ROMERO, Syndicalist propaganda is making progress in the agricultural districts, but for the moment the mind of every Spaniard is pre-occupied with the ooming General Election.    There have- been electoral riots in the Toledo and Burgos districts.The shortage of wheat, which is partly attributed to the three months1 strike in the Argentine, is becoming serious.PORTUGAL.Labour unrest appears to have diminished, and Labour matters are being adjusted by mutual discussion and agreement.    A Decree establishing the eight hour day is being eagerly disoussed by all parties.EGYPT.There is still industrial trouble on the Suez Canal, but on the whole the situation is quiet.Moderate opinion approves of the new Ministry formed on May 21st under Mohammed Said Pasha, and there is disappointment among the extremists that it was found possible to form so strong a Ministry.At a Conference of Turks and Egyptian Nationalists held at Territet on the 11th May, arrangements for a newNationalist/
Nationalist outbreak in Egypt were disoussed.    A rising was to take place as soon as the Egyptian Mission., now in Paris, had definitely failed.    It was hoped that the rising would spread all over Northern, Africa,    We have information th.vb arrangements are on foot to purchase arms, and to ship them in a Dhow, with a small motor-boat on board for running them ashore.    The necessary steps will be taken.The Egyptian Delegation is disappointed With their progress in Paris, and are feaid now to have given up hope of causing friction between England and Ffanoe on the subject of the British Protectorate.    Moreover, the French Surete officials have written a rather strong letter to the Minister of the Interior, urging that the time has come to require the Delegation to take leave.There is definite evidence that there have been communications between members, of the Delegation and the so-called Egyptian Association in London.    The time has ccme for providing some legal means of removing seditious natives of British Dependencies from the United Kingdom when their activities become dangerous.    Otherwise, it is quite likely that there may be attempts at assassination and outrage.There is reported to be a revulsion of feeling among the small cultivators against the lawyer and student olass for promoting an agitation which has resulted only in causing grave material damage and the restriction of railway facilities for individuals.TURKEY.In moderate Mussulman oiroles internationalisation under American control is favoured.     In Palestine, theMussulman/
Mussulman is waiting to see what aotion his co-religionists I in Egypt and India are going to take, but armed resistance   j is not contemplated.     The publication   of the names of the Turkish Delegates to the Peace Conference has depressed patriotio Turks.   The Delegates are considered weak-kneed and ignorant of foreign politics, while the Cabinet ia composed ol men who carry little weight.There appears to be strong opposition to Frenoh influenoe in Syria, and people are talking about armed resistance to Prenoh occupation in the hope of receiving British support.    Those who favour a British Protectorate do so in the hope of profiting by British rule, with the intention of breaking away as soon as the Syrians are ready to oombine with the Mahommedans of India and Egypt.v/hile Bolshevism is opposed to li-hommedari traditions, many Moslems are in sympathy with the movement in the hope that it may weaken the Western Powers, and so give the Turk the opportunity for regaining his independence.The spread of the &quot;Ottoman Rights&quot; Movement, which is entirely politioal and has nothing to do with religion, is by no means confined to Moslems, for some of the leaders in the Movement.are Christians and Greeks.    Formerly it was organise: and financed by Germany, but now the money is being found by private individuals.    It is working in olose touch with the Egyptian nationalists:   both Societies are using the Pan-Islam ory.As an Example of how the Bolshevik creed appeals to a certain olass of mind, the following extract from a report by I a British Colonel stationed at Constantinople may be of interest &apos;        k%q one brought into olose contact with the Bolshevik leaders and listening to them and understanding them oan avoid sympathy fortheir/
their principles and for the faith, earnestness, temperance and enthusiasm with whioh they hold these principles. They preach the simple human doctrine of Christ and the early disoiples.    They wish to create a new heaven and a new earth in which there is no greed, envy, hatred, malioe or any unoharitableness,&quot;INDIA.   ,A report, as yet unconfirmed, states that the Afghan movement is being directed by Enver Pasha, who is aooompanied by Turkish and German officers..    The &quot;Young Turk Party&quot; has doubtless been behind the movement, and there is definite evidence in the oomplioity of the Persian Consul in Vladikavkaz (Caucasus) in the Bolshevik propaganda in India; he is supplying the necessary Persian passports.There are indications of a new revolutionary method in India.    Two Hindus are believed to have sailed early this month for India from the United States, with the intention of spreading the religion of &quot;Retaliation&quot; (another name for Bolshevism) among the natives.Khiva is a hotbed of Pan-Islami0 propaganda.    The Amir of Bokhara is sitting on the fence, but will not take an active part against the British,    The Bolsheviks have armed large numbers of Kirghiz to fight for Islam.    The Turcomans are apathetio and will not take part against the British.&apos; It is thought that the Turkestan Bolsheviks may attack the. Trans-Caspian front, or, failing that, join the Afghans.A man has been arrested in New York distributing propa-ganda among returned wounded soldiers in hospital.    Besides a very misohievous Bolshevik leaflet, there waB a oopy of &quot;Indian Freedom in Amerioan Courts&quot;, and the Gopal Singh leaflet published by Gadr Asram.Amanulla, the Amir, and Mahmud, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Afghanistan, have sent sealed letters to the&quot;President/
&quot;President of the Russian Eepublio&quot;, both dated 7th April. The Amir&apos;s letter declares that on asoending the throne, he announces to the Russian Republic his adherence to the pclnoiple of equality for all men.    Wow that Russia has rais: the standard of Bolshevism, he hastens to declare that she he earned the gratitude of the whole world.    The tone of the letter is subservient, and quite different from his tone in addressing the Indian Government,    .Mahmud hopes that permam friendly relations will be established with the Bolsheviks.Amanulla has also addressed letters to America, France, Japan, Persia and Turkey, explaining that &quot;owing to oertain oauses&quot; Afghanistan had hitherto boen unable to open relatior, with other great Governments, but these letters have not yet been despatched.Apparently a pamphlet is to be printed in Persian and Hindustani on &quot;Bolshevism and the Koran&quot;, for circulation.Mr. HOMIMAN, Editor of the &quot;Bombay Chronicle&quot;, who was deported from India, has arrived in London,   He is staying &apos;-&apos; with his brother in Kensington.SOUTH AFRICA. -: * &apos;   !The south african Nationalist Delegation is staying at the same Hotel as the Egyptian Delegation in Paris, and has recently held several meetings with 0&apos;Kelly, the Irish-Amer,i.oan Delegate. &apos;&apos; :AUSTRALIA.The dook strike in Sydney has beoome serious.    All shipping, except the Oversea Trade, is idle.    Supplies of coal and food ara short, and prioes are rising.    The 3eamen&apos;s claims include a six hours * day, and neither side will negotiate, pending Federal Intervention.    All the elements of riots appear to be fermenting.
(CANADA.The. strike in Winnipeg is collapsing,   The control has been transferred from the Unions to the citizens themselves. A Volunteer Police Organisation has taken over the guarding of the city, and 4,COO picked-volunteers under the command of 0-eneral KITCHEN and officers who have lately returned from the Front, are drilling at the Central Military Barraoks.    The Citizens&apos; Committee has organised, a very efficient service of private motor-cars for the trans-port ati on of volunteers.Volunteer policemen are patrolling the streets side by side with the regular policemen, whose sympathy with the strikers is resented,      -    .The Government is to conduct an investigation into the efforts of the extremists to establish the Soviet, and the &quot;- deportation of any &quot;Redo&quot; or Bolshevists, under the new Emigration Act., will be considered.It is further resolved by the Government that State, t iemployees who fail to return by noon on May 2(3th will be definitely refused any plaoe in the Federal Servioes.AMERICA.Aooord;Lng to&apos;information gathered from an intercepted letter, a general strike appears to be planned in Cleveland, Ohio, for the 4th July, firstly as a demonstration for the release of political prisoners , and secondly to obtain a .six hour day and one dollar per hour&quot;minimum pay.    Another letter gives the 1st July&apos; ;..s the date.It is estimated thit 255&amp; cf the Amorioan Sooialist Party are Jews.    9f0f* cf the Jews in-Ar.erioa are said&quot;to be socialist in spirit as the natural result cf their treatment in Russia and Roumania, from which countries most of them come.    They / are to be found in the ranks of the  Industrial Workers of theWorld/
World and other extremist organisations, and it is a curious faot that many of the notorious &quot;GTOMEN&quot; of Hew York are Jei In the larger Trades Unions, where the Jews have got the control, there is a tendency towards revolution.   Though thi Jewish workers generally are- in sympathy with the BolshevikJ it is thought that they would never attempt any organised rising unless they were sure of the support of th*e American&quot; bom working man.As in England, the Socialists and extreme Radioals are violently opposed to the Peace Treaty.Tho State Department has issued another warning against] the trade corporation controlled by Martons, who is still Vice-President of the Weinberg and Posner Engineering Oompai with a capital of 8(25,000,000.    The Guarantee Trust companies: has denied the allegation that It is finanoing Martens, but? there is little doubt that persons connected with the Compa: i are doing so.Ludwig Christian Alexander Carlovitoh Martens, who is I desoribed as the Representative of the Soviet Government of Russia in the  United States, is now a man of 44.    He was I born in Russia of German parents.    He applied for, but was j refused Russian naturalisation, and he served fqr two years j in the German Army.    He now claims citizenship in the Hew I Republic of Russia, although he has not been in the oountryI for the past thirteen years.    Until lately he spelt his rial &quot;Maertens&quot;.    He is a very competent meohanioal engineer. 1 - During his stay in England, he wa3 believed to be intimate with revolutionaries such as Malatesta and anarchists suohi Peters, Petrof  and Swars, who were oonoerned in the       il Houndsditoh murders.    On the 10th August, 1915, he was    j exempted from internment as a German.    At this time he wsfil living at 42, Swinderley Road, Wembley, and was thereregisters
