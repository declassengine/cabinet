This Documenttv of\ . Hi,s Britannic iyjajesty&apos;s GovernmentSECRET piRBCTQRfi.TH! OF ITOILLIOENCiS -    -Special Report (Home Office)Scotland Houso, S 31st May, 1919TUB COMMUNIST REVOLUTION IN HUNGARYInformation and documents have now been received from Budapest on whioh an estimate can be formed of the real aims of the new Communist Government and its ohanoes of stability. With the exception of the brief and partial experiment in Prance in &quot;1848, it is the first time in history that the modem Communist doctrinaire has been put in a position to try his experiments on a machine in full working order; for when the Bolsheviks assumed control of Russia, the machine was already dislocated.   The experiment, therefore, deserves to be studied with care, -The&apos;Communists believe that Germans were behind the -&apos;Buda Pesth riots - as agents ^rcyooateursThree weeks before the Revolution sham agitators provoked a stsrm at one of the newspaper ,offices,.   They were repulsed by Government troops, but seven of the Police were killed and forty-seven ,persons wounded.. There was immediately a demand.that the Communists, should be. imprisoned/as a.public.danger, and thirty were arrested, including Bela Kun, Alpari, and Bela Vago.   Theae threo men were seised by the Police and beaten with the butt end of rifles,   Vago and Kun were thought to be dead when they were carried to the cells.It was, however, soon established that the outbreak had nothing to do with the Communist Party, and there was arevulsion of feeling in their favour.   They were removed(Circulated by the Home Secretary)to/
to a better prison and later were released.When Count Karolyi resigned, he had&quot;really no other course open to him than to hand the country over to the . Socialists.   He is a vain and rather stupid w&amp;, who was regarded as so pro-Entente that at one time he was suspeoted. of being an Entente agent.   He oame into power on promises that he could not perform, and when he could no longer face the storm of publio oritioism he took the line of least resistance.   The Socialists deolined office unless they had the co-operation of the Bolshevik leaders and theso men, having aooepted off ioe, at once went in foi a Communist Government in its most extreme form.To do them justice, the Communist   leaders made no secret of their aims.   As in Russia, they, poured forth a flood of declarations of policy, propaganda and legislate Their main scheme was simple enough; the State was to tall over the ownership of all public and private property, every oitizen was to receive a fixed wage and to pay a fixed rent and a fixed prioe for every oommodjLty; no one was to be persecuted.   On the other hund, sinoe, it was neoesaary.to have a &quot;Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;, until people had ceased to yoarn after the old order, oi to use the words of Alpari - a member of the Government &quot;until they had oeused to be blinded by the glorious lif of the new free life&quot;, there must&quot;be unquestioning obedienoe to. the Government on the part of every -citizen on pain of deaths.   Thus, as will presently be seen, the workman must do the work prescribed for him rapidly and efficiently without idling or striking; the civil servat1 must be content with his salary and with such promotion might oome his way; the shopkeeper must make a faithfi inventory of his stook and turn it over to the Govern^1the/
tho bourgeois must take what was allowed him out of his &apos;former income and be thankful for being allowed anythingat all. ; -.i .Three or four weeks ago, the new Communist &quot;TenCommandments&quot; were placarded all over Budapest.   They areas&apos; follows !**-:1.    Defend the power of the Proletariat, which has led you out from the land of captivity, from oppression by oounts, bankers, factory owners and generals.2.    Have no foreign ideals and do not make to yourselves idols.   Fight for Bed Hungary always that it may be as strong and perfect as possible,.3.    Honour the Republic of Soviets and follow its commandments.   The Republic of Soviets is working for you and you must ,fight for the Republic4, Do not lose courage. On the day when you lose courage, your former oppressors will regain their strength.* 5.    Do not disturb order.   If you step out ofthe ranks you are a mere drop.of water, your general   ;iy can destroy you with two fingers of his ...        hand.   If you remain with your comrades youare a victorious sea that swallows up the old world and brings on the new one.6,    Maintain discipline,7,    Do not forget that you are surrounded by enemies within would  without.. March with strong feet, grip your weapons with strong hands, and the sword shall fall from the hands of your adversaries and&quot;national &apos; . frontiers be swept away.8.    Do not allow in your ranks anyone whoincites you to riot, for he is speaking the speeoh of the enemy,9.    Do not allow in your ranks any disturber of order or provocateur.10.   Do not take away the rich ruan&apos;s house, his ox, his land&apos; or his Jewels; let. this be the business-of the Council.   Only thus can -  everything be yours and. your brethren&apos;s -tho inheritance of the working men and the agricultural poor. , .The/
W PERSONNEL&quot; OF THE ADMlNISte/JlOH.Attached to this report are photographs of the Communist Offioe Holders, of whom 25 out of 32 are Jews. It will be observed that several Commissaries are assigned to each &quot;Department,   It may. be well here to give a brief account of the&quot; more important of them:-BBIiA Kim.Bela Kun, though so prominent in the newspapers, is perhaps the least important member of the Government. He is described as a clever self-advertiser. In the hope of impressing the workers that in the eyes of the world the issue of the revolution hangs upon his life, he is always to be seen with a personal bodyguard of six armed soldiers an armed guard is made to stand outside his uedroom door day and night, and a maohine-gun motor is posted outside his hotel. The more serious-Ministers smile at this play-aoting, for Kun&apos;s life ia. in. no danger whatever.i i3oae of them apologised for him, saying that he was an illiterate man ,and-deserved great credit for having done as well as he has &quot;with no&apos; equipment but that of a third-rate orator.   They are nervous and uncomfortable when Kun goes to see foreign Mnistero by&apos;himself; he likes &apos; &apos;  it but they dread it, for. he gets into difficulties when he tries to explain the Communist doctrines, EUGEN HAMBURGERThis man is believed to be an Emissary of the Germa General Staff, but is now the principal Commissary for Agriculture.   He is a German from the Virohow Institute,Berlin, and he flr&apos;st oame to Hungary two years ago,Hesettled in a small village in Somogy, where he preached the simple life and doctored people for nothing.   Later,he/
he worked as a doctor on the troop trains, but having-taken, part in a mutiny, he was imprisoned until the Armistioe. Though not a declared Communist, he started a peasant rising a fortnight before the Communist Revolution and helped to seize one of the big estates. - At this time, the other leading Communists were in prison. GEOBG LUKAC3Georg Lukacs was formerly Professor of Philosophy at the Heidelberg University and is also an art critic, now Commissary for Eduoation,   Being the son of a banker, he had a fortune of some three millions, which he spent on the Communist Party or* gave up under the new laws.   He is the author of the ambitious eduoation scheme, under which children are removed from their parents and educated in the confiscated palaces until they are twenty-four; he tried to compel nine or ten,thousand bank clerks, out of employment, to aot as schoolmasters.   He is an amiable dreamer.JOSEF FOGANY.     , . , .  , -     ;Josef Pogany, Commissary for Foreign Affairs, is now openly accused by the Red Army of being a sham Bolshevist in the pay of. the German General Staff.   He was Commissary for War until a few weeks ago four or five thousand soldiers assembled outside the War Ministry for the purpose oflynching him.   They accused him of intending to overthrow the Revolution by bringing back the entire Staff of the Officers of the old regime.   They were pacified with fdifficulty, and Poganywas made Commissary for Foreign Affairs. This was done to show the mob that the lynohing of Commissaries, whenever an adverse z-f^jvvot their conduct was circulated, must be discouraged.   The other Commlasaries admitted, however, that some indidents in Pogany^s oareer did require explaneition,and/
and that they were watching him.JULiua m vBsxThis man was formerly an engineer in an eleotrio light faotory.   He ia in on advanced st&amp;te of consumption.   He has always been full of academic theories about Socialism, and now, as Commissary for ,3ooial Produotion, lie has an unique opportunity for putting them into practice.   His ideas are that qualified engineers are the salt of the earth, the real kings of creation, anr; ta.it the revolution is really to rest upon t.-eir shoulders.   These men now are strutting about tho factories olothed in authority and bursting with self-importance. JOSEPH 3;iXS.. This Hungarian Jew was a member of the Sooialist Party rat seventeen.   He spent three years in Berlin as correspondent to a Hungarian Sooialist newspaper, and about 1904 he was appointed London correspondent to the wVorwaertsM,   He spent ten years in London, and left a little before the outbreak of War.   He has an extraordinary belief in his. own powers.   He was very active at the Sooialist Conferonoe at Berne, and was also in Amsterdam at the time of the Communist *,ooession to power.   On his return to Buda Feath he found that the ICommunists had telegraphed to Holland for him, and he desoribed himself i&amp; being in a quandary because he did not wish to tie himself up in Hungary when there was a chance of his being offerod an important post in the British Cabinet on the outbreak of revolution, whioh he believed to be imminent.   After some consideration, he decided to take officf in order to gain experience, and .fter a weok or so he was good enough to confess his surprise at finding that departmental administration hud had surprises for a man. even of his intellectual calibre.   Saxe hopos before long to oometo/
to London.   Probably, if ho knew that under-no oiroijimfftanoeo&quot;-would this be allowed, he would desert the Communists and try to rehabilitate himself.   He is now the Press Propagandist and Controller of the Telegraph Bureau of the Communist Government.Tiber Szaninelly is one of the Commissaries for War. He is a friend of Lenin and was one of Lenin1a organisers in Russia.Commissary for Agricultures,    He oame from Rubs ia with &apos; Bela Kun. - &apos;   &apos;bugek vargaCommissary for Social Froduotion.   Was a writer on Economics in the Karolyi Government.This man surprised his friends by coming out as a Bolshevik.   He was a former leader of the Sooialist Party and always kept hiuself in the background.Commissary for Foreign Affairs; was formerly a University Professor. ZOLT^ ROMAI and BUQBN LaKDLal3These men.were both lawyers.the executive.There is a &quot;Directorate of Five&quot;, consisting of Bela Kun, Bela Vago, Sigmund Kunfi, Joseph Pogany, and another whose name is not known,v The secretary to the Directorate is, ALPaRI, of whom no photograph has been obtained.   He is the brain behind Kun.   He is a Jew of idealist views, and so extreme in his programme that ho was expelled from the hungarian/
Hungarian Socialist Party before tne War.   He was also deported from Germany on account of his intimacy with Liebkneoht, and he served several terms of imprisonment for his views.   He freely admits what he calls "the ingratitude of the masses towards the Communists who had removed from them all causes for worry." Those ingrates now turned on the Communists, accusing them of having removed all the ? and hope in lifo. This, he explains by saying that ? have lived so long in the dark that they are "clined by the glorious light of a new free life." In their ignorance they were agitating to go back to their "former state of slavery. What the Communists intended to do was to ? capitalism so entirely that there would be no slave-owners to whom they could return. Then they would be happy. His great scheme is housing, of which details are given below.

The following is a general summary:-The ConstitutionSupreme authority is vested in the national congress, whose members are chosen by the councils of Comitats and towns on the basis of one member foreach village elect for their local Council one member for each hundred, (in towns, one member to each five hunared).   The Local &quot;Council is limited to fifty for a village and three hundred for a town. The Central Council sits at Buda Pesth, and is limited to five hundred members.   Each Council seleots an Executive Committee of not exceeding five for a village and twenty for a town.   The eightymembers of the Executive Committee at Buda Pasth are ex officio members of the National&quot; Congress.   The Local Councils have executive powers in looal matters, but are bound to carry out the orders of the superior Counoils, who have also power to vary or annul the resolutions of a subordinate Council, The Franchise. ,\ .Tho right to vote Is limited to the workers of both sexes who are eighteen years old and are actually working.   The following are disqualifiedEmployers/every 50,000 inhabitants.   The working people ofif
Employers of labour.Persons with private incomes,Merchants,Priest3, - Lunatics, :Criminals,Control of Land.There is a rather large number of laws on the taking over of the land by the State and the control and farmingof largo estates.   The effect of these laws is to give a fixed):wage to the poasant farmer, while the State takes all theprofits.   There is also an instructive class of enactmentdealing with tho suppression of disturbances and with personswho assume authority unlawfully or confiscate property in thename of the State.   The following is an examplej-&quot;Tho Revolutionary Councils1 Government gives notioe that anyone acting arbitrarily in affairs belonging to the sphere of the Revolutionary Councils&apos; Government, of tho individual People1s Commissariats cr the authorities subordinate to thorn, will be tried by the Revolutionary Court.Anyone unlawfully making use of an armed force (guard or military) is liable to a special penalty.   The Revolutionary Councils&apos; Government may also enforce a death penalty&quot;,or again&quot;During the l&amp;st few days it has happened repeatedly that armed individuals, wearing military uniform, and also othor persons, have methodically visited dwelling-houses and business premises, have stated that they were functionaries acting on behalf of the Authorities, and have requisitioned dwelling accommodation or business promises, or havo exts&amp;ted provisions jand other articles from the alarmed inhabitants&quot;.For this the penalty is announced to bc:-&quot;Hard labour up to ten years, a fino up to 50,000 kronen, or, in especially grave oases, Ideath&quot;..Restrictions on TravellingTravelling abroad or to other p^rts of Hungary is forbidden indefinitely, unless upon urgent and necessary business.   Travellers are searohed at the stations to Iprevent/ [
prevent them from removing money or food, and a small sum only is allowed to them.All letters for foreign or home postage must be posted in open envelopes.   Foreign representatives, diplomats, and others on oxfioial missions ore to be aocorded every courteBy and their dwellings and flags respected. The Food, Laws. *The food laws are very much what one would expect. All raw material belongs to the State and is allotted by the Government, who also allots food supplies for hotels.   Aloohol is forbidden.   There are detailed laws for the cultivation of tobacco tind sugar beot, whioh is compulsory in certain oases.   The seed must be obtained from the Government and paid for, and all private stores of seed have to be surrendered. Heavy penalties are prescribed for tho sale or giving away of tobacco.   Agricultural maohinery has to be surrendered and ro-allotted by the Government.   As in the case of otaer industries, all profits go to the State, and workers are paid a uniform wage. Transport. ;All means of transport such as oars, aooeesories, and a proportion of horse transport, have been oommandeered. The oars, in particular, are a great dolight to theCommissaries, of whom each is allotted a car and a driver free, as well as free mea^s and lodging ^n the best hotel, and 1,000 kronen a month more than anybody else.   With 3,000 kronen a month, a free motor-oar, and no expenses, it is not surprising that the Commissaries are thoroughly enjoying themselves.   Thoy are, &apos;in faot, the only class in Hungary of whom this oan be said.The/
The Administration of JusticeUnt il th q r^ox&amp;xiiBeAdjQTuj^&apos;V i&amp;&apos; AoMnijrtratdon -of Justice, the Commissary for Jus^tioe^had power to suspend JudgeB and lawyers and to entrust &quot;any persons- whats^ovecr&apos; vdth the provisional direotion of Courts of Law and of the legal profession,   Revolutionary Tribunals ,*ro to be Bet up wherever necessary.   These consist of a Fresidont and two members, together with minor officials appointed&apos;by the Soviet Government; &quot;such appointment shall not be dependant on any kind of qualification&apos;........   There Bha]be no right of appeal against or any other legal means of contesting the verdiot of a, Revolutionary Tribunal&quot;.   Hot only is there no.right of appeal, but even petitions for mercy are made futile, for we read, n\ petition for pardon of a condemned person, made no matter by whom, shall not suspend the execution of the sentence&apos;,&apos; whioh shall bo executed immediately after the announcement of the verdict&quot;,   As to procedure, the accused and his Counsel have the right of the las,t word.   The vordiot is given by secret vote after a secret deliberation, and for death sentence this vote &quot;ust he unanimous.   Accused persons arc be brought before the Tribunal immediately after arrest. There is to be no formal indictment, and whenever possible the whole proceedings are to be Carried through at a sing] sitting.There is a power of &quot;preventive arrest&quot;, which is vested in tho Commissary for Frcscoutions, all. People&apos;s Commissaries, and the Politioal Commissaries with the &quot;Red Guard. .The Labour Courts.Courts for settling Labour disputes must have twoJudges from the working olass, and there is no appeal against their dooision. .Housing/
Something was said above about Alpari&apos;s Housing Scheme.   The laws include many enaoiments on this subject,   ;ill houses belong to the State, and everyone Eusjy pay rent,   Moreover, no-one can have more or less than tho number of rooms allotted according to the number of the fa;.iily.   The proletariat &quot;is plaoed first on the. list for allotment as rV,r as tho Statute is concerned, but in practice.Government officials take good care to house themselves before considering the proletariat.   The principle of allotment is &apos;0ne man, one room&apos;, and for families of over eight, four rooms are allotted.   There are, however, qualifications in respect of rooms used for professional purposes, such as doctors&apos; consulting rooms, etc   Even the former owners have to pay rent.   The only people excused are workmen inhabiting houses which are their own property. These pay Land Tax only.  v^0n rooms we allotted in a house, tae new tenant has the use.of the furniture and joint use of the kitchen.   The Housing Committee . stands no nonsense in collecting rents.   The rent must be paid within three days on pain of fine or imprisonment. Landlords are not allowed to make any enquiries about prospective tenants.   They must put up with what comes.There were apparently some Mtohefl *R tiie working of the Housing Commission, for on /\prll 8th the &quot;Dwelling Gffioe&quot; announced a suspension of applications for three days, and added that &quot;anyone who tried to introduce a new tenant into a dwelling, or requisition it forcibly, will be tried by the Revolutionary Court according to Martial Law&quot;, but with thi3 went an &quot;Appeal to Buda Pesth Homeless Proletarians&quot;, whioh promises to abolish the Dwelling Office of the &quot;mad and mean Bourgeoisie Government&quot;(Karolyfs)/
(Karolyi&apos;s), and appeals to "Comrades" to have patience till the Revolutionary Council can got to work. "Comrades! The dwelling misery and the abuses of requisitions and confiscations of dwellings have of late attained such inconceivable dimonsions that they must be met with the whole intensity of the power of the revolutionary prolotariat". The whole document is written in this oratorical strain, but if one seeks for facts or guidance one is disappointed. Alpari&apos;s great scheme is to cover the hills round Buda Pesth with workmen&apos;s villas and picture pala?. This, he thinks, will make everyone contented. There are to be ninteen to the acre as against thirteen in the English Scheme.



All houses are to be on the same fixed plan :-



?

Sitting room ... 4.85 x 4.30

Kitchen ... 3.10 x 2.53

Larder ... 1.40 x 1.30

2 bedrooms ... 2.54 x 5.24 and 2.22 x 3.25

Verandah ... 2.6 x 2.50



The rent for these houses is to be 600 kronen a year (present rate £7.10s. 0d.). Later on they hope to build houses at 1,000 kronen a year, with an extra bedroom and a bath-room. The rents are calculated at 2 1/2% on the cost of building, which is estimated at 25,000 kronon per house (present rate £312 a year). They hope to build 500 to 600 of these at once, and eventually 20,000. Repairs are to be carried out by the State. "House Commissions", composed of "confidential persons" elected one for every twenty-five dwellings, are to be established. They will buy provisions for their constituents, and certify every citizen who wishes to buy for himself clothing (including house linen), extra furniture, crookery, and eating utensils. The certificate must say that the preletarian has a real of the article he wishes to buy. This buying permit must be producedto the shopkeeper


shopkeeper before he is allowed to sell. It never appears to have occurred to tho legislators that the "confidential person" may be open to monetary persuasion. Education.

Education is free. All schools have been taken over by the State., Workmen&apos;s Universities are to be founded, and young workmen are to receive technical instruction at fixed times during working hours. "Culture is a property of the working classes", and to ensure that it reaohos them most of the theatre tickets will be retained for the active working classes, and sold to them at moderate prices through tho Trades Unions.   School teachers are to be taken over with the schools, and their appointments confirmed, subject to "an examination as to their social views and capacities". Provided that they undertake to "adapt themselves to the fellowship and spirit of tho Republic", and that ? consent to become ?, all shall be employed and well treated. The law for the "Protection of the Proletarian Youth" (no other youth is recognised) provides for an examination, with a view to classing thorn for workshops. Once classified, they are to be quartered according to category in houses connected with the workshop.   An Important part of tho Education Scheme is the Palace Scheme of Georg Lukaos. The State is to oonvert all the palaces, Royal and private, into luxurious schools which aro destined to become very much like reformatories, since every child is to be taken away from its parents and kept in those Palapo sohoolo until he is twenty-four, if he shows aptitude, until 18 if he

is dense. School-children are to have free dentistry; every dentist must give two hours daily to this work on his own premises and
and with his own instruments.    He will be paid 1,000 kronen a month, and ah allowance for material.    If he refuses his diploma will be withdrawn. Labour.The power of the Central Government over the workers is a power that would not be tolerated for a moment In any other oountry.    Under Enaotment 12 miners may not ohange their trade nor leave their places of &quot;work.    They may hot even enlist in the Red Army.    Ho worker is allowed to throw up his job or strike.   &quot;When a difference of opinion ooours between the Workers&apos; Council of the Works and the Commissioner for Production&apos;, the Council must not aot independently, though it may lodge a oomplair with the People&apos;s Commissioner for Social Production, who will thoroughly investigate it and make an immediate deoision,,    This deoision iff binding, and until it is arrived at, every order from the Commissioner cf Produoti is to be observed&quot;.      The Commissioner for Production is appointed by the Central Government to manage the Works. Any breach of this enaotment is apparently to be dealt with by tho Bed Guard,    In other words, the Army is tc be oalled in to settle trudo disputes.Thero is compulsory insuranoe, half paid by the State and half by tho worker, on a soale graduated aooording to pay,    (Sick benefits arc also graduated). ]fobour is oompulsory. and, oonvorsely, thoro is a right to employmont.&apos; All unemployed or physically unfit persons nuot work whore work is available, but are supported by the State.    The rato of wages ie as follows :-Agricultural labourers live rent free and have milk and bacon free.    The mon reoeive 25 to JO kronen a day,and/
and the women 20 to 25;   girls and youths from fifteen to eighteen, 12 to 15 kronen a day, ohildren under fifteen, 8 to 10 kronen a day.    20 per oent extra is given for speoial garden work and 10 per oent extra for harvesting. Wages in towns and factories range from 5 to 18 kronen an hour.    a skilled labourer on piece work can earn from 2,000 to 2,500 a month.    At the ordinary flat rate he earns 1,800 kronen in theory, but ho can always make 2,000.    The pay of- the Rod Army is really pooket money, beoause the men are housed, fed, and olothed by the State.FINANCE.The finanoial adviser to the Government is a bank clerk, who admits quite cheerfully that he knows nothing of finance, but that this does not matter in the least bocause when the World Revolution is an accomplished faot, finanoe will be no moro ncedod abroad than it is at present in Hungary.Tho first act of the New Government was to plape 32 leading banks under the control of this Commissary.     Any person may draw 10% from his current aooount up to a maximum of 2,000 kronon monthly;    the remainder of his inoome goes to the State.    In case of illness, an additional 1,000 kronen a month may bo drawn.    Land holders, provision dealers and certain oontral offioes are allowed to draw more, with the oonsont of their respective Commissarios.   Bank directors are limited to a salary of 3,000 kronen a month, and provided they are not dismissed by the Government, they must continue to perform thoir duties.    On tho other hand, for the wages and salaries of officials, monoy to an unlimited amount may be drawn, and generally speaking, banks arc bound to comply with any domand from a People&apos;s Commissary. ,All private safes in banks have to be opened in the owner&apos;3 presenoe, and if he refuses tho key, the safe will be brokon open and all the contents oonfisoated.    If ho opensit/
ID*w 1 8 &quot;*it, the value of any money in foreign currency or gold is orodited in Hungarian monoy to his -ourrent aooount, out all speoie and foreign notes are handed over to the Central Banking Offioe.    This is probably designed to steady the rato of exchange,mm.All shops employing more than ton people and all wholesale businesses, as well as factories and warehouse! have been taken over by the State, whioh pays the salaries, of the employees,      The business is carried on by the Commissary for Sooial Production, and the employe! eloot a oounoil from among thea:3elves to &quot;establish working discipline, protect the property of the oommunit and control the methods of business&quot;.    All shops employing ton persons or less have to furnish an invento: of their stock, and if the inventory is incorrect, the shop is seized by the State and the former owner sent to factory.   The State allows the small shopkeeper a propor; of the profits, provided that he sells only to persona producing tiokets.   Shops selling only luxury articles are to be closed, and it la illegal to sell luxuries of over a certain value.   such business may have a current oash balanoe of 2,000 florins, and no profits are to be made beyond the small percentage over cost price allowed tc defray aotual expenses.    The penalty on a shopkeeper for concealing goods is death.   The State claims all goK and 3ilver articles and jewellery over the value of 500 kronen,It may&apos; be asked what safeguard there is against ovsij production, which proved the downfall of the municipal workshops, in Paris.   The answer given by the Commissarie is that a boot faotory would only be permitted to males boots up to a stook sufficient to allow two pairs to evspers
person,,    Boots are not to bo graded, all of them must be of the best quality.    When this stock is reached, the factory would be switched off on to making saddles or, if necessary, the workmen dispersed in other factories making leather goods.THB RED ARMY.The men are to be recruited from among organised labour, excluding miners, on the recommendation of the Trade Union. On the 4th April, all men of tho old regular .army, including officers, were called up unless specifically exempted, . Officers, from Company Commanders upwards, tire appointed by tho Military Commissary;   subordinate offioers are elected by the men.    Nearly all the.offloors belong to,the old Army. Tho candidate&apos;s name is published, and within a week anyone is free to lodge information as to his &quot;individuality, past oarecr and political reliability&quot;.    A political repro-sontative is posted to eaoh Unit by tho Military Commissary,The Reserve consists of &quot;Workmen&apos;s Reserve Battalions&quot;, whoso offioers are chosen exclusively from proletarians, under the instruction of offipor-instruotors, who have not th right to command or bear arms, ,In addition to the ordinary Red Army is a body called &quot;The Rod Guard?, whose duty it is to,maintain internal order. It supersedes all polioe forces and its personnel is inter-changeable with that of the Red Army.    According to a proclamation mation by the Government, tho Red Army is an arm of the Revolution of the Proletariat;   founded on the principles of revolutionary disoipline, it is the olass army of the Prolota lat.    In this oonneotion,v it is interesting to note from the published scale of pay that there is a daily allowance of 10 kronen for &quot;seryioo outside the garrison (i.e. the suppression of disturbances and enforcement of laws)&quot;.   One o the duties of the Red Army is &quot;to deal with workmen who strike in/
in defianoc of the orders of the Labour Court; It is in fa a punitive battalion, rather than a blackleg battalion.Clause 7 in the Red duard Law dated 26th March sets up a Secret Service (Investigation Department) as a measure against &quot;politioal intrigues&quot;.Tho Commissaries say that tho invitation to the old offioers to rejoin was given on tho advice of Lenin.    They were assured cn the one hand that if thoy refused, their allowance of 2,000 kronen would be stopped, and if they consented thoy would be treated with &quot;perfect kindness and respeot&quot;.   The men wore enjoined to respect their offioers and, in sOme particulars, the officers haw fared better thJ thoy did under the old regime.   They wea* officers&apos; unifon but without the badges of rank;   they are saluted on parade but not in the streets, because the officers discard the distinguishing armlets of their rank when off duty.    They of course, anti-Bolshevik, but so, it is believed, is the rank and file, now that the men have been disillusioned after learning what Bolshevism really means.   Nevertheless it is not believed that any military rising against the Commissaries is to be looked for.    The Hungarian newspapei have advertised so widely the outrages of the J&amp;issian Bolsheviks against counter-revolutionaries that all classes are thoroughly cowed.    The poor dispossessed nobles sourrj into their houses - or rather tho rooms that remain to thei like frightened rabbits.    The place is full of rumours of the arrest of counter-revolutionaries and no one trusts hie neighbour.   Experience seems to show that the Red .&apos;irmy will dosert to the other side rather than fight an invader.    If the ma3S of the people thought that tho allies had abandons the idea of intervention, they would be in despair, for intervention is their great hope.CONNECTION/
comctich with imaiA.The Commissaries declare that thoy are In direct telegraphic communication with Lenin three or four times a week if not.oftenor;   that Lenin is consulted about every detail, and that it is to Lenin that the Intelligenza owes its safety.    He seems to have been insistent on this point, saying that he himself made the mistake of imprisoning them, until he found out too late that the workers Could not do without them.    This does not accord with the views of men like Saxe, who would like to see them all killed, but Lenin insists that starvation would be the result.    They must be ooaxed into the Government, but in such a way that the people do not,get suspicious.    The name of Lenin carries .   enormous weight;   when a rumour spreads that Lenin&apos;atheories are.to be put. into practice, everyone shivers with . fear.According to a wireless message received this week, Lenin has: declared that Buda Pesth cannot become tho centre of the World Revolution; that must be Mosoow, and all other centres must oboy her.    Russia (that is the Soviet Commissaries) is deeply disappointed /with the Hungarian Revolution, and oonsiders Bola Run greatly to blame.So far from being, contagious, tho Hungarian variety of the Bolshevik virus seems to have cured the early stages of. tho disease in Bohemia.    A week after tho Bolshevik Revolution,, the Ccmnuni3ta in Prague were about to have a trial of strength with the Majority Sooialist3, but the orowd of fugitivos - workmen, peasants and soldiers -escaping from Bela Kun&apos;s Government over the Bohemian frontier, seems to hate oaused a great revulsion of fooling all over Bohemia,The same thing has happened in Vienna.    During the v   week of April 4th to 11th, when packed meetings were held byHungarian/
Hungarian agitators, everyone felt that Bolshovism would sweep the oountry and a revolution was oxpeotod about April 14th,   The Commissaries in Buda Peoth were on tho tiptoe of expectation, but whon tho nows of what really happened in /ionna reached Buda Pesth, they were bitterly disappoints for all that happened was a badly planned oolsheviot riot which was easily put down.iQSBa P ig&apos;TH.-ine best hotel in Buda Pesth is&apos;, of oourse, oooupied the Commissaries, and they live there at the publio expense, At the second best hotel you may have a bedroom and morning tea at 10/6 a week (43 kronen); lunoh in the restaurant oosti from 20 to 30 kronen.   \ cabinet, even for the shortest distance costs 25 kronen.   The rato of exchange is at present 120 kronen for a  1 note;   living is thus much cheaper in Buda Posth than in Prague.The hotel staff tries to show its best side to visitors though the waiters are disappointed men,   They had been promised a division of the profits, but all they oan get is 12$ of the restaurant takings, and this is loos than they were getting before the Revolution.    All over the restauran appear notices making it a penal offence to give or receive a tip, with a penalty of a long term of imprisonment, and each waiter is afraid to aooept a tip lest a oomrade should g inform against him.   The Soviet Administration makoe it impossible for them to steal anything from the hotel, for a the food that goes in haB to be aooounted for.    Only one bath is allowed a woek, owing to the lack of coal.No religious habits are seen in tho streets.    The Priests went into sooular clothes or disappeared, and it is only lately that the churches are re-opening and that Communes are allowed to appoint Priests at their own expertArmy/

They found to their disgust that if you allow working men to choose between a Socialist leader and an educated bourgeois, they elect the latter, and until you eliminate the bourgeois they will always do so.On the question of the franchise.thoy are quite explicit; a universal suffrage would not suit them at all.    &quot;If you allow everyone to vote you will have a sort of Kerensky Government.   You have oiuy to say that you are limiting the vote for a period of six months, and people will be satisfied&quot;. It does not appear to occur to them that it may be diffioult to satisfy people vtao are denied a vote, just at the time when their future destinies^aie being deoided.    The elcotion of the present Government is not a conspicuous example of free institutions.   A list of possible Commissaries was made out, about twice as long as the number of offices to be filled. Only Trade Unionists were allowed to vote, they were not allowed to add any names; all they could do was to eleot from the list given them.   Seeing the present offioe holders, one is&apos; inclined to wonder who the unfortunates were who failed to be eleoted.*t any rate, there is one happy olass in Hungary to-day, though it is a small one; vthe Commissaries are enjoying themselves to the full.    They are exactly like a lot of mischievous schoolboys let loo^e in a shop of a scientific instrument maker, for it is remembered that they have thewhole/
