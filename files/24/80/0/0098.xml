ADJUSTMENT OF JRAVITIES J)iLM3 SR.MEMORANDUM 3Y THE, FOOD CONTROLLER.The War Cabinet On May 29th, authorised me to negotiate with the Brewers on the basis that the gravity of Beer in each scale should be increased by 3 degrees, the average gravity to remain the same,I regret that I have found it impracticable to conclude any satisfactory arrangement on these lines. If the gravity in each class of Beer is to be increased by 3 degrees, the average gravity of the whole output must be increased to the same extenta Otherwise a Brewer who is now brewing at or slightly below the permitted average gravity would have to brew a much larger proportion of Beer of a lower category than is the case at present. Of this Beer there Is already a greater supply than the public require, and Brewers are naturally disinclined to lower the standard of the Beer which they are accustomed to supplyBI recommend therefore, that the Cabinet should permit the average gravity of Beor to be raised by 3 degrees, that is to say, to 1043 degrees in Great Britain, and to 1050 degrees in Ireland,   I am advised that if this is done, there will be no difficulty in making arrangements with the Trade which should prove satisfactory to Parliament,The matter is one of urgency, as at present neither the Exchequer nor the Public are deriving any pecuniary benefit from the increased outpute   I should, therefore, be glad to receive the Cabinet&apos;s decision within the next few days;InGEO. H. ROBERTS.INISTRY OF FOOD. 3rd, June 1919.
