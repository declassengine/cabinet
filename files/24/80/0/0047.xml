(THIS DOCUMENT lb THE PROPERTY OF1&apos;&apos; HIS BRITA&apos;NFIG ooJESTY^. G-0vj^NIIFMT)SECRET.G. T. 7346.145WAR CABINET,WOf-EN&apos;s EMANCIFATIOM BILL,COPY OP A LETTER PROH THE PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL &quot;HKTTHE r^Iim^F Till1&apos; OP EDUCATION: OFFICE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL, WHITEHALL, S.W.26th I:&apos;ay, 1919,Dear l&quot;.r. Fisher,Women&apos;s Emancipation Bill, I enclose three copies of a draft Bill on the lines which we were discussing on Saturday.   I think the terms of this Bill are sufficiently wide to cover clause 1 of the Bill which has already v-een introduced and also the Bills which have been introduced by Lord Buckmaster and Lord Beauchamp removing the disqualification of women for entering the legal professions and for admission to the magistracy.   On the other hand the new Bill would, and in my opinion the Bill already introduced would not, remove any legal disqualification which may exist at present for the admission of women to orders in Church of England.The question of the legal disqualification of women is, apart from any question of policy, very difficult and technical, and how far a mere removal of legal disqualification would effect-ively throw dopen to qromen careers from which they are at present debarred, not so much by reason of actual disqualification as by the fact that they are not in practice admitted, is a matter on which the opinions of lawyers might well differ, and I hope that before the form of the Bill is decided upon an opportunity will occur for obtaining the advice of one of the Law Officers,I understand that thev Report Stage of the kronen1 s Emancipation Bill is the First Order on July 4th, arid, no doubt considerable pressure will he exercised to secure the passage of that Bill in some form or other father than the withdrawal of the Bill on a pledge fror the Cover-merit to introduce r new bill.
Should it he decided to adopt the former   course I think cl. 1. of the V:0 &quot;en*s $mancipation nill might perhaps be piloted to stand sub loot to one or1 two swell verbal alterations, end to the addition of a proviso in the terns of tbe new draft Dill.   In this case Lord Bucknosterfs and Lord Beauchairp1 s 1 dlls-; ould have to proce h1 independently *Clause 2 of the ! operas Emancipation Bill oould of course have to be omitted, and clause 3 would have to be supplanted by a hovr clause in the form of clause 2 of the now draft Hill, and I think it vould be well to take the opinion beforehand of the Speaker or of his advisers a-hethewhether, if the &apos;do^en1s Lmanci-pation Bill were mutilated to trie extent outlined above, it would not have to be regarded as a new Bill and consequently liable to re-introduction.As respects the peeresses, Schuster has nob yet seen the clause in the new draft Bill.   It deals with a technical matter which he understands much better than I do, but the clause as it stands is sufficient to show the idea which emanated from our conversation on Saturday.Yours sincerely, (Signed) Hugh Godley.Rt. Hon. K.A.L.Fisher, H.P.,Board of Education, WHITEHALL,. S.W.I.
