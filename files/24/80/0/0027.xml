Military Secret.914From Viceroy, Foreign Department, to Secretary of State for India,23rd May L919.Secret. Afghanistan. Letter from Amir (see our telegram of the 17th May) has&quot; been received here and carefully translated. Letter runs as follows.   Compliments and superfluous adjectives omitted.&quot; Your Excellency&apos;s letter elated 5th May has been received.&quot; With regard to what you have written about Zar Shah that he should be arrested, I regret to say at such a time when all people-Hindus and Moslems of India have combined against tyrannical law which Government have considered it advisable to enforce, and Muhammadan and Hindu subjects of Afghanistan, especially people of frontier, owing to sympathy and racial nearness have displayed desire to participate in this union, Zar Shah&apos;s arrest at this time is for that reason inadvisable and difficult. As regards statement that Zar Shah exhibited certain sentimental leaflets, he might have obtained printed manifesto bearing this friend&apos;s Royal Seal and expressing my Islamic sympathy and human feeling towards mankind and abhorrence of my Royal, mind of things affecting the faithful religion, freedom and liberty of human beings. In manifesto has been mentioned my unwillingness to interfere with any longer affairs of dominions of that friend or have any concern with them. By (Corrupt grouping Afghan tribes my object is not such as has been apprehended by Your Excellency. Object is to make them unite and co-operate with each other in safeguarding rights, independence and Ruler of their country, nation and Government of Afghanistan in maintaining peace on frontier and in guarding and protecting it from effect of quickly approaching revolutions.&quot; Your Excellency has written to inform me of receipt of my first and last Royal letters and of your becoming acquainted with appointment of Abdur Rahman Khan as envoy of my Government at Court of that friend&apos;s Government, &amp;c. It is matter for great surprise that Viceroy wrote a reply to our first letter after great delay, and that reply was not such as might have made our heart happy. As regards our second communication, which contained credentials of our envoy, it was essential for envoy to present it personally to the Viceroy ; but you had demanded that also before envoy&apos;s arrival at Simla. Envoy had, however, left for Simla before receipt of your telegram demanding credentials. Without talking to our envoy you have made reference in last letter to our third Royal letter in terms of (two corrupt groups) conditional on certain things the accomplishment of wdiich was difficult as mentioned above. /&quot; We have fully explained our objects in those letters and if you ask our. envoy for explanations he will furnish them clearly in detail. While Your Excellency should have recognised our Government as one absolutely independent of Governments with all honour and dignity in view of its important geographical and political situation it is to be regretted thousand times that it appears from Your Excellency&apos;s letter and intentions as if those hopes of ours which we had in friendly and united Government (corrupt group) were considered (corrupt group) dispersed. Government of Afghanistan in view of acquaintance and neighbourliness which it has had from long times past with exalted Government of Britannia by way of India has already expressed and. now expresses its willingness to conclude treaties and have friendly relations with your Government. Relying on the great respect and consideration which have for long times past existed between both parties, I hope that the friend will use his best and well-meaning endeavours and will to avert this very grave and dangerous state of affairs with great prudence by abolishing tyrannical laws and recognising absolute independence equal with those and (corrupt group) in all respects of Government of Afghanistan which is ready to conclude treaties and engage-ments in every way beneficial to each other so that the doors of calamity may not be opened upon the world for it is right to demand right and not right to shed blood without right in path of right.   Truth is (? but) not
delay is admissible. I hope confidently that Your Excellency will inform this friend without delay that kind friend will take the necessary measures in the matter.&quot; For the rest may the days of friendship endure for ever.&quot;Peshawar translation failed to reproduce Hasan Khan&apos;s admission of authenticity of firman and of stirring up the tribes.Amanulla&apos;s reference to his third letter is incomprehensible. Though present letter bears No. 4 we have not received No. 3.
