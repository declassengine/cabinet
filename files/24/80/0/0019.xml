i r.cnorandum by tho Hints tor of labour,fljho need for the appointment of Labour Attachos in the principal industrial countries has &quot;been increasingly felt &quot;by the Ministry, and I, therefore, desire cordially to support the rocommondations wade on thin subject in tlic scheme for the Reform of tho Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services submitted to tho Cabinet with Lord Curzo:at Minute G. PAd of tho e th of May.Tho reasons which make the appointment of Labour Attaches desirable seen to me to fall broadly under two heads, (a) oconoctlo, (b) political,(a) rioonomic.   The movement in tho direction of the international regulation of Labour mattcro, which was initiated by the Peace Confcrnooo, mokes it essential that tho Ministry of Labour should have the best and latest information at all tiaos diroctly available as to Labour developments in foreign countries.   The growing Importance of fee Labour factor in industry will&apos;make it in the future necessary to have full information as to the progress and offooto of&quot; movements towards higher wages, shorter hours, &amp;o.   In the past the Board of Trade had information on the efforts made by employers in foreign countries to increase efficiency and improve their position in tho world markets by introducing new machinery, new methods of organisation, &amp;o.   In the future it seems likely that labour costs and labour conditions will be the primary factor which have to bo taken into consideration in connection with foreign and commercial competition.   It is true that more reliable information from official sources will be available on many of these subjects when the International Labour office is established and is in &quot;full writing order.   But fthis is not all that, will be roquirod, if wc are to be able to make the most effective use of the International Labour Conforcnco and its machinery for maintaining the relative position of British industry In the worM&apos;s markets *  Wo shall not only require to know the official figures and the other data collected by the International Labour Office, but we shall desiro to have confidential reports from our own Officers as to the effect on industry of improvements in labour conditions, and to got timely warning of cases in which other countries are obtaining an unfair advantage through clinging to baokwnrd conditions in Industry.  Armed with this information we can thon set inter-national machinery in motion with a view to bringing backward States up to a hi$icr level, thus removing tho danger of unfair competition based on inflated wages or excessive hours of workoThese are also several questions which arc of interest to all industrial countries, but about which information cannot readily be obtained from official sources, o*g, it is of great interest and importance to have information as to any experiments in the direction of Joint con-&apos;:-vo\ ma industry abroad,   U?h:.s could not be obtained except by m of^;&apos;.oer -living in the country and   -endowed with an extensive to^Iod^o of industrial matters which would enable him to -j-ilg?. oorreetiy of the inpor*aneo of the facts which came to his notice*   It would be impossiblefor /
for an ordinary Diplomatic or Consular officer to present a Report on subJoeta of this kind which would have any value, unless ho hap-poned to bo thoroughly versed in Labour questions,(b)   Political. In all Labour movemonts tho political andeconomic &amp;FpeTcT*niro vory closely related *   It is impossible, to assess the probable economic results of a demand for shorter hours or higher wages, unless the political forco behind then can also bo accurately gauged.   (Phis is perhaps oven more tho caseon the Continent than in this country since abroad the labour movement is as yet more closely related to political than here, and attains flits objects more often by political than by economic action,   !Phe present trend in Labour politics is in tho direction of&apos;using industrial action as a means to promote political endslr It, therefore, appears to me of the highest importance that we should have Officers in tho principal industrial countries who are capable of assessing Labour movements both in their political and economic aspects at thoir true value, $his can only be done by mon who are thorou$oly acquainted with the atmosphere of Labour politics, and who will bo able to mix freely with Labour politicians abroad,   It is obviously impossible to expect this of the ordinary Diplomatic and consular Staffs. As the political importsnoo of Labour movements, both national and international, is growing rapidly, it would seem tot the Foreign Office ought to have the best firsthand information possible in regard to them, if it is to be able to gauge the attitude likely to be adopted on any givon quoutlon, oven a question of foroign politios. by countries in whioh there is a powerful Labour movotDcnt.   It may be true that tho Socialist Parties in Francs raid Italy have not produood the effect which they hoped on international relations, but they will not cease theiroefforts on that account, and are likely to be more successful in the future than they have bo en hitherto.Another point on which good information is of the first importance is in regard to the activities of the Extreme Left, which draws its inspiration front the Bolsheviks, and is now a serious factor in every European country as well as in the United States.   As long as tho present ferment continues it is unnecessary to emphasise the need for such information. Although much information can no doubt be gathered by the Secret Service.   I think that the opinion of a competent man able to distinguish clearly befcweon Moderates and Extremists in Latour politics would at least be a useful chec  on the Secret Service Reports.I, therefore, strongly support Sir Arthur Stccl-Hal&amp;land^ % proposal for the appointment of Labour Attaches, and agree v/ith him that, in the first instance, thoy should bo appointed ta-Washington, Berlin, Paris, Pctrcgrad or Kcscow, and 1&apos;olrlo.   To those Capitals I would suggest that Homo should be added, as the Socialist and Labour movement in it aly is at prosont-jmjDre powerful and perhaps likely to be more dangerous thanjrfn any of the Entente countries. &apos;The status of tho Labour Attaches should, I thinfc, bo similar to that of the Haval and Military Attaches, that is to say, t$at they would be part of the Diplomatic Staff of tfce Embassy or Legation to which they are attached, that they should report to tho Foreign Office&quot;with duplicate copies for transmission to the Ministry of Labour, ana&quot; should be appointed by this $opartmcmt in consultation with the- Foreign Office.I hope that the Cabinet will sec tiheir wa/&quot;to sanction this proposal at an early date. J(SICTSD)   B.S.HOKE21st May. 1919.
