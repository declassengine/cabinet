Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppel, dated to-day: &quot;Political Agent, Wano, wires :-&apos; Information was sent to me yesterday by Russell from Wano that reports have been received from Urghun that (? word omitted) had arrived there from Gurdez. I wired to [corrupt group] asking him whether he could confirm, but no reply has been received. Russell now wires arrival of GO cavalry, 2,000 infantry, and seven batteries is confirmed. Their object apparently is to attack Wano. [Corrupt group] is proceeding to Durand line to get news. I have informed Wazaristan force and stated that any preparations General Commanding wished to make should be made immediately. I should be glad to receive Chief Commissioners orders as^ regards action to be taken. Waziristan force has (instructed) mo to represent matter to Chief Commissioner if slightest likelihood of attack, as Nor front is not disposed to (reinforce ?) support troops up Gomal and cannot spare large force. Sarwekai, 20th May.&quot;1 &apos;This would appear to point more to attack on Tochi than on Wano, hut clear definition of policy is required in both cases. I have conferred with Army Commander whose views are embodied in following order to General Officer Commanding, Waziristan, repeated to War Section :-;&quot; 3567 G.S. In view of impossibility of holding lines of communication up the Gomal to Wano in? the event of entry of Afghan forces into that neighbourhood and.of being joined by tribal forces, it will be necessary to evacuate Wano Sarwekai and the Gomal posts. This should be carried out in sufficient time to give Such of garrison(s) as remain loyal chance to withdraw in safety into the Zhob or to Murtaza. Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province is informing Political Agent, Wano, of these orders. Same orders apply to Tochi as regards all posts above Miranshah. Before evacuating posts everything of value should be destroyed. Senior officers in the Wano and Tochi (? agencies) will.decide when the evacuation should be carried out.   Addressed General, Waziristan, repeated War Section.&quot;(? Acting on the advice of) these orders, [. have sent following orders to Political Agents, Tochi and Wano : &quot; When emergency contemplated in Army commander&apos;s 3507 G.S., repeated to (?you) and [corrupt group] you will take action as follows : Political Agent, Wano. You should, in consultation with Commandant, South Waziristan Militia, hold on to Sarwekai and Gomal posts as long as seems reasonably safe, and be prepared to with-draw in time to destroy everything of value to enemy and hand over posts to Mahsuds and Waziri if any are still friendly, under promise of very handsome rewards for custody. You will use your discretion regarding withdrawing men to Wano or Murtaza from various posts, withdrawing to Murtaza if possible. As regards Wano similar procedure should be adopted, and in emergency you should withdraw to Zhob. Remember that it is no use hold(ing) on to Wano to the end, as there is no possibility of relief. Wait as long as is reasonably safe, as operations on Dakka and Jalalabad front have been - so successful, that they may upset whole Afghan plan of campaign, but if in your opinion, and that of senior military officer,, position becomes so bad that there is any chance of your being besieged, you should, with all men remaining loyal, retreat to ?Zhob, carrying enough rations to take you there, and destroy as much as you can before leaving. Political Agent, Tochi. All posts above Miranshah should be evacuated under orders of General Officer Commanding, and men withdrawn if the position becomes critical. Posts above Miranshah should either be handed over to friendly Wazirs, if any, with promise of lavish rewards for custody, or abandoned. In either case,- everything of value to enemy should be destroyed. I realise that these orders put very heavy responsibility both on you and Crosthwaite, but this cannot be helped. Everything depends on your accurate appreciation of the situation. Our military success on the Dakka front has quite upset Afghan plan of campaign, and it is possible that no serious attack may be made on Tochi or Wano. On the other hand, if you delay too long (?you may) give enemy success of taking garrison which cannot possibly be relieved. Keep me fully informed by telegraph, and Political Agent, Wano, may tell all men in Southern Waziristan Militia who remain staunch in the event of retreat becoming necessary that lucrative employment awaits them in Peshawur and that they will be handsomely rewarded.&quot;
