From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 21th May 1.910. (Received 28th, 11.30 a.m:)Secret.   Afghanistan.  Following from Roos-Keppel: &quot;(1) No. 1461 dated 26th May. Situation throughout North-West Frontier Province was all could be desired until yesterday, and to-day all is well in northern half. Yesterday Afghan forces seemed to be retiring or stationary on all fronts. . All tribes were in a good mood and there seemed to be no prospect of trouble, but I have just learnt that the General Officer Commanding, Tochi, withdrew garrisons of all posts in Upper Tochi and on Thal-Idak line. Upper posts were immediately occupied and burnt by Mahsuds and Wazirs/, and Spinwam was occupied by Afghans. Political Agent, Wano, wired at 18.45 hours yesterday that all was well. Mulla Hamzulla disappointed with attitude of Mahsuds had gone home and troops leaving urgently. Attitude of Mahsuds and Wazir good. He wired again at 1.15 hours to-day that he had received information of evacuation of Tochi posts, and that although no signs were visible of any change among ? Mahsuds who appeared quite quiet, the news was bound to. affect them. He wired again at ? 10.25 hours to-day that in his opinion and that of Commandant, Southern Waziristan Militia, and Assistant Political Agent, Mahsuds and Waziris would rise immediately on receipt of Tochi news and that they agreed it had become necessary to evacuate posts immediately. Kurram wires that Kabul Khel Wazirs have patched up their private feuds, agreed to join Afghans if latter enter Waziristan. We may presume that General Nadir Khan will now move on Tochi as the great miscalculation of the Afghan plan of campaign up to now has been failure to induce tribes to rise. Political situation in southern half of Province has gone in one night from &quot;set-fair&quot; to &quot;stormy&quot; and we must prepare for probable eventuality of a general Mahsud and Wazir rising which may spread, to Sheranni, Bhittani and possibly to Zhob.&quot;(2) No. 1465 (R.), dated 26th May : &quot; Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, saw jirgas of Halimzai, Tarakzai, Isakhel, Burhaii Khel, Mohmands and reports they have behaved excellently through the late disturbances. Had they shown any inclination to join Afghan troops and lashkar in Gandab latter would certainly have attacked, but steadiness of our lower Mohmands combined with nervousness of Aghans about their line of retreat and messages describing destruction Jalalabad induced whole enemy force to retire without attacking. [ am going to Shabkadr on 28th instant to see whole jirga of our Mohmands in the Khyber Agency. Afridis have undertaken to guard road between Jamrud and Ali Masjid as far as possible, and have placed tribal pickets 1,000 yards beyond our pickets to prevent snipers getting through. Political Agent, Khyber, has handsomely rewarded Zakka Khel of Bazar for bringing in without ransom two captured flying corps officers. Kurram reports Gabar Mangals lashkar has started for Khost to join Nadir Khan. Tochi and Wano situation already reported in my 1461 R. Later news is that Afghans have advanced from Spinwam to a point within seven miles of Idak on the Tochi road and that Wazir lashkars from Khaisora side are assembling to attack Miranshah. Bajaur Khans with their lashkars and Salarzai lashkar started towards Mohmand country, but were met by messengers who told them Amir had asked for peace, upon which they returned. Elsewhere all quiet.&quot;Following from Baluchistan, No. 51. F., dated 26th May : &quot;Zhob news. Jacob has received letter from Fateh Khan and other Saraz headmen, expressing loyalty and no intention of giving trouble, though they cannot come&apos;in through fear of Afghan authorities. Whole country round Zarmelan quiet.&quot;Following from Meshed, dated 26th May:  &quot; All quiet in Herat up to&apos;21st May.&quot;
