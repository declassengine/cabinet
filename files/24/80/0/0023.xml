Attitude of the population of Munich towards the Army of Occupation and towards the Prussians.1. The capture of Munich by the combined troops of the Bavarian Hoffmann Government and the Wurttemberg and Prussian Governments on the 1st and 2nd May probably heralds the triumph of law and order in Bavaria to the same extent at least as law and order were secured in Berlin by the suppression of the Spartacist rising in the middle of March. The history of the events in Munich since the assassination of the first revolutionary Prime Minister, Kurt Eisner, on the. 21st February is obscure, and accounts vary as to the names of the adventurers who successively obtained control of the Government or of the Bed troops. There can be no doubt that the Russian element was very active and influential. Levien&apos;s name does not at first figure as that of an actual holder of office, but his turbulent influence ;was everywhere present, and another Russian, named Axelrode, appears to have conducted communications by wireless with Moscow and with Budapest. At one stage some hundreds of Russian prisoners interned in one of the suburbs were set at liberty, a Russian guard was established at the central railway station and took part in the fighting. Few of the German names which are mentioned in connection with the Soviet usurpation convey any idea of the tendencies which alternately predominated. A student, appropriately named Toller (madman), emerged as leader of the Independent Socialists and commander of the Red Guard, and wanted to negotiate with the Hoffmann Government, which had withdrawn to Bamberg on the 4th. April after the Soviet troops had occupied the Parliament House. There was a violent public conflict between Toller and Levien in the last week of April; extreme counsels ultimately prevailed; and skirmishes between the Soviet troops and the approaching forces of the Government, with their German allies, were of daily occurrence until the final collapse on the 1st May. All the leaders in Munich seem to have been pure adventurers like Gustav Landauer, Erich Muehsam, and Dr. Lipp. There was also a former bank clerk who took charge of the finances, but was unable to emulate the achievements of Lenin in this sphere, as the Hoffmann Government had removed the plates for printing paper money to Bamberg. Muehsam was a Bohemian frequenter of the Berlin cafes, who before the war had conducted anarchist propaganda and written anarchist verses.*v 2. From no place in Germany not even Brunswick or Bremen has so muchfalse and confused news been disseminated as from Munich. Accounts differ as to the dates of events, but the following seem to have been the chief stages in the evolution of the Soviet movement: (a.) From 21st March to 17th March there was a temporary upheaval of the Spartacist and Communist elements, consequent upon the legiti mate&quot;indigna-tion of the masses at the assassination of Eisner. The Central Council of the [1130]-641 B
Munich Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils seems to have sat continuously, and to have set up successive &quot; governments,&quot; in which the names of Niekisch, Gandorfer (leader of the Bavarian Peasants&apos; League) and Siegetz appear. The policy of Gandorfer at this and later stages was influenced by the fact that the Extremists of all shades agreed with the peasants in one important point the advocacy of Bavarian particularism against Imperial centralisation and Prussian influence. The Moderates, on the other hand, led by Hoffmann and Auer,* were in constant communication with the Imperial Government at Berlin or Weimar, and were inclined to accpiiesce in the programme of more pronounced centralisation, which Ebert and Scheidemann represent. (?;.) With the consent of the Soviets, or of a section of them, the Bavarian Diet, in which there is a bourgeois majority, mostly Catholics, resumed its sittiugs on the 17th March, and Hoffmann was chosen Minister-President, with a Cabinet containing Majority and Minority Socialists. Hoffmann tried to co-operate with the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils on the lines which had previously been followed with some success by Eisner, but the attempt ended in failure.(c.) On the 4th April, encouraged by the success of a Soviet revolution at Augsburg, Niekisch, President of the Central Council of Workmen and Soldiers, attempted to establish a Soviet Government. It is noteworthy that Niekisch is a Majority Socialist and indeed all through the strict lines of party were obliterated. He was opposed by the Communists under Levien and by a section of the Independent Socialists, who urged, truly enough, that Munich and Bavaria were not ripe for a Sovdet Government. But he persisted, and, in order to give the Extremists a certain eclat beyond the frontiers, Dr. Muehlon was invited to become Minister-President, a proposal which, after some hesitation, he declined. (d.) Next day, the 5th April, Niekisch&apos;s scheme collapsed. At a conference of the Central Council of Workmen and Soldiers with various leaders of the two Socialist parties, Levien carried the day by insisting that a Soviet Republic could not be maintained without a powerful organisation, for which the masses were not yet prepared. On behalf of the Communists he declined to co-operate. Dr. Lipp, however, presented a revolutionary programme of twelve points, which was accepted by the delegates of the Majority Socialists, and a professedly Soviet regime was set up at the instance of Gustav Landauer, President of the Council of Revolutionary Workmen, and of Erich Muehsam, the Bohemian frequenter of literary cafes and writer of revolutionary verses. Dr. Lipp, who has repeatedly been interned in lunatic asylums, and has behind him a career of, a dubious character during the war as an agent in Italy for the old Imperial regime, was appointed President and Minister for Foreign Affairs. An Argentinian, Silvio Gesell. was Finance Minister, and a Czech, Paulukum, Minister of &apos; Communications.   This was the, first Munich Soviet Republic.3.$The first Soviet Republic lasted from the 5th April to the 12th April. It was a caricature even of Sovietism. Its chief activity consisted in plastering the buildings of Munich with proclamations of the decrees issued by the Central Council. There was one which commanded.the bourgeois to disarm. Another announced the formation of a Red Army and the establishment of a revolutionary Court of Justice. A third published the text of the fraternal greetings which had been received by wireless from the Governments of Moscow and Budapest. The press of all parties was commandeered, and was compelled b)T way of a propaganda to publish futurist wood-cuts -a Munich speciality. The President and Foreign Minister, Dr. Lipp, addressed rollicking notes to the diplomatic representatives of foreign States, including one in Italian to the Papal Nuncio, and another recalling the Bavarian Minister in Berlin, and beginning with the words, &quot; Opus primum nec non ultimum.&quot;Meanwhile, on the 4th or 5th &quot;April, Hoffmann, with his ministry of law and order, had migrated to Bamberg, whither he was followed by the great majority of the Diet. The Diet had really no choice, since on the 4th April the troops which were in sympathy with the Soviets had occupied the Parliament House and had ejected the deputies.* Auer was still in hospital suffering- from the wounds he] received when the Assembly was dispersed by Spartacists on the 21st February, buc his influence was reasserting&apos; itself.
4. Hoffmann at first pursued a waiting policy, as the Bavarian troops at the disposal of the Government were in a demoralised condition and could not be depended upon. In view of the political advantage which the Extremists in Munich and other cities derived from their professions of Bavarian particularism, he for a time hesitated to call in the assistance of Prussian or other non-Bavarian troops, although Noske, the energetic Imperial Minister of Defence, had publicly announced the readiness of the German Imperial Government to send military aid. The Government of Wtirttemberg likewise declared its sympathy and willingness to co-operate, while the Baden Govern-ment, although sympathetic, declined to intervene. . The attitude of the Bavarian Catholic Centre, the strongest party in the Diet, was probably in the end decisive on this point. The Catholic leaders dislike Prussia, but they dislike Bolshevism more. Eventually Hoffmann overcame the reluctance of his &quot; Minister for Military Affairs,&quot; Schneppenhorst, to form a force of volunteers on the lines adopted by the Imperial Government, and he likewise accepted the assistance of Wurttemberg and addressed a request for troops to the Empire. The first result of the new policy was the occupation of Augsburg by the Government forces and the ejection of the local Soviet on the 2.3rd April.5. In the opinion of some neutral observers on the spot, the first Munich Soviet Government, which is described as &quot; the premature work of a group of anarchist intellectuals,&quot; would have collapsed of itself, owing to its incompetence and to popular ridicule, if Hoffmann had been content to wait a little longer. But before he was strong enough to act with effect he tried about the 10th April the effect of bluff. The Majority Socialist, Dr. Loewenfeld, went to confer with him at Bamberg, and returned with full powers to organise an anti-Soviet movement. He was provided with a large sum of money, which enabled him to secure the adhesion of two or three of the regiments quartered in Munich. At 10 o&apos;clock on the evening of the 11th April some of these troops made their way into the Wittelsbach Palace, where the Central Council was sitting, and took half of its members prisoners. Muehsam, Landauer, and another councillor were transported to Passau, while Dr. Lipp was once more interned in a lunatic asvlum.6. This was the end of the first Soviet Republic. Munich was placarded next day (12th April) with the announcement, &quot; in the name of the garrison,&quot; that, the Hoffmann Government had been reinstated. But this was merely a flash in the pan. The effect of Hoffmanns-action without adequate forces to back it up was to unite the whole of the extreme elements, including the Bolshevik Communists led by the Russian, Levien, whoTiad hitherto held aloof from Dr. Lipp and his motley Soviet Council. Handbills were distributed convoking a mass meeting on the Theresienwiese, wdiere, it may be remembered, the original Bavarian revolution was born under the auspices of Eisner on the 8th November, 1918. This meeting was held on Sunday, the 13th April, while in the centra] streets of the city Communist orators harangued smaller crowds, and motor waggons tilled with armed workmen careered through the streets. There was at least one collision attended with bloodshed during the afternoon between the Govern-ment troops and the Communists. It was in the evening,that the decisive encounter took place. Workmen and soldiers were returning from the Theresienwiese meeting. A waggonload of soldiers was passing the Central railway station, from which peaceable excursionists were emerging on their return from their Sunday outing. The station buildings had been occupied by the Hoffmann Government troops under one Aschenbrenner, and a shot was fired from one of the windows at the Communist soldiers in the waggon. The soldiers stopped and sent a deputation into the building to demand the surrender of Aschenbrenners force. Aschenbrenner&apos;s reply was to shoot three of the deputation on the spot. The Red Army was thereupon called out and the station besieged. It was only after trench mortars had been employed that the garrison capitulated, while its leader, Aschenbrenner, fled on a locomotive. A good deal of damage had been done to the station and the neighbouring buildings, and the Workmens and Soldiers&apos; force had lost forty-five men killed.The Ked troops next visited the different barracks, where they obtained the capitulation of suspect regiments. The revolutionary Committees of Workmen and Soldiers met in the night and constituted a new Government, among whose members were Levien and his Russian colleagues, Levine-Nissen and Axelrode, together with the sailor, Egelhofer, who had organised the pre-revolution mutinies at Kiel at the end of October and beginning of November 1918.This was the second Soviet Government, and this time it was Sovietism, Communism, Bolshevism in deadly earnest, as the bourgeois of Munich soon realised to their cost.[1130]- 641
7. Russian models were followed. The pay and allowances of the Red Army were raised to 10 (ultimately to 20) marks a day, apart from allowances to wives and children. The soldiers, as at Moscow, had to be fed. first, and, as the supplies from the country became scarcer and scarcer, the rest of the population began to experience something like famine. It is true that-the Hoffmann Government, even when it hud collected sufficient forces to begin the investment of Munich, did not cut off supplies  presumably on humanitarian grounds, or because so many of its friends were in the beleaguered city, But the peasants, some of whom had at-first supported the Soviet Government on account of its political particularism, changed their opinions, partly under the influence of their priests, and partly because of the raids for food which were made upon their farms by armed Communists. They refused to supply the city with provisions. Towards the end of April, according to the statement of farmers in the neighbourhood of Munich, many of the bourgeois class began to come out and supplicate them with tears for a little food to ward off starvation. The commandeering of the houses of the well-to-do became frequent. The Government attempted to confiscate deposits in the banks, but found that there was very little to seize. Orders to open the bank safes and surrender plate and other valuables which had been deposited were successfully resisted. The feeling prevailed among the bourgeois that unless speedy help came from without their fate would be as tragic as that of the population of Petrogracl. The working classes themselves began to suffer from increasing unemploy-ment owing to the total interruption of the supplies of raw material and coal. The trade unions, though reluctant to pronounce against the Soviet system, began to criticise it. At times the Soviet leaders were able to leave Munich on locomotives and to proceed along the deserted railwav lines to other towns in order to spread their agitation. The movement to establish a Soviet Government in Nuremberg and to declare a general strike failed owing to the presence of adequate Government forces. There was a Spartacist outbreak at Lindau on the Lake of Constance, and one of the passenger steamers was seized, but was bombarded and prevented from continuing its operations. About the middle of April there was an encounter between Soviet and Government troops at Dachau, near .Munich, when the Government forces were defeated in consequence of their unwillingness to risk the destruction of the place by prolonging the struggle in the neighbourhood of the powder works.8. As the investment by Bavarian, Prussian, and Wurttemberg troops became closer, dissensions broke out among the Soviet councillors. The student Toller, who had obtained command of the Red Army, desired to prevent further bloodshed and to negotiate with the Hoffmann Government. The Prussian troops under General von Owen were the first to enter the city from the north. Never before had Prussian troops been seen in Munich, and it is significant that they were joyfully-welcomed by the population. It was in vain that the rump of the Soviet issued proclamations against the &quot; White Guards&quot; and &quot; Prussian domination.&quot; By the 2nd May the whole of the northern portion of the town had been occupied, as well as the Isar bridges and the Wittelsbach Palace. The Red Army, the original strength of which had been estimated-probably over-estimated-at from 20,000 to 25,000 men, had. partly dispersed, though a section of it still occupied the eastern districts. Most of the leaders had fled, but some of them were captured in the city or in villages where they had sought safety. It is said that Egelhofer and Landauer were summarily executed. The Russian Bolshevist, Axelrode, was stopped at the Swiss frontier, but was afterwards allowed to pass, as his father hud acquired Swiss nationality. Levien and Levine-Nissen are among those who have not yet been captured.When the struggle became desperate the Bolshevik leaders had caused several bourgeois to be interned as hostages. On the 30th April a number of these, including a Prince of Thurn and Taxis, a Professor Berger, and a Countess Westarp, were brutally murdered in the Leopoldsgymnasium.9. The result of the Soviet episode at Munich, so far as can at present be seen, is to strengthen the cause if law and order throughout Germany, and to discredit Bolshevism and Spartacism with the masses. It was only in Munich, with its atmosphere-phere of reckless and irresponsible Bohemianism, that an experiment of this kind could he made, and that persons of the type of Lipp, Muehsam, Levien, and Levine-Nissen could temporarily rise to power. When the Soviet Government was not indulging in buffoonery or brutality its time was occupied with endless internal wrangiings. In Munich experiments in Communism could for a. few weeks be attempted. But no satisfactory answer was discovered to the question which Lenin asked by wireless from.
Moscow How the Soviet Government intended. to carry out the socialization of agriculture in Bavaria ? The only decree which was issued on this subject .took into account the interests of the Bavarian peasant proprietors and exempted from socialization all holdings below 1,000 Tagwerk. A second result of the Munich episode is that the unity of the new German Empire has been considerably promoted. A number of the Bavarian peasant farmers dallied for a time with Sovietism first, because the Hoffman Government had shown itself weak and wanting in initiative; and, secondly, because the Soviets made a stand against interference from Berlin or Weimar. In the end the vast majority of the urban and rural population came to the conclusion that order and safety were only to be secured by - the intimate co-operation of the German States with the Imperial Government. This, from the German point of view, is a gain beyond anything which was achieved in. Bavaria, by the old Imperial regime. At its utmost expansion in Bavaria the Soviet movement only found serious support (outside Munich) at Augsburg and in the south, and at Wiirzburg, Schweinfurt, and Aschaffenburg. Nuremberg for a time was doubtful, as the local Soviet managed to inspire terror, but in the end forces of law and order triumphed. The example of Hungary exercised a demoralising influence, as did the general unsettlement in Germany, the frequent strikes in German cities and in the mining districts, and the attempt of the Scheidemann Government to compromise with the Councils by accepting an amendment to Article 34 of the new Constitution, giving them an economic and political status.With regard to the influence of the events in Munich upon the attitude of the German people towards the Peace Terms, it may be conjectured that attention has been concentrated upon the problem of internal reconstruction to an extent which will make the masses unwilling to commit themselves to a policy of active or passive resistance to the Allies, arid also make the Government reluctant to cause further excitement and unrest by taking a referendum upon the Paris Peace or even organizing a general agitation against it.P.S. A telegram from Munich dated the 4th May* describes the popular attitude towards the different contingents of the army of occupation as follows : This morning (Sunday, the 4th May) there seems for the moment to be absolute tranquillity, Sunday crowds for the first time filled the boulevards and welcomed with shouts and waving of handkerchiefs the troops which were marching in. Austrians, German Bohemians, and the Volunteer Corps of Peasants from Suabia, the Werdenfels district and Rosenheim were cordially greeted. Those troops winch distinguished themselves in the fighting of the last few days were particularly feted. About noon the bands played and the public joined in singing &quot; Deutschland, Deutschland december Alles.&quot; All the same, one could see that many a spectator was clenching his fist in his pocket. The bourgeoisie, which was intimidated and alarmed during the weeks of the Councils sway, once more ventured out.   Many who had sought safety in the country and in the mountainvillages had returned, so far as railway communications permitted.....As wenoted yesterday, there has been a change in the attitude of a section of the population towards the Prussians who marched in with troops of the Hoffmann Government. Reference is made to this in the manifesto addressed by the Bavarian. Commander-in-Chief, General von Moehl, to the inhabitants of Munich. The manifesto, says : &quot; A mischievous agitation against the &apos; Prussians &apos; is going on. It must be combated by every possible means, and particularly by the arrest of persons who have taken a prominent part in it. One of the reports which is being circulated is to the effect that the North German Imperial troops are eating up our provisions. This is nonsense; the troops carry their own rations with them. Moreover, they have opened doors by which ampler supplies than were hitherto available are being brought into the city. In a few days the city will notice the results. This is another reason why the population should be grateful to the North German troops.&quot;According to other accounts, the severity with which those responsible for the recent excesses, and especially those who were in any way connected with the murder of the hostages, are being hunted down and executed is said to be laid to the charge of the Prussians.   There has also been the distressing spectacle of damage to buildings by* &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; May 5, evening edition, No. 332.
the use of artillery, and possibly by bombs dropped by aeroplanes which took part in the fighting. But this damage is said to be far less than that which Berlin suffered during the suppression of the Spartacists in March. The loss of life on both sides, as far as can be gathered from isolated details, amounts to a few hundreds of killed, but a good many wounded have been treated in the hospitals.It is stated that the Berlin Government will now insist upon the abolition of all separate Bavarian military organisation and upon the unreserved incorporation of the Bavarian units in the Imperial Militia (&quot; Reichswehr &quot;).Details have just arrived of the&apos; massacre of twenty-one members of the Catholic Society, the Munich Francis Joseph Union, who were mistaken for Spartacists by Prussian troops and arrested at their meeting-place. Thence they were marched to the Prince George Palace and shot in a dark cellar. The actual executioners are said to have been Bavarian troops, but the part played by the Alexander Guards Regiment from Berlin in the arrest and internment of the victims, among whom were women, has intensified the movement against the Prussians. The writer of this Memorandum does not share the view widely held in France that dissensions among the German States and particularism are in the political or economic interest of the Allies.o9
