fcABINlX This r^nment \s th*. J** &apos; j /-^ ^ \ ift^yS!J (Received io.4U a.m., 26th.)L^av^gcret.   Afghanistan.  Following from Roos-Keppel 23rd May      This morning ftYl IM&amp;-^$tnrc Rahman Khan, Afghan envoy, left for Dakka with the reply of Government of-&quot;India which was communicated to him last night.   His three companions are detained here in the fort, two of them asked for an interview with me and I have had long conversations with them this morning.   They are Sardar. Habibulla Khan, grandchild of Gnl Muhammad Khan Zi and nephew of Mahmnd Zi.   He describes himself as Telegraph Master-General of Afghanistan ; the second is Colonel Ahmad, Ali&apos;s brother, Colonel Ali Ahmad and grandchild of Sardar Mahomed Rafiq Khan Lodi.   The third, whom I did not see, is Abdul Aziz Sarhdar.   llabibulla produced a firman from the Amir of which the following is the text:  &apos; To Habibulla Khan, Superintendent of the post offices, and Colonel Ahmad Ali, Supervisor (Khan).    As Abdur Rahman Khan, who was appointed Afghan envoy with the Government of India and has returned from there has informed me on his departure, the Foreign Secretary discussed with him the question of ceasing war and opening the door of peace, I therefore depute and authorise you to go to the field of battle to the British camp and to discuss the terms and Mugarrarat of peace, and if you find grounds for peace favourable, inform, me of the matter.   At any rate it is necessary and I authorise you to take these steps.   Amir Amanulla Sihshamba nineteenth. Shaban 1337.&apos;  Habibulla Khan is a man about fifty ; he has resided for many years in Turkey and is far more intelligent and polished than the average Afghan Sardar.   He is a pleasant man to deal with and we had a long and interesting conversation.   I informed him beforehand that I had no authority to negotiate hut could merely discuss matters with him in a friendly spirit and represent anything he wished to say to the Government of India.   At first he took line that the outbreak of hostilities was a misunderstanding for which&apos;the British were responsible, hut as he found this position untenable he fell back on the argument that there were faults on both sides, and stated that General Saleh Muhammad Khan had been sent to Kabul under arrest.   As a matter of fact I think that he has merely gone to Kabul because he is too severely wounded to carry on his duties.   He says that he and Colonel Ali Ahmad are authorised to negotiate, but that Abdur Rahman&apos;s object was merely to return to his post at Simla which he has never abandoned, his journey to Kabul being at the request of the Foreign Secretary that he might give Amir private assurances.   By this ingenious argument he explains retention at Kabul of Hafiz Saifulla Khan, arguing firstly until written declarations of Avar have been exchanged between Afghan and British Governments a state of war cannot exist; secondly, that what has happened in various parts of frontier are merely local incidents ; thirdly, that we are still at peace with Afghanistan technically and that therefore the two envoys remain at their posts.   I informed him that this was not the view of the Government&apos; of India in the matter, and he said he would write at once asking Amir to send down Saifulla Khan immediately, as his remaining at Kabul was being misunderstood.   I advised him strongly to do so, and he said that he would, hut that he must first consult his colleague Ali Ahmad.   I pointed out to him although we had not received formal declaration of war from Amir, Afghan troops had encroached and fought within our boundaries at Landi Kotal and were at this moment in our tribal territory on the Mohmand border and in Kurram that (? three) armies had come to different points of the Afghan border and were lavishly distributing arms and ammunition amongst our tribes, obviously intended to be used against us ; also that for some time before the actual outbreak of hostilities, Afghan, officials in India had been occupied in violent anti-British propaganda, and that we had to be on the watch for written proofs of this.   He said that he knew nothing of the propaganda in India&quot; as that was not his department, and that other military movements in Afghanistan were in some cases due to misunderstandings which could easily be set right, and in others merely defensive measures necessitated by our bombing of Dakka and Jalalabad.   He said quite frankly that the effect of bombing Jalalabad was very great, and that practically whole place was in ruins.   He explained that his mission was to suggest armistice while a mixed Commission enquired into the causes of the outbreak of hostilities and arranged terms of peace. v Second man, Ali Ahmad, is younger and rather typical Afghan official inclined to be aggressive and argumentative.   He stuck that we had wantonly beguu hostilities, and I did not think it worth while to argue this point with him.   (? Both) Sardars, whom I saw separately and who had no communication with each other between their interviews with me, stated that Nasrulla Khan is well but under strict confinement, that Inayatulla Khan is well but under surveillance, but could not be (four corrupt groups).   They request that they may be sent (for) to Simla.   Military authorities here are anxious to get rid of them from fort, but I could not allow them to be at large here or give them any opportunity of com-communicating with Peshawar city.&quot;Both men are being put across the frontier and informed that there is nothing to add to written message given to Abdur Rahman.   24th May.
