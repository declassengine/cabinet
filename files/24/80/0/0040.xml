THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHITANMIC MAJESTY1 S GOVggMjjgW,&apos;SECRET. \\ WAR   CABINET.G.T.7359.OP SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL OFFICER,&apos;Memorandum by the Po s trna 31 er Goner a 1.The Post Office employs a large number of scientific and engineering officers, mainly engaged upon the technical side of Telegraphs, Telephones and Wireless Telegraphy.I agree that the time is ripe for a general investigation and co-ordination of the salaries paid to technical experts, and I concur in the suggestion that a representative Committee should be appointed for the purpose.But in the Post Office, and probably in other Departments, I think It will be&quot; extremely difficult to draw a precise line between scientific experts and other sections of the staff, many of whom are &quot;engaged on technical duties to a greater or less degree.     Any extensive revision of the salaries paid to the staff will necessarily re-act upon the standard of remuneration of the administrative staff and it may be desirable that, if a Committee is appointed, its terms of reference should be sufficiently wide to cover both.(Signed) ALBERT II. ILLIOTORTH.General Post Office. g.C.l. 26th May, 1919.
