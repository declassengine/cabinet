The Committee had under consideration a memorandum by the Minister of Pensions (Paper No: 138) making recommendations for -



(a) An increase in the pensions of widows of officers and naval warrant officers who died in consequence of former wars.



(b) An increase in the pensions of officers, naval warrant officers and nurses with specific wounds, or totally disabled by disease, in former wars.



(c) An increase in the pensions of officers, naval warrant officers, nurses and men suffering from disabilities in consequence of former wars other than the disabilities in (b) above.



(d) A temporary 20 per cent. bonus on pensions for former wars.



Mr. Forster said that he thought the result of granting the present proposals would be a tremendous number of applications for the re-examination of old cases.



The Minister of Pensions pointed out that this pressure could be resisted on the grounds that the Ministry of Pe4nsions were unable to reconstitute the case. The argument in favour of his proposals was that the same privileges should be extended to officers as had already been granted to men.


r4 Z - ,MR,WAtE91?:I3SL]), referring to the third proposal, namely, to increase the pensions of officers, naval warrant officers, nurses and men suffering from disabilities in consequence of former wars, enquired whether it would he possible tfc differ-fctiate &quot;between disease due to war and disease actually con-tracted in peace time.    This applied particularly.in the case of officers.    There had &quot;been a number of cases of officers who had retired not on account of disablement in former wars, hut on account of disease contracted on service in the ordinary way.THE MINISTER OF PiSHSIOHS pointed, out that it was not in-tended to bring in new beneficiaries. His proposals were to increase to the rates granted for the present war, pensionsthat fww fclmty isa fcxtqtwe,MS,WAMHBLD said that fte had in mind tfce oas$ of anofficer who might perhaps have had  his constitution undermined in the Boer War, although not sufficiently badly to he retired from the service.     Some lime   afterwards his disability might. -have developed from another   cause to such an extent as to compel his retirement.    !t would be found difficult.to resist the claim of such a man *o have his retired pay brought   up to the new rate in view of the fact that.his disability, al-though not actually occurring during the   war period,, had been occasioned by the war.THE HDJISTSR 01- PSKSIOHS pointed out that   the pension drawn by such an officer was entirely a service pension and thus did not come within the scope of-his present./proposals. He would, however, lops into this matter again with a view to ascertaining whether-^here   was any chance of its giving rise to any considerable nianber of claims.*.* \UJR.vaT-SfI4LD said that he was instructed by the Treasury to object to the fourth proposal, namely, a temporary bonus of 20 per cent, on pensions for former wars.     If it were agreed t it &quot;^uld be impossible to resist claims put forward for a war
u* g **bonus on all kinds of annuities.     In the joase of the        ! Civil service it had been decided that the pensions grarrt-od sinoo the introduction of tho war bonus&apos; should bo assessed on the total pay (including bonus) that the pen-sioner was drawing.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, had deoided that this concossion could not &quot;be granted to pensioners who had left the Service before It was introduced,     Pm-thsr he suggested that the inorease to tho present cubstantivo rate of pensions under the Pensions Warrants was sufficient concession in itself with-out the necessity for an additional bonus.    ;&amp;or example, tho Minister of Pensions had instanoed the case of an effi-cer whose retired pay would be increased from 3/- a day ( 55 per annum) to  175 per annum.     It was surely pushing logic too far to say :that because the one increase was granted tho second must necessarily follow.The Minister of Pensions said that this objection had been advanced on previous occasions when he had proposal a War Bsnus on pensions.    The answer to-day was just the same and equally strong as that which had been given before, namely, that the proposal was to grant the war bonus only on disability pension.I)r.lv!acnamara said that he welcomed the present proposal since it was yet another argument in favour of increasing the pensions of all men on the rolls 7/herever a new basic rate was set up.The Committee decided:-I   (a)      That the widows of subalterns who were fcilled in action or died of wounds in former wars should be raised to the rate they would have received had their ^husbands held  the rank of captain.(b)      That the widows cf effioers to whom the inter-mediate rate of pension was granted because their husbands died in consequence of former wars should be granted the rate laid down in the scale for this war.(o)      That widows of Haval Commissioned Warrant andWarrant Officers who lost their lives in former wars should be granted the pensions they would have received in the present war.
II. That tho retired $ay of officers and the pensions of nurses, naval commisjioaefi warrant and warrant officers with specific wounds or injuries duo to service in former wars (as detailed in the first Schedule of the Royal Warrant of April 17/1918) or who are totally incapacitated by any disability due directly and wholly to such&apos;service should be increased to the rates provided for the present war,III, That the retired pay of officers and the pensions of nurses, naval commissioned warrant and warrant officers and men partially disabled by wounds or injuries (other than those in II above) or from disease directly and wholly duo to service in former wars should be increased to the rates they would have been receiving had they been.sim-ilarly disabled in the present war,Hote^  This recommendation was agreed to by the committee subject to the Minister of Pensions so defining its scope as to confine its application strictly to those cases where disability pension on account of former wars is actually being received, and to admit of no claims for reconsideration of cases al-ready decide^The Committee farther requested the Minister of Pensions to consult with the   Treasury in order to obtain a form of words which would ensure this bein^ done.yThat a temporary bonns of - 20 per cent, be added to (a) the pensions increased under I to III above and&apos; (h) to retired pay or pensions beixtff drawn by other officers, nurses, naval commissioned warrant and v/arrant officers disabled in consequence of former wars, and to the pensions being drawn by the widows children or other relatives (mothers and sisters) of officers who died in consequence of former wars.The-War Bonus to he granted under the same condi-tions as apply to the grant of a war bonus in the case of pensions awarded on account of the present war.V. That these increases should have effect from April1st, 1919.Mr,Waterfield,.representing the Treasury^ desires that Ms dissent from decisions III, and IV be recorded.SES UNjDIRS.     The Minister of Pensions said that there were a certain 8 DISP3HS-1(3 WAERANTnumber of cases in which the loss of limb or other serious injury had bean sustained through the performance of military or naval duty in peace time.    He desired that these cases should, be treated under the Dispensing Warrant and the pan-sions increased to the rates, pins bonus, which would have been granted if the disability ho,d been incurred in this war.    Any grants under the Dispensing Warrant were made hy
Treasury, and he had to refer all cases   to that Department.Mr.Waterfield asked whether, if the Committee decided to make a recommendation on this matter, they also wished to recommend that   the Treasury should authorise the grant of pension under  the Dispensing Warrant in cases where at present they had refused to sanction any such grant, for example in the case of a man injured in claying football bo-fore the war.     Injuries incurred on the playing fields during the war entitled a man to pension under tho pension warrants, but no so injuries incurred in this way before the war;   and the Treasury had recently refused to exer-else their pow^r under the Dispensing Warrant in a case occurring Just before the war.The Chairman replied that it was not the intention of the Committee to make any recommendation of this kind.The Committee decided:-To recommend to the Treasury that in exercising its power of makin;: grants under the Dispensing Warrant,&quot;the grants should be awarded on the new scale now decided upon (Minute 1 above) and not on the old scale.&apos;
