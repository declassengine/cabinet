(8) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Part I.-Existing Causes of Possible Trouble.It was pointed out in Part I of this Report last week that organised industrial power is a thing which cannot be abolished any more than a physical force can be abolished, but can only be dealt with by being turned in the right direction and harnessed throughthe superposition of a corresponding responsibility. It follows that if one wants to make an estimate of possible occurrences in the future one must look upon developing events from the point of view of the opportunity for the use of this power which they may be expected to afford to those who control it. The findings of Commissions, Committees, Conferences, &amp;c, as such, will carry little weight with the more advanced controllers of industrial power, since, as already suggested, they look upon them merely as so many ways of avoiding a strike.When one translates these general considerations to the region of practical facts, the organ of industrial power which stands forward at once is the Triple Alliance. This is exactly the role which its creators foresaw for it, and it is bidding fair to vindicate their foresight with extraordinary accuracy. This is not to express an opinion as to what it will accomplish, because that depends on ^outside forces. In the respect referred to accomplishment is already a fact; it has already done what it was intended to do, namely, to become the focus and machine for the use of the industrial weapon, drawing towards itself and overshadowing all other activities in the same direction, and entirely superseding any other organisation which might have had similar pretensions, such as the General Federation of Trade Unions. What one has to consider, then, if one would gauge the situation in the near future, is the number and importance of the opportunities which(c 1795)  150  a/19  h &amp; s a
forthcoming events are likely to provide to the leaders of the Triple Alliance for the develop-ment and accomplishment of the aims which they have in view. And if this be done, it must be admitted that there is considerably more cause for anxiety than a superficial glance at the state of affairs at the moment might suggest.Of these immediately possible causes of trouble the most important perhaps is the Coal Commission Report due for the 20th June. As was pointed out last week, if this does not give the miners&apos; leaders all they think their industrial power entitles them to, it is not likely that they will be content with the resulting situation, especially if other circumstances favour further action, and while in other circumstances nationalisation alone might not be a sufficient plank to obtain a solid backing for action or the serious threat of it, any additional issue of a personal nature might entirely alter the situation. Secondly, in this connection the negotiations with the railwaymen. must not be overlooked. They are reported to be proceeding satisfactorily, but in view of the somewhat uncertain situation as regards railway control in general, it is quite possible that they might develop dangerous qualities.   In any case the wage problem has only been postponed.These are issues in which the Triple Alliance are inherently directly concerned. But there are a number of others in which they are concerning themselves as a result of the industrial power wrhich they are in a position to exploit. Conscription, the Blockade, the question of Russia, the treatment of conscientious objectors and political prisoners, the income-tax limit, and finally the military circular with regard to strikes are such questions, and they are all being used together and separately to their fullest capacity. In the case of no particular one has anything of great importance happened, but together, and in an atmosphere otherwise troubled, they all could become effective : they all contain griev-ances, and some grievances with quite serious implications. The income-tax and Con-scription issues both come home to the individual in a way that, makes them of some importance. The Army circular is just the sort of thing to raise a maximum of indignation as results have shown. The questions of the Blockade and Russia are closely connected, with the question of Peace Terms and policy towards enemy countries which, of course, possesses considerable potentialities. As experience has shown, the German Government, even without action on its part, is in certain respects in a strong position as regards labour and socialist organisations in the allied countries, purporting to represent, as it takes every opportunity for saying that it does the very thing they are striving for. With the pre-sentation of the peace terms the time has come for them to take action along this line, and they appear to be doing it with some success. Another quite peculiar issue in which the Triple Alliance is reported to be concerning itself is that connected with the Police and Prison Officers&apos; Union, which, is certain to be exploited to the utmost by those who intend to make trouble.This leads finally to the consideration of other sources of trouble which are active at the present time, not connected directly with the Triple Alliance. Of these, perhaps three are worth mention. In the first place, the trouble over the Police Union has, of course, peculiar importance, especially in view of the recently reported recruiting successes of the Union, especially in Scotland, and, if, as appears to be possible, it can attract attention in industrial labour circles and provoke sympathetic action. Secondly, the movement in favour of a 44-hour week is not by any means exhausted. Following a conference representing the E. and S.T.F., the A.S.E,, and the Workers&apos; Union, a ballot is being taken as to action in this matter, and in the case of the E. and S.T.F. is reported to have resulted in a strong majority in favour of action ; while in the case of the A.S.E., at any rate, it is unlikely that the executive will be allowed to let matters rest in any event, even if they wanted to. The National Union of General Workers, the Cotton Trade Unions, and a number of smaller organisations also are moving in this matter. Here, again, is an issue with very personal implications, and one in regard to which opinion has already gained considerable momentum, which the 48-hour Bill will do little to allay and may even aggravate. Finally, there is the large and vague question of unemployment. This is so closely interwoven by action and reaction with all other issues not only industrial but also commercial, and connected not only with this country but also with others, that it is impossible to make any definite statement regarding it. But it can be said that trouble arising, or even results arising, from settlements which avoid trouble, connected with all the other issues enumerated above, cannot but have an aggravating effect on the problems connected with unemployment, and tjhat difficulties arising through these problems in turn aggravate every other difficulty which arises. There seems already little doubt that certain industrial settlements already made are having adverse commercial effects, both directly through diminution in production, and indirectly, in a vaguer and wider sphere, in the lack of confidence which they tend to foster. A movement of this kind is cumulative, and as it grows tends to invade every sphere of social activity, with
corresponding direct reactions on the industrial world that was the source of it. If the attitude and position Of controllers of industrial power outlined at the outset be now recalled, it will be seen that the situation is hardly one in which all difficulties can be considered to have been overcome. It is probably not entirely accidental that all these issues may be expected to &quot;come more or less to a head at about one and the same time not very far of!.Part II.-Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Resettlement of Disabled Men.Disabled men with whose reinstatement in civil life the Ministry of Labour has to deal, form numerically only a small part of the members of the forces for whose resettle-ment it is responsible. The number of disabled men on the registers of the Employment Exchanges on the 11th April was, in round numbers, 32,500 ; incomplete returns for the folloAving month indicate that the figure is now somewhat higher. Late in May about 11,000 more were in training. These figures are small when compared with the total number of ex-Service men in receipt of unemployment donation on the 16th May, which stood at a little over 400,000.* The importance of the problem which they present, however, can hardly be registered numerically, for the disabled may be considered to have a prior claim on the Government in the matter of resettlement.Excluding the comparatively small residuum of men who are totally unfit for any occupation, three classes of disabled men may be distinguished: (1) Men who can resume their former occupation if some adjustment of duties or processes is carried out to meet their disabilities ; (2) men who cannot resume their former occupation, but can be trained to new occupations ; and (3) men who cannot profitably be trained and are fit only for light duties.As regards the first and third of these classes, the policy so far followed has been to rely for their absorption on the ordinary course of industry, while taking special measures to bring their claims into prominence and to secure them employment. The problem was one which the Ministry had to face even before the Armistice ; but, especially as regards men fit only for light duties, the cessation of hostilities and the release of great numbers of able-bodied workers, has increased the difficulty of a task which had already proved sufficiently difficult. Special departments of the Employment Exchanges are responsible for dealing with disabled men as with other discharged members of the Forces, and in the majority of cases they are assisted in their work both by Joint Sub-Committees of the local Employment Committees and local War Pensions Committees, and by the local Employment Committees themselves. In this way, much has been done to induce employers to reinstate their former employees disabled during the war, and to find occupations for others. But, as the process of selection continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to find employment for the remainder. While in individual cases remarkable success has been attained, the general progress of resettlement remains slow. During the month ending the 11th April, the Exchanges placed in employment some 3,400 disabled men out of the 43,000 disabled with whom they had to deal. The main difficulty lies in providing the initial opportunity; once suitable occupation has been found, the disabled man generally shows himself competent. During the same month the number of disabled men for whom a second place was found was. only 132.New steps have recently been taken to urge employers to do their utmost for men of this class. Advantage has been taken of the opportunity afforded by the issue of the Prime Ministers appeal to employers on their behalf to stimulate the local Employment Committees to further activity. They have been asked to undertake, wherever possible, a personal canvass of employers in their locality, a course which had already been followed in many cases with considerable success. Thus, to quote one of the most striking examples, the Joint Sub-Committee of the Rotherham Employment Committee and the local War Pensions Committee early in February secured an arrangement by which five of the largest firms in the district reserved a percentage of their vacancies so as to absorb 20 disabled men into their works daily. Difficulties which arose with some of the trade unions were overcome successfully, and by the beginning of March 117 out of 250 disabled men registered at the beginning of February had been placed in employment, as well as 45 others registered at later dates. In ,very&apos;few cases was it necessary to find further employment for any of the men so placed.* The number of civilian men in receipt of donation on the same date was approximately 178,000. Part-time workers are excluded in both cases.(C 1795) A 2
/Part III.-Press Comments. (1) Laboiw and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.The Peace Terms.The voluminous discussion of the official draft of the proposed Treaty of Peace, which appeared in the papers reviewed last week, would seem to have been exhaustive. Taken together, the papers reviewed this week either deal with historical or personal issues, or else venture upon prophecy. The &quot; Clarion &quot; has an article in defence of France, but the other papers which last week showed approval of the Peace Terms are silent this week, except for   Justice.&quot;(a) Historical.The &quot; New Age &quot; maintains that English pacifists are in part responsible for the defects of the Treaty. By their attitude towards the war while it was still being waged, it says, they have so lost popularity that-they are powerless now for good. &quot; Justice &quot; gives an historical account of President Wilson&apos;s &quot; Fourteen Points &quot; and shows that they were by no means the basis of the Armistice.(b) Personal.Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; attacks President Wilson. Hitherto, he says, President Wilson has been given general support in the faint hope that he might secure a peace in harmony with his rhetorical? professions : but now beyond all the other Statesmen concerned, he thinks, President Wilson is discredited, and concludes that history* The Committee suggest that the employer would not be required to take on more than 4 per cent, of disabled men, and that half of these would eara full wages.While most of the committees have readily undertaken the work of canvassing, there has been a certain amount of reluctance, especially in the London and South-Eastern division. This has arisen in some cases from a belief that these voluntary committees have already as much work to do as they can carry out properly. But the view has also been taken that the problem cannot be solved fully in this way, and that State intervention is necessary to settle the question permanently and on a national basis. A proposal made by the Rotherham Employment Committee and endorsed by other committees suggests that all officers and men in receipt of disability payment should be brought within a scheme administered under the general direction of the Ministry by local Employment Committees and War Pensions Committees. An under-taking would be embodied in the &quot; fair wage &quot; clause of any contract that an agreed percentage of disabled men would be employed, in proportion to the amount of adult labour employed from time to time. Eull standard wages would be paid, the difference between the man&apos;s earnings and the standard wage being paid half by the employer and half by the State.5&quot; As announced by Mr. Wardle on the 27th May to a deputation from the National Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers, this scheme is to be submitted at an early date to the consideration of the Labour Resettlement Committee.As regards disabled men who require to be trained in other occupations, the responsibility for this work has only recently been-taken over by the Ministry of Labour from the Ministry of Pensions. The necessary readjustment of the machinery for local training is now practically complete. The Training Department has been given first claim on all National Factories for this purpose. A number of the Instructional Factories lately under the Ministry of Munitions are also being used. The number in training in technical institutions, and factories on the 21st May, was approximately 9,000. The number in training in Lord Roberts&apos;s and St. Dunstan&apos;s workshops was approximately 1,900. In all some 23,000 men of these classes have already been trained or are in training.The proposal which has often been put forward, notably by the Employment Committees and the Employment Council of the Yorkshire and East Midlands division, for the State employment of disabled men in National Factories, has not been considered practicable by the Ministry. The difficulties of management would be considerable while it would probably be almost impossible to concentrate in one centre a number of disabled men, whose objection to removing from home is, not unnaturally, very strong.
will judge him as &quot; the weakest and most incompetent person whom a malignant fate has ever entrusted with the power to interfere in human affairs.&quot; Mr. Joseph King in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer&quot; expresses the opinion that President Wilson is now an &quot; Imperialist.&quot; Mr. F. W. Jowett in the same paper says, with reference to Lord Robert Cecil, that &quot; the common people have no more deadly an enemy.&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in. &quot; Forward &quot; says that the appointment of Mr. Drummond as head of the secretariat of the League of Nations forbids him to hope that the League is intended -to be anything more than a cloak with which to hide the evil deeds of the Allied and Associated Powers. With regard to Mr. Asquith&apos;s speech at Newcastle, Mr. Philip Snowden says that it was Mr. Asquifcb&apos;s duty to have the courage to say in unmistakeable terms that the proposed Peace treaty is a base betrayal of the pledges he made on the entry of this country into the war.(c) Prophetic.Mr. E. .D. Morel in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; says there will be no security for France in the &quot; new Triple Alliance &quot; (which he regards as an infringement of President Wilson&apos;s &quot; Third Point &quot;): her only security would be in a League of all the people banded together against war itself, and against the systems and interests which have made war and will make war, unless International Labour prevent it. * The &quot; Call &quot; says that the Peace Terms will sow the seeds of hatred between nations and will provoke future wars, unless the democracies of the Western Nations come to power, and spread the spirit of international brotherhood. Dr. F. C. Conybeare in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; thinks that the terms will never be enforced, because their enforcement depends on the continued cohesion of the Allies, which, he maintains, has already begun to disappear. The &quot; New Age&quot; prophesies that the pillars of the present peace are to crumble away and bring war down upon the world once more.The Peace Conference, the Proletariat and the League of Nations.From the preceding paragraph it will be seen that the action of the proletariat is for many of these writers the only hope of the future. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in &quot; Forward &quot; goes further : for him it is the only hope of the present. He wishes that the pronounce-ment of the &quot; Committee of Action &quot;of the Permanent Commission of the International had been stronger, and that instead of deciding to approach the Peace Conference, they had made a direct appeal from the diplomats to the international proletariat. The &quot; Nation &quot; echoes this opinion. On the other hand, the more moderate of the papers recognise that the League of Nations in its working must depend upon the action of the democratic electorates which make the governments which form the League. &quot;Rob Roy&quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; stresses the fact that the League of Nations will carry on international affairs as a going concern in an evolving world, and that it is &quot; within the power of democracy to put the events of the next fifteen and thirty years from time to time at the judgment bar of the League.&quot; The &quot; Clarion &quot; quotes with approval Lord Robert Cecil as saying &quot;only the resolve of the men and women who do the ordinary work of the world can breathe into the Covenant of the League a living soul.&quot;Russia.&quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; maintains that the famine in Russia is the result of internal distrust of the Government and not of the external blockade. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; asserts that nothing but drastic industrial action can save the Russian (and German) democracies and give proof of the belief of the British Worker in international solidarity. With a reference to the recent deputation to Mr. Bonar Law from the Trade Union Congress on behalf of the Triple Alliance, it says, &quot; the time has gone by when resolutions and deputations to Ministers can serve any useful purpose.&quot;(B) Home Affairs.The Budget.With reference to Mr. Acland&apos;s motion in favour of a Capital Levy, moved on the occasion of the second reading of the Finance Bill, the &quot; New Age &quot; remarks that the time has gone by when a levy on capital would have been an adequate solution of the financial problem. The problem now, it says, is not one of capital but of credit, not one of assets but of debts, and it calls for a &quot; deflation of war debts.&quot; It strongly opposes the rumoured plan of &quot; consolidation &quot; which it says is &quot; now being hatched in the Bank of England parlour.&quot; With regard to the &quot; Preference Duties^&quot; the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; asserts that there is class hostility in every dominion, and maintains that a &quot; dole of money to the already rich &quot; is not the proper way to meet this situation.(C 1795^ &apos; A 3
Conscription.Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; refers to the so-called &quot; Daily Herald &quot; disclosures of confidential Army documents, and maintains that they prove his contention that it is impossible to separate military and industrial conscription. The Merthyr Tydfil &quot; Pioneer &quot; reports a meeting held under the auspices of the National Council for Civil Liberties at Cardiff on 17th May at which Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, M.P.- complained of the fact that the Trade Union Congress has not yet determined to call a special conference of the organised workers to deal with the conscription question. In a leading article the same paper suggests that an ultimatum must be presented at Westminster, the terms of which would be : &quot; Withdraw conscription or else on a specified date the wheels of industry shall cease to run.&quot;Parliamentary Bills.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; welcomes the end of the long controversy re the &quot; Restoration of Pre-War Practices Bill,&quot; and hopes that the Trade Unions will provide for the har-monious co-operation of skilled and unskilled workmen on terms mutually advantageous. With regard to the proposed &quot; Forty-Eight Hour Bill,&quot; it says it will be necessary to scrutinise carefully any proposals for variations or exemptions, and hopes that this Bill will speedily be followed by a &quot; Minimum Wage Bill.&quot;Local Government.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; emphasises the fact that the conference the Fabian Society recently held on &quot; Local Government &quot; repudiated the machinery of co-option as a means of securing the representation of working-class men and women on local committees.Coal Mines Commission.The &quot; New Age &quot; thinks that technical questions are irrelevant to the Inquiry. It draws from the public attitude towards the examination of the &quot; Dukes &quot; the moral that, while the English publio may wish to know what the miners want, it will be much more sympathetic when it knows what they mean to have.National Shipyards.The &quot; New Age,&quot; the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; Clarion &quot; agree in describing the Governments offer of the Chepstow and Bleachley Shipyards to the National Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions as a &quot; trap &quot; or a &quot; bait.&quot; They all approve of the Federation^ decision. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; thinks the Government^ terms were &quot; onerous.&quot;Peace Celebrations.Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; hopes that no trade union or trades council will take part in any official celebration of the Peace. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; adopts the same opinion, but the &quot; British Citizen &quot; takes up an entirely opposite position.Parliamentary Labour Party.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; approves of the decision of the Manchester Labour Party not to enter into any arrangement with the Manchester Liberal Federation with regard to an allocation of local seats between the two parties in any forthcoming election. Mr-Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; refers to the &quot; abject performance &quot; of the Labour Party in the Irish debate on the 14th May, and remarks upon their neglect of the Foreign Office debate on the 15th May; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; comments adversely on the fact that only twenty Labour members took part in the division on the 16th May on the Labour.Party&apos;s own &quot;Local Authorities (Enabling) Bill.&quot;The Triple Alliance and Politics.The &quot; Call&quot; complains of the delays of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress in its representations to the Government, in conjunction with the Triple Alliance, which have resulted from the so-called Southport resolutions. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; calls upon the Triple Alliance to act on its own initiative. Mr. Robert Blatchford in the &quot; Clarion &quot; stresses the essential difference between a strike where employees only are concerned and a strike against the State. This last he maintains is of the nature of a rebellion, and the Government is justified in such a case in the use of
Army, Navy and Police.. He says there is an &quot; unspoken contract&quot; that the miners or similar Trade Unions should not make political capital out of the public dependence on their loyalty, and he is confident that if the Government shows a firm front and speaks out frankly, it will have the British public behind it in any controversy about the so-called &quot; Secret instructions&quot; which the &quot;&apos; Daily Herald&quot; published on the 13th May.(2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Women in the Civil Service. The &quot; Daily Mail&quot; (26th May), commenting upon the report of Viscount Gladstone^ Committee on Women in the Civil Service, says that the public is more interested in demobilising than recruiting swollen Government Departments. The opinion is also expressed that, though women are to have extended opportunities of employment and promotion, the barrier between the lower and upper grade is left standing, if shaken. Only here and there is a scaling ladder suggested which merit may mount.Part IV. General Topics and District Reports.(1) General.Coal Commission.  -Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson (Financial Adviser to the Coal Controller) has been added to the list of officials assisting the Commission. The Commission held sittings on the 22nd, 23rd, and 27th and 28th May, and heard evidence from the following employers, managers, and technical experts in the coal-mining and allied industries : Messrs. E. P. Rhodes (Mining Association of Great Britain), H. Bramwell (Great Western Colliery Company), Col. Sir F. Beauchamp, Mr. A. 0. Hughes (Head Surveyor, Powell Dyfferyn Collery (Mr. J. Gibson (Scottish Colliery Manager), Mr. W. Blane (Scottish Mining Engineer). H. W. Slesser (Standing Counsel to the Miners&apos; Federation) submitted a draft Bill for the nationalisation of mines and minerals, on which&quot; Mr. W. Straker (Secretary of the Northumberland Miners&apos; Association) also gave evidence. Capt. W. S. Saunders (Secretary of the Fabian Society) gave evidence on the working of State Mines in Germany.Resolutions against the nationalisation of the coal mines have been passed at various public meetings, including a meeting of household and industrial coal consumers at Newcastle, a meeting of manufacturers engaged in industries on the banks of the Thames and tributary waterways, and a meeting at Nottingham of the Midland Counties Institution of Mining Engineers.The monthly circular of the Durham Miners&apos; Association pays a high tribute to the thoroughness of the work of the Commission and the impartiality of the Chairman. It expresses the opinion that the &quot; searching examination &quot; of the Dukes may result in a step forward towards the breaking down of class distinctions and the improvement of the conditions of the working classes in general.Industrial Conference.The Trade Union side of the National Industrial Conference met on the 22nd May to* consider the Prime Ministers proposals for carrying into effect the recommendations of the Provisional Joint Committee.Shipbuilding.A ballot of members of the National Union of General Workers engaged in the shipbuilding, engineering and allied trades on the question of a 44-hour week resulted in over 24,000 in favour and none against. It is probable, however, that this peculiar result arises, as it has done before, from the wording of the ballot papers, which may have amounted to the query as to whether the men want less work, other things being equal.. The policy of a 44-hour week has also been endorsed by an overwhelming majority by the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trade Unions. It is reported that there is a growing, demand for a 44-hour week on the North-East Coast.(C 1795)
Income-Tax.The Executive of the Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales Enginemen&apos;s and Boilermen&apos;s Federation have passed a resolution demanding that the Income-Tax abate-ment should he raised to  250, and suggesting that a joint national conference of Trade Unions should be called with the purpose of devising common measures for the refusal of payment of the present basis. Similar resolutions were passed by the Council for the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association at Chesterfield on the 24th May, and by a meeting of the National Society of Brushmakers at Blackpool.Woolcombers.The National Society of Woolcombers has been holding a &quot;ballot on the question of setting a fund aside for purposes of political action. It resulted in a large majority in favour. It is stated, however, that for the present the fund is likely to be devoted to municipal and not Parliamentary purposes.The Officials of the Woolcombing Operatives&apos; Union have made a demand for a further weekly wage advance of 8s. for men and 5s. Qd. for women. .Engineers.A three days&apos; conference has been held at York between the A.S.E. and kindred unions, and the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation. Its primary object was to discuss the question of night work wages. The employers offer to night-shifts a 47-hour week, to be paid for at time and a quarter rates, with no pay for meal hours. The Unions want a higher rate of pay. The conference also considered the possibility of arranging general working conditions for the engineering trades on a national basis, instead of having merely district and local conditions. Its deliberations have been adjourned till the 18th June.Conscription, dc.The Military Service Act, and the secret Army circular published by the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; have been condemned in resolutions by various organisations during the week, including the Annual Conference of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen at Leeds, a demonstration of local Trade Union and Labour. organisations at Newcastle, the Council of the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association and of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, the National Society of Brushmakers, the Bristol and South-West District Council of the N.U.R.The Executive Committee of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners has passed a resolution &quot; strongly recommending &quot; its members &quot; not to work on ships being fitted for conveying troops and munitions to Russia.&quot; It is also &quot; seeking the assistance of other Unions connected with shipbuilding with a vew to direct action.&quot;The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congree met on the 28th May to consider the reply of Mr. Bonar Law to the representations made to him on the subject of the Southport Resolutions by the deputation on the 21st May. The Committee decided that Mr. Bonar- Law&apos;s replies were sufficiently satisfactory to justify them in not acceding to the suggestion of the Triple Alliance that a special conference should be called.The Executive Committee of the National Union of Railwaymen have, however, passed a resolution criticising the Parliamentary Committee&apos;s attitude, and appealing to the Triple Alliance to summon a National Conference.Cinema Operators.The Electrical Trade Union is organising the cinema operators both in London and in the provinces, who are pressing forward a programme which includes : (a) Uniform wages and conditions; (6) a scheme for apprenticeship ; (c) employment exchanges for operators. Arrangements have been made to invite cinema owners and film renters to a joint conference to discuss these points, and a large number of them are stated to view the idea with favour.  ,Police.A number of demonstrations have been held during the week both in London and the provinces by the National Union of Police and Prison Officers. They are demanding :  (a) The recognition of the Union ; (b) the reinstatement of ex-P.C. Spackman ; (c) increase of pay and pensions ; (d) removal of all kinds of military control in the service. A ballot is at present in progress on the question of striking, if necessary, for the attainment of these objects. The Triple Alliance is also stated to be taking a vote of its members on the question of &quot; sympathetic action &quot; to secure the recognition of the Union.
&apos;V Restoration &quot; Bill.A Bill for the Restoration of Pre-War Trade Union Practices was introduced in the House of Commons by the Minister of Labour on the 26th May. This is the third measure that has been prepared on the subject, and is the result of protracted negotiations with the Trade Union Restoration Committee. One objection of the Unions has beep removed by the abandonment of the provision placing upon individual Unions the onus of giving notice for the restoration of their, own pre-war customs. It*is now provided that the obligation for the restoration of pre-war practices rests with the employer; the obligation becomes, i/pso facto,, operative on the passing of the Bill, and the practices must be restored within two months of this date, otherwise the employer is liable to prosecution. Another provision secures that only Unions, and not individual workmen, pan contract out.Motel Staffs, &amp;c. . -At a meeting of hotel, club and restaurant workers held on the 22nd May, a resolution was passed demanding inclusion in the terms of the forthcoming Eight-Hour Bill.-Agriculture.The Federation of Country Agricultural Executive Committees met on the 22nd May and passed a resolution deploring the &quot; disastrous &quot; effects of proceeding with the with-drawal of soldier labour from agriculture. Members of the Yorkshire Agricultural Union have pledged themselves in writing to refuse to pay increased wages or grant shorter hours to their labourers.The National Agricultural and Rural Workers&apos; Union has brought out a new journal, &quot; The Land Worker.&quot;National Factories. C ;A demonstration, organised by the Waddon Shop Stewards&apos; Committee, was held in Hyde Park on the 22nd May to protest against the discharge of workers from the Waddon National Factory and Salvage Depot (near Croydon).Railwaymen.The Annual Conference of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen met at Leeds this week and passed resolutions condemning Conscription, the Blockade, and the confidential inquiry about trade unionism in the Army. Demands were also made for shorter working hours (with a threat of a national stoppage if this was not complied with), and for the direct representation of the Society on any Depart-ment set up to deal with railways. A resolution was passed that in any future war the representatives of Labour should not support the Government till the rank and file have been consulted, and the matter has been discussed with Labour leaders in &quot; supposed enemy countries.&quot;New Trade Unions.A National Union of Scientific Workers has been formed, and steps have been taken towards the registration as a Trade Union of the Clerical Staffs Guild, which has lately increased its membership by the recruitment of some 2,000 shipping clerks.Amalgamations.The various Trade Unions affiliated to the National Federation of General Workers are moving towards amalgamation, Eleven unions are concerned, with a membership of nearly a million and a quarter.A ballot has been taken by members of the Postmen&apos;s Federation and the Postal and Telegraph Clerks&apos;&apos; Association on the question of amalgamation, and there is a further project for the amalgamation of these two unions with the Fawcett Association.The Emergency Committee of the National Building Trades&apos; Federation met on the 26th May to discuss the proposed amalgamation of the four unions included in the Federation. A Committee has been appointed to draw up a scheme, and will meet on the 6th June.The Executive of the Plumbers&apos; and Coppersmiths&apos; Societies have accepted the principle of fusion, and are submitting the question to the rank and file for consideration. It is stated that the plumbers are favourable to immediate amalgamation, but the copper-smiths think a period of federation necessary.
A scheme for joint action has been arranged between the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the London and Provincial Union of Licensed Vehicle Workers.A scheme of amalgamation has been agreed upon between the Executive of the Amalgamated Association of Tramway and Vehicle Workers and of the Amalgamated Garters, Lurrymen&apos;s and Motormerts Union, and a ballot of members is to-be taken.. Similar negotiations are afoot between the three main unions engaged in the Pottery trade, delegates from which have unanimously approved an amalgamation scheme, and between the fourteen Unions engaged in the Shipbuilding and Engineering trade.Vehicle Workers.The Amalgamated Association of Tramway and Vehicle Workers continued its-delegate meetings at Cardiff on the 22nd and 23rd May. A resolution was passed against the continued employment of women in the trade, especially those whose husbands are-in employment.Ex-Service Men.A deputation from the Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors had an interview with Mr. Gr. J. Wardle, M.P. (Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour), on the 26th May, on the subject of unemployment among ex-service men. Sub-sequently the following resolution was passed by a mass meeting in Hyde Park : &quot; This Mass Meeting of unemployed ex-service men deeply regrets that the replies of the Minister of Labour to the deputation are unsatisfactory, and demands that the unemployed ex-service men shall immediately be found work at Trade Union rates. Failing this it demands that ex-service men shall receive unemployment donation at 29s. per week, increased to  2 where there are children.&quot;From Hyde Park the demonstrators marched to Buckingham Palace and the House of Commons. Spontaneous rioting took place. The demonstrators dispersed on Mr. Hogge&apos;s assurance that their grievances would be brought before the House. This was done on the following day.Trade Boards.Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving T.B. (Great Britain).(a) The Trade Board have adopted the recommendations of the Special Committee with regard to the wages to be paid to women engaged on men&apos;s work, and have agreed: to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix for these classes of female workers the general minimum, time-rates now applicable to male workers.(b) The Board have fixed overtime rates as contained in their notice of proposal dated: 3rd March, which have been sent to the Minister for confirmation.-Joint Industrial Councils.Government Industrial.Representatives of the Ministry of Labour have held conferences with represen-tatives of the Office of Works (19th May) and of the War Office (22nd May) to consider the application of the Whitley scheme to the employees of the two Departments named.Furniture.The 15th meeting of the Council was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 22nd May. The position of the Conciliation Board was discussed, and the employers-agreed to table a resolution in favour of a 47-hour week for discussion at the next meeting of the Council. The application for an increase in wages of 2d. per hour by the London French Polishers has been granted (out of court) by the employers, although the Conciliation Board failed to effect an agreement.Pottery.The Executive Committee metv at Stoke-on-Trent on the 19th May, and heard an application for representation from the Association of Managers and Officials. The application was agreed to in principle, but the question as to the side on which the representatives are to sit is unsettled, the Association insisting on an independent-position, and the Trade Union side opposing the suggestion of cross-benches.
(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Unemployment. There is a stready decrease of unemployment in such metropolitan areas as Bermondsey, Shepherd&apos;s Bush, Poplar, and Tottenham. The revival of building operations is general, and road improvements, sewerage and drainage schemes and extensions of electric power supply have been started by several London boroughs, which are expected to employ from 1,700 to 2,500 hands. The Employment Council are pressing on the Middlesex County Council the construction of the Great Western Road. The Poplar Employment Committee have raised the question whether unemployment dona-tion should, be paid to aliens discharged from the British forces.At Woolwich the All Grades Committee formed to secure alternative work for the Arsenal and the Dockyard has linked up with the Woolwich Chamber of Commerce, the Local Employment Committee and the Borough Council. The agitation to keep open Waltham Abbey Powder Factory still continues.General. In East London the Workers&apos; Committee seems bent on influencing the Dockers&apos; Union to refuse to handle work on ships for Russia. Most other recent labour activities have had more than a local significance, and it is difficult to estimate how far they reflect London conditions.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. No serious increase is anticipated in this area, and decreases are notable at Cambridge, Leicester, and Loughborough. Letchworth has a fairly high ra*te of unemployment. The staff handling the fish traffic at Great Yarmouth is inadequate, and it is proposed to train women for the work.South-Western.Unemployment. A general decrease in unemployment is reported, especially at Gloucester and Bristol, where the building trade is reviving. The situation at Portsmouth and Plymouth is easier, although the Workers&apos; Union is apprehensive, and in a demon-stration held on the 11th May asked the Admiralty to cease discharging men and to employ the plant for building merchant ships. At Bath, Swindon and Cheltenham, local difficulties continue to hamper resettlement.West Midlands.Unemployment. A decrease of unemployment is reported generally, and progress towards resettlement is steady except in industries dependent on large supplies of iron and steel. The Smethwick area alone shows increased unemployment figures. Shortage of bar-iron is a more potent factor in producing slackness at Cradley Beath than either the price of coal or the.limited number of puddlers available. Firebrick-making at Stourbridge is affected by the shortage of railway wagons. Lock-making is reported to be suffering from American and Japanese competition, and the Employment Council suggests the reimposition of import restrictions on locks and awl blades. At Stafford an inadequate allocation of fine upper leather is reacting on boot and shoe manufacturing. The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives has protested against the employ-ment of enemy alien labour on constructional work at Shrewsbury. The six weeks&apos; agricultural training scheme for ex-Service men is criticised in such an agricultural area as Hereford as a waste of time and money ; the placing of the men on selected farms with a subsidy to the farmer for a limited period is put forward as an alternative sugges-tion.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. Unemployment, while still serious in some towns of the West Riding, seems to have been checked, and the situation at Sheffield is steadily improving.Building schemes are retarded by a shortage of bricklayers, particularly at Sheffield and Scunthorpe. There is a persistent demand that moulders should be released from the Army without regard to age or service, as the shortage of this class of labour will become more pronounced if the unions continue to object to overtime work.General. There is sporadic unrest among the Notts miners over the definition of an &quot; abnormal place.&quot; Municipal workers are also unsettled. Ripon was without gas ior a week, and a strike of clerks in the gasworks at Chesterfield was averted with
difficulty by the Ministry. Farmers are indignant at the extra 6s. Qd. weekly wage to be paid under the recent wages award; a meeting of -the Yorkshire Agricultural Union decided to refuse payment, and threatened to withdraw the milk supply by way of a reprisal.The Long Eaton Employment Committee suggests that trade panels be instituted in connection with local Employment Committees to help in the settlement of minor trade disputes.North-Western.Unemployment. The unemployment figures for this division are falling, especially at Accrington, Bolton, Burnley, Manchester and Preston. While much of the decrease in the figures for the area is to be attributed to the exclusion of part-time workers from the live register, there is evidence that, as in other divisions, some real decrease can be recorded. In representative centres the trade outlook is regarded as improving. Preston expects to resume normal working hours in its cotton mills in a few weeks, and the turn-over to peace production in the local engineering firms is now complete. At Hyde a decided improvement is reported in cotton and engineering, and hat-making is booming. The Macclesfield silk industry is improving, and in Rossendale, cotton, shoemaking,. bleaching and dyeing are either fair or slightly better.General. Factors retarding resettlement are the retention of men in the Army who have been discovered to be pivotal since the 31st January, the difficulty of transport, and; in St. Helens particularly, a shortage of coal supplies. In the wagon-making and repairing centres, Ince, Wigan and Chorley, insufficient labour, increased costings and apprehension as to the policy of the Ministry of Ways and Communications are the reasons alleged as affecting output.The Mersey dockers and the cabinet-makers and wood-cutting machinists in the same area are very restless. The Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation discussed the position of the wood-cutting machinists at a recent meeting, but more interest was aroused by demands that allowances for dirty and unpleasant work should continue to be exempt from income-tax, and that the 44-hour week should be established and bonuses merged in a standard rate. The result of the ballot on hours and wages in the cotton trade will be announced on the 28th May ; indications point to a heavy majority against the employers&apos; offer and in favour of a 46^-hour week and an increase of 30 per cent., on wages.Northern.. Unemployment. Unemployment shows a decrease in the seriously affected areas of Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Darlington and the Hartlepools. Building is absorbing labour at Newcastle and Middlesbrough, ,and shipbuilding at Newcastle, Sunderland and especially in the Hartlepools. Engineering is fairly brisk and the operation of the 8-hour day in the iron and steel works at Workington seems to have absorbed the local surplus. As in other divisions, the shortage of wagons is a cause of industrial dislocation and has led to the closing down of the Cargo Fleet Iron Company&apos;s. works at South Bank. The strain on the railways, it is reported, is further increased by their having to handle goods which were previously sent by sea, but have been diverted by high freights and are being despatched by land carriage. Newcastle is experiencing, difficulty in resettling disabled soldiers who are unskilled.General. The agitation for the 44-hour week continues. The boilermakers in the Tyne, Tees and Wear shipyards are refusing to work overtime until a satisfactory week is. attained; the bricklayers and bricklayers&apos; labourers in steel and iron works are still demanding similar concessions on the ground that shorter hours will mean increased employment. Politically, the Peace Treaty has been denounced by prominent labour-politicians among the miners as likely to lead to new wars.Wales.Unemployment. There is a general decrease of unemployment, except at Swansea,, where a temporary increase has been caused by the recent strike of annealers. It is hoped that unemployment has passed its high-water mark. Decreases are reported from Flint, where galvanising works have restarted^ and from Wrexham, where the miners have returned to work.  In South Wales a full resumption at Ebbw Vale is not expected
till Whitsnn, but the resumption of work by the Swansea general cargo workers, the copper workers and the labourers at Port Talbot will ease the situation. In North Wales, outside the coal areas of the Marches, a brisk demand for labour is anticipated with the reopening of the quarries.General. The most general factor retarding resettlement is the transport difficulty. The output of South Wales is largely heavy raw material coal, steel, tinplate, stone and crushed granite for metalling roads and it is complained that the railway companies prefer to allocate trucks to carry better-paying types of merchandise. Hence, in spite of a strong demand for iron, restricted supplies of gas coal and iron ore are checking expansion. The spelter industry, in particular, is reported to be working from day to day on meagre coal supplies in face of brisk American competition.The agitation in South Wales against the Russian policy of the Government continues, and fresh demands in the agitators&apos; programme are a revision of income-tax regulations and a commission to inquire into the cost of living. Since the issue of the Sankey report, the prices of such goods as boots and clothes have risen suddenly in the mining valleys.Scotland.Unemployment. Unemployment seems to have become stationary, but is still serious in the large towns, Kilmarnock mills are being forced to adopt short-time working, and an increase of unemployment is reported from Inverness and Greenock. On the other hand, the adoption of the eight-hour day in the Wishaw steel works has created a demand for labour, and the new industrial area of the upper Forth basin is preparing for further expansion ; the situation in Dunfermline is improving ; a better tone is reported in the Dundee jute industry ; developments on a large scale are anticipated in shipbuilding at Alloa, and the Stirlingshire County Council is supporting a proposal to bridge the Forth and link up Alloa with the new East Stirlingshire coal-field. - Falkirk, where unemploy-ment among women is a difficult problem, is considering the starting of new industries such as hosiery making.The Highlands Reconstruction Committee is agitating for an imperial loan of  2,000,000 to settle 16,000 small holdings, and has secured the support of the Employment Council in a protest against the allocation of  15,000 as inadequate. A sudden local unemployment problem has been caused by the destruction of Messrs. P. &amp; P. CampbelTs dyeworks by fire, which will throw out of employment about 500 workers in Perth.General. The agitation to secure the release of the Glasgow strikers is still being carried on, but with waning enthusiasm. The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee has been discussing a general strike to protest against the operations in Russia. It is reported that the Glasgow unit of the Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers has changed its name to the &quot; International Union of Ex-Service Men,&quot; and that it proposes affiliation with similar bodies in Canada, Australia and various European countries. Its medium of propaganda is to be a paper entitled the &quot; New World.&quot;Part Y. Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.About 2,000 Perth dye-workers struck on the 23rd May for an increase of 5s. per week for men, 4s. for women and Is. for workers under 18 years.The strike of miners at the Varteg Colliery, South Wales, has ended ; the last of the head hauliers has transferred from the Master Hauliers&apos; Association to the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.There was a strike of about 1,400 meh at the Bed was Navigation Colliery, South Wales, on the 26th May.

Representatives&apos; of the men are to descend the pit on the 28th May to test the conveyer.The strike of woodworkers at several London firms against the premium bonus system continues. The carpenters and joiners at the Basingstoke and Southampton works of John Thornycroft have lately joined the strikers.
(6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The result of the ballot of cotton operatives on the question of shorter hours has not yet been officially announced, but it is reported that the necessary majority has been obtained against accepting the employers&apos; offer of a 48-hour week with 15 per cent, advance on piece wages.  Unless the employers amend their offer strike notices may be tendered early in June.The threatened strike of the Forest of Dean colliers on a minimum wage disagreement has been averted, the Coal Controller having effected a compromise.The farmers of the South-West Counties continue to express their dissatisfaction at the refusal of the Food Controller to alter the summer price for milk. A representative meeting of farmers at Exeter on 23rd May passed a resolution re-affirming their demand for the removal of the unjust differentiation in prices, and warning the Food Controller that, unless this demand is granted before 15th June, &quot;practical measures will be taken to obtain justice.&quot; The Executive Committee of the Lancashire Farmers&apos; Association passed a resolution recommending the retailers of the Preston district to accept the Qd. per quart fixed by the Divisional Commission for June only, and asking the Food Commission to receive a deputation from the producers and retailers of the Preston district before fixing the price for the subsequent months.The members of the Yorkshire Agricultural Union have pledged themselves by written document not to pay increased wages or grant shorter hours/the Union to support any members who may be penalised. At a meeting on 22nd May they passed a resolution strongly protesting against the recent decision of the Wages Board.The Liverpool dockers by a large majority, have rejected the three alternative offers made by the employers with regard to night work. However, they are continuing to work overtime up to 7 o&apos;clock according to the terms of the dockers&apos; national charter. The charter leaves overtime conditions beyond that hour to be settled locally, and at Liverpool no agreement has yet been reached as to what shall constitute the first half night.The Burnley branch of the A.S.E. is demanding the removal of women from the local engineering works.Some unrest is reported among the members of the A.S.E., including fitters, turners, blacksmiths and coppersmiths in the Cardiff district because of the employers&apos; refusal to concede their demands for an eight-hour day instead of the eight and a half hours worked at present.&apos; The men have decided to cease all overtime as a protest.The Carpenters&apos; and Joiners&apos; Society at Ramsgate has refused to allow a discharged and disabled soldier to be trained as a wood machinist and joiner by a local firm. The man was sent to the town by the Ministry of Pensions.The colliery workers in the Western Valley of Monmouthshire put in a claim for increased payment for week-end work; the Ministry of&apos; Labour, however, considers that the question should be settled nationally. The men have decided to remain at work for one month longer in the hope of a settlement being reached. *The Master Bakers&apos; Federation has given notice to terminate the existing national working agreement on 18th June. For the new agreement, the Operatives&apos; Union is expected to put forward a demand for a 70s. minimum wage, a 44-hour week and limitation of overtime.The West End of London members of the Garment Workers&apos; Union struck work on the 27th May &quot; until such time as the employers grant their demands.&quot; These demands include 100 per cent, advance on pre-war wages,  3 a week minimum for skilled tailoresses, abolition of the middleman and proper workshop accommodation.300 waste paper sorters, members of the Dockers&apos; Union, struck work on the 27th May at three Thames wharves.
