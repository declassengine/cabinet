/milk 10.This dcvuimcrrt is his combat&amp;nnlojfljteg181milk control.memorandum by food controller.1 circulate, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, a Memorandum on the permanent control of the Milk Trade.The essence of the proposals contained in this Memorandum is that the State, through a Milk Control Board, should take over all the wholesale milk businesses and through their means guarantee to producers a market for milk at adequate prices. I am of opinion that no measure short of this will ensure the realisation of the five main objects which I regard as essential, namely, the increase in the quantity of milk consumed, the improvement of its quality, the safeguarding of producers and consumers alike against the domination of Trusts, the prevention of waste in distribution, and the equitable sharing of supplies in times of shortage.It will not be necessary for the State, having taken over the wholesale milk businesses, to retain them all in its own hands; indeed, the scheme contemplates that, so far as possible, these businesses shall be transferred either to co-operative producers&apos; organisations or to local milk authorities established by municipalities. They will, however, in all cases work under regulations of the Central Milk Board, and will be required to fulfil its conditions in respect of guaranteeing a price and a market to the producers. Parliamentary responsibility for tho administration of my proposals, if adopted, must, of course, be taken by some permanent Minister. In my view, this should be the Minister of Health (possibly with the assistance of a special Parliamentary Secretary).The proposals set forth in the Memorandum have been discussed both with the Depart-ments directly concerned and with the representatives o-f agriculture. Among the latter there is a sharp cleavage of opinion. The Central Agricultural Advisory Council with whom the scheme has been discussed were on the whole strongly opposed to the proposals in so far as they involved fixing of prices by a Government Department and permanent control over or purchase of the wholesale trade. On the other hand, the Associated Milk Producers5 Council have submitted to me and to the President of the Board of Agriculture a scheme of control which, in most of its main principles, is practically the same as that here put forward; a copy of this scheme is given in an Appendix. The Central Agricultural Advisory Council represents the general body of farmers, including many who have little or no interest in milk production. The Associated Milk Producers&apos; Council represents more direct and concentrated experience of the particular problem under consideration.The London and Provincial Master Dairymen&apos;s Association have also expressed themselves as in favour of control.The Consumers&apos; Council have repeatedly passed resolutions in favour of control involving the taking over of the wholesale trade.I may refer also to a report recently presented by the Food Control Committee of Sheffield urging that general powers should be given to municipalities to take over or control retail distribution of milk within their districts.I submit the matter, accordingly, to the War Cabinet, with a view to obtaining an early fj^cision(a) as to whether the necessary legislation to give effect to these proposals should be prepared and introduced; :(&amp;) as to which Department should take the responsibility for action.(23127.)   Wt.-G 1132.   150.  5/111.   D &amp; S.   G. 2.
I should add that I fixed milk prices for the summer months, i.e., to the end of September^ I have revoked the Order under which I took possession of wholesale milk businesses in last October, as it seemed impossible, on the basis of this Order, to make a satisfactory financial arrangement with the businesses taken over; but I have retained power to control the setting-up of new depots and wholesale businesses.There is, moreover, a risk of short supply of milk next winter, and it may be necessary in the interests of consumers to fix prices and control distribution until next spring, even if full control is not established as a permanent measure. The responsibility for doing this should be vested in some permanent Government Department, and the necessary powers should be conferred upon it. It will thus be necessary in any event to have some additional legislation as to milk during the present year. This legislation would most conveniently be introduced by way of amendment to the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915. Under that Act, which has not yet come into operation, power is given to the Local Government Board to make Regulations on a number of matters connected with milk, with a view to securing that it shall be produced and handled under more satisfactory conditions than have hitherto prevailed.On enquiry at the Local Government Board I was informed that that Department had come independently to the conclusion, in view of the experience of the War, that the Act requires to be strengthened. The additional powers which I consider necessary as a minimum, and which I understand would also meet the views of the Local Government Board, are as follows : (a) To license all dealers in milk.   (This is already provided for in the Scottish but notin the English Act.)(b) To grade and define milk according to the way it has been produced or treated. (Thisis partly covered by the existing Act, but wider powers are needed.).  (c) To empower local authorities to undertake the supply of milk within their areas.(d) To fix maximum prices in case of need.(e) To regulate distribution in times of short supply.(/) To control the use of milk for the manufacture of milk products.Ministry of Food,May 27th, 1919.G. H. ROBERTS.
-MEMORANDUM ON THE PERMANENT CONTROL OF THE MILK TRADE.I.   General.1. During the period of the War the Food Controller, acting under the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Act, has exercised a very substantial control over the production and distribution of milk. He has fixed maximum prices, licensed dealers, issued special licences for graded milk, directed distribution throughout the trade, controlled the institution of new depots and factories, regulated and restricted the manufacture of milk products and the use of milk in manufacture, imposed restrictions on consumption during periods when supplies were short, and has set up the administrative machinery necessary for all these purposes. In this work effective co-operation with the Boards of Agriculture and the Local Government Board has been assured, with the result that the difficulties of the war period have been successfully met.2. With the return of peace conditions the problem of the future of the milk trade has to be faced. It is clear that this question should not be dealt with by a Ministry created for war purposes and acting under sanctions of an admittedly temporary nature. If it is decided by the Government that a permanent control over the conditions of production and distribution of milk (involving possibly some degree of nationalisation and municipalisation of the trade) is desirable, a statutory basis for such control must be provided; and the work of administration must be ultimately entrusted to some permanent Government Department.3. To justify such an important decision, serious defects in the existing system of milk production and distribution which are not merely the result of war conditions and which cannot be cured by existing methods of inspection must be shown to exist,4. The conditions under which milk is produced and distributed in Great Britain have been the subject of exhaustive examination by Government Departments, Municipal Authorities, and private organisations. Reference may be made, in particular, to the reports of the Aster Committee which have been presented to Parliament and to a Memorandum recently drawn up by the Milk Control Board of the Ministry of Food. There can be no doubt as to the unsatis-factory character of the milk supply at present.5. As a result, it is urged that there are good grounds for introducing a permanent and extensive system of milk control, involving the taking over of all wholesale milk businesses and the guarantee to the farmers of a price and a market for their milk. An outline of a scheme for this purpose is given in Part II. of this Memorandum. The objects to be achieved are set out in Part III.II.  Outline of Scheme of Milk Control.6. A Central Milk Board will be appointed by the Government, responsible to Parliament through the Food Controller or on the termination of his office through the competent Minister to be nominated by Order in Council. The Milk Board will deal with the whole of Great Britain, with the statutory sub-committees for England, Scotland, and possibly Wales. The inclusion of Ireland is not essential and might be left for further consideration.7. The Board will be empowered to purchase compulsorily at a price to be fixed by arbitra-tion, in default of agreement, any milk business other than one conducted by a licensed milk producers5 association, and either to carry on the business itself or to transfer it to a Local Milk Authority. It is contemplated that as a general rule no person should -be allowed to carry on a wholesale business in milk except: (a) The Central Milk Board or a Local Milk Authority acting through a business whichhas thus been purchased;(b) A licensed&apos; association of milk producers whose dealings would be subject to theregulations of the Milk Board.It is not contemplated that the Milk Board should, as a rule, purchase retail businesses, but it must have power to do so in order to deal with cases where a retail business is carried on in combination with a wholesale business.8. The Milk Board will be empowered to transfer to a licensed producers5 association any wholesale business; and, conversely, to acquire by agreement any business of a.producers&apos; allociation.9. The Milk Board will from time to time announce in advance the guaranteed price of milk which it will undertake to pay for all milk offered to any wholesale business purchased by it, subject to reasonable notice being given of substantial increases in supply. There will probably be prices for three distinct grades of milk and the prices&apos; may vary from one part of the country to another.  Producers will be free to sell milk elsewhere (e.g., direct to retailers or to
consumers or through their own Associations) subject to any necessary regulations relating to distribution and to maximum retail prices for milk prescribed either by the Milk Board or by the Local Milk Authority. (See paragraph 14 below.)10. All questions of the establishment of new producers&apos; associations or the erection of new depots will, be the subject of regulation by the Central Milk Board.11. For the purpose of the guaranteed wholesale price and also of maximum retail prices, the Milk Board will be empowered to establish grades of milk according to certain tests of quality and purity.12. The Milk Board will distribute the wholesale milk purchased by it according to requirements, probably at a flat price according to quality to retailers or municipal authorities in all districts requiring it. &apos; -13. The Milk Board will fix general maximum retail prices for milk of various grades. The Local Milk Authority will have power with the consent of the Board to fix special retail prices for its own area.14. A Local Milk Authority may be established in each county borough, borough and urban district, with a population of more than 20,000. This Authority will be empowered, among other things: (a) Itself to undertake retail distribution of milk within its area, purchasing under com-pulsory powers existing retail businesses if necessary to that end or taking them by transfer from the Milk Board; or alternatively to set up a special authority for this purpose.(b) To regulate retail distribution by the trade where this is still left to the trade.(c) To fix retail prices.(d) To supply milk below cost to children below the age of five.(e) To take over any wholesale business within the area which is substantially confined todistributing milk within that area. Such wholesale businesses would probably be purchased by the Central Milk Board in the first instance under its general scheme of purchase, and then transferred to the appropriate authority.All these powers will be exercised under the supervision of the Milk Board, whose specific consent will be required in a number of cases.15. In the case of Greater London, special statutory provision will be made for the con-stitution, powders and duties of the Local Milk Authority. &apos; There will also be a general provision for combining contiguous municipal districts for the purpose of constituting a single authority.16. The general policy of the Milk Board will be to encourage the formation of producers&apos; associations with a view (i) to handing over to them wholesale businesses purchased by it; (ii) to enlisting the co-operation of the farmers themselves in improving the quality of the milk supply.III.  Objects of Proposed Scheme.17. To secure an increased quantity of milk It is generally agreed that the present supply of milk is inadequate in the winter period, and medical authorities hold that, in particular, the consumption by young children could be increased with very great advantage to the health of the community. If all children up to the age of six are to have the allowance prescribed in the Ministry^ Priority Scheme (which is well below what many medical authorities recommend) more than two-thirds of the winter supply is absorbed leaving only about a- tenth of a pint per head per day for the rest of the population, including all the older children. If the priority requirements are disregarded, the amount available on an equal division over the whole population is from a quarter to a third of a pint per head per day. This, having regard to- the fact that liquid milk is, even under present conditions, one of the cheapest and most nutritious foods generally available, is admittedly too low. Consumption in New York, for example, where the milk is graded by the Department of Health, was during last winter at the rate of three-fifths of a pint per head per day.But even the low standard of supply in this, country is precarious. During the last two years before the war there were signs of a shortage of liquid milk in the winter; and under the present conditions of dairy farming (rising wages, long hours of work, attraction to other less onerous types of farming, increasingly stringent sanitary requirements) there is no assurance that shortages will not continue and increase in severity. On this point the Boards of Agriculture and representative producers are unanimous.In 1871 there were in the United Kingdom eight cows for every 100 of the population; in 1914 there were only seven. With the exception of France, the United Kingdom carries a. low number of cows per 100 cultivated acres than any European country. Unless definite steps are taken to guarantee to the producer an adequate price for milk, it seems impossible to count on any increase in the supplies, and there is even risk of a decline, particularly if prices of other agricultural produce are guaranteed and if the regulations necessary to secure the desired improvement in the quality of milk with all their attendant expense to the producer are to be enforced.
18. To improve the quality of milk. It is generally admitted that, owing to disease in milking herds and contamination on the farm, in dealers&apos; hands and in transit, much of our milk supply is in a very unsatisfactory condition, particularly in the large towns in which the supply comes through many hands. The great bulk of the milk&apos;in this country is of a quality that would only be allowed to be sold for cooking and manufacturing purposes in New York.To remedy these defects improved farm inspection and more vigilant and continuous control over the conditions of handling at the various stages of distribution is necessary.Some of these measures can no doubt be taken under the Milk and Dairies Act without extension of control over trading operations in milk. Nothing, however, can be done under that Act to provide for the extra expense to which producers will thereby be put. Nor can an economic motive be given to improve quality unless power is taken to fix differential prices for milk according to quality.A system of grading according to quality and purity with differentiation of prices and power to license dealers should be introduced.19. To prevent the domination of the trade by private organisations. The United Dairies, Limited, known as the &quot; London Milk Combine,&quot; is a powerful business organisation which, starting in 1915, has gradually absorbed the bulk of the wholesale and retail milk trade of Greater London, and at present controls about 80 per cent, of the milk supply in that area. It has also acquired or erected about 70 milk depots and factories scattered widely throughout the country. If the State stands aside this growth will continue unchecked, placing the consumer at the mercy of a powerful monopoly controlling an essential food. Great economies in distribu-tion have been effected by this organisation, especially on the retail side. Under a State system pursuing a similar policy the advantages of these economies would accrue to the consumer.On the other hand, producers also are organising under the auspices of the Agricultural Organisation Society, and dealers and consumers are apprehensive that a combine of producers may thus grow up whose primary interest is to secure advantages for the producers. Here again the consumers interests are not directly considered and could only be safeguarded by some form of State control.20. To effect economies in the Wholesale and Retail Distribution of Milk. At present there is throughout the country much overlapping and unnecessary expense in the collection and distribution of milk. In the collecting areas, rival concerns establish depots and organise systems of motor collection, each in its own interest. There is necessarily no comprehensive view of the requirements and no adjustment of claims to tap the sources of supply. Especially in time of shortage this wasteful competition occurs.In the wholesale distribution milk is sent unnecessarily long journeys and cross transport, frequently occurs, with consequent detriment to quality and increased cost.   Under a system of unified control, zones of collection would be prescribed, factories could be properly placed, and areas to supply the various urban centres defined.In the retail trade, especially in towns, there is great waste in provision of vans, rounds-men, shops and utensils. The experience of the United Dairies in London has shown the great economies that may be secured by a comprehensive scheme of retail distribution in which traders are allocated to properly mapped out districts.The municipalities could, under a national system, effect very great improvements in this respect with consequent advantage to the consumer from the economies attained.21. To effect equitable distribution in times of shortage. Until measures to increase the -winter supply of milk are taken (and even when taken they will not be operative for some time) the supply of milk in winter is likely to be below not only the standard recommended by medical men, but below the actual demands of the consumers, and the disparity between summer and winter production will continue. The experience of the Ministry of Food has shown &quot;that equitable distribution of a short supply can only be achieved by some form of unified control. During the winter 1918-19, when supplies were low, the Ministry found it necessary to arrange many diversions from one area to another, to reduce substantially the amount of milk used in the manufacture of milk products, and to restrict consumption.In the absence of such arrangements, the supplies of milk would have been very unequally distributed and condensed milk, for example, would have been made in substantial quantities at a time when the country required all its production in the form of liquid milk.Such arrangements can only be made by a controlling department with a staff of local milk officers who day by day watch the state of supply and demand. Control of prices alone is not sufficient to ensure equitable distribution in time of shortage, since such control offers no induce-^ent to producers to send their milk to areas which are deficient in supplies.IV.  Conclusion.22. There can be no question as to the need, in the interests of public health, for improving materially ^ the present conditions of the milk supply. The only question is whether the object in view can be achieved by any less far-reaching proposals.    On this the main point for
decision is as to whether or not it is necessary to guarantee a price for milk. Unquestionably the fixing of this guaranteed price from time to time would be a matter of great difficulty, owing to the lack of definite information as to costs of production and to large variations in the cost between different parts of the country and different farms. There is the further risk that if a relatively high price were fixed with a view to increasing production, it might prove impossible for the Milk Board to get the milk consumed at that high price. The difficulty could not be met by conversion of the surplus milk into cheese, since on that also there would be a loss which must be covered in the price charged to the public for liquid milk.23. It can hardly be doubted, however, that if the quality of milk could be guaranteed it would be possible to secure a very largely increased consumption. The administrative diffi-culties of fixing the proper price and disposing of the milk, though real, can hardly be regarded as insuperable. On the other hand, if nothing is done to guarantee prices, it is possible, and, indeed, only too likely, that the milk supply will tend continually to decline, and it is certain that the trade wall be dominated by a Trust.It is urged, accordingly, that the reasons for control definitely outweigh its risks, and that control should be undertaken.APPENDIX.scheme of milk control submitted by the associated milk producers&apos; council.Milk Control Board.1.   a Milk Control to be set up by Parliament and constituted as follows:  Official Members.Chairman appointed by the Government. A representative of Ministry of Health. A representative of Board of Agriculture.Unofficial Members (unpaid).Three Producers&apos; representatives nominated by the Central Agricultural Advisory Council. Three Consumers&apos; representatives nominated try the Consumers&apos; Council. One Retailers&apos; representative. \Note 1. If the Chairman is not a Minister responsible to Parliament, separate provision must be made for the representation of the Board in Parliament.Note 2. If the scheme is applied to Scotland it will be necessary either to set up a separate Board for Scotland, or to provide for adequate Scottish representation on the Board without disturbing the proportions laid down above.2. The Milk Control Board will be provided from moneys voted by Parliament with such staff as it will require, and will be charged with the following duties:  (a) To encourage the increased production of milk and the improvement of quality. (6) To encourage the increased consumption of whole milk of good quality, (c) To fix from time to time the prices of milk and milk products.(cl) To define Milk Clearing House areas, and to approve or, where necessary, establish temporarilyClearing House organisations for those areas. (?) To appoint Local Milk Commissioners, and through them to regulate the distribution of milk.(1) With a view of preventing unnecessary transport by seeing that supplies are not sent to a distant market when markets nearer in distance or more accessible are open.(2) With a view of preventing undue shortage of supplies in any district by regulating distribution according to the total supplies available.(/) To acquire by compulsory purchase wholesale milk businesses and depots other than those&apos; owned by Producers&apos; Associations, and also, if necessary, milk products factories, and to maintain and manage them until taken over as hereinafter provided by Producers&apos; Associations.(//) To make the necessary arrangements with the Railway Companies for adequate and regular sendee, and for the proper care of milk during transit, including the provision, where necessary, of refrigerated cars.Local Government Board (or Ministry of Health).o iiie l/ocal Government Board, after consultation with the Milk Control Board, and with the con-currence of the Board of Agriculture, will from time to time define each grade of milk under the Milk and Dairies Consolidation Act, 1915. (The policy of the Local Government Board will beto secure gradual improvement of the quality and condition of milk supplies by increasing from time to time the stringency of the definitions.)4.   The Local Government Board will be responsible  (.1) For the licensing- ^(a) of all farms on which milk is produced for sale; 0(b) of retailers.(2) For the issue from time to time of certificates to farms in accordance with their relative fitness for milk production, provided that these certificates shall be revised where it is proved to the satis-faction of the Milk Control Board that the milk produced from the farm is maintained at a standard above or below that indicated by the certificate.(3) For inspecting and taking samples of milk sold, provided that the regulations governing the issue or refusal of licences will require in the case of (1) (a) the concurrence of the Board of Agriculture, and in the case of (1) (b) that of the Milk Control Board.
( Clearing Houses,5. The Milk Control Board will establish Clearing&apos; Houses to which or by whose authority all milk must be sold. These Clearing Houses will, guarantee the grade and condition of all milk as delivered to the pur-chaser&apos; s railway station, or at his premis.es if road-borne. - Where a breach of warranty results from default on behalf of a Hallway Company, the Mill; Control Board should indemnify the Clearing House and take such other action as may be necessary.6. The Clearing House may authorise the producer to sell milk direct to retailers or consumers, and such authority shall not he unreasonably withheld, but may, subject to an appeal to the Milk Control Board, revoke such authority at any time if the Clearing House is not satisfied: that the quality and condition of the milk is being maintained, and will undertake, on reasonable notice being given, to purchase all milk for which the producer cannot otherwise find a market.7. The area to be covered by each Clearing House will be defined by the Milk Control Board. Sufficient and suitable depot or factory accommodation must be provided in connection with each Clearing House for the regulation of supplies, the treatment and replacement of low-grade milk, and the conversion of surpluses.8. Existing producers&apos; organisations registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, and approved by the Milk Control Board for the purpose, will be recognised at once as Clearing Houses. Where such, organisations do not at present exist, the Milk Control Board will set up temporary Clearing Houses, to be managed by them with the assistance of local advisory committees of producers, on the con-dition.that these will be replaced by producers&apos; organisations as and when formed, provided by the producers with the necessary funds, and approved for the purpose by the Milk Control Board.9. The Clearing Houses will be responsible for the grading of all milk produced within their areas, and for the regular testing of samples from each farm by chemical and bacteriological tests. The services of these Clearing Houses could also be utilised for the purpose of encouraging milk-recording, ascertaining the costs of production and promoting the improvement of dairy stock in their areas.10. Except those owned by producers&apos; organisations, all existing wholesale milk businesses which will be required as an integral part of the Clearing House arrangements will be acquired by the Milk Control Board by compulsory purchase at a price to be fixed by arbitration in default of agreement, but to include I no payment for goodwill except in respect of existing contracts. Superfluous milk depots will be closed, and the Clearing Houses will be empowered to repurchase from the Milk Control Board those depots which are needed for the purposes of Clause 7.The Milk Control Board will be empowered to purchase milk product businesses as and when necessary under similar conditions.Local Milk Commissioners.11. Local Milk Commissioners will be appointed by the Milk Control Board to control the distribution of all milk produced for sale within their district.&apos;12. The districts to be covered by those Commissioners will be defined by the Board, and may either be co-terminous with a Clearing House area, or may include two or more such areas.13. Their primary duty will be to regulate the distribution of milk so as to secure that the maximum demand for whole milk shall be met before supplies are allocated for the manufacture of milk products.Prices and Distribution.14. The price at which whole milk of each grade shall be sold by the Clearing House will be fixed from time to time by the Milk Control Board, with due regard to the necessity of enabling the Clearing House to give the producer an adequate return on cost of production, while leaving the Clearing House a sufficient margin to cover the following services :  (a) The cost of collection, if any, from the farm.(b) The cost of transport to the purchasers railway station (or to his premises if road-borne).(c) The regulation of supplies.(d) The replacement of de-graded milk.(e) The conversion of surpluses.(/) The provision and maintenance of churns.(g) The cost of chilling where this has to be done at a depot.(h) Management and overhead charges.(i) Payment of interest at 6 per cent, on capital invested in the Clearing House and its depots. (j) Fund to meet depreciation of plant and machinery.(7c) Provision to meet bad debts.(I) Sinking Fund for amortisation of depots and equipment which will eventually become superfluous. (m) Any other services performed by the Clearing House, including the encouragement of gradual improvement of quality and the levelling up of winter and summer supplies. Note. It shall not be the policy of the Clearing House to make a profit on the milk for whichit is responsible, apart from such savings as may be effected out of the margins provided for the above-mentioned services.15. The price charged by the producer who is authorised by the Clearing House to sell milk of any grade direct to the retailer will be the same as that charged by the Clearing House, and will cover the cost of transport to the purchasers railway station, or to his premises if road-borne. The Clearing House shall make a charge, subject to an appeal to the Milk Control Board as to the amount charged upon the producer for the granting of such authority, in order to cover the services rendered to him by the Clearing House. Similar authority will be required for direct sales by the producer to the consumer and under similar conditions, except that the producer will sell to the consumer at the retail price fixed for the district.16. The Clearing House will be responsible for maintaining a regular supply of milk to provide for the needs of its area, and, when those needs have been met, will sell milk to distributors outside the area in accordance with the directions of the Local Milk Commissioner.17. The Clearing House will be authorised and required to charge a deposit on churns not exceeding th cost of replacement.18. The retailer will sell to the public at a price to be fixed according to grade by the Milk Control Board, provided that in any particular area the Board, after consultation with the Local Milk Authority, if any, shall have the power to fix special retail prices. If provision is made by a local authority with the approval of the Local Government Board for the supply of milk of good quality to children or other persons at a reduced cost, the deficiency shall be met out of local and Imperial funds. .19. The Milk Control Board will be empowered, where necessary, to fix the wholesale prices of milk products frcm time to time.
Local Milk Authorities.20. Where the Milk Control Board considers that the retail distribution of milk in any consuming area needs to be regulated by a special authority, a local authority may be constituted for the purpose under the County Borough, Borough or Urban District Council, and its powers may be exercised either direct or through a special organisation approved by the Milk Control Board for this purpose. The functions of this Authority will be limited to supervising retail distribution and advising the Board in regard to any variation of retail prices.March 31st, 1919.Note.
