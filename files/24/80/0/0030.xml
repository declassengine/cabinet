(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)) jfTHE POLICE UNION AND POLICES PAY. $$Circulated by the Home Secretary).MEMORANDUM   FOR   THE   WAR   CABINETi1 IIn connection with the Polios. Strike in August last (when P.C. Thiel who had been dismissed for joining the Police Union contrary to the Commissioner&apos;s Order was reinstated at the request of the Prime Minister) it was agreed by the Home Secretary and the Commissioner of Police that, while the Union would not be recognised as entitled to represent the men, Constables would not be forbidden to join the Union so long as the Union &quot;does not claim or attempt to interfere with the regulations and discipline of the Service, or to induce members of the Force to withhold their services&quot;.This agreement was accepted by the Constables&apos; represent-atives and signed by Mr. Marston, then Vice-President and now President of the Union.At the same time the Home Secretary agreed to the establishment of Representative Boards, elected by the Police &quot;to represent the members of the Palice Force In matters connected with their conditions of service and general welfare (other than questions of discipline)&quot; -    This was agreed to by the men&apos;s representatives in the same way. ;We have now had 9 months&apos; experience of the working of this arrangement.      It has been given a full trial and has proved a complete failure?   and I am now satisfied that the maintenance of discipline in the Police Force cannot be maintained if the men are allowed to belong to any Union.The agreement accepted and signed by Mr. Mars ton ha^s been entirely disregarded by the Union and by those who claim to be the men&apos;s leaders.From the first the Union set out to oontrol the Representative Board and its Executive Committee, and has
- 2 - *iexercised its influence upon the Board and the Committee to induce them to interfere with questions of discipline and has induced the Committee itself to be guilty of grossly indisoiplinary conduct, such as could not be tolerated in an individual Constable.The Police Union has also repeatedly attempted to interfere with Police Regulations, and to support officers who had been punished for disobedience to orders.    This reached a climax in the meeting in Trafalgar Square on the 4th May, when a resolution was passed &quot;That this mass meeting of Police and Prison Officers strongly protests against the barbarous punishment meted out to Constable Spackman, Metropolitan Police, and demands his Immediate reinstatement and reconsideration of his case;   and, further, protests against the many recent vicious punishments inflicted on members of the Metropolitan Police, and demands that they be at once reviewed, and insists that all future punishments be in due proportion to the nature of the offence committed.&quot;     P.G. Spaokmar was dismissed for deliberately directing Constables to disobey the Commissioners orders.    The other &quot;vicious punishments&quot; were dismissals of men who deliberately and repeatedly left their beats at night.In disregard of the Agreement, the Union has claimed the right for the Police to strike, has omitted from its rules the regulation which prohibited a strike, and has  inserted one which provides for a strike on a two-thirds majority in a vote by ballot of all members of the Union.It has become perfectly obvious that if the Constables are allowed to maintain the Union or to belong to it, the authority of the Commissioner and discipline will soon be at an end.The crisis is likely to come in a few days.    There is reason to believe that a seoret ballot on the question of striking in support of the demand for Spaokmanfs reinstatement ar for &quot;full and frank recognition of the Union&quot; is now being taken; there is to be a mass meeting of the Police in Hyde Park on .5aturd
f!bJwJNfie;l   and if the two-thirds majority is obtained a 24 hours ultimatum, it is said, will be sent to the Government to be followed by a strike in which the Police will be supported, it is alleged, by a strike of the Triple Alliance.Meantime, the question of police pay and conditions of service is being Investigated by a parliamentary Committee, of whieh Lord Desborough is Chairman.    The Committee will still take some weeko to complete its enquiry on the question of pay, but I have reoeived a letter from Lord Desborough whioh indicates that the Committee will recommend a large increase.    The increase proposed corresponds closely to the demand put forward by the witnesses representing the Police Union, and, if it is granted unconditionally, it will be treated as a victory for the Union (who have been carefully preparing the ground for this claim) and will greatly strengthen their hands.It seems to me necessary to bring matters te a head before the Union orders a strike and before the increased pay is granted. I submit to my colleagues the following proposals:(1) I propose to make it an absolute rule that no Constable is is to join, or to remain a member of, a Union.     I propose to do this by legislation:   it is a matter in whioh I oannot aot without the support of the House of Commons,&apos;   and in any case legislation will be necessary if the Police pay is to be increased.    I think the Bill should provide (a) that any person who is a member of any Trade Union or Association, including any-&apos; Union consisting wholly or in part of polioe officers, should be disqualified from holding the office of Constable in any Police Force;   (b) that it should be a criminal offence to attempt to cause disaffection among the Polioe or to induce them to withhold their services;   (c) that any Constable continuing to act, after being disqualified under (a) or dismissed under (b), should be incapable of being re-employed in any Police Foroe.(2) I propose at the same time to give the Polioe a statutory.* a&apos; .*
f 4 -right for the presentation of their grievances to the authorities by requiring the establishment of Representative Committees in every Police Force and a Central Representative Committee for the whole of England and Wales, - these Committees to be established in accordance with regulations to be made by the Secretary of State.(3) Provided these conditions are accepted, I propose to grant the Police the increased rate of pay recommended by Lord Desborough/s Committee.     (I append a copy of the Committee^ letter).     This will mean an increase of pay in the Metropolitan Police of 136 per cent, on pre-war rates:   and taking England and Wales a3 a whole, the increase will be about 150 per cent. Compared with the present expenditure on pay and war bonus, there will be an inoreased charge in the Metropolitan Polioe of about  1,750,000 a year, and for the whole,of England and Wales, including the Metropolitan Polioe, of about&quot;  5,000,000 half of which will fall on local rates and half on the Treasury.    There will also he an inoreased charge, growing annually for pensions. Legislation will be necessary to give effect to the proposal, ao the Police Rate in London for the present year is fixed at 9d., the statutory maximum, and an increase of the rate by about 4d. will be necessary to meet the inoreased charge.(4) I propose at t*&apos;e same time to accept the ocherae put forward by the Commissioner of Police to meet a difficulty which has arisen in the i-ietropolitan Police in connection with&apos; their Provident Association owing to the action of the Union in obtaining control of the Provident Association and using that control as an instrument for compelling unwilling members of the Force to join their body.     I append a brief statement by the Commissioner.    The cost of the Commissioners proposal will be trifling compared with the heavy charge arising from the increase of pay at first about  30,000 a year, diminishing annually. The Commissioner considers this neoessary in order to deal with
the grlevanoe created hy the action of the Union.(5) I think it will be desirable that the legislation to be introduced should provide that the Secretary of State is to regulate by general rules the pay and conditions of service of all Police Forces in England and. Wales.    The necessity of uniformity in this matter which is demanded by the men!s representatives is now generally recognised, but it has to be enforced by the awkward method of threatening to withdraw the Government grant.I ask for an immediate decision upon my proposals.    It is most important that the Government should move before they are placed in the position of appearing to be forced to move by the action of the Union.     I intend, therefore, if the Cabinet approve my proposals and my intention, to make a statement setting out the proposals in Orders next Thursday.
i i nAPPENDIX I16th May, 1919.Dear Mr. Shortt,&quot;When you appointed the Committee of whioh I am Chairman to inquire into the Polioe Service, you intimated to ne your desire that the inquiry should be pressed forward with all practicable despatch, and I understand you particularly desire to have some pronouncement of the question of pay of the Police&apos;, as soon as possible.     I think, therefore, it may be convenient if I indicate the position the inquiry has now reached.We have held 21 sittings and have examined 94 witnesses, including the Commissioners of the Metropolitan and City Police, the Receiver, Mr. Thomson and Sir Edward Henry:   Sir Leonard Dunning and General Atcherloy, H. M, Inspectors of Constabulary:   11 witnesses from various ranks of the Metropolitan Polioe and 4 from the City Police:   12 Chief Constables (representing the Chief Constables of 3 of the 8 District Conferences):   26 representatives of the various ranks of 7 County Polioe Forces and 24 from 8 City and Borough Forces in England and Wales,    We shall have to hear a few further witnesses from English Police Forces and recall&apos; some witnesses who have already given evidence, but I think the evidence we have heard.is a fairly oonplete representation of the point of view of the rank and file and of the Chief Constables&quot;.    As regards the Police Author-itieS&apos;, we have heard witnesses from the Watch Committees of the large City and Borough Forces, but we have still to hear evidence from the County Polioe Author-ities and the latch Committees of the Non-County Boroughs&apos;.    We are now proceed-ing to hear evidence from the Scottish Police and Police Authorities and expect to complete this evidence on similar lines by an early day in June.The Committee have been much impressed by the ovidenoe from all ranks of the Police Service regarding the inadequacy of the present rate of pensionable pay.    The men have represented to us feelingly, and-, wo believe, with sincerity, that it is very difficult at present to maintain themselves in a manner which befits them as members of the Police Service, and that it is practioally imposs-ible to do so if they are married and have a family to support:   and we consider that their contention is borne out by the budgets of family expenditure whioh we have examined, even when all allowances are made for the circumstances in whioh these budgets have been prepared.The present pensionable pay of the Police also seems to the Committee inadequate in comparison with tho present earnings of unskilled and semi-skilled workers.    life do not forget that the Police have regular employment and pensions on an exceptional basis, but on the other hand the policeman is put to certain special expenses by reason of his employment, and he is not allowed to add to his earnings by undertaking other work in his odd time;    Beyond this, we consider 1 it is highly desirable in the publio interest that the Police should be a well paid Service and that the members of it should be able to maintain themselves and their families in a bettor way than the class among whom they live.     Tho duties of the Police have increased and are still increasing in variety and coin-complexity, and it is important that the Service should attract tho right class of mar..
Por those reasons the Committee will undoubtedly reoommend an adequate increase in the permanent remuneration of the Police, and that the pensionable pay in particular (should be increased accordingly,Wo have also come to the conclusion that the Polioe Service should be considered more as a whole for the purpose of settling pay and conditions of service, and that, in particular, the pensionable pay should be on a uniform scale for all Forces iu England and&apos; Wales - Metropolitan, City of London and County and Borough Forces alike.     The case of Scotland may present special features.Further, with a view to equalisation of housing conditions we consider that all constables should either be provided with houses owned or rented by the Police Authority (as many of the County Constables now are) or should receive non-pensionable allowances in lieu.    We have not yet decided whether the houses should be rent free or whether a small rental should be charged and the allow-disturbances in lieu adjusted accordingly.As to the Scale of Pay we are likely to recommend, obviously we cannot commit ourselves and we are anxious that we should not be committed in any way to any specific figure until we have completed the evidence, but unless we find strong grounds for modifying the views we have already formed, I think the Com-mittee will probably recommend a scale which will bring the remuneration of a Constable to not less than 75/- rising to 95/- for a Constable living rent free, with proportionate increases for the higher ranks.    We have not, however, decided whether the whole or part of the scale should be pensionable or whether non-pensionable allowances should be retained varying with the local rates of wages and cost of living.    We are inclined to recommend the abolition of special allow-ances for ohildren,    The Table which I enclose shows how the scale I have men-tioned compares with the scales at present in force in typical Polico Forces.We also consider that the pay, allowances and conditions of service ofall forces should be brought more under the control of the Home Office, and inparticular that the standard scale of pay should be fixed and brought under review from time to time by the Home Office.. We shall also have to report on the whole question of pensions and particu-larly the improvement of the widows&apos; pensions, and tha pensions of men who have been retained in the Force under Section 2 of the Police (Emergency Provisions A;-.&apos;, 1915.If the pensionable pay and conditions of service are to be standardised, as we consider they should be, it seems to us essential that means should be provided at the same time to enable the Police as a whole, as well as the Police Authorities to submit their views to the Home Office with regard to any changes of pay or any other matters affecting the service as a whole, e.g, through a Central Board including representatives of (a) the various ranks of the Polico chosen by the men themselves, (b) Chief Constables, (c) Police Authorities, presided over by a representative of the Home Office.As you will see from the above remarks, our recommendations if carried out, are likely considerably to alter the relations between the Home Office and the

APPENDIX II.THE PROVIDENT ASSOCIATION.The following are brief particulars of the Provident Association)-This Association is managed by the men and the Commissioner has no control over it.It has been established since 1892, and it is much to the credit of the Metropolitan Police Force that it has been so long maintained in a satisfactory condition.Without entering fully into details. I may explain that the payment from the Association consists Df a levy of -^d. for every subscriber (Inspector. Sergeant and Constable) when the member retires and Id. when he dies. Sergeants subscribe in addition 3d. and l/- respectively to a Sergeant, and Inspectors l/6 and 7/6 respectively to an Inspector.Nearly every member of the Force has subscribed to it during the whole of his service.     Each man, in his turn and when his time comes for leaving receives from his comrades a lump sum, based on the fixed levy.For accounting purposes the levies upon the men are equalised as far as possible over a long period and the normal weekly contribution from a Constable has averaged about 6d; but extra demands have been met by increased levies.It will be seen that the only basis for the working of the Association is the good-will of the men.     The Police Union are making great efforts to obtain control of it. and it will be obvious that, in view of its mutual interests and obligations, such control might and would be improperly used so as to squeeze out any subscribers who were not members of the Union and, in effect, to seoure the whole Force as members of the Union.After a man has been a subscriber for a number of years he is naturally anxious not to lose the privileges of the Association and rather than subject himself to the possibility of this loss, it would not be surprising if he threw in his lot with the Union even if he were not otherwise disposed to join it.It is obvious that the Association is only solvent as a going concern. If at any time it ceases to exist men who have subscribed for a large number of years for payments to their former colleagues would be left stranded without any means of redress.
