In accordance with the instructions contained in the Minutes of the 13th Meeting of your Committee, held on the 2nd October, 1918, an Inter-departmental Committee comprising representatives of the following departments was set up to consider the National Security Bill dealt with in the third Interim Report of the War Office Emergency Legislation Committee:-Members of the Committee.Viscount Peel..............Chairman.Mr. W.

Macpherson, M.P., when he became the Secretary of State for Ireland.The Hon. Wm. Fiulay, K.C., was nominated to take the place of Mr. W. H. Malkin, who was first nominated to represent the Foreign Office, but was compelled to resign owing to the necessity for his attendance at the Peace Conference.In the unavoidable absence of Sir R. H. Brade, his place was taken by Mr. J. A. Corcoran at the more recent meetings of the Committee.Sir P. B. Wilbraham ceased to be a member of the Committee prior to the issue of this Report, and the vacancy was not filled.Terms of Reference.To redraft the National Security Bill (or the most important Clauses thereof) as an amending Bill to the Official Secrets Act, 1911.2. The Committee, which has held four meetings, in the first instance considered the amendments and extensions to the Official Secrets Act, 1911, which were recommended by the War Office Emergency Legislation Committee. The Committee deemed it desirable to reduce the amendments and extensions as much as possible, retaining only those which experience has shown likely to be necessary in the time of peace. The Committee were of the opinion that the placing in the hands of a &quot;competent authority&quot; of the exceptional powers entrusted to such authorities under the Defence of the Realm Regulations would, in the time of peace, meet with serious opposition, and they decided therefore not to adopt those amendments proposed by the War Office Emergency Legislation Committee, which involved the introduction of a &quot; com-petent authority/&apos;3. The Committee then considered at length a draft amending Bill prepared by the Parliamen-tary Counsel. This was subjected to considerable amendment in the course of the Committee&apos;s discussion, and the attached draft Bill was finally approved and accepted. The Committee recommend that the revised draft Bill should be introduced in Parliament at the earliest possible date.4. The main provisions are as follows: Clause 1 (1). Unauthorized use of uniforms, falsification and misuse of official documents, andpersonation.5. The Committee are advised that acts of this nature, when committed for &quot;the purpose of gaining admission to a prohibited place, or for a purpose prejudicial to the State should be forbidden, as they are not covered by any current legislation.Clause 1 (2). Improper retention and, misuse of ojicial documents.6. These acts may have consequences to the State of a serious nature. They are not at present provided against, and the Committee are of opinion that they should be made offences under the Act.
Clause 2. Communication with foreign agents abroad,7. The Official Secrets Act provides restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, but it does not give any power to deal with persons in communication with foreign agents who are outside the United Kingdom, The Clause is a modified form of Regulation 18a, which has proved useful during the war as a deterrent against the creation of such channels of information. In order that persons wrongfully communicating with foreign agents may be brought to justice, it is proposed that in proceedings for an offence of obtaining or attempting to obtain information useful to the enemy, proof of communication with a foreign agent should be evidence of such offence.Clauses 3 and 6. Obstructing authorities in the execution of their duties wider the Act.8. These Clauses are useful in securing the prompt and accurate investigation of suspected offences under the Act, and tbey provide for the protection of persons officially entrusted with duties under the Act.Clause 4. Power to require the production of foreign telegrams.9. A scrutiny of the originals of telegrams sent from, and received in the United Kingdom, is at times essential to the State in order to deal with attempts at espionage by foreign Governments. The Committee consider that this Clause should be included as the powers of censorship remaining after the Avar will be inadequate. It gives the Secretary of State powers with regard to telegrams sent direct by the cable companies, which he already possesses with regard to all telegrams sent through the Post Office.Clause 5. Registration and, regulation of persons providing accommodation addresses for correspondence.10. This Clause follows Defence of the Realm Regulation 22b which has proved of con-siderable utility in tracing suspected persons who have been conducting illicit correspondence.11. The remainder of the Bill provides improved legal procedure, deals with trial and punishment of offences under the Act, and in some cases increases the maximum punishment in view of the gravity -to the State of the offences dealt with.12. The Schedules contain minor amendments bringing the text of the Act up to date, together with consequential amendments and repeals.PEEL (Chairman). EDWARD TROTJP. (1 R. BR1GSTOCKE. W. J. EVANS. J. A.
