From Viceroy, 2$lh May 19.1.9. (Received 29th, 1.15 pan.)Clear the line.Secret. Afghanistan. Following telegrams from Iioos-Keppel, dated 27th May:-First, &quot;Ten hours. Abandonment of Tochi posts has had the inevitable result on North Waziristan militia. Up to date they have been quite staunch and keen, but tliey and the tribes consider our sudden retirement great victory for Afghan forces and do not believe reports of our success on Khyber and Mohmand fronts. Militia at Miran (Shall ?) said to be very restless and excited and garrison of many posts deserting. Miranshah Serai burnt; no further details yet. Wazir force telegram: &apos;Following message received by wireless telegraphy from Sarwekai: nil Kach ordered to destroy all ammunition and stores, evacuate post and join party at Spink (sic) ? hours, 27th instant. VVano retiring to Zhob and Sarwekai to Murtaza, Sarwekai reported to-night by wireless 19.34 hours that everything was being destroyed and no more messages could be sent.&apos;&quot; We have thus lost all Waziristan-Miranshah to Bannu road, which is seriously threatened. Deputy Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan, has ordered Commandant of Frontier Constabulary [group unuecypherable] to hold Sheranni posts so long as he can do so safely. There have been rumours of attempts at concerted risings in Agency and District on the third night of Ramjan. This clanger appeared to be over in view of the general quietness of tribes, but Tochi affair, which is considered victory of Afghans may revive it. Presumably Amir&apos;s resistance will also be stiff. Baluchistan wires 208 L., asking whether force at Tanna sufficient to keep Wazirs and Mahsuds busy, or Avhether they will probably have time to attack Fort Sandeman in force. General Officer Commanding, Frontier Force, is reinforcing Nugent and Bannu ; Mahsuds and Wazirs.may possibly rest content with succes they have gained in freeing Waziristan from the British also [four groups undecipherable], if they take the offensive they will probably attack first Jandola, Tanna, and Murtaza, cutting either alternative railway, &amp;c. It will probably be some lime before they turn their attention to Zhob, if they do so at all. They are hardly likely to make an expedition against Fort Sandeman unless Zhob rises and asks for assistance, even then it is doubtful whether they will leave Waziristan limits. Sherannis will, probably rise. Bhittanis do not like Mahsuds, but if Bhittani country is overrun they will be forced to join them.&quot;Kurram wires the mountain guns have been firing slowly all day from Utsar on Preliher Mountain at unascertainable targets. There was a rush attack of tribesmen led by a Mullah on the militia at Chapri. Latter under Capt. Wilson drove attack back, killing Mullah and-three others ; spirit of Kurram Militia and Turi generally excellent. Mohmands have sent in long letter recounting their services ; translation is being forwarded to you. I shall see jirga to-morrow. Events in Tochi must affect Lower Kuwam and border tribes between Sadda and Hangu, Massozai Alisherzai and Zaimukt Kabul Khel and Tori Khel Wazirs. Bulk of inhabitants of Lower Kin-ram are Sunnis; Upper Kurram is Shiah, and solid on our side, the only Sunnis being .Peiwar Mangal residents in Kurram who are fighting for us. Probably communication will be cut temporarily between Saclda and Thai, but so long as force remains in Upper Kurram, Turis will fight (and as there are plenty of supplies?) in Upper Kurrain, I have no great anxiety about it.. Effect of Tochi&quot;will spread from Lower Kurram tribes to Orakzai and Afridi, at present both tribes are quiet and had every intention of remaining so, but latest news from South must cause (?) revival of excitement. Possibly our advance to Jalalabad may steady them. I anticipate great effect on Orakzai from Mr. Douglas Donald&apos;s appointment to (corrupt group) where he has gone to-day. He has much influence with the tribe. Political Agent, Khyber, reports all well in the Agency, themselves assisting I in guarding road and offer to do service of every kind. Zakka Khels who brought in (?) flying officers were liberally rewarded by Political Agent and went away very pleased with their treatment. They asked as a favour that aeroplanes should not fly-over Bazar Valley, if this can be avoided.&quot;Party of 200 Afridis, mostly Kuki Khels (?&apos;from) Jalalabad with loot, were attacked by Sungar Khel Shinwaris. Twenty Afridis, including six Kuki Khel elders, killed and wounded.   Shinwari losses about the same.   Political Agent, Khyber, is
of opinion this will cause bitter feud between Afridis and Shimvaris Ningrahaiyand will cut off Afridis from Afghanistan. Douglas Donald went to Kohat through (? Tawa) this morning. He reports roads undamaged; traffic conditions normal; attitude of the people in villages most friendly. No other news, all districts quiet.&quot;Second, vide our telegram of the 26th May. &quot; Following are translations of letters mentioned in my No. 14054 R., dated 25th instant, as having been (&apos;? represented to) Dakka by Sultan Ahmad for Habibulla Khan and Abdur Rahman:-First: &apos; Be it known to respected and faithful Abdur Rahman Khan, the envoy of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan, Colonel Ahmad Ali Khan, Habibulla Khan, and Abdul Majid Khan. You intimated through Abdul Aziz Khan, late Afghan envoy, that the British Government had informed you that Kursi had stopped hostilities and that Afghan Government should do the same; we have understood your message. As the British Government have stopped hostilities, we have also issued orders to our various frontiers to the effect that, pending a final settlement, state of war should cease. As there is no telegraphic communication in Afghanistan, information cannot reach whole country and its frontiers in a day, but we have despatched urgent letters and inform you too of our orders. You should carry on the duty entrusted to you. We implore our God for the welfare of all nations of Afghanistan and fervently pray that our efforts may succeed. Rest remains with God.&apos; Second : &apos;Be it known to respected Abdur Rahman Khan, the Envoy, Colonel Ahmad Ali Khan, Colonel Abdul Majid Khan and Habibulla Khan. Yesterday, Friday, 22nd instant, Abdul Aziz Khan, the Envoy, had the honour of an interview and intimated to me your message about the cessation of hostilities. We therefore at once issued urgent orders to various parts and frontiers of our country to stop fighting, but it is strange that while on the one hand British Government ask Afghanistan to stop hostilities, on the other hand they, sent their aeroplanes to-day, Saturday, the 23rd Shaban, at six in the morning, and having bombed Kabul capital, went back. It is a matter of regret that their action should be contrary to what they say. It should not be so. Bombardment has created great excitement in Kabul and its suburbs, and if this line of action continues the Afghan nation will never be easily subdued by fighting. We therefore ask you to make the British understand this. For the rest all is well by grace of God and rest assured in every way. Postscript. Message sent through Abdul Aziz Khan for the cessation of hostilities though verbal was from you, and we accordingly ordered hostilities to be stopped as stated above. Now that aeroplanes have bombed Kabul, I write to say that if the British Government do not really want a truce you should secure formal letter from them to this effect and send it on to me, and if they will not give a formal letter you should inform me so that 1 may act in accordance therewith.&apos;&quot;
