The Air Council desire to support strongly the proposal of the President of the Board of Education that a Committee should be appointed to consider the salaries of scientific rand technical officers in the Government service (G.T. 7108), They concur also in the specific proposal on this subject     A made in Sir Eric Gedd.es&apos; memorandum of May 15th, (G.T. 7258).&apos;:&apos;In endeavouring to arrange for the establishment of a department of civil aviation the Council have been very seriously hampered by the impossibility of offering rates of pay adequate to attract the services of civilians from outside the service with expert knowledge of aviation.In the case of the Department of Supply and Research the same problem has arisen,     There were available at the time of the armistice in the technical Department of the Directorate General of Aircraft Production   a considerable number of officers commissioned temporarily In the Royal Air Force whose work was not the least of the factors in the striking technical progress of aviation during the wsr.        Many of these officers could command good positions and high salaries in civil life and on demobilisation it was impossible to consider the offer to them of terms which it would be worth their while to accept.if their services have accordingly been and are being lost to the State and the same difficulty about rates of pay will make it difficult, if not altogether impracticable^ to obtain the hservices of other persons qualified to replace them.The problem raised by the President of the Board of Education is accordingly one of urgency from the point of view of the Air Ministry, and I would urge the early appointment of the suggested Committee.(Into) J.S, 25,5.19.
