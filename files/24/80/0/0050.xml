^fcOCUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVEF17ME.NT.)SECRET.1fAR CABINET.G.T. 7349.j iCHURCH ASSEMBLY ENABLING BILL.fetter from the &apos;Chaplain of the Archbishop of Canterbury &quot;to the President of the Board ofEducation.Lambeth Palace, S.E.I. 26th May, 1919.Dear Sir,I am much obliged by your letter of the 24th instant with regard to the Enabling Bill which was introduced by the Archbishop of Canterbury on May 13*   The ArohUshop is unfortunate-nately this week in Scotland on important public duties or I am sure he would have wished to write to Mr. Fisher himself.   In his absence I think that my best course will be to send you certain papers and information which may, I hope, put the 3uoition before Mr. Fisher in a satisfactory way.I enclose copies both of the Enabling Bill itself and of the Parliamentary&quot;White Paper which gives, as an Appendix to the Addresses,from the Convocations to the Crown, the Consti-tution of the proposed National Assembly of the Church of England to which, as stated in the preamble of the Bill, the Bill seeks to give &apos; statutory powers.     ThiB White Paper gives the Constitution exactly as passed by the Representative Church Council and printed in the brown paper pamphlet which I also enclose.     That pamphlet (Marked C) gives a draft of the Enabling Bill but the draft in certain very small points is not quite identical with the Bill now before Parliament, and to save confusion I have put a pencil mark through it.I am further sending an important speech by the Archbishop of Canterbury (D) on the proposed scheme, delivered by His Grace to the Representative Church Council last February. In addition to this I send you a brief summary (E) of these proposals and of the events which led to them prepared by an unofficial Committee.The papers which I describe above will give Mr. Fisher the immediate facts relating to the Enabling Bill.     I think, however, that for a fuller understanding of the proposals in the Bill I ought to append a brief statement of the genesis of the proposals. -In July 1913 the Representative Church Council, consist-ing of all the Diocesan Bishops, 275 clergy and 38? laymen representing all the Dioceses of England and Wales, after discussion, passed the following resolution:-&quot;That there is in principle no inconsistency between &quot;a national recognition of religion and the spiritual &quot;independence of the Church, and thib Council requests &quot;the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to consider the &quot;advisability of appointing a Committee to inquire what &quot;changes are advisable in order to secure in the &quot;relations of Church and State a fuller expression of &quot;the spiritual independence of the Church as well as of &quot;the national recognition of religion.&quot;In accordance with this resolution the two Archbishops appointed a strong Committee, presided over by Lord Selborne, and containing among ita members Sir William Anson, Mr, A.J.Balfour,
m   2 WMr. A.L.Smith, Lord Hugh Cecil, Sir Lewis lUbden, *^ ?iBhoP8 nf Liverpool and Oxford, Lord Parmoor, Sir Robert Williams, tne Dean^oflhris? Church aid -others      The Oojjlttee were ,iven as their terms of reference the resolution quoted above.   The Archbishops&apos; Committee reported m July   191b and,the Report 7*8 very widely read and very considerably discussed botn in tne press and in Church assemblies of all kinds.   In November 1917 the Representative Church Council had a full discussion on the Report and at the end of the discussion decided to refer the Report to a Grand Committee of 67 members.   That Committee substantially endorsed the recommendations of the Report though it made considerable amendments.   Their Report was published last November.     In February this year the Report of the Grand Committee was presented to the Representative Church Council which, after prolonged and detailed discussion resulting in further amendments, approved of the scheme as it now stands in the White Paper and the Enabling Bill, with only a single dissentientj the Bishop of Hereford.The Report of the Archbishops&apos; Committee is thus a very important document with regard to the proposals, though some of the details of the proposals in that Report have been consider-ably amended in the proposals finally adopted by the Representa-tive Church Council.   I enclose a copy of the Report of the Archbishops&apos; Committee on Church and State.   The main matter, as you will see, is contained in the first 74 pages.   The sub-otantial amendments made in the present scheme almost entirely affect chapter 5, i2e. the actual Constitution of the National Assembly of the Church of England, which Constitution, though assumed by the Enabling Bill and referred to in it, is not it-self contained in that Bill,It is 8just worth mentioning that in the Constitution as finally adopted by the Representative Church Council the basis of the Church franchise is Baptism,  instead of, as first recommended. Confirmation, and also that the electors of the lay representativds in all the Assemblies, and those representatives themselves, may be of either sex.j&quot; ?ay add that if 1 can ^ive &apos;:ou an^ further information either by letter or by word of mouth I shall be very happy to do*      H1&quot;^ the Archbishop of Canterbury of your enquiry and of what I have written in reply.am,Yours faithfully,(Signed)   G.K .A.BELL.Chaplain.A.H.Kidd, Esq.

During the last fifty years the Anglican Communion has become world-wide; there has been an era of strain upon the Church and of extension at home as well as abroad; a rush of new problems has followed the growth of the population in an age of quick development when men have been eager for efficiency in things spiritual as well as in things temporal. Furthermore, a deepened sense of the responsibilities of a National Church has impressed upon Churchmen the difficulties that confront the Church, as at present organised, in meeting the new problems.These conditions have led to a widespread demand for Church reform. Abuses or obstructions could no longer be tolerated because they were venerable. Such hindrances to spiritual efficiency as the sale of advowsons, the anomalies of the patronage system, the freehold of unworthy clergy, the unsatisfactory condition of Church finance, the lack of an adequate pension scheme for clergy, the inequality of endow-ments, the renting of pews, the uncertainties of promotion, the breakdown of ecclesiastical courts, the overworking of Bishops, the inadequate representation of clergy and laity in the Councils of the Church, the need for reform of the Prayer Book, et:., etc., have all been increasingly felt during the last forty years.PARLIAMENTARY CONGESTION.Owing to the fact that the administrative machinery of the Church of England is embedded in Common Law or Statute
Law or fixed by judicial decisions, none of these reforms can^ be carried out without complicated legislation.   Yet the same period has witnessed the, great.,growth of secular legislation and political upheaval which has resulted in the Parliamentary congestion with which we are familiar.It is,- therefore, not surprising &quot;that the repeated applications for ecclesiastical legislation- by the Church to a House of Commons composed of men of all religious opinions and over-whelmed with the problems of a great Empire have met with little response.Out of 217 Church Bills, some of them dealing with very important subjects, introduced into the House of Commons between 1880 and 1913, thirty-three (mostly trivial) have passed into law, while only one was rejected; whereas 183 have been dropped after receiving hardly any discussion. As the demand for reform grew it became increasingly difficult to secure the passage of any Bill to which there was any opposi-tion however insignificant.   A few examples may be given :Twenty-two of these Bills were Bills designed to end or mend the traffic in advowsons; only one passed the Benefices Act of 1898, and that only with Government assistance. But, owing to concessions which had to be made in Committee to save the Bill, it has proved very inefx&quot;ective, and though several Bills have been introduced during the twenty years which have elapsed none has received any discussion.Forty Bills have been introduced to create new bishoprics, suffragan-bishoprics, or archdeaconries, of which ten passed; i.e,, each one of these simple schemes of administrative develop-ment has been on an average crowded out three times before it finally passed. It took nine separate Bills in nine successive sessions before an adjustment of the stipend of the Archdeacon of Cornwall could be effected, while four different Bills were introduced before the Bishopric of Birmingham could be established, and five Bills were needed for the Bishopric of Sheffield every penny of the funds for which had been voluntarily subscribed by Churchpeople. - Twenty-seven Bills have been introduced to economise or rearrange endowments, but not one of these made any pro-gress in the House of Commons.  These instances could beo .......   ......multiplied. Furthermore, it must not be imagined that the failure of the House of Commons to pass ecclesiastical legisla-tion has meant an economy of Parliamentary time. On the contrary, where obstruction is easy it is most often resorted -to, and a great amount of theltime, of the House of Commons has been Avasted on denominational wrangles.

The Reassembling of the Convocation of Canter-bury in 1852 and that of York in 1861 were followed by the formation, on a voluntary basis, of Houses of Laymen for the Provinces of Canterbury and York consisting of elected representatives-sentatives from, every diocese in 1885 and 1892 respectively, and in 1904 there was constituted (also on a voluntary basis) the Representative Church Council, composed of both Convpca-tions and both Houses of Laymen sitting together. Since, however, the Representative Church Council had no powers beyond those of a debating society, the appetite of the Church for, greater Self-Government was rather whetted than allayed by its existence. On July 4th, 1913, the Representative Church Council passed with one dissentient the following resolution: &apos; That there is in principle, no inconsistency between a national recognition of religion and the spiritual independence of the Church, and this Council requests the Archbishops of (Canterbury and York to consider the advisability of appointing j. a committee to inquire what changes are advisable in order to 3X&apos;c secure in the relation of Church and State a fuller expression of the spiritual independence of the Church as well as of the national recognition of religion.&quot;In response to this the two Archbishops appointed  in January, 1914, &quot; The Archbishops&apos; Committee on Church and olState,&quot; giving to it as its terms of reference the above-men-tioned resolution.  The members of the  Committee were : The Earl of Selborne, KG. (Chairman). The Right Hon. Sir William Alison,&apos; Bart., M.P. (deceased);: The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, M.P. The Right Rev.

Its recommendations were discussed all over the country, in the Press, and at numerous meetings. Its recommendations were in principle approved by 23 Diocesan Conferences, over 400 Ruridecanal Conferences and Chapters, by the Canterbury House of Laymen, by both Convocations. Not a single important Church assembly rejected it. In 1.917 the Representative Church Council considered the Report and delegated the work of drafting a practical scheme thereon to a &quot;Grand Committee of its members, who were to take special note of the various detailed criticisms and suggestions that had been made in the course of the eighteen months&apos; scrutiny by the Church.

Worsley, Bart.In November, 1918, the Grand Committee issued its scheme, which was based on the Report.of the Archbishops&apos; Committee on Church and State, with sundry amendments. The same day the Representative Church Council, following the dis-solution of Parliament, was dissolved.A newly-elected Representative Church Council met in February, 1919, and after having ^considered the scheme clause by clause (as in the Committee stage of the House of Commons), and after having amended it in one or two par-ticulars, passed it with one dissentient (the Bishop of Hereford).In May, 1919, the Convocations embodied the Scheme in a formal Address to the Crown.The Scheme, now the official policy of &quot;the Church, is as under: 
SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH ASSEMBLY AND OF THE ENABLING BILL.The Convocations sanction and provide forthwith for the creation of a Church Assembly constituted as follows : 1. The Church Assembly shall consist of three Houses  The House of Bishops, the House of Clergy, the House of Laity. 2. The House of Bishops shall consist of all Diocesan Bishops. 3. The House of Clergy shall consist of the members of the Lower Houses of the Convocations of Canterbury and York. 4. The House of Laity shall consist of elected representa-I fives from every Diocese.method of lay representation. In every Parish the electors shall annually elect a repre-sentative to the Diocesan Conference of the Diocese.*Every five years the lay representatives of every Diocesan Conference shall elect by proportional representation a number of members of the House of Laity, fixed in accordance with the number of electors in the Diocese.the lay franchise. The electors shall be all persons of cither sex aviio :(a) Arc resident in the Parish, or who habitually worship in the Parish Church.(b) Have attained the age of 18 years.(c) Have been baptised.(d) Declare themselves to be members of the Church of England and not belonging to any other Communion.All representatives must be Communicants of full age and may be of either sex.procedure of the ciiurci-i assembly. 1. The Assembly shall meet annually. 2. The Archbishop of Canterbury (or the Bishop next in precedence) shall preside.j 3. All three Houses will usually sit together, but nothing shall be deemed to have been passed by the Assembly unless t has been passed by a majority in all three Houses.functions of the church assembly. .1. In the event of the Assembly receiving statutory recog-d)* dtiOn it will pass measures of Church Reform which will be ubmitted to Parliament under the terms of the Enabling Bill.ie, ec ne is-in He of ar-l aas&apos;* In large Dioceses the Diocesan Conference may decide that election :omthe parishes shall be to the Ruridecanal Conference and from the Ruri* eoaiial Conference to the Diocesan Conference.
2. The Assembly may pass resolutions on religious, moral and ethical questions, etc. (as the Representative Churchf Council does at present).8. It is not part of the functions of the Assembly to issue any statement defining the doctrine of the Church of England, and no such statement shall be issued by it, but questions touching on doctrine may be debated and voted upon in the form proposed by the House of Bishops.The Enabling Bill.Every Bill passed by the Church Assembly shall be sub-1 mitted to a specially constituted &quot; Ecclesiastical Committee; of the Privy Council.&quot;&apos;(This Committee will consist of about twenty-five members, selected on account of their legal-learning or experience in; public affairs.)*Provision is made for the Ecclesiastical Committee of thcj Privy Council to confer with a Committee of the  Church: Assembly styled &quot; the Legislative Committee &quot; in regard the details of the Bill.   Any Bill may be, if thought fit, referred back to the Church Assembly by the Legislative Committe but neither the Legislative Committee nor the Ecclesiastica Committee of the Privy Council shall have power to amend a Bill.After the Ecclesiastical Committee has sufficiently con sidered a Bill in the final form in which the Church Assembly desires to put it forward, the Ecclesiastical Committee shal make a Report to the Crown upon the Bill.The Bill, together with the Report of the Ecclesiastical Committee, shall then be laid upon the tables of both Houses of Parliament for forty daysf, and copies of them shall be circulated to every Member of Parliament.If the Report of the Ecclesiastical Committee of the Privy Council is favourable to the Bill it shall be presented for the Royal Assent at the end of forty days, unless in the meantime either House of Parliament has by resolution directed that it shall not be so presented.If the Report of the Ecclesiastical Committee is unfavourable to the Bill, at the end of forty days it shall be deemed to have lapsed and shall be withdrawn from the tables of both Houses of Parliament, unless both Houses shall have directed bj resolution that it be presented for the Royal Assent, in whicfl case it shall be so presented. 1* all privy council committees are of course appointed by the croi on the advice of the prime minister, t 40 days signifies 40 parliamentary days-i.e,, eight parliamentarvio
IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPOSALS.(.&apos;! .The importance of the proposals lies in the fact that they Constitute for the first time a &quot;recognised organisation by ulwhich the whole mirid of the Church, clerical and lay, can be dgeffectively expressed.tijj The scheme provides machinery by which the Church could hiproppse measures of self-reform which would be passed with phe consent of Parliament.1 At present, owing to the overburdened condition of Parlia-blrient, it is practically impossible to secure the passage of any ;e!Church Bill without the active participation of the Govern-Inent in power, because a single dissentient M.P. can obstructs! i-Jthe passage of any Bill for which Government time has not jlbeen allotted.   As Government time is always precious, thisis not readily forthcoming.hi The recent reform of Parliamentary procedure does not -clneet the case, because under it every measure of Church Reform tjjwould still be dependent, upon the fortunes of the ballot pr -of the active support of the Government to secure time for :(a) Second Reading.(b) Report Stage.(c) Third Reading.        &apos; , As many of the most urgently needed measures of Church(Reform e.g., Reform of Patronage, or Rearrangement of ^khdowments would necessarily be long and complicated pills, the amount of time the Government would have to pilot would be out of all proportion to what it could afford. The proposals must therefore be considered as a measure 51 if Parliamentary devolution, comparable to the procedure of ^Provisional Order Bills, as much for the relief of Parliament jts for the benefit of the Church.   Yet the scheme ensures to &apos;parliament a real control of all Ecclesiastical legislation.   No jills could be rushed through in the small hours of August mornings.  For eight weeks Members of Parliament would lave before them the official demand of the Church, passed ,iy the Houses of Bishops, Clergy and Laity in the Church lbiVssembly.   They would also have before them the explana-^ ions and criticisms of a learned and weighty Committee of he Privy Council which would contain men of all denomination-ions as well as leading lawyers.   The work of this Committee rould be to explain to Members of Parliament the. exact effect f the Church&apos;s proposals, and its composition would be such rolhat its criticisms could be relied upon as impartial  and iccurate.ltd
This system would afford a mote real&apos;Parliamentary control than at present exists, when Church legislation is introduced^ by private members on their own responsibility and is subject&apos;. f!o   bargains,   lobbying,   blocking , motions,   obstruction,Sintrigues, etc.. Members would have eight weeks with the facts fully before them on which to form a judgment.  At the conclusion; pi ] that time, if thought necessary, a debate on the motion &quot; that, the Bill be presented for the Royal Assent &quot; could take place,: cither after 11 o&apos;clock, or, if the Bill was considered of sufficient importance, at 8.15 or such other time as fixed by the Speaker on the request of, say, 50 or 100 members.   It might be neccsl &apos; sary or convenient to lay down this procedure in a new Standing Order, but that is a matter for the future consideration of thl Government and the House.Therefore, although much House of Commons time woull be saved, the cry which has been raised by the very few Churchmen and Liberationists who oppose the scheme that itta will remove effective Parliamentary control will not beatfjj examination.   Obstruction is the antithesis of Parliamentary; control.  The scheme is designed only to remove obstruction1 which present conditions facilitate.  Unless this can be aceom plished all the hopes of Church Reform to meet the needs ol the new age are vain, and a severe crisis must inevitable result.  English Churchmen are not asking for a positiorj comparable to the autonomy possessed by the Established ,1 Church of Scotland; they are asking only for a reform o: j procedure, a greasing of the wheels of legislation.   To thii demand they attach vital importance.
