From Viceroy, 20th May 1919.(deceived 21st May.) 0Clear the line.Secret.   Afghanistan.   Roos-Keppel reports on .19th May : &quot; Afridis held a big jirga yesterday and decided to send a small deputation to the Sipah Salar at Jalalabad with, the same answer as was given by Orakzai, viz., that they had no quarrel with the British Government and would certainly not rise unless given large quantities of arms, ammunition, money and rations. Incidentally, deputation will reconnoitre for Afghans&apos; weak spots, in case it is decided to loot Afghan camps. There appears to be no prospect of Afridis rising at present, but feelings changes from day to day. Mohmands have sent message that if Yakub Khan has any chance of Kabul throne, all Mohniands and many Nigrahar tribes will join him. It is becoming very difficult to get news from Afghanistan as all my messengers are being killed.&apos;&apos;Satisfactory reports received from all North-West Frontier Districts and Agencies except Kurram, which is greatly perturbed owing to expected approach of Nadir Khan with four battalions, two (? guns), and tribal lashkars, reported 12,000 strong; reported collection of large number of Ghilzais at Gardez and Ali KheJ, and distribution .of arms among the Jaji Alaidan tribesmen. Attempts are being made to shake the Turis&apos; loyalty by enemy propaganda.Meshed reports Herat quiet up to 10th May. No news had arrived from Kabul or elsewhere regarding war, but. it was rumoured that Amir no longer wished to be friendly with us and pleasure was expressed at news of riots in India.In Meshed there is, according to Grey, no pro-Afghan feeling worth mentioning. Sympathy for us is freely expressed and Governor-General with his resources is at our disposal.
