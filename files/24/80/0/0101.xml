(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S C^VERHi&amp;EET&apos;SECRET. ; 9*,REVISE .G.T.7400.     /  J     W A R    CABINET.SEI DISQUALIFICATION (REMOVAL) BILL.Letter from the Parliamentary Counsel to the President of the Board of Education.OFFICE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL, WHITEHALL, S.W.4-th June, 1919.Dear Mr. Fisher,I enclose copies of a fresh draft of the Bill dealing with the&apos; disqualification of women, as to which I am very glad to be fortified by the Attorney-General1s note and suggested formula (G.T.7399), which I return herewith.You will notice that the draft, following the Attorney-General&apos;s suggestion, abolishes sex disqualifications altogether and not only those which affect women.   If the Attorney-General is right in saying that a woman is not legally disqualified from becoming, a barrister (,there is some authority for tho contrary view) her disqualification rosts solely on the fact that women are not in practice admitted to the Bar, and in this sense I to ice it that there are professions,&apos; such as that of nurse er midwife,, for which men are similarly disqualified,   I aia not sure whether it is proposed that these disqualifications should be removed.     The point is perhaps an academic, one, but unless the Bill is in terms confined to disqualifications-affecting women, the title should, be general in terms, and this I have provided for in the enclosed draft.The Attorney-General has restored the reference to disqualification by marriage,   You will remember that whilst   -on the one hand the view was expressed that, apart from dis-qualification on ground of sex, there was no existing disquali-ficatibn on the ground of marriage;   on the other hand the express mention of marriage was considered to be embarrassing in view of the conditions affecting married women in the Civil Service, which it is not proposed to alter.   It would I think be sn advantage if the 73111 (at any rate as introduced) contained no reference to marriage. &quot;   pI have altered the proviso in order to meet     * the case put by Sir $hemss.Heath at the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee last week.It remains for decision whether or not the Bill is to cover ecclesiastical offices, and ecclesiastical functions in general. ,Yours very truly,The Rt. Hon. (Signed)     HUGH GCDLEY.H.A.LoFisher, M.P. Board of Education, WHITBIIALL, S.V/. 1.
