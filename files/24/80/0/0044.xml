For some time I and my advisers have been giving the question of muik control very full consideration, and I J30,w isubirlt the foll-awibg observations on the memorandum circulated &quot;by the Pood Centroller,That document acts out the somewhat unsatisfactory position of the mi Ik supply and the difficulties which may be antic cpated in improving n t ras tc either quality or quantity. With main, of what i.s said I oonDur;    indeed, I consider that the reea-nt rises in wages are likely to injure milk production mere than mo,s.:t of r.!.ie other oranohes of the agricultural industry, and that a serious fall in tho supply of milk may be feared.The comedy proposed by the Ministry of Foci is to put the wholesale crude in milk into the hands of a Government Department. I eonsidor that thereby a whole cioip of new difficulties will he created withouu diminishing in the least the main difficulty which&apos; forms the excuse for nailocalisation of the trade - that milk produeti on under present conditions of labour and capital is nat attractive to the farmer.To a considerable extent milk prodii-ction in Groat Britain is in the hands of small farmers, inadequately furnished with capital and imperfectly educated.  - Buildings are defective and were not iriginaily designed for cow   keeping,     With the shortage of labour less oare than usual is being given to the handling of milk whi.-h is far from frlean.At the same time there is no necessity tc givo way tc exaggerated fears with regard to the health of the- public *     The dirt which finis its way into milk diminishes its keeping quality and therefore its sal ability, but is not any more a menace to tho. health of the consumer today than it has been in the pasto Undauntedly a confidenoble &quot;proportion of the milk sold is also infected with bovine t-uhorc.ul.osisv but while this milk in itu raw condition should not be fed to young babes, the medical profession would not agree that it constitute,,-) any serious danger to a vast majority of its consumers *As regards * clean5 milk I am cf opinion that a wide-spread educational campaign amcngst dairy farmers, differentiation of Quality, and a return tc a regime of competition, under which the purchaser will reject milk that is dirty or will net keep, may be trusted to effect the necessary improvement in the character of the supply.     I agree with the prop-sals of tho Ministry of Pood that milk should in future be sold under more than one grade cf purity-.At the present time notwithstanding feed prices dairy farmer:! are inclined to go cut of the j;r bu sine b sec rather than incrc -&apos;e them.     hairy farming involves a considerable supply cf labour, approximately a man tc every 15 cows kept, beyond thelcTJubJ5ocement is tho property of His Britannic Ma/jcsty&apos;;s Government) . Becret. War Cabinet.&quot;Control of\ the Milk Trade&quot;.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Agriculture andPis her led.
men required for the cultivation of tho farm, and tho reoent increases in the rates of wages, especially tho overtime ratos which all milk producers have to pay., coupled with tho l:i sincVi nation of men to work the er-co optional hourdemanded in the dairy business, inclines farmer a to turn to some le;js oxaoting fo r m o f pr o du - j t i o h.Turning now to the suggested remedy of Government control of the wholesale trade.     This control involve a two elements :-a machinery for fixing prices tc the producer and tc the consumer from month to month;   those would bo fixed not maximum prices, i *c , the State Board would purchase all milk offered to them;a monopoly of the distribution :f milk, involving the purchase of many large distributing businesses including that rf the United Dairies^Taking the last point firtit, the Fed controller s memorandum coos net propose an absolute monopoly, but would permit farmers :.t farmei s - associations tc sell direct to retailers or tc consumers.If competition cn these lines wore permitted the produers in a favourable situation as regards carriage and similar C&quot;nvenicrr re - world do a liroot trade so as to obtain a profit on the allowar.ee mace ici distribution between the wholesale and the retail price,.     Ire State would thus be deft with the mere expensive portion of the trade arid v/should have, to tare the milk of those tc-imers situated at a distance from consuming centres ,     In order to deal with  the surplus in certain months the State will be compelled to enter into tho manufacture of cheese and of other milk&quot; produot3 whi mh are in normal times the resret of milk prsduoors who for some reason find a difficulty in entering the market for fresh milk^     As both Creese and the ether milk prcduots have to compote with foreign imports,  the British monopoly extending only to fresh mil r., it most-be expected that the State will lose money cn tneso manufacturing precedes when they have to buy the raw materi.o,-I at the full fresh milk price.     The losses will have to be spread over the fresh milk sold by the State-&apos;, thus enhancing the differ once between the position of the well -placed producer selling .lireco and the State organisation-,     Either these well -placed farmers will make excessive profits or they will out prices in order to secure their market.     The State organisation will be inevitably driven to insist upon a monopoly.As regards price fixing tho experience of the last two years has not been encouraging,     Fixed prices have aroused bitter discontent and &quot;unrest and yet they permitted many producers to make excessive profits.     GpealJmg generally, they havo resulted in a lower.iing cf quality, and they tend to concentrate the farmer c awe-n-ion upon agitation for an increase of price instead of endeavours tc&apos;reduce costs of production,     fixed prices must be bated upon costs of pro-iuofion. which vary widely from form tc ierr: and from district to district.     If the State take tho average oosr. of pro ducto.cn plus a reasonable pro idol asIt     i-aois of their fixed price, ineff i oient producers will be driven out of the business, whereas others wa11 make unnecessary profits and the State or ana sat j on munt annex some of these profits at the top end of the score in cider to cheapen the average eosi of milk      But the State orgarrjcation must fix its price above tl-.-;- average cost of production since they are responsible for maintaining the nuoniy of1 milk, whereupon thos)(2)
demand to control tho profits of tho economical producers will bo otill more insistent.     All motive for economical production amongst tho efficient farmers will thus be removed.     Farther, as the State Organisation will have to ensure a larger supply cf mil]: produced under bettor aonditions, it will bo necessary for it to find capital for those producers who require better buildings and improved facilitj.ee,     Difficult as it is to find capital for fains at the present time, it will bo impossible to obtain it from privato sources when the industry is so closely controlled,     I consider that tho further step would be inevitable, from control of distribu-tion to control of production,    Any system cf prices permanently -fixed by the State must shortly be followed by national],cation, and the reduction cf the dairy farmer to the position of a manager paid by the State kAs an alternative I suggest that the organisation indicated in tho Iced Controller&apos;s memorandum for setting up local mill: authorities should alone be proceeded with.     This form of control v/ill effect the maximum cf economy in distribution, inasmuch as the greatest amount of overlapping, waste cf labour and spoiling of mill: takes place in the retail distribution.     The local milk authorities would then make their purchases from producers and producers&apos; associations,     They would pay competitive prices. and only by competition can differential prices be attained with their consequent economies to the consuming public.   The local milk authorities with the necessity imposed upon them for obtaining supplies, would ha70 to offer prices thai- would ensure the maintenance of the industry.     The possibility of making long torm contracts with responsible bodies would enable the dairy farmer to obtain capital for development,     In making their contracts the local authorities would be able tc impose mere stringent sanitary conditions, but in view of the obligation upon them to maintain the supply, their seal would be tempered by considerations of occot.I regard this as the only method which will secure economy in distribution and yet maintain the element of compel It, ion upon which. I consider that economical production and improvement rest. The alternative is complete nationalisation of the industry of milk production..The alternative scheme proposed by the Associated Mlk Producers is open tc tho cbjtctions I have already urged in sc far as it involves a State Beard of Control to fix prices,   V/ith the -co-operative proposals I should be in cntrirs sympathy provided competition is ensured by allowing individual producers to sell direct to the local milk authorities.EHKLE,7th hay, 1919.
