Secret. Afghanistan. Roos-Keppel telegraphs 25th May:-"Peshawar District,some unrest reported in Charsadda Sub-Division. This is being dealt with. All other districts defined quiet. Bajaur lashkars were not in time to reach Afghan force in Mohmaud country and have returned home. Our Mohmand Tarakzai Halimzai Isa Khel Burhan Khel have behaved very well and their hostile attitude towards Afghans and Upper Mohmand lashkar contributed largely to influence enemy retirement. Deputy Commissioner, Peshawar, will see Mohmand jirgas at Shabkadr to-morrow, and if his report of their conduct confirms those already received I shall restore Mohmand allowances, which have been forfeited since April 1915. Tirah quite quiet and Afridis in submissive mood are bringing back to Political Agent, Khyber, arms taken by Khyber Rifles deserters. Large number of rifles and battery ammunition brought by Afridis from the sack of Jalalabad constituting serious danger for future, but tribe is now friendly. Kohat Pass Afridis, Orakzai and Zaimukt quiet. Minor incident reported from Kurram, where party of militia was fired upon by Afghan picket. Militia returned fire, killing three of enemy. Desultory firing from (corrupt group). Turis confident. No fresh news from Tochi. Political Agent, Wano, wires from Sarweiki: Abdur Rahman Khel Mahsuds inclined to give trouble over old claim for special allowances, but matter&apos; has been arranged. It is believed that Mahsud jirgas are sending reply to Afghans not to come to their country, but saying that if Tochi, Kurram and Khyber are captured by Afghans, Mahsuds will take Sarweiki and Jandola without outside help. Sardar Habibulla Khan, Colonel Ali Ahmad and (? Sarhdar) Abdul Majid are being deported from here to-morrow by military authorities. One Sultan Muhammad Khan is being detained at Dakka, where he arrived with letters for Afghan delagates and ex-Envoy Abdur Rahman, whom he had apparently missed on road. He will be deported with others. Situation is favourable."
