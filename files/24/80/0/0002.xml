from Viceroy, 20th May 1919. (Received 21st May 1919.)Secret. 19th May. Afghanistan. Your 20-12, 16th May, and our telegram of 17th May. Following extract from AmanulkVs letter to Haji Turangzai dated 10th May : &quot; (R.) We pray God you may remain firm on path of holy war. You will know our ideas from proclamations printed and circulated. We have appointed Commander-in-Chief who will advise you and supply you with ammunition.&quot;Following extracts from Afghan Postmaster, Peshawar, to A maim 11a dated 7th. May: &quot; (R.) Hearing Post Office was to be searched I ordered armed resistance as whole of my correspondence went against British Government. If necessary, I would begin holy war in haven of city. Hearing of this about 8,000 Peshawuris, both Hindus and Moslems, came to help to sack. That night 2,000 villagers from outside offered their assistance. I said I would invite them when the time came. Sikh regiments have assured Hindus that they look on Moslems as brethren and Avill not lire upon them. Government has not sufficient troops in India and often moves about one regiment consisting of two or three companies to make display. In spite of many telegrams sent by Chief Commissioner no regiments have arrived by train. British subjects will not supply recruits. There are disturbances throughout India and troops if sent for from England will not arrive in time. It has been given out in public meeting that Amir and Ghazis are ready to help Indians, and if war is delayed people will be displeased with Amir. (?) cried with one voice they could not forget oppressions and tyranny of British Government. If after sealed leaflets have been circulated and the (corrupt group) Sipah Salar&apos;s (corrupt group) especially refrains from invading India, Hindus and Moslems will be much displeased. It is not expedient to delay and give time to the English to collect troops.&quot;
