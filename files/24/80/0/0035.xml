From Viceroy, 23rd May 1919.

(Received 10.45 a.m., 24th.)



Clear the line.

Secret, Afghanistan. Following from Roos-Keppell, dated 22nd May:-

"Wano reports rumour(s) of enemy at Musa Nikr unfounded. Mulla Fazl din has arrived from Kabul disappointed, and had quarrelled with Mulla Hamz(enol ? ulla), who is inducing Mahsuds to rise, former working against him. Temper of Mahsuds seems excellent; they are attending in large numbers at Sarwekai to receive allowances, and seem (disinclined ?) for war. Tochi telegraphs that Nadir Kahh is delaying matters in Khost, and has given out that he will interview jirgas at Nariza in Tani country for some days, and will then decide date for advance. Foce which has reached Urgun under Shah Wali Khan consists of 1 gun, 2 machine guns, 400 infantry, 100 cavalry, but he expects reinforcements, 3,000 Ghilzais. Previous garrison at Urgun was reported to be 3,000 men with 12 guns. He is expected to arrive Lawara on 23rd. Kohat reports that Biland Khel Wazirs are sending a deputation to Khost Jirga otherwise all quiet in Kohat district and border. Peshawar District large gathering Mohmands in Gandab Valley, Mir Sahib Jan Badshah with them. Babra Mulla is in Pindiali, but up to last night he had no following. Unless advance is countermanded from Jalalabad, enemy may attack Friday, i.e., to-night or to-morrow morning. Jirgas are being held in Buner, reports are tribesmen are still (disinclined ?) for Jehad, but Mullahs are very active. Kurram reports General Muhammad Alam, commanding Kharlachi front, has just received an order from General Nadir Khan in Khost to withdraw his tribesmen as General Nadir Khan is not yet ready to fight. About a thousand tribesmen have been withdrawn leaving force of about a thousand consisting of 300 rugulars, 400 Ghilzais, 300 local tribesmen, with two guns, in front of Kharlachi. Peiwar no change. They say Mulla Mahmud Akhundzada visited Para Chamakanni exhorting them to be ready, they have begged to be excused on account of their insignificance. Tirah Afridis and Orakzais all quiet. No gathering reported anywhere. No signs of any disturbances in Dir, Swat or Black mountain. General situation has improved in my opinion."
