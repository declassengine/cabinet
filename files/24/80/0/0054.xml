From Viceroy, 25th May 1919. (Received 26th, 3.30 pan.)Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, 24th May : &quot;Reported by all districts all quiet except Bannu, whose report not yet received. Hindustani fanatics at Samasata received Amir Aminulla Khan&apos;s Jehad firmans about 14th instant, They were distributed to neighbouring tribes. On ICth instant fanatic Amir preached sermon strongly opposed to Jehad, and told his followers that lie will reconsider the question in a fortnight when Swat and Buner will have shown their hands and crops will have been cut. He is presumably awaiting reply to his communication to Abdul Qadyum. Reply is being sent. Black Mountain tribes held jirga and decided to lead Swat and Buner. Hasszai held full jirga on 19th instant and decided (? no) hostile action whatever, They sent reply to Amir that they were on good terms with Government, and had been well treated, and not only would have nothing to do with Jehad but would resist any force of Ghazis coming through their limits to attack Government. They added, humorously, that they would reconsider the question of joining Afghans when Amir had captured Attock. Buner reported quiet but holding jirga of the tribe. Swat fully occupied in lighting Nawab of Dir and getting in harvest. No hostile movement yet Mohmand border. We have been expecting attack from Hafikor direction yesterday and to-day, but last night Political Agent, Kliyber, received information enemy&apos;s force Mohmand country was retiring, and this is confirmed by air reconnaissances to-day. Airmen report this morning is that enemy in- Mohmand country is in full retreat north-west in two columns, first column lias passed Nahakk. Mohmand militia have stood strain well and have shown keenness. There have been less tfian 30 desertions corps, which is about 1,500 strong. Political Agent, Khyber, reports all quiet Tirah. Danger of Afridi rising appears definitely to be past. Afridis of all sections are sending deputations to Abdul Qadyum which is rather embarrassing as it fills Khyber villages with armed men, and may lead to misunderstandings. Abdul Qiadyum has told them to go back and only come and see him in small numbers. Also, that if they wish to send &quot;a whole jirga it must not come to Khyber but will be seen at Peshawar. More details received Afridi Mohmands and Shinwaris looting Jalalabad on the 21st, Some Afghan soldiers tried to protect Government property and fired upon tribesmen who replied. Casualties on both sides. Afghan troops driven off. Mullah Said Akbar who was at Hadda was sent for to dissuade tribesmen looting. He did his best but was himself fired at and had to retire. Afridis returning to Tirah with very large quantity of loot. Kohat Pass Afridis quite quiet, largely owing to release of men 130th King George&apos;s Own Baluchis, by Comniander-in-Ohief. They have brought large quantity ammunition from Kahi and Jalalabad on pretext of Jehad and are now selling it at great profit. Leaflets of &quot; provisional Government of India &quot; already sent to you are being distributed from Khost. Punjab Government have lent me services of Mr. Douglas Donald. I am putting him in charge of Orakzai and other Kohat border tribes whom lie knows well. Bilarid Khel Wazirs leave for Khost. They may be going to get ammunition but if they join lashkar against ns I shall burn Biland KhaJ. Karbogha Mullah has refused to take part in any Jehad agitation and has forbidden his sons to do so. Tochi reports General Nadir Khan has sent six guns, stores and ammunition to Bari, three miles from Durand line at Charkhai and lashkars to other points. Nadir Khan is issuing ammunition to tribesmen, also large lashkar being sent to Kaitu. Impression of informers is that immediate attack is not expected. Kurram reports no change in situation. &apos; Wano&quot; reports payment of Mahsud allowances at Sarwekai progresses satisfactorily. Mahsuds will hold jirga at Kanigorum on 26th instant, when question of letters urging Jehad being (? will be) discussed. It is confirmed from several sources that Mullah Fazl Dili will urge neutrality and keep Mahsud boundary against both Governments. No further reports regarding approach of Afghans in Wano direction. Yesterday Political Assistant saw jirga of Wano Wazirs who are sending Nadir Khan letter refusing him passage through their country. They could not be trusted in the event of actual arrival of Afghans. Mehtar of Ohitral wires : &apos; Glad to inform you Afghans defeated by us in Bashgul; we took Istorgats and its bridge and crossed the Bashgul river. Fmemy casualties killed and wounded about 20 to 30 ; ours, one killed and two wounded slightly.
