RAMSAY MACDONALD.............................. &quot; 7PROSECUTIONS...................................... &quot; ireland........................................... &quot; 9SUMMARYThe most important event of the week has been the publication by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of a confidential circular issued by Home Forces. The effect of the disclosure has been to increase the circulation of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and to undo much of the good work which has been done by propaganda.    There are still misunderstandings about the meaning of the oircular which ought to be dispelled as early as possible.    Vforkingmen and soldiers both believe that armed force is to be used to break strikes and that the Government is hostile to civil trade unions.Unrest among the Police is threatening to take the form of a strike with the support of the Triple Alliance.The movement for resisting Income Tax on incomes below  250,which began among the miners in South stales seems to be spreading North.The beer and spirits shortage is still a principal oause of unrest among men engaged on hard manual work.A report is being circulated that on the signature of Peace the large stores will raise their food prioes in the belief that the oountry will be drained of food for the relief of Central Europe. If prices do rise it would be well to make the reason public  , for at present, Lord Parmoor&apos;s, &quot;Fight the Famine&quot; Committee is obtaining &quot;)a good deal of publicity.On the whole the general situation is satisfactory, though the fine weather huB brought out the usual type of revolutionary orator. People are generally more inclined now to listen to speakers of moderate views.
The Union offioials have had a seoret meeting with the&apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;.*offioiais of-the Triple Allianoe, at which.it was deoided . to issue ballot&apos; papers for another Pollae StrjLke on the question of the reinstatement of Constable Spackman.    If three-fifths prove to be in favour of a strike the Polioe will come out, supported by the Triple Allianoe.,    Negotiations to this end have been on foot for sometime, but Robert WIliLIkMS, who was the obstaole, has now oonsented.THjB &quot;DAILY HBRAItD&quot;.On May 13th, the &quot;Herald&quot; published a confidential oiroular from Home Forces whioh they deeoribe as &quot;an extra-ordinary and sinister document&quot;.    The,damage done by this publication oan soarcely be exaggerated, and. there is still muoh misunderstanding of its meaning both among the troops and workingmen,    The question, &quot;Will they (the troops) assist in strike breaking&quot;, is understood to mean that the troops are to be used against strikers, and the question, &quot;Whether there is not a growth of Trade Unionism among them&quot; , is. taken to refer to the Unions.to whioh men belong in oivil .  . life,. :    &apos;There is considerable feeling both in the Triple Alliance and among the soldiers against the Secretary of State for War, and I am informed that the Triple illiance ,  have been seriously considering a stoppage of work next week without notice, unless a statement is made that the...... a,. ..     &apos; ... *Ciroular is withdrawn and the Government admits that it was issued without its authority.The &quot;Herald&quot; has made great oapital out of this stolen dooument and there is information, not amounting to evidence, that H.T. moBOEMD, one of the &quot;Herald&quot; reporters, is inducing soldiers to steal other confidential papers.In/
In yesterday18 issue the publication is described by a Lobby correspondent as &quot;a flrstrolass newspaper aooop&quot;.    The -Circulation of the ^Herald&quot;, which was dwindling, is now reported to have greatly inoreased in consequence.    In Birmingham it is said to have nearly doubled, and it is , significant that it was being sold by 5.30 a.m, on May 13th and on subsequent days was being given away to men leaving work.    Fortunately, no newspaper which is run for propaganda ag well as for profit has a long and prosperous life.A.F. STfiPHAJi who was interned here as an enemy agent and has lately been repatriated to Germany has appeared in Switzerland and has offered to apt as an agent for the &quot;Dally Herald&quot;.    (This paper appears to ba supplied gratis to the British Expeditionary Force where it is known derisively as &quot;The Bolshevik Bull&quot;.  .A man named Viotor BEA.CHAM. a declared Bolshevik, speaking at Clapham Common on May 18th, recommended a working day of four hours five days a week;   that Buckingham Palaoe should become the publishing offioe of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;; and that the Red Flag should fly over all prisons.    The Poli(( could be dispensed with.    The speeoh is only mentioned beoause when he urged the soldiers present to throw down their arms if used &amp;b strike breakers, a man in.the uniform of the Irish Guards said that the soldiers would oertainly down tools in oase of labour trouble if assured of the support of Labour.Since the action taken on Friday week the Union has been struggling against dissolution.   The finances show a deficit/
(English) - 3 -deficit of  100 and great efforts are now being made to raise funds in the branches,    Commander MWO&amp;THY, M.P. has promised a weekly donation&apos; of 10/- and dden PAUL has promised to approach Mr. L^SBUEY for further aid,    The Committee have suspended MCDONALD from the Chair because of his absence at &quot;a critical, moment&quot; *  but really because he used the Union to obtain copy for the &quot;Herald&quot;.The Secretary from iVooiw:loh stated that the Woolwioh Branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Bailors and soldiers was discontented and would like to transfer to the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Union.    This Branch numbers many hundreds and is very revolutionary, isnd it is said that Woolwich may become the new headquarters.There is also a proposal to amalgamate the Union with the National Union of i3x-3ervi&apos;oe Men, inaugurated by  5x-Sergeant Blythe.TH3 FEDERATION 0? DISCHAflQgiD        DSMOBILlgBp. SA.IL0RS MjD gQIJDIERg.The Nottingham Branch, which numbers 3j000, have complained to the City Council that at their Sunday gatherings they are pestered by hawkers of revolutionary literature, and that if it were not for the restraint of the Committee there would be a serious&quot;breach of the peace.In Coventry the local branch is up in arms.against the Government for the insufficient allowances and -the bad housing conditions.    At present it is not affiliated to any of the Labour movements the Birmingham branoh has also held a protest meeting on.the same subject.The difficulty of this federation is that it has no*central organisation or concrete policy.    It is, in fact,merely/
merely an aggregation of local branches. NATIONAL COIHCIL&apos; FOR CIVIL LIBERT 109 \A Conference of this Council was held at Cardiff on luay 17th, &quot;Vernon HARTSHORN basing in the Chair.    x Resolution condemning Military Service Acts was seconded by James rorSTOIiE.    lie invited everyone to &quot;stem&apos;the tide of oligarchy&quot;.Resolutions have been passed at various meetings in South Wales protesting against the &quot;persecution&quot; of Coiincillo: MORGAi-1 JONES and demanding his immediate release.        j        jMETERS I K5F0HM COMMITTEE.John McLiUN. has lately been organising this movement in South ft/ales and Manchester.

letter, in whioh he mentions that he is bringing up his children to sing the &quot;Bed Flag&quot;,    It is a very foolish and oonoeited document.Professor L SS-8aiITH has written to the &quot;Herald&quot; (May 12th) suggesting that on the national holiday public demonstrations should be organised against militarism and the terms of the Treaty.POSTAL -iT BLACKPOOL. ;  .A correspondent states th,:.t the real business of the Conference was to ascertain how many Postal Servants would .      oome out if a strike was called.    A Leeds Delegate said that their aim should be to make the present position so difficult that the (Government would have to surrender the Post Office to the Postal Servants under the control of their Union.EDUCATION IN EWQLUTIOif.8.0. DAVU33, the Miners1 igent, states that there are 6o scholarships of  75 at the Central Labour College, London; that the competition for these scholarships was so great that oolleges are being opened all over the country to meet the demand.    DAVIS3 said he had failed in Soonomios beoause he could not agree with the text book.    The Economics which they would teach would be free from class distinction.    The eduoation is to be based upon the recognition of^the antagonism between Capital and Labour.In a letter to the &quot;Forward1, John MoLSaN appeals for  5,000 to start a Scottish Labour College; only  400 has yet been subscribed, but he hopes to start with 100 pupils on September 1st.British MWS3M^^^^iJ^iiS3M SERBS hussia.In an article in the Bolshevik paper the &quot;Pravda&apos; - forwhich\

They are proud cf the name &quot;Bolshevik&quot;, and when the time comes they will follow your example without hesitation&quot;.    The writer thinks that the British workers are progressively becoming revolutionary and their sympathy with Russia growing, but that there will be no revolutionary explosion unless there is a food shortage or an   industrial crisis.&quot;FIGHT THE FAMINE&quot; COFMITTEE.A-mass meeting, which is reported to have been crowded, was held at the albert Hall on the 19th.Lord PMOOB was in the chair supported by Robert 3MILLIE, Earl BEAUCMP, Lt.

poster and leaflets; this was brought to the notioe of the Director of Publio Prosecutions, but no action was advised as the offence was for not submitting them to the Press Bureau, &quot; he Herald&quot; could have published these leaflets originally without submitting them to the Press Bureau,as newspapers are exoluded from any application to submit under Regulation 270.IR8LAI.D.The recent campaign of the Sinn Feiners for a flat rate of 50/- a week for all labourers has shaken the allegiance of the farmers and small shopkeepers, and the Bolshevik speeches of Hiss Sylvia PAHKHURST - who was invited to Dublin by Countess MABKIBWIOZ - are not doing the Sinn Fein cause good service.    It is believed that when the Peace Terms are published and there is no mention of Ireland, there will be a recrudescence of outrages all over the country, but no attempt at open rebellion.    The real danger of the future lies not so much in the Sinn Feiners as in the Transport Workers.B. H. T.
